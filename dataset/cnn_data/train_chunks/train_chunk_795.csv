"By . Emma Reynolds . Slumped on his back with a sweet wrapper stuck to his wide face, this enormous orangutan appears to have overdone the bananas - and every other foodstuff within reach. The lethargic creature doesn't look capable of much monkey business, although keepers at his Indonesian zoo maintain he is a healthy weight. Udel, who is also seen here clumsily hauling his gigantic body through a pool of water, is just 3ft 11in tall and tips the scales at a whopping 15st 10lbs. Messy eater: Super-sized Udel furrows his brow in confusion as he searches for his sweet wrapper . The extra-large animal looks . fascinatingly human as he scratches his head, seemingly pondering where . his sweet has gone, while a telltale wrapper sticks to his chubby cheek. But the bulky animal survives on a healthy diet of fresh fruit and milk, according to Ragunan Zoo in Jakarta. Sun-worshipper: The lazy monkey lets it all hang out as he relaxes at Ragunan zoo in Indonesia . Photographer Youhanes 'Hendy' Widianto, 36, said: 'When I saw him, I couldn't believe how big he was. 'Everyone there was amazed by his size. 'At first I thought he must be so big because visitors to the zoo throw food and snacks to him - he even had a wrapper stuck to the side of his face. 'But according to the zoo he's actually a normal weight for its age.' Adult male orangutans can grow to 5ft 9in and a weight of about 19st. Udel is apparently still active and able to climb and swing with the other primates - although he looks rather sedentary in these pictures. Hendy said: 'He's definitely the biggest monkey I've ever seen. 'At 7am, the zoo feeds Udel with fruits. Then at 2pm they gave him fresh milk, and then at 4pm they gave him more fruits. 'As far as I know there are no plans to put it on any sort of diet. He had space of more than 100 square meters. 'Apparently he is still active and can move around, climb and hang on to a rope.' Orangutans spend most of their time in trees and are the largest of all arboreal animals. Fish out of water: The 3ft 11in, 15st 10lbs creature cools off with a quick dip - but he hardly looks streamlined . Fat face: The startlingly human Udel seems to yawn and then frown as wide crevices form in his puffy features .

"By . Simon Murphy . A website used by married people to have adulterous affairs is being accessed thousands of times a month from parliamentary computers used by MPs, peers and their staff, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Out Of Town Affairs, which brings together married men and women seeking sex, has been clicked on an astonishing 52,375 times in just seven months via computers exclusively used by members of the Houses of Parliament and their employees. In one month, Out Of Town Affairs received 289 Westminster hits a day. 'Dirty' dating: The sign-up page for the Out of Town Affairs website, which brings together married men and women seeking sex . Incredibly, the site had more hits in December from parliamentary computers than the official websites for the Treasury, Ministry of Justice and Department for Education. The website, which contains explicit pictures of subscribers, boasts: ‘We connect you with thousands of other married men and women looking for a marital affair or more heat in the bedroom. The variety of new members is fantastic.’ And the site adds: ‘Marital affairs in the UK [are] very popular – with more and more unsatisfied married men and women looking to do the dirty [on] their partners whilst out of town.’ Users are invited to contact ‘thousands of horny cheaters ready to get some action’ by signing up for a fee of £25 a month, which allows them to ‘write your own sex-date diary’ and ‘read and send filthy messages’. The Mail on Sunday made the discovery after submitting a Freedom of Information request, asking for the top 500 websites accessed on Parliament computers over the past year. In December, the website received 8,457 page views from computers based in the heart of the country’s democracy. In November, it received 7,533 hits, in October, 8,971 hits, in August, 5,174, in July, 7,493, in June, 6,822 and in February, 7,925. Hits: The website received 8,457 page views from computers at Westminster in the month of December alone . The owner of Out Of Town Affairs told The Mail on Sunday he was surprised that MPs or Lords were visiting the site. ‘That’s a lot of hits,’ he said. ‘It’s got to be more than one person going on the site from Parliament. I hope we don’t get hate mail from parliamentary wives now. ‘It’s an adult dating site, but you market it as an affairs website because that’s where all the Google searches come from.’ When they are not looking for affairs, Westminster internet users are spending time gambling, playing games, chatting on social network sites, or simply killing time. There are thousands of hits on gambling websites, while  i-am-bored.com, featuring ‘viral videos, games, memes, lists and social networking for when you’re bored’, had 21,371 hits in the last three months of 2012 alone. Facebook clocked up an astonishing 28 million hits over a year. Computer gaming is a popular Westminster pastime too, with chess and solitaire websites accessed thousands of times  a month. Online games such as FarmVille, Fairyland and Mafia Wars were also popular, while grooveshark.com, offering chart hits, received 709,740 hits in a year. Robert Oxley, campaign manager for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Taxpayers expect parliamentarians and their staff to spend their time making laws and scrutinising the Government, not looking for an affair.’ A Parliament spokesman said ‘more than 5,000 people’ had access to parliamentary network computers but that the Out Of Town Affairs website broke IT rules and had now been blocked. However, no investigation would be launched. She added: ‘We allow people to use the computers for personal use in non-working hours.’","Out of Town Affairs connects married men with women seeking sex .

"By . Amanda Williams . The rotting carcasses of almost 3,000 'diseased' pigs have been found floating upstream in Shanghai, following a police campaign to curb an illicit trade in infected meat. The swollen and distended animals- some of which had  their internal organs visible - have been pulled from the waters since Friday by China's authorities. It has caused concern amongst Shanghai residents and local media over the possibility of contamination to the city's water supply, though authorities say none has so far been detected. Revolting images of the carcasses in news reports and online blogs have caused a local outcry against officials. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO - WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Rotting carcasses of almost 3,000 'diseased' pigs have been found floating in upstream in Shanghai, following a police campaign to curb the illicit trade in infected meat . Sanitation workers collect a dead pig from the  waterway.  The swollen animals have been pulled from the waters since Friday by China's authorities . The discovery has caused concern amongst Shanghai residents and local media over the possibility of contamination to the city's water supply, though authorities say none has so far been detected . Lawyer Gan Yuanchun said on his microblog: 'Well, since there supposedly is no problem in drinking this water, please forward this message, if you agree, to ask Shanghai's party secretary, mayor and water authority leaders if they will be the first ones to drink this meat soup?' On Monday, Shanghai officials said the number of dumped adult and piglet carcasses retrieved had reached 2,813. The city government, citing monitoring authorities, said the drinking water quality has not been affected. Shanghai's Agriculture Committee said authorities do not know what caused the pigs to die, but that they have detected a sometimes-fatal pig disease in at least one of the carcasses. The disease is associated with the porcine circovirus, which is widespread in pigs but doesn't affect humans or other livestock. The dumping follows a clampdown on the illegal trade in contaminated pork. In . China, pigs that have died from disease should be either incinerated or . buried, but some unscrupulous farmers and animal control officials have . sold problematic carcasses to slaughterhouses. On Monday, Shanghai officials said the number of dumped adult and piglet carcasses retrieved had reached 2,813 . Cleaning workers retrieve the carcasses. The Huangpu River in Shanghai, is one of Shanghai's main water sources . A sanitation worker collects a dead pig with a stick. The revolting images of the carcasses in news reports and online blogs have caused a local outcry against officials . Shanghai's city government said initial investigations had found the dead pigs had come from Jiaxing city in neighboring Zhejiang province. It said it had not found any major epidemic. Huang Beibei, a lifetime resident of Shanghai, was the first to expose the problem when he took photos of the carcasses and uploaded them onto his microblog on Thursday. 'This is the water we are drinking,' Huang wrote. 'What is the government doing to address this?' His graphic photos apparently caught the attention of local reporters, who followed up. Huang said he's most concerned about water safety. 'Though the government says the water is safe, at least I do not believe it - given the number of the pigs in the river. These pigs have died from disease,' Huang said. The pork harvested from diseased carcasses has ended up in markets in the past. As . a food safety problem, it has drawn attention from China's Ministry of . Public Security, which has made it a priority to crack down on gangs . that buy dead diseased pigs and process them for illegal profits. Zhejiang . police said on their official website that police have been campaigning . to rid the market of unsafe pork meat and that the efforts were stepped . up this winter as Chinese families gathered to celebrate the Lunar New .

A dead pig floats on the river. The discovery of almost 3,000 carcasses has followed a police campaign to curb the illicit trade in sick pig parts . In one . operation last year, police in Jiaxing stamped out a criminal gang that . acquired and slaughtered diseased pigs. The provincial authorities said . police arrested 12 suspects and confiscated nearly 12 tons of tainted . pork meat. 'Ever since the . police have stepped up efforts to crack down on the illicit market of . sick pigs since last year, no one has come here to buy dead pigs, and . the problem of pig dumping is worse than ever this year,' an unnamed . villager told the Jiaxing Daily newspaper, which is run by the local . Communist Party. Wang Xianjun, a government worker for Zhulin village, told the newspaper that villagers were breeding too many pigs. Wang . said the village had 10,078 dead pigs in January and another 8,325 in . February. 'We have limited land in the village,' he said. 'We do not . have that much land for burial.' Zheng .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Demonstrations by supporters of President Mohamed Mursi and his opponents descended into violence today ahead of a final vote on an Islamist-influenced constitution tomorrow that has divided the country. The two opposing sides hurled rocks and stones at each other during a two-hour-long clash in Egypt's second largest city Alexandria over the controversial constitution which has deeply polarised the nation. Riot police swung batons and fired volleys of tear gas to separate the stone-throwing crowds, made up of Muslim Brotherhood members and ultraconservative Salafis on one side, and youthful liberal protesters on the other. Now watch the video . Violent clashes: Riot police were out in force in Alexandria, Egypt, today as demonstrations over the new constitution descended into violence . Opposing sides: A cordon of riot police and tear gas separates opponents of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi from his Islamist supporters in Alexandria on the eve of the second leg of voting on the country's contentious constitution . A human shield: Riot police form a barrier between the two clashing sides . The clashes started when the two groups met just after Friday afternoon prayers near the city's main mosque. The demonstrators, some of whom carried black Islamic battle flags, withdrew from the mosque area under a heavy cloud of tear gas nearly two hours after the clashes began. Fighting continued along the coastal road of the Mediterranean city, near the Medical School and famed Bibliotheca Alexandrina. At least 42 people were being treated for injuries, with some rushed to the hospital, a city health official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters. It was unclear who started the fight. Islamists had called for a big rally outside the Qaed Ibrahim mosque, and some 20 liberal political parties had said they would not hold a rival gathering to avoid clashes. Brutal: Egyptian supporters of President Mohamed Morsi help a wounded comrade during clashes with Morsi's opponents in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . Thousands became embroiled in the fighting after attending afternoon prayers near the city's main mosque . Protesters threw rocks and other debris at each other during the clashes . Security forces had cordoned off streets leading to the mosque as throngs of Salafi Islamists, most wearing the long beards favored by the movement, gathered for what they called 'the million-man rally to defend clerics and mosques'. Some chanted 'God is Great,' and warned opponents: 'with blood and soul, we redeem Islam'. The rally was called in response to violence last week, when a well-known Alexandrian Salafi cleric, Sheik Ahmed el-Mahalawi, was trapped inside a mosque for 12 hours while his supporters battled rock-throwing opponents outside with swords and firebombs. El-Mahalawi, 87, had stirred anger with a sermon in which he denounced opponents of the Islamist-friendly draft charter as 'followers of heretics'. He denied that in a sermon on Friday, accusing the media of spreading 'lies', and claiming that last week's clashes were meant to prevent voting on the constitutional referendum. Heavily armed: Police armed with batons march alongside riot vehicles in Egypt's second largest city . Islamist supporters of the president chanted 'God is great' and denounced opponents of the new constitution as 'followers of heretics' A woman shouts as she stands in front of riot policemen separating opponents of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi clashing with Islamist supporters of the president . The final round of voting on the disputed charter is to be completed on Saturday in the remaining 17 of Egypt's 27 provinces. Critics charge that the Islamist-dominated body that wrote the draft document did not represent all Egyptians. Liberal and Christian members quit the assembly to protest clauses and articles they say were rammed through by hardline members aiming to create a religious state. The opposition National Salvation Front reiterated its call on Friday for voters to oppose the document, and one of the group's leaders, Mohamed ElBaradei, urged President Mohamed Morsi to suspend the referendum and form a new constituent assembly. With election authorities, army and police preparing for Saturday's voting however, ElBaradei's televised message looked unlikely to shift Morsi's position. 'If this constitution passed, there will be no stability,' said Baradei, a Nobel Laureate and Egypt's leading pro-democracy advocate. The clashes come ahead of an important vote on the country's new constitution tomorrow . Police cordoned off many of the streets around the city that led to the main mosque . The first round of voting was held in 10 provinces last Saturday, including in Egypt's biggest cities, Cairo and Alexandria. Turnout was low, around 32 percent, and unofficial results showed around 56 percent of voters cast a 'yes' vote in support of the constitution. Rights groups and the opposition immediately filed complaints alleging irregularities. Controversy over the proposed constitution has in the past month plunged Egypt into political turmoil unprecedented since the February 2011 ouster of Hosni Mubarak, the longtime authoritarian and secular-minded ruler. The draft has split the country into two camps. On one side are the Islamists from the country's most organized group, The Muslim Brotherhood, from which President Mohammed Morsi hails, and their backers from various Salafi and former Jihadist groups. The opposition camp, led by the National Salvation Front, is an alliance of liberal parties and youth groups backed by Christians and moderate Muslims who fear the Brotherhood's attempts to monopolize power by passing a constitution that enshrines a greater role for clerics and Islamic law. Today's violent clashes come after several day of tense demonstrations and protests across Egypt . Egyptian riot police try to quell clashes between opponents and supporters of President Mohamed Morsi in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . Hundreds of thousands of Egyptians from both sides have rallied in the streets over the past month. The crisis peaked when Brotherhood supporters attacked an opposition sit-in outside the presidential palace in Cairo on Dec. 5. The ensuing violence left at least 10 dead and hundreds of injured on both sides. The crisis was compounded by Morsi's decision to rush the draft constitution to a referendum after an Islamist-dominated panel approved it, as well as his move last month to grant himself near-absolute powers, which were later rescinded. Morsi's moves have also split state institutions. The judiciary became another battleground, with the powerful Judges' Club calling on its members to boycott the vote while Brotherhood sympathizers in the legal system and other independents insisted on supervising it. Egyptian prosecutors held a sit-in protest to press Morsi-appointed prosecutor general Talaat Abdullah to resign on Monday. Abdullah resigned, then retracted his resignation on Thursday, raising the prospect of new protests by fellow prosecutors. Also, Zaghloul el-Balshi, the secretary general of the election committee who is also a judge and an aid to the country's justice minister, resigned Wednesday, citing health reasons. The media said his resignation was prompted by his inability to prevent voting violations in the first leg of the referendum.

"By . Damien Gayle . Apple has reportedly dished out £13million to compensate Swiss national rail operator SBB for using its famous clock without permission. The company agreed in October to pay a lump sum so it could continue using SBB's Swiss-designed station clock face on its iPads and iPhones. The size of the settlement was supposed to have been kept confidential, but a Swiss paper leaked details on its website, quoting several unnamed sources. Can you tell the time? Apple's iPad clock app (left) versus Mondaine's iconic clock face . SBB refused to confirm the report. In . October, however, it was confirmed that an agreement had been reached . between the railway operator and the Silicon Valley firm to license the . design. It came after Apple introduced the . clock face design - the same as FBB's, right down to the second-hand . ending in a circle - on devices using its latest operating system iOS6. SBB said then: 'For the use of the . clock face on certain Apple devices such as iPads and iPhones, the . parties have negotiated an arrangement that enables Apple to use the SBB . station clock under a license agreement.' The rail operator added: 'It is a design icon that has obviously lost none of its appeal in the digital age,' the SBB said. 'Even now, it symbolises the . innovation and reliability that are key qualities attributed to both SBB . and Switzerland as a whole.' Up close: Mondaine's designs are known world-wide . The iconic design was created by Hans . Hilfiker in 1944 and is still used in SBB's stations. Watchmaker . Mondaine helped spread it across the world after licensing it from the . train operator. Hilfiker designed the minimalist clock to help travellers check the time at a distance while hurrying to catch trains. In 1953, he added a red second hand in . the shape of a railway guard's signaling disc, which pauses briefly at . the top of each minute 'to enable trains to depart punctually,' as he . put it. The Design Museum in London and the . Museum of Modern Art in New York both included Hilfiker's clock among . examples of outstanding 20th-century design. SBB spokesman Reto Kormann in September confirmed that Apple had not asked for permission before doing using the design. He said at the time: 'We've approached Apple and told them that the rights for this clock belong to us.' Although he did add: 'We are proud that this icon of clock design is being used by a globally successful company.' Technology fans have noted before how many of Apple's iconic designs are remarkably similar to Braun products from the Fifties. Apple has been embroiled in a string . of lawsuits with rival technology firms, amid claims and counter-claims . of copying patents and designs for smartphones and tablet computers. The company paid SBB 20million Swiss . francs ($21million, 17million euros) for the right to use the clock face . design Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger reported.","Apple agreed to pay out lump sum to SBB in October after using the unique clock face design without first seeking permission .

"By . Emma Clark . William Goad was jailed in 2004 for child abuse and died in prison today . A paedophile who abused up to 3,500 boys over a 35-year period has died in prison. William Goad, 68, from Plymouth, Devon, who was jailed for life in 2004, died of natural causes at HMP Albany on the Isle of Wight, according to the Prison Service. The wealthy businessman is thought to have been Britain’s most prolific child abuser, with his sick assaults causing two of his victims to commit suicide. Goad was previously described in court as a ‘voracious, calculating, predatory and violent homosexual paedophile’ who boasted of beating his own ‘record’ of abusing 142 boys in a year. The court was told: ‘It is believed there has been no single defendant with more victims than his man.’ A spokeswoman said today: ‘HMP Albany prisoner, William Goad, was pronounced dead at 00.20 on October 20 2012. ‘He is believed to have died from natural causes. ‘As with all deaths in custody, the independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will conduct an investigation.’ Goad was jailed for a minimum term of six years after being convicted at Plymouth Crown Court of 14 serious sex assaults and two indecent assaults. Plymouth Crown Court was told he groomed his victims, aged between eight-years-old and 18-years-old, by offering them well-paid jobs in the string of shops and market stalls he owned, before inviting them back to his home. In 2010 one of Goad's victims, Ray Zolla from Newquay, was awarded a six-figure sum in damages for the abuse he suffered as a teenager.He said at the time the abuse had ‘totally consumed’ his life.","William Goad, 68, thought to be Britain's most prolific child abuser ."

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . The worst job in America is that of a lumberjack, according to a new ranking of the American job market. And the best is a mathematician, with an average salary of over $100,000, says CareerCast, which takes into account a combination of factors including income, environment, growth opportunity and stress. Following close behind lumberjacks, who earn a pitiful $24,000 a year, the most . awful occupation of 2014 is that of a newspaper reporter, and then an . active military personnel, while being a university professor and then a . statistician were found to be the next best jobs. Happy camper: Mathematicians, university professors and dental hygienists ranked amongst the best jobs of 2014, according to CareerCast, in terms of salary and overall job satisfaction (stock image) In contrast, being a university professor or a statistician were found to be among the best jobs. Being a whiz with numbers in today's job market provides a wide range of well-paid opportunities, according to mathematician Jessika Sobanski. 'Whether it’s new product sales, a start-up business model or an established TV station, for example, everything is based on numbers,' she says to CareerCast. Tenured university professors, though a . difficult role to score, enjoy highly rewarding careers, while software . engineers and computer systems analysts thrive in an ever-expanding . market where they are in high demand. Woeful job: Just behind lumberjacks, newspaper reporters and broadcasters were ranked as having some of the worst jobs in 2014, thanks mainly to the changing face of the media . Somewhat interestingly, dental hygienists come in at number six on the best jobs list, gifted with competitive salaries averaging $70,210 and flexible working hours, despite dentists historically having the second highest (after doctors) suicide rate of any profession in the U.S. Other healthcare roles in the top ten best jobs list include ear doctors, occupational therapists and speech pathologists. As for the . worst jobs in the U.S., a number of unsurprising roles cropped up, . including taxi drivers at number four, garbage collectors at number . eight and prison guards at number ten. Newspaper . reporters took the second spot, followed by broadcasters at number five; . high-stress, low-paid positions which are fast disappearing as print . publications fall into a black hole. Open wide: Dental hygienists were ranked as having the sixth best job this year in terms of wages and flexible hours, despite dentists actually having the second highest suicide rate of any profession in the U.S. New to the . list this year as the sixth worst job title was 'head cook' - not to . be confused with the esteemed role of a chef (celebrity or otherwise) - but . more hourly workers in chains or high school cafeterias.

"By . Sam Greenhill . Inseparable: Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of . Cambridge's sister, has a cup of Pimms watching the AEGON Championships . tennis tournament . It simply wouldn’t be the quintessential British summer without Wimbledon  and a glass or two of Pimm’s. But just in case there was any doubt, we now have Pippa Middleton to tell us so. The Duchess of Cambridge’s party-loving sister appears to have Pimm’s on the brain this month. The drink crops up again and again – often in gushing terms – in the ‘tips’ the socialite and part-time columnist gives on  entertaining in her latest magazine contributions. So much so, in fact, that her readers could not be blamed for wondering whether Pimm’s might be sponsoring her very vocal penchant for the drink. In a ‘Wimbledon diary’ column for this week’s Spectator magazine, the 29-year-old writes: ‘I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy a Pimm’s or three when I’m watching a game’, adding: ‘Only pints will do, frankly, since half the glass is ice anyway.’ She then refers readers to a recipe for making ice from her party-planning book Celebrate – which has been widely mocked for its self-evident tips such as having a bonfire on bonfire night, and storing cakes in airtight tins. The tennis fan, who is frequently pictured in the stands enjoying the drink, goes on to inform Spectator readers: ‘Pimm’s has become so identified with the tennis “brand” that it’s a cliché – but that doesn’t stop it  from being absolutely delicious, essential drinking in fact.’ The enthusiastic message is remarkably similar in her advice to readers of US magazine Vanity Fair, to which she was recently appointed ‘contributing editor’ and offers her thoughts on ‘classic British pastimes’. Her contribution to the latest issue begins: ‘There’s nothing better than watching the dramas unfold on the court whilst eating juicy strawberries and sipping Pimm’s  No.1 Cup.’ The socialite also reveals how she likes to ‘nod off unnoticed after one too many Pimm’s in the sun’. Her apparent obsession with Pimm’s was first aired in Celebrate, which was published last year. The . book has at least three references to the drink, including: ‘For a . Pimm’s Royale add a splash of Pimm’s to a glass and top with champagne.’ 'I'd be lying if I said I didn¿t enjoy a Pimm's': The party-loving socialite, journalist and author sucks up yet more of the stuff at Wimbledon in 2011. Diageo has denied she has any commercial link to the product . Miss Middleton, who has previously been accused of cashing in on her royal connections, also writes a monthly food column for Waitrose magazine called Pippa’s Friday Night Feasts. In the latest issue, she presents a Mexican feast, although admits she has never been to Mexico and took her inspiration from a local Mexican restaurant. She has responded to criticism of ‘glaringly obvious’ advice in Celebrate – such as  her observation that turkeys, ‘because of their size… are perfect for feeding larger gatherings’ – by arguing she has to ‘cover the basics’. She also laughed off as ‘all good fun’ a  parody Twitter account, @pippatips, which offers spoof advice such as: ‘Enjoy a glass of water by getting a clean glass and pouring in water from a tap or bottle. If you like cold water, add ice.’ Pimm’s manufacturer Diageo last night said it was not sponsoring Miss Middleton’s endorsements. A spokesman said: ‘Diageo has not paid Pippa Middleton to plug Pimm’s, though we are happy she seems to like the product.’ Miss Middleton’s spokesman did not respond to requests for a comment.","The Duchess of Cambridge's sister constantly refers to the drink .

"Increased demand for meat including tusks and sex organs . Meat order was allegedly made by Phuket restaurants . By . Jill Reilly . Updated: . 09:54 EST, 27 January 2012 . The elephant, a national symbol in Thailand, is facing a new threat because of a developing taste for its meat in the country, it was claimed today. The new interest in consuming the animal includes everything from trunks to sex organs, and could pose a significant risk to the survival of the species. Wildlife officials said that they were alerted to the practice after finding two elephants slaughtered last month in a national park in western Thailand. At risk: Although elephant poaching is illegal in Thailand, the new taste for eating their meat includes everything from trunks to sex organs, posing a significant risk to the survival of the species . 'The poachers took away the elephants' sex organs and trunks ... for human consumption,' Damrong Phidet, director-general of Thailand's wildlife agency, said in a telephone interview. He said that some of the meat was being consumed raw, in a elephant meat sushi style. Poachers typically just remove tusks, which are most commonly found on Asian male elephants and command high figures on the black market. But a market for elephant meat, could lead to killing of the wider elephant population, Damrong said. 'If you keep hunting elephants for this, then they'll become extinct,' he said. Order: Damrong Phidet, director-general of Thailand's wildlife agency said the elephant meat was ordered by restaurants in seaside destination Phuket, but it wasn't clear if the diners were foreigners . Consuming elephant meat is not common in Thailand, but some Asian cultures believe consuming animals' reproductive organs can boost sexual prowess. Damrong said the elephant meat was ordered by restaurants in Phuket, a popular travel destination in the country's south. It wasn't clear if the diners were foreigners. The accusation drew a quick rebuttal from Phuket Governor Tri Akradecha, who told Thai media that he had never heard of such restaurants but ordered officials to look into the matter. The trend is a worry because poaching elephants is already banned in the country, and trafficking or possessing poached animal parts also is illegal. Elephant tusks are sought in the illegal ivory trade, and baby wild elephants are sometimes poached to be trained for talent shows. 'The situation has come to a crisis point. The longer we allow these cruel acts to happen, the sooner they will become extinct,' Damrong said. The quest for ivory remains the top reason poachers kill elephants in Thailand, other environmentalists say. Show: Elephant tusks are sought in the illegal ivory trade, and baby wild elephants are sometimes poached to be trained for talent shows . Soraida Salwala, the founder of Friends of the Asian Elephant foundation, said a full grown pair of tusks could be sold from 1 million to 2 million baht (Â£20,000 to Â£40,300), while the estimated value of an elephant's penis is more than 30,000 baht (Â£607). 'There's only a handful of people who like to eat elephant meat, but once there's demand, poachers will find it hard to resist the big money,' she cautioned. Thailand has fewer than 3,000 wild elephants and about 4,000 domesticated elephants, according to the National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department.","Increased demand for meat including tusks and sex organs .

"By . William Turvill . A university student threw acid in the face of a friend in a copycat version of the attack on model Katie Piper because she was jealous of her good looks, a court heard yesterday. Mary Konye, 21, allegedly disguised herself in a Muslim veil and followed Naomi Oni home before attacking the Victoria’s Secret lingerie shop assistant, who is said to have once called her ugly. Miss Oni, also 21, screamed and could smell her skin and hair burning, the jury heard. She ran home where her family tried frantically to wash off the acid. Scroll down for video . Naomi Oni (pictured) had sulphuric acid thrown on her in an attack inspired by the assault of Katie Piper . But she lost the skin from her face, . and has permanent scarring over her body, the court was told. Her . clothes tested positive for sulphuric acid.  Konye – who had allegedly . told a friend she wanted to throw acid at Miss Oni – denies the attack . and being jealous. The . Hertfordshire University business and finance student knew that Miss Oni . – a friend since secondary school – had been deeply moved by the widely . reported case of Miss Piper, Snaresbrook Crown Court in East London . heard. This photograph shows Ms Oni before the attack, which took place on December 31 2012 . The model and TV . presenter was badly scarred and left blind in one eye after she had . sulphuric acid thrown in her face in a 2008 attack arranged by her . ex-boyfriend Daniel Lynch. Gareth . Patterson, prosecuting, told jurors: ‘Naomi will tell you about her . friendship with the defendant. She will tell you how in the past they . had an up and down relationship and how the defendant had admitted to . her that on one occasion in anger she threatened to throw acid at Naomi. ‘There . was a reason why the defendant would have chosen to make such an . unusual sort of threat. In the past the two of them had discussed a . young woman called Katie Piper. ‘Naomi . and the defendant had discussed this and it appears that the defendant . knew that Naomi had been particularly moved by Katie Piper’s ordeal. ‘Naomi . stated that she and the defendant had fallen out in the past and says . that there was an occasion during a row when she called the defendant . ugly. ‘She says they were . later back on speaking terms and that the defendant said to her that she . [the defendant] had been so angry at the time that she had said to . someone else that she wanted to throw acid at Naomi.’ The attack on Ms Oni was inspired by the acid assault on Katie Piper (pictured), Snaresbrook heard . Before . the attack early on December 30, 2012, Miss Oni was described as a . ‘good-looking young woman’ interested in fashion and beauty. The . court heard she left work at the Westfield shopping centre in . Stratford, East London, at around 11.30pm. CCTV footage shows a figure . in a niqab with only her eyes visible who ‘lingered, waiting to see the . victim’ and ‘tailed her home’ walking a few steps behind her, Mr . Patterson said. He added: . ‘All of a sudden Naomi felt a liquid being thrown into her face. She . screamed and felt her face burning. She could smell her skin and hair . burning.’ Jurors heard Ms Oni (pictured) was oblivious to the fact she was being closely followed by Konye wearing a full niqab, a hooded black coat, gloves and a grey bag . Miss Oni’s mother . described her as ‘crying hysterically’ when she arrived home in . Dagenham. Her family said her hair weave was disintegrating, as were her . leggings and her top. Mr . Patterson said there was ‘visible burning to her nose, cheeks and chin . and also to her right wrist, hand, stomach area and left thigh’.

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated Press Reporter . An Iraqi immigrant has been found guilty of bludgeoning his wife to death in their suburban San Diego home, in a case that was initially considered a hate crime. Kassim Alhimidi, 49, shook his head from side to side as the verdict was read and chaos erupted in the courtroom as another man stood and shouted obscenities. Alhimidi turned to the man and yelled in Arabic. That man struggled with officers as he was removed. The judge and the jury also left the courtroom before the hearing could conclude. Alhimidi now faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Court bailiffs restrain 49-year-old Kassim Alhimidi after a jury found him guilty of the first degree murder of his 32-year-old wife Shaima Alhimidi as the verdict was announced in a courtroom at El Cajon, California, on Thursday . He was charged with murdering his 32-year-old wife, Shaima Alawadi, in El . Cajon, home to one of the largest enclaves of Iraqi immigrants in the . U.S. Prosecutors argued that the 49-year-old . defendant lied to police about his troubled marriage and apologized to . his wife as she lay dying in a hospital. Defense lawyers said Alhimidi . loved his wife. Investigators initially considered . the March 2012 killing a hate crime after a note was found near the body . that read: 'This is my country, go back to yours, you terrorist.' Alhimidi had wailed during opening statements in court on Tuesday, prompting a judge to briefly halt the proceedings. No weapon were found in the brutal slaying but prosecutor Kurt Mechals claimed that other evidence proved Alawadi died at the hands of her spouse. Alhimidi, 49, had pleaded not guilty in the case that evolved from being a suspected hate crime to one about a family that had struggled trying to straddle two cultures. Tears: Kassim Alhimidi had wailed during opening statements in court on Tuesday, prompting a judge to briefly halt the proceedings . Killed: Alawadi, 32, was found beaten and unconscious in her San Diego home in March 2012 . Mechals told jurors that local and . federal police initially investigated the bludgeoning as a hate crime . after a note was found near the body that read: 'This is my country, go . back to yours, you terrorist.' However, . street camera footage and information from the couple's eldest daughter . about her parents' troubled marriage led police to charge Alhimidi. Lab tests found the note was a photocopy . - possibly of a note found outside the family home a week earlier by . one of the couple's five children. Detectives also found documents in Alawadi's car indicating she planned to seek a divorce. Alawadi, . who wore a headscarf, was found by the couple's daughter Fatima, then 17, in a pool of blood on the . kitchen floor with her body tangled in a computer cord and desk chair. She had multiple skull fractures from blunt force and died two days . after the attack. A sliding glass door was shattered. 'To this day, we still don't know what the object was,' Mechals told jurors. However, a medical examiner is expected to testify that it appeared Alawadi was beaten with a tire iron. Final journey: Family and friends escort Mrs Alawadi's body to a waiting hearse following the memorial service in 2012 . Defense . attorney Douglas Gilliland said the prosecution has no solid evidence . and instead based its case on interpretations of blood stains on the . floor, street camera footage tracking Alhimidi's van, and information . from the couple's daughter, Fatima, who had been at odds with her Muslim . parents over dating a Christian boy. Gilliland said no blood or shards of glass from the shattered door were found on Alhimidi. Gilliland . pointed out that Alhimidi, who is not fluent in English, has cooperated . with authorities, even returned early from Iraq, where he buried his . wife. He also said Fatima has given conflicting reports, saying at first . that she saw an intruder and later that she only saw her mother . bleeding on the floor when she came downstairs. Mechals . described Alhimidi as a man who was distraught over his wife's plan to . leave him and had urged his children and relatives to get her to stay. Crime scene: The fatal attack took place at the family's house, pictured, in El Cajon, California . After . the attack, Alhimidi went to the hospital, touched his wife as she lay . unconscious in bed, and apologized to her, Mechals said. An uncle of the . children who was present told authorities that Alhimidi then turned to . him and said that if his wife woke up, she might try to say that he had . attacked her. 'If Shaima Alawadi did wake up, she would have said he did this to her, because he did,' Mechals told jurors. Gilliland countered that the uncle always disliked Alhimidi, and cultural misunderstandings have clouded the truth. The defense lawyer said Muslims often apologize to loved ones who are dying for all the things that they did or didn't do for them in their lives. In U.S. courts, that can be seen as an admission of guilt, he said. 'It doesn't translate,' Gilliland told jurors. Prosecutors say camera footage indicates that Alhimidi might have driven a short distance from home on the day of the attack and parked his car - contradicting his story to investigators that he had gone for a drive to relax. The footage shows a person getting out of a parked red car resembling Alhimidi's vehicle around the corner from the home and then walking back to the vehicle an hour later.","Kassim Alhimidi has been found guilty of killing his 32-year-old wife Shaima Alawadi on March 21, 2012, in San Diego .

"By . Joshua Gardner . Are you afraid of the future? That's the gist of what a new Pew study out Thursday asked Americans. And the answer looks like no. Though there are plenty of exceptions, Americans said they generally embrace the future of science and technology. However, a majority of Americans have a negative view of many up-and-coming technologies like drones, cybernetic implants or worn technologies like Google Glass and DNA modification for humans. Sorry Google Glass, the verdict is in and a majority of Americans find cyborg-like devices and implants too creepy . They may be a boon for the folks at Amazon but most Americans think drones are worrisome addition to our skies . Google is also out of luck with it's driverless car, says the recent Pew study, which found that 50 percent wouldn't even get inside . One example of where respondents to the Pew Research Center study was the driverless car. Google wants us all to have our very own and laws are even springing up to help pave the way. But Pew found that 50 percent of Americans would not get inside one. Also related to the tech giant was the finding that 53 percent think a future where people wear or implant technology that constantly feeds them information would be change for the worse. Sorry Google Glass! Another internet company, Amazon, will be interested to hear Pew's finding that 63 percent of Americans say opening U.S. airspace to drones is a bad idea. While scientists recently managed to grow a hamburger in vitro, a huge 80 percent of Americans say they would decline to eat it. The Pew Research shows that Americans overall have a rosie view of technologies overall, but certain developments--even those we're on the cusp of making--have them worried . Seems unlikely: A surprising 39 percent of Americans think teleportation could happen in their lifetimes . And 66 percent feel that giving parents the ability to alter their baby's DNA to make them smarter, healthier or more athletic would be a dangerous thing. Despite their trepidations, 59 percent of Americans think technological changes in general will have a positive effect on society. Unlike food, we're comfortable with lab grown organs at least in as much as 80 percent of adults believe such things will be improving our lives within 50 years. But plenty of potential advancements that have become sci-fi staples just don't seem likely as much as we'd like them to come to be. A surprising 39 percent of adults think scientitists will have invented teleportation in 50 years. A healthy 56 percent have their doubts. Sixty-four percent think long-term space colonies are too far fetched and back on earth, 77 percent doubt we'll be controlling the weather in 50 years.

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greig . State agents have seized a polygamous group's Texas ranch where hundreds of children were removed during a 2008 FBI raid prompted by child sex abuse allegations. The group's leader, Warren Jeffs, is serving life in prison after being convicted of sexually assaulting two girls he took as child brides. The Texas Department of Public Safety says its agents took possession of the secluded property near Eldorado on Thursday. Ranch seizure: Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Shawn Baxter waits to advise media at the Yearning for Zion Ranch on Thursday . Secluded community: The Yearning for Zion Ranch, the Fundametalist Latter Day Saints compound that was once home to a polygamist cult . In a statement, DPS says authorities were helping the remaining eight adults living on the ranch leave and to do an inventory. A judge in January ordered the forfeiture of the Yearning For Zion Ranch, which was owned by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The state sought to seize the property over allegations of mismanagement by Jeffs. According to KSBW, the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Schleicher County Sheriff's Office met Wednesday afternoon with two residents of the Yearning for Zion Ranch who told them eight adults are currently living there. Much changed: Warren Jeffs seen in court in 2007 (left) and in a prison mugshot in 2011 (right) Polygamist ranch: State agents have seized the Eldorado property, which belonged to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and was where hundreds of children were removed during a 2008 FBI raid prompted by child sex abuse allegations . 'Law enforcement personnel are working with the occupants of the ranch to take all reasonable actions to assist with their departure of the property, to preserve the property, and to successfully execute the court order,' the state agency said. The ranch was raided in 2008 after phone calls to a family violence hotline alleged abuse and rape. Police removed some 468 children from the ranch, and another 130 women left voluntarily. The children were eventually returned after the Supreme Court rule there was no indication they were in imminent danger. Created specifically as a center for Warren Jeffs' leadership of Mormon Fundamentalists, the 1,700-acre Yearning for Zion Ranch once had about 700 inhabitants. Jeffs was convicted in 2011 of sexually assaulting two minors whom he described as his spiritual wives. At trial, prosecutors presented DNA evidence to show he fathered a child with one of those girls, aged 15. First raid: Vehicles belonging to law enforcement and other investigators are parked near the main temple building at the Yearning for Zion (YFZ) Ranch, the FLDS compound, near Eldorado, Texas in 2008 . Jeffs, 58, is serving a life prison term in Texas. He has continued to try to lead his roughly 10,000 followers from behind bars. The sect is a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism whose members believe polygamy brings exaltation in heaven. Online records from the Schleicher County Appraisal District indicate a dozen pieces of property at the ranch's address that are owned by the trust and total 1,691 acres. Combined, the most recent appraised value of the properties is $33.4 million. Jeffs' most devoted followers consider him God's spokesman on earth and a prophet, but they were absent from court for the bulk of his criminal trial. Paving the way to Jeffs' conviction were his own 'priesthood records' - diary-like volumes, covering tens of thousands of pages, in which Jeffs recounted his sexual encounters and records even his most mundane daily activities. Largely abandoned: Aerial view of the main temple building and two-story family homes at the Yearning for Zion (YFZ) Ranch, the FLDS compound, near Eldorado, Texas . 'This will be a major gathering place of the saints that are driven,' Jeffs wrote of the ranch. 'You can see it is well isolated. In looking at this location, we can raise crops all year round. There is no building code requirements. We can build as we wish without inspectors coming in.' Jeffs wanted the 'a rural location where the FLDS could operate a polygamist compound where the systemic sexual assault of children would be tolerated without interference from law enforcement authorities,' according to the affidavit. The ranch was largely abandoned after Jeffs' conviction and neighbors told Fox 13 that most of the polygamists have moved to other enclaves in South Dakota, Colorado, Arizona and Utah.","Agents from the Texas Department of Public Safety have taken possession of a polygamist group's ranch .

"By . Associated Press . and Snejana Farberov . An Arizona woman convicted of bludgeoning her husband to death with a hammer made a tearful plea for mercy Thursday, telling the jury deciding her fate that she is sorry for her actions and wishes she could go back and undo the pain she caused. Marissa Devault, 36, broke down in tears and repeatedly lost her composure as she spoke to the jury in the penalty phase of her trial. The same jury that convicted her of first-degree murder is deciding whether she should get the death penalty or a life sentence. 'I don't know if I can be useful to anybody in this world or in any way ... but I would like the opportunity to try,' she said. Fighting for her life: Marissa Devault had an emotional day in court Thursday as she tried to convince a jury to spare her the death sentence for killing her husband . Murdered: Devault was found guilty last week of brutally beating her husband Dale Harrell (pictured) to death in 2009, while trying to repay $300,000 in loans to her 'sugar-daddy' boyfriend . Devault was found guilty last week in the killing of Dale Harrell, who suffered multiple skull fractures in the January 2009 attack in the couple's home in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert. The penalty phase began this week and featured emotional testimony from Devault's daughters a day earlier. Devault clasped a tissue, removed her glasses, took deep breaths and fought back tears for more than 10 minutes. She expressed regret for inflicting pain on her daughters, saying 'this goes into generations that don't even exist yet.' 'I can't do anything more than say I'm sorry. I can't push the back button. I can't bring him back. I can't fix everything that was wrong,' she said. She also looked ahead to prison and hoped that she could 'talk to someone' and help them make a better choice. Prosecutors say she killed her husband in a failed bid to collect on a life insurance policy to repay more than $300,000 in loans from her boyfriend, a man 20 years her senior she met on a sugar-daddy website. Devault said she killed Harrell in self-defense and told investigators he had physically and sexually abused her in the past. In an interrogation video recorded just hours after the bloody attack, Devault could be seen chuckling as she recounts the events of the night, raising her arm in a motion mimicking hammer blows. â€˜I saw a hammer go into Darrellâ€™s head,â€™ she says with a nervous smile. Disturbing: Devault is seen smiling while demonstrating for investigators just hours after the attack how the hammer (right) entered her husband's skull . She would become the third woman on Arizona's death row if the jury opts for the death penalty. The . case had similar circumstances as the Jodi Arias trial that played out . in Phoenix one year ago, including a brutal killing of a lover, claims . of self-defense and salacious elements such as Devault's one-time job as . a stripper. And the similarities between the two women do not end there: the cases were tried in the same Maricopa County courtroom, and both Arias and Devault could face the death penalty. End of the road: Marissa Devault looked hopeless in court on April 8 as she was found guilty of killing her husband . With their long dark hair and eyeglasses, the two women even look strangely alike. It has been reported that the 36-year-old Devault befriended the 33-year-old convicted killer while the two were in jail together. But the judge in this case made extensive efforts to keep the trial from becoming the spectacle that enveloped the Arias case. Key witness: Businessman Allen Flores, who was Devault's boyfriend, testified for the prosecution against the woman who owed him $300,000 .","Marissa Devault, 36, was convicted earlier this month of first-degree murder in connection to her husband's 2009 killing .

"By . Dan Bloom . Smooth operator: Police claim Alejandra Tobon carried out cosmetic surgery in her garage . Police have arrested a woman who they claim gave Botox, fillers and vitamin injections illegally after turning her garage into a doctor's office. Alejandra Tobon's house in Pembroke Pines, Florida, was raided yesterday after an informant claiming to be a former patient had an allergic reaction to a Botox jab. They say the 43-year-old converted her garage 'to have the appearance of a doctor's office' where she also gave plasma and Carboxy therapy without a license. Although Tobon is registered by the Medical Quality Assurance Services of Florida, the register says she has only gained two licenses in other disciplines, according to checks made by MailOnline. One certified her as a massage therapist in 2003 and the other as an electrologist in 2009. Pembroke Pines Police are appealing for more alleged victims to come forward. A spokesman said: 'Investigation revealed that the listed suspect was performing unlicensed cosmetic procedures inside the garage of her residence. 'The garage was converted to have the appearance of a doctor's office. 'Some of the procedures the suspect was performing included Botox injections, filler injections, vitamin injections, plasma therapy and Carboxy therapy.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . Chipotle has announced that it will soon raise prices for its burritos, bowls and tacos as sales continue to rise. The fast food chain said Thursday that it is making the move to counteract rising costs. Menu boards with the new prices should start rolling out in coming weeks and be in place at all restaurants by this summer. Executives have said in the past they were considering a hike of about 3 percent to 5 percent. That translates to an extra 24 cents to 50 cents for an $8 burrito bowl across most locations. It is the first price increase in three years . Rising tide: Chipotle's sales are up 13 per cent, and it's prices are expected to rise by as much as five per cent . Company executives are convinced that raising prices will not hurt the bottom line. Jack Hartung, Chipotle's chief financial officer, said during a conference call with analysts that price is not the main reason customers visit its restaurants anyway. 'Most of the value comes from the experience,' he said. Hartung also noted that the company had earned 'permission' from customers to raise prices because of that experience. And if needed, he said Chipotle still had the leeway to further raise prices without scaring off customers. 'We've still got room,' he said. The decision comes as costs for beef have risen 25 per cent, according to Reuters. Higher costs for avocados and cheese have also pressured profit margins for the chain, with net income for the first quarter coming in below Wall Street expectations. Still, Chipotle said sales at established locations rose 13.4 percent during the period and it raised its outlook for the year. It now expects the sales figure to grow in the high-single digits, before factoring in the price hikes. The Denver-based chain's popularity has surged in recent years because people like that they watch as they tell workers what toppings to put on their orders. The chain has also invested in marketing to build up its reputation as higher-quality alternative to places like Burger King and Wendy's. Lowering margins: The chain blamed rising food costs for the first price hike in three years . Traditional burger chains have struggled to grow sales as customers increasingly flock to foods they feel are fresh or higher in quality. In contrast to Chipotle, for instance, McDonald's has said it needs to focus on underscoring the value it offers. McDonald's CEO Don Thompson has also noted that there is a bit of 'bifurcation' in the fast-food industry, with better-off customers heading to the new breed of chains that charge more. For the three months ended March 31, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. said net income rose 8 percent to $83.1 million, or $2.64 per share. That's up from $76.6 million, or $2.45 per share, a year ago. Analysts expected $2.86 per share, according to FactSet. Revenue climbed a stronger-than-expected 24 percent to $904.2 million. Chipotle has also been expanding rapidly. It opened 44 restaurants during the quarter and plans to open 180 to 195 restaurants during all of 2014. It already has more than 1,600 locations. Its shares fell $22.96, or 4.2 percent, to $529.44 in afternoon trading. Its shares are up almost 70 percent since a year ago.","The Denver-based chain is expected to raise prices as much as five per cent - about 24 to 50 cents per burrito bowl .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . A South Carolina construction worker got more than he bargained for when he helped himself to a refill of his 89-cent drink at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

Costly mistake: The ticket lists a $500 fine and a $25 processing fee . Lewis says he has refilled his drink before without paying and it wasn't an issue. 'As I was filling my cup up, I turned to walk off and a fella grabbed me by the arm and asked me was I going to pay for that, and I told him I wasn't aware that I had to pay for that,' he told the station. He claims he tried to pay for the drink but was never given the opportunity. 'I never had an option to make right what I had done wrong,' said Lewis. He instead was taken to a room where he was handed a criminal citation for shoplifting and told never to return. 'I'm done there': Lewis says he was told not to go back to where he works, effectively firing him from his job . He didn't pay: The ticket lists shoplifting as the offense . 'I'm done there, at the VA hospital, I'm not allowed to go on the premises anymore,' he said. I asked him can I still work on the job site and just bring my lunch and not go to the cafeteria and he said he wanted me off the premises.' The medical center said in a statement that the VA doesn't determine the amount of the fine, but that federal police are there to enforce the law. 'A Federal citation was issued for shoplifting in the VA cafeteria to an individual who stated to VA police he had not paid for refills of beverages on multiple occasions, even though signs are posted in the cafeteria informing patrons refills are not free,' said the statement. 'Shoplifting is a crime. The dollar amount of the ticket is not determined by VA as it is a Federal citation.' The hospital also claims that Lewis was belligerent during his discussion with police, something he denies. 'I was respectful,' he said. Lewis insists he is not a crook and plans to contest the fine in court. 'I want everybody to know that I made a simple mistake, that I'm not a thief, that I'm not dishonest,' Lewis argued. 'I'm trying to do the right thing.'","Christopher Lewis claims he refilled his drink multiple times in the past without paying and it was never a problem .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Secret audio recordings of New Mexico governor Susana Martinez lambasting her opponent in the 2010 gubernatorial race as 'little b****' were revealed on Wednesday. The country's first female Hispanic governor is also caught on tape questioning the purpose of a cabinet-level position for a member of the state's commission on women. The controversial recordings, released by left-wing publication Mother Jones, also include a clip of a Martinez adviser condescendingly discussing the inability of one of the state's Hispanic legislator's to fluently speak English. Scroll down for audio . Secret recordings of New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez, pictured in January, were released Wednesday that frame the popular governor unfavorably . 'I'm so tired of that little b**** calling me a liar,' Martinez can be heard saying of then-Lieutenant Governor Diane Denish in a five-second clip. The clip provided by Mother Jones provides no context for the statement, but the publication's accompanying story claims Martinez made the comment while watching a tape of their recent debate, and the Martinez campaign has not refuted it. In a longer clip Martinez refers to a woman who came up to her at an event and said she worked for for the state's commission on the Status of Women and claimed to be a cabinet-level official. 'What the hell is that?' Martinez asks. After her deputy campaign manager confirms the position to her, Martinez reiterates her confusion about the purpose of the position. 'I just don't know what they do. I understand that we have ten cabinet . positions, more than the federal government, but some of these seem to . be in name only,' she says. 'I don't get what the hell does a position on women's . cabinet do all day long?' 'But she sure was my best friend all day long,' Martinez adds, laughing, at which point the male deputy campaign manager makes a joke about another male campaign adviser wanting to be appointed to the commission so that he can study women. 'Oh, s***,' Martinez responds, still laughing. In this Aug. 19, 2010 file photo, gubernatorial candidates Diane Denish, left, and Susana Martinez, right, prepare to square off during a Mexico Gubernatorial Debate. In this historic race New Mexico elected its first female governor . In the audio recordings a Martinez adviser says that former New Mexico House Speaker Ben Lujan sounds like a 'retard' when he speaks in English. Lujan is pictured here in Feb. 18, 2010. He passed away in 2012 . Martinez's deputy campaign manager can also be heard in another clip making fun of the state's former speaker of the House, Ben Lujan. 'Somebody told me he's absolutely eloquent in Spanish, but his English? He sounds like a retard.' Lujan passed away in 2012 after a battle with cancer. Mother Jones is the publication responsible for releasing the infamous '47 percent' video that irreparably damaged former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romeny's 2012 presidential bid. The audio clips Mother Jones released of Martinez were part of a longer profile the publication published framing Martinez as 'nasty, juvenile, and vindictive.' The article's author, Andy Kroll, likens Martinez to 'brash,' embattled New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Martinez, a Republican who is up for reelection this year, and her advisers seem unfazed by the recordings, however. In a statement posted on Martinez's campaign website, spokesman Chris Sanchez played Mother Jone's article and its release of the recordings off as 'cheap political attacks,' as well as an attempt to 'smear' Martinez in order to undercut the Republican Party's standing with Hispanics. 'Today, an extreme left-wing blog posted four-year-old material from private conversations undoubtedly sent to them by individuals or their allies who are either under federal indictment, or have had their homes raided by the FBI for their role in stealing or distributing Governor Susana Martinezâ€™s email,' Sanchez wrote. 'That the national Left is trying to smear the first Hispanic woman governor in American history because they view her as a threat is about as surprising as the National Enquirer reporting that Elvis is still alive.' The statement goes on to snarkily address the Governor's use of the b-word in the recordings. 'Yes, the Governor used salty language in a private conversation four years ago with close advisers and will pay the appropriate penalty to the cuss jar.' A strategist familiar with the campaign's thinking predicted that the recordings would actually help Martinez in her governor's race. 'People actually want a tough Governor,'  the source said, adding that New Mexico is still a 'Wild Wild West' of sorts and that the 'machismo' spirit is rewarded there. 'Strong women advance in politics,' the strategist continued. 'She is a woman, and she can kind of get away with that more.' 'People want . her to do well. People look at her and want her to stand up and fight.' The strategist admitted that what the campaign's adviser said about Lujan was 'crazy, but its certainly not a Bridgegate' In its article on Martinez, Mother Jones likens the New Mexico governor's behavior in the secret recordings to that of embattled New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. A source close to Martinez rejected that comparison, saying the recordings are no 'Bridgegate' Bridgegate is the scandal afflicting Chris Christie's adminstration in which the governor's staff took retribution on a political foe by closing lanes on a major bridge in New Jersey, trapping cars on the bridge for hours. Martinez has consistently had one of the highest approval ratings for a state leader since she took office. A recent poll of New Mexicans put her approval rating at 52 percent. The same poll found her leading her most likely opponent, state Attorney General Gary King, by five points with 47 percent of the vote. She is expected to win the Governor's race and is considered a potential dark horse candidate in the 2016 election.","Liberal publication Mother Jones published secret audio recordings of New Mexico governor Susana Martinez on Wednesday .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Millions of Americans are misdiagnosed by doctors every year, and the mistakes have sometimes led to dire consequences, a new study has revealed. One in 20, or 12million, people have been shown to receive the wrong diagnosis at outpatient facilities across the U.S. These errors kill almost 100,000 people per year, according to a separate study. ‘The harm from misdiagnosis occurs when the correct treatment is delayed or when you get an inappropriate treatment or test,’ Hardeep Singh, author of the study published in BMJ Quality and Safety journal, told Vox. Seek a second opinion: A clean bill of health may not mean one is healthy . ‘What we say is, was there a missed opportunity? Was there some kind of a red flag?’ He said to NBC News. Researchers analyzed the findings of three previous surveys that sought to quantify the results of diagnosis and follow up visits to come to their conclusion. One of the studies quantified the rates of misdiagnosis from primary care physicians, and the other two examined the rates of colorectal and lung cancer screenings and diagnoses, according to CBS News. ‘Although it is unknown how many patients will be harmed from diagnostic errors, our previous work suggests that about one-half of diagnostic errors have the potential to lead to severe harm,’ the study authors wrote. Another survey cited by Hardeep’s team found misdiagnosis rates to be as high as 10 per cent, but he explained to Vox that this is only further proof of the problem faced by American patients. A separate study found that about 98,000 people die each year from the wrong medical diagnosis. Follow up: Not hearing from the doctor doesn't mean there is good news, always call for test results . ‘We’ve had this problem for a while,’ he told the site. ‘We just haven’t been able to measure it.’ Erika Hanson Brown, 70, was initially failed by her doctors when she had Stage 3C colorectal cancer 12 years ago. ‘It doesn’t surprise me. It horrifies me,’ she told NBC News. ‘When the doctor says ‘Oh, you’re fine,’ you believe him.’ Brown survived her bout with cancer and is now an advocate for colorectal cancer survivors. Singh believes that both doctors and patients are to blame for the errors. Some doctors may not be well-versed in the condition for which the patient is seeking treatment, but the patient may also not be able to effectively communicate their ailments, he argued in the study. Paper records, instead of digital ones with full family medical histories, also hinder proper diagnoses, Singh told Vox. Following up with doctors is also recommended by Singh as a way to cut down potential life threatening errors.","About five per cent of all medical diagnoses in the U.S. are erroneous, the study found .
The errors kill as many as 98,000 people per year ."
"By . Associated Press . A Canadian flight simulator business fired an instructor who figured prominently in CNN's coverage of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, saying he showed up late to his regular job and 'shamed Canadians' by dressing like a teenager. uFly company owner Claudio Teixeira said he fired Mitchell Casado on Wednesday in part for refusing to dress professionally and making Canadians 'look very bad all over the world.' Casado's relaxed style of jeans and plaid shirts attracted wide attention during CNN's constant coverage of the search for the missing flight. Fired: A Canadian flight simulator business fired instructor Mitchell Casado, pictured with his pet bunnies, who figured prominently in CNN's coverage of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, saying he showed up late to his regular job and 'shamed Canadians' by dressing like a teenager . CNN's Martin Savidge and Casado logged many hours reporting from the fake cockpit located at the company's office in near the Toronto airport, which has a simulator that is the same model of the lost plane. Teixeira said Casado didn't come to work Tuesday when customers had the simulator booked. 'This is not the first time. He's been warned before,' he told The Associated Press. Teixeira says he received many email complaints about the instructor's way of dressing during the time he appeared on CNN. 'Even though I let him be on TV he . shamed us Canadians and shamed my company with the way he was dressing . like he was 15 years old,' he said. 'People were complaining that it . wasn't professional at all ... If you go to any plane you don't see them . in shorts and sandals.' TV star: CNN's Martin Savidge and Casado, right, logged many hours reporting from the fake cockpit located at the company's office in near the Toronto airport, which has a simulator that is the same model of the lost plane . Casado declined to comment when reached by AP, saying 'I'm not interested in talking to you.' In a tweet earlier, Casado wrote 'My boss had me training a new guy the last few days, and now that he can do my job, and CNN left, he fired me. That's Ufly.' CNN spokeswoman Bridget Leininger noted Casado is an employee of uFLY, not CNN. She said CNN will not broadcast from the simulator on Thursday but may do so in the future. Savidge and Casado spent 12-to18-hour . days in the cockpit, using the machine to simulate what might happen . under certain scenarios. They logged so much airtime reporting from the . fake cockpit that the hashtag #freemartinsavidge appeared on Twitter. Upset: In a tweet earlier, Casado, seen left, wrote 'My boss had me training a new guy the last few days, and now that he can do my job, and CNN left, he fired me. That's Ufly' Although CNN has been criticized for its blanket coverage, its viewership rose 84 percent last month over what it had been before the plane went missing, the Nielsen company said. When the cameras were off, Savidge took some informal flying lessons from Casado. Teixeira called Casado a nice guy and wished him luck but said a change had to be made. 'I am the boss. I am the owner. I put in the money. It has to be my rules. If you don't agree with them you have to find another job,' he said. He said he gave Casado two-weeks pay.","uFly company owner Claudio Teixeira said he fired Mitchell Casado on Wednesday in part for refusing to dress professionally and making Canadians 'look very bad all over the world'

"By . Associated Press . Football players at Minnesota State, Mankato, refused to practice for their former head coach on Wednesday, greeting his reinstatement by an arbitrator after child porn allegations by demanding that the interim coach keep the top job. Todd Hoffner returned to campus for the first time since the arbitrator ruled he was fired unfairly last year in the wake of a child porn investigation that ultimately cleared him. Hoffner was arrested in 2012 over . images of his children on a university-issued cellphone. Todd Hoffner, former football coach at Minnesota State, Mankato, tears up as he talks about getting back to coaching football after being fired more than a year ago during a news conference Tuesday . Reinstated Minnesota State, Mankato football coach Todd Hoffner, foreground, listens to a statement read by football player Samuel Thompson calling for return of the interim coach as the rest of the team stands by Wednesday . Though he was . eventually cleared by a judge who described the images as innocent . pictures of children acting playful after a bath, the school . subsequently suspended, reassigned and fired him for reasons that . weren't made public at the time. Mavericks players came out for spring practice Wednesday afternoon but were not in uniform, The Free Press of Mankato reported. They read a statement saying they were unanimous in wanting Aaron Keen to remain as head coach. 'We've all become outstanding community members, students and athletes in the last year and a half since the removal of Todd Hoffner,' said the statement, which junior safety Sam Thompson read aloud. 'Throughout this process, we have been silent. It is time our voice is heard.' Thompson said the players 'want answers, because this is our team,' according to the MSU Reporter, a student publication. Minnesota State interim football coach Aaron Keen, left, shakes hands with reinstated coach Todd Hoffner before practice Wednesday . 'As a unit we have decided not to practice, because of the change-up in the coaching situation,' he said.

Athletic director Kevin Buisman said in a statement that players had 'shared their concerns.' He said a meeting was scheduled for Thursday between the players, Hoffner, Keen and the rest of the coaching staff. Under interim coach Keen, Minnesota State finished 11-1 and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Division II tournament. But they were also successful under Hoffner: 34-13 in his four seasons from 2008-12. Hoffner will return to his old job after an arbitrator ruled he was wrongfully terminated, saying the decision wasn't easy but that it would help him and his family heal . The arbitrator's report said Hoffner . was accused of viewing porn on his work computer and letting his wife . use the device, and neither charge was proven. Hoffner, . 47, accepted the head coaching job at Minot State University in . January, and the arbitrator's order that he be reinstated forced him to . choose. He said Tuesday he would go back to Mankato, saying it would 'help heal that injury.' His . supporters said the school overreacted in the wake of the sex abuse . scandal at Penn State, noting his high-profile arrest came just months . after retired Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was . convicted of child sex abuse. The university said in a statement Tuesday that it welcomed Hoffner back and also apologized to him. Earlier . Wednesday, Hoffner told the Free Press it felt refreshing to be back on . campus. He said he got a big hug from senior tight end Darius Claire as . he walked into the football offices before practice. 'That made me feel good.

"By . James Rush . Holly Morrison has been indicted by a grand jury on three counts of gross sexual assault and three misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child . A 34-year-old woman has been accused of allowing her boyfriend to sexually assault a developmentally disabled 14-year-old relative, it has been reported. Holly Morrison, of Westbrook, Maine, has been indicted by a grand jury on three counts of gross sexual assault and three misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child. She is accused of allowing Donald Cass, a former reserve police officer, to sexually assault the girl on at least three occasions last autumn, according to court records cited by the Portland Press Herald. Morrison, who has been released on a $500 . cash bail, is due to be arraigned in Cumberland County Unified Criminal . Court on June 5, the paper reported . Cass, 59, of Auburn, was sentenced in February to serve four years of an eight year prison sentence, with the remaining balance suspended for a four-year probation term, after he pleaded guilty to two counts of gross sexual assault. Police were alerted after the victim reportedly told friends and a Department of Health and Human Services worker in November last year that she had been sexually assaulted, the Bangor Daily News has reported. A report by Westbrook Detective Steve Crocker also claimed the victim told officials Morrison insisted she get into bed with the couple, according to the Portland Press Herald. Morrison allegedly told police she met Cass at a 'swingers' party, the Bangor Daily News reported. The married 59-year-old is then said to have visited her for five years without his wife knowing, according to court records. The news comes just over a week after reports of the separate and unrelated case of a convicted sex offender captured by New Jersey police after a two-decade manhunt. Morrison, who has been released on a $500 cash bail, is due to be arraigned in Cumberland County Unified Criminal Court on June 5 . A multi-state investigation and three-day stakeout ended the 23-year search for James Wade Barclay with his arrest on Saturday, April 5, the New Jersey State Police Department said. Barclay was arrested in 1989 and pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 10-year-old multiple times over a two-year period, but he never showed up for his sentencing hearing in September 1991. He had been on the run ever since. Police recently learned that Barclay had created a new identity, going by the alias James Toryone and working as a trucker throughout the United States, police said. The investigation led New Jersey police to stake out a 'Stop N Ride' parking lot in rural Pennsylvania for three days. Barclay was spotted inside a parked tractor trailer and arrested without incident.","Holly Morrison indicted by grand jury on three gross sexual assault counts .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman wearing an ‘abusive wife’ costume was arrested for beating up her boyfriend in Detroit, Michigan, on Saturday night. Cristina Crespo, 26, and her unnamed boyfriend were participating in a Halloween pub crawl when they were spotted by police outside the Mojave Cantina at around 9pm. Patrol officers stopped to check on Crespo, who was clearly intoxicated and lying on the sidewalk. Cristina Crespo, 26, was arrested for beating up her boyfriend in Detroit, Michigan, on Saturday night while dressed as an 'abusive wife' during a Halloween pub crawl . A friend managed to get Crespo on her feet and helped her inside the cantina, but the officers decided to follow to check on her welfare. Clawson Police Lt. Scott Sarvello said that the officer followed Crespo inside and found her ‘sitting outside behind the cantina.’ ‘She said they were there for a pub crawl and she was dressed up as an abusive wife,’ Sarvello told the Daily Tribune. The officer then tracked down Crespo's boyfriend, who was dressed up as an ‘abused husband’ which entailed a stream of fake blood running from his nose. The boyfriend confirmed to the officer that the couple had a designated driver, and he agreed to collect their things and leave. As the officer exited the cantina, he heard shouting and went to investigate. Crespo and her unnamed boyfriend were participating in a Halloween pub crawl when they were spotted by police outside the Mojave Cantina in Detroit at around 9pm . He found Crespo ‘screaming and repeatedly hitting the boyfriend with her purse’ and tried to intervene, but Crespo ‘continued to be loud and belligerent and was detained.’ ‘It’s ironic that she went out dressed up as an abuser and that’s what she ended up as,’ said Sarvello. Crespo had a blood-alcohol level of .19 – more than twice the .08 legal limit for driving in Michigan. She was booked on a charge of misdemeanor assault and battery but released a short time later after posting 10 percent of her $5,000 bond. Crespo is due back in court on November 6 and is prohibited from consuming alcohol or contacting her boyfriend in the meantime.","Cristina Crespo, 26, was arrested for beating up her boyfriend in Detroit, Michigan, during a Halloween pub crawl on Saturday night .

"By . Marie-louise Olson . Furious people took to Facebook to vent their anger over the recent profiling of shoppers in the New York retailer, Barneys. This comes as a fourth person has come forward with similar claims, this time against Macy's - the second in a week. Art Palmer says four plainclothes cops questioned him three blocks away from the flagship store after he bought $320 worth of Polo dress shirts and ties in April. The latest accusation echoes those by Trayon Christian and Kayla Phillips against Barneys and by actor Robert Brown against the same Macy’s. Shocking: Trayon Christian, 19, left, and Kayla Phillips, 21, claim they were interrogated by police after buying expensive items from Barneys . Palmer, a 56-year-old exercise trainer from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, said he made the purchase without incident, using both his Macy’s platinum card and his American Express card. He was walking to a gym on Park Avenue when police surrounded him and demanded to see his ID. The officers said they were suspicious because they had lost sight of him on the store’s surveillance cameras, he said. When asked if he believed he was racially profiled, he told the New York Daily News that there was 'no other reason'. He was allowed to continue on his way after he showed his receipt for the duds and the cards with which he purchased them. When Palmer returned to the store the next day to complain, a Macy’s manager blamed it on the cops and said officers frequently come into the store to monitor surveillance videos without permission, according to Palmer. Two black Barneys customers said this week they were detained by police after making expensive purchases, while last week actor Robert Brown said he was paraded through Macy’s Herald Square store in handcuffs and detained for an hour after being racially profiled and accused of using a stolen credit card to buy his mother a $1,350 watch.

"The note that Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev wrote on the wall of the boat where he was found after a massive manhunt has been released, showing the motivation behind the fatal attack. Stains of either red paint or blood are shown dripping down through the angry note and some words were blasted away by bullet holes. 'The U.S. government is killing our innocent civilians, but most of you already know that… I can’t stand to see such [bullet hole] go unpunished,' the hand-scribbled note obtained by ABC News says. Final words: Photos of the note that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev wrote inside a boat where he has captured have now been released showing what his thoughts were in the wake of the bombing that killed 3 and injured 260 . Censored by a bullet hole: Some of the words in the note are blocked out by bullet holes and either blood or paint . 'We Muslims are one body. You kill one of us, you hurt [bullet hole] us all.' Much more was included in the note but very little of it is legible. The note was written on the side of the wall of the boat in a backyard in Watertown, Massachusetts where Dzhokhar was found. Earlier reports noted that the phrase 'F*** America' was included somewhere but the photo released on Thursday did not show that portion. Dzhokhar, the now-20-year-old charged with helping his older brother Tamerlan set off two bombs at the finish line of the Boston Marathon last April, is currently awaiting trial and is being held in solitary confinement at a prison in Massachusetts. Under a spell: The denfense s planning on describing how Dzhokhar was under his brother's control when he participated in the dual bombing at the Boston Marathon in 2013 (pictured: then-19-year-old Dzhokhar being captured) ABC reports that his defense team did not have a comment about the note. Just yesterday, a judge ruled that Dzhokhar can be visited by his relatives without an FBI agent present. He had previously been watched during the visits, but his defense attorneys argued that there was no clear threat and the agent's presence prevented the family from speaking freely. 'This case is very much a story about a family and the relationships between them,' defense attorney David Bruck said in a court hearing on Wednesday. Family ties: Defense attorneys for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) argued that he did not need an agent present when he met with his sister in prison and they are trying to understand the relationship he had with his older, now-deceased brother Tamerlan (left) The judge agreed with the defense's point, pushing past the prosecution's suggestion that the minder was needed for security. 'I don’t think the safety, security issue looms very large,' US district judge George A. O'Toole Jr ruled. The Boston Globe reported that the decision will not be final until the US Bureau of Prisons weighs in, and that is expected to take about two weeks. The agent's presence is not only a question of security but could also have a role in the trial as it was earlier reported that during one of these visits, the agent allegedly heard Dzohkhar say something controversial in a heated exchange with his sister. 'Tsarnaev, despite the presence of an FBI agent and an employee of the federal public defender, was unable to temper his remarks and made a statement to his detriment which was overheard by the agent,' a late February court hearing stated. Prosecutors later said that the remark was 'the driving force' behind Tsarnaev's defense team's decision to push for a change in the visitation procedure. The strategy also suggests that the defense team is preparing to paint Dzhokhar, who was 19 at the time of last year's bombings, as under the mental control of his 26-year-old brother Tamerlan who was killed in a shoot out with police. Paying respects: The court decisions come just one day after the anniversary of the bombings (the Boylston Street finish line pictured on Tuesday during a memorial ceremony)","The note's message is broken up by bullet holes and 'blood stains'

"By . Scarlett Russell . Girls night out: Birthday girl Victoria Beckham pictured with friends on a night out in LA . Happy Birthday darling... what time will you be coming home then? A new poll has revealed that while romantic men are keen to spend birthdays with their other half, most women would rather celebrate another year passing on a night out with their gal pals. The survey, conducted by online gifting . website Findmeagift.co.uk, polled a total of 1,948 Britons, aged 18-40, . who are all either married or in a long term relationship (a year or . more) but who are yet to have any children. Just one . per cent of men opted to have a quiet birthday at home with their . friends, whilst 73 per cent chose quality time alone with their . significant other and just 22 per cent voted for a night out eating, . drinking or dancing with mates. Meanwhile, . an overwhelming number of female respondents – 51 per cent – said a . night out eating, drinking or dancing with friends was their ideal way . to spend a birthday. When asked whether they would want to have, ‘Quality time alone with a partner,’ just 38 per cent said yes. Four per cent of men and five per cent of women opted to be alone to have, ‘Time to relax’ on their birthday. Of the men who admitted to wanting to celebrate with just their partners, only 19 per cent said they’d tell their friends about their romantic plans prior to their birthday. And of the remaining 71 per cent of those who would lie to their friends, 67 per cent confessed that they would try to make time for both friends and their partners during their birthday, whilst 14 per cent would lie to friends and tell them their partner had already made plans that could not be cancelled. True romantics: 73 per cent of British men would choose to celebrate their birthday with their significant other, according to a new survey . A spokesman for Findmeagift.co.uk said: . ‘Our research suggests that men are perhaps more romantic than we . thought and, it would seem, girls just want to have fun. ‘The . amount of British men that admitted to feeling reluctant about exposing . their preferred celebration plans to their friends seems to show that, . rather than being scared of their wife or girlfriend’s wrath, it's . friends that men are most worried about letting down.' Respondents were also asked how they had spent the evening of their last birthday. 44 . per cent of all respondents spent the occasion indulging in some . quality time at home or in a hotel with their partner, whilst 32 per . cent enjoyed a night out with a group of friends. 9 per cent stated they spent their last birthday on holiday abroad.","Over half of British women want to celebrate their birthdays with friends .

"By . Bianca London . They first made an appearance at the Epsom Derby in June 2011 and then again at Prince Philip’s 90th birthday. We have seen them at Zara Phillips’s wedding and at the Queen's Coronation service last year. And now they have been spotted on the Royal tour down under as Kate, 32, chose her favourite £185 nude LK Bennett heels for a day of engagements in Sydney. It seems that the Duchess of Cambridge can't get enough of the 'go with everything heels'... and neither can we. Scroll down for video . She just can't get enough! The Duchess of Cambridge snapped up her LK Bennett nude court shoes three years ago but they're still a wardrobe staple, as she proves on her arrival in Sydney - and she's helping sales soar .

"By . Associated Press . and Meghan Keneally . The widow of a volunteer fire fighter who died in the blaze at a West, Texas fertilizer plant one year ago has opened up about how she went through her pregnancy alone. 'People would tell me how strong I was. I don’t really feel strong. I just had to go on because I had two kids and I was pregnant,' Becky Calvin said. Her husband Perry was a farmer who volunteered with fire departments in the nearby towns of Navarro Mills and Mertens, and their crews were called when the scale of the fire was fully realized. New life: Becky Calvin (left) gave birth to Presley Wreanne seven months after her husband Perry died in the blast, and she tries to keep his memory alive with their two sons Preston (center right) and Wyatt (right) Tragic: Her husband Perry Calvin was one of 12 volunteer fire fighters who died in the blaze at a West, Texas fertilizer plant on April 17 of last year . 'The pregnancy is probably more of what kept me going because I had to take care of the baby, so I had to eat and I had to sleep. Things that I didn’t want to do, I just knew I had to do because I didn’t have a choice,' Becky said to The Star-Telegram. She was about two months pregnant at the time of the April 17 explosion, and her husband was thrilled when they found out that they were expecting. The couple already had two sons and thought they were bound to have another boy. It was only after Perry's death that Becky learned that their third child was due to be a girl. 'When I found out, I was happy but it was very emotional. I knew he’d never get to see her. He really wanted a girl, so it was bittersweet,' she told the paper. Horrific: Stores of ammonium nitrate exploded in a gigantic blast that registered as a small earthquake and sprayed debris miles away (pictured at the time of the blast) The Calvin family has a tradition of . naming their children so they have 'p' and 'w' as initials, and Becky . told how one of her sons suggested the girl be named Presley but she . went with one that she and her husband had picked out for her middle . name- Wreanne- which the couple had picked as a female option for their . first two children. Bad feeling: Becky Calvin says that she feared that something had happened to Perry when he didn't respond to her text . 'She has eyes like mine and a complexion like mine, but I think she has his lips and she’s tall,' Becky said. 'I hate that he’s not here, especially with her being a girl, to enjoy her but it was special to have another part of him.' Perry Calvin, 37, was just one of the volunteer firefighters who raced to protect families and elderly residents who lived near the fertilizer plant that fateful night. Stores of ammonium nitrate exploded in a gigantic blast that registered as a small earthquake and sprayed debris miles away. Fifteen people were killed, including 12 volunteer firefighters and others responding to the fire, and more than 200 were injured. The blast caved in homes and schools, and destroyed water lines and roads. In the weeks and months after the explosion, residents and city officials talked about how to persevere — to ""Keep West West."" The signs of physical progress are obvious: Gone are the dozens of wrecked homes with tongue-in-cheek 'For Sale!' messages spray-painted on their walls, and about 70 homes are finished or in the process of construction. Two new schools and a nursing home to replace those destroyed by the explosion will soon give displaced students and elderly residents a better sense of normalcy. Payments from the city's long-term recovery fund, which received about $3.6million in donations, have been delayed as organizers deal with unforeseen paperwork and federal regulations. What remains: This photo was taken on Tuesday, just two days before the one year anniversary of the blast and shows how the reconstruction process is far from over . The city's go-to person for that sort of work, City Secretary Joey Pustejovsky, was a volunteer firefighter who died in the blast. West Mayor Tommy Muska said he's closely watching the emotional toll the blast has taken on the city's 2,800 residents, especially victims who are still recovering. 'A lot of them have suffered some type of post-traumatic stress of some sort,' Muska said. 'I am definitely concerned. We are not going to lose sight of that.' Holly . Harris' husband, Dallas Fire-Rescue Captain Kenneth Luckey Harris, . rushed to save other first responders when he saw smoke at the plant. When she didn't immediately hear from him, she sensed he may have died. Becky Calvin had a similar unnerving feeling. 'I immediately got worried because I knew Perry was over there,' she told the Star-Telegram. Remembrance: The town has tried to 'Keep West West' but for so many, like the Calvins, that is a difficult task . 'I . felt different. I knew something was wrong because he always, even if . he didn’t have time to talk or anything, if I sent him a text, he would . just send one back, saying ""OK"" or ""I’m OK"" just so I wouldn’t worry... I . couldn’t even get that, so I knew it was more than just him being . busy.' Mrs Harris remains in . their home outside West, where the fence now has a metal shield with . her husband's initials above a fireman's hat. One of her sons remains a . Dallas firefighter, and another has since signed up. Harris . and others say they've chosen to push forward and not dwell on . unanswered questions, such as what sparked the fire or what firefighters . knew going in — or what could have been done to prevent it. 'It's just a choice that we've made that we're not going to be sad,' she said. 'I mean, we are sad at times, but we're going to try to make everything a happy situation and try to get on with our lives.'","Becky Calvin learned that she was pregnant with her third child just weeks before her husband Perry was killed in a fertilizer plant blast .

"By . Peter Rugg . A pair of high school students on Long Island have been suspended indefinitely after bringing a Confederate flag to school. The two seniors at St. Anthony's High School in South Huntington came to school wearing the flag over their shoulders at an after-hours sporting event, said the school's principal, Brother Gary Cregan. 'The African-American students who immediately saw it really exercised heroic restraint and fortunately a teacher immediately confiscated the flag and took the students out of the gym,' he told CBS New York. Two students have been permanently suspended for wearing a Confederate flag to school . While Cregan initially suspended them for 10 days he has since changed his mind to make the punishment indefinite. Cregan wrote a letter to the unnamed student's parents saying that any symbol 'designed to revive past injustices or to inflame discrimination or racial intolerance, is completely unacceptable and profoundly offensive,' according to Newsday. He called the flag a symbol of hate. 'I find it just very hard to even imagine why any student in 2014 would even consider or think that a Confederate flag would be anything other than a symbol of hate,' he said. Student Jessica Flynn agreed. 'It's absolutely absurd,' she said. 'I don't understand why you would bring up things from the past that are hateful.' The sentiment was echoed by parent JuJu Quinnonez. Brother Gary Cregan said he considered the flag hate speech . 'It represents slavery to us,' she said. 'It represents racism and prejudice to us. Believe me, I am all for freedom of speech but to have someone come in to school with that flag draped around their shoulder -- I'm not really sure what the intent was.' Cregan said hate speech would not be protected by freedom of speech. 'I certainly think this particular symbol of hate falls in the category of something that should be excised from our culture,' he said. As St. Anthony's is a private Catholic school it is not bound by First Amendment rights. While the suspension was initially only set for ten days, Cregan said tensions in the school were so high it was best they not return at all . The students have not explained their intent. However, they still have the backing of the New York Civil Liberties Union. 'Our motto is more speech, not censorship or punishment,' said NYCLU director Donna Lieberman. 'Helping children understand the impact of this patently expressive activity.' But with tensions running high and the principal having security concerns about a return, he said they won't be coming back at all if he has his way.","Unnamed teens wore flag at after-hours sporting event .

"By . Associated Press . and Ashley Collman . A former radiology technician whose 'disinterest in her job' caused 10 patients to receive false negative mammograms was sentenced Tuesday to six months in prison and a decade of probation. Rachel Rapraeger of Macon, Georgia told authorities that she had 'personal issues that caused her to be disinterested in her job' and that caused a backlog in her work. To catch up, she entered more than 1,200 clean test results, even though a doctor never looked at the scans. Of those total 1,289 women screened for breast cancer at Perry Hospital, 10 actually had the deadly disease and were never informed. Two of those 10 victims have since died. Scroll down for video . Playing Russian Roulette: Ex-radiology technician Rachel Rapraeger, 33 (pictured), was sentenced to six months in prison and a decade of probation Tuesday after giving out more then 1,200 clean mammogram results without a doctor's review . On Tuesday, Rapraeger agreed to a plea deal which includes six months in prison, ten years of probation, a $12,5000 fine and she won't be able to work in the health field for a decade. Judge Katherine Lumsden adressed several of the victims seated in the front row of court on Tuesday, saying there was no sentence that would fix what Rapraeger did. 'You played Russian roulette with the lives of essentially a thousand women in this community,' Judge Lumsden then told Rapraeger. Some of the victims were also given the opportunity to address Raraeger in court. Sharon Holmes was one of the victims who chose to spoke. She received a negative test result in December 2009 but then found out two months later that she had breast cancer and it had already spread to her lymph nodes. Victims: Of the more than 1,200 clean results Rapraeger gave out, 10 patients actually had breast cancer and didn't know it. Some of the victims attended her sentencing on Tuesday and sat in the front row . Sharon Holmes was one of the victims to address Rapraeger in court Tuesday. Ms Holmes received a flase negative mammogram in December 2009, but found out just a few months later that she had breast cancer and that the disease had already spread to her lymph nodes . 'You could have made a different decision and my family and I would not be living this nightmare,' Ms Holmes said. Ms Holmes says it took courage to address Rapraeger, but she wanted to make sure her story was heard and she wasn't just another number. 'I'm not a name on a piece of paper, I'm a person, and I think she will remember me.' Ms Holmes told WMAZ. Two of the victims ended up dying of breast cancer before they could see Rapraeger behind bars. Pictured above is Miriam Mizell who died in January 2012 in a photo posted on Facebook . Ms Holmes considers herself a survivor and has been in remission for three years, but is still not pleased with Tuesday's decision. 'If I'm living a sentence for having cancer then you should live a sentence behind bars,' Ms Holmes said. Two victims were not as lucky as Holmes and died after getting their false negatives. One of those victims was Miriam Mizell who died of breast cancer at the age of 63 in January 2012. In a September 2010 interview with WMAZ, she said her mammogram came back clean in 2008 and two years later she received an offer of a free mammogram. She took up the offer and the test came back positive . 'I was lied to from the beginning,' Ms Mizell then said. Rapraeger's attorney explained that his client entered the false negatives because she was overwhelmed and overworked. 'She had too much work, and she was getting behind. She wanted to keep up,' attorney Floyd Buford said. Rapraeger's . attorney said part of the reason his client decided to take the plea . deal was that the prosecution didn't have enough evidence to convict her . since the hospital had destroyed her computer and hard drive. Rapraeger . was not taken into custody Tuesday, and remains free on $50,000 bail . while she waits for a bed to open up at a probation detention center. 'I . think it's a fair sentence based on what happened and based on her . cooperation in this case,' said Daniel Bibler, the deputy chief . assistant district attorney. Mr Buford added , 'She's going to be paying a price, but even without that she's very remorseful.'

"By . Lydia Warren . Arrest: Randy Johnson, 51, allegedly kidnapped and sexually assaulted a teenage girl . A 51-year-old man who allegedly kidnapped a 14-year-old girl with Down syndrome has now been charged with sexual assault. Randy Johnson was arrested at a trailer park in Harlingen, Texas on Wednesday morning after the girl vanished from her family's home 350 miles away in Magnolia on Monday. Her family is now traveling south to meet the girl, who was taken to hospital after the arrest. Her mental disabilities cause . her to act like a five or six year old, her family previously said. 'She is fine, she is a little scared, because no one is with her,' her father told KHOU. 'They asked us if we can head down there to pick her up.' Her mother added: 'I just want to hug her. That's it. I just want to wrap her in my arms and hug her and not let her ever go.' The girl, whom MailOnline is not naming because she is the alleged victim of a sexual assault, has Down Syndrome, autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD). Police had issued an Amber Alert earlier this week after the teenager vanished on Monday and authorities were able to track Johnson down using his cell phone. Victim: The girl, pictured left and right with her mother, was rescued and is now being met by her family . Johnson, who had worked with the victim's father, moved into her family's home after suffering from colon cancer. But after eight months, they kicked him out for getting 'too close' to their daughter. 'We were literally listening to every conversation, and it was in code,' her mother said. 'So once we decided what the codes were, it was like, you have to go, you can't be here.' On Monday, she went outside to check the mail but never came home, and witnesses said they had last seen her by the mailbox on a cell phone. The teenager's aunt said that she had recently taken a cell phone from the girl, so Johnson must have given her another one. After she disappeared, her parents said they received a call from Johnson. Scene: She vanished from outside her family's trailer park home, pictured, on Monday, her parents said . 'He . calls us and says, ""Y'all will never see her again"" and . things like that,' her father said. '""Where we're going you . can't get there"". Not even ten minutes later he calls back and goes, . ""La-la-la-la"".' The parents . added that Johnson claimed he was going to be passing through a . checkpoint, but pointed out that the family had no IDs to be able to do . the same. Johnson was at the Cameron County Jail on Wednesday, being held on kidnapping charges and aggravated sexual assault of a child. He is expected to be . extradited to Montgomery to face official charges.","The teenager vanished from outside her family's home in Magnolia, Texas on Monday and was found 350 miles away on Wednesday .

"By . Associated Press . Nancy Pfister, 57, died from a blunt force injury to the head at her home in Aspen, a coroner said on Wednesday . A socialite who was found dead in her home in Aspen was killed by a blunt force injury to her head, the Pitkin County coroner said on Wednesday. Nancy Pfister, 57, was hit with a hard object that had a small, curved shape. She had been dead about 36 hours before her body was found on February 26, coroner J. Steven Ayers said. Prosecutors have filed first-degree murder charges against three people, including a couple who had rented Pfister's home while she was in Australia. William Styler III, 65, and his wife, Nancy Styler, 62, were arrested on March 3 after moving out of the home on about February 22. Katherine Carpenter, 56, an assistant to Pfister and a bank employee, was arrested on March 14. Authorities said she called 911 to report she found Pfister's body in a closet of the home. Investigators have been tight-lipped about the case, and key court documents have been sealed. Ayers said his office wasn't covered by the court order sealing the files. His report contains some of the only details about the case to be made public. Prosecutors have filed a motion to unseal other documents, saying no more arrests are expected so there is no longer a reason to keep the files closed. Some media organizations have also asked the court to release the documents. William Styler III, 65, and his wife, Nancy Styler, 62, were arrested on March 3 after moving out of the home on about February 22 . Defense attorneys have told the judge they oppose the release. Pfister . was the daughter of the late Betty and Art Pfister, longtime prominent . Aspen residents who co-founded the Buttermilk ski area west of town. Buttermilk Mountain has hosted the Winter X Games multiple times. Pfister's death was the first homicide case in Pitkin County in 12 years, not counting those classified as murder-suicides. The Stylers and Carpenter are being held without bond. They are scheduled to return to court April 23. Pfister wrote on Facebook on February 3 . that 'the people that were supposedly taking care of my house are not . doing what they said they would do and they're not paying rent and they . haven't paid utilities'. Over the years Pfister had paid . Carpenter, an employee at two Apline bank branches in Aspen, to manage . her property and to walk her dog, Gabe, who came with the $4,000-a-month . lease. On February 6, . Pfister posted on Facebook that she was looking for new tenants and that . anyone interested should contact Carpenter. She subsequently returned from Australia and, days later, was found dead by Carpenter. Katherine Carpenter, 56, an assistant to Pfister and a bank employee, was arrested on March 14. Authorities said she called 911 to report she found Pfister's body in a closet of the home . Juliana Pfister attended those . proceedings surrounded by friends, telling ABC News that she couldn't . believe someone would kill her fun-loving mother because of an alleged . rent dispute. 'How could someone just be so angry that they got kicked out of a house?' she said. 'There's got to be something more. It's hard to understand that.' Investigators spent weeks at Pfister's house, which remained an active crime, removing many boxes and files as evidence. County Sheriff Joe DiSalvo has released few details about the resort town's first murder investigation since 2001. 'This is a very important case,' he said. 'It just doesn't happen in Aspen.' Ms Pfister, pictured left with her daughter Juliana, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent .","Nancy Pfister, 57, was hit with a hard .

"By . Lydia Warren . Larry Carroll and his daughter Savannah had always loved to sneak what they called 'stolen moments' - whether it was an unplanned trip to the playground or splitting a big chocolate cookie. And when his 'Savvy' passed away unexpectedly and inexplicably on April 4, he realized how crucial these moments had been, and how he wanted another little girl to be as happy as she had been. As Carroll, a writer and producer in Los Angeles, awaits blood tests that he hopes will shed some light on the cause of her death, he has decided to launch 'Savannah's Stolen Moments' - a fundraising campaign to pay for a hard-up family to give their own little girl a treat. His initial aim of $10,000 has been far surpassed and people who have been touched by his heartbreaking story have donated more than $48,000. Missed: Larry Carroll has set up a fundraising campaign in the memory of his daughter, Savannah . 'All I wanted to do was show my wife there was a reason to go on, that there was joy in the world and, even in the most brutal moments, the world is still a beautiful place with amazing people,' Carroll told Today, as he recounted his thoughts the first night after Savannah's death. He hoped that the fundraising website would raise $10,000 that he and his wife Carrie would then gift to a family who wanted to treat their own daughter, but who could not necessarily afford it. 'I'm feeling very powerless right now,' Carroll wrote on the website. 'The only way I can handle this powerlessness, I figure, is with the power to give someone else joy.' With the donations continuing to grow, the couple has not yet decided who will get the money. 'The only 3 . requirements are that they have a little girl, that they very clearly . love her, and that they don't have the financial means to typically do . this sort of thing,' he wrote on the site. Adorable: The little girl, known as 'Savvy', did not wake up on April 4 and her family still does not know why . Missed: Carroll (with Savvy, his wife and son) said he had loved his 'stolen moments' of joy with his daughter . The donations beyond $10,000 will go towards a college fund for the girl, he told Today. 'We're going to sit in a mall, a . coffee shop, a restaurant or playground watch people a little while . until we find a girl that reminds us of Savannah,' Carroll said. He also said he would love to meet up the little girl and her family after they go on their adventure so that he can see their photographs and hear their stories. 'Let us live vicariously through their joy and know that if Savannah had lived to that age, maybe we would have had that moment with her,' Carroll said. Carroll and wife Carrie, who is . eight-and-a-half months pregnant, said they are hoping to be able to . find a girl when they come more to terms with their grief, perhaps later . in the summer. Loved: He now hopes the fundraiser can allow another family to share a happy moment with their child . Happy memories: The parents are pictured together with Savannah on the day she was born . But for now, they are overjoyed with the messages that are flooding in for them over Twitter as parents share moments of joy with their own children and use the hashtag #StolenMoments. 'I will find a family somewhere - someone I . have never met before and has no connection to anyone I know - and help . them make a Stolen Moment,' Carroll wrote on the website. 'In the wake of this tragedy, I'm determined to create joy.'

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The Utah woman accused of concealing seven pregnancies before strangling or suffocating her newborns also hid her growing belly when she was carrying her two eldest daughters, now in their early 20s, authorities revealed Wednesday. Investigators say they already have an initial theory as to why Megan Huntsman would have killed six of her babies, but aren't discussing it publicly Pleasant Grove Police Capt Mike Roberts said. Roberts revealed Wednesday that family didn't know Huntsman was pregnant with her two oldest children until the moment she went into labor at the hospital. Neighbors have said they never knew she was pregnant, . though they now remember weight fluctuations and toggling between baggy . and tight clothes. 'So, she apparently knows how to do it,' Roberts said. Home delivery: On Wednesday, it was revealed that Megan Huntsman gave birth to all six of the babies she's accused of murdering at home, and not a hospital . Investigators have determined that Huntsman, 39, did not got to the hospital to have the babies, but instead gave birth at home.  Roberts didn't say if anybody . helped her give birth. After . her estranged husband discovered one of the infant corpses in the . garage this past weekend, Huntsman acknowledged to police that she . killed six of the babies, put them in plastic bags and then packed them . inside boxes in the garage of her home south of Salt Lake City over a . decade from 1996 to 2006. She told police one of the babies was . stillborn. Huntsman was arrested Sunday on six counts of murder. She is being held on $6 million bail â€” $1 million for each baby â€” and is due in court Monday for an arraignment. Her husband, Darren West, told police in his initial interview that he knew nothing about the pregnancies, Roberts said. He has since obtained an attorney and investigators haven't spoken with him again, Roberts said. They are trying to determine his knowledge or involvement. Hiding it: Huntsman and her estranged husband Darren West have three daughters together, a teenager (center) and two in their early 20s. Family members allegedly didn't know she was pregnant with the two oldest girls until she went into labor at the hospital . Dad? Huntsman claims that all of the babies were born between 1996 and 2006 and that her estranged husband Darren West (pictured) is the father. West has denied paternity, and police are currently conducting a DNA test . If Huntsman's timeline is accurate, that would mean West was living with Huntsman during the time of the births. He went to federal prison in 2006 after pleading guilty to possessing chemicals intended to be used in manufacturing methamphetamine. West was released from a federal prison in California in January and transferred to a halfway house in Salt Lake City. Through a family spokesman, West has declined comment. The West family has said in a statement released Sunday that they are in a ""state of shock and confusion"" and that they're mourning ""this tragic loss of life."" Utah investigators are examining DNA from the babies to determine who the parents are, studying the bones to find out how long ago the babies died and have questioned family members and neighbors in pursuit of clues about how she did it. They are trying to determine why she did it and who else, if anybody, knew about it or was involved. Gruesome discovery: Huntsman was arrested after West found a stillborn baby in a box in his parents house on Saturday (pictured above). A subsequent police search discovered six more murdered newborns in boxes . They have not ruled out making more arrests. On Tuesday, they served a new search warrant at the house of a family member, Roberts said, but that turned up nothing useful. He said investigators are poring over evidence to find out if Huntsman gave birth and killed any other babies, but they don't believe that to be the case, he said.","Pleasant Grove, Utah mom Megan Huntsman, 39, was arrested Sunday and charged with murdering six of her newborn babies .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A two-alarm fire sparked by a lightning strike Tuesday ravaged an apartment complex in Celebration, Florida, forcing a cat to jump from a third-story window. Josue Alicea's pet named Charlie Jasper was caught on camera standing on a window sill before trying to make her way down the sheer wall. Having failed that, the one-year-old cat took a leap. She landed on the cement floor and took off running. Scroll down for video . Leap of faith: A video camera caught the moment a cat jumped out of a third-floor window to escape a two-alarm apartment building fire in Celebration, Florida . Nine lives: The animal landed on the cement floor and ran away before a first responder caught up with her and put an oxygen mask on her face . ‘It didn’t bounce or anything,’ fire victim Jim Cooke told the station WFTV of his neighbor’s pet. Eyewitnesses said Charlie Jasper was given an oxygen mask by responding firefighters, who spotted the cat a short distance away. Charlie Jasper was said to be purring when a first responder picked her up and handed the feline back to Alicea. According to her owner, the kitty escaped with burnt paws, a broken jaw and a few minor scrapes, the channel WKMG reported. Charlie Jasper is naturally grey, but in the video showing her daring escape the kitty appears jet-black from soot. Officials said a lightning bolt struck the attic of the 24-unit Evander Sqaure Apartments complex on Latte Drive at around 3pm Tuesday during a massive storm that rolled through the area. Lucky escape: Cat owner Josue Alicea said the one-year-old feline escaped the ordeal with burnt paws, a broken jaws and a few scrapes . Force of nature: The fire at Evander Sqaure Apartments complex was sparked by a lightning bolt, which struck the roof during a massive storm . Irreparable damage: The two-alarm fire ravaged the wooden building, the interior of which collapsed down to the first floor . About 20 minutes later a fire ignited, with 50mph gusts of wind spreading the flames, which quickly engulfed the whole interior of the wooden three-story building. All the tenants escaped the inferno unharmed. Like many of the residents, the cat's owner, Alicea, was at work when the fire sparked. It took Osceola County firefighters two hours to extinguish the blaze, but not before the roof collapsed all the way down to the first floor. Outcome: It took firefighters two hours to put out the flames, but despite their best efforts, all 24 families residing in the complex were left homeless . ‘Everything internal has collapsed to the bottom floor. I don't see a whole lot of salvageable things here,’ Deputy Fire Chief Danny McAvoy told WESH-TV. The tenants had moved into the building only five months ago. Now, most of them have been left with nothing. The American Red Cross is helping the 24 families who have been displaced by the fire.","Josue Alicea's one-year-old cat named Charlie Jasper escaped with burnt paws, injured jaw and bruises .

"By . Scarlett Russell . The Czech Republic has long been regarded as one of the most popular destinations for British men's stag parties: At one point, it was reported that 20 per cent of all weekend crime in Prague was caused by them. Perhaps one reason so many tourists flock to the Czech Republic is because of its relaxed attitude to sex, affairs and alcohol. The country has been deemed the most accepting of moral issues in the world, closely followed - bizarrely - by Japan. Cheers! Prague is one of the world's most popular destinations for stag parties, one pictured here. In a recent survey entitled Global Views of Morality, the Czech Republic was the most accepting of affairs, alcohol and sex . According to The Pew Research Center’s 2013 Global . Attitudes Project, Europe, Japan and countries within South . America are the most tolerant to premarital sex, with the Czech Republic coming out on top. 67 per cent of those questioned in the . survey from the country said they were accepting, compared to 59 per . cent in Greece, 57 per cent in Germany, 42 per cent in Italy and 38 . percent in Britain. Britain is amongst one of the most relaxed attitudes in Europe towards sex before marriage, but one of the most disapproving of extramarital affairs. French kiss: France was the second most accepting country when questioned about extramarital affairs in a recent morality survey. French President Francois Hollande, pictured here, famously had an affair . Just four per cent of British respondents deemed them acceptable, along with Australia and Canada. 17 per cent is the figure for the Czech Republic, the highest of all the countries when asked whether affairs were acceptable. It is followed closely by France, where the figure was 12 per cent. Outside of Europe, Venezuela is the most relaxed in terms of premarital sex, with 61 per cent believing it is acceptable. The Pew Research Center’s survey asked 40,117 respondents in 40 countries what they thought about eight topics often discussed as moral issues: extramarital affairs, gambling, homosexuality, abortion, premarital sex, alcohol consumption, divorce, and the use of contraceptives. They were asked to rate each topic as morally acceptable, unacceptable, or not a moral issue. Overall, whilst the Czech Republic is the most morally relaxed, according to the results Japan follows closely behind. 66 per cent of the country are accepting of alcohol use, 55 per cent accepting of divorce, 47 per cent of premarital sex and 44 per cent accepting of abortion, a figure even higher than in the US, where just 17 per cent think abortion is OK. The US are also more morally opposed to homosexuality than Japan. Just 23 per cent of those questioned think being gay is acceptable. In Japan the figure is 38 per cent, Brazil 44 per cent, Spain 55 per cent and Czech Republic comes out on top again, with 56 per cent. Those most unaccepting of homosexuality is Ghana, Pakistan, Egypt, Uganda and Nigeria, where the figure is just one per cent.","Respondents all over the world were asked about eight moral issues .

"By . Jonathan Block . On Tuesday, the FBI released a warning, titled 'Advice for U.S. students studying abroad: Be Aware of Foreign Intelligence Threat.' On the webpage containing the advice is included an FBI-produced video called 'Game of Pawns' The video as well as the FBI's new effort are in response ot the case of Glenn Duffie Shriver, a college student from Michigan who had studied in China. While there, he was courted by Chinese intelligence officers to provide national defense information to them. He received a total of $70,000 from 2005 through 2010 for his efforts. Scroll down for video . In the FBI-produced video 'Game of Pawns,' an American student is given an envelope with a wad of cash from a Chinese official . In an effort to hide bundles of cash before going out, the student wraps the money around his torso in 'Game of Pawns' In 2011, Shriver was sentenced to federal prison for four years for attempting to provide sensitive information to the Chinese. 'Game of Pawns' is a nearly 30-minute dramatic retelling of Shriver's story. In it, he is seen in Shanghai, excited to be studying abroad. He responds to a job ad to write political papers in a seemingly innocent job, but which is really a ploy to get him to engage in more sinister activities. Later, he is seen meeting with a Chinese woman who then introduces him to a Chinese man, and Shriver ends up finding the allure of tens of thousands of dollars to spy for the chinese government an offer too good to pass up. Glenn Duffie Shriver, the former Michigan college student who pled guilty in 2011 to charges he attempted to spy for the Chinese government while studying in Shanghai. He is serving a four-year sentence in a U.S. federal prison . More than 280,000 American college students studied abroad last year, according to the Institute of International Education. The experience provides them with cultural opportunities, as well as langugage and leadership skills that make them more appealing to both the private sector and the U.S. government. 'But this same marketability makes these students tempting and vulnerable targets for recruitment by foreign intelligence officers whose long-term goal is to gain access to sensitive or classified U.S. information,' the FBI says. The FBI warns that foreign intelligence officers would never claim they work as such when approaching a student. Rather, they first develop are relationship under seemingly harmless pretexts, such as an internship, writing assignments or cultural immersion program. As the relationship grows, the officer may then ask to provide information, in exchange for money or another type of reward, with the demands growing over time. They also suggest that the student apply for U.S. government jobs when they graduate from college. And that's exactly what happened to Shriver. After writing papers, the woman invited the man to meet some of her associates. That was when they suggested to have a 'friendship' and Shriver start applying for jobs with the federal government in the U.S. Shriver ended up applying for jobs at the State Department and the CIA, the latter as a clandestine service officer. He eventually realized the associates were members of the Chinese intelligence service, but that doesn't stop Shriver from applying. A federal agent prepares to arrest college student Glenn Duffie Shriver (played by actor) in the FBI-produced short film 'Game of Pawns' The FBI advises students to avoid 'money-for-nothing' offers, as well those that seem too good to be true. In addition, students should be skeptical of free favors, such as obtaining visa and work visas while abroad. In addition, the FBI suggests students minimize information about themselves through social media and not engage in contact with people who are involved with the foreign government or might be involved in criminal activities. 'A keen awareness is the most powerful weapon [against being recruited],' Shriver warns students.","Effort spurred due to the case of Glenn Duffie Shriver, who attempted to give the Chinese government classified information while he studied in Shanghai .

"By . Lydia Warren . Two cousins who kidnapped a four-year-old boy from a park as parents looked on in horror have sparked outrage after admitting the incident was fake. Jason Holden, 24, and his cousin Jesse said that they had coordinated the hoax in Sequim, Washington on Saturday afternoon with his stepmother, who allowed them to kidnap her son. The men called the police ahead of the stunt to warn them that they were filming a YouTube video to promote 'kidnapping awareness'. 'The police never said it wasn't a good . idea,' Holden told ABC News. 'They asked for our name and number and said they . would notify the police in our area.' Scroll down for video . Set up: A video posted to YouTube shows a man running from a van into a park and grabbing a four-year-old boy. The two cousins behind the video caused outrage after admitting that it was set up . Taken: He jumps into a waiting van with the young boy and they drive off - to the horror of witnesses . But authorities said they did not consider the phone call sufficient warning. The video, which was posted to their YouTube channel, shows the men donning masks as they drive towards the park while heavy guitar music plays. They pull alongside the park as the boy sits on the bench before one jumps out, runs towards him and picks him up - before returning to the van just seconds later. Panicked parents scream and run after the boy as they frantically try to take note of the van's license plate number. Afterwards . they returned to the park to explained to the worried parents what they . had been doing and to assure them the boy was safe - but they were met . with anger. 'We explained that we were filming an . awareness video for kidnapping, but everyone sat there and yelled at . us,' said Holden. 'We werenâ€™t able to explain ourselves or apologize.' Snatched: As parents run towards the car, the fake kidnappers, Jason and Jesse Holden, drive off . Anger: When they returned to the park, they were met with the terrified and angry parents . In trouble: They were later pulled over by a police officer who said he had been ready to shoot them . Mother Tiffany Barnett said that the explanation wasn't enough, saying: 'My daughter is still terrified. She's like, ""What if they take me?""' Police also pulled over the van after some of the parents placed 911 calls and the video shows their interaction with the police officer. 'Honestly, I was fully ready to kill whoever was in the front seat of that van,' he tells the men. They . explained that they had called police ahead of the incident but the . police officer apparently had not been warned. They apologized and the . police officer shook their hand and left. But it may not be over for the Holden cousins, as they could be charged with misdemeanor dangerous conduct or with failing to obtain a permit, City Attorney Craig Ritchie said. No decision had been reached as of Wednesday on whether to file charges, said Victoria Ormand, assistant to Police Chief Bill Dickinson. Regrets: The Holdens said they felt ashamed of scaring the parents but insisted they had good intentions . Remorse: They said the video, which had been to raise awareness of the crime, was now hard to watch . Speaking on Good Morning America on Thursday, Jesse Holden added that it was tough for him to watch the video, knowing how upset it had made people. 'It's kind of hard for me to watch it,' he said. 'I feel a lot of shame... We really didn't picture it was going to have that sort of impact.' The Sequim Police Department said they did receive a call from one of the men ahead of the hoax but that it was not the appropriate way to deal with the situation. 'We got a . call moments before the incident happened at the park, with someone . saying something to the effect of they are going to be filming a . documentary-type video involving a fake kidnapping,' Sgt. Detective Sean . Madison told ABC News. 'We don't consider that to be a warning or an . advisement.' Anger: Mother Tiffany Barnett said that her daughter was still scared she would be kidnapped . Sequim Police Chief Bill Dickinson added to KOMO that people had good reason to be upset. 'People are angry when they are taken advantage of,' Dickinson said. 'When they are the butt of the joke, it's never funny.' The video, which has been viewed more than 45,000 times, has had mixed responses, with many lambasting the thoughtlessness of the men, but others have supported it. 'Thank you guys,' one wrote. 'As a father of 3 I am glad that the people that watch this video will understand how easy it would be to just pull up and grab a kid from anywhere.'","Jason and Jesse Holden staged a kidnapping of a relative's child in Washington, claiming they wanted to raise awareness of the crime .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Twin boys who were joined at the abdomen when they were born have finally left a Texas hospital today eight months after a complicated operation to separate them. The playful brothers have made amazing progress since surgeons separated them when they were only one-month-old, but they won't be able to go home just yet. For now, Owen and Emmett Ezell will continue their treatment at a rehabilitation center until their little bodies have fully recovered from the complicated surgery used to separate them. Scroll down for video . Moving day: Owen and Emmett Ezell are finally leaving hospital eight months after they were separated . Going places: One of the twins, who were joined at the abdomen when born, is wheeled out of hospital . While their parents long for them to be able to come home, this latest baby step towards their recovery is an important milestone for the twins. When they were born in July last year, doctors were unsure if the boys, who shared intestines and a liver, would survive. At just one-month-old, the twins underwent a nine-hour operation to separate them. But, as they finally left the Medical City Children's Hospital for the first time since their birth, the doctors who cared for them were delighted at their progress. 'You can never predict what can happen but these little guys are definitely survivors,' Dr Tom Renard, the lead separation surgeon, told ABC News. Struggle: The twins were joined at the abdomen and shared intestines and a liver . Growing up: Despite undergoing a massive operation, the twins are curious and happy babies . Curious: The twins' mother says they like to play and wave at the nurses who have been caring for them . His thoughts were echoed by the twins' parents Jenni and David Ezell, who said they felt 'relief, joy and elation' that their boys were leaving hospital. In their blog about the twins, the Ezells wrote yesterday of their excitement at the babies being allowed to leave. 'I can hardly believe it, but it is true - the babies are being discharged,' the post read yesterday. 'We are very excited, and maybe even a little nervous, but wowie! Definitely thrilled beyond description.' The family added that the twins' older brothers Ethan and Liam were also looking forward to the day their siblings will come home. The next stage in Owen and Emmett's healing process will focus as much on teaching mom and dad how to care for the twins, as it will on making sure the boys continue to be happy and healthy. Relief: Parents Jenni and David Ezell are delighted that their boys are finally healthy enough to leave hospital . Survivors: Emmett and Owen Ezell pictured shortly after they were born in July last year . Surgery: The brothers had an operation to separate them when they were one-month-old . Homeward bound: It will be a few more weeks before the brothers finally go home, but their parents are delighted they are leaving hospital . 'Iâ€™ll finally have my family together . but we are about to face some serious challenges,' Mr Ezell said. 'The really . frightening life-or-death stuff is behind us but now we worry how about . how we are going to pull the rest of it off.' While Own and Emmett are in the rehabilitation center, their parents will be taught how to manage  feeding tubes and a home ventilator, as well as learning how to carry out rehabilitation exercises. Mrs Ezell said although it would be a daunting few months, she was looking forward to being able to finally care for her babies herself. She said that despite the physical obstacles her sons have had to overcome, they acted like regular babies. Holiday spirit: The brothers spent Christmas in the hospital, but that didn't dampen their moods . Family: The twins are pictured with mom Jenni and big brother Ethan . They are 'very interactive, very social little boys,' she told AZ Central, adding: 'They flirt with all of the girls that come in, flash smiles and wave.' Dr Clair Schwendeman agreed, adding: 'They're showing signs that they've developed nicely, despite their long hospitalization. 'They're doing things that are rather appropriate: Owen was pulling on Emmett's ear, and they're playing back and forth.' The family are raising money to help pay for the boysâ€™ medical care through the sale of T-shirts on the blog and through donations.","Owen and Emmett Ezell were joined at the abdomen and shared a liver .

Volunteer Adam Reichart, 44, began the project by standing outside a supermarket in San Francisco and pleading: 'It's my birthday tomorrow'. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: Homeless people in San Francisco are being fitted with $300 GoPro cameras to reveal what it is like being shunned every day from their point of view. Pictured: Former drug addict Adam Reichart, 44 . Ignored: Mr Reichart stood outside a supermarket and begged, pleading: 'It's my birthday tomorrow' But as several hours passed almost no one stopped or even looked at him. Eventually the footage shows passers-by donating money and, as the day draws to a close, two women buy him a hot meal. The moving video is accompanied by the story of Mr Reichart's life, which has seen him sleeping on the streets regularly for 30 years after his mother and wife died and he became a drug addict. Drug-free for the last four years, he met the founders of the Homeless GoPro project in January and hopes to be the first of a long line of homeless people wearing the cameras. But this week he had all his teeth surgically extracted, making him even more unapproachable in the eyes of some. Shunned: Most of the passers-by avoid making eye contact. Mr Reichart claimed people are losing social skills . Mr Reichart said: 'In the last five years I've probably known 100 normal everyday working people who become homeless. About half of them lose their friends - their family treats them differently' The volunteers have the . high-definition video cameras fixed to their chests and the footage is . picked up later by the project's organisers and uploaded to YouTube. Mr . Reichart said: 'I notice every day that people are losing their . compassion and their empathy, not just for homeless people but for . society in general. 'I feel technology has changed so much where people are emailing and don't talk face to face any more that people are losing their social skills, their compassion, their empathy and their feeling of real life. 'In the last five years I've probably known 100 normal everyday working people who become homeless. About half of them lose their friends - their family treats them differently. 'Everyone asks ""why did you end up on the streets?"" but not everyone realises homelessness is a product of society'. Donation: A man gives money to Mr Reichart as he begs outside the supermarket. Co-founder of the project Kevin Adler, 29, said he was inspired to start the work after his uncle was homeless for 30 years . Good Samaritans: Two women bring a hot meal to the man after he has been begging outside the store . Organisers plan to enlist several more of San Francisco's 6,500 homeless people. Co-founder of the project Kevin Adler, 29, told MailOnline he was inspired to start the work after a family tragedy. Project: Kevin Adler and Adam Reichart . 'My uncle Mark was homeless for about 30 years,' he said. 'He had schizophrenia and died about 10 years ago. 'I . visited his grave for the first time at Thanksgiving and I felt there . were many other people still living in Mark's situation whose stories . hadn't been told. 'A $300 high-definition camera is usually reserved for extreme sports and weekend adventures so it's surprising for it to give us a window into the lives of people we're not usually tuned into. 'Adam's a brilliant human being who has been on the streets for the same amount of time as my uncle Mark. 'They wear the cameras for a few hours and are really just going about their normal days. The purpose is to build empathy because that's a very powerful force connecting people together. 'It's what we all probably experience - there's a lot of implicit rejection where people just turn their shoulder away. 'But then there are brief moments of humanity, when someone buys him lunch or gives him a few dollars or even just stops to say hi.' He added: 'We chose not to conceal the cameras for the reason that some people may object to having surreptitious videos being taken of them. But most people seemed to act as they would when seeing any homeless person.' For more information visit homelessgopro.com.","Adam Reichart, 44, was on and off San Francisco's streets for 30 years .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A couple of Iowa sisters, aged 8 and 10, have taken to YouTube to lobby their state representative into reducing the minimum age on when kids can fire handguns. Nathan Gibson, from Johnston, began taking his daughters Meredith and Natalie to the shooting range when they were five, but on a recent trip he was told a little known Iowa law prevented children younger than 14 from using a handgun at all, even with parental supervision. Outraged, he has contacted local and state officials to argue against the law, and the girls' videos begging 'please let me use my .22' will be used by the Iowa Gun Owners organization from today in its campaign to eliminate age restrictions for handgun use all together. Scroll down for videos . Little gun lobbyists: Natalie Gibson, 8, pictured, and her sister Meredith, have taken to YouTube to lobby their state representative into reducing the minimum age on when kids can fire handguns . Shocked: Nathan Gibson, from Johnston, began taking his daughters Meredith, right, and Natalie, left, to the shooting range when they were five, but on a recent trip he was told a little known Iowa law prevented children younger than 14 from using a handgun at all, even with parental supervision . In a video now posted on YouTube, the fourth-grader says: 'It's fun shooting my gun with my daddy, and I can learn how to safely handle it and protect myself and my family if needed to.' Both girls claim that they love shooting their guns because it means they can spend time with their father. 'It makes me feel sad because then I won't be able to spend time with my daddy,' Natalie told the Des Moines Register about the law. The law barring any handgun use by youths under 14 gained attention earlier this year when a Democratic legislator tried to lower the legal age from 14 to 12 in a bid to allow more kids to safely practice shooting handguns. The bill failed to become law, however, because of the media coverage more gun ranges are enforcing the existing law and telling youngsters to leave, even if they've been shooting at that range for years. Angry: Mr Gibson, pictured, has contacted local and state officials to argue against the law . Fun: In a video now posted on YouTube, the fourth-grader, shown here when she was six, says: 'It's fun shooting my gun with my daddy, and I can learn how to safely handle it and protect myself and my family if needed to' Now: Meredith, shown now, poses with her handgun and a wide smile . In contrast, state law provides no . minimum age for long guns, including Mr Gibson's AR-15 .308 deer-hunting . rifle, and Meredith points out this quirk in her bubbly video. Under Iowa law, 'I'm unable to shoot my handgun,' Meredith says in the message to Republican state Representative Clel Baudler. Baudler is the chairman of the Iowa House Public Safety Committee. Politician: The girls are lobbying Rep. Clel Baudler, R-Greenfield, pictured . She . then, without looking at her handgun, locks the slide, ejects the . magazine and sets the empty magazine on her family's kitchen table . before walking over to the .308 rifle. 'I think we can both agree that this gun is way too big for me,' she says. The rationale behind the difference in . the laws is that long guns are used for hunting, and children should be . able to hunt with supervision from a parent. But child psychiatrist Kathleen Adams told the Register that handguns should be treated differently because they're about self-defense, not sport. She told the newspaper that teaching kids how to shoot handguns implies there might be an appropriate time for them to use the gun in a situation they consider dangerous, whether an adult is there or not. 'We should teach them ways to solve . conflicts that don't involve guns,' said Adams. 'And it's really . important for kids to have confidence that their world is safe and that . the adults in their world are going to keep them safe.' Anne . Starr, the CEO at Orchard Place, a Des Moines psychiatric medical . institute for youths, said keeping unstable children away from guns was . 'a good thing.' But she said she was undecided as far as the general youth population was concerned. Fair: Child psychiatrist Kathleen Adams told the Register that handguns should be treated differently from hunting guns because they're about self-defense, not sport . 'Each kid is different in terms of their development and what they can and can't handle and the culture in a family and whether guns are part of that culture,' Starr said. Mr Gibson said his girls are involved in other activities such as dance and basketball but shooting was a big part of their father-daughter time. And Iowa Gun Owners' executive director, Aaron Dorr, told the Register this was not only fun but a 'wise' decision. 'Any father would be wise to show his daughter how to defend herself,' he said. Dorr is hoping the Gibson sisters' videos, which he plans to distribute widely, will help the organization get the guns back in the hands of children soon. 'The real sad thing for us is more and more kids are now being kicked off gun ranges like the Gibson kids,' he told Register. 'But it's a simple fix. Take out the age restriction.'","Nathan Gibson, from Johnston, Iowa, began taking his daughters Meredith and Natalie to the shooting range when they were five .

"By . Stian Alexander . It seems man's best friend has fallen out with his master. Men today prefer cats as pets, while dogs are more popular among women, a survey of 1,685 pet owners in the UK has suggested. The poll, conducted by bed retailer Time4Sleep, found that 34 per cent of men owned a cat, with 33 per cent owning a dog. Men today prefer cats as pets, while dogs are more popular among women according to a new survey . A total of 36 per cent of women, however, owned a dog, with just 33 per cent having a cat - making dogs ‘woman’s best friend’. The poll also found that 25 per cent of pet owners allow their pets to sleep on their beds at night. Cats, however, are more welcome as sleeping partners than dogs, with 28 per cent of cat owners saying their moggy curled up with them every night, compared to 22 per cent of dog owners. The earliest use of the phrase ‘man’s best friend’ came in 1821 in a poem in the The New-York Literary Journal which read: The faithful dog - why should I striveTo speak his merits, while they liveIn every breast, and man’s best friendDoes often at his heels attend . A total of 48 per cent of those polled said that rather than share a bed with their pet, they made them a comfy bed of their own elsewhere in their home. The research also found that Facebook users are more likely to own a dog (50 per cent), whereas Twitter users favour cats (51 per cent). Jonathan Warren, managing director of Time4Sleep, said today yesterday: 'While we had initially set out to explore the sleeping habits of pets and their owners, we stumbled across research that defied the long held stereotypes of which gender was most likely to own a certain pet. 'Pets are frequently seen as an integral part of the family, so it is not surprising that over half of the population are sharing their bed and letting them enjoy a comfortable, if slobbery, night of sleep.'","Survey of 1,685 pet owners suggests men prefer cats .

"By . Dan Bloom . Not everyone gets away with wearing an arctic fox on their head. But this woman in Norway had no choice - when the animal leaped up her back, crushed her hood over her eyes and used her head as a vantage point to look for treats. The scene was captured by wildlife photographer Pål Jakobsen, who offered himself up as bait with two friends as they stepped into the lair of wild foxes and wolves in the world's northernmost animal park. What does the fox say? Photographer Pal Jakobsen captured the moment an arctic fox, critically endangered within Norway, jumped onto the head of his friend Lene . Wily: Just out of shot is the animal's keeper, who was dangling treats for it to eat over the visitor's head. Temperatures on the day were as low as minus 22C . Boast: The Polar Park Arctic Wildlife Centre in Norway is the northernmost of its kind in the world and has three arctic foxes. Hardly any survive in Norway and Sweden . Mr Jakobsen was at the Polar Park Arctic Wildlife Centre . in Norway, and although many of its beasts are normally deemed dangerous they were surprisingly tender - even kissing his female friends. Guests are, however, warned not to look directly into the eyes of wolves. In his series of photos, the over-eager fox can be seen climbing on to the head of the photographer's friend Lene Kvandal as keeper Stig Sletten dangled treats over her head just out of shot. Mr Jakobsen said: 'On a lovely cold day with temperatures below minus 22C, I found myself inside the fence with arctic foxes. 'Stig is holding up his hand with goodies to attract the fox’s interest - then he moves his hand up above the head of Lene, causing the fox to climb at full speed on the back of Lene and up to the top of the head in order to reach the goodies.' He added: 'I felt both awe and curiosity when we went in to the wolves, but tried to remain calm at all the time thinking about how I should conduct myself as a photographer and how wolves would react to the camera. Adventurous: Wolves are normally afraid of humans, but the ones at the wildlife park are deliberately accustomed to human contact and are more friendly . Give us a kiss: The wolves even licked the faces of their visitors at the wildlife park. Mr Jakobsen said: 'Meeting these socialised wolves has been a very special experience' Affectionate: The wildlife park does not keep animals in cages and instead makes sure they are accustomed to human contact . 'I had heard that one should not challenge them by staring directly into in the eyes.' Wolves are genetically afraid of humans which means non-socialised wolves in captivity are afraid of humans, and live under stressful conditions. Those at the park accustomed to being in close contact with humans, and there are no cages. Mr Jakobsen said: 'We must remember that the wolves in principle are very afraid of people, but that these two wolves who are in the photos are socialised to have relations with humans. 'For my own part, meeting these socialised wolves has been a very special experience that will not be forgotten.' Although arctic foxes are not endangered worldwide, the species is listed as critically endangered in Norway. Between 1998 and 2008 just 111 arctic fox litters were registered in the country, alongside another 130 in Sweden - with none at all in 2009. Mr Jakobsen said: 'I felt both awe and curiosity when we went in to the wolves, but tried to remain calm at all the time thinking about how I should conduct myself' Professional: The stunning photographs were captured by wildlife photographer Pal Jakobsen, pictured, from Norway .","Scene was captured by photographer Pål Jakobsen at the world's northernmost animal park in Norway at minus 22C .

"By . Darren Boyle . It is the world's most expensive skateboard coated in pure gold and is on sale for a staggering £9,000. The board has been plated in pure gold and still works normally despite its precious paint job. According to the board's creator, the lucky buyer will have to wear special gloves to avoid smudging the mirror-finish. This is the world's most expensive skateboard and is on sale for £9,000 . Each of the board's eight components works normally despite being plated in pure gold . The board was created for New York skateboard shop SHUT by designer Matthew Willet. He said it was important that the skateboard was fully functional especially because of the price tag. As a result, all six of the components are in working order despite being electroplated in gold and weighing 80 percent more than a traditional board. After each component was covered in gold it was hand polished to a mirror finish. This means that the lucky buyer will have to wear special cotton archival gloves to avoid damaging the surface. However, the gold plating means the board is 80 percent heavier than a normal board and may make it more difficult to control . Mr Willet said: 'The board took a lot of trial and error, but it the end came out amazing and everyone learned a lot. 'The process is top secret, but we now know what we are capable of. 'I've been skateboarding my whole life so making this was kind of a no brainer. 'People have been really excited about the board as well - we've had some great responses and a lot of interest.

"By . Associated Press . Portland officials are once again preparing to flush millions of gallons of treated water because someone urinated in a city reservoir. Water Bureau Administrator David Shaff said 38 million gallons will be discarded after a 19-year-old was videotaped in the act on Wednesday. Three years ago, the city drained a 7.5-million-gallon reservoir at the same Mount Tabor location in southeast Portland. Scroll down to watch surveillance footage of the incident . Teenage boys were caught on surveillance tape breaking into the reservoir. One of the urinated into the water source meaning that 38 million gallons will now be flushed . The open reservoirs hold water that's already been treated and goes directly into mains for distribution to customers. The . urine poses little risk - animals routinely deposit waste without . creating a public health crisis - but Shaff said he doesn't want to . serve water that was deliberately tainted. 'There . is at least a perceived difference from my perspective,' Shaff said. 'I . could be wrong on that, but the reality is our customers don't . anticipate drinking water that's been contaminated by some yahoo who . decided to pee into a reservoir.' Water . quality test samples have been taken from the reservoir, with results . due on Thursday. The water will be drained into the sewage system that . eventually dumps into the Columbia River. In the meantime, Shaff said the city has plenty of water to meet demand. 'It's . easy to replace those 38 million gallons of water,' Shaff said. 'We're . not in the arid Southwest; we're not in drought-stricken parts of Texas . or Oklahoma.' Portland Water Bureau is being forced to flush 38million gallons of water from one of it reservoirs in Mount Tabor Park in Portland, Oregon . The incident occurred shortly after 1am, when Water Bureau security personnel noticed three men on camera at Mount Tabor Reservoir No. 5. One was seen on video urinating through an iron fence, officials said. Minutes later, two other young men attempted to scale the fence. The three men, whose names have not been released, were cited for trespassing and excluded from Mount Tabor Park. A 19-year-old was cited for public urination. The kidney-shaped reservoir built in 1911 is drained for cleaning each spring and fall. The spring draining was done about three weeks ago, the Water Bureau said. The reservoir is one of five the city is in the process of replacing with underground storage to comply with federal regulations. Floy Jones, co-founder of the group Friends of the Reservoirs, criticized the decision to drain the reservoir, saying there's no evidence any urine reached the water and it wouldn't harm anyone if it did. 'It's extremely wasteful,' she said. The man who urinated into Portland's water supply in June 2011 eventually pleaded guilty to misuse of a reservoir and was sentenced to community service.","Three years ago, the city drained a 7.5-million-gallon reservoir at the same Mount Tabor location in southeast Portland .

"By . Misty White Sidell . On Sunday’s season premiere of Mad Men, Don Draper is told by wife Megan: ‘Don’t rip the ads out of my magazines.’ The show, which has become known for its strict historical accuracy, used a February 1969 issue of Playboy as a prop, and now the iconic title has released images of the actual ads Don might have wanted to keep. The issue featured ads for Volkswagen cars, Schlitz beer and Rise shaving lotion, as well as placements for cigarette companies Marlboro, Pall Mall and Sail of Holland. Playboy magazine experienced its heyday in the 1960s for its famous centerfolds and intellectual articles . Don and Megan have a discussion in their Los Angeles kitchen in the season seven premiere of Mad Men, just before Don was instructed not to rip ads from her magazines . Pall Mall's cigarette ad echoes a time when tobacco products were not heavily regulated by the government . Perhaps most pivotally, the ads . express many of Don’s vices that have so vividly been played out by . actor Jon Hamm over the show’s last seven seasons. A . heavy smoker, whose early run in the show was shaped by his copywriting . work for Lucky Strike,  Don would have been both personally and . professionally intrigued by the many cigarette ads that filled Playboy’s . pages. The tobacco ads’ lack of Surgeon General warnings and advisories may create a visual shock for the modern consumer. In fact cigarette companies at the time actually used medical findings to their advantage. Pall Mall's ad, for example, claims that its cigarettes are ‘now lower in “tar” than the best-selling filter king! Who says so? The latest U.S. Government figures.’ Another one of Don’s favorite substances, alcohol, presents itself in full-force throughout Playboy’s advertising. Schlitz beer, the preferred cheap beer of mid-century Ivy League-rs, uses a classic advertising approach in its 1969 campaign . Clubman's sports jackets advocate their innovations in synthetic materials (a growing sector at the time) and also promote their now laughably modest price of $65 . Placements for Lejon vermouth and . Antique bourbon position themselves as viable candidates for inclusion . on Don’s consistently-stocked office bar cart. While . it appears that Don is currently taking a rest from drinking, as it was . the primary reason for his suspension from work, previews for this . week’s episode depict his reoccurring difficulty with managing his . alcoholism. Don also has a . penchant for fast, sleek cars. The Ford Mach 1 Mustang ad depicting a . Yuppie couple in matching WASP attire would have no doubt piqued his . interest. However, he may have personally disagreed with Ford’s tagline: ‘If you haven’t got a past yet … get a Mach 1. Now.’ Marlboro's Playboy spot is unlike today's cigarette ads for its complete lack of medical warnings and advisories . Ford looks to appeal to an upper-middle-class consumer with its Mach 1 ad that is equal parts aspirational and attainable . Considering . that Don has an extensive past, which includes his original identity as . Dick Whitman, it’s likely that he would have rolled his eyes at this . line aimed at those who are more naïve. The . luxury products in Playboy’s glossy pages would have been published at . the tail end of the Sixties’ economic prosperity, which would soon wind . down in the following decade when an oil crisis, exceeding inflation, . and declining manufacturing rates would hit the U.S. In . 1969, the United States was also in the midst of the Vietnam War. The . ads published in Playboy exhibit how those Stateside were often . disconnected from the troops battling in horrific conditions many miles . away. Rise shaving lotion's ad evokes the Sixties' feminine ideals of big hair, doe-eyes, and a baby face . Lejon Vermouth's approach to advertising is incredibly straightforward, while also utilizing the long-form style of copy that was so popular in the pre-Internet era . Gilette's advertisement speaks to the hardships of the Vietnam War, still in full thrall in 1969 . Mad . Men’s seventh and final season debuted on April 13. The season has been . split into two parts, with the first seven episodes running through the . end of May, and the remainder airing next year. The Emmy-award winning show first premiered in 2007. Antique bourbon's hedonistic imagery perhaps aims to rope in a more rambunctious type of consumer . Cigarettes, this time a brand called Sail from Holland, looks to draw consumers by providing them with incentive to try the foreign brand .","In the Mad Men final season premiere Megan Draper instructs Don not to rip ads out of her February 1969 issue of Playboy .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and James  Nye . The selfie-taking tourist who was kicked in the head as a train sped by him has broken his silence over the ordeal. Jared .

CTV speculation the video was a Jimmy Kimmel hoax, and also that . the engineer was trying to save his life since he wasn't on the front of . the train. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . He got the boot!: Jared Michael (pictured left only a few days ago and right at Macchu Pichu earlier this year) was kicked in the head by a train engineer while trying to take a selfie . Here it comes: The train appears in view as the young man no doubt is getting excited about his upcoming picture . He also tried to defend his actions by saying a previous train passed by at a much slower speed. 'The . train definitely wasn't going the same speed as it was the first time. It was going normal train speed,' he told the network. 'That's why the . video starts within, like, a second of me getting kicked in the head.' Michael . is shown standing beside the tracks just as the train approaches and he . meets the business end of the engineer's black leather boot. 'I pressed play and was going to look at where the train was, but by that time, I already got kicked in the head,' he lamented. The . Canadian claimed the drop kick did not hurt was more of a shock than . anything else. He also doubted the engineer's intentions towards helping . him avoid more serious injury, or even possible death. Here comes trouble: The train's engineer appears on the side of the train ready to kick the kid . 'He . wasnâ€™t on the front of the train,' said the somewhat embarrassed man. 'He was on four feet off the front of the train kind of a thing. 'So if the train was going to hit me, it was going to hit me before his boot ever reached me.' Despite not believing the conductor had good intentions, he did sheepishly admit how silly the video has made him look. 'Honestly, . even the truth is a little ridiculous and it does make me look stupid,' he said. 'But it was an accident and I got it on film and I think it . would have been a shame to just throw it away.' Speaking to the Leader Post, Michael dismissed the criticism he has received around the world for the humiliating boot. 'I ignore it, they're just faceless people on the internet,' he told the paper. 'I never really understood the term 'I love haters' until now. 'If I wasn't the one in the video, I'd be making those comments too.' Uploading the video to YouTube, . Michael attempted to explain that he 'tried to take a selfie while a . train passed a 'safe' distance behind'. But conceded, 'I guess I was . still too close and got kicked in the head. I messed up'. However, despite his . admission of a lesson well-learned following the engineer's justified . swing, Michael's first reaction as captured in his video is amazement. Instead . of saying 'Ow!', or 'Maybe I was too close to the train', Michael . exclaims, 'Wow! I got kicked in the head! I think I got that on film!' Smack: The boot of the conductor connects cleanly with the young man . Follow-through: The train speeds past and the young man's head feels the full force of the conductors boot . But, before everyone . holds this up as another example of the extreme lengths people will now . go to for the perfect selfie, some have joked they see the hand at work . of America's prankster in chief, Jimmy Kimmel. Indeed, . Cooper Fleishman, the editor of the Dailydot tweeted that he would find . it amusing if the video was revealed to be a set-up, filmed on an ABC . studio lot and that the engineer was in fact Kimmel. But this has since been proven not to be the case. The .

But despite their fluffy appearance, albino kangaroos like Alberta aren't expected to survive for long if they live in the wild. The marsupials' startling white coats are believed to attract a higher number of predators, including wild foxes, dogs and even eagles. Albino kangaroos are very rare and don't have a long life expectancy if they are living in the wild . It is also thought they are more likely to develop skin cancer and sunburn, as well as having a genetic predisposition towards sight and hearing difficulties.

"By . Ruth Styles . The Queen is famous for her love of horses and so are Zara Phillips and Princess Anne. But it seems they aren't the only royals with a passion for all things equine. Sophie Wessex, a keen rider in her own right, was among the racing aficionados to turn out for the first race of the day at Newmarket - and even had a runner. Unfortunately for the royal, her horse, Zilber, failed to make the grade and could only manage a third place finish in the Alex Scott Maiden Stakes, well behind the winner, Provident Spirit. Enjoying the day: A casually dressed Sophie Wessex chats to jockey Adam Kirby ahead of the first race . Staying ahead in the style stakes: The Countess of Wessex teamed her tweed suit with chic patent boots . Despite the disappointing result, the Countess appeared on good form as she enjoyed the sunshine and a chat with co-owner, the Countess of Derby, and Zilber's jockey Adam Kirby. The day out at the races is a break from what has been a very busy schedule for the Earl and Countess of Wessex, with more engagements to follow next week. Next week will see the royal couple tour Gloucestershire, with visits to the Clearwell Caves and Three Choirs Vineyard in Newent pencilled in. The following day, the couple are scheduled to visit a number of historic churches in Oxfordshire, before the Countess continues on alone to a local packaging factory. Briefing: The Countess of Wessex and the Countess of Derby talk tactics with jockey, Adam Kirby . Runner up: Zilber, pictured right, took third place behind the eventual winner Provident Spirit, centre . All smiles: A well wrapped up Sophie Wessex appeared to be enjoying her day out in the sunshine . Passion for horses: Although not as committed as the Queen, Sophie Wessex is also a horsewoman . For now, and with the Easter break to look forward to, the Countess appeared relaxed and happy as she watched the races in the bright Suffolk sunshine. And although she didn't quite manage to take home the trophy, she did at least fare better than the Queen, who last week saw her filly Enliven trot into a lowly seventh place in the Coln Valley Stud Bridget Maiden Fillies Stakes at Newbury. The monarch couldn't conceal a grimace as she watched her horse, who had been introduced to President Higgins of Ireland the day before, slope across the finish line. The Queen's career as a racehorse owner spans more than 60 years and began with the handful she inherited on the death of her father George VI. Like her father and grandfather before her, the Queen's horses race in purple and scarlet silks enlivened with gold braiding. During her long association with racing, the Queen has triumphed in more than 1600 races and has won every one of the British Classics, with the exception of the Epsom Derby. Last year, Estimate, a filly owned by the Queen, romped home to take the prestigious Gold Cup at Royal Ascot - much to the delight of the monarch. While Sophie Wessex regularly appears in the carriage alongside the Queen at Royal Ascot, she, unlike her mother-in-law, is yet to win a race there.

"By . Louise Boyle . On-again off-again couple Johnny Weir and husband Victor Voronov have called off their reconciliation one day after saying they were getting back together. The former Olympic figure skater and his estranged husband announced they were remaining apart just hours after deciding to give things another ago. The couple's decision comes just one day after Weir had fired back at Voronov's demands for a public apology with a bizarre and explicit post-nuptial agreement. It's over...again: Victor Voronov and Johnny Weir (pictured at NY Fashion Week in 2012) have called off their reconciliation today just hours after the estranged couple said they were getting back together . The skater's mother is to blame because of her interfering, according to RadarOnline. 'Victor . thinks Johnnyâ€™s mother has too much control of him, and has treated him . like a second class citizen,' a source told the gossip website, adding . that Mr Voronov feels like there are 'three people' in his marriage. As part of his conditions for a reconciliation, Weir . reportedly issued a five-page document including a list of no-no's like . extramarital sexting and mutual masturbation and bi-yearly STD tests . from both parties, TMZ reported on Tuesday. The agreement addresses what was one of the juicier headlines to come out of the couple's bitter battle: cheating. Voronov at one point accused Weir publicly of engaging in threesomes outside the marriage and cheating with a porn star. The post-nup says those things are off-limits, as are aggressive flirting, oral sex and hookup via social apps like Grindr. While presumably legally binding, the agreement does not cease to be crafted in the most Johnny Weir of ways. Voronov snapped this picture of a bite mark Weir allegedly left on his arm during an especially heated fight prior to the divorce filing . A section about 'ultimatums' in the relationship ends with a loophole for the champion skater. 'If I give you one more day to get your bank records to me,' it reads. 'Then I want to have a free f*** of anyone I want.' The nasty divorce battle had been publicly escalating since February. Johnny . was reportedly set to move back into their home over the weekend, but . only if the figure skater agreed to publicly apologize to Voronov, TMZ reported. Voronov's agreement also stipulates that Weir's mother Pamela must stay out of the couple's private life and personal finances. According to the report, . Weir was planning to move back into their home as early as Monday but . the couple were seen bickering over their own reconciliation agreement, which likjely gave the skater the idea for his own legally binding document. Weir filed for divorce from . Voronov, whom he married at the end of 2011 after just months of dating, . in February while working as a commentator for NBC at the Sochi . Olympics. The split . sparked a series of bitter digs - from Weir claiming Voronov destroyed . his beloved Birkin bags, and Voronov claiming his ex sent text messages . to gay porn star Michael Lucas and engaged in threesomes. Pettiness aside: The couple's bickering revolved around ownership of designer bags and other valuables including a Faberge egg. Voronov at one point claimed his figure skater husband held their dog Tema hostage . Voronov . accused his estranged husband of sending a 'hateful' and 'disgusting' email and filed court papers saying Weir had violated a temporary . restraining order by sending the email. 'Johnny sent Victor a disgusting, . hateful email which violated the no contact order as part of the . temporary restraining order he got last week,' a source told Radar. Voronov had the restraining order put . in place after an incident on March 5 in which Weir allegedly hit him on . the arm and threw a wooden Russian doll at him. 'So . on Monday, Victor filed a police report with cops in Rutherford, New . Jersey,' the source added. 'Johnny could be in very serious legal . trouble if the judge finds him in contempt for violating terms of the . temporary restraining order.' Voronov, . 29, claims Weir committed multiple acts of adultery - including an . affair with an unidentified Chicago club owner. He also says Weir is . holding their dog Tema hostage. Nasty divorce: Weir, pictured naked on his show Be Good Johnny Weir, was accused by Vornonov of sending  nude photos and steamy messages to men online, and his husband also has nude images of him . Nasty divorce: Weir said he was not concerned about his ex sharing naked images of him following the split. He claimed Voronov physically and emotionally abused him . In legal documents obtained by . TMZ, Voronov alleges Weir forced him out of the closet and that he . married him because his life with a Georgetown-educated lawyer would . make compelling reality TV. In . addition to the allegations of adultery and cruelty, Voronov is also . requesting a judge to force Weir to return property the lawyer claims . the Olympian took from him. These . include 20 furs - including a $125,000 coat made from sable - a . crocodile Celine bag, 40 Balenciaga bags, one green and one orange . Hermes Birkin and 12 Chanel bags. The source also added that Weir 'categorically denies' the adultery allegations. In . an interview with Access Hollywood, Weir made his own swipes at his ex, . claiming his non-practicing attorney husband was often abusive towards . him and relied on his money. He claimed he was struggling with a 'personal hell' of an emotionally and physically abusive partner. 'Sochi . was one of the hardest times in my life,' he said. 'When I was on the . broadcasting, I escaped my own personal hell that I was living in. 'My . husband was behaving very erratically. The majority of the time off . camera I was in tears. I was on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a . good place.' Olympic favorite: Weir was a hit as he commentated on the Sochi Olympics with Tara Lipinski earlier this year - but he has said that behind the scenes he was struggling with his demanding husband . He added that . their fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of . control, including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the . police. A picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man's forearm. Weir . officially came out as gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, . citing a recent string of gay suicides as his reason to be open about . his sexuality. On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov. But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery. 'A . marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage . between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both . constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's . constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 70-year-old woman has opened up about her own 'sexual awakening', 15 years after her husband died. Lynn Brown Rosenberg, a self-confessed 'sexually conservative nice Jewish girl' from California, revealed in a candid essay for Salon that at age 69 she 'was practically a virgin' because of her own sexual repression. But now she wanted 'mad, passionate, down-and-dirty sex' and was willing to try anything in order to experience the 'excitement' she had been missing her entire life. It wasn't long before Ms Rosenberg found free dating sex websites where she signed up a Sensualnights16 and listed her age as 63, with a picture that showed her 'lips, chin and breasts underneath a T-shirt' (pictured) Ms Rosenberg's urologist suggested she get a vibrator and start with some porn. 'Thirty years ago I couldnâ€™t imagine myself stooping that low,' she confessed. 'And I didnâ€™t have a high regard for porn, either, labeling it as disgusting.' But forcing herself out of her comfort zone, she visited the West Hollywood specialty store Pleasure Chest and decided to try something called 'Budding Bliss'. 'I bought a porn DVD. Why not? If I was going to stoop, why not stoop all the way?' she said, adding that much to her surprise, she began to have orgasms. 'It became my new hobby,' she confessed. But after two weeks, she found herself needing 'greater or different stimuli' to be able to climax. Ms Rosenberg's therapist guided her to free Internet porn ('My horizons were expanding,' she states) and after several research attempts she stumbled across a few videos that she began to watch 'many times'. 'The . way the man moaned and sighed affected me immensely,' Ms Rosenberg . explains. 'I discovered I loved watching a man and hearing his . expression of release so much so that I wanted to get inside the video . myself. I wanted to be the woman pleasuring him.' It wasn't long before she found free dating sex websites where Ms Rosenberg signed up a Sensualnights16 and . listed her age as 63, 'rationalizing that the further away . from 70 I was, the more men I would interest. This was the only thing I . lied about,' she insisted, adding that she even posted a picture. 'Each time I took a new step in my . sexual exploration I became fearful. What was I getting myself into? Was I going to get into trouble?' 'But not . wanting my face shown on a sex site, I posted one in which a hat was . pulled down over my eyes.  All it showed were my lips, chin and breasts . underneath a T-shirt,' she said. After a 33-year-old man named Bill contacted her, Ms Rosenberg decided to give the chat a try -- despite their age difference. 'Each time I took a new step in my sexual exploration I became fearful. What was I getting myself into?  Was I going to get into trouble?' she asked. 'Yet, despite my fears, I convinced myself to keep going. To utter these forbidden words -- c***, p***, f*** -- was liberating. No, exhilarating! Walls broke down. 'No longer would I be constricted by what I was supposed to think, supposed to do, supposed to feel.' Referring to notes she had taken down from several of her favorite porn videos, Ms Rosenberg began to type. 'Would you like me to take the tip of your c*** inside my mouth?' she wrote to Bill. 'My heart was racing. I was embarrassed! Excited! Writing word for word, question after question what the woman in the [porn] video said, I was breaking with all propriety, everything I learned from my parents on how to be a nice Jewish girl,' Ms Rosenberg confessed. She decided to join a second site, this time listing her age as 45. 'I wanted to see if the lowered age would make a difference and it did.  I was flooded with requests to chat,' she said, adding that she 'rejected all men who werenâ€™t smiling'. '[Men] talked dirty to me -- very dirty -- and I learned how much I liked it,' she said. 'I had two glasses of wine before logging on, and as [they] said words to me that no one had ever said, I began to go off-script. I was finally getting the hang of this. Our conversations were raw. Graphic. Forbidden. Exciting.' Ms Rosenberg explains that she is still in the process of 'finding herself' sexually, but that her communication online has helped her to be more sexually explicit -- both in and out of bed. 'I never would have guessed this is how my sexual awakening would take place. But at 70 years old, I was finally free.'","As a self-confessed 'nice Jewish girl', Lynn Brown Rosenberg grew up believing sex wasn't supposed to be enjoyed ."

Borgar Kristensen, 50, stopped on the E18 in Telemark, Norway, when he found the animal curled up inside the front of his Peugeot. But when he and three colleagues unwedged what they thought was the dead animal with a stick, instead of collapsing into the road it ran off almost unharmed. Furry lucky: This badger survived being hit by a Peugeot at 50mph in Norway and scurried off almost unharmed . He told MailOnline: I drove maybe half a kilometre and stopped and it was still there. I was amazed it was still alive.' Mr Kristensen, from the southern city of Porsgrunn, was inspired to reveal the photo after a British Peugeot driver arrived home to find a baby deer in her radiator grille. The unnamed woman hit the Muntjac deer as she drove through Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, and found it embedded in the front of her Peugeot 207 after driving for two miles. She called the RSPCA and firefighters dismantled the front of her car to free the deer, which survived. Mr Kristensen, who had the photo on . his phone for a year before revealing it, was unable to avoid the badger . because there was a car coming the other way when he spotted it. Deer in headlights: The deer survived the impact and was still alive but was stuck deep in the narrow gap in the front of the car after being hit in Potters Bar, Hertforshire. Firefighters had to dismantle the grille . He told The Local: 'After four or five minutes, the animal went down the road. It was not badly injured.' To Norwegian newspaper VG, he said: 'When we started to poke away at it, revived it. 'We spent some time trying to get it loose, and it remained for a few minutes on the tarmac before it arose. 'When it got to his feet, it staggered toward the grove. It was probably really knocked out.'","The animal was hit by 50-year-old Borgar Kristensen in Telemark, Norway .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . In an apparent breach of U.S. House and Senate email servers, an activist expressing opposition to surveillance work of the National Security Agency has posted hundreds of email addresses and passwords of Congressional staffers, demanding change on internet privacy. 'We mean it. This is a pivotal moment for America,' the activist known as 'OpLastResort' posted to Twitter, which drew support from the group 'Anonymous,' a loosely knit group of hackers. The message included hashtags #Congress #Senate #FISA #PRISM, referring to the National Security Agency surveillance program revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

The vast majority of them come from the House of Representatives, although there are some from the U.S. Attorney General's office, the Senate and even New York's comptroller. The list of emails also included several press secretaries in both the House and Senate. According to The Hill, OpLastResort 'warned Congress in a tweet that it's closely watching how lawmakers respond to the revelations over a pair of controversial National Security Agency surveillance programs.' Email addresses were found from both Senators in Georgia with nine from Senator Saxby Chambliss' office, three from Senator Johnny Isakson and twenty-two were from the office of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. The House Security Offices have tracked the leaks to the iConstituent newsletter product, which is used by press and communications staff members to reach out to constituents.

"By . James  Nye . A young man who tried to take a selfie right next to the tracks while a huge locomotive passed by him has learned the hard way why it's a bad idea. Jared Michael received a well-deserved boot to his head from the train's engineer who yelled at him as he motored past the foolish would-be photographer. Uploading the video to YouTube, Michael attempted to explain that he 'tried to take a selfie while a train passed a 'safe' distance behind'. But conceded, 'I guess I was still too close and got kicked in the head. I messed up'. Scroll down for video . Selfie time: The young man prepares his angles for the picture of a train he is planning . However, despite his admission of a lesson well-learned following the engineer's justified swing, Michael's first reaction as captured in his video is amazement. Instead of saying 'Ow!', or 'Maybe I was too close to the train', Michael exclaims, 'Wow! I got kicked in the head! I think I got that on film!' Here it comes: The train appears in view as the young man no doubt is getting excited about his upcoming picture . Here comes trouble: The train's engineer appears on the side of the train ready to kick the kid . Smack: The boot of the conductor connects cleanly with the young man . Follow-through: The train speeds past and the young man's head feels the full force of the conductors boot . But, before everyone holds this up as another example of the extreme lengths people will now go to for the perfect selfie, some have joked they see the hand at work of America's prankster in chief, Jimmy Kimmel. Indeed, Cooper Fleishman, the editor of the Dailydot tweeted that he would find it amusing if the video was revealed to be a set-up, filmed on an ABC studio lot and that the engineer was in fact Kimmel. The ABC late-night host has a past history for viral internet pranks - during the Sochi Winter Olympics he managed to get a picture of a wolf roaming the athletes village to go viral.

"By . Beth Stebner . and Michael Zennie . A U.S. Senator has revealed that the FBI didn't know Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev traveled to the volatile Russian republic of Dagestan last year because his name was misspelled on travel documents. Anti-terrorism authorities never interviewed 26-year-old Tsarnaev about his visit to the region, which is home to organized extremist Islamist militias who have committed numerous terrorist attacks against Russian authorities and moderate Sufi Muslims. Russian intelligence tipped off the FBI in 2011 that Tsarnaev might be radicalized and was likely planning a trip to Russia. FBI agents interviewed and investigated Tsarnaev then, but later closed the case after finding no evidence of 'terrorism activity, domestic or foreign.' Family ties: This family photo shows the Tsarnaev brothers and their sisters as children. Dzhokhar is seen bottom center and older brother Tamerlan is pictured top center . A look back: Tamerlan, center bottom, is seen as a baby with his father Anzor, left, and mother Zubeidat, center, and uncle Muhamad Suleimanov, right . Strife: The Russian region of Degastan has long had a significant Islamist militant movement that has been responsible for numerous bomb attacks and assassinations . Both Tsarnaev brothers are immigrants . with family roots in Chechnya, another Russian region in the north . Caucuses marked by Islamist militancy. Tamerlan was killed after a shootout with police early Friday. Authorities say he likely died after his younger brother ran over him while fleeing in a stolen SUV. Dzhokhar was dramatically captured Friday night and is being questioned by federal agents at a hospital, where he recovering from what is reportedly a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the neck. Tsarnaev and his younger brother . Dzhokhar then dropped off the FBI's radar entirely until they emerged as . suspects in last Monday's bombing at the Boston Marathon that killed . three people and maimed dozens of others. 'He went over to Russia, but . apparently when he got on the airplane, they misspelled his name, so it . never went into the system that he actually went to Russia,' Senator . Lindsey Graham told Fox News on Monday. The South Carolina Republican said he received his information from the assistant FBI director. Graham had previously said the agency 'dropped the ball' by not tracking Tamerlan Tsarnaev before the attacks. On Monday he softened his tone. 'One of two things happened, the FBI . either dropped the ball or our system doesn’t allow the FBI to follow . this guy in an appropriate fashion,' Graham said. Dropping the ball: Lawmakers demanded on Sunday . why the FBI hadn't put more flags on Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan . Tsarnaev, pictured left in 2010, and right, last Monday, minutes before . the attack . In custody: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is in . critical condition at a Boston hospital after he was discovered Friday . evening hiding in a boat in Watertown . Outspoken: New York Sen. Charles Schumer, left, D-New York, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, raised questions on CNN over the FBI's follow-up on the elder Tsarnaev brother . 'I think once the Russians made the . request, the FBI did a good job of looking at him. The reason we didn’t . know he went to Russia is because the name was misspelled.' Much of what Tsarnaev did on his six-month trip to Russia is still a mystery to U.S. investigators. Neighbors . say Tsarnaev spent at least a few weeks in . Dagestan. On Sunday, House of Representatives . Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul wrote to the FBI and . other officials asking why Tamerlan Tsarnaev did not raise suspicions . after Russia asked the bureau to investigate him two years ago. 'Because if he was on the radar and . they let him go, he's on the Russians' radar, why wasn't a flag put on . him, some sort of customs flag?,' McCaul, a Texas Republican, said on . CNN's 'State of the Union.’ 'And I'd like to know what intelligence Russia has on him as well.' Sen. Charles Schumer (D-New York) was largely supportive of the FBI’s efforts, but questioned why . Tamerlan wasn’t interviewed upon his return from Russia, where he had . been for six months in 2012. ‘There . were things on his website that indicated that he had been . radicalized,’ Schumer said. ‘I think there’s a lot of questions that . have to be answered.’ Dwelling: The Tsarnaev brothers lived in this nondescript house in Cambridge, just across the river from Boston . The . FBI interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011, shortly after Russia's Federal . Security Service asked the agency to look into him as a possible . Islamist radical who might soon travel to Russia. It was unclear before . yesterday which foreign country had tipped off the FBI. When contacted, the FBI referred MailOnline to the statement it issued on April 19, saying the FBI’s search into Tamerlan’s records, travel history, and internet use yielded no results. Meanwhile, the organization has vehemently refuting a claim by the mother of the Tsarnaev brothers who said the bureau had spoken to Tamerlan following the two bombs exploding at last Monday’s marathon. FBI spokesman Michael Kortan told the Associated Press Sunday that the interviews in 2011 with Tamerlan and family members were the agency’s only contact with the bombing suspect. The Tsarnaevs' parents live in Russia. Less than a year after the FBI interview, Tsarnaev did in fact travel to the volatile Dagestan region of southern Russia on a six-month trip out of the United States. Frequent: Tamerlan was said to often visit the Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge, pictured . Republican Representative Peter King of New York told 'Fox News Sunday' he wondered why the FBI did not take more action after Tsarnaev returned to the United States last year and put statements on his website 'talking about radical imams.' Tamerlan Tsarnaev was not put on any no-fly list of suspected terrorists, U.S. officials said. But his brush with the FBI did raise concerns when he applied for U.S. citizenship last year, a source close to the bombing investigation said. Officials of the Homeland Security Department decided to give his application extra scrutiny because of the FBI interview and also due to an allegation against him of domestic abuse on a girlfriend in 2009, the source said. The citizenship application was still under consideration when Monday's bombing happened. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with U.S. police. and his brother Dzhokhar, 19, remained hospitalized in serious condition on Sunday, unable to speak. Three people were killed in Monday's bombing and 176 were injured. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said 'the FBI or the system dropped the ball' on the elder Tsarnaev. Graham told CNN that U.S. laws do not allow the FBI to follow up enough even if it does spot danger. Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York told CNN 'there's certainly a lot of questions' about the FBI's handling of the case. One U.S. counterterrorism official urged perspective. 'If we thoroughly investigated every one of these terrorism tips we get, we'd never get anything done,' he said. Guarded: Police guard the entrance to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Saturday, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is being treated, rooms away from 11 of the bombing victims . Critical: Tsarnaev, who was arrested Friday night, remains in critical condition under heavy guard after he was apprehended in Watertown . Captured: The FBI wanted poster released last night was updated to show that Dzhokhar was in custody . A senior U.S. law enforcement source . said that the number of tips received from Russian intelligence to the . FBI each year is 'not that many.' But . nationally, he said, the FBI receives at least 100 terrorism tips a day . - from the public, local and state law enforcement, other federal . agencies and the intelligence community. House . Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent, . defended the agency. The Michigan Republican said the FBI had performed a . 'very thorough' review of the older brother in 2011, but then it failed . to receive further cooperation from Russia. 'That case was closed prior to his travel, so I don't think we missed anything,' Rogers said on NBC's 'Meet the Press.' 'At . some point they (the FBI) asked, is there more clarifying information, . and never received that clarifying information, and at some point they . have nothing. You can't ask them to do something with nothing,' Rogers . said. But McCaul and King said the handling of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's case looked like it was part of a pattern. Open investigation: Law enforcement evidence technicians continue to investigate the scene of the Boston Marathon bombings on Saturday . The . 26-year-old 'appears to be the fifth person since September 11, 2001, . to participate in terror attacks despite being under investigation by . the FBI,' the pair said in a joint letter. They . named the others as Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric and leader of . al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen who was killed in a U.S. drone strike; . David Headley, an American who admitted scouting targets for a 2008 . Islamic militant raid on Mumbai; Carlos Bledsoe, who killed an Army . private outside a military recruiting office in Arkansas in 2009; and . Nidal Hasan, who is accused of killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, in . 2009. In addition, Umar . Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to bring down a U.S. jetliner over . Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, had been identified to the CIA as a . potential terrorist, the letter said, adding the cases 'raise the most . serious questions about the efficacy of federal counterterrorism . efforts.'

"By . Joshua Gardner . The minds behind The Simpsons have spent two years creating it's most expensive episode ever and it's first that places America's favorite family in a Springfield made of LEGOs. The episode dubbed Brick Like Me will be historic episode number 550 of what is now the longest running scripted series in television history. But it wasn't easy getting there. Is that you, Marge? A May 4 episode of The Simpsons puts America's favorite family into a LEGO-fied Springfield . Very special: The episode is historic on many fronts. Not only will it be the 550th episode, but it will also rank as the most expensive half-hour Simpsons episode ever produced . 'We've literally been at this thing for two years â€” twice the time it takes to do one of our regular episodes,' executive producer Matt Selman told TV Guide. The idea for the episode began with LEGO Group approaching Fox about creating a Simpson's character playset. LEGO's president of licensing Jill Wilfert told TV Guide that while merchandising was still being hashed out, the 80-year-old company suggested the show do a LEGO opening couch sequence. 'They quickly came back to us and said, 'Forget the couch; let's do an entire episode!'"" Wilfert said. It was the start of a delicate dance between two popular culture titans. 'We're pretty picky about how our brand is represented,' Wilfert said. 'No one at the show is used to dealing with creative input from the outside.' TV Guide's sneak peek of the May 4 episode revealed it to be a tamer offering than viewers are accustomed to from the series, but it did show LEGO showing more leg than usual. TV Guide writes: . 'LEGO Homer and LEGO Marge get frisky and are clearly heading to the bedroom. Their afterglow scene, with LEGO arms, hands and feet pulled apart and scattered everywhere, is priceless.' The central character of the episode is Homer, who is excited when he first finds himself in LEGO world but later finds himself wonders if it's where he and his now-plastic family belong. What Homer decides had yet to be revealed, but the work put into the episode and the beloved status of both brands ensures the show will me a memorable one. 'At its core, the LEGO brand is all about creativity and imagination,' said Wilfert of the pairing. 'We respect that in others.' The historic episode was the result of a delicate dance between titans: the 82-year-old LEGOs brand and the longest-running scripted series in the history of television . Playset: The show is also timed with the release of special edition collectible Simpsons LEGO men (and women and baby)","The primetime stalwart's historic 550th episode shows Homer waking up to all the town's characters turned to LEGOs .

"By . Richard Spillett . With their pristine white sheets, carefully-arranged tea cups and attentive teams of young nurses, the ambulance trains which brought injured Tommies back from the front could not have been further from the horrors of war the men had lived through. The insides of the specially-adapted train coaches were often the first taste of home the wounded soldiers experienced as they made their way back to Britain after months spent fighting in the trenches. These remarkable images of the First World War ambulance trains are now to form part of a new exhibition at York's National Railway Museum in November. The photos show the trains which brought soldiers back from the battlefield to the French ports of Calais and Bologne, where they were transferred onto boats before being taken, again by train, to hospitals throughout Britain. But, as the exhibition will reveal, the images contrast with some reports from the time. War poet Robert Grave described his journey in one of the carriages as a 'nightmare' in his war memoir, Goodbye To All That, and a nurse documented their 'frightful smells and dirt'. As the numbers of those injured in battle rose, so the trains became more important and were upgraded and expanded during the conflict, leading the same nurse to later comment they had become 'a joy after the tragedy' for those unfortunate enough to need them. The exhibition, marking the centenary of the War this year, will feature a series of images, sketches and personal accounts of the vital role of the railways during it and other conflicts. Each coach of the train was designated as a 'ward' and contained thirty-six beds in tiers of three. The middle bed folded back to enable sitting patients to use the lower bunk . Dedicated teams of nurses tended the soldiers. One described in her diary how a group of soldiers had been 'picked up without a spot of dressing on any of their wounds'. She added: 'The matron, a medical officer, and some of them got hold of some dressings and went round doing what they could in the tie, and others fed them' Trains transported troops through northern France before others brought them to hospitals from ports in Dover and Southampton. This photo shows members of the public waiting to view a touring ambulance train at an exhibition at Bradford Exchange station in 1916 . A 'standard' ambulance train consisted of sixteen cars, including a pharmacy car, two kitchens, a personnel car and a brake and stores van . A queue of people waiting to see an ambulance train which was on display at Huddersfield Station in November 1917. The train was one of those later shipped to France to bring casualties from Flanders to the French ports . A train in 1915 being loaded at Tilbury docks, on its way to the front. About 30 trains were sent overseas during the conflict . A newly built train on its way to Tilbury docks in Essex in 1916 . Soldiers and medical teams wait for one of the trains to arrive at an unknown station, with stretchers waiting to take the injured on to a hospital . The first ever hospital train, the Princess Christian, was built and transported to South Africa to be used during the Boer War during 1899-1902. The train supplied the wounded with clothing and toiletries and transported more than 7,000 seriously injured to Cape Town. In the . First World War, the UK Flour Millers' Association presented the Red . Cross with two ambulance trains, specially built and equipped, . constructed by Great Western and Eastern Railways. The trains were working in France during 1915, with another train, converted from ordinary French rolling stock, and carried 461,844 patients. It was then decided that a number of 'standard' trains should be built by various British railway companies to War Office specifications, and altogether thirty were eventually sent to the military forces overseas, mostly in France and Flanders. Boulogne, France, was the principle port for embarkation for the wounded and on one occasion it took only nineteen minutes to unload 123 casualties from a train. The main disembarkation points in the UK were Dover and Southampton. During the war years, Dover dealt with 1,260,506 casualties, unloaded 4076 boats and loaded 7781 ambulance trains. The patients were then sent by one of the twenty 'home standard' ambulance trains, or by an emergency ambulance train, to a receiving station, where they were transferred to road vehicles, usually by volunteer first aiders, which took them to their destination hospital. There were 196 receiving stations in the UK including York, where the National Railway Museum, which is hosting the exhibition, is based. Ambulance trains were also used during the Second World War in England and Scotland to transfer the wounded to the many temporary and permanent UK Military Hospitals for further recuperation and treatment. The main train line companies actively helped the Army, Navy, and RAF with supply and conversion of the ambulance trains and during the Second World War this was sanctioned by the Railway Executive Committee. By the time of the Second World War there were about 30 ambulance trains in operation. Each carriage was painted with a red cross on white background on the roof and side so that enemy planes would identify them as hospital trains and not troop or supply trains. Under the Geneva Convention this prevented them becoming a legitimate target. The trains could accommodate about 400 lying and sitting patients, in addition to the medical personnel and train crew . A cup of tea from a nurse was often the first treatment a soldier got as he headed back to Britain . Picture taken in 1918. By the end of the war the trains were a huge part of the war effort and similar trains were employed in the Second World War . The trains often generated their own electricity for lighting and driving overhead fans and all cars were steam heated . The Mayor of Huddersfield and nurses next to an ambulance train during an exhibition at Huddersfield Station, on November 17, 1917 . In a book from the museum's archive, a nurse describes one experience in 'an anonymous diary of nursing sister on western front', as pretty horrendous. She wrote: 'They got their Amiens wounded into cattle trucks on mattresses with convent pillows, and have a twenty hours' journey with them in frightful smells and dirt. They'd been traveling already for two days' The same nurse (not pictured) went on to describe a completely different experience when the trains were fully converted. She said: '(The soldiers) sit up talking and smoking till late, because they are so surprised and pleased to be alive' It's hard to know if you're alive or deadWhen steel and fire go roaring through your head.One moment you'll be crouching at your gunTraversing, mowing heaps down half in fun:The next, you choke and clutch at your right breast -No time to think - leave all - and off you go ...To Treasure Island where the Spice winds blow,To lovely groves of mango, quince and lime -Breathe no good-bye, but ho, for the Red West!It's a queer time.You're charging madly at them yelling ""Fag!""When somehow something gives and your feet drag.You fall and strike your head; yet feel no painAnd find... you're digging tunnels through the hayIn the Big Barn, 'cause it's a rainy day.Oh, springy hay, and lovely beams to climb!You're back in the old sailor suit again.It's a queer time. Or you'll be dozing safe in your dug-out -A great roar - the trench shakes and falls aboutYou're struggling, gasping, struggling, then... hullo!Elsie comes tripping gaily down the trench,Hanky to nose - that lyddite makes a stench -Getting her pinafore all over grime.Funny! because she died ten years ago!It's a queer time.The trouble is, things happen much too quick;Up jump the Boches, rifles thump and click,You stagger, and the whole scene fades away:Even good Christians don't like passing straightFrom Tipperary or their Hymn of HateTo Alleluiah-chanting, and the chimeOf golden harps... and... I'm not well today...It's a queer time. Soldiers standing beside an ambulance train, which were painted with a red cross to prevent them becoming target . Alison Kay, assistant archivist at the National Railway Museum, said: 'With the 2014 centenary approaching, our archive and library collections delve even deeper into the story of the First World War ambulance train to reveal what it would have really been like for patients, doctors and nurses to travel this way during wartime' Miss Kay added: 'Our archives contain drawings of fittings, fixtures and layouts providing an insight into what it would really be like for those who lived on the train day-in, day-out, which is a useful tool when wading through wartime morale-boosting propaganda'","Photos of trains which brought thousands of injured troops back home to go on show at the National Railway Museum .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . In a repeat of the stunt when it launched the first Mustangs 50 years ago, Ford has parked an anniversary model of the car on top of the Empire State Building. To mark the half-century, it seemed only natural to return to New York City, where the car was first revealed at the 1964 World's Fair. Only 1,964 of the limited-edition cars will be released to honor the year when the iconic model was first shown to the public. Scroll down for video . Timeless: Ford's executive chairman Bill Ford poses with the limited edition Mustang at the Empire State Building . Timeless: The first Mustangs were sold in 1965, a year after they appeared at the World's Fair in New York . One of the limited edition Fords, with canary yellow paintwork, was shown off on the observation deck of the Empire State Building. But is wasn't the first time Ford carried out the stunt. It first parked one of its convertibles there in 1965. Getting to the 86th floor was no easy feat, and the car had to be broken into six pieces and carried up the building's elevators in small sections. It was put back together late at night, when the deck was closed to visitors, and it will remain on the viewing deck until Friday. The team tasked with getting the car to the 86th floor faced many challenges, including getting a car that is wider than the original model to fit in the narrow elevators of the Empire State Building. â€˜The Mustang is wider than it was in 1965,â€™ program manager Prakash Pate said. Iconic: A bright yellow version of the anniversary model was parked on the 86th floor of the Empire State Building . Limited edition: Only 1,964 of the cars will be built to mark the year they were first released . To make sure the car would fit, the team . built a mock up of the building's elevators to check that each section . would travel safely to the top. Limited edition versions of the car currently on the observation deck will be among the first built when 2015 Mustang production begins later this year. 'It is an extremely limited edition, . for our most diehard enthusiasts,' the motor company's executive . chairman Bill Ford, whose first car was a green 1975 Mustang, said. 'This . car is important to me, to my family and to everyone at Ford. The . Mustang is a symbol of where Ford has been, and itâ€™s a vision of where . we are going,' he told the Detroit Free Press. Those wanting to own one of the limited editions will be able to chose between one of the two colors of Ford's logo: white or blue. Buyers will also be able to choose a manual or automatic transmission. Stunt: To mark the Mustang's 50th anniversary, Ford returned to New York City where the car was first unveiled .

"By . Dan Bloom . Many people say their commute is like pulling teeth, but Yang Dong has more reason to complain than most. The 20-year-old gripped a rope between his jaws and pulled a van laden with nine adults - while walking on broken glass.

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . Compensation paid to injured and aggrieved teachers has doubled to £40million in four years. The huge total handed out last year included awards made to sacked teachers with weak cases as schools and councils struck deals to avoid costs escalating. Successful personal injury claims include awards of thousands of pounds for stepping into potholes, slipping in wet corridors and tripping on uneven paving slabs. Compensation to injured and aggrieved teachers has doubled to £40million in four years (file picture) The biggest payout – £500,000 – was made to a teacher who hurt her back when the lift she was in at work suddenly plummeted. Figures released by classroom unions this week showed that the NASUWT alone helped its members to £20.7million in 2013 – up 30 per cent in a year – while the Association of Teachers and Lecturers won £5.3million. The National Union of Teachers, which is similar in size to the NASUWT, does not compile total payouts, but the amount secured by all three main teaching unions is thought to exceed £40million.Unions won about £20million for their members in 2009. Most of the compensation was paid out following employment disputes, where teachers claimed they had been wrongly dismissed, discriminated against or otherwise ill-treated by bosses. Much of it came through compromise agreements, which are legal deals that avoid costly tribunals. The agreements prevent employees from pursuing future claims but critics fear they make the likelihood of a payout greater. The figures also raised questions over ‘rewards for failure’. One teacher who was fired for gross misconduct over allegations linked to pupils’ GCSE coursework won £3,000 even though the National Union of Teachers, which represented him, admitted he did not have a strong case. In another case, a deputy head was fired for poor management of special needs provision after Ofsted failed her school. Her claim was settled a day into a tribunal hearing for £16,000. Dia Chakravarty, political director at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Money which could otherwise have been spent on more teachers and classroom equipment is being wasted on compensation claims. Teachers have been awarded compensation for incidents such as slipping on wet floors and tripping on uneven paving slabs . ‘Authorities must do more to ensure taxpayers are not exposed to this endless stream of hefty payouts, particularly at a time when the Department for Education is having to make necessary savings.’ Most personal injury claims related to slips, trips and falls. The £500,000 payout last year was made to a 33-year-old college lecturer from the East Midlands who suffered a back injury when her lift dropped from the mezzanine floor to reception. The figures also provided evidence of devastating injuries inflicted by pupils. An NASUWT member from the South East won compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority worth £91,784 after being punched in the mouth by a teenager. The 59-year-old suffered a broken root on a tooth and developed post-traumatic stress disorder. The NASUWT admitted that in total the cases cost taxpayers millions. Most of the compensation paid out to teachers was following employment disputes (file picture) General secretary Chris Keates said: ‘The tragedy is that in most cases compensation would be unnecessary if employers followed good employment practices and followed health and safety procedures. ‘Instead teachers have their careers, lives and health blighted and millions of pounds of public money has to be spent. Employers flout the law, but it’s the teachers and taxpayers who pay the price.’ She claimed more cases would arise due to moves to deregulate employment laws and health and safety provisions. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said the vast majority of its payouts were linked to members being made redundant rather than leaving due to poor performance.","Claims include stepping in pot holes and slipping in wet corridors .

Passengers got a couple more hours in the Las Vegas sun on Monday thanks to the insects, but not before getting a serious in-flight fright. 'It smelled like the whole cabin was on fire,' passenger Misty Newman told WDIO. Scroll down for video . Bees on a plane: This Dululth-bound Allegiant airlines flight out of Las Vegas was grounded on Monday when a swarm of bees first clouded the windshield before being sucked into the engines . One passenger described the smell that filled the cabin as sulfury. Before the scene became too hellish, pilots turned the plane around and landed safely back at McCarran International Airport. But passengers remained at a loss as to why. At first they were told it was a bird in the engine. 'When we landed the fire department and the cops were waiting and they took off along the runway after us,' Newman said. Not until the frightened flyers were ushered onto a new plane was the true reason behind the grounding revealed. 'We thought [the pilot] was joking when he said ,""I've never had that happen before. We hit thousands of bees,""' passenger Cassandra Rogers told WDIO. The plane taxied into the Duluth airport just two hours behind schedule with no stings reported. 'It smelled like the whole cabin was on fire': Passengers described a burning smell just after takeoff but were initially told the plane had hit a bird. They neither heard nor felt anything while onboard but were quickly grounded when bees were ingested by the engine .","Passengers on the Duluth-bound flight leaving Las Vegas complained of burning smell just after takeoff .

"By . Tamarah Cohen . Campaigners believe that Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (pictured) are described as the 'crack cocaine' of gambling . High street gaming machines that allow punters to stake £100 a spin should be banned, three in four voters believe. Most want an immediate limit on how much can be gambled on roulette-style Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) in bookies’ shops, a poll shows. Nearly half are demanding a total ban on the machines, which have been dubbed the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’ because addicts can lose hundreds of pounds in minutes. In a YouGov poll, 48 per cent said FOBTs should not be permitted in betting shops. Nearly three-quarters (73 per cent) said the £100 maximum stake that can be bet on each spin should be restricted – with 60 per cent of those polled saying it should be slashed to only £2. In what campaigners say is a sign of growing public concern about the misery FOBTs cause, only 6 per cent said the current level at which customers can bet was ‘about right’. The machines, of which there are 33,000 in betting shops across the country, have been blamed for a rise in problem gambling and have also been linked to money laundering. They account for around half of bookmakers’ profits but betting shop managers have anonymously told the Mail of the toll they take on customers and staff. Regular players are ‘like zombies’, the managers said, giving examples of how customers could attack staff and vandalise shops when they lose large amounts of money. The poll, commissioned by the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, comes with David Cameron set to announce new restrictions on betting giants which may include stricter gambling limits and powers for councils to oppose the opening of betting shops. Campaigners have urged Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) to introduce restrictions on the machines . Betting giants wanted to wait until a report at the end of this year, by the industry-funded Responsible Gambling Trust, into the risks posed by gaming machines. But the poll shows six in ten voters want ministers to act now. Only 18 per cent said they believed the Government should wait until the evidence has been assessed. Just 13 per cent felt tighter self-regulation by bookmakers – who have pledged to implement a voluntary code – would be the best way to tackle gambling addiction linked to the machines. The Association of British Bookmakers denies the machines are highly addictive and says the industry is taking measures to counter problem gambling. There are increasing calls to introduce a £2 cap on each game, down from the current maximum stake of £100 . The Campaign for Fairer Gambling said: ‘We have known for some time that FOBTs are a concern for the electorate, but this polling has converted our knowledge into cold hard facts. ‘That 70 per cent want to see these addictive machines curbed is something the Government should not ignore. Support for a £2 cap is also overwhelming. ‘For too long the Government’s excuse has been that there is not enough evidence to enforce restrictions on FOBTs, but this polling has revealed that the public would much rather err on the side of caution. ‘We’re calling on David Cameron to reduce the maximum bet per spin on these machines to £2, removing games like roulette and bringing them into line with all other gambling machines available on the high street – a move we now know the public backs. The Prime Minister has a clear choice: listen to voters or cave in to the bookmakers.’","Campaigners want a £2 limit introduced on slot machines to curb addiction .

"By . Hayley Coyle . You've  probably sung along to Abba’s Dancing Queen a million times. But would you be able to recite the words right now? Apparently not, according to a nationwide poll which found the 1976 classic has the most commonly misheard song lyrics. Nearly a quarter of those surveyed got the words wrong, believing the Swedish quartet are singing about a rather more violent scenario than one usually played out on dance floors. Abba's Dancing Queen is one of the most mistaken lyrics with listeners believing they are singing: 'See the girl, watch her scream, kicking the dancing queen' Even Freddie Mercury is misunderstood with fans singing 'Kicking your cat all over the place' Some of Jon Bon Jovi's fans lose the run of themselves when he is thought to sing 'it doesn't make a difference if we're naked or not' Instead of the correct lyric, ‘See that girl, watch that scene, diggin’ the dancing queen’, they thought Abba sing, ‘See that girl, watch her scream, kicking the dancing queen’. We Will Rock You by Queen was the second most misheard song, with nearly a fifth of respondents thinking lead singer Freddie Mercury says, ‘Kicking your cat all over the place’, rather than, ‘Kicking your can all over the place’. And even with the clue in the title of the Monkees’ 1966 hit I’m A Believer, 12 per cent think the band are singing, ‘Then I saw her face, now I’m gonna leave her’, rather than, ‘now I’m a believer’. Fans regularly re-write the lyrics of their favourite bands - sometimes with hilarious consequences . The poll of 2,000 adults found Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne was the star who is most difficult to understand, with 28 per cent of respondents struggling to make out his words. The study by online streaming service Blinkbox Music also revealed that we are less likely to understand more modern genres of music. Some 56 per cent said fast-paced rap and hip hop songs are the most difficult to understand, while emotive indie-rock songs by bands such as Nirvana came second on 13 per cent. Veteran US singer Madonna is believed to be far more experienced as listeners think she has been 'touched for the thirty-first time' US singer Johnny Nash is believed to have been heartbroken by many listeners as he 'can see clearly now Lorraine has gone' Jimi Hendrix meanwhile has been mistaken as singing 'scuse me while I kiss this guy' Meanwhile 80s group Starship are accused of building this city 'on logs and coal'","Listeners make common mistakes with some of the most popular songs .

"By . Julian Robinson . The red marks left on the wrists of Toni Williams after police handcuffed her. The vulnerable 20-year-old has  autism and the mental capacity of a five-year-old . Police have come under fire for handcuffing a young woman who has autism and the mental capacity of a five-year-old. Toni Williams, 20, was left with bruises on her wrists after officers refused to remove the cuffs. Her mother Leigh Williams insists they should never have handcuffed a vulnerable adult and has now issued a formal complaint against Merseyside Police. Officers were called to their house in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after the 20-year-old became over-excited and bit her mother and hit her. She alerted a social worker, who, together with a community nurse, insisted they call the police. Ms Williams refused to call police herself to deal with her own daughter, but other relatives did. She left the house before they arrived, leaving her relatives with Toni as they waited for officers, and later joined up with her at Arrowe Park Hospital, on the Wirral, Merseyside. She said: 'She kept apologising and asking me to take the handcuffs off - I asked the officers but they kept telling me 'No.' 'They need to be aware and know how to deal with a situation involving a vulnerable adult - they shouldn't have put the handcuffs on in the first place. 'They said Toni had bitten one of the officers, but when we were at the hospital, they wouldn't remove the handcuffs . 'It was as if they thought she was still a danger to them - but she was in the hospital. Some of the bruising on the arms of Toni Williams and who was handcuffed after the autistic 20-year-old became over excited and bit her mother, Leigh. A formal complaint has now been issued against Merseyside Police . 'I explained that she has autism and the mental capacity of a five-year-old but they wouldn't listen. 'The cuffs were cutting into her wrists and she was covered in bruises.' Ms Williams said she had asked officers to move the handcuffs to the front of her daughter's body, which would have allowed her to cuddle her toy dog - which she takes everywhere and allows her to feel safe. The handcuffs were eventually removed after requests from medical staff. The handcuffs were only removed from autistic Toni Williams' wrists after requests from medical staff once the 20-year-old had been taken to Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral . She said: 'I didn't want to call the police, but the social worker and community nurse said we had to. 'There were four officers, one stood in the door and three went into the living room where Toni was - I don't know what happened in there as they wouldn't let my family in. 'Toni was screaming. And when I saw her later, she had a cut on her face and bruises on her arms and on her wrists where the handcuffs had been.' When Leigh Williams called Merseyside Police to complain about the handcuffs placed on her daughter Toni's wrists, she claimed she was asked whether she wanted compensation. The picture shows some of the marks left on 20-year-old Toni's arms after officers handcuffed her . After arriving at hospital to see her daughter - who also suffers with epilepsy and has been having seizures since she was six months old - Ms Williams found she was in a state of anxiety and deeply upset, made worse by the handcuffs. 'When I phoned up to complain they asked if I wanted compensation - it's not about compo, it's about awareness and making sure this doesn't happen to Toni, or anyone else again. 'I've promised her it won't happen again and I have to keep that promise. I have to protect my little girl.' Ms Williams, who moved back to her hometown two years ago to be near the support of her family and friends, said she had lost respect for the police. She added: 'This is an injustice - you are meant to turn to the police for support.' More than 700 people have joined a Facebook group set up by Ms Williams, calling for more awareness of autism. She has also gathered the support of Birkenhead MP Frank Field, who has written to the police on her behalf demanding that reports be released. The distressed mum added: 'Officers need to be trained properly to deal with vulnerable adults and need to assess the situation properly. 'I still don't know what went on in the living room that day - I just want to know what happened.' A spokesman for Merseyside Police confirmed a complaint had been made in relation to the arrest. He said: 'The force takes all complaints seriously and investigates them thoroughly and to the highest standard. 'As this complaint is currently under investigation, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.'","Autistic Toni Williams became over excited and hit and bit her mother .

"Police were not called and did not become involved in the incident . By . Amanda Williams . Jack Mackay, 11, came to the rescue when the rampaging dog slipped its lead and went 'berserk' in a South London street . A young boy had a four centimetre hole bitten out of his face by a rampaging dog after he tried to save his mother and baby brother from being mauled. Jack Mackay, 11, came to the rescue when the rampaging dog slipped its lead and went 'berserk' in a South London street where around 30 children were playing in their Easter school holiday. The bull mastiff type dog was trying to jump at Jack's mother, Lucy Farlam, and his eight month old baby brother Jacob, when the owner, from Eltham, warned them not to 'scream or shout', because the dog would attack. Desperate to get the crazed animal away from his family, Jack screamed at the dog to distract it. Describing the horrific attack, Ms Farlam, 29, said: 'I was holding my eight-month-old baby Jacob and it was jumping up at me to get to him, biting at my side. 'I kicked the dog off of me to save my baby. His owner was shouting 'don't scream or shout because the dog doesn't like it'. 'So, to get the dog off me and my baby, Jack screamed so the dog charged at him instead. 'It had him on the floor and starting biting at his face and arm.' Father Martin Mackay rushed to his son's aid, 'rugby tackling' the crazed animal which then charged at Ms Farlam and her child again, chasing her into a neighbour's hallway before it was finally brought under control. Ms Farlam added: 'They were intense bites Jack had on him. It had bitten a hole into his face so the flesh was missing. 'The dog was trying to get his neck to kill him.

"By . Tara Brady . Sergio Novarette, 27, originally from Mexico, has been jailed for 26 years . An illegal immigrant murdered his pregnant girlfriend before writing ‘die b***h’ above her head after she told him to leave their home, a court heard yesterday. Violent Sergio Novarette, 27, originally from Mexico, battered Sarah O’Neill when she demanded he was gone by the morning after their relationship broke down. His visa had run out and he was in the country illegally. When Sarah told him it was over he beat, strangled and raped her. Mother-of-one Sarah, 22, suffered serious head injuries, including fractures to her jaw and eye sockets and was left sprawled in a pool of her own blood. She was found on the bed of the flat the couple shared in Speedwell, Bristol, with the words 'morir perra' - die b***h in Spanish - written above her. Yesterday, Novarette was jailed for 26 years after pleading guilty to the murder which happened on January 8. Mr Justice Blake dubbed the killer an 'obsessive, jealous and violent' at Bristol Crown Court. He said: 'You remained in the premises and behaved in an obsessive, jealous, violent and obstructive manner, even though you know Miss O’Neill wanted you to leave. 'You exploited her generosity and hospitality and horribly used it and affection against her. 'The evil language you used and the words you scrawled on the bedside above her broken and battered body are a testament to you behaviour at the time.' The court heard Novarette first arrived in the UK on a six month visitors visa in December 2012. Despite his time having run out, he remained in the UK where he met Sarah during a busker’s event in Bristol’s Bear Pit, in July 2013. Sarah O'Neill, 22, suffered serious head injuries, including fractures to her jaw and eye sockets . The pair quickly struck up a relationship and he moved in with the pretty brunette not long after. However, violence quickly began to emerge in the relationship and alcoholic Novarette left Sarah with a number of cuts and bruises. Sarah, 22, suffered serious head injuries, including fractures to her jaw and eye sockets and was left sprawled in a pool of her own blood . The court heard Sarah told a number of friends their relationship was over towards the end of 2013, but she did not want to kick him out as he had no where to go. Adam Vaitilingam, prosecuting, said: 'A neighbour, Lorna Johnson, recalls visiting Sarah sometime before Christmas 2013 following reports of screaming coming from the flat. 'She said Sarah was crying and had purple bruises around her throat. She told her something had happened the previous evening but did not say what. 'On another occasion the defendant also admitted pushing Sarah over, causing large purple bruises, when it was witnessed by a friend. 'Sarah told friends the defendant would also have sex with her even when she told him no. 'Sarah’s friends knew she wanted the relationship over and wanted him to leave her, but the defendant had stayed at the flat because she did not want to ""just kick him out on the street'. 'She told another friend Novarette had been violent towards her, and was obviously desperate for the defendant to leave and was very scared of him.' The couple finally came to blows after Sarah revealed she was in the early stages of pregnancy but did not want to keep the baby because of his violent nature. Police search Rose Green Close in Speedwell in Bristol where they found Sarah O¿Neill who was murdered by her boyfriend . On January 7, the day before her murder, Sarah was staying at a friend’s when Novarette, who had been out drinking all day, sent a series of text messages calling her a 'baby killer' and a 'f***king whore'. In response Sarah told Novarette to pack his things and leave by the morning, before leaving her friend’s house at 12.30am to 'sort things out' with him. Her last text message to the friend, at 3.20am, confirmed that Novarette had agreed to leave the following morning and all was okay. But, less than eight hours later, Novarette, who had a more than 350mg of alcohol in his blood at the time of his arrest, telephoned police to reveal his violent crime. Scene: Police search Rose Green Close, in Speedwell in Bristol where the body of Sarah O'Neill was found . Mr Vaitilingam added: 'She was clothed from the waist up but her upper clothing was pushed up exposing both of her breasts. 'Blood was smeared all over her body and she was pronounced dead at the scene. The words ‘die bitch’ were written in Spanish in red ink on the head board of the bed. 'The defendant accepted it was his writing, he had clearly written it that night.' Hours after the horrific attack, drunken Novarette rang a friend to tell him he had 'gone too far' and 'crossed the line' before calling police to confess his crime. When officers arrived he told them 'I choked her' and later asked, 'how long do you get for murder?' when he arrived at the station. Richard Smith QC, defending, said his client had a serious problem with alcohol and had drunk a 'huge amount even by his own standards of drinking' on the night of the murder. The flats cordoned off in Rose Green Close, Speedwell in Bristol where the body of young mum Sarah O'Neill (22) was found . He also said Novarette told officer he had taken ketamine, although no evidence was found, which could have caused him to make a 'terrible' misjudgement of people. When he was arrested the following morning he was four-and-a-half times the drink drive limit. He had also taken horse tranquilliser Ketamine and only called police when still under the influence of the drug. Sarah also miscarried as she died in a pool of blood, the court heard. The court heard that Novarette had sex with her either at the time of death or shortly afterwards before leaving her body in the bedroom. When Sergio Novarette was arrested the following morning he was four-and-a-half times the drink drive limit . Sarah O'Neill was found on the bed in the flat the couple shared in Speedwell, Bristol, with the words 'die b***h' abover her head . The killer was living in the UK illegally after coming to the country from Mexico in December 2012 and had a long history of alcoholism. Caring Sarah had taken him in as he was unable to earn money legally. She had a 21-month-old son by a former partner and fell pregnant again by Novarette in late 2013. In a victim impact statement read out in court, Sarah’s mother Vivian O’Neill said: 'At a time like this words are hard to find. 'We are heartbroken and devastated at the loss of Sarah. I am taking medication for the grief and anxiety.' Mr Justice Blake said Novarette will face deportation to Mexico. Police search around the flats in Bristol where the body of Sarah O'Neill was found dead . The pair quickly struck up a relationship and he moved in with the pretty brunette not long after . He said: 'Sarah was attractive, loving and generous, a free spirit who was accepting of all people. 'She had a warm relationship with her family.' Detective Inspector Julie Mackay said: 'The attack on Sarah was a savage one which left her with horrific injuries. 'It was the worst kind of betrayal from a man who out of kindness she continued to allow to share her home despite them recently separating. 'Sarah’s murder has torn her family apart and I know that it will take them a long, long time to adjust to a life without Sarah in it. 'I hope that the significant sentence handed to Novarette gives them some comfort and helps them to continue rebuilding their lives.'","Sergio Novarette, 27, beat and strangled girlfriend Sarah O'Neill, 22 .

"By . Julian Robinson . Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, pictured arriving for an earlier court hearing at Brighton Magistrates' in March. She has now been cleared of two charges relating to the anti-fracking protests outside energy firm Cuadrilla's exploratory oil drilling site on the outskirts of Balcombe on August 19 2013 . Britain’s only Green MP has vowed to continue her fight to end fracking after being cleared of obstructing a public highway and a public order offence during high-profile protests. The Brighton Pavilion MP was arrested outside energy company Cuadrilla’s exploratory oil drilling site in Balcombe, West Sussex, last August 19. She was among a group of protesters who had linked arms outside the site, which had become a national focal point for anti-fracking protests. During the trial at Brighton Magistrates’ Court alongside four co-defendants, Lucas, 53, said she 'wanted to express solidarity' by protesting peacefully. She was found not guilty of the two charges she faced - willful obstruction of a public highway and breaching an order under Section 14 of the Public Order Act. Outside court, she said: 'We are pleased that the court upheld our right to peacefully protest against fracking, but this judgment is not a victory or cause for celebration. 'We will continue to campaign to end fracking and only celebrate when our world is on the path to a clean energy future.' Ms Lucas’s co-defendants - Josef Dobraszczyk, 22, from Bristol; Ruth Jarman, 50, from Hook, Hampshire; Sheila Menon, 42, from north east London; and Ruth Potts, 39, from Totnes, Devon - were also cleared of both charges. Ms Lucas told the trial she felt it was important to protest about fracking in a bid to prevent the UK being locked into using more fossil fuels. She said:'I’m haunted by the idea that my children and my children’s children will turn round to me and say, ""What did you do about this overwhelming threat?"" Caroline Lucas was arrested on the same day that activists linked arms to resist police officers as they cleared the road outside the main entrance to the Cuadrilla exploratory drilling site in Balcombe, West Sussex. It came as part of  anti fracking demonstrations which inclided two days of 'mass civil disobedience' 'And I want to do all I can do peacefully to address that before it’s too late.' Ms Lucas told the trial that governments were failing to urgently address the issues surrounding climate change. And she said she felt the protest outside Cuadrilla’s main entrance was a 'legitimate' and 'appropriate' way of sending a message to the Government about fracking concerns. Although Cuadrilla did not frack at the site, its drilling operation sparked concerns that it would go on to do so in the future. Prosecutor Jonathan Edwards told the trial that a large camp formed near the site’s entrance and extra officers were drafted in because of the vast number of protesters. A notice under Section 14 of the Public Order Act was imposed, requiring demonstrators to use a designated protest area away from Cuadrilla’s entrance. Police remove a protester from the entrance of the Cuadrilla Resources site in Balcombe, West Sussex, on August 19 last year - the same day that MP Caroline Lucas was arrested . During the protests police had to escort a tanker in to the test drill site operated by energy firm Cuadrilla, near Balcombe, West Sussex . Ms Lucas told the trial it felt important and 'symbolic' to be based outside the main gate during the protest, which lasted about five hours from around 10.15am. Giving evidence, she denied being told of a designated protest area by police, adding: 'I couldn’t see any reason why we couldn’t continue our peaceful protest.' PC Robert Staplehurst, of Sussex Police, told the court he approached Ms Lucas, said there was a Section 14 notice and asked whether there was anything he could say to move her. Ms Lucas - who was elected as the Green Party’s first MP in the 2010 general election - replied no and was arrested. She went on: 'If we had another 10 to 15 minutes we could have come to an agreement to end it and dispersed. We weren’t doing anything different than we were in the previous five hours.' Explaining . how he reached his verdicts, district judge Tim Pattinson said the . prosecution had failed to satisfy him that Ms Lucas had 'the requisite . knowledge' about the Section 14 order being in place. 'All . the defendants said that they would have moved if it had been necessary . to permit access to emergency vehicles. None of these defendants was . ‘locked on’ to each other or to any object.' Environmental activists locked themselves together at the main entrance to the Cuadrilla exploratory drilling site as part of the demonstrations in August . Hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - involves high pressure liquid being pumped deep underground to split shale rock and release oil or gas supplies. Fears have been raised over the potential for small-scale earthquakes and water pollution, and that a drive to exploit new gas reserves will turn the focus away from efforts to develop a low-carbon economy to tackle climate change. Cuadrilla drilled horizontally for some 1,700ft through Micrite formation, a type of limestone, at a depth of around 2,350ft below ground level. But later its chief executive Francis Egan said the rock underneath the drill site, at Lower Stumble, was already naturally fractured, and the company had no intention of fracking there. The cost of policing the lengthy protests at Balcombe was nearly £4 million, prompting Sussex police and crime commissioner Katy Bourne to seek financial aid from the Home Office.","Caroline Lucas cleared of two charges after arrest in West Sussex last year .

A 19-year-old girl has been left scarred for life after ‘high-strength cleaning fluid' was thrown in her face in a ‘targeted attack’ as she answered the door in a quiet residential street. Vikki Horsman suffered horrific burns to her face, neck and chest and internal injuries to her throat and lungs when the toxic liquid was hurled at her in the horror daylight attack. Six people have been arrested in connection with the incident after the teenager was doused in the substance as she answered the door at her friend's house in Tividale, West Midlands, on Tuesday afternoon. The teenager was pictured on her Facebook page in a variety of poses, including wearing a headscarf. Police said they were no initial indications of a religious or racial motives but had not ruled out any lines on inquiry.

Miss Horsman, 19, has been left scarred for life after 'high-strength cleaning fluid' was thrown in her face in a 'targeted attack' as she answered the door at her friend's house  in a quiet residential street on Tuesday . The shocking attack occurred when the teenager answered the door at her friends house in Tividale, West Midlands, at around 3pm on Tuesday afternoon . Police have cordoned off the property in Tividale, West Midlands, while investigations into the circumstances surrounding the attack are carried out . Miss Horsman, who lives five miles away from where the attack occurred, was taken to hospital with 25 per cent degree burns as well as internal injuries to her throat and lungs. A man in his 60s, who answered the door with the teenager, also suffered minor burn injuries in the assault. Miss Horsman’s uncle, Paul, described the harrowing incident as a shock. The 47-year-old of Oldbury, West Midlands, said: ‘It's been a real shock to everyone and we're just thinking about Vikki now.' West Midlands Police said four men and two women had today been detained by officers investigating the incident. A . police spokesman confirmed that three of those arrested were held on . suspicion of wounding, one on suspicion of conspiracy to wound, and two . others on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice.

Miss Horsman's uncle, Paul, described the incident as a shock. He said: 'It's been a real shock to everyone and we're just thinking about Vikki now' Detective Inspector Jim Munro, investigating officer in the case, said: 'We believe this was a targeted attack' Detective Inspector Jim Munro, investigating officer in the case, said: 'We believe this was a targeted attack. ‘It's not clear what the substance is yet but initial thoughts are that it's some kind of high-strength detergent. ‘An investigation is underway to try and establish a motive for the attack.’ Officers earlier said they believed the teenager was deliberately targeted and ruled out a case of mistaken identity. Kirstie Bennett, who lives across the road from Kerry Stevens' house where the incident occurred, said: 'I can't imagine why anyone would want to do this to anyone let alone a young woman. 'I don't know Vikki but she's a pretty girl. I think she was a friend of Kerry's. ‘It's horrific to think her life has been changed forever. ‘I heard something had happened here on the news and I told my mum to stay in the house. ‘I haven't spoken to Kerry since, but I know it must have been Vikki as her car is still there.’ Another neighbour said: ‘It's a shock - you don't expect anything like that to happen round here. ‘This is a quiet street, lots of families, nothing ever goes on.’ West Midlands Police said officers were yet to establish a motive for the attack on 19-year-old Vikki Horsman .

Detectives are investigating the incident which occurred in a quiet residential street in Tividale, West Midlands . Another, who gave her name as Claire, said: ‘I think there was another man stood behind her, I think he was hit by some of the stuff. ‘The family who live there don't have much to do with the rest of the street, they keep themselves to themselves. ‘The first I knew of it was when the police arrived.’ The £115,000 terraced house was still cordoned off yesterday morning with the front door and porch covered in a large blue sheet. Neighbour Gillian Smith, 58, said: ‘I just can't imagine the pain this girl must have gone though. ‘I am praying that she makes a full recovery.’ A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: ‘We were called at 3pm to MacDonald Close in Tividale on April 15. ‘A woman was found with 25 per cent partial thickness burns to her face, neck, chest and arms. ‘Her burns were treated with dressing before she was taken to hospital. ‘There was a second patient who was a man with less serious burns to his head and chest, he was also taken to the same hospital. ‘At the scene were two ambulances and one paramedic car.’ Acid attack victim: Katie Piper . In March 2008, Katie Piper's life changed for ever when she became the victim of a horrific acid attack as she walked along a busy London road. The former television presenter and model was just 24-years-old when she met a man over the internet who eventually ordered an accomplice to throw sulphuric acid in her face. Daniel Lynch, a martial arts enthusiast, gave Miss Piper's details to Stefan Sylvestre who threw sulphuric acid in her face on a busy London road in March 2008. Miss Piper suffered serious burns to her face and chest in the attack and was left blinded in one eye. She has since had skin grafts and an operation to restore her vision. The attack was caught on CCTV and both Lynch and Sylvestre were later arrested and jailed. Lynch was handed two life sentences, and will serve a minimum of 16 years, and Sylvestre received a life sentence and will spend a minimum of 12 years in prison. Another woman to be targeted in an acid attack is Naomi Oni. In December 2012 Victoria's Secret . worker Naomi, 21, was left scarred for life after Mary Konye doused . her with concentrated sulphuric acid. Konye . disguised herself in a Muslim veil to stalk her friend - who she was . jealous of - as she left the Victoria's Secret store in Westfield . shopping centre in Stratford, east London, where she worked. Victoria's Secret worker Naomi Oni, 21, pictured, was left scarred for life after Mary Konye doused her with concentrated sulphuric acid . Shortly before Miss Oni reached her home in Dagenham, Essex, Konye hurled acid at her victim's face. Miss . Oni suffered serious burns to her face and chest, lost her hair and . eyelashes, and required skin graft surgery to cover the burns. Konye was convicted of the attack and was jailed for 12 years at London's Snaresbrook Crown Court last month.

Mr Mitchell voiced growing fears in Labour ranks that Mr Miliband has been unable to translate four years of political thinking into policies that can be sold on the doorstep.

"By . Emily Kent Smith . A secretive hen scampered through hedges and undergrowth to find a hidden location 500 yards from her coop to lay her eggs. The bantam hen, named Raindrop, spent the past five weeks wandering out of her pen and for every day she escaped she laid an egg in the nest. But little did Raindrop's owners know that the hen had been sneaking through a gap in a hedge to a private nest 500 yards from her house. The sneaky hen had been escaping to a secret location to lay her 37 eggs. Sandra Palmer's son James Palmer-Snellin pictured holding Raindrop at the farm. Sandra Palmer only discovered the large pile of eggs stacked under a tree, when she noticed the bird was missing one day and went looking for her. She soon spotted two-year-old Raindrop on top of the stack. After laying more than three dozen eggs, the hen tried to nest the haul in the hope that they would hatch. But because they were left out in the cold, none hatched. Mrs Palmer, 50, co-owner of Farmer Palmer's children's activity farm near Poole, Dorset, said she was 'gobsmacked'. Raindrop is pictured checking the spot where she lay her eggs. Sadly, all of the eggs were cold and were unable to be saved . Raindrop was spotted emerging from the hedge through which she was making her escape. Owner Sandra Palmer said: 'She must have got out through a hole in the hedge that we hadn't noticed' She said: 'We have 10 hens and a cockerel who live together, but when we went to check on them one morning, Raindrop was missing. 'She must have got out through a hole in the hedge that we hadn't noticed. 'I went looking for her and found her under a tree in a field about 500 yards away. 'I was absolutely gobsmacked because she was sitting on top of 37 eggs, I couldn't believe it. 'Chickens lay around one egg per day, so we think she had been sneaking off to the tree and laying an egg for the last 37 days. 'It's her . first year of laying and was obviously feeling broody, and by sitting on . the eggs to incubate them she was hoping they would hatch. 'But the eggs need to be kept warm at all times for that to happen and when we felt them, they were stone cold. 'Sadly, . we weren't able to eat them because we couldn't be sure how long they . had been there and so we left them out for the magpies to eat.

"By . Martin Robinson . The Co-op Group has today revealed catastrophic losses of £2.5billion for the past year. Acting chief executive Richard Pennycook made a stark warning about the mutual's future and admitted: '2013 was a disastrous year, the worst in our 150-year history'. He added: 'This is a wake-up call that the Co-op does not have a God-given right to exist.' The monumental losses follow the near-collapse of its banking arm, which had a £1.5billion black hole in its finances and nearly sank the whole group, which employs 90,000 staff in the UK. It came a day after the Co-op Bank's former chairman Reverend Paul Flowers was charged with drugs offences. Scroll down for video . In trouble: The Co-op group, which owns 30 per cent of the ailing Co-op Bank, has posted losses of £2.5billion - branded the worst year in its 150-year history . The group's losses were £2.5billion in the last year, up from £529million in 2012. Last month chief executive Euan Sutherland quit the vast group, which has funeral, pharmacy, insurance, banking and a supermarket among its businesses, calling it a 'ungovernable'. His acting replacement Richard Pennycook said as he revealed the vast losses: 'Today’s results demonstrate that but . they also highlight fundamental failings in management and governance at . the Group over many years. 'These results should serve as a wake-up call . to anyone who doubts just how serious the challenges we face are'. Former City minister Lord Myners, who . resigned from the group's board last week, has blamed former managers 'who were allowed to run amok . like kids in a sweet shop'. He was brought in to draw up proposals for a . major overhaul of the business, but this was rejected. They may now be pushed through next month. 'They bought up . businesses willy-nilly - from Britannia Building Society to Somerfield . supermarkets - and made catastrophically inept decisions over and over . again. In the process they crippled the group with huge debt,' he said in the Daily Mirror. Criticism: Experts have said the group, which includes the supermarket, is too big to led to safety by the current management . The bulk of the losses relate to the crisis that engulfed the Co-op's banking arm when a £1.5 billion hole was discovered in its finances, following its ill-fated purchase of the Britannia building society and attempts to buy more than 600 Lloyds branches. 'Like kids in a sweet shop': Lord Myners blames former managers for the mutual's current woes . A rescue deal means the majority of the bank is now owned by bondholders though the Co-op group remains the largest single shareholder with 30 per cent. But this stake may be further diluted after it said in today's statement that it had still not decided whether to take part in a £400 million rights issue after the lender said it needed to find more cash than previously thought. The group said the cash call was an 'opportunity, not an obligation' and that it would 'consider the full details of the issue in due course'. It will add to speculation about the possibility of the size of the group's holding in the bank falling to such a low level that it may not be able to continue operating under the Co-operative brand. Roger Barker, director of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors said: 'The Co-operative Group’s problems have not arisen because Co-op is a mutual organisation. They have arisen because Co-op has weak corporate governance. 'Without major changes to its governance model, the Co-operative Group will struggle to survive over the medium term. This is a huge concern for the 90,000 people employed by the Group'. One of its former bosses, disgraced reverend Paul Flowers, was yesterday charged with three drugs offences. The man dubbed the ‘Crystal Methodist', is accused of possession of Class A drugs cocaine and methamphetamine as well as the Class C drug ketamine. Arriving at a police station to answer bail, he told the assembled reporters and photographers that they were ‘vultures’. But said the exception was the BBC – which had always been ‘really nice’ to him. On bail: Reverend Flowers arrives at a Leed police station flanked by minders as he was charged with drugs offences today . Former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers laughs as he tries out an exercise bike . Anger: Flowers called waiting journalists 'vultures' but said the BBC had been 'very nice' since the scandal broke last year . Today's figures showed the Co-op's vast debt pile, built up during an acquisition spree which included the Somerfield supermarket chain, stood at £1.4 billion. This was down from £1.7billion in 2012, but comes as lenders are reported to be increasingly troubled by the run of boardroom disputes hampering plans to shake up the group's corporate structure. Bitter resistance to the planned changes saw chief executive Euan Sutherland step down last month while former . City minister Lord Myners, architect of the reforms, will also leave after putting them to a members' vote in May. Group chair Ursula Lidbetter used today's results announcement to stress the urgent need for change. 'During 2013, it became apparent that our governance had fallen far short of the standards to which we aspire as a co-operative society. 'Now is the time to put that right through fundamental reform - we have to act with urgency if we are to lay the foundations for a stronger, healthier co-operative business in the future.'","Acting chief executive believes 'disastrous' 2013 is 'worst in our history'

"By . Daniel Martin . Everyone approaching retirement will be told when they are expected to die, ministers have said. Life expectancy is measured by linking factors such as smoking, eating habits and socio-economic background. The Government-backed guidance came as figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed a growing life expectancy gap between North and South. Everyone approaching retirement will be told when they are expected to die, ministers have said. The Government-backed guidance came as figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed a growing life expectancy gap between North and South . Life expectancy at age 65 was highest for men in Harrow, where they could expect to live for a further 20.9 years compared with only 14.9 years for men in Glasgow City. For women at age 65, life expectancy was highest in Camden (23.8 years) and lowest in Glasgow City (18.3 years). Average male life expectancy in the UK is now 78.9 years. The coast of Dorset is the longevity capital of Britain, with girls born in the Purbeck area expected to live to 86.6 years. The neighbouring district of East Dorset has the highest male life expectancy at 82.9 years. Mr Webb said insurance companies already had some of the mechanisms to calculate the figure using information such as postcodes, lifestyle choices like smoking and hereditary factors . The guidance is designed to help pensioners plan how much to spend and save. Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, . said retirees need to gain a sense of how long they might live to help . make such financial decisions. He . said many people underestimate how long they will live. ‘If you are . thinking about this, what do you do? For best guidance you probably . think about how long your grandparents lived. But that is two . generations out of date.’ The . minister is asking pension providers to give people an estimate as part . of guidance which will be rolled out in April next year. The . advice is linked to major pension reforms, announced in the Budget, . which will allow people to draw down their money at any time, instead of . seeing it tied up in annuities. That . led to warnings that people might be reckless, blowing their pension . pots on expensive items instead of saving sensibly to last them . throughout retirement. At . the time Mr Webb hit back, saying he was ‘relaxed’ if people wanted to . buy Italian Lamborghini sports cars because that was their ‘choice’. Mr Webb said for most people, their life expectancy will be 'much longer than they think' But the Government also admitted that ‘consumers need to be able to make informed decisions’. It . is therefore guaranteeing ‘free, impartial face-to-face guidance’ for . individuals reaching retirement through a new ‘duty’ on pension . providers to deliver the advice. Mr Webb said the type of questions that would be covered included asking people about their household, such as whether they have a spouse, what might happen if they died and if they had thought about residential care. But life expectancy also had to be part of that consultation. Mr Webb said insurance companies already had some of the mechanisms to calculate the figure using information such as postcodes, lifestyle choices like smoking and hereditary factors. ‘It is an average,’ added Mr Webb. ‘But for most people it will probably be longer than they think.’ Figures from the ONS show the North-South divide in life expectancy is widening because of the migration of young people with healthy lifestyles to the south-east. Ambitious young and fit people are increasingly being drawn away from northern areas in search of higher paid jobs around London, according to the ONS. Overall life expectancy is rising steadily across Britain – with women now projected to live to 82.7 years – a year longer than they were only four years ago. Although men are still behind women, they are narrowing the gap rapidly, gaining almost 17 months in the last four years alone. Noting how death rates are higher in northern England than the south, the ONS report said: ‘A number of factors have been identified as plausibly being responsible for the excess mortality in the northern regions of England. ‘These include socioeconomic, environmental, educational, lifestyle factors, which may act over the whole life course, and possibly over generations.’ It added: ‘One factor that has received less attention is the selective migration of healthy individuals from poorer health areas into better health areas or vice versa.’ Neil Duncan-Jordan of the National Pensioners Convention told The Mirror: 'I think people will either laugh at this idea or be very upset by it. It’s crude, blunt and a bit gimmicky. 'If you were told you were going to live to 98, you’d probably think, ‘That’s all right’, but if you only made it to 78, you’d be upset.”","New government guidance tells pensioners how long left they have to live .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . This hot cross bun looks good enough to eat but taking a bite could spoil your Easter -  as it's 207 years old. Andrew and Dot Munson keep the archaic bun in a cardboard box at their house near Colchester in Essex. The treat, which represents the Crucifixion and is traditionally eaten on Good Friday, was given to them by a neighbour 30 years ago. But a distinguished historian has uncovered evidence which suggests it was baked in 1807 and belonged to a medical practitioner by the name of Edward Holdich. Ancient snack: The world's oldest hot cross bun's history has been traced back more than two centuries . If true, it would be the world’s oldest hot cross bun, dating back to the year the slave trade was abolished throughout the British Empire. ‘I think it’s a miracle it never went mouldy or fell apart in all these years,’ said Mr Munson, 75, from Wormingford. ‘You couldn’t eat it though as it is rock hard - like a ball of concrete.’ The retired electrician was handed the seemingly indestructible bun in the 1980s by a grateful neighbour, Norman Baker, after he did some work at his home. ‘I really didn’t know what it was when he gave it to me. He told me his great uncle had put it in that box so I just decided to keep it,’ he added. The relic’s provenance was investigated by Andrew Phillips, a Visiting Fellow in the Department of History at the University of Essex. The owner, a retired electrician, was handed the seemingly indestructible bun in the 1980s by a grateful neighbour . He discovered Mr Holdich was a fairly wealthy man who had a son by the same name. Edward jnr married the daughter of a farmer called Baker but had no children. The beneficiary of his will was a nephew called Harry Baker, from Sudbury, Suffolk, who died in 1943 when it passed to accountant Norman Baker - Mr Munson’s neighbour. Hot cross buns are said to date back to the 12th century but were first mentioned in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1733. The . cross on the top is supposed to signify the means by which Christ was . crucified, the bread represents his body and the spices refer to the . cloth saturated with spices that was wrapped around him after his death. They were often kept as they were said to bring good luck and health. The clincher was an old, brown envelope that is still kept with the bun and which states it was baked in Weir Street, Colchester in 1807. Mr Phillips said: ‘The handwriting fits the date given as it is written with a quill pen and is in regency style, which preceded the copperplate of the Victorian era. ‘The spelling of Weir Street - now spelt Wyre Street - was common at the time. ‘The hot cross bun also seems genuine as it is a bread roll with a cross incised on the top, rather than pastry filled with sultanas, which came later. ‘It has been an intriguing story and, despite its long history, this bun has only ever travelled a few miles from where it was originally baked.’ Mr Munson added: ‘It stays in a drawer throughout the year to protect it from sunlight but I get it out if anyone asks about it. ‘It’s an odd thing to have but it’s definitely a talking point at Easter.’","The bun was given to a Colchester couple 30 years ago as a gift .

A 58-year-old woman and a 62-year-old man in the Land Rover were also critically injured in the incident but survived. Ms Yilmaz had been pictured sitting inside the car in images she had posted on Facebook shortly before her death. The family, originally from Turkey before settling in Dortmund, Germany, said they had been left devastated at the news. Her mother said: 'She was still so young. It is really difficult for my husband and I to come to terms with her death and to live with it.' She said her daughter had just qualified and earned herself a job as a kindergarten teacher, and was apparently on the way home when the tragedy happened on February 17. A police investigation discovered Ms Yilmaz received a message on her mobile phone at 1.10pm. Police said it was a private message over the WhatsApp service. Ms Yilmaz died after veering across the B54 at Herdecke in North Rhine Westphalia, colliding head first into a Land Rover coming the other way . A 58-year-old woman and a 62-year-old man in the Land Rover were also critically injured in the incident but survived . According to the police report, she was apparently reading the message at the time she crashed head-on into the other vehicle. Officers believe she had not noticed the road curved at that point as she was distracted by the message. The police report was handed to prosecutor Beatriz Foehring, 44, who said: 'Based on all the evidence we have concluded that she was distracted by her mobile telephone. It was a tragic accident.' Police spokesman Martin Pollmann, 50, added: 'I can imagine it was only a second or two in which she glanced at the mobile telephone, and at which point she was effectively driving blind at 80 kilometres an hour for about 45 seconds. It was enough to cause a disaster.' The young girl's body meanwhile has been flown by her parents back to Turkey where it was buried in the Turkish city of Macka.

"By . Emily Kent Smith . A mother stole from a disabled man as he lay unconscious on the floor of a supermarket after suffering from a seizure. Sentencing magistrates labelled the woman who stole the £500 Sony Xperia mobile phone 'despicable'. But despite blasting her behaviour, Emma Woods, 27, from Nelson Lancashire, walked free from court yesterday. Emma Woods (L) stole from Andrew Moulding (R) as he lay unconscious in a supermarket in Colne, Lancashire. She then took his phone and glasses telling staff that she would return the belongings to his father's home . Burnley Magistrates heard that victim Andrew Moulding, 46, had been at his best friend’s funeral before the crime. It was the first time the vulnerable father had left his house after an initial stroke eight months ago. Mr Moulding described the theft, which happened as he had lay unconscious, as 'morbid'. The court heard that after attending his friend's wake he went into his local Tesco in Colne, Lancashire to buy some food for his dog but while he was in the shop, he suffered another seizure. Woods then took off Mr Moulding's glasses and stole the mobile phone from his pocket. She told staff that she knew the victim’s family and would return his belongings. Emma Woods walked free with a £400 but she was warned by magistrates that she could face a prison sentence if she committed any further offences . The court heard that Woods then took the glasses to Mr Moulding's father’s house but failed to tell him about the mobile phone. After the callous robbery, Mr Moulding, a former joiner, was taken to the Royal Blackburn Hospital where he remained for two days. It was only when he had started recovering from the stroke that he realised his mobile was missing. Andrew Robinson, prosecuting, said that Mr Moulding had entered the shop at around 8pm on September 5 last year. Mr Robinson said: 'His eyes began to blur and his next recollection was him waking up in Blackburn Hospital on a drip. 'He . was discharged on September 7 and queried where his glasses and mobile . phone were and was told the property had been handed back to his father. 'Emma Woods had attended his [father's] home address and handed him his glasses but not the mobile. Andrew Moulding said of Woods: 'She's picked on me whilst I was unconscious, it was very brazen of her. I could have been dead but even then I don¿t think that would have stopped her. I was literally on the floor' 'CCTV . showed her in the store removing his glasses and mobile . phone, looking at it and scrolling through it. 'She said she would . return them to his father, that wasn’t done.' In a . victim impact statement read in court, Mr Moulding said: 'It was the . first time in eight months I had been out, I am disabled after my first . stroke and I was met with sickening behaviour. 'I . can not believe it, I felt disgusted, violated and stripped of my . dignity knowing someone had been going through my pockets when I was at . my most vulnerable. 'She used my glasses as a front to keep my phone. I could have been dead on the floor, it wouldn’t have stopped her.' He added that by taking his phone, she also took away sentimental photos, personal and important data, hospital appointments and music from him - all of which caused him 'unnecessary stress and inconvenience'. He added: 'What gives her the right to go through my pockets? It is disgusting behaviour.' Laura Heywood, who represented Woods in court said that the mother had been drinking and went to Tesco to buy some cigarettes. Woods walked free from court yesterday. She was handed fines of £499 . Miss Heywood said: 'She failed to return the phone, she can’t offer any explanation why she did that. She accepts responsibility for not returning the mobile phone.' The court heard that Woods had been hauled before the courts in 2009  and had been sent to prison in 2010 for breaching a suspended sentence. Chairman of the bench Jack Paley sentencing said: 'It was indeed a despicable act. 'We sentence you to 20 weeks, however we suspended it for 12 months so you are not going down the steps today, but you were very close. 'You are a very lucky lady.' Woods has been handed a 12-month supervision period as well as a community order. She will also be given help for her drinking which Mr Paley said would 'hopefully help you in the future and stop you re-offending'. She was also ordered to pay £499. He added: 'The next 12 months if you do anything wrong I can guarantee you will not be walking out.' Speaking after the case, Mr Moulding described Woods as 'scum of the earth'. He said: 'Eight months before this happened I had a stroke and hadn’t moved out of the house. 'I feel violated. She is a low life. You couldn’t get any lower than to steal from a man who was having a seizure. 'She’s picked on me whilst I was unconscious, it was very brazen of her. I could have been dead but even then I don’t think that would have stopped her. I was literally on the floor. 'She is shameless. She carried the theft out under bright lights and under CCTV...'

"By . Leon Watson . Bungling social services allowed a convicted paedophile to subject two young girls to a five-year abuse ordeal, a damning report has revealed. The man carried out a series of sickening attacks on his victims, including rape and sexual assault, some of which he filmed, after Devon County Council failed to intervene. Seven members of the council's social services department have left since the scandal and a serious case review has now found 'severe flaws' in the way the situation was handled. Serious case review: The man assaulted the girls over a five-year period because of failures by social services in Devon (file picture) The man was jailed after pleading guilty to several counts of raping one girl, sexual activity with another and making and taking indecent images of children and was jailed at Exeter Crown Court . He had previously been convicted of an indecent assault on a girl and was sent on a treatment course at a psychiatric hospital as part of a community order. He was also placed on the sex offenders' register. But a report by Devon Safeguarding Children Board has now found he was later allowed to go on abusing children due to a catelogue of errors by social services, who failed to protect the girls. The report, published yesterday, stated: 'The local authority did not effectively fulfill its duty to make inquiries into whether the children were likely to suffer significant harm. 'There appears to have been an insufficient knowledge and understanding of sex offending, offender profiles and the resultant risks to children by the investigating social workers and their front-line managers.' The man admitted at Exeter Crown Court (pictured) several counts of raping one girl and sexual activity with another . The report also said that information . about the man's previous offending - which would have revealed 'both the . level and nature of risk' he posed to children - was not accessed by . social workers. 'Key . linkages, which could have given insight into the abuse being . perpetrated, were not made between the various signs and symptoms being . displayed behaviourally by the children,' the report said. The board found there was 'insufficient knowledge' of the man's history on the part of social workers. Despite his records being available five years before he was finally convicted, the documents were not accessed by the council. Socially workers failed to interview the man when initially called to investigate the case. Links between 'signs and symptoms' of abuse were not made by the authorities. Social workers relied on the testimony of others and failed to speak to the man on three separate occasions. The report added: 'Opportunities were missed at a number of points to take a fresh look at the case and consider the implications of the children's behaviour until the NSPCC became involved in 2012. 'As with many earlier serious case reviews, this case file review points to information being held in disparate places and to no single agency or collaboration of agencies understanding the full picture. 'It seems that the schools and others involved the social work services and the police appropriately, but the investigation/assessment that followed was not broad enough and resulted in inadequate safeguarding. 'The outcomes of some initial assessments were either not shared or, not fully shared with other agencies and this may have impaired multi-agency understanding of risk.' In May 2013, Devon County Council's child protection services were rated inadequate by the regulator Ofsted. In response, the authority set up an independent panel to oversee an improvement in services. A council spokesman said seven members of staff had left the authority but was unable to say whether they had been dismissed or resigned. The social worker involved with the children remains at the county council. Councillor James McInnes, cabinet member for child protection, said: 'We failed these children and I can only apologise for that. 'We take on board all the recommendations that have been made but we have already reviewed and revised all our procedures and practice guidance to try to make sure that nothing like this can happen again. 'There was a serious failure of supervision and management in the system. A social worker made a mistake but the oversight of the case failed. 'No one involved in that oversight is still employed by Devon County Council.'","Man assaulted the girls in Devon over a five-year period .

"By . Leon Watson . A masked Al Qaeda terrorist described as a former Arsenal player in an online video has been identified, it was claimed today. The man, who appeared in the film using a false name, has been identified as a Portuguese citizen, sources have disclosed. It is believed he had been living in Leyton, east London, but it is unclear whether he had trials with Arsenal or any association with the club. Scroll down for video . In a video posted on an extremist website on Saturday a man claimed to be a former Arsenal footballer now fighting in Syria . Sources told The Guardian they do not believe he was a full-time player but he may have attended coaching sessions when potential players are assessed. A spokesman for the club said: 'We do not recognise the individual from the published clips and we don't have any record of this man representing the club at any level.' False rumours had spread that he was former Premiership football star Lassana Diarra, 29, who played for a number of big name English clubs including Arsenal, Chelsea and Portsmouth. As a result, Mr Diarra was forced to deny claims that he had become an Islamic warrior fighting in Syria, saying he had never set foot in the war-torn country. Former Arsenal, Chelsea and Portsmouth player Lassana Diara (right) was forced to deny rumours circulating on Twitter that he is a jihadist fighting in Syria . A lawyer for the French national said he has never even set foot in Syria and currently plays football in Russia . The footage, which appeared two weeks ago and is apparently shot in Syria, shows the man calling on . Muslims in the West to travel to the war-torn region and fight with . radical militants. The man, whose face is hidden by a balaclava and is seen clutching an AK47 rifle, is identified as Abu Isa al-Andalus. According to FiSyria.com, the site . that posted the video, the man moved to London from his native country . to play for Arsenal after growing up alongside a world-famous . footballer. The man's face is covered during the video, in which he clutches an AK47 assault rifle . A spokesman for Arsenal say they have no record of a past player with his name . It claims . the man was radicalised in the capital two years ago before 'leaving . everything' to join the Al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq and . Syria (ISIS). He later adds: 'We have conquered . many cities and we are now implementing the Sharia. We have areas where . the kaffirs (non-Muslims) are paying us the tax. 'If we stay in the kaffir countries we have to pay (taxes) to them. Do you want to be humiliated by this? Think about it. 'If . you have family in these (Western) countries it's a must for you to put . your children in the kaffir schools. ""Who is going to teach your . children?"" It's going to maybe be a gay, maybe a drug dealer, maybe a . paedophile. 'It's very important for you to protect your children. Allah says they are the worst of creatures.' The .

The judge added there were ‘regular contraventions of legislation’, he ‘had failed to respond to advice from the council’, and ‘had exhibited a dismissive attitude towards the local authority’. Councillor Julian Fulbrook, Camden Council’s cabinet member for housing, told the Standard after the case: ‘It should be renamed the Unhappy Vale Hotel - it’s really quite grim.’ He added: ‘It’s a pretty desperate situation.

"By . Rebecca Camber, Crime Reporter . Saved: Lesley Hastings, 53, told yesterday how her dog Maisy nearly died after eating poisoned chicken . A suspected pet poisoner is being hunted by police after three dogs died from eating toxic meat planted in parks. The pets were found to have eaten chunks of chicken and fish smothered in a banned insecticide, while at least three other dogs have been left fighting for their lives after coming into contact with the meat. The poisoner used highly toxic Methomyl. Less than one gram of it is enough to kill a toddler, and just handling it can make an adult seriously ill. Touching the infected meat could have caused nausea, heart irregularities, dizziness, muscle tremors and cramps in adults or death if left untreated. At least six animals have been poisoned in or near Fryent Country Park in Brent, north-west London in the last few months. Detectives are also investigating whether there are any links to suspected poisonings in Hampstead Heath, where another five dogs fell ill last week. A bull lurcher killed in the first attack in January ate what was described as blue tablets inside Fryent Park. Last month another bull lurcher was killed after it ate meat smeared in a blue paste left on a grass verge just outside the southern entrance to the park. Owner Lesley Hastings, 53, told yesterday how she had been left distraught by the loss of pet Toby in the attack, which almost killed another of her dogs, Maisy, a shih tzu-jack russell cross. The casino worker was walking her dogs when she saw Maisy eat a piece of chicken lying under a tree at the side of the road. Tragic: Ms Hastings took an agitated Maisy (left) to the vet after she saw her eat a piece of chicken lying under a tree. She later returned home to find her other dog Toby (right) - who had also eaten some of the meat - dead . Scene: Toby is one of three dogs to have died after eating meat smothered in banned insecticide, Methomyl, at Fryent Country Park (pictured) in Brent, north-west London. Above, a sign warning owners of the poisonings . Unaware of the risk to her own health, she attempted to yank it out of her dog’s mouth – but did not realise Toby had also eaten it. She said: ‘I managed to get the food out Maisy’s mouth. By the time we got back home she was very agitated and shaking. 'Another dog had been poisoned a few months ago so I put her straight in the car and took her to the vet. When I returned home half an hour later Toby was dead. I was heartbroken. I don’t have kids so it’s like losing a family member.’ Rescued: Pauline Morris (left) managed to save her cocker spaniel Bella after rushing her to the vets. Less than one gram of Methomyl (right) is enough to kill a toddler, and just handling it can make an adult seriously ill . Lucky escape: Bella was left fighting for her life after coming into contact with the toxic chunks of chicken . The next day a springer spaniel died and another dog fell ill after ingesting the poison planted in undergrowth on the same road. Pauline Morris managed to save her cocker spaniel Bella after rushing her to the vets. She said: ‘It happened really quickly. Within minutes she was shaking violently. ‘When we took her to the vets we didn’t know if we’d see her again. My three daughters and three grandchildren love her. It’s such an easy thing to do and it is so dangerous. Imagine if a child in the park picked it up?’ Ongoing: At least six animals have been poisoned in or near Fryent Park (pictured) in the last few months . Motive: Police suspect the culprit may have a grudge against owners who leave dog mess lying around or they may have intended to target foxes in the area.

Throttled: Angela Forster's injuries after a neighbour dispute led to her being attacked in her home by neighbour Ian Graham . The families, who used to be friends, fell out in August 2012, after mother-of-two Ms Forster, 46, heightened her back fence, apparently upsetting her neighbours . Sunderland Magistrates' Court heard that trouble between the pair escalated further over arguments about car parking, culminating in the attack in October last year. Prosecuting Keith Laidlaw said: 'It was about 4pm and she was at home in the kitchen, when she heard a few loud bangs at the door. 'She opened the door and saw the defendant standing on the doorstep. Without any warning, he grabbed her by the throat and began to squeeze slightly. 'He began to scream at her, saying ""You have ruined my daughter's life"".' Offence at the fence: The fence in Angela Forster's back garden in Sunderland,  which led to a neighbour dispute and her being attacked in her home . The court heard school cook Angela, who has two children, aged 11 and 17, has been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder since the attack. Speaking outside court, Angela, who has not been back to work since and is on medication, said: 'We used to have a really good relationship, as her son is in the same class as my daughter. 'I didnt even cry at first. I could not believe that someone had come into my home and done something like that. It was horrible.' Defending, Gerry Armstrong, told the court Graham ran his own business and had never been in trouble before. Graham denied assault but was found guilty after trial. He was sentenced to a one-year community order with 160 hours of unpaid work, and told to pay Â£50 in compensation and Â£450 costs.

"By . Chris Brooke . Disgraced former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers launched an attack on the media as he was charged with three drugs offences today. Arriving at a police station to answer bail, he told the assembled reporters and photographers that they were ‘vultures’. However, the man dubbed the ‘Crystal Methodist’ said he would make an exception for the BBC – which had always been ‘really nice’ to him. Scroll down for video . On bail: Reverend Flowers arrives at a Leed police station flanked by minders as he was charged with drugs offences today . Anger: Flowers called waiting journalists 'vultures' but said the BBC had been 'very nice' since the scandal broke last year . Flowers was charged with three counts of possessing illegal drugs and will appear before magistrates next month. He was arrested in November following newspaper allegations that he was involved in a drug deal. But while criticising reporters in a bizarre outburst yesterday, he said: ‘There is a phrase for some people, they call them vultures, and I really do hope that somebody quotes me on that, especially the BBC. Scandal: Flowers appeared angry that the press and said he wanted to quoted on calling them vultures . ‘The BBC have been really nice to me but the rest of you are vultures.’ Flowers, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, has been charged with possession of Class A drugs cocaine and methamphetamine as well as the Class C drug ketamine. He made no comment after leaving the police station at Stainbeck in Leeds. Flowers, who has been attending an addiction treatment programme, turned up accompanied by two minders and carrying the book, Dazzling Darkness –– Gender, Sexuality, Illness and God. Written by Rachel Mann, an Anglican parish priest, it is described as a ‘passionate and nuanced book’ bringing together ‘poetry, feminist theology, and  philosophy and exploring  them through one person’s hunger for wholeness, self-knowledge and God’. Flowers’s solicitor Andrew Hollas said the former bank boss would make a ‘full statement’ following his appearance at Leeds Magistrates Court on May 7. Mr Hollas also took the opportunity to criticise the media. He said his client had been ‘hounded for six months by certain elements of the Press’ and many allegations were ‘completely without foundation’. The Crown Prosecution Service said it had ‘carefully considered’ a file of evidence against Flowers before pressing charges. Flowers was suspended by both the Methodist Church and the Labour Party following allegations that he bought and used illegal drugs. Appointment: The disgraced former Co-op Bank knocks on the door to answer bail at Stainbeck Police Station, where he was charged shortly afterwards . He had stepped down from his position at the Co-op last June, but publicity about his alleged drug habit prompted questions about how he was deemed suitable to run a bank. It also emerged that he quit as a Labour councillor in Bradford after porn was found on his computer, although at the time he claimed he was leaving because of the pressure of work. The Co-operative Bank confirmed last year it was seeking  to recover payments totalling £31,000 made to Flowers amid reports that he was also the subject of an inquiry into ‘lavish’ expenses claims when he resigned. While on bail last month, Flowers gave an interview to the BBC about the furore and admitted he had ‘sinned’. Cosy chat: The Reverend Paul Flowers and Jeremy Paxman during their Newsnight interview last month . He said: ‘I am in company with every other human being for having my frailties and some fragility exposed. Most people get through life without that ever coming into the public domain.’ He described the months since his arrest as ‘hellish’ at times. A second man, Gavin Woroniuk, has been charged with four offences of offering to supply a controlled drug and possession of criminal property.

"By . Katy Winter . Anyone entering a new tearoom in Weston-super-Mare might be forgiven for wondering if they've just exited a time machine and landed with a bump in war time Britain. Well not quite but the quirky cafe, The Blitz Tearoom, does aim to take customers back 70 years to World War II. From the music of Glen Miller and Vera Lynn to the decor and menu and even staff uniform - everything harks back to the Second World War. Ex army corporal, Michelle Austin, here posing with two manikins in traditional 1940s clothes, started the cafe to celebrate the spirit of the Blitz . Shelves are adorned with 1940's relics,  including antique tins originally containing dried milk, camp coffee and anti-gas ointment, along with Blitz-time radiograms and Bakelite phones . The walls are painted a mint green - a typical 1940's shade, while wartime relics include gas masks, home guard training manuals, along with ration book covered menus . Michelle stands in the corridor which has been turned into Bethnal Green underground station - itself used as an air raid shelter during the war . The Blitz tearoom in Weston-super-Mare has been set up ex army corporal, Michelle Austin, 37, as a celebration of the era. The single mother-of-three served in Germany before she left the army after nine years, in 2004, and started looking around for a fresh challenge. She says: ‘I took a series of kitchen assistant jobs but grew bored so I went to college to train as a chef.  After that I worked in a tearoom but I decided I want to do something for myself and found a premises in the town.’ The former clothes shop was stripped back and took a year for the transformation to be complete. ‘It looked like a building site, and took a lot of hard work, but finally when I saw the results I was thrilled,’ says Michelle. Shelves are adorned with 1940‘s relics, including antique tins originally containing dried milk, camp coffee and anti-gas ointment, along with Blitz-time radiograms and Bakelite phones. Meanwhile Union Jack bunting, flags, and images of Lancaster Bombers and Spitfires are strewn across the walls. The walls are lined with posters and messages reminiscent of the times including: 'Dig for Victory' and 'Make do and Mend' A British flag hangs on the cafe wall, with a painting of German planes bombing London during the Blitz at its centre . The menu is a 1940's gastronomical experience which among other things include retro finger sandwiches of spam, egg and cress corned beef . Michelle (second right) and the staff dress in authentic polka dot dresses, headscarves and floral aprons . The counter has a: ‘When in doubt, brew . up’ War Department sign, and there are other  messages reminiscent of . the times including: ‘Dig for Victory’ and ‘Make do and Mend.’ Mother-of-three Michelle says she is thrilled with the results of the makeover . A Welsh dresser is stacked with pretty vintage crockery while staff dress in authentic polka dot dresses, headscarves and floral aprons - typical of the fashion at that time. The walls are painted a mint green - a fashionable 1940‘s shade, while wartime relics include gas masks, home guard training manuals, along with ration book covered menus. The corridor leading out to the courtyard has been turned into Bethnal Green underground station -itself used as an air raid shelter during the war.  And in the tunnel the walls are covered with posters of the day. The look is completed by two mannequins - of a woman and a child evacuee. The menu is a 1940’s gastronomical experience too which among other things includes retro finger sandwiches of spam, egg and cress and corned beef. Drinks range from milk served in old fashioned small glass bottles, to ginger beer and Camp coffee. Michelle says: ‘I’ve always been into retro stuff and the idea of the 1940‘s just came to me. ‘People like a bit of nostalgia, we can enjoy the glamour without the danger and I’m looking to set up World War two themed nights soon.’","Former corporal Michelle started cafe after leaving army in 2004 .

"By . Simon Cable Showbusiness Correspondent . He was one of Britain’s best-loved comedians, not to mention a favourite of the Queen. But Tommy Cooper’s legion of fans may struggle to see the funny side of a new drama film – which depicts the legendary fez-wearing entertainer as a violent alcoholic. Tommy Cooper: Not Like That, Like This will be broadcast on ITV on Monday evening to mark the 30th anniversary of the star’s death. David Threlfall, as Tommy Cooper and Amanda Redman, who plays his wife Gwen, feature in a new film about the comic's private life . But rather than focus on his career, the two-hour biopic concentrates on his 17-year affair with his assistant Mary Fieldhouse, his battle with alcoholism and episodes of domestic violence. The drama, written by Simon Nye who penned 1990s sitcom Men Behaving Badly, stars Shameless actor David Threlfall as Cooper, and is the most high-profile film to focus on the comedian’s private life. In one scene, Cooper and his wife Gwen, who is played by actress Amanda Redman, are shown having a drunken brawl in the street after she suspects he is having an affair – during which he is shown punching her in the face. Later in the programme his mistress is shown with a bruise on her cheek after refusing to give him more alcohol after a night of heavy drinking. However, both Nye and Miss Redman have defended the film, saying it is ‘respectful’ to Cooper. Comedian and magician Tommy Cooper, pictured with his wife Gwen . It is also understood that the comedian’s daughter Vicky helped with the research for the drama, and gave it her blessing. Nye said Cooper’s violence towards his wife and mistress, along with his reputation as a big drinker, are all well-known. Asked if he felt any reservations about including the scenes of domestic violence because of the comic’s status as a national treasure, the writer said: ‘It’s on record, it is not something that we invented. So I hope that we did it in a delicate way and didn’t make it unnecessary. ‘You don’t want people who don’t know Tommy’s comedy to go away thinking he was a wife-beater. But he was physical, and he was physical with his wife, who gave as good as she got. The ITV film marks the 30th anniversary of Tommy Cooper's death . ‘So that relationship worked and he did try to replicate that in a way with Mary, and she wasn’t the same person, so it looked actually worse than it was. ‘Drink was obviously a huge influence, and although he got very good at handling his drink, the quantities were enormous.’ Cooper died of a heart attack live on stage in front of millions of viewers, during a performance on the London Weekend Television variety show at Her Majesty’s Theatre in 1984, when he was aged just 63. During his career he developed an alcohol problem while struggling to deal with stage fright. Miss Redman, 56, said she hoped the drama will not upset the comedian’s fans, adding: ‘We’ve tried to be respectful and not dishonour Tommy. We see the stress the man was under and the fact that he did indeed love two people at the same time. It might be hard to grasp, but he did. ‘Some viewers may be quite shocked by this and think, “I’m seeing him in a new light”, but that would be a shame. ‘It doesn’t detract from what he was to the public – one of our greatest comedians.’ Clive Greenaway, who runs the Tommy Cooper Fan Club, said yesterday: ‘The film will obviously be dramatised. I haven’t seen it, but I don’t think they needed to go down that road. ‘They could have celebrated his life and career, which saw him become one of Britain’s highest-paid entertainers. He was a favourite of the Queen.’","New drama shows the comedian entertainer as a violent alcoholic .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A restaurant which launched an online wedding competition has been forced to scrap the contest after cyber bullies trolled the entrants. The Tavistock Retro in South Shields, South Tyneside, launched the Â£7,000 giveaway to coincide with its third anniversary, offering four couples the chance to battle it out for the dream wedding. To win the prize the couples had to compete by saying why they deserved the prize and try to gain the restaurant more likes on its Facebook page. Several of the likers of the Facebook page vent their disgust at some of the comments made towards the contestants . But the competition was axed by the . Italian eatery after some of the brides-to-be and their families, some . of which had terminally ill relatives, received abusive messages on the . social network. It is unclear what the abusive messages said as they have now been removed from Facebook. One of the contestants of the competition, who did not want to be named, told Mailonline: 'The comments weren't on and I'm glad they were removed. 'I don't blame the Tavistock for pulling the competition, there was no need for some of the comments. 'These stupid people have ruined it for everybody else.' A . spokesman for the Tavistock Retro said: 'It was with great regret that . we had to cancel the competition as things quite simply got out of hand. We do not condone bullying, and nor can we be seen to promote it. 'It's a great shame that a few individuals spoilt a lovely thing for four couples. But we could not endorse this.' Up for grabs in the contest was a November wedding package, which included transport, venue hire, a cake, reception and entertainment. The four short-listed couples had to compete for the prize by posting pictures of themselves on the Facebook page. Within days of the competition's launch at the start of this month, all couples competing had amassed thousands of likes each. Several posters, including this one urged the restaurant to reverse their decision to pull the competition . After being pulled, several posters urged the restaurant to reverse their decision. One post said: 'Can't believe yous cancelled the wedding competition. 'Shame allot of people made a good effort I know you would agree as well.' But a statement posted on the restaurant's Facebook page, which has also since been removed, read: 'After a lot of deliberation between the management team we regret to inform you all that the wedding competition is going to have to be cancelled. 'This was always the last resort and we honestly are shocked by some of the negative comments and verbal abuse which has been evident.

'We have received many personal . messages from people accusing us of condoning internet bullying and even . threatening us with police action. 'As a result, we feel the only option is to cancel the competition. 'This . competition was intended to be a celebration of our third anniversary. It was a gift to the community, for all the amazing support we have had . over the past three years. 'Unfortunately, we have been shocked that this gift has had to end in this way. 'We are not giving in to 'bullying' by this, we are merely putting an end to it by closing the competition .

"By . Tim Shipman . Claims that almost one  million people have had to resort to emergency supplies from food banks in the past year were dismissed as ‘misleading and emotionally manipulative’ yesterday. The row came after the Trussell Trust, a charity that runs more than 400 of Britain’s food banks, said rising numbers were turning to the charity because their incomes have been ‘squeezed’. It claimed more than 913,000 people received three days’ emergency food in the past year – almost a threefold rise on the previous 12 months – with over half blaming changes or delays to their benefit payments. The Trussell Trust who runs more than 400 food banks was accused  of 'misleading the public' on the issue of food poverty . A letter signed by 36 Anglican bishops and more than 600 church leaders from all major dominations also called for urgent action from ministers to tackle food poverty. But senior figures in the Government yesterday accused the Trust of ‘publicity seeking’ to benefit its own ‘business’, pointing out that the growing number of food banks inevitably leads to people seeking out free food if it is available. The Department for Work and Pensions added that a recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development actually found that food poverty has gone down under this government. The proportion of those in the UK who said they are finding it difficult to afford food dropped from 9.8 per cent in 2007 to 8.1 per cent in 2012. One senior Whitehall source described the food bank issue as 'fairly misleading and emotionally manipulative publicity seeking' But the Trussell Trust’s chairman, Chris Mould, said: ‘In the last year we’ve seen things get worse, rather than better, for many people on low incomes.  It’s been extremely tough for a lot of people, with parents not eating properly in order to feed their children and more people than ever experiencing seemingly unfair and harsh benefits sanctions.’ In a highly political intervention, he also called for the Government to drop sanctions against benefit claimants and increase the minimum wage. But a senior Whitehall source accused Mr Mould of ‘fairly misleading and emotionally manipulative publicity seeking’. The source added: ‘It’s not entirely surprising given Chris Mould is effectively running a business.’ Another official said: ‘The Trussell Trust have a stated aim to have a food bank in every town in the country, suggesting that they view food banks as a positive feature of a “big society”. ‘It’s slightly confusing to hear them condemning increased use at the same time as aggressively marketing their services.’ The Department of Work and Pensions said fewer people were struggling with their food bills according to a recent OECD report . Tory MP Nigel Mills, a member of the work and pensions select committee, criticised the Trust’s views on benefits. ‘For those in genuine need, the benefits system gives people a decent level of help,’ he said. ‘I don’t think any of my constituents are clamouring for us to increase benefits. ‘There are nothing like a million people in this country who can’t afford to put a meal on the table.’ A DWP spokesman said: ‘Even the OECD says there are fewer people struggling with their food bills compared with a few years ago, benefit processing times are improving and the Trussell Trust’s own research recognises the effect their marketing activity has on the growth of their business.’","Food bank charity accused of 'emotionally manipulative publicity seeking'

"By . Andrew Levy . Money may not grow on trees… but for the residents of one lucky town, it has started popping through the letterbox. Bewildered householders in Colchester have had hundreds of pounds in cash posted anonymously through their doors. The recipients all live on the same road in the Essex town – and were stunned when the mystery money dropped on to their doormats among  the usual daily post. Shock: Lesley Quilter, 58, said she has been ¿going crazy¿ trying to work out who would want to send her £200 . Lesley Quilter, 58, said she has been ‘going crazy’ trying to work out who would want to send her £200. Her neighbour has also received an envelope containing £100, again with no note or name on it. Mrs Quilter said: ‘I was shocked when I opened the envelope. I just thought it would be an invitation or something like that – it really is driving us nuts because we have no idea who is sending it. ‘It is lovely but I would like to thank them for it.’ Mrs Quilter’s cash arrived in an envelope measuring 6in by 6in and was folded inside a sheet of lined writing paper. The postmark was smudged – but her neighbour’s cash came in an envelope posted within the region. The mystery deepened when Mrs Quilter’s brother-in-law, who also used to live in Wickham Road, was gifted £200 which was sent to his address in the nearby village of Fingringhoe. He moved in 1979 – so the mystery mailer appears to know the people he or she is sending the bank notes to. Doreen Neal, 86, who received the cash in £20 notes, said the only link between the three recipients was that they had all lived in the road . Mrs Quilter added: ‘From the writing on the envelope it looks like an elderly person, possibly female, but we have no idea  who it is. ‘Whoever sent it knew my brother-in-law had moved and knew his new address.’ Mrs Quilter has even contacted friends and former neighbours in a bid to solve the riddle but so far no-one has confessed to being the generous donor. Doreen Neal, 86, who received the cash in £20 notes, said the only link between the three recipients was that they had all lived in the road. The mystery deepened when Mrs Quilter¿s brother-in-law, who used to live in Wickham Road, was sent £200 . She wouldn’t even have known there were other people who had been sent the cash by the mystery benefactor if a friend of hers hadn’t mentioned what had happened to an acquaintance of Mrs Quilter. She added: ‘I know Lesley but we’re not really friends and we don’t go out together. And I don’t know her brother-in-law at all.’ The retired office worker receives a state pension and modest private pension and said she hadn’t mentioned needing money to anyone as she was fairly ‘comfortable’. Royal Mail last night confirmed a code on the postmark from Mrs Neal’s letter showed it had been collected from a post box somewhere in the Chelmsford area. The details were indecipherable on Mrs Quilter’s letter, although the handwriting suggests they were sent by the same person. No other residents in the street appear to have received any cash in the post. But one said: ‘I wouldn’t say no.’","The recipients all live on the same road in the Essex town .

"By . Darren Boyle . The former boss of a mental health charity and his wife who stole over £200,000 from vulnerable disabled clients have been jailed for a total of six years. Peter Childs, 61, and his wife Alison, 48, worked for Lincoln and District Mencap but took disability living allowance benefits being paid to people who they were being paid to protect. A court heard Mr Childs even set up a £1,000-a-month ‘ghost’ contract for his 27-year-old Lithuanian mistress and showered her with expensive gifts. Peter Childs (left) and his wife Alison (right) swindled disabled people out of more than £200,000 . He financed the extravagant lifestyle by plundering the bank accounts of Lincoln and District Mencap and the clients he was supposed to care for. The charity is operated independently of the national Royal Mencap organisation. Mr Childs, who was the chairman, and Alison, who worked as accommodation manager, swindled more than £200,000 during their cruel six year scam. They also pocketed cold weather payments and overcharged disabled clients for overcharged for utility bills by exploiting their victims’ vulnerabilities. Last month the couple were convicted by a jury of 12 charges of theft and 14 charges of fraud by abuse of position between December 2005 and December 2011. On Tuesday at Lincoln Crown Court they were both jailed for three years. Peter Childs (seated) and his wife Alison (standing) were convicted of 12 charges of theft and 14 charges of fraud between December 2005 and December 2011 by a jury at Lincoln Crown Court . Sentencing Judge Sean Morris said the pair had taken advantage of some of society’s most vulnerable people. He said: 'You were entrusted to look after the interests of some of Lincoln’s most vulnerable and trusting adults. 'Neither of you had the guts or plain decency to admit from the outset everything you had done. 'You set about, over a long period, concocting a defence that culminated in a trial lasting weeks, costing the state a fortune and the calling of vulnerable people to give evidence. 'It culminated in both of you going into the witness box and telling lie after lie after lie.' Lincoln Crown Court heard that Childs bought his mistress Inga Stasytyte (pictured) a range of expensive gifts including a £5,000 Land Rover . During their five-week trial a jury was told Mr Childs - who arrived at court in a wheelchair - also put his Lithuanian mistress Inga Stasytyte on the payroll even though she never worked for the charity. The court heard he bought her a £5,000 Land Rover and other romantic gifts and flowers. Ms Stasytyte came to Britain in 2006 and met the Childs while working at a holiday park in Norfolk. She moved into their luxurious farmhouse, initially as a housekeeper. He went on to father a boy with her but the relationship ended after Miss Stasytyte returned from a visit to Lithuania to find that Alison Childs had moved back in. Giving evidence she said: 'He bought me a car, a Land Rover. It cost about £5,000. He bought me flowers and stuff. I was paid monthly.' Ms Stasytyte returned to Lithuania as Childs prepared to divorce his wife but when she returned he suffered a stroke and was living with his wife again. Ms Stasytyte added: 'I realised then all our relationship was based on lies.' The trial also heard the couple, from Nettleham, Lincs., defrauded Lincolnshire County Council by inflating employee numbers and staff working hours in order to obtain extra grant funding. Two Lincoln and District Mencap clients Roger and Richard Fogg, 57, were said to have paid a total of £28,000 for gas, electricity and water bills over the course of six years when their actual bills were only £7,400. Prosecutor Stephen Lowne said the crimes came to light after Peter Childs suffered a stroke and his wife took time off work to look after him. He said: 'These two defendants held a considerable position of trust. 'They had the responsibility of looking after people with varying degrees of mental difficulties. 'These are people who did not have the ability to understand what was happening.' Mr Childs, who also ran a private security firm, claimed he was legally entitled to the money as he was paid an honorarium by the charity. Mrs Childs claimed she left financial matters to her husband and was not involved in either fraud or theft. The charity operated independently of the national Royal Mencap organisation to which it was affiliated. Judge Sean Morris told Lincoln Crown Court (pictured) that the pair were 'entrusted to look after the interests of some of Lincoln's most vulnerable and trusting adults' before jailing them each for three years .","Peter Childs used cash stolen from disabled clients to buy gifts for lover .

"By . David Kent . After watching the winger seal Real Madrid's first trophy since 2012, Carlo Ancelotti said the club are lucky to have Gareth Bale.

After struggling with fitness and form early on in his career at the Bernabeu, some doubted Bale's £86million price tag, but with 20 goals now this season he is making up for it. Ancelotti called the goal 'surely the most important' of Bale's career, adding: 'It was a decisive moment. When (Marc) Bartra scored anything could have happened. 'He played well, the entire team played well. You have to play as a compact unit to beat Barcelona.'

"By . Sam Webb . A mugger was thwarted and jailed thanks to two postal workers who chased him through the streets after hearing his victim's cries for help. Drug addict Daniel Hall, 33, snatched a woman's bag after she got off a bus in Plymouth, Devon. But the 42-year-old victim's cries were heard by Royal Mail workers Martin Harris, 49, and Sharon O'Connor, 38, who were driving past in their mail van. The heroes that deliver: Sharon O'Connor and Martin Harris, who chased down mugger Daniel Hall, after he snatched a woman's bag . They chased up with the thief, who flung down the bag before making his escape. He was arrested just a few hours later because of the detailed   description the two postal workers gave police. The father-of-one, who has more than 29 previous convictions, began an eight month jail sentence this week after admitting robbery at Plymouth Crown   Court. Mr Harris and Ms O'Connor described how they were doing their morning round on January 30 when they heard the victim shouting for help. Addict: Daniel Miller, who has more than 29 previous convictions, began an eight month jail sentence this week after admitting robbery at Plymouth Crown Court . Mother-of-three Sharon said: 'The man was running towards us and we could see he had something. As we were watching we could hear the woman shouting ""he   took my bag"".  'We looked at each other and I just put my foot down and went after him. 'I knew we could cut him off at the top of the lane if we were quick enough. We did not have time to think, the adrenaline took over.' Once Hall was cornered, Mr Harris leapt out and demanded he hand over the bag. He said: 'I jumped out of the van and asked him to give the bag back as politely as I could. He hesitated so then I asked him again more forcibly and he   threw it at me before he ran off. 'I took the bag down to the lady and she saw that no money had been taken and she was saying, ""thank you so much"". 'She was shaken up but she gave me a hug and was very happy.' The court heard Hall of Devonport, Plymouth, had 29 previous convictions and had been on drugs since he was a teenager. His lawyer said he was expecting his second child but Recorder Simon Foster said he had choice but to send him to jail. Mr Harris, who has been a postman for 12 years, said he would do the same again if he saw a defenceless woman being targeted. He said: 'They have started calling us Batman and Robin at work and saying the crime rate is going to go down on our patch. 'I just did not want this kind of person to get away with it. He has mugged some defenceless woman which is not the toughest thing to do. 'It is only afterwards that you think, well anything could have happened.' Co-workers have started calling the fearless duo 'Batman and Robin' after their brave intervention .","Martin Harris and Sharon O'Connor heard victim's cries as they did round .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Manuel Pellegrini admitted that his Manchester City players were mentally shattered by Sunday’s defeat at Liverpool after their title hopes were dealt another devastating blow by bottom-of the-table Sunderland on Wednesday night. The City boss refused to give up the chase as his team slipped to third favourites behind Liverpool and Chelsea following the shock 2-2 home draw - three days after losing at Anfield. Only a late slip by Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone, letting in Samir Nasri’s 88th-minute equaliser, spared them another defeat. Pellegrini admitted: ‘We couldn’t take the Liverpool game out of our minds. It was very difficult for the players to do that after three days. At this moment it is more mental than physical. Mentally it was very difficult to play this game after Liverpool. We needed more intensity but our minds maybe were not right to do it.

Quick draw: It had started so well for the home side when Fernandinho fired them ahead inside two minutes . ‘We had a low performance at the beginning of February but after that we recovered and have had very good results until we lost against Liverpool.’ Pellegrini will try to summon the spirit of 2012, when City came from behind to beat Manchester United to the title on goal difference on the final day of the season, adding: ‘This team two years ago were six points behind the leaders and won the title at the end. We have five games more to play, we must try to win the games and we’ll see at the end of the season which team has more points. ‘Maybe at this moment Liverpool and Chelsea have the better chance because of our position but we will keep fighting until the last day of the season. ‘My duty is to talk with the players and try to win the last five games. Before this match I was very worried. To play against a relegated team at the end of the season is always very difficult because they fight for every ball.’ The result left City six points behind Liverpool with a game in hand, the same gap that separates Sunderland from safety at the foot of the table as they prepare to visit Chelsea. ‘It’s one more blow,’ said manager Gus Poyet. ‘I tell you what, I’m testing my heart this year. Every week. I’m realistic and I’m not going to change now. We played a great game. ‘I thought for a few minutes we were going to get all three points, but we didn’t because of an incredible moment again.

'It is time this case was closed, 30 years of being in the news and dealing with the pressure of media attention takes its toll on all the family, more than you will ever know.' Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told the memorial service: 'At the end of the day, Yvonne Fletcher's parents lost their daughter. 'Her sister lost a sister. We lost a colleague, and we're determined to make sure we catch the person responsible,' he said.

MI6 officers have reportedly been talking to officials in Tripoli about the suspect, a former Libyan official, believed to be in his late 50s, following the downfall of Colonel Gaddafi. It is thought he may be hiding in Egypt under the protection of the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood movement. A source close to the investigation told the Daily Mirror: 'This is a very significant development in the inquiry. 'The MI6 officers’ task is to liaise with local people to find the killers of Yvonne Fletcher. The Yard wants it settled and to announce the coup by the end of the year since it has gone on for so long.' The Foreign Office confirmed that British police had also been to Libya to talk about the case and said developments were expected. 'Helping the Metropolitan Police Service take forward their investigation into the murder of PC Fletcher is a priority. We continue to provide the police whatever support we can,' a spokesman said. 'We are pleased the Metropolitan Police Service were able to return to Tripoli earlier this year to continue building cooperation on this case with the new Libyan authorities.

No one has ever been brought to justice for the murder of policewoman Yvonne Fletcher, who was shot dead outside Libya's London embassy on April 17, 1984. Here is a timeline of events following her death: . April 17, 1984 . Wpc Yvonne Fletcher, 25, is shot by a sniper while policing a protest outside the Libyan embassy in St James's Square, London, and 11 students are wounded. She is pronounced dead shortly afterwards at Westminster Hospital. Her killer is thought to have been smuggled out of the country and back to Libya after the shooting. Her death leads to an 11-day siege of the building and the severing of diplomatic links between the UK and Libya. 1999 .

Detectives spend seven weeks in Libya interviewing witnesses and suspects. September 2009 . It emerges that the Foreign Office has conceded that any trial for the shooting will take place in Tripoli. It is reported that the agreement was struck three years previously, when trade deals worth hundreds of millions of pounds were being negotiated. Campaigners for Wpc Fletcher's family brand the matter 'an absolute disgrace'. February 2011 . Major political protests begin in Libya against Gaddafi's government and civil war breaks out. August 2011 . The Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) says that Abdulqadir alBaghdadi, one of the suspects for Wpc Fletcher's murder, has been shot in the head.

"By . Jeff Powell . Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail . The fighter for whom Amir Khan was so unceremoniously dumped by Floyd Mayweather believes his elevation to next month’s Money fight has spared the boxing public a night of expensive tedium. Marcos Maidana, not content with having gate-crashed Khan’s party, has added insult to the Englishman’s wounded pride by saying: ‘If Amir had got this fight it would have been very boring.’ Since the one thing Khan has never been accused of is being unexciting, that requires explanation. When pressed Maidana adds: ‘Both he and Mayweather are pure boxers. So, unlike me, neither of them would go on the attack.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Floyd Mayweather offering tickets in true Pretty Boy style . Attack: Marcos Maidana will fight Floyd Mayweather and will have a go at the American . Pure boxer: Amir Khan's style would be cancelled out by Mayweather which could lead to a boring bout . Outfought: Khan beat Maidana four years ago when the pair met in Las Vegas . Down but not out: Khan put Maidana on the canvas with a lethal body shot but the Argentinian got up and fought on . He does not mean to be disrespectful to the young man from Bolton, who inflicted one of just three defeats on his 37-fight record. He is talking styles and says: ‘Khan was one of the biggest fights of my career and also one of the toughest in my life. He’s a very good boxer.’ So good that four years ago in Las Vegas he staved off Maidana’s challenge for the world light welterweight title he held at the time despite being caught by one of the massive punches which have given the Argentine 31 knockouts in his 35 wins. Despite his reputation for having a suspect chin, Khan survived that blow and several more big shots in that late round to take a unanimous decision. Now he has lost to Maidana his May 3 date in Vegas with Mayweather. Not only that, he has to accept appearing on the undercard at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in a non-title fight against the awkward former champion Luis Collazo. Not that Maidana is bothered about that, even though he admitted he was surprised to be a late choice for Mayweather, saying: ‘Like everyone else I thought Khan had it.’ As we talked, hours before Manny Pacquiao’s brilliant righting of that wrong decision against Tim Bradley, his concern  was with how to deal with the No 1 pound-for-pound boxer in the world. Where Khan is lightning fast, the perceived wisdom is that Maidana is not quick enough to seriously trouble Mayweather. To which he says: ‘We’re working on speed every day and I’m getting quicker. But it’s not all about that. I’m also training harder than ever before so I can keep the pressure on Mayweather.  I have that one-punch KO power in both hands but I won’t only be going for the head. ‘Most of Floyd’s opponents have done that but his defence is so good. I will be putting some of my power into a lot more body shots than he usually gets.’ Putting his Money where his mouth is: Mayweather chose to face Maidana rather than Khan on May 3 . Also, as the underdog, he will ignore the ridicule he expects to come his  way from the Mayweather camp, saying: ‘I’m prepared to put up with them laughing at us. As we did before beating Adrien Broner.’ It was that upset victory over Broner which enabled Mayweather to deny Khan his promised opportunity and bring in the more orthodox Maidana. But the man called El Chino recalls how Mayweather took more punches from Miguel Cotto in their recent fight and says: ‘It looked as if at his age (37) Floyd might be slowing just a little. Cotto caught him a lot and I have more power than him. I’ll be throwing a lot of punches, like against Broner. I will catch Floyd at some point and when I do I will finish him.’ Is he oblivious to the 10-1 odds currently against him the casinos on the Strip? ‘I like being the underdog,’ he says. ‘I know it will be a very difficult fight but I enjoy to give surprises.’ He is also fighting for his nation. Much of the conversation revolved around Carlos Monzon, the greatest of all Argentinian fighters, Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona. National heroes: Boxer Carlos Monzon and footballers Diego Maradona (below left) and Lionel Messi (below right) are revered in Argentina . Maidana says: ‘They are all great heroes in my country. People talk about them all the time, me included. ‘But now I’m fighting for the pride of Argentina and when I beat Mayweather it will be an historic victory for my country.’ For the moment, at least, that is an opportunity being denied Amir Khan. Even in the hardest game there is room for humour. Tim Bradley, shortly before Saturday’s thrilling re-match with Manny Pacquiao, declared that his mobility had been restricted by foot injuries in their first fight in which he was given that controversial decision. And he blamed it on not wearing socks. Socks symbol: Tim Bradley in training before his defeat by Manny Pacquiao at the weekend . Freddie Roach, the PacMan’s fabled trainer, could not resist.He sent Bradley a box of socks and a letter which, including the deliberate misspellings, read: ‘Is it really your feetal position that these injuries occurred because you did not wear socks? ‘Though many members of the media think this excuse sounds like a hose job, I for one do believe you. To me you are boxing’s No 1 sox symbol. ‘Think of me as your sole supporter. I hope the enclosed gift helps with the heeling process.’ Bradley, gentleman that he is, took in good part. Heeling process: Freddie Roach sent this light-hearted letter to Tim Bradley after the American's complaints . Saturday brings Scott Quigg’s chance to reclaim some of the super-bantamweight limelight, following Carl Frampton’s KO victory in a world title eliminator. Quigg, already the WBA ‘regular’ world champion, defends that title against Pan African title holder Tshifhiwa Munyai. Once both he and Frampton have alpha-belts around their waists, the stage will surely be set for another Battle of Britain. Quigg v Munyai will be live on Sky Sports on Saturday night. Bernard Hopkins continues to defy the laws of nature. On Saturday night, at the age of 49 and already the oldest world champion, he hopes to break the age record for unifying titles. Hopkins, the IBF light-heayweight champion, takes on Kazakhstan’s Beibut Shumenov, the WBA belt holder in Washington. Rolling back the years: Bernard Hopkins in training as he tries to become the oldest fighter to unify titles . A 55th victory in 62 fights will propel him on beyond 50 to even bigger fights. As he says: ‘I’m always making history now.’ In truth he has never been the most exciting fighter to watch – but catch him while you can. Hopkins v Shumenov will be live on BoxNation on Saturday night.","Marcos Maidana says Amir Khan and Floyd Mayweather are 'pure boxers'

"By . Elsa Mcalonan . There have been so many questions from readers about how to disguise pigmentation, redness and fine lines, that this week I’m looking at make-up that hides those annoying signs of ageing. This month brings new savvy products, including complexion-perfecting creams, to tackle these issues. Becca’s Ultimate Coverage Complexion Creme (£34, Space NK), gives great coverage to fine lines, redness, pigmentation and other imperfections, and is available in 20 shades. New look: Reader Helen, 59, loved how young her makeover made her looks . L’Oreal Paris Nude Magique Blur Cream (£9.99, Boots) is non-greasy and comes in green to counteract redness, violet to brighten dull skin and peach to wake up tired skin. And Avon’s Anew Reversalist Complete Express Wrinkle Smoother (out February 13, £18, avonshop.co.uk) can be used before or after foundation and patted over make-up during the day when you need a retouch. It feels like a balm, but turns to powder on your skin. I can also tell you about Studio 10, which launches today. Its smart, slim palettes and pencils deal with age-related issues. It offers workshops with make-up artists so you can learn how to use colour correctors, highlight like a professional and so on. Make-up artists will also come to your home so you and a group of friends can learn together. Reader Helen, 59, from Guildford, Surrey, tried one of these sessions for me. International make-up artist Mark Cook showed her how to disguise enlarged pores and fine lines, cover age spots and lessen redness, and the tricks of clever contouring and highlighting. He used the Age Defy Skin Perfector Kit (£32), which includes a primer, colour correctors and two concealers. After applying primer to smooth fine lines, Mark used green colour corrector to tone down redness and creamy concealer to hide pigmentation. ‘Use a dark, matte shade on areas you want to recede and absorb light, and a highlighter to lift and bring features forward,’ he says. ‘When contouring, use a completely matte product, otherwise it won’t look natural. ‘Start to contour with the darker shade in the hollow of the cheek, below the apple, and blend towards the hairline. Next, create balance by applying the product to the hollows of the temples and forehead. ‘Then, apply highlighter on top of the cheekbones, following the natural contour, and down to the lower cheek. ‘Finish off with the other areas that naturally catch light — the forehead, bridge of the nose, chin and upper lip. ‘Finally, use blusher to add youthful flush. ’ So what did Helen think? ‘It makes me feel the way I used to when I felt good about myself,’ she says. Exfoliate: Ragdale Hall Luxurious Spa Body Butter . SCRUB IT BETTER . Ragdale Hall’s Invigorating Spa Shower Scrub is formulated with bamboo and pumice extracts for a gentle exfoliation.

Therapists at the Leicestershire-based spa advise applying the scrub  to damp skin  in circular movements, paying particular attention to dry areas such as the knees and elbows, before  rinsing off. This should be done once or twice a week. For best results, follow with a generous application of the brand’s Luxurious Spa  Body Butter.

"By . Mark Duell . She lived through the Russian Revolution and well over a century of history, but a Georgian woman who claimed to be the world’s oldest living person has died at the age of 132. Antisa Khvichava, who lived in the remote mountain village of Sachino in Georgia, held Soviet-era documents which said she was born on 8 July 1880, but her age was contested and never proven. The woman, who lived with her 42-year-old grandson in an idyllic vine-covered country house in the mountains, retired from her job as a tea and corn picker in 1965, when she was aged 85. Scroll down for video . Oldest claim: Antisa Khvichava (pictured in 2010), who lived in the remote mountain village of Sachino in Georgia, held Soviet-era documents which said she was born in 8 July 1880 . Soviet-era: A Georgian local official shows a document with the birth date of Mrs Khvichava in Sachino . She was said to have had 12 grandchildren, 18 great-grandchildren, and four great-great grandchildren – and attributed her good health to drinking a small amount of local brandy every day. Her 72-year-old son Mikhail was apparently born when his mother was 60. Mrs Khvichava said she also had two children from a previous marriage - but they died of hunger during World War Two. Mrs Khvichava lived through two world wars along with the rise and fall of the Soviet Union. Officials, neighbours, friends, and descendants have backed up her claim as the world's oldest living person. Her birth certificate was lost - one of many in the past century amid revolutions and a civil war which followed the end of the USSR - but she had two Soviet-era documents which attested to her age. Documentation: Mrs Khvichava (pictured in 2010) holds her passport in her home in the village of Sachino . Claims never proven: Georgian media reported that she was the oldest living person on the planet . Experts doubted her claim, substantiated on birth documents much younger than her. Georgia became part of the Soviet Union in 1921 - and was part of the Russian empire when she was ‘born’. Without 130-year-old documents, University of California lecturer and Gerontology Research Group member Stephen Coles said the claim will ‘remain a curiosity in a newspaper or floating on the internet’. She only spoke in her local language of Mingrelian, and said in 2010 through a translator at her 130th birthday party: 'I've always been healthy, and I've worked all my life - at home and at the farm.’ She had trouble walking, stayed largely in bed over the past decade and her cramped fingers meant she could not maintain her love of knitting - but relatives said her mind stayed sharp. To mark her 130th birthday, a string group played folk music out on the lawn, while grandchildren offered traditional Mingrelian dishes such as corn porridge and spiced chicken with herbs.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Tragic: Trudy Glenister lost four litres of blood on her way to Southend Hospital and died shortly after arriving . A pregnant woman bled to death after junior paramedics waited 40 minutes to take her to hospital, it has emerged. Trudy Glenister, 38, warned family she thought she was 'losing the baby' after she started vomiting and suffering from severe abdominal pains in April 2011. But trainee ambulance staff refused to leave for Southend Hospital for almost an hour - and would not use the emergency sirens, an inquest has heard. Instead they opted to 'observe' Mrs Glenister for 40 minutes before deciding to take her to hospital. Paramedics also initially dismissed the possibility of her suffering an ectopic pregnancy - where the foetus grows in the fallopian tube rather than the womb - and failed to realise there was an internal bleed. Mrs Glenister, who was five weeks pregnant with her second child, went into cardiac arrest after suffering internal bleeding caused by the ectopic pregnancy. She died moments after arriving at hospital. In a damning narrative verdict, Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray slammed the East of England Ambulance Service for the 'disturbing' failings. Failings listed included student paramedics failed to fully to appreciate an acute emergency and did not alert the hospital. She . blasted the 'unacceptable delay' transferring Mrs Glenister, who lost four litres of blood in the time it took to reach the hospital. She added that the blue lights and sirens should have been used on the way. Mrs Beasley-Murray told Chelmsford Coroner's Court: 'There were serious failings in the care provided to Mrs Glenister by the the East of England Ambulance Service. 'Much in this case has been troubling. 'Firstly, the apparent lack of training on the subject of ectopic pregancy. 'The court was referred to two paragraphs in training manuals - that clearly had not been sufficient training. 'The court is also troubled by the use of student paramedics on emergency calls like this one. 'This has been a most sad case. 'The evidence has been most disturbing and harrowing to hear.' The 999 lottery: It emerged half the East of England Ambulance Service was staffed by trainees that night . Grieving sister Paula Chapman has slammed the 'lottery of dialling 999', telling the court the condition was 'preventable'. Speaking after an inquest at Chelmsford . Coroners’ Court today her sister Mrs Chapman, 37, said: 'People need to . know the lottery of dialling 999. An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, in a fallopian tube. In this state, the egg will not develop into a baby and could have devastating consequences for the mother's health. With few noticeable symptoms, it is common for the condition to go unnoticed until detected by a routine test. If it is not detected, the mother will likely suffer from heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, and dizziness at any point between five and 14 weeks of pregnancy. If the egg grows and ruptures the fallopian tube, she will experience sudden and severe pain, feeling faint or dizzy, vomiting, diarrhoea, and shoulder pain. This is a medical emergency. It is a signal that the mother is suffering life-threatening internal bleeding. 'Half the ambulances won’t have a trained paramedic on them. 'If the ambulance service think this is acceptable then they need to tell people. 'My sister had a serious but preventable condition - she just needed urgent surgery. 'We’re heartbroken but pleased the coroner found significant failings at the ambulance trust.' Shocking evidence from ambulance bosses revealed half the ambulances on call on the night of Mrs Glenister’s death were crewed entirely by trainee paramedics. Ambulance trainee Mark Nelmes told the court he and a student colleague had arrived at the home in Great Wakering, Essex, at 7.29pm on April 11, 2011, and began making observations at 7.35pm. Observations continued until 8.09pm before they drove to the hospital without emergency lights and sirens, claiming he feared using them might 'increase the patient’s anxiety'. Following the 15-minute journey, the crew queued up behind other ambulances, unaware of the medical emergency at hand. Mrs . Glenister, who worked as a bank manager, was declared dead shortly . after arrival at Southend Hospital at 9.58pm the same evening. Mr Nelmes admitted that he had only been . training for a year and his knowledge of ectopic pregnancies was . restricted to two brief paragraphs in training manuals. The paramedics failed to alert Southend Hospital of the emergency and waited in a 'not urgent' queue . He conceded that he did not have the same level of knowledge as a paramedic but claimed he had followed his training by carrying out two sets of observations before taking the patient to hospital. A post-mortem revealed Mrs Glenister had lost four litres of blood in her abdominal area after suffering a rupture of the fallopian tubes in what pathologist Dr Ian Caulder described as an 'acute medical surgical emergency'. A number of Mrs Glenister’s family, including widower Nigel Glenister, attended the second and concluding day of the inquest today.","Trudy Glenister, 38, lost 4 litres of blood in wait to reach Southend Hospital .

"By . Sam Greenhill . Scores of Syrian refugees have occupied the Calais ferry terminal and are threatening to kill themselves unless they are granted passage to Britain. A dozen are on hunger strike and two yesterday vowed to leap off the roof of the terminal building unless their demands were met. They said they were treated ‘like dogs’ by the French authorities but believed they would be lavished with benefits if they reached the UK. Scroll down for video . Hunger strike: Some of the Syrians occupying a footbridge at the Calais ferry terminal yesterday . Stand off: French CRS riot police stand guard as Syrian asylum seekers hold their position behind a banner on a footbridge at the ferry terminal in Calais . Sit in: Policemen stand watch as two refugees sit on the edge of the roof of the terminal building at Calais . About 60 Syrian refugees, of whom 40 are on a hunger strike, have occupied a key point in the northern French port . A policeman stands guard as the refugees vowed to stay put until they are sent to Britain . Unlike Britain, France does not pay benefits to asylum seekers while their claims are being processed. About 40 Syrians have refused to move from a passenger gangway. When French riot police tried to clear them yesterday, two men climbed on to the roof of the ferry ticket hall and threatened to jump. Others erected placards reading: ‘We want to start a new life in England’ and ‘We want to talk to David Cameron’. Talks: An interpreter speaks with a group of refugees at Calais . Setting up camp: The refugees have rigged a tarpaulin cover on one of the footbridges at Calais to keep them sheltered from the elements . A spokesman for Calais port said there was 'no disruption to ferry services' so far caused by the protest. Many said Britain was a ‘better’ place to settle, despite Syria’s close historical links with France. Ali, 38, said that despite French President Francois Hollande’s strong stance against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, the French were not welcoming. ‘Here even animals are better treated than us,’ he said. Father-of-six Zakarya Sheikh Kelo (pictured) has walked, driven and flown across Europe to escape Syria – but says he will not stop until he gets to Britain. Once here, the 45-year-old English teacher plans to bring the rest of his family  to join him. He fled the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo on September 10 with his wife and six children, aged five to 18, and crossed the border on foot into Turkey. He left his family there and paid a gang of people-smugglers his life savings,  worth £9,000, to take him to Britain. Mr Kelo said: ‘I refuse any country but England. I chose England because the procedures are quicker to get  asylum, and once I am there it is easier to bring my whole family too.’ But he and fellow refugees were double-crossed by the people-smugglers, who took them to France instead. ‘From across the border, I was taken by a taxi to Istanbul, and from there put on a flight. 'They said it was to London, but it landed in  Paris … Since then I have tried ten times to get on trucks going to England but every time they [the French police] found me.’ Tarik, 19, added: ‘We live outside like dogs, hunted down by the police. We see we are not welcome. How can we seek asylum here?’ One of the refugees, father-of-six Zakarya Sheikh Kelo, 45, described escaping Syria via Turkey and then catching a flight to Paris before travelling by bus to Calais. He said Turkey and France were both ‘safe’ but demanded to be allowed on to Britain, where he could apply for his family to join him. Philippe Wannesson, from a group working with refugees in Calais, said a growing number of Syrians were arriving in the town wanting to reach the UK. ‘A year ago we saw perhaps only two, three or four,’ he said. ‘Since March or April it has been rising to 20, 30, 40 and steadily growing.’ The UK Border Force denied claims that two of its officials were at the port ‘negotiating’ with the protesters. A spokesman said they were there ‘purely in a supporting role’. However, the mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, demanded action at Westminster. ‘The British must make a decision,’ she said. ‘It is unacceptable that it is in France and at Calais that one has to control immigration.’ The group has been occupying the ferry terminal since Wednesday, although crossings are not being disrupted, a port spokesman said. The dozen hunger strikers have vowed to continue their protest. Last night, one of them fainted and was taken away by ambulance. Another of the group hung up another cardboard placard, bearing the slogan: ‘Britain is a fair country, and that is why we want to go there – we will be treated well by the British government.’ Dr Martina Devries, of Medecins du Monde, a medical charity supporting the refugees, said: ‘These people are not being helped by the French government, which does not give them food or clothes or shelter. ‘The French police persecute them, moving them on all the time. There are about 40 men and ten women, including one who is seven months pregnant, and seven children. ‘They don’t want to stay in France, and they are increasingly desperate and determined to get to the UK. Syria has close historical links with France, which has promised to speed up asylum claims from those who have escaped the Civil War . Keeping watch: Many of the refugees said Britain was a ¿better¿ place to settle, despite Syria¿s close historical links with France . ‘They have been trying to get on to trains and trucks, and even swimming across the harbour to board ferries.’ Denis Robin, the prefect of the Pas-de-Calais region, said the Syrians had a ‘95 per cent chance of success’ if they applied for asylum in France. The United Nations refugee agency said France has offered to take in 10,000 Syrians. The war to oust President Assad has forced two million refugees to flee to neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. The brutal war in Syria has claimed more than 100,000 lives since it started in early 2011 . Seventeen countries are liaising with the United Nations to receive quotas of refugees fleeing war .","A dozen refugees are on hunger strike at the Calais ferry terminal .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Would you live in a parking space-sized house? That’s what one group of students are hoping will solve the housing crisis. Their unique invention could provide urban dwellers with alternative living arrangements. No place like home? The Savannah College of Art and Design has unveiled their miniature houses, called SCADpads, that they say could solve the housing crisis . SCAD stands for the Savannah College of Art and Design, a private university with locations in Atlanta, Georgia in the US, and also Hong Kong and France. The world’s urban population is currently 3.5 billion. It is expected to hit 5 billion by 2035. 81% of the US population lives in urban areas. But there is already a shortage of housing for people in populous cities. There are apparently 105 million parking spaces in the US. That is apparently five spaces for every car. Half of all spaces are vacant 40% of the time. These, the university says, can be used to solve the housing crisis by filling them with SCADpads. It was students from Savannah in Atlanta that came up with this design when they were tasked with making use of a five-storey car park. They came up with these mini-houses that are not only small enough to fit in a parking space but also affordable, each costing an estimated £24,000 (£40,000) to build. ‘As the housing shortage in crowded cities becomes increasingly apparent, President Paul Wallace and SCAD designers have answered the call with the university’s boldest innovation yet,’ the university said in a statement. ‘Branded as a luxury product, SCADpad features an individualised interior, interactive controls and green amenities. ‘The micro homes feature custom exterior and interior elements, modular wall systems, automated home control, sustainable waste management and multifunctional, multipurpose 3-D printed furniture.’ A few students in Atlanta have been selected to trial the SCADpads for a few days to give feedback on the miniature homes. Each of the homes contains all the amenities you’d expect to find in a regular house. The 135-sq ft residences are surprisingly spacious and include a toilet, bed, desk and kitchen. Ultimately, it’s hoped that multiple SCADpads can be used to create small housing communities in unused parking lots. While only in prototype phase at the moment, the university hopes that in future vacant parking lots can be filled with these miniature homes to solve the housing crisis . Each SCADpad comes with most of the things you'd expect from a full-sized home including a desk, bed, bathroom and kitchen . Big problem, tiny solution? Each SCADpad is 8 feet wide and 16 feet long, small enough to fit in a parking space . All electronics in the SCADpad are controlled through an iPad. Lighting can be changed from a deep blue to a bright orange. The windows can be frosted and unfrosted to give you privacy or scenery when you need it. The shelving within is 3D-printed. Some of the homes have interactive wallpaper that plays music when it’s touched. The houses heat up quickly, so not much energy is needed to keep them warm. There is also a filtration system tied into the shower and sink. The windows can't be opened, but the SCADpads do have air conditioning and ventilation fans. According to the university, the global urban population will hit 5 billion people in the next two decades, while 81 per cent of the U.S. population lives in urban areas. But, they say, the world’s most populous cities are struggling to cope with this influx of people and there is a shortage of suitable housing. This project is designed to address the problem by utilising space that is otherwise going unnoticed, in car parks. Three pilot SCADpads have now been developed in a process that took 10 months. But, the university says each unit could eventually be constructed in one to two months. Three 'model homes' are on display at the moment, when they will be lived in by students for a few days to give feedback on what it's like to live in the enclosed spaces .","University students in Atlanta have designed mini-houses for urban living .

"By . Darren Boyle . Seren-Rose Davis (right) with her brother Jacob (left) who is donating his bone marrow to save his sister's life . A baby boy is set to become a life saver before his first birthday by donating bone marrow to his older sister who suffers from an incredibly rare illness. Little Jacob Davis, who is just 10 months old, will undergo the operation in a bid to help his sister, Seren-Rose, two. Seren-Rose, of West Mersea, Essex, is one of just 150 youngsters in the UK to suffer from the condition known as mucopolysaccharidosis. The disease has left her with  with brain damage and learning difficulties. The condition slows a child's development and as a result the toddler is still unable to speak. It is more commonly known as Hurler's disease. Unfortunately, the bone marrow transplant will not cure Seren-Rose but it could help prevent her health deteriorate further. Her parents, Simon and Elouise, were devastated to discover they were not suitable matches for their young daughter but it emerged that Jacob is a match. The life-changing transplant is now set to take place next month before Jacob’s first birthday. Mr Davis, 48, said: 'Jacob will grow up knowing he saved his sister’s life. We are elated - it is better if the marrow comes from a sibling rather than from another donor. 'The recovery time will be quicker and the chance of it ""taking"" is a lot higher.' Seren-Rose Davis suffers from mucopolysaccharidosis which is dramatically affecting her development . Seren-Rose Davis must stay in hospital for two months and requires chemotherapy before she can receive her brother Jacob's bone marrow . Seren-Rose has MPS I which is also known as Hurler disease. Hurler . disease takes its name from Gertrud Hurler, the doctor who first . described a boy and girl with the condition in 1919. Although there is no cure for MPS diseases, there are ways of managing and treating the problems they cause. Individuals with MPS disease are missing a key enzyme which means . incompletely broken down mucopolysaccharides remain stored in cells in . the body causing progressive damage to brain and body. Babies may show little sign of the disease, but as more and more cells become damaged, symptoms start to appear. Children with Hurler disease have progressive developmental delay and severe progressive physical problems. Seren-Rose will undergo Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation with . the blood stem cells taken from her brother Jacob’s bone marrow. The transplant does not repair damage already done but will stop the disease progressing further. Source - The MPS Society . Seren-Rose was only diagnosed with the incredibly rare condition in December 2013. Now, the youngster will have to undergo chemotherapy before she can be given her brother's bone marrow. She will be confined to hospital for two months with some of that time in strict isolation to reduce the risk of infection. Unfortunately, the transplant cannot repair the damage already done. Mrs Davis admitted it will be tough seeing her baby boy undergo the operation. She said: 'When I got the news that Jacob was a match, part of me was a little sad because I do not want him to undergo any discomfort. 'We’ve been told he will be sore for a couple of days. 'The way I look at it is, he will have a couple of days of soreness but he will have a lifetime of knowing he has given his sister the gift of life. 'I think when they grow up they will have a special bond. I am proud of both of them. 'I think Jacob will be very protective over her safety and really proud of what he has done for her.' The family has been supported by the MPS Society who provide advice for people suffering for mucopolysaccharide diseases. Mr Davis, who is a maintenance manager, will undertake a 24-hour radio broadcast next month to raise vital funds for the charity.","Just 150 children in Britain suffer the same genetic disease as Seren-Rose .

"By . Emma Innes . A 99-year-old great-grandmother has become the oldest person in Europe to have a hearing implant. Mollie Smith believes she lost her hearing after being exposed to German Zeppelins dropping bombs during the First World War. She says her hearing was badly damaged as a result of the bombing raids and she finally went deaf in both ears 29 years ago, when she was 70. Mollie Smith, 99, has become the oldest person in Europe to be fitted with a cochlear implant . Mrs Smith (pictured in her youth) began to lose her hearing when she was in her 70s before also losing her sight. As a result, she lost her independence and so jumped at the chance to have the implant . But she can now hear after having a cochlear implant – and will be able to hear her family sing Happy Birthday when she turns 100 in September. In January, Mrs Smith underwent the operation, which involves having the implant surgically placed under the skin of the head, and now tests have proved it was a success. It means Mrs Smith, who was born in 1914, is the oldest person in Europe to ever undergo the operation. A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that can help provide a sense of sound to a person who is deaf or severely hard of hearing. The implants cannot restore normal hearing but they can give a deaf person a good representation of sounds, meaning they can learn to understand speech again. Mrs Smith underwent the procedure at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after her daughter Rita, 77, contacted them last June. The cochlear implant was fitted in January and switched on last month so Mrs Smith will be able to hear in time for her 100th birthday in September . Today Mrs Smith, of Rugby, Warwickshire, told of her joy at being able to hear her grandchildren and great-grandson for the very first time. She said: ‘I have six grandchildren and one great-grandchild and to hear them chatter to me is wonderful. ‘They will all be here for my birthday in September and I can't wait to hear them sing to me, it really will be something special and something I never expected to happen. ‘This implant has really changed my life, I can now communicate with people without having to shout and let everyone else know my business.’ A cochlear implant is a surgically implanted electronic device that gives a person who is profoundly deaf a sense of sound. It will not cure deafness, but is a prosthetic substitute for hearing. The device is surgically implanted under a general anaesthetic and the procedure takes up to five hours. It involves making an incision in the skin and attaching the device through the bone behind the ear and into the inner ear. The devices receives sound, processes it, and sends small electric currents near the auditory nerve. The currents activate the nerve, which sends a signal to the brain, which the person comes to learn as hearing. Mrs Smith was born in Brigg, North Lincolnshire, in 1914 and believes she suffered irreparable hearing damage after being exposed to the droning sound of Zeppelins flying overhead. She believes this early damage contributed to her losing her hearing completely in later life. Mrs Smith, who is widowed, said: ‘I was born in Brigg and the Zeppelins came over a lot when I was a baby. My mother said this is why my hearing was damaged. ‘It feels great to be the oldest person in Europe to have this done and I really didn't think I would be eligible but the Queen Elizabeth Hospital were great and have given me a new lease of life. ‘I feel like I will carry on like this for another 50 years, that's how I feel at the moment, it is just lovely what has happened to me. ‘The implant is so clever, it is quite amazing, it adjusts to its surroundings so it will never be too loud or too quiet, it is always just right. ‘I had tinnitus and all I thought I could hear was breeze blowing through trees and that was the last thing I could hear before I went deaf. ‘I spent over £10,000 on hearing aids in the past that just haven't worked and now it is brilliant to finally hear again, I really have missed it.’ Mrs Smith worked as a motorbike dispatch rider during the Second World War and worked as a dog trainer until she became deaf in 1985. Her daughter, Rita, who is her full time carer, said: ‘Mum has always been active, she goes to the gym with me and loves the treadmill and rowing machine. ‘This operation has changed her life as well as mine, it used to be a nightmare having to communicate with her when we were out, everyone would hear us shouting. Mrs Smith (pictured when she was young) hopes the implant will enable her to regain her independence . Mrs Smith (right, with a friend) will not regain her normal hearing as a result of the implant but it will send signals to her auditory nerve which can then be interpreted by the brain . ‘She did learn to lip read but it still wasn't good enough to hold a full conversation and she couldn't hear herself properly so would shout a lot. ‘Even when we were together I would have to write everything down so it was very time consuming, although now, it is perfect, everything is so much easier for everyone. ‘She is really looking forward to her birthday in September, we will have family and friends round and put up a gazebo in the garden, she can't wait to hear people, especially the grandkids, sing her Happy Birthday for the first time.’ Andrew Reid, consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon who carried out the implant on Mrs Smith, said: ‘The intent was to improve her hearing and allow her to maintain a level of independent living. ‘This sort of thing is possible for older people because of modern-day skills of anaesthesia and nursing care.’ The oldest person in the world to have a cochlear implant is Jack Walley who is 102.","Mollie Smith's hearing was damaged by the noise of Zeppelins in the War .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Scientists have successfully grown vaginas in a laboratory and implanted them into four teenage patients. The new organs have been given to women born with MRKH - Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a rare genetic condition . in which the vagina and uterus are underdeveloped or absent. The . treatment could also potentially be applied to patients with vaginal . cancer or injuries, according to the U.S. researchers. Pioneering: Scientists have successfully grown vaginas in a laboratory and implanted them into patients born with a condition called MRKH - where the vagina and uterus are underdeveloped or absent . The organ structures were engineered using muscle and epithelial cells (the cells that line the body’s cavities) from a small biopsy of each patient’s external genitals. The cells were extracted from the tissues, expanded and then placed on a biodegradable material that was hand-sewn into a vagina-like shape. These scaffolds (pictued below) were tailor-made to fit each patient. About five to six weeks after the biopsy, surgeons created a canal in the patient’s pelvis and attached the scaffold to reproductive structures. At the same time the scaffolding material is being absorbed by the body, the cells lay down materials to form a permanent support structure – gradually replacing the engineered scaffold with a new organ. The researchers, from the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center's Institute for Regenerative Medicine, say four teenage girls have successfully received  vaginal organs that were engineered with their own cells. Writing in The Lancet, programme leader by Dr Anthony Atala, said: 'This pilot study is the first to demonstrate that vaginal organs can be constructed in the lab and used successfully in humans. 'This may represent a new option for patients who require vaginal reconstructive surgeries. In addition, this study is one more example of how regenerative medicine strategies can be applied to a variety of tissues and organs.' The girls were between 13 and 18 years old at the time of the surgeries, which were performed between June 2005 and October 2008. Data from annual follow-up visits show that even up to eight years after the surgeries, the organs had normal function. The vaginas were engineered using muscle and epithelial . cells (the cells that line the body's cavities) from a small biopsy of . each patient's external genitals. The cells were then extracted from the tissues, expanded and then . placed on a biodegradable material that was hand-sewn into a vagina-like . shape. These scaffolds were tailor-made to fit each patient. Yuanyuan Zhang demonstrates the process where four young women born with abnormal or missing vaginas were implanted with lab-grown versions made from their own cells . About . five to six weeks after the biopsy, surgeons created a canal in the . patient's pelvis and sutured the scaffold to reproductive structures. MRKH (Mayer Rokitansky Küster Hauser) is a congenital abnormality which affects one in 5,000 women in the UK. It is characterised by the absence of the vagina, womb  and cervix. Women . suffering from the condition will have normally functioning ovaries and . so will experience the normal signs of puberty but will not have . periods or be able to conceive. The external genatalia are completely normal which is why MRKH isn’t usually discovered until women are in their teenage years. It’s usually discovered when the woman tries to has sex or fails to get her period. Many . women are able to create a vaginal canal using dilation treatment, . which uses cylinder shaped dilators of different sizes to stretch the . muscles. However, if this is unsuccessful then surgery will be used to stretch the vaginal canal. Following treatment women are able to have intercourse and can have their eggs removed and fertilised to be used in surrogacy. Previous research in Dr Atala's lab has shown that . once cell-seeded scaffolds are implanted in the body, nerves and blood . vessels form and the cells expand and form tissue. At the same time the . scaffolding material is being absorbed by the body, the cells lay down . materials to form a permanent support structure – gradually replacing . the engineered scaffold with a new organ. Follow-up testing on the . lab-engineered vaginas showed the margin between native tissue and the . engineered segments was indistinguishable. In addition, the patients' responses to a Female Sexual Function . Index questionnaire showed they had normal sexual function after the . treatment, including desire and pain-free intercourse. ""Tissue biopsies, MRI scans and internal exams using magnification all showed that the engineered vaginas were similar in makeup and function to native tissue, said Atlantida-Raya Rivera, lead author and director of the HIMFG Tissue Engineering Laboratory in Mexico City, where the surgeries were performed. Current treatments for MRHK syndrome include dilation of existing tissue or reconstructive surgery to create new vaginal tissue. A variety of materials can be used to surgically construct a new vagina – from skin grafts to tissue that lines the abdominal cavity. However, these substitutes often lack a normal muscle layer and some patients can develop a narrowing or contracting of the vagina. The researchers say that with conventional treatments, the overall complication rate is as high as 75 percent in paediatric patients, with the need for vaginal dilation due to narrowing being the most common complication.","The new organs given to women born with a condition called MRKH .

"By . Mark Prigg . Scientists have reconstructed one of the biggest asteroid impacts ever to hit Earth - and say it was six times as big as the blast than wiped out the dinosaurs. The 36 mile wide asteroid is believed to have hit Earth 3.26 billion years ago, creating unique geological features found in a South African region known as the Barberton greenstone belt. Researcher say the impact would have boiled oceans, burned the sky, and cause the planet to shake for 30 minutes. The massive asteroid was almost as wide as Rhode Island and about three to five times larger than the rock thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs. The huge impactor – between 37 and 58 kilometers (23 to 36 miles) wide – collided with the planet at 20 kilometers per second (12 miles per second). The jolt, bigger than a 10.8 magnitude earthquake, propelled seismic waves hundreds of kilometers through the Earth, breaking rocks and setting off other large earthquakes. Tsunamis thousands of meters deep – far bigger than recent tsunamis generated by earthquakes — swept across the oceans that covered most of the Earth at that time. The collision punched a crater into the planet’s crust that’s nearly 500 kilometers (about 300 miles) across: greater than the distance from Washington, D.C. to New York City, and up to two and a half times larger in diameter than the hole formed by the dinosaur-killing asteroid. Seismic waves bigger than any recorded earthquakes shake the planet for about half an hour at any one location – about six times longer than the huge earthquake that struck Japan three years ago. The impact also sets off tsunamis many times deeper than the one that followed the Japanese quake. Although scientists had previously hypothesized enormous ancient impacts, much greater than the one that may have eliminated the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, now a new study reveals the power and scale of a cataclysmic event some 3.26 billion years ago which is thought to have created geological features found in a South African region known as the Barberton greenstone belt. The research has been accepted for publication in Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, a journal of the American Geophysical Union. The collision punches a crater into the planet¿s crust that¿s nearly 500 kilometers (about 300 miles) across: greater than the distance from Washington, D.C. to New York City, and up to two and a half times larger in diameter than the hole formed by the dinosaur-killing asteroid. The sky would have become red hot, the atmosphere would have been filled with dust and the tops of oceans would have boiled, the researchers said. The impact sent vaporized rock into the atmosphere, which encircled the globe and condensed into liquid droplets before solidifying and falling to the surface, according to the researchers. Tsunamis thousands of meters deep – far bigger than recent tsunamis generated by earthquakes — swept across the oceans that covered most of the Earth at that time. The huge impactor – between 37 and 58 kilometers (23 to 36 miles) wide – collided with the planet at 20 kilometers per second (12 miles per second). The jolt, bigger than a 10.8 magnitude earthquake, propelled seismic waves hundreds of kilometers through the Earth, breaking rocks and setting off other large earthquakes. Tsunamis thousands of meters deep – far bigger than recent tsunamis generated by earthquakes — swept across the oceans that covered most of the Earth at that time. 'We knew it was big, but we didn’t know how big,' Donald Lowe, a geologist at Stanford University and a co-author of the study, said of the asteroid. Lowe, who discovered telltale rock formations in the Barberton greenstone a decade ago, thought their structure smacked of an asteroid impact. The new research models for the first time how big the asteroid was and the effect it had on the planet, including the possible initiation of a more modern plate tectonic system that is seen in the region, according to Lowe. The study marks the first time scientists have mapped in this way an impact that occurred more than 3 billion years ago, Lowe added, and is likely one of the first times anyone has modeled any impact that occurred during this period of the Earth’s evolution. The impact would have been catastrophic to the surface environment. The smaller, dino-killing asteroid crash is estimated to have released more than a billion times more energy than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The more ancient hit now coming to light would have released much more energy, experts said. Although scientists had previously hypothesized enormous ancient impacts, much greater than the one that may have eliminated the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, researchers have now modelled the power and scale of the cataclysmic event  for the first time . The crator covers an areas 500km wide . The impact may have been one of dozens of huge asteroids that scientists think hit the Earth during the tail end of the Late Heavy Bombardment period, a major period of impacts that occurred early in the Earth’s history – around 3 billion to 4 billion years ago. The study’s co-authors think the asteroid hit the Earth thousands of kilometers away from the Barberton Greenstone Belt, although they can’t pinpoint the exact location. 'We can’t go to the impact sites. In order to better understand how big it was and its effect we need studies like this,' said Lowe. The study’s findings have important implications for understanding the early Earth and how the planet formed. The impact may have disrupted the Earth’s crust and the tectonic regime that characterized the early planet, leading to the start of a more modern plate tectonic system, according to the paper’s co-authors. The pummeling the planet endured was 'much larger than any ordinary earthquake,' said Norman Sleep, a physicist at Stanford University and co-author of the study. He used physics, models, and knowledge about the formations in the Barberton greenstone belt, other earthquakes and other asteroid impact sites on the Earth and the moon to calculate the strength and duration of the shaking that the asteroid produced. Using this information, Sleep recreated how waves traveled from the impact site to the Barberton greenstone belt and caused the geological formations. The geological evidence found in the Barberton that the paper investigates indicates that the asteroid was “far larger than anything in the last billion years,' said Jay Melosh, a professor at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who was not involved in the research. The Barberton greenstone belt is an area 100 kilometers (62 miles) long and 60 kilometers (37 miles) wide that sits east of Johannesburg near the border with Swaziland. It contains some of the oldest rocks on the planet. The model provides evidence for the rock formations and crustal fractures that scientists have discovered in the Barberton greenstone belt, said Frank Kyte, a geologist at UCLA who was not involved in the study. 'This is providing significant support for the idea that the impact may have been responsible for this major shift in tectonics,' he said.","36 mile wide asteroid is believed to have hit Earth 3.26 billion years ago .

"By . Deni Kirkova . She first got drunk aged 10, and at her lowest point swallowed paint stripper to get high - but even that couldn't stop her. Recovering alcoholic Jackie Ellis from Port Talbot warns it was all too easy to become addicted. The mother-of-two says drinking 'crept up' on her, spiralling from once a week sessions to round the clock. But now Jackie, 50, has started her first job in 15 years after beating drug and alcohol dependency. Jackie Ellis aged 50, has just started her first job in 15 years after battling drug and alcohol dependency . At her worst Jackie was downing 16 cans of lager and between half and one whole bottle of vodka each day. 'I lost my husband, friends, my family, my self-respect and my confidence,' she recalls. She hit the bottle after miscarrying twin girls aged 25. Within three years the former supermarket cashier was drinking all day and passing out in the afternoon before drinking again through the night. 'I started drinking once a week then . twice then three times. Then I thought it was OK as long as I wasn't . drinking in the day,' she admits. 'One day, when I was feeling dreadful with a hangover, I thought I would have hair of the dog at 2pm and that became a pattern.' She admits her sons, now 29 and 33, were only clothed and fed with help from her parents and even being rushed to hospital with a burst stomach after downing paint stripper 10 years ago didn't stop her drinking. Jackie was drinking all day and passing out in the afternoon before drinking again through the night . It wasn't until younger sister Carole died four years ago aged 32 that Jackie, then 46, decided to stop. She was shocked when Carole, also a drinker, collapsed with a burst ulcer and doctors later found she had had sclerosis. 'I do believe my sister saved me,' says Jackie. 'I thought if I don't do something about it I'll be next.' A week after the funeral Jackie went to her GP for help and was referred to the Welsh Centre for Action on Dependency and Addiction. They helped her get dry and now, after 15 years unemployed, Jackie is starting her first job with help from Workways, an EU-funded local council project to help long-term jobless back to work. 'WCADA saved me,' says Jackie, 'They helped me so much. I can't thank them enough.' After . decades of heavy drinking she had to cut down rather than stop drinking . suddenly and got support with group therapy, counselling and voluntary . work organised by WCADA. Then last year Jackie, who has been re-united with her sons since going teetotal, was referred to back-to-work project Workways, where mentor Paul Billington helped persuade her to do work experience. After volunteering in the kitchens at WCADA she embarked on a voluntary mentoring role to help others fighting substance misuse. Earlier this month, Jackie started working in the organisation's Bridgend office as a peer mentor. Although she's not supposed to tell clients about her past, she says she does if they ask and it's something she has to face, . 'It was who I was,' she says. 'I can't describe how amazing it feels now. I have got my self-respect back and I'm a decent person again. 'I'm in contact with my sons again and friends, that's the best bit. I'm too busy to drink.' She finally quite when her sister - also a drinker - died. She collapsed with a burst ulcer at just 32 . Jackie even has a new partner, something she never dreamed would happen. 'I would hardly recognise Jackie as the person I first met a year ago,' says Paul. 'She's a very good example of how far you can come. It's fantastic and it's been a privilege working with her.' The Workways back-to-work project to help long-term unemployed, that helped Jackie, is run by Neath Port Talbot Council in collaboration with Bridgend Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire and Swansea councils. It is funded by the EU Social Fund through the Welsh Government.","Jackie Ellis, 50, from Port Talbot hit the bottle after miscarrying twins at 25 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Tales of sea serpents have haunted intrepid explorers and seasoned sailors for hundreds of years. And now a rare fish seldom seen by humans that has an incredibly long, undulating body, has been caught on camera. Oarfish, Regalecus glesne, are the world’s longest bony fish but evidence of their existence deep beneath the waves is only known about by a handful of videos and drawings, as well as specimens of the dead creatures that have washed up on beaches over the years. Scroll down for video . In awe: Oarfish, Regalecus glesne (pictured) are the world's longest bony fish but evidence of their existence deep beneath the waves is only known about by a handful of videos and specimens of the dead creatures that have washed up on beaches over the years . Regalecus glesne, is the world’s longest bony fish and can grow up to 56ft (17metres) long. The oarfish is seldom seen by humans as it typically lives between 650ft and 3,000ft (198 metres and 914 metres) below the waves. The one spotted in the Sea of Cortés, Mexico measured around 15ft (4.5metres) long. When the creatures swim into shallow waters they tend to die soon afterwards as they only expose themselves in such a way when they are injured or dying. The fish’s dorsal fin runs the entire length of its body, which one researcher has claimed can give off electric shocks. Oarfish can be found in almost all temperate and tropical oceans but are rarely seen. They are thought to be the ‘sea serpents’ described in old stories. Now a video has surfaced of a 15ft (4.5metre) long oarfish swimming in the shallows of Mexico’s Sea of Cortés crystal clear waters. It was taken by experts on a trip organised by Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium, PopSci reported. While the animal is not the largest specimen to be seen, there is little video footage available for living oarfish for scientists to study, as the creatures typically live between 650ft and 3,000ft (198 metres and 914 metres) below the waves where there is little light. Oarfish can grow up to 56ft (17 metres) long and have a distinctive dorsal fin that sticks up out of the water in the video. Like a fish out of water: A video has surfaced of a 15ft (4.5metre) long oarfish, swimming effortlessly in the shallows of Mexico's Sea of Cortez crystal clear waters - far from its usual environment of deep waters thousands of metres below the waves . The creature’s swimming action sees it rhythmically undulating smoothly and historians think that the animal is probably the source of stories about sea serpents. Its dorsal fin begins just above the creature’s small eyes in a reddish crest and runs the entire length of its body. Researchers from New Zealand have claimed that it can give off electric shocks when touched. Oarfish can be found in most of the world’s temperate and tropical oceans, but are hardly ever seen. They eat plankton and tiny shrimp, jellyfish and crustaceans and are themselves hunted by large oceanic carnivores. The video, which was taken by experts from Chicago's Shedd Aquarium, shows a 15ft long oarfish swimming in shallow water close to humans in a canoe (pictured). The fish are seldom seen by humans . Stuff of legend: The creature's swimming action sees it rhythmically undulating smoothly and historians think that the animal might be the source of stories about sea serpents. This image  of 'a great sea serpent' looks like an oarfish and was found in Hungary Bay, Bermuda centuries ago .","The shy fish was caught on camera in the shallow, crystal clear waters of Mexico’s Sea of Cortés - a far cry from its usual home in deep waters .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A breakthrough technology that can create 'virtual babies' by digitally combining the DNA of two people is set to launch. These virtual babies can then be screened . for genetic diseases, before ruling out sperm donors or partners who could pose a risk to . a potential baby’s health. Dubbed Matchright, the technology could . allow prospective parents to assess genetic risks even before a child is conceived. New York-based group, Genepeeks, is about to launch a service in the U.S. capable of digitally combining the DNA of two people to create 'virtual babies' The idea behind the technology came around six years ago when founder Anne Morriss, from New York, received a terrifying call. When her baby was just a few days old, Ms Morriss was asked by a stranger over the phone to check whether the child was still alive. ‘Can you go check and confirm and come back to the phone?’ the voice insisted. In shock Ms Morriss did just that. When she returned, the caller . revealed that her son – conceived using a sperm donor - had tested . positive for an inherited disorder called MCADD, . MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar and it can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early. This was the moment that Ms Morriss’ life changed. According to a report in the Boston Globe, her shock at not knowing about the sperm donor’s genetic disorder prompted her to start a company, Genepeeks. Dubbed Matchright, the technology could allow prospective parents to assess the risks of genetic disease without having to have a real pregnancy from which to extract the DNA . The $1,995 (£1,200) works by first screening the prospective donors or parents for any genetic disorders, which involves sequencing their DNA. Algorithms are then fed this data and use it to digitally recreate the process of genetic recombination – which is the mixing of genetic information between a sperm and an egg. This produces up to 10,000 simulated embryos per pairing, which are all sequenced to look for mutations in single genes that can cause 500 rare diseases. Computer software can then to work out the disease probability in the digital child and the client will get a list of ‘safe’ donors from which to choose. Other companies are already able screen partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant. But Genepeeks' new Matchright system is thought to be around 100,000 times more powerful that this technique, known as carrier screening. The $1,995 system (£1,200) works by first screening prospective donors or parents for any genetic disorders, which usually involves sequencing the DNA.

The $1,995 (£1,200) works by first screening the prospective donors or parents for any genetic disorders, which usually involves sequencing the DNA . The company's founders said they plan to expand the screening process beyond single-gene recessive disorders to more complex conditions. In theory, the technology could be used to screen potential babies for traits other than diseases. It would also fall outside rules used to regulate embryo testing and screening. The practice has raised some ethical questions about the prospect of ‘designer babies’. The technology's patent includes a list of traits that aren't necessarily related to health – such as eye and skin pigmentation, according to a report by Catherine de Lange in New Scientist. ‘Where it is more ethically challenging is when you expand beyond couples in desperate need for a donor, to couples that are just interested in more trivial things,’ Dagan Wells at the University of Oxford told the magazine. Professor Silver said that they are still undecided about what the patent will be used for in the future. He added that owning the patent means the firm can prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.","New York-based Genepeeks is about to launch a service in the U.S. capable of digitally .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Eating a daily portion of rice not only makes dieting easier, but is linked to improved all-round health. New research shows that consumers can improve their diets simply by enjoying white or brown rice as part of their daily meals. In a study published journal Food and Nutrition Sciences, study leader Dr Theresa Nicklas, of Baylor College of Medicine, looked at rice intake and diets among more than 14,000 US adults. Researchers studied the rice intake of more than 14,000 US adults . She said: 'Our results show that adults who eat rice had diets more consistent with what is recommended in dietary guidelines, and they showed higher amounts of potassium, magnesium, iron, folate and fibre while eating less saturated fat and added sugars. 'Eating rice is also associated with eating more servings of fruit, vegetables, meat and beans.' Rice is naturally sodium free and has only a small amount of fat, of which none is saturated. In addition to the positive results in studies linking rice consumption with healthier diets, a human clinical trial found that having white or brown rice at a meal increased feelings of fullness more than a calorically equivalent glucose solution control. The study found that increasing rice intake not only improved general health but also aided dieting as it made people feel more full . Considering the cross-sectional and clinical findings, both enriched white rice and whole grain brown rice should be recommended as part of a healthy diet, said the researchers. They added that rice provides about 100 calories per half-cup cooked serving and is naturally free of gluten. Brown rice is a 100 percent whole grain food and white rice is enriched with important nutrients, including folic acid and iron. Both enriched white rice and whole grain brown rice are considered nutrient-rich quality complex carbohydrates and can be part of a sustainable, plant-based diet that promotes optimal health. Enriched white rice contributes more than 15 vitamins and minerals, including folate and other B vitamins, iron and zinc to the diet. Brown rice is slightly higher in dietary fibre, magnesium and phosphorus, but lower in B vitamins and iron than enriched, fortified white rice. Rice is naturally low in sodium and cholesterol free and contains traces of fat and no saturated or trans fats. Researchers said both white and brown rice produced health benefits .","Rice is naturally low in sodium and contains no cholesterol or trans fats .

"By . Carol Driver . A council has been accused of wrecking a popular Easter holiday beach after it dumped 100 Christmas trees on it as part of an anti-erosion project. The firs were stripped of their fairies and planted on Porthtowan, Cornwall, in January to help build a defence against pounding waves. But residents – who have been threatened with legal action if they remove them - fear the eyesore will be damaging to the tourist trade, which is ‘vital’ to the local economy, over the long weekend. Sea defence: The Christmas trees were planted in January as part of an anti-erosion plan . No-go area: 100 Christmas trees have been dumped on the beach in Porthtowan, Cornwall . Branching out: Sunbathers use the dumped Christmas trees as barriers on the Cornish beach . Cornwall Council said the trees would bind with the shingle and form a defence line of new dunes to stop the beach being eroded by waves. But the Porthtowan Dunes Community Group say the plan has failed, leaving the battered and weather-beaten Christmas trees sticking out of the sand. They claim it will make the beach a laughing stock when holidaymakers arrive this Easter. 'Damaging': Locals fear the trees will prevent tourists from visiting the beach over the Easter break . Rows of trees: The firs were planted as part of a eco campaign by Cornwall Council . Threat to tourism: Youngsters play near the Christmas trees on the beach today . Frustrated locals wanted to dig up . the Christmas trees themselves but were threatened with legal action if . they carried out ‘unauthorised’ work. Residents say many of the trees simply blew away in winter storms, littering village roads and gardens with branches and debris. Those . that remained have gradually turned orange and died, leaving pine . needles and splinters scattered across the golden sand, creating a . hazard for bare feet. Local residents helped to plant the Christmas trees on the beach at Porthtowan in January . Dumped Christmas trees: Locals fear the discoloured firs will put off tourists from visiting the Cornish beach . Eco-campaign: The council's green move has backfired, with locals wanting to remove the trees . Rose Trengove, community group spokesman, said: ‘We were told by the council's dunes expert that the Christmas trees would be covered by sand come April. ‘We wanted to see if it would work, but it hasn't and is now an eyesore and a blight.’ The . council has banned villagers - who were encouraged to take their . Christmas trees to be planted on the beach in January – from taking them from the beach. A plan to hold a community event to remove the trees was stopped at the last minute after Cornwall Council stepped in. Outrage: Residents Anne Corrigan and Alison Mills wander around the trees which they fear will deter tourists . An 'eyesore': Old Christmas trees can be seen poking out of the sand on the West Country beach . Eyesore: The dead trees were planted in rows on the beach to form a defence line of new dunes . A letter from countryside officer Jolyon Sharpe warned members of the Porthtowan Beach Management Group they could face legal action if they pushed ahead. It read: ‘If the group feel that it is appropriate to act independently of Cornwall Council it will have to consider its options regarding taking action to prevent such unauthorised interference and any appropriate recompense. ‘I would sincerely hope that we can work together to ensure the most appropriate outcome for this area and that the Council will not have to resort to such a response.’ Eco-plan: The Council planted the trees on the beach in January to form a defence line of new dunes . 'Alienating visitors': The Christmas trees will prevent tourists from visiting, according to locals . Luke Morris, who runs the Blue Bar . yards from the straggly stumps, said the trees are now 'an eyesore on . what is a fantastic beach'. He added: ‘It's alienating visitors at a time when Cornwall, as a whole, needs as much support as it can get.’ The council claimed in January that the trees would act as 'wind traps' and allow grass to grow and bind the sand together, to stop the beach being gradually washed away by storms. Beach life: The dead trees were planted by the council to stop sand being blown inland . Making do: Local residents are still using the Cornish beach but fear tourists will stay away this weekend . Cornwall Councillor Joyce Duffin said ‘I can't comment if the trees are or are not working, though I think they are trapping some of the sand.’ About the villagers' threat to uproot the trees, she warned: ‘They would need to have permission because it's council land.’ Secluded Porthtowan has a long-standing problem with sandstorms being whipped up the sea, damaging local homes and businesses. Cost-efficient plan: 100 trees were planted after the festive season in a bid to stablise the sand dunes . Hazard: The Christmas trees have shed prickly pine needles over the popular Cornish beach . Cornwall Council's Natural Environment Manager Jon James said the authority was in talks with experts about what to do next. He said: ‘We do not want to take any action which could be detrimental to the protection of properties, so we are seeking independent expert advice from a specialist company to fully understand what works are required for the long-term future and stability of the dune system and to determine the best course of action. ‘The recent storms which Cornwall has suffered has clearly demonstrated the importance of the dune systems in protecting Cornwall's coastline and we need to ensure that all parties take a measured approached to ensure that we retain the best level of protection to communities.’","Council said the firs would bind with the sand and form a defence line of new dunes to stop the beach being eroded .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Have you ever wanted to see what lies at the bottom of the sea? Well, now you can, thanks to a live stream provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They’ve unveiled the real-time video footage from a new deep-sea mission, letting you ride along for the rest of the expedition. Live footage immediately below . Last week the Okeanos Explorer vessel set out on its expedition. Until 1 May it will be mapping and observing a region in the Gulf of Mexico. Here it has also been deploying a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) named Deep Discoverer. This is the third part of a 59-day expedition that is gathering data from areas of special interest on the sea floor identified by the scientific community. February 24 – Leg 1 mapping transit from North Kingstown, Rhode Island, with transit mapping operations conducted en route to the Gulf of Mexico. March 4 – Primary mapping operations started at the southwest Florida Escarpment in the Gulf of Mexico. March 15 – Leg 1 in Galveston, Texas concluded. March 19  – The Okeanos Explorer departed Galveston to begin Leg 2. March 20 – Started primary Leg 2 mapping operations in the Northwest Gulf of Mexico. April 3 – Concluded Leg 2 in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Mobilized for Leg 3. April 10 – Depart Pascagoula and commenced transit to the Northwest Gulf of Mexico operating area. April 12 – First Leg 3 remote operating vehicle (ROV) dive. April 24 – Last ROV dive in Northwest Gulf of Mexico. Commence transit to West Florida Escarpment. April 26 – First ROV dive at the West Florida Escarpment. April 31 – Last ROV dive of Leg 3. May 1 – Ship arrives in St. Petersburg, Florida; Leg 3 ends. These areas are being mapped by the Okeanos Explorer while the Deep Discoverer dives underwater to observe interesting features. These will include cold seeps, deep coral communities, undersea canyons, shipwrecks and possibly also mud volcanos and brine pools. ‘Despite its importance to U.S. national energy, food, transportation and recreational economies, and decades of exploration; significant gaps remain in our basic understanding of the deep Gulf of Mexico,’ the NOAA says of the expedition on their website. ‘In recent years, scientists and managers have identified poorly known areas in the Gulf of Mexico that are larger than the states of Connecticut, Delaware, and Rhode Island.’ ‘The 2014 Gulf of Mexico Expedition continues NOAA’s efforts with partners to reduce the unknown by conducting baseline ecosystem characterizations to support a variety of research, management, economic, and educational activities. The data collected by the expedition will, according to the NOAA, be used to provide  critical deep-ocean baseline environmental intelligence to governments, universities, corporations, non-governmental organizations and the public. ‘Our collaborative exploration approach utilizes telepresence technology to stream real-time video and data ashore,' the NOAA continues, 'allowing scientists, engineers, managers, and students to work together efficiently to characterize sites, learn from one another across disciplines, and share knowledge and new discoveries with anyone watching on the Internet.’ Via telepresence, live images from the seafloor and other science data will flow over satellite and high-speed Internet pathways to people around the world . The 2014 Gulf of Mexico Expedition is divided into three 'legs' that aim to map the sea floor using the Okeanos Explorer's deep-water mapping systems. The third leg started on 10 April and will continue until 1 May . The Okeanos Explorer, pictured, was previously a United States Navy Ship but in 2010 it was converted into an exploratory vessel for the NOAA . The NOAA's Okeanos Explorer Program has previously stumbled across remarkable finds such as this mid-19th Century wooden-hulled shipwreck that was found on the Gulf of Mexico seafloor in 2012 . This picture from the 2011 Galapagos Rift Expedition shows a remote operated vehicle (ROV) being recovered from the water at night, with the underwater glow created by the powerful lights on the Seirios camera sled that is also currently being used on the 2014 Gulf of Mexico Expedition .","An expedition to explore the Gulf of Mexico seafloor has begun .

"By . Tom Gardner . A photographer has captured the wondrous, miraculous moment of birth - in all its raw and unglamourised glory. Taken before a mother has seen her baby for the first time these amazing photographs show the reality of how we all enter this world. The warts and all pictures are the work of respected Danish photographer Suste Bonnen who was given unprecedented access to mothers while they were in labour. Intimate: Danish photographer Suste Bonnen captured the moments after a baby was born in a series of extraordinary portraits . Shock: Ms Bonnen said the controversial images are 'testimony to the magical wonder of life' Suste, 65, who has worked as a portrait . photographer for 30 years, was given permission to take these remarkable . shots at the Copenhagen University Hospital. Now she has produced this stunning body of portraits of perhaps the most exposed moment in any person's life. Her . compelling pictures show babies the instant they are born even before . they are given over to the safety of their mother's arms. Compelling: Ms Bonnen said she wanted to show the emotion of birth as a mother set eyes on her child for the first time . Miracle: The thought-provoking series of photographs show birth in excruciating detail . Suste said: 'A life-long theme for my portrait photography has always been the affection and love displayed between a mother and daughter, a father and a son, a brother and a sister. 'I have portrayed heads of states, politicians, celebrities and CEOs, but family is what have always interested me the most. 'What suddenly intrigued me, however, was if that feeling of love for life was detectable at first eyesight. What are we emotionally like at the earliest stage in life? What are we like at the very first second? Focus: Respected Danish photographer Suste Bonnen followed 22 caesarian operations in Copenhagen University Hospital . Illuminating: Photographer Suste Bonnen did not use special lighting only the lamps in the delivery ward to capture these fascinating and captivating portraits of child birth in Copenhagen University Hospital . 'When the idea arose, I was therefore lucky to get exclusive and unprecedented access to the maternity ward, where I followed more than 22 caesarean operations.' In the working world of the hospital Suste still managed to get great pictures despite having just the surgery lights to shine on her subjects - no flash was allowed.

"By . Martin Robinson . Anger: This poster led to North Korean officials demanding that the west London salon that produced it should take it down - they have now asked the Foreign Office to intervene . North Korean agents have demanded the Foreign Office intervene in their row with a London hairdresser who used a picture of Kim Jong-un to advertise its 15 per cent 'bad hair' discount. M&M Hair Academy in South Ealing sparked a diplomatic incident after it lampooned the dictator's unique hairstyle in a poster hung in its shop window. Owner Mo Nabbach said within 24 hours men in suits from the North Korean embassy two miles away arrived and demanded it was taken down - but he kept it up because 'this is a democracy'. The regime's staff in London have now written to William . Hague and asked him to take 'necessary action to stop the provocation' because the poster was 'disrespectful' of their 'Dear Leader'. 'We have received a letter from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's embassy about this issue,' a Foreign Office spokesman told MailOnline. A Government source added the 'short letter' had also been sent to Scotland Yard, who have already said that no crime has been committed. Enfield Tory MP David Burrowes, who is on the . parliamentary group on North Korea, told the Evening Standard: 'On the one hand their response is laughable. But . underlying is a more sinister undertone which is played out in North . Korea with people being locked up, killed and denied freedoms.' Kim Jong-un's hairstyle is the only one approved by the dictator. Last month all young men were told they should adopt his short back and sides with centre parting – or face severe punishment . But it emerged yesterday that his officials in London were not prepared to allow his appearance to be joked about and leapt furiously into action. Mo Nabbach chose the photograph specifically because Kim is a 'celebrity' and below the large image of the tyrant wrote: ‘Bad Hair Day? 15% off all gent cuts through the month of April’. Scroll down for video . Row: The owners of this London salon say their decision to promote an April discount using a picture of Kim Jong-un has led to the manager being put under surveillance by North Korean officials . It . had been in the salon window for only one day before he received a . sinister visit from the North Korean officials, whose embassy is less . than two miles away in a converted semi in Gunnersbury. They were apparently clutching clipboards and a camera. Mr Nabbach said: 'I noticed them first outside the shop. 'They came in and asked what the poster was doing in the window and demanded for it to be taken down. 'I . said it was only a poster and we have pictures of celebrities in the . window all the time. They said: ""This is no celebrity, it's our dear . leader"". 'They asked for . my name and I refused to give it to them, saying ""this is not North . Korea, this is England, and you can get out"". Later he told Scotland Yard that he feared for his livelihood in case North Korean officials 'ended up smashing the windows' when he went home. State headquarters: North Korea's embassy is based inside this semi in Gunnersbury, west London, and officials have asked the Foreign Office intervene in a row with a local barbers . The two men in suits entered the salon at 4.30pm last Friday bearing a clipboard. They confronted Mr Nabbach’s 26-year-old hairdresser son Karim, demanding to know who was responsible for the perceived outrage. ‘The irony is they didn’t even have the Kim Jong-un haircut, they just had a standard side parting,’ said Mr Nabbach, 51. ‘To tell you the truth, it was actually a bit scary. From all the stuff you hear about North Korea, it was worrying. The two guys were wearing suits and they were very serious. It was very threatening. They came in and asked what the poster was doing in the window and demanded for it to be taken down. - Salon owner Mo Nabbach . ‘I said it was only a poster and we have pictures of celebrities in the window all the time. ‘They . said, “We are North Korean officials, do you know this is our leader?”. They asked for my name. I told them, “This is not North Korea, this is . England, we live in a democracy so I’m afraid you’re going to have to . get out of my salon”.’ The pair left after taking notes and . photographs of the premises. Mr Nabbach went to Ealing police station to . report the matter. Scotland Yard revealed today the North Koreans did the . same. He initially removed the poster, fearing that either he or the shop could be targeted. But . following complaints from customers and locals about a ‘breach of . democracy’, the poster was put back up, prompting a further visit at . 10am the next day. A communist official stood outside taking photographs of the salon until Karim chased him off. Mr Nabbach took the poster down after the men left, but he has replaced it after comments on Facebook saying the request to take it down was a 'breach of democracy'.

"By . Mia De Graaf . An eight-year-old â€˜child brideâ€™ reported to have died of internal injuries on her wedding night is alive, it is claimed. Shocking reports emerged last week of a Yemeni girl called Rawan who died after being forced into marrying a man five times her age. The case sparked international outcry and enraged activists launched a campaign calling for the groom and the girl's family to be arrested. They said the Yemeni government must ban child marriages. However, the original report has been called into question after authorities in north western Yemen presented a girl to reporters that they said was Rawan, alongside a man claiming to be her father. Scroll down for video . Alive?: Yemeni 'child bride' said to have died on her wedding night has appeared in a video, it is claimed . The bride?: A girl said she was Rawan and she lives with her father and mother in their Yemen home . Reports on 9 September stated an eight-year-old girl who married a 40-year-old man had died . In a video released by Gulf News, . Mohammed Abdu Abkar Ebrahim Hattan blasted the story as a rumour . fabricated by people 'duped by Satan'. On camera he insisted angrily that only one of his six daughters is married, and it is not Rawan. 'They are all in good health and not suffering from anything and I deny this news.' Standing beside him in pink, the little girl giggles for the camera as she too denies the claims. Asked if she is married, she says: 'No, it is not true.' The interviewer asks: 'What would you like to say to the people who said that you were dead?' 'I would say to them that this is not true,' she retorts. News of the alleged death broke on September 9, went viral and prompted outrage around the world. Human rights groups branded it a . landmark case, and said arrests would help put a stop to the practice of . marrying very young girls to older men in the impoverished region. One blogger, Angry Man, posted that the man was 'an animal who deserved to be punished severely for his crime. 'All those who supported such a crime should also be punished.' Another blogger, Omar, wrote: 'Rawanâ€™s family members are not humans. They do not deserve to have children.' The European Union foreign policy . chief, Catherine Ashton, said last week she was 'appalled' by the case . and pressed the Yemen government to investigate. In the video, the interviewer asks Mr Hattan: 'It is said that you married off your eight-year-old daughter who bled and died?' Angry: A man identified as Rawan's father tells the camera people 'were duped by Satan' to spread rumours . Innocent?: Mr Hattan explains that he has one son and seven daughters. One is married, not Rawan . 'This is untrue and baseless,' he replies. 'It is not true. The people who spread this rumour are no good.' Asked what he has to say to his accusers, Mr Hattan says: 'There are people who like me and there are those who hate me'. Mr Hattan shrugs when asked why anyone would fabricate such a story he replied: 'Allah knows. Misunderstanding may occur between you and the other person. Those people who spread this rumour were duped by Satan to fabricate the story. 'They want to disturb media, officials and me...It is propaganda.' The video shows a young girl in a flowery hijab and pink T-shirt, smiling into the lens. The interviewer asks: 'Do you live with family in this house with your father and mother?' 'Yes, with my father and mother,' she replies. 'What would you like to say to the people who said that you were dead?' 'I would say to them that this is not true.' The girl is said to have died in the tribal area of Hardh in northwestern Yemen, which borders Saudi Arabia. The practice of marrying young girls is widespread in Yemen and has attracted the attention of international rights groups seeking to pressure the government to outlaw child marriages. But the horrifying reports about Rawan prompted at least one government minister to vow that the minimum age for marriage would be raised to 18. Yemen's poverty plays a role in hindering efforts to stamp out the practice of child marriage, as poor families find themselves unable to say no to 'bride-prices' for their daughters that can be worth hundreds of dollars. More than a quarter of Yemen's females marry before age 15, according to a report in 2010 by the Social Affairs Ministry. Tribal custom also plays a role, including the belief that a young bride can be shaped into an obedient wife, bear more children and be kept away from temptation. In September 2010, a 12-year-old Yemeni child-bride died after struggling for three days in labour to give birth, a local human rights organisation said. Yemen once set 15 as the minimum age for marriage, but parliament annulled that law in the 1990s, saying parents should decide when a daughter marries. Growing crisis: A 40-year-old bridegroom and his 11-year-old bride during their wedding in Damarda, Afghanistan. Many countries have no lower age limit for marriage . Following reports of the Rawan case, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Baroness Catherine Ashton, called on the Yemeni government to investigate and make arrests. Days later, Yemen's human rights minister has asked parliament to pass a law setting a minimum age for marriage. The minimum age was 15 years old until the 1990s when the government overturned the law. There are currently 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India. At this rate, the figure is expected to rise to 140 million by 2020. It is a common custom among poorer families who rely on their daughter to help herself and the rest of the family to build their income. In Yemen, more than a quarter of females marry before age 15, according to a report in 2010 by the Social Affairs Ministry. In Africa, 42 per cent; Latin America and the Caribbean, 29 per cent. In India, almost half the population (46 . per cent) of girls are married by the time they reach 18, according to . the National Family Health Survey-3.","Reports had claimed Rawan, 8, died of internal injuries after wedding to 40-year-old man .

"By . Elsa Mcalonan . It may be getting colder, but the continuing trend for fake tanning shows no signs of cooling off. Strictly, X Factor and I’m A Celebrity have done much to boost sales of self tanning products and with Christmas parties about to kick off, more bottles will be flying off the shelves as shoppers prepare for the party season. I used to think I had to spend at least £20 and upwards to get a decent self tanner. The earliest budget self tanners produced unattractive tangerine hues that were less than lovely and don’t even think about the unforgettable whiff of some of the first self-tanning products - seriously stinky. Cheap and cheerful? Elsa McAlonan puts the new Anovia £1 fake tan to the test for Femail . But the quality (and smell, thankfully) of products under £10 is improving all the time - Cocoa Brown (the tan pictured here) is an affordable self tanning range that is proving a winner with self-tanning fans. Despite the lower price tags, some of these budget self tanners are proving every bit as good as the premium ranges. And now there's an even cheaper range to try. Love the Tan (a range of four products that cost £1 each) has just been launched by Anovia, the low-cost skin and body range, which is developed and manufactured in the UK. All products are ph balanced and enriched with active natural ingredients that are kind to skin. But I thought this sounded too good to be true, so decided to try them. Bargain beauty: Anovia's £1 tanning range includes moisturiser, primer and smooth-on instant bronzer . Elsa's favourite: Femail's tester adored the self tan moisturiser and said it didn't streak . LOVE THE TAN EXFOLIATING PRIMER . You should always exfoliate before applying self tanner, so it is well worth using this in your tanning routine. For best results, massage into damp skin and rinse off thoroughly. Pat skin dry before applying tanner. It does the job well, smells pleasant and is not too granular, so gentle on the skin.LOVE THE TAN SELF MOISTURISER . This is enriched with cocoa butter and vitamin E and works in three hours to produce a natural glow. Available in either light/medium or medium/dark. Amazingly it didn’t streak. I tried light/medium, which was dark enough for my skin tones. I think the medium/dark would have been too dark and not natural looking. LOVE THE TAN SMOOTH ON INSTANT BRONZER . I prefer wash off bronzing gels if I just need a bit of colour on my arms or legs. Go easy when you open the tube as it comes out in a huge globby chocolate sauce spurt. For best results exfoliate first definitely use an application mitt or gloves with this – the colour is good and it certainly looks natural. It comes off easily with soap and water, but be warned – it takes a bit of rubbing to remove it. Love the Tan is a collection of self-tanning products available for only £1* each and all available to buy now at Poundland. FASTEST WORKING: Cocoa Brown 1 Hour Instant Tan, £7.99 (Superdrug) This . is great for last-minute fixes as it dries really quickly. The colour . goes on evenly, but make sure the skin is prepared first, as it will . stick to any dry patches. It’s best if washed off after an hour, but . leave it on for up to three hours for a darker shade. LONGEST LASTING:Garnier Ambre Solaire Gloss Bronzer Self-Tanning Gel, £8.99 (Boots) A . light gel that slides on easily and works well if it’s buffed when . applying with a mitt – don’t even try applying this with just your . fingers, as it streaks. Its big advantage is that it lasts well – use . every day for up to three days and the colour will last for a week. EASIEST TO APPLY: St Moriz Instant Self-Tanning Mousse Medium, £4.99 (Boots) This . mousse is really quick and easy to apply as you can see exactly where . you’re putting the colour. This is best applied with gloves so you can . really blend it into skin and rub away any streaks as you’re applying . it. You need to keep skin well moisturised and the colour won’t flake . off, and will fade gradually. BEST COLOUR: Tanatomicals Self Tan Cream, £6.99 (Superdrug) This . is a great range that doesn’t always get the credit it deserves. Although creams can sometimes be difficult to apply as they can easily . streak, you won’t go wrong with this one. Apply with a tanning mitt and . it gives a light colour instantly. Leave overnight and you’ll be pale . golden in the morning – even with fair skins, it won’t leave an orange . hue.","Poundland has launched a range of £1 tans called Anovia .

"By . Sara Malm . Violent attack: Former Big Brother contestant Charlie Drummond, pictured outside court, has been jailed for 21 months at Newcastle Crown Court . A former Big Brother star has been jailed for a violent assault where he left a man’s foot ‘facing the wrong way’. Charlie Drummond, who came fourth in the show in 2009, has been sentenced to 21 months behind bars after a jury found him guilty of causing grievous bodily harm, in the ‘sustained attack’. Mr Drummond, 27, was heading home after a night out in Newcastle when he attached an innocent man in the street because he believed the man was mocking him. The former reality TV personality left victim Jamie Ritchie with a fractured leg and dislocated ankle, which needed three operations and four months in plaster to correct. Sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court, Judge James Goss QC told him: ‘You set upon Mr Ritchie, who did not provoke in any way the reaction that you formulated. ‘You grabbed him, you took him to the middle of the road, took him to the ground, during the course of which he suffered a fractured leg and severely dislocated his ankle. ‘You continued to assault him by, at the very least, punching him while on the ground. ‘This was a sustained assault on a man who had done nothing to deserve it. As a result of the attack, he suffered really serious harm. ‘It caused considerable pain and he required three operations under general anaesthetic to repair the damage that had been done. ‘You have contested your guilt, which is your right, but by reason of doing that you have sought to blame everyone but yourself for what took place.’ Newcastle Crown Court heard former Mr Gay UK runner-up Drummond carried out the violent attack on Jamie and his friends in the early hours of April 14 last year. Mr Ritchie, 32, told the court he and his friends were heading home after a night out in the city when a teenager who was with Drummond's group initially attacked one of Mr Ritchie's friends before the violence turned on him. Mr Drummond, pictured with Noirin Kelly on Big Brother in 2009, was found guilty of a violent assault in Newcastle which took place last April where he left his victim's foot 'facing the wrong way' Despite the group repeatedly telling their attackers they were not looking for trouble violence erupted. It is thought Drummond may have wrongly believed Mr Ritchie and his friends were laughing at him and his friends as they passed in the street. But Mr Ritchie said, he had actually been laughing at himself after accidentally walking into a lamp-post. ‘He (Drummond) punched me with his left fist in the face,’ he told the court. ‘I didn't know what was going on, I tried to stop him. Then I went to the ground. I was on the floor and not able to get up and had excruciating pain in my ankle. ‘I was punched several times. When I was on the floor I was trying to stop him punching me. ‘I was on the floor until the ambulance arrived.’ The court heard witnesses claim Drummond, who has lost his job at Barclays bank and is deep in debt, had pulled Mr Ritchie by the leg while he was on the ground injured during the attack. Prosecutors accept it was a male, who cannot be named, who was with Drummond that night who started the violence with Mr Ritchie's group by headbutting one of them in the face. Attack: Mr Drummond, a former finalist in Mr Gay UK, attacked his victim after allegedly believing him and his friends were laughing at his group during a night out in Newcastle . Drummond, who lives in Croydon, London, but originally comes from Cleadon, South Tyneside, denied any blame for what happened. Instead the housemate, who has been the victim of violence in the past, told jurors it was he who came under attack from Mr Ritchie's group. He said: ‘I was not there to cause anyone injury, I was protecting myself and that is the truth. ‘I was terrified for my life. I didn't know what was going to happen, that is honestly how I felt. ‘I was quite emotional if I'm honest. I just wanted it to be over.’ Drummond told the court he had drank four pints that night while out celebrating his sister's birthday but was not drunk. Shaun Routledge, defending, said Drummond was working in a Barclays bank in London selling insurance, mortgages and loans until he told them about the court case and it was decided it would be ‘best he left’. Mr Routledge said Drummond had hoped to earn £25,000 per year through his new employment with a recruitment agency in the capital. He added: ‘For the most part, this young man has demonstrated that he is not a person to cause trouble. ‘He is not the type of young man who goes looking for trouble.’","Big Brother contestant Charlie Drummond jailed for 21 months .

An average car tyre will travel around 20,000 miles over its lifetime, but when they have reached the end of their life in Kuwait... they are destined for the tyre graveyard.

The tyre graveyard: An average car tyre will travel around 20,000 miles over its lifetime, but when they have reached the end of their life in Kuwait... they are destined for the tyre graveyard . A sea of rubber: In Kuwait City's Sulaibiya area every year gigantic holes are dug out out in the sandy earth and filled with old tyres - there are now over seven million in the ground . Visible: An aerial image shows the vast amount of used tyres that are put in the ground - the patches are even visible from space . It is thought the tyres are from both Kuwait and other countries which have paid for them to be taken away - four companies are in charge of the disposal and are thought to make a substantial amount from the disposal fees. The European landfill directive means . that this type of 'waste disposal would be illegal in Europe -  since 2006 EU rules have banned the disposal of tyres in landfill sites, leaving about 480,000 tonnes of recyclable shredded rubber each year . In Britain all car . and truck tyres must be recovered, recycled and reused. Currently, more than 80 per cent of . the 55 million used tyres generated in Britain are processed via the . Responsible Recycler Scheme. The scheme ensures full traceability . and accountability of waste tyres throughout the disposal chain, from . collection through to their final reuse in an environmentally friendly . or acceptable method. Materials from properly recycled tyres are used for a variety of uses including a children’s playground, running tracks, artificial sports pitches, fuel for cement kilns, carpet underlay, equestrian arenas and flooring. Bales of tyres can be used in the . construction of modern engineered landfill sites and flood defences. If . waste tyres are in good condition, they can be re-moulded and put back . on the road as ‘re-treads’. Banned: The European landfill directive means that this type of 'waste disposal' would be illegal in Europe . Illegal:  Since 2006 it has been illegal in Britain to send waste tyres to landfill and all car and truck tyres must be recovered, recycled and reused . In 2010, just over 30 per cent of . waste tyres were turned into crumb, 18 per cent were used in energy . recovery, nearly 20 per cent were re-used (in the UK or abroad), 16 per . cent were specifically used in landfill engineering and 11 per cent were . re-treaded, according to the Environment Agency. In . some circumstances tyres are shipped out to countries such as India, . Pakistan and Malaysia, but there are strict laws about their . exportation. The Environment Agency says 'While . there is a legitimate export market for quality recyclable material, . the illegal export of waste undermines law-abiding disposal and tyre . recovery businesses here in the UK and risks harming people and the . environment in the country the waste is exported to.' Last month it emerged that recycled car tyres could . soon be used to surface roads across the country after a pioneering . trial found they made roads quieter. One of the busiest roads in Scotland was resurfaced last year with the asphalt, containing shredded rubber from old tyres. Tests were performed on grip and skid . resistance, with engineers reporting that the rubber road, on a stretch . of dual carriageway between Perth and Dundee, resulted in a quieter . drive. Experts claim the road requires less . maintenance and still allows for drainage, while tyre recyclers claim . the technique will also save money because the new material is thinner . than standard roads. Dramatic: Last year a fire broke out in a Kuwait tyre dump which was so big that it could be seen from space . Tower of tyres: In some circumstances tyres are shipped out to countries such as India, Pakistan and Malaysia from Britain, but there are strict laws about their exportation . Danger: There would be serious consequences if this field of tyres caught alight - tyre fires are difficult to extinguish- they produce a lot of smoke, which often carries toxic chemicals from the breakdown of rubber compounds while burning . Rubber roads were first built in the 1960s in the US, where today there are 20,000 miles of road made of recycled tyres. Rubber roads are also popular in China, Brazil, Spain and Germany. The technique has been found to cut traffic noise by about 25 per cent. The asphalt is made by breaking down used tyres into rubber ‘crumbs’ which are added to bitumen and crushed stone, which are typically used to make asphalt. Last year a fire broke out in a Kuwait tyre dump which was so big that it could be seen from space. The fire broke out on April 17 at a tire dump near Al Jahrah. It . is believed that around five million tires fuelled the fire which . specialists struggled to control.

A number of MPs described the fire as . an 'environmental catastrophe' and vowed to demand a debate on the . issue in a special parliamentary session  Some said they will demand an . official probe.

"By . Bianca London . An illustrated book from 1893 with one man's prediction of what fashions of the decades to come would look like has been unearthed. The Future Dictates of Fashion by W. Cade Gall was published in the January 1893 edition of The Strand magazine and contains hilarious illustrations of the 'future of fashion'. The article, which was found in a library, predicts one hundred years' worth of style. 1900-1912: The Future Dictates of Fashion by W. Cade Gall was published in the January 1893 edition of The Strand magazine and contains illustrations of what he predicts will be the future of fashion . It begins in 1900 with a rather wizardly array of garments, including plenty of walking sticks, oversized hats and voluminous skirts. The men of the 1920s sport billowing shorts and extravagant hats, while his vision for the 1930s focuses on oversized coats with ribbon embellishment. 1920s: Billowing culottes - tipped to be a big trend this season - were the order of the day in his vision of the 20s . The 1930s (left) were a lot more stylish than Gall predicted - but he was right in thinking hats would play a big part in the 1920s (right) 1930s: All attention is on headwear in the 1930s and it seems that the bigger, the better . 1940s: Things are looking more stylish by the 40s...could those be leather trousers? 1940s: While Gall predicted flowing skirts and loose-fitted outerwear (left), the reality was a much more stylish affair (right) The 1940s, as imagined by Gall, focus on intricate headwear and what look like leather trousers for men - which actually took the fashion scene by storm last season. The 1950s and 1960s show an appreciation of layering and the 'skirt over trousers' look that was prominent in the 90s makes an appearance. Fashion of the 1970s and 1980s is a much more regal affair, with a big emphasis on tailoring. The styles of 1993 show a lady clad in an outfit consisting of a Breton striped T-shirt - a stylish wardrobe staple for decades now - and flowing ankle-length skirt. 1950s: The 1950s and 1960s show an appreciation of layering and the 'skirt over trousers' look and hats are still hot on the style agenda . 1950s: The Fifties prediction was spot-on in terms of ruffled layers but there were no skirts over trousers in evidence, at least not in the case of actress Linda Christian in 1950 (right) The Public Domain Review, which published the illustrations, says: 'If indeed this was a genuine attempt by the author Gall to imagine what the future of fashion might look like, it’s fascinating to see how far off the mark he was, proving yet again how difficult it is to predict future aesthetics. 'It is also fascinating to see how Gall envisaged the progression of fashions across the decades - considering that, from our perspective now, his vision of 1970 doesn’t much look much different to 1920 - and to see which aspects of his present he wasn’t even able to consider losing to the march of time (e.g. the long length of women’s skirts and the seemingly ubiquitous frill). 'As is often the case when we come into contact with historic attempts to predict a future which for us is now past, it is like glimpsing into another possible world, a parallel universe that could have been.' 1970s: While there isn't a stark contrast between the fashion of the 20s and 70s, tailoring is more prominent in the latter decade . 1970s: While he may have got the flared trousers spot on, Gall didn't predict the flower power fashion of the 70s (right) Eighties fashion could be outrageous, but wasn't quite as out there as Gall predicted (left), Princess Diana shows us the glitzy side of real 1980s style (right) 1993: A lady clad in an unflattering outfit consisting of a Breton T-shirt and flowing ankle-length skirt was the forecast for 1993 - and it isn't too dissimilar from Gianfranco Ferre SS 1993 fashion collection in Milan (right)","The Future Dictates of Fashion was published January 1893 .

"By . Sara Malm . When Lulu Melotte lost her business in the recession, she made the life-altering choice of taking her children out of school and spent all her savings on a family trip around the world. Mother-of-two Lulu, 40, was living in Barcelona with husband Nacho, 38, when the economic downturn forced her to give up her job running an organic shop. Her husband was made redundant around the same time, so the couple decided to leave Spain behind and explore the world with their children  Frida, three, and seven-year-old Leon. Family adventure: Lulu and Nacho Melotte gave up their lives in Barcelona, Spain and took her children Frida, three, and Leon, seven on trip around Asia . Lulu, from Putney, south-west London, has spent every penny she owns on her family's six-month tour of Asia, but says she does not regret emptying her purse on the trip. The Melottes visited Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Singapore and Indonesia at a cost of £9,000, budgeting for a £1,000-a-month living expenses after spending £3,000 on flights. Lulu, who moved to Spain after a holiday romance with Nacho, said: ‘Everyone was losing their jobs left, right and centre, so we thought the best thing to do was leave the country. ‘We had always discussed travelling with our children as we thought it would be a wonderful thing to do as a family and they were the ideal ages. ‘Nacho had some redundancy money, and we thought rather than pay it into a bank which could collapse overnight, we'd go on an adventure. So that's what we did.' Globetrotters: The Melottes, pictured in Bali, Indonesia, withdrew all their savings to take their children on a 'school of life' journey around the world . Invaluable: Frida, three, pictured in Saturn, Thailand, has seen a lot of the world at a very early age, something her mother says is worth much more than the £9,000 it cost the family . Learning from life: Lulu believes Frida and Leon, pictured riding an elephant for the first time in Pai,Thailand, have learned invaluable lessons that they could never have been taught in a school . Lulu has no qualms over taking her children out of education in order for them to see the world, saying Frida and Leon have been taught in the 'school of life’. ‘We did a lot of sightseeing and the children saw their first elephants and monkeys on our travels and both learnt to snorkel. ‘We saw a lot of poverty too. My little girl gave her favourite bright pink shoes to a baby who lived on the street and we gave the family toys and clothes too. ‘They spent a lot of time playing with street kids and made a lot of friends along the way but it's hard for them to build friendships because we were always moving on. ‘The kids didn't like the creepy crawlies much and sometimes we had to bang on the floor to rid them of snakes.’ Carpe diem: Adventurous Lulu, snapped enjoying Bali, says she has no regrets removing her children from school and spending all the family's money on the trip . The family are now living in Putney with Lulu's parents, repaying credit card debts and building a new life, but despite this, Lulu believes she made the right choice. She said: ‘Three of friends all my age with children have died and that shows life is too short. ‘I . have spent six quality months with my babies and the most important . thing in life is your health and happiness - it's not about materialism . and money.’ Lulu, who is working part-time in a cafe, added: ‘The last six months have been a whizz. ‘We are desperately trying to keep the adventure going for the children but they will probably not fully appreciate what they have done until they are older and look back.'","Lulu Melotte took her children out of school and on a trip around the world .

"By . Kirsty Walker . Updated: . 03:39 EST, 29 February 2012 . Payout: Millionaire Chris Huhne will pocket £17,000 - the equivalent of three months of his ministerial salary despite being forced to resign because he faces prosecution . Chris Huhne will pocket a taxpayer-funded payoff worth more than £17,000 today – despite being the first Cabinet minister in history to be forced from office by a criminal prosecution. The millionaire MP, who recently bought his eighth property, is being handed the tax-free sum after stepping down to fight charges of perverting the course of justice. Mr Huhne resigned as Energy Secretary on February 3 after he was charged over allegations that he used his ex-wife Vicky Pryce’s name to escape speeding penalty points. By law, Mr Huhne is allowed three months of his £68,827 ministerial salary, worth £17,207. This is on top of his £65,738 salary as Liberal Democrat MP for Eastleigh in Hampshire. The 57-year-old MP, who has fiercely protested his innocence, has been under pressure from opponents to forfeit the ministerial severance payment. However last night the Cabinet Office confirmed that Mr Huhne will receive it today. His decision to accept the money has triggered accusations of hypocrisy as senior Liberal Democrats have condemned ex-ministers for taking payoffs. In 2010, Mr Huhne shared a platform with Conservative Party chairman Baroness Warsi when she called for ex-ministers to forfeit the controversial taxpayer-funded payoffs. She said: ‘At a time when people across the country are being asked to tighten their belts to deal with Labour’s economic mess, it is unacceptable that the very people responsible walk away with up to £20,000 each. ‘Forfeiting this pay would be the first step towards accepting their responsibility.’ Mr Huhne’s Lib Dem colleague, pensions minister Steve Webb, said in 2009: ‘People will be shocked to learn that former ministers get these payoffs even when they have been sacked or left of their own free will. While thousands are losing their jobs, failed ministers get a huge payout on top of their salary as MPs. This can’t go on.’ Mr Huhne’s fellow Lib Dem David Laws refused to take the payment, authorised under the 1991 Ministerial and Other Pensions and Salaries Act, when he stepped down from the Cabinet over his expenses days after the General Election in May 2010. One of Britain’s richest MPs, Mr Huhne has an extensive property portfolio. It included a £250,000 property in his Hampshire constituency, two flats in Highbury, north London, a house and a flat in Oxford, and a share in a house in Languedoc, Southern France. He has ceded to his ex-wife the £2.5million townhouse in Clapham, south London, which they used to share. His eighth property is a £1.25million two-bedroom apartment in London’s fashionable Clerkenwell. At one point, he was receiving an estimated income of £80,000 a year from rented properties. A former financial journalist, Mr Huhne built his fortune as a City economist after founding his own ratings company Sovereign Ratings IBCA. Humbling: Chris Huhne appears before magistrates after becoming the first Cabinet minister in history to be forced from office by a prosecution. He fiercely denies any wrong-doing and has vowed to fight the allegations . He sold the company to Fitch, where he became vice Chairman. He once claimed back £119 on Commons expenses for a mahogany Corby trouser press, which he later repaid. The taxpayer was also asked to foot the £85 bill for the ‘mounting, framing and inscription of a photograph of Chris Huhne’ to hang in the entrance of his constituency’s civic centre. Earlier this month Mr Huhne and his former wife appeared alongside each other in a court dock accused of perverting the course of justice. Co-accused: Vicky Pryce also faces trial over claims she accepted penalty points on behalf of her ex-husband . The case was sent to Southwark Crown Court for trial. Both were remanded on unconditional bail and ordered to attend the court on March 2. The allegations, which stretch back to 2003, surfaced after the couple separated in 2010 when the Energy Secretary announced he was leaving his wife of 27 years for his aide Carina Trimingham. His car was allegedly caught by a speed camera on the motorway between Stansted Airport in Essex and London in March 2003. Mr Huhne, who has three children and two stepchildren with his former wife, has insisted he is ‘innocent’ of the charges. He said he was resigning to ‘avoid any distraction’ to his official duties. The pair face the charge of perverting the course of justice – an offence for which, along with perjury, former Tory Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken was jailed for 18 months. A jail sentence of more than 12 months would mean Mr Huhne’s Parliamentary career coming to an end, as well as his Cabinet one. MPs who are imprisoned for more than a year automatically lose their seats. It is not known whether Mr Huhne plans to keep the money. He was unavailable for comment last night. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that following his resignation from the Cabinet, Chris Huhne will receive a severance payment of three months of his ministerial salary.’ Speaking about Mr Huhne’s appearance alongside Baroness Warsi, Labour MP Chris Evans said earlier this month: ‘If he didn’t agree with her, he should have said so. He should now forfeit the £17,207 he is entitled to. ‘And if the Tories don’t make it clear that they believe Chris Huhne should give up this payment, it will be clear that they think there’s one rule for them and their Liberal Democrat friends and another for everyone else.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Chris Huhne accused of hypocrisy as senior Lib Dems condemned severance pay .

A snack foods company plans to up the ante on their advertising techniques similar to the Hollywood movie Minority Report and 'watch' every customer who shops for their delicious treats. Mondelez International, whose portfolio includes the likes of Chips Ahoy, Nabisco, Oreo, Trident, Toblerone, Halls, Ritz and other high-profile snacks, says it plans to debut a grocery shelf in 2015, which comes equipped with sensors to determine the age and sex of passing customers.

Snack foods powerhouse: Mondelez International plans to target advertisements at its customers through shelving sensors that determine the age and sex of shoppers . It will be able to scan basic facial features like bone structure to build a profile of a potential snacker, Mondelez chief information officer Mark Dajani told the Wall Street Journal. Pictures of people’s faces will not be stored however the scanner will aggregate demographic data from the thousands of people who shop in these stores. The information will help the company build a more accurate understanding of what their consumers like to buy and thereby help funnel more of the desired products to the right shoppers.

It is also hoped the new technology will help to convince people who are undecided about what to buy to make an impulse buy by offering well-timed in-store commercials or coupons when the embedded weight sensor learns they have picked up an item, according to The Washington Post. It is something quite similar to the Hollywood film Minority Report, where Tom Cruise is bombarded from all sides with advertising that is based on his state of mind.

'Their daughter, Alba, is the most gorgeous baby. Emma says she's a really good girl too - she even sleeps well. 'Gareth . is not a show-off, even now that he is doing so well.

'She has fiery Italian roots - I'm sure if the opportunity to move to Italy ever came up Emma wouldn't say no.' Emma . is the second eldest of five children. She has one older sister, . Charlotte, 24, a younger sister, Katie, 20, and twin brothers Robert and . John, 19. She first started dating Gareth when they were pupils together at Whitchurch High School in Cardiff when they were teenagers.

New era: Bale poses for the camera alongside Perez holding his new number 11 shirt . It is this deep connection to family life that had critics speculating Bale would not leave north London club Tottenham Hotspur and its close proximity to the M4 for his bi-weekly trips over the Severn Bridge. But now that the deal is finalised - while other footballing stars use their down time to jet set and mingle with A-listers around the world - Emma and Gareth will no doubt use their holidays to return to the open arms of home. In 2011 Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp said: 'I gave Gareth four days off last week because I thought he needed a break, and I told him to go abroad. 'But he went to Cardiff to his mum's. That’s him all over.' This commitment to their roots has been a massive factor in maintaining their relationship. After almost ten years together it is rumoured that the pair are engaged, but Bale notoriously keeps his private life a closely guarded secret. The closest he's ever come to revealing a snippet was in 2011 when he told a reporter: 'I like looking after my family.' Humble beginnings: Gareth Bale's parents modest 3 bedroom semi detached house (left) in Cardiff, where the superstar in the making grew up . Bale finally signed the £83.5million contract that made him the most expensive footballer ever in front of a stadium packed to the rafters with adoring Real Madrid fans. In broken Spanish, the £85.3million player told a near 85,000 capacity stadium: 'It's a dream to be here and to play for Real Madrid. I appreciate this welcome.' Bale flew to Madrid this morning for a medical. At about 12.30pm the softly spoken Welshman made his first public appearance as a Real Madrid player, a dream he had harboured since he was a boy. Earlier today, the 24-year-old said: 'I know many players talk of their desire to join the club of their boyhood dreams, but I can honestly say, this is my dream come true.'","Polite family girl from Cardiff happy with just a glass of wine on the sofa .

"By . Sean Poulter . The makers of Cow and Gate baby milk claimed their product provides calcium for 'strong bones' and iron for 'brain development' A TV advert for Cow & Gate baby milk has been banned for exaggerating the product’s health benefits. The commercial said that the powdered formula provides calcium for ‘strong bones’ and iron for ‘brain development’. But pro-breast feeding campaigners said it suggested an added advantage, when nutrients added to the product only play a part in the ‘normal’ development of the bones and brain. A ruling published by the Advertising Standards Authority today says  manufacturer Danone misrepresented the health effects. The . group Baby Milk Action, which brought the complaint, insists breast . milk followed by a mixed diet is better for developing babies and said . Danone is ‘ripping parents off’. Its . campaigns chief, Mike Brady, said: ‘Advertisements such as Danone’s . suggest that follow-on milks provide health benefits, but they are . unnecessary products and Danone is simply ripping parents off, using . false claims to make them think they need these milks. ‘Yes, . calcium is needed for normal growth and bone development in children . and iron contributes to normal cognitive development, but these are . provided by a normal diet and Danone’s products offer nothing special . other than a way for the company to fill its pockets. ‘The cost of these multi-million pound advertising campaigns goes onto the price of the milks making them even more expensive.’ He . complained that the ASA system for policing commercials does not work . in the consumer interest. The commercial has already appeared many times . and there is no sanction against Danone, other than the publicity . generated by the ASA decision. Mr . Brady said: ‘We have won repeated cases proving that claims made for . baby formula do not stand up to scrutiny, but the firms continue using . them regardless because the ASA is a toothless body requiring no . corrections and levying no fines. ‘Many . of these practices also break the law in our view, but Trading .

The group Baby Milk Action, which brought the complaint, insists breast milk followed by a mixed diet is better for developing babies . Danone said it had simply re-phrased a number of health claims that have been approved for use by the European Food Safety Authority(EFSA). EFSA has approved the phrase - ‘calcium is needed for normal growth and development of bone in children’. Danone said its phrase - ‘provides calcium for strong bones’ - means the same thing. Similarly, EFSA has approved the sentence -  ‘Iron contributes to normal cognitive development of children’. Danone argued its phrase - ‘iron for brain development’ - includes better, more consumer friendly, language. However, the ASA rejected the firm’s explanation and said the wording in the commercial implied a greater health effect than is allowed. Consequently, it said it should not be shown again in its current format.","Ad for Cow & Gate baby milk criticised by pro-breast feeding campaigners .

"By . Jill Reilly . Emma Stanfield, 40, a hospital radio DJ, walked free from court today . A female radio DJ who had sex with a 15-year-old girl after plying her with vodka has walked free from court because she did not know the teenager's real age. Emma Stanfield, 40, said she thought the girl was 16 and only found out her true age the morning after the night they spent together at her Oxford apartment. The prosecution claimed that Ms Stanfield knew the girl was underage and then 'recklessly' pursued her, leaving her 29 missed calls and more than 100 Facebook messages in the days that followed. However, the jury instead believed the emotional DJ’s account and she was acquitted of three counts of sexual activity with a child and one of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Ms Stanfield met the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, on the afternoon of May 28 last year. The DJ had stayed over at a friend’s house following a night out drinking in Oxford on May 27. Her friend had left to go to work the following morning, leaving Ms Stanfield alone in the house with her friend’s 16-year-old daughter. The jury heard Ms Stanfield and the young girl began drinking vodka and shared a kiss. That girl then said she was not attracted to women but said her bisexual best friend was coming over soon. Soon after she arrived, Ms Stanfield gave the girl vodka and straddled her on the sofa with her top off, kissing her. The DJ claimed she thought the bisexual girl was also aged 16 years, but prosecutors said both girls had made her aware that she was only 15 at the time. Ms Stanfield said the girl was 'very keen' after they had kissed and fondled on the sofa. She then left to present her 4-7pm radio show on community radio station OX105FM. She returned to the house after 7pm and the girl asked to go back to her flat in Chapel Street, Oxford, where they had sex that night. Ms Stanfield told the court they had spoken about the girl’s age the next morning. Ms Stanfield said in her evidence: 'We got up - it was quite early - and she said ‘there’s something I need to tell you.’ 'She told me her real age. She told me she had lied and she was really 15.' The DJ told the jury she felt 'awful' on hearing the revelation, adding: 'She then said, ""let’s look it up, let’s see what you would get if the police found out.""' Emma Stanfield told Oxford Crown Court she thought the girl was 16 and only found out her true age the morning after the night they spent together at her Oxford apartment . Speaking after the verdicts, Ms Stanfield said the case was a 'very stressful' experience for her and she was looking forward to putting it behind her . Afterwards, Ms Stanfield said there was a 'bit of an atmosphere' and the girl left her home. In the days that followed, Ms Stanfield sent the girl more than 100 Facebook messages, including asking her if she enjoyed oral sex. 'I really like you, I want you to know that and I would like you to be my girlfriend,' she wrote. The jury at Oxford Crown Court took just over 90 minutes to return their verdicts after the three-day trial. As the verdicts were read out, Ms Stanfield gave a huge sigh of relief and said 'thank you' to the jury. She then rushed from the dock smiling and hugged a man who was in court supporting her. Speaking . after the verdicts, Ms Stanfield said the case was a 'very stressful' experience for her and she was looking forward to putting it behind her. 'I have had every confidence throughout the case that I would get the verdict that we have just had,' she said. 'It’s not a situation that I would want to repeat being in. I was in a very bad place last year to where I am now. 'It’s . not very nice to have your private life displayed publicly before a . huge amount of people, not just within the courtroom but within the . Press.

Entertainers: Mattie (left) playing with some balloons, and her brother Tito (right) dressed as a cowboy . Julie said: 'I would never recommend people dress their monkeys in costumes, but they are all individually made to their sizes from safe materials and are comfortable. 'They don't harm the animals, quite often they need nappies when being kept in domestic environments so it's for practical reasons, they also help to keep them warm in the winter. 'But a lot of owners want to treat their pets and make them look glamorous so whatever they request I can make for them.'","Designer Julie Staup has sold thousands of outfits worldwide .

David Cameron faces fresh humiliation at the hands of Nicolas Sarkozy after the French president stole a march on the British in preparations for the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. The Prime Minister was last night accused of ‘dragging his feet’ over the important commemorations in 2014 and letting the French race ahead with spectacular anniversary plans. The Mail on Sunday can reveal they will include a £25 million state-of-the-art Museum Of The Great War to be announced by Mr Sarkozy on Remembrance Day next month. Heroes: Wounded British soldiers make their way back from the front line . The French president, who last week told Mr Cameron to ‘shut up’ and stop interfering in the eurozone crisis talks, is also pledging millions for other events across France. Even Belgium is years ahead, with firm proposals including a memorial garden in London made from soil from the battlefields of Flanders. Last week, a slanging match broke out at Westminster over the lack of planning, with MPs saying neither the Department for Culture nor the Ministry of Defence was taking the lead. First World War experts urged Mr Cameron to get a grip on commemorating the centenary of a conflict that cost the lives of 750,000 Britons. 'Dragging his feet': David Cameron (left) is facing fresh humiliation at the hands of Nicolas Sarkozy (right) Respected war historian Professor Hew . Strachan, a trustee of the Imperial War Museum and the man who was asked . by the Coalition to draw up proposals for the Government’s military . covenant, said: ‘Regrettably, other countries involved in the Great War . are more advanced in their preparations for what will be a momentous . occasion. 'It is vital we catch up to ensure Britain’s contribution to . the historic conflict is properly reflected.’ Last night, Whitehall sources said the . deadlock had been broken, with news that No 10 had chosen Tory MP and . ex-Royal Navy surgeon Andrew Murrison to be the PM’s representative for . the centenary. The 100th anniversary of the 1914-18 . conflict is expected to be a huge event across Europe, but there has . been mounting concern at the failure of Britain to take the lead. Sources said one problem was that the MoD preferred to mark the . centenary of the end of the war, rather than its start. Labour peer Lord Faulkner, chairman of . the all-party War Heritage Group, wrote to Mr Cameron last July to warn . it was not just France that was outstripping Britain. Australia had already set up a . centenary commission, while in the US, a Bill was passing through . Congress to create a national centenary committee, Lord Faulkner said. In his reply, Mr Cameron confirmed  there were as yet no agreed detailed . plans ‘for this important anniversary’. He added: ‘The Government is focused . on plans to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen next year . as well as host the Olympic Games.’ The Mail on Sunday has established just how far ahead France was. MoD sources in Paris revealed the centrepiece of the French commemorations would be a new museum at Meaux. The location, near the site of two great battles of the Marne, raises fears the French will downplay the role of British ‘Tommies’. An MoD source said Mr Sarkozy, who is up for re-election next year, would make the most of the commemoration plans. ‘He wants to confirm himself as the world leader who sees remembrance of the Great War as one of the century’s most important events,’ said the source. The Imperial War Museum said it was marking the centenary with ‘a vibrant programme’ including the opening of permanent First World War galleries. No 10 said announcements about the anniversary ‘will be made shortly’.","Cameron accused of letting the French race ahead with spectacular anniversary plans .

"By . Anna Edwards . At under eight feet wide, most people would automatically pity the owners of this narrow house. But far from being cramped, this home gives a new meaning to the phrase 'good things come in small packages', as behind its thin door is a sprawling property that actually spreads to 22ft wide. Tom and Sarah Tidbury have really made the most of their space after they purchased the period property in 2009. The Tardis surprises people with its extensive space behind its narrow front door . Tom and Sarah Tidbury's 'skinny house' in Clapham, which has a surprising amount of light and space . The narrow door belies the spacious interior inside the south west London property . Tom and Sarah Tidbury decided to make the most of their space - and even have a garden as part of their home . Nicknamed 'the Wedge' as it starts off thin before growing wide at the rear, the couple have extended the 721 square feet of space and being granted the right for a home extension. And with a little creative thinking, the pair have transformed the 7ft 7ins wide place in Clapham, south west London, the Evening Standard reported. Despite appearances the home, which the Tidburys call 'the Tardis' because people cannot believe 'how big it is once you get inside', accommodates four bedrooms, a long, thin garden,and a generously spaced kitchen. To appease planners, who would only grant the property a three floor extension if the roof couldn't been seen from the street, as it is in a conservation area, a 'ski-slope roof' was created, which slopes down to wards the back and has skylights to allow in. By using a sloping roof, more bedrooms could be built within the property, adding to its value . As the property extends and widens at the rear, creative uses of space make this tiny home feel a lot bigger . Clever space solutions mean that the room has ample space for the family's belongings - and amazes people with its roomy interior . There's certainly no slim pickings of . where to relax in the house, as the roof meant they could maximise . space by using slanted ceilings for bedrooms and a dining area built . over the former patio, reached by walking through the kitchen, living . room and the lobby. Clever . use of space includes wall to ceiling shelves for books and photographs, . while huge glass doors give the place a feeling of airiness, the . Evening Standard reported. A shower room and a dining area that opens on to the garden has meant that the value of the house has nearly double. It was purchased for £430,000, but is now estimated to be worth between £750,000 and £800,000. And their new spacious home with its increased value will undoubtedly be the envy of many a young would-be home-owner, who along with millions is struggling to get on to the property ladder. The couple's property - nicknamed 'the wedge' - has now almost doubled in value since they extended it . Don't judge a book by its cover: The cramped-looking house is actually home to four bedrooms, a shower room, a dining room and a charming garden . Around one in three homeowners in England are pensioners as crippling house prices freeze younger generations off the property ladder, official figures revealed last week. In a sign of the property crisis facing young people, the Government’s English Housing Survey revealed homeownership has dropped to its lowest level since the 1980s. At its peak in 2003, 71 per cent of householders were ‘owner occupiers’. Of the 14.4million homeowners in England, the largest number - by a considerable margin - are people aged 65 and over, equal to a record 30 per cent of the total. There are 4.3million homeowners in this age group, which is more than a million higher than the total number for any other age group. By comparison, there are just 2.6million ‘owner occupiers’ in the 35 to 44 age group, the age at which parents are raising a young family, with many desperate to do so in their own home.And the number between the age of 25 and 34, also with young families but likely to have had to pay an even higher price for their home, is nearly half this number at just 1.4million.","Home is 7ft 7ins wide, but inside it spreads to 22ft wide .

"By . Chris Parsons . Updated: . 03:50 EST, 31 October 2011 . A rusting wreck found 180ft underwater in a Papua New Guinea harbour is thought to be that of a Second World War Japanese submarine, experts revealed today. The 66ft-long 'man-made object' found by experts near Simpson Harbour in Rabaul, Papua New Guinea is thought to be a submarine from a major Japanese military base on the northeast coast of the South Pacific country. The wreck was partially buried in sand when discovered, but Australian navy historians were able to conclude that it was Japanese after studying underwater images. Find: The wreckage of the 66ft-long submarine was found 180ft underwater in Papua New Guinea . An underwater image shows the stern section of the uncharted submarine wreck, which was found near a former Japanese wartime military base . Simpson Harbour in Rabaul was Japan's major base in the Southwest Pacific for most of World War Two, and it is thought both the Japanese and the U.S. had accounted for all subs in that area. Most of the wrecks in the harbour came from the country, and previous known submarine wrecks were Japanese, according to Gary Oakley, a Australian War Memorial curator and a former submariner. He said: 'My best guess would be it's a Japanese midget submarine. It doesn't look big enough to be an ocean-going ... submarine.' One and two-man Japanese midget submarines were transported by ship or larger submarines and used covertly to infiltrate enemy targets including Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and Sydney Harbor. Such a submarine could have been destroyed by an American air raid or naval bombardment or even scuttled by the Japanese toward the end of the war. New Zealand Navy Lt. Commander Matthew Ray said underwater remote-controlled vehicles with cameras will be used to try to identify the wreck. Oakley said it could be the first Australian submarine lost in World War I, although that submarine, AE1, was thought to have sunk in another harbor 12 miles (20 kilometers) away. AE1 became the first Australian naval loss of the war when it sank on Sept. 15, 1914, with the loss of 35 lives. Rabaul was then the capital of the German New Guineau colony, which was quickly lost to the British. Simpson Harbour, in Rabaul, Papua New Guinea, was one of Japan's major military bases for most of World War Two . It is thought that around 65 Japanese submarines were sunk in Simpson Harbour by Allied forces in the Second World War .",65 Japanese submarines were sunk by Allied forces in Papua New Guinea harbour during WW2 .

The great leader certainly left his mark on this vehicle, which was specially modified with a heated footwell, an extra-wide passenger seat and a wooden box believed to be for his bricklaying tools. Now the 1954 Series 1 Land Rover which was custom built for Sir Winston Churchill's 80th birthday has sold at auction in Sutton, Cambridgeshire, for £129,000 - more than twice its estimate. The model - which was first registered as UKE 80 in the name of the ‘Rt Hon Sir Winston Spencer Churchill KG. OM. CH. MP. Chartwell, Westerham, Kent’ - has less than 13,000 miles on the clock. Present: The 1954 Series 1 Land Rover was custom built for Sir Winston Churchill's 80th birthday . Working fine: The Land Rover is in good condition today and has less than 13,000 miles on the clock . It was modified so the former British . prime minister could be chauffeur-driven around his sprawling 300-acre . Chartwell estate, and was sold with the original logbook . registering it to him. The vehicle, which had been expected . to fetch only £60,000 at the Cheffins auction, was sold for just £160 by . Churchill’s relatives more than five years after his death in 1965 aged 90. It had been presented to Churchill as . an 80th birthday present in 1954 by Rover, and was registered ‘UKE 80’ just three days later, with the 'UKE' thought to refer to the 'United . Kingdom Empire'. The manufacturers also added a padded . fold-down arm rest in place of the eight-inch wide middle seat, and a . leather-clad grab handle was fitted to the bulkhead. Provenance: The logbook shows the name and address of Sir Winston Churchill in Chartwell, Kent . Inside: The Land Rover was fitted with an extra-wide passenger seat to accommodate the prime minister . Churchill retired from politics in . 1955 and it was later passed onto his son-in-law, the politician Christopher Soames, before it was sold off in a farm sale in . the early 1970s for £160. The vehicle was bought by a Norman . Mills, who asked his friend Frank Quay to help transport it. But when Mr . Quay found Churchill’s name in the logbook, he immediately bought it . for double the price. However it was used to tow the . Quay family’s horse box before they put it away for storage - aware of . its fascinating history - and it had been kept in a shed in Kent since . 1977. Mr Quay believed Churchill used the . wooden box, fitted into the pick-up bed, for storing a trowel . and mortar so he could indulge in his hobby for bricklaying whenever it . suited him.

"By . Damien Gayle . The world has never before seen the moment a polar bear cub opens its eyes for the first time and sees its mother.. until now. A video taken at Hellabrun Zoo in Munich, Germany, shows polar bear Giovanna tenderly cradling her two snow-white cubs in her paws, breathing on them gently to keep them warm. As Giovanna's breath slowly wakes the month-old infants they open their eyes for what keepers believe is the first time, gazing up at her. One of the cubs even stretches out his tiny paw to pat Giovanna on the nose. Mummy, wake up: A tiny polar bear cub reaches . out to pat its mother on the nose in this unique footage taken at . Hellabrun Zoo in Munich which shows the infants opening their eyes for . the very first time yesterday . Magical: This still from Hellabrun Zoo's footage clearly shows one of the cubs opening its eyes for the first time . The video comes after another video first at Hellabrun Zoo in December, when keepers successfully filmed Giovanna giving birth to her two babies. They were the only polar bear cubs to be born in captivity in Europe last year and, incredibly, their mother positioned herself in the direct view of CCTV cameras set up to record the moment. Now the baby cubs' first tentative blink has been recorded on day 33 of their lives, and the footage released by Hellabrun's zoologists. In the heartwarming video, the twins are seen sleeping in their mother's protective embrace when one begins to stir and stretch its forelegs. The movements wakes its sibling, who bursts from beneath their sleeping mother's clasp, the commotion in turn waking Giovanna, who delicately nuzzles and sniffs the nearest cub. It is then that the nearest cub reaches out and brushes its mother on the nose, before both open their eyes just a crack to take their first look at the world around them. Cute: A still from an earlier video shows the infant polar bears slumbering in their mother's embrace . Inseparable: The defenceless cubs huddle together beneath their mother's foreleg in this picture .

Zoo director Beatrix Koehler said: 'Polar bear cubs are always blind and it takes several weeks before they can start to use their eyes. 'This time round the first view was of their mother which is exactly how it should be. It's great that we manage to capture this moment on camera.'

The launch of Malala Yousafzai’s memoir – I Am Malala – has been cancelled in her home province in north-west Pakistan amid fears that the event could be targeted by the Taliban. The police have reportedly stated that they would not be able to provide security for the launch in Peshawar. Malala was shot and wounded in October 2012 after opposing the Taliban’s restrictions on the education of girls. Scroll down for video . Memoir: Malala tells her story in I Am Malala (left) and is pictured on the right giving a speech after she received the Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience award for 2013 at a ceremony in Dublin . Malala was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and has since made the UK her permanent home. In her book, written with British journalist Christina Lamb, Malala details her extraordinary story and her continued role as an activist. However, she is not universally liked in Pakistan, with some people suspecting that she is being used as a mouthpiece by the West. Pressure to cancel the book launch also came from local government ministers, according to The Daily Telegraph. Sarfraz Khan, director of the Area Study Centre at the University of Peshawar, which was to run the launch with the Bacha Khan Education Trust, is said to have received phone calls from two officials urging him to cancel the launch. Pakistani soldiers shift injured Malala Yousafzai from a helicopter at an army hospital following the attack by gunmen in Peshawar on October 9, 2012 . However, Imran Khan, the head of the PTI party, which has control of the province, said he was dismayed at the decision to cancel Tuesday’s event. He tweeted: ‘Am at a loss 2 understand why Malala's book launch stopped in Peshawar. PTI believes in freedom of speech/debate, not censorship of ideas.’ In October 2013 Malala, accompanied by her father Ziauddin, gave the Queen a copy of her book during a meeting in the palace's White Drawing Room. She told her: 'It is a great honour for me to be here, and I wanted to present you with this book.' Accepting the gift, the Queen replied: 'That's very kind of you.' Malala told the Queen she was passionate about every child having a right to an education, everywhere around the world. She added: 'Especially in this country as well. I have heard about many children that can't go to school, and I want to continue our work.'

Linette Livingstone said she was horrified to discover that her 19-year-old sons Icha and Micha had both been arrested following Sunday's disturbances. The pair were some of the first people to be remanded in custody over the alleged looting. They are accused of taking part in the raid of a Curry's store in Brixton. Arrested: Icha and Micha Livingstone are both in custody for their part in alleged looting in Brixton, but their mother claimed they should have been at the gym . The judge said he was remanding the defendants in custody because he ruled they may rejoin the rioting if they were released. But Ms Livingston, 58, said her two sons were 'good boys' and that 'they don't need to steal.' Speaking to the Evening Standard, she said: 'That is not how I raised them. 'They were just in the area . but the police rounded everyone up and now they are in prison. It will . kill them. 'They are not street wise, they are not like that.' The twins' case is one countless cases being dealt with at magistrates courts across the capital, with sitting being held late into the night. Detained: Police arrest a suspect outside the Curry's store in Brixton, where the twins are alleged to have taken part in the looting . More than 30 people - mostly teenagers . or in their early twenties - appeared in custody at Camberwell . magistrates' court and were remanded as a result of the anarchy. Among those was Byron Cawley, 19, of West Norwood who pleaded guilty to burglary of the Iceland Store in Croydon. He said he was a good guy who had been swept up in anarchy. Appearing via videolink, he told the court: 'I didn't go out to cause trouble or anything. I just got caught up in the wrong situation, I'm not into crime or anything, I just saw this opportunity for food and I didn't really think.' District Judge Tan Ikram refused him bail until he returns to court tomorrow, possibly for sentence.

Ms Robinson told the Daily Telegraph: 'The first I knew of it was when I switched on the television . and saw her trying on the shoes. I couldn't believe it, but lots of . people started to ring me and say that's Shereka on the news. We fell . out earlier this year and have not spoken since May.

People have worked hard to build up their businesses but then they are having them destroyed by the looters and people burning them down.' Leigh had spent most of her life in Tottenham, living in a council flat after becoming pregnant at 17. She later moved to a flat in the High Road, where Saturday's trouble flared. She was later evicted after complaints from neighbours. One resident told the Telegraph: 'She was evicted about four weeks ago and we don't know where she has gone now.

"By . Damien Gayle . Savage: Adrian Hull, who has recently been released after 17 years in jail for a murder, pictured aged 17, at the time of the 'merciless and prolonged' attack . A son of the father of 22 this week spared jail for drug dealing is a killer who murdered his former babysitter in a 'merciless and prolonged' attack, it has emerged. Raymond Hull's son Adrian was just 17 when he battered 29-year-old heroin addict Nicky Morrison to death in Heysham Park, Carlisle, before throwing his body over a bridge. A witness to the killing described how the thug kicked his helpless victim in the head at least 14 times, striking him so hard that his skull bounced off a concrete path. Hull was ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure, with a minimum term of 15 years, for the murder. It is understood that he was released just before Christmas, having served 17 years, and he has already been seen proudly posing for pictures with his freshly notorious father, the Mirror reports. Raymond Hull burst onto the headlines this week when it emerged that he had been spared jail for dealing cannabis to look after his 22nd child, Barry, who is just seven months old. The 58-year-old, who has children by 11 women, is a career criminal with 31 convictions - whose neighbours say lives a lavish lifestyle of foreign holidays, impressive cars and raucous late-night parties in a caravan. Adrian Hull, now 34, already had previous convictions for causing criminal damage, threatening behaviour and arson when he was found guilty of murder. His original trial heard that in 1996 the violent thug beat up Mr Morrison, who used to look after him as a youngster, in a park near his home, before inviting a girl to watch him carry out the murder. Witness Donna Jackson told Carlisle Crown Court he she saw the helpless Mr Morrison lying on the ground gurgling blood. Hull told are to act as lookout while he repeatedly kicked him in the head and stamped on his face. She said the killer had told her that he carried out the attack because Mr Morrison had given information to the police about drug deals carried out by the Hull family. But after Hull was found guilty of murder in 1997, the policeman in charge of the murder inquiry said his investigations had never unearthed the real motive for the killing. 'He wanted to be a bit of a focal point for attention,' said DCI Peter Kirkbride. 'The first thing he did after he attacked Nicky Morrison was to go and tell a girl and then he attacked him in front of her.' The policeman added: 'I think he was trying to create some sort of status for himself.' Spnger: Raymond Hull, 58, burst onto the headlines . this week when it emerged that he had been spared jail for dealing . cannabis to look after his 22nd child, Barry, who is just seven months . old . The dark story of Raymond Hull's fourth-eldest son makes a mockery of the sponger's claim that he is 'a great dad'. In a 2010 appeal by Adrian Hull, Mr Justice Tomlinson, quoted by Carlisle local paper the News & Star, said that the original trial had shown he was raised in 'an unstable and dysfunctional environment'. He added that, in passing sentence, the judge at the original trial had been of 'the view that there was a clear likelihood of serious re-offending' if Hull was released early. 'The trial judge referred specifically to the notoriety of Mr Hull's family in the estate on which he grew up, together with their involvement in crime and drug dealing,' added the senior judge. Raymond Hull's claim to have 22 children came in court as he was convicted of dealing cannabis. Despite police finding a stash of cannabis and text messages from customers, a judge accepted he was helping to raise child number 22 while his partner returned to work. With â€˜considerable hesitationâ€™ the judge went on to impose a suspended sentence.","Raymond Hull's fourth-eldest son Adrian has just been released from jail .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A dog abandoned in Greece because of his extreme bow legs is going from wonky to walkies after being brought to Britain. Sandy, a loveable ten-month-old German Shepherd who is also partially sighted, had faced a life of misery with his crippling deformity. A nutritional problem is thought to have made his front legs seriously bowed and his Greek owner gave up on him. Scroll down for video . Saved: Sandy, a dog with front legs so bent he looked like a crab, has been flown more than 1,600 miles to the UK from Greece for surgery . Careful approach: Sandy is being fixed one leg at a time . Sandy, who is partially sighted, has a wonderful temperament, say those who've met him . His plight came to the attention of Pat Clark, who runs a dogs charity in Cambridge, and she launched an appeal to bring him to Britain. Generous animal lovers donated hundreds of pounds to pay for his transportation and treatment. Sandy arrived a month ago and last week had the initial operation to fix one of his legs with his right being treated first. Cause: It's thought that Sandy's condition came about through malnutrition . The complicated procedures are being carried out for free by surgeon Chaim Pilosof who is a partner at Companion Care vets in Cambridge. Chaim said: ‘So far it has gone really well. At the moment he is on cage rest because he needs to rest a lot but he is already trying to do much more than we allow him to. ‘We are seeing improvements already and he is walking much more comfortably and faster than before and that is just with one leg fixed.’ Expert team: (left to right) Sam Macaulay, Beadetta Marinucci, Kerry-Anne Hanneghan and Chaim Pilosof with Sandy . Chaim and colleagues have also started physiotherapy on Sandy's straightened right leg and hope to carry out hydrotherapy when his left leg has been treated. Other donors have provided the money for other treatment, including an MRI scan at a reduced price and a visit to an eye specialist. The plates needed to straighten his legs, which normally cost around £200, have been donated for free. X-ray: Vets established from scans (left) that Sandy needs plates inserted into his legs and the picture on the right show his leg after a successful operation . Sleep: He's pictured on the left recovering after the operation, along with his toys, and on the right having woken up . Chaim, who is carrying out the operations on his day off, added: ‘A lot of other people have helped with what he needs. ‘A lot of good people have helped him and a lot of people donated money. ‘He is a lovely dog. He is very gentle and loving. You really could not wish for a nicer dog.’ In good hands: Sleepy Sandy with Companion Care staff . The operation on Sandy was carried out by a vet on his day off .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Soviet spies have admitted using bugging devices on the Royal Family and former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Secret agents from the KGB targeted Princess Margaret in the 1960s, attaching listening aids to her lighter, cigarette case, ashtrays and telephones. According to the Sunday Express, they homed in on the Princess during a trip to Copenhagen, Denmark in 1964. Lord Snowdon And Princess Margaret get ready to board a plane in September 1964 ahead of their visit to Copenhagen. Russian spies have admitted bugging the Princess on the trip . Until now, Russia has always denied the covert operation, which took place in a hotel, but has now admitted compiling a dossier on the Princess's love affair with Robin Douglas-Home and further relationships with Roddy Llewellyn, Colin Tennant and Dominic Ewes, a painter who later committed suicide. Spies passed photos, tape recordings and 'most interesting, even scandalous' gossip involving senior royal figures. It is also said agents tried to get information from Margaret's therapist, Kay Kiernan, who also treated the Queen. Intelligence on Prince Phillip was gathered via society osteopath and artist Stephen Ward, who later killed himself at the height of the Profumo affair. But spies failed in a sting operation on then future leader Harold Wilson, setting up a 'honey trap' for him in a Moscow hotel. Princess Margaret (second from right and then left) was targeted by KGB spies on her visit to Copenhagen in 1964. Bugging devices were planted in her lighter, cigarette case, ashtrays and telephones . A new book will detail the KGB spies' attempts at bugging the Royal Family. Pictured, the Kremlin, in Moscow . Female agents posing as prostitutes patrolled the hotel overlooking the Kremlin, with a camera planted in a chandelier in his bedroom. But when the film was developed, Wilson's face was disguised. Colonel Vadim Goncharov, who has since died, was the KGB chief in charge of the snooping operations, and he was ordered by bosses to go on television to deny the claims, fearing they would cast a shadow over the Queen's first and only visit to Russia in 1994. But last week Russia newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda boasted that among Goncharov's successes was 'the bugging of drunken parties of the British Princess Margaret'. A book published next year, Entitled The Kremlin v The Windsors, by the paper's intelligence analyst Gennady Sokolov will provide further details of the operation, according to the paper. Master spy Goncharov, who staged stings in more than 100 countries and survived assassination attempts, said of the Princess Margaret operation: 'As I recall there were no lovers, though there was a visitor. 'On this occasion our interest was in getting confidential information which would open certain doors for us in Britain.' On the failed attempt at trapping Wilson, he said: 'It was if he was playing games with us.'","KGB homed in on Princess during visit to Copenhagen in 1964 .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A Wisconsin father convicted of abuse for starving his teenage daughter down to 68 pounds was sentenced to just five years in prison. Before being sentenced by Dane County Circuit Judge Julie Genovese, Chad Chritten, 42, read a statement insisting his daughter suffered from severe emotional and behavioral problems that he couldn't handle, that his job as a trucker kept him away from home and that he didn't notice how thin she had become. ‘There was no master plan against my daughter,’ the man said, his voice breaking at times. ‘I was bailing water from a sinking boat with my bare hands.’ Failed father: Chad Chritten, 42, was found guilty of starving and neglecting his daughter for a number of years until she escaped wearing only pajamas . The case came to light in February . 2012 when the girl, then 15, ran away from her family's Madison home and . was picked up by a passing motorist. The girl told investigators she . had spent most of the previous five years confined to the home's . basement and was denied food. Genovese . said it was clear the girl had problems and that everyone who . encountered her failed her. But, she told the father, ‘it's your turn to . accept your part in this.’ ‘What . I think you did was put your head in the sand. It's your job as a dad . to see it and you didn't. Really, the buck stops with you,’ the judge . said. Family affair: Stepbrother Joshua Drabek (left) will stand trial next year to face sexual assault allegations, stepmother Melinda Drabek-Chritten (right) is serving a five-year term in prison for beating the teen girl . The girl also told . investigators that her stepmother beat her, her stepbrother repeatedly . forced her to perform oral sex on him and she was forced to eat her . feces and drink her own urine. ‘They . made me feel like I was dehumanized a lot,’ the girl said in a letter . to Genovese. ‘It's all thanks to my stupid dad and stepmom for not . giving me an education and keeping me locked up for most of my life and . making me feel like I was in a scary spot in my life.’ Genovese . sentenced the stepmother, Melinda Drabek-Chritten, to five years in . prison this summer after the woman pleaded no contest to reckless . endangerment and causing mental harm to a child. The stepbrother is set . to stand trial on sexual assault charges next month. The . father went through two trials. Jurors in March deadlocked on some . charges, leading to a second proceeding in November. In all, he was . convicted of child neglect, child abuse, reckless endangerment and . causing mental harm to a child, all felonies. He was acquitted of false . imprisonment and misdemeanor neglect. 'This is so far from a mistake': Assistant District Attorney Matthew Moeser argued during the trial that the abuse ongoing, and hardly an error in judgement . He's a simple man: Defense attorney Jessa Nicholson tried to convince the jury her client didn't have the smarts to mastermind the torture - they didn't bite . During . his November trial, the man testified he believed the girl's stepfather . sexually assaulted her in Texas. After the father brought the girl to . live with him in Wisconsin, she refused to eat and threatened to kill . the family in their sleep, he said. A . psychologist suggested the girl live on a different level than the rest . of the family, he testified, but he denied locking her in the basement. Social workers made several visits to the home, but he couldn't follow . up on her care because he was always on the road. He said social workers . should have removed her from the home. The . man had faced up to 28 years in prison going into Wednesday's . sentencing. District Attorney Ismael Ozanne asked Genovese to give the . man 10 years behind bars, saying he and his wife kept the girl isolated . because they didn't want her to tell anyone she was being abused. ‘The . course of conduct would have ended in (the girl's) death but for her . courage to run away,’ Ozanne said. Asked after the sentencing if he . agreed with five years, he simply said he respected Genovese's decision. No master plan: Mr Chritten is alone with his thoughts as he hangs his head in court . The man's attorney, Jessa . Nicholson, countered he deserved probation. He already has lost his . family and his job, his wife is in prison and his reputation has been . destroyed, she said. ‘Apparently we are still a society that favors punishment,’ she told reporters after the hearing. Genovese . said the man deserved the same sentence as his wife. Together they . stole five years of the girl's life, the judge said.

"By . Damien Gayle . Next summer President Barack Obama will have a slick new pair of wheels to cruise around Martha's Vineyard on. An enterprising bicycle company has designed a model specifically for the needs of the U.S. President, in the hope he'll help popularise the eco-friendly mode of transport. And in a pointed commentary on U.S. foreign policy, Chilean firm Oxford bikes will tell him: 'If we all used a bicycle, there would be no more oil wars.' Bike for peace: Bike One has been specifically designed by Chilean firm Oxford for Barack Obama and will be sent to him to commemorate the anniversary of the beginning of the first Gulf War . Kitted out: The bike includes a range of features useful to a commander-in-chief, including bullet-proof tyres, a BlackBerry charger and space for the briefcase containing the launch codes for America's arsenal of nuclear bombs . It adds: 'In order to commemorate 24 years since the first Gulf War, we are sending Barack Obama a new presidential vehicle, quite a departure from his Air Force and Cadillac One, we are sending him a machine that doesn't run on oil.' Oxford has kitted out its Bike One with all the accessories the commander-in-chief of the world's most powerful country might need. Along with eco-friendly features like dynamo-powered LED lights and an oil-less belt transmission, the bicycle includes bullet-proof tyres, a Blackberry dock and space for the nuclear briefcase. Last summer, Obama showed his love of cycling when he took First Lady Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha on a late Friday morning bike ride through the Manuel F. Correllus State Forest in Martha's Vineyard. On that occasion he was pictured riding the trails on a front-suspension model by all-American cycle maker Trek, but next year perhaps he'll be seen riding his gift from south of the equator. A website showcasing Bike One shows . there is a diplomatic and geo-political rationale behind almost every . feature of the vehicle. 'The . Bike One is equipped with eight gears to showcase diplomatic power in . all topographic conditions: both the plains around Caracas and the Golan . Heights can be comfortably cruised,' it says. Bike . One is equipped with puncture-proof Hutchinson Serenity tires which, . while they aren't really bullet proof, use microcellular foam instead of . air so they can never be punctured. 'Just . like with his Cadillac, Obama can stay calm and rest assured there will . be no suprises along his way, no tacks, no potholes, nothing will ever . puncture his tyres,' says Oxford. According . to the company, Bike One's Brooks B17 saddle - made in Britain from . French leather - will not only help Obama avoid 'missing his favourite . armchair near the pool table at the White House', but also 'consolidates . the oldest and most powerful diplomatic alliances.' And . crucially, there is space for to safely house a sturdy briefcase, like . the one carried around by Obama's party containing the launch codes for . the America's massive arsenal of nuclear weapons. 'This . briefcase is made by Zero Halliburton, a company homonymous to Obama's . predecessor's major contractor during the second Gulf War,' says Oxford. 'This . briefcase is not only safe and beautiful, but also weather proof, . allowing the use of the nuclear button without any weather . restrictions.' Summer fun: President Obama rides with his daughter Malia during their vacation in West Tisbury on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts last summer. Next year we might see him cruising the trails on Oxford's Bike One . Bike One has been on display in Santiago for several days, but at the end of today - the anniversary of the beginning of the first Gulf War - it will be sent to the White House for Obama's personal use. Oxford's marketing manager, Alberto Araya, said he hopes Obama will make regular use of their creation while out in Washington DC. Mr Araya added that he hoped it would 'encourage people into using bicycles and to leave behind other means of transport which pollute, generate stress and are damaging to health.'","Chilean firm to send the bicycle to Obama to mark Gulf War anniversary .

"By . Tamara Cohen . A fireman marches through the still smouldering trees and darkly scorched earth in a scene reminiscent of the aftermath of an Australian bush fire. Elsewhere, flames and billowing smoke rise from what looks like a battlefield and paint the night sky. These extraordinary pictures tell the story of a nation in the grip of drought yesterday – Britain’s hottest day of the year so far – when the tinder-dry conditions suddenly erupted in a series of wildfires. The devastation comes as the Environment Agency today declared more areas as being officially in drought, following another dry month which has hit rivers and groundwater supplies. Scroll down for video . Under control: A fireman walks across devastated scrubland in Newport, Wales. The blaze is believed to have been started by arsonists . Under control: Firemen extinguish flames at Brookwood cemetery in Surrey - the cause is still unknown . Inferno: The night sky is lit up by a blaze along the Scottish border destroying more than 100 acres. Crews battled for more than 12 hours to put it out . In Newport, South Wales, flames raged across 15 acres of scrubland, coming just yards from homes. Terrified residents were forced to use garden  hose pipes to keep away the blaze, which at times licked their properties. Firemen battled for more than five . hours to control the fire, which is believed to have been started by . arsonists near a children’s park. Another blaze raged yesterday over 17 acres of the 500-acre Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey, where more than 235,000 people have been buried since 1854. More than 40 firefighters tackled the flames as fire chiefs warned that the lack of rain and tinder box dry conditions in the South East were the 'perfect recipe' for wildfires. A Surrey Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said today that no properties were affected by the blaze, which was brought under control by around 4pm, two hours after it started. He could not comment on the amount of damage caused to the cemetery - the largest in Britain - and the cause of the fire is unknown. Six fire engines, a water tanker and specialist off-road vehicles were drafted in to attack the flames from different areas, the fire service said. Unbelievable: Firefighters battled for hours in both Newport and Risca yesterday to bring the grass fires under control . Beating it down: A firefighter beats a patch of flames on the common ground at Barrack Hill, known locally as Barracks Wood. Arsonists set the blaze alight, according to South Wales Fire and Rescue Service . Fire service area manager Alan Clark . said wildfires were notoriously difficult to control, adding: 'These . fires cause devastation to the countryside, wildlife and property. 'They pose a risk to life, both to the public and the firefighters tackling these blazes.' Each year, there are around 79,000 wildfires in the UK - an average of 216 per day. Brookwood Cemetery was consecrated by . the Bishop of Winchester on November 7, 1854, and opened to the public . six days later. At the time, it was believed to be the largest burial . ground in the world. Surrey County Council leader David Hodge said: 'These blazes can start for all sorts of reasons. A moment of carelessness could result in devastation to the countryside and lives being put at risk.' As temperatures hit 23c (73f) yesterday, a third fire broke out at St Mary’s Loch in the Scottish . borders, destroying more than 100 acres. Crews battled for more than 12 . hours to put it out. Meanwhile, firefighters were returning to the hills above Harrogate, North Yorkshire, today after they spent yesterday afternoon tackling a large moor fire. Crews from as far away as Tadcaster and neighbouring West Yorkshire were brought in to tackle the blaze on Hanging Moor, above the village of Thruscross, shortly before 2pm. Blaze: And in Scotland a huge grass fire broke out at the foot of Criffel, Galloway, on the northern side of the Solway Firth . Epic: Hundreds of acres of grass and heather has been burning out of control since yesterday on hills overlooking the Solway Firth. In this picture on the right a house stands perilously close to the flames . Burning: The blaze could be seen for miles around and across the Solway in Cumbria. More than 30 firefighters and workers were called to Drumburn Hill between New Abbey and Kirkbean . A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire . Fire Service said a large number of firefighters were needed 'due to the . actual vastness of the moor' and it was burning over three different . fronts. One front is thought to be 200m long. The spokeswoman said there were five different seats of fire identified. One crew was left monitoring the blaze overnight. This morning, she said: 'This fire is . still burning and will continue to for some days. A cause has not yet . been confirmed but further details will be supplied during the next few . days.' A moorland fire in Edenfield, Lancashire, was also under control today following an early morning inspection. Crews from Lancashire and Greater Manchester were called to the blaze off Rochdale Road, near Scout Moor Wind Farm, at about 5pm yesterday. They were confronted with a number of separate pockets of fire covering two square miles in what was described as a 'very large' blaze. Water firm United Utilities also provided specialist all-terrain vehicles to access remote parts of the areas affected, said Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters were withdrawn at 7pm due to fading light after they were satisfied that no property or livestock was at risk. A fire service spokeswoman confirmed the blaze had dissipated when crews returned at 5.30am today to reassess the situation. Drought spreads to Yorkshire, Sheffield and Hull . Swathes of East and South Yorkshire from Chesterfield up to Scarborough are officially suffering from drought, with areas around Sheffield, Doncaster, Hull and Driffield affected. The areas join the South East and eastern England in drought, most of which has been affected since earlier this year, although parts of East Anglia have been suffering drought conditions since last summer. Earlier this month, seven water companies across east and southern England announced hosepipe bans would come into force before Easter in a bid to conserve water supplies in the face of two unusually dry winters. But while the rivers Don, Rother, Hull and Derwent are at low or very low levels for the time of year, the Environment Agency said public water supplies were unlikely to be affected in the region. Yorkshire Water - which serves 4.7million customers - said it did not anticipate any restrictions such as hosepipe bans at the moment. The company said its reservoirs were at 94 per cent, which was normal for the time of year, but groundwater levels in East Yorkshire were around a fifth below usual levels. As a result, the amount of water being taken from aquifers had been reduced and Hull’s water supply was being supported by water drawn from the River Derwent. Location: The fire spread easily, across 15 acres between Comfrey Close, in Allt-yr-yn, and Barrack Hill, known locally as Barracks Wood, towards the TA barracks . In a statement, the company said: 'As . the dry weather continues, we will be keeping the local water resource . situation under constant review. 'Our regional water supply system . gives us flexibility, what it doesn’t give us is an unlimited supply of . water, so we would always encourage our customers to only use what they . need, when they need it.' Some parts of Yorkshire have seen the . driest 12 months since 1910 and river levels are continuing to fall, . prompting the Environment Agency to urge farmers and businesses taking . water from rivers to use supplies wisely. Trevor Bishop, head of water . resources, said: 'Today, south and east Yorkshire have moved into . official drought status, reflecting the impact that this extremely dry . period is having on the environment in the area. 'The Environment Agency must balance . the water needs of people, farmers, businesses and the environment and . we are working with businesses, farmers and water companies to plan . ahead to meet the challenges of a continued drought.' The news of drought conditions . spreading to Yorkshire comes after the Environment Agency warned that . drought would affect more parts of the country without well-above . average rainfall in the coming weeks. And in its latest update last week, . the agency said England and Wales had experienced another dry week, and . in addition to areas in drought parts of the south west and Midlands . were also experiencing dry conditions. The outlook for Wales remained normal, although an exceptionally dry spring and summer could see that change, the EA warned. The Environment Agency has had to . take steps to protect wildlife in the face of drought, including staging . a fish rescue from the River Welland in Lincolnshire this week, moving . fish threatened by low water levels to another, deeper part of the . river. The news of the drought spreading . comes as the Environment Department (Defra) launched a campaign to raise . public awareness of the connection between the health of England’s . rivers and people’s water use. Environment Minister Richard Benyon . said: 'It’s especially important that we care for our rivers when . they’re facing the added pressure of drought, as well as the constant . threats they face from over-use and pollution. 'The fact that so many organisations . have come together to back this campaign shows the depth of feeling . about this issue, and the importance we all place on making sure our . actions don’t damage our rivers.' Paul Wilkinson, head of Living . Landscape for The Wildlife Trusts, said: 'The amazing wildlife of our . rivers and wetlands is under immense pressure from drought and other . factors. 'Many of us would like to help but . don’t know what action to take. There are simple steps around water use . that can make a real difference including turning off taps when cleaning . our teeth.' Hosepipe bans – due to start on April . 5 – have already been imposed by seven water companies in the south and . east of England, affecting 20million customers. Yorkshire Water is one of six firms . which failed to meet leakage reduction targets set by the regular Ofwat . last year, along with Anglian Water and Southern water.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . American lighter company Zippo could face legal action after publishing a photograph of the Olympic torch being lit with one of its lighters without permission to display the logo. The picture shows a man in a black coat using the iconic lighter to re-ignite the torch after it went out while being held by 60-year-old former champion swimmer Shavarash Karapetyan on Sunday. The flame had been blown out by a gust of wind as the retired Soviet-Armenian swimmer carried it along a passageway to the Kremlin in Moscow. Zippo were lightning quick to seize on the marketing opportunity by publishing the image and video shorts across the internet with the hashtag #ZippoSavesOlympics. Scroll down for video . Snuffed out: Zippo faces legal action after using this image of the Olympic torch being re-lit with one of its lighters (seen here on the Facebook page of the firm's Azerbaijani distributor Baku) without permission . The Pennsylvannia-based firm has since removed the picture from its Facebook page after Sochi 2014 officials warned it may be breaching strict rules on companies linking themselves to the Olympics unless they are official sponsors. The image is still on the Facebook page of the company's Azerbaijani distributor Zippo Store Baku. David Warfel, the global marketing director for the Pennsylvania-based company, told RIA Novosti: 'It was never meant to imply that somehow we had any relationship or sponsorship with the Olympic committee at all.' It is not clear what legal steps are open to the organisers, Sochi organising chief Dmitry Chernyshenko told RIA Novosti. Torchbearer and former swimming champion Savarsh Karapetyan indicates that his flame has blown out . Fire starter: A security guard was forced to light the Olympic flame with a lighter after it went out . Back in the game! Dmitry Chernyshenko, president of the Sochi organising committee, said on Twitter that the problem was due to a valve on the torch which had not been opened fully . The flame was lit a week ago in Greece and flown to Moscow for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. However, the glitch occurred when a torchbearer ran through a long passageway leading into the Kremlin which apparently created a wind tunnel, extinguishing the flame. A man standing along the route, most likely part of the presidential security service, pulled out a Zippo lighter and re-lit the flame. Dmitry Chernyshenko, president of the Sochi organising committee, said on Twitter that the problem was due to valve on the torch which had not been opened fully. It was not the first time the flame has been extinguished in Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin was left red-faced on Sunday when he lit the Olympic flame in Red Square only for it to go out. Torchbearer Karapetyan, a champion swimmer for the Soviet Union, once saved 20 passengers from a bus that had fallen into a reservoir. He used his legs to break the back window of the bus as it lay in 10 metres (30 feet) of water, and pulled out 20 of the 92 passengers . Vladimir Putin holds the torch with the Olympic flame during a ceremony in Moscow's Red Square . The relay began in Moscow, where hundreds of athletes and public figures including Prince Albert II of Monaco took part. The flame will now make its way across Russia, travelling from Kaliningrad to the easternmost point of the country just across the Bering Strait from Alaska, before swinging back to Sochi in time for the opening ceremony on February 7. For most of the 65,000 kilometre (39,000-mile) trip, the flame will travel by plane, train, car and even reindeer sleigh, safely encased inside a lantern. But 14,000 torch bearers also will take place in the relay at the more than 130 stops along the way. Vladimir Putin holds the Olympic torch in Moscow's Red Square before it will embark on its tour . Young Russian figure skaters Lina Fedorova, right, and Maxim Moroshkin carry the Olympic torch . One of the silver and red torches, unlit, will be carried into space in November for a brief visit to the International Space Station, and this same torch will be used to light the Olympic flame in Sochi. Putin, for whom the Olympic Games are a source of personal pride, said the relay will 'show the world Russia as she is and as we love her.' It will pass through many cities that showcase the historical, cultural and ethnic richness of Russia, while other cities on the route are more closely associated with the evils of Stalinism, the harsh treatment of dissent under Putin or the Islamic insurgency simmering in the Caucasus Mountains not far from Sochi's ski slopes. As the relay crosses the expanses of Siberia, it will put the spotlight on Russia's immense wealth of natural resources and the rusting of its industrial towns.","The flame had been blown out by a gust of wind during Moscow ceremony .

"By . Damien Gayle . Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt said the change would help to give teachers the same standing as professionals like doctors and lawyers . Teachers would have to be licensed and could be sacked if they fail tough checks on their abilities, under plans unveiled by Labour. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the change would help give teachers the same standing as professionals such as doctors and lawyers. A similar proposal was floated by the previous Labour government - and branded 'classroom MoTs' by former schools secretary Ed Balls. However, it was opposed by some teaching unions and dropped before the 2010 general election. Reviving the controversial plan, Mr Hunt told the BBC he wanted the 'enormously important' role of teachers to be recognised. 'Just . like lawyers and doctors they should have the same professional . standing which means re-licensing themselves, which means continued . professional development, which means being the best possible they can . be,' he said. 'If you're not . a motivated teacher - passionate about your subject, passionate about . being in the classroom - then you shouldn't really be in this . profession.' Teachers would . need to be able to show not only that they are teaching pupils to a high . standard but also that they are keeping their subject knowledge and . skills refreshed through regular training. Those . who fail to demonstrate that they had done so would be refused a . licence to teach, effectively banning them from the profession. Mr . Hunt would not be drawn on how often teachers would be assessed. In . coming months he would be discussing the policy's possible . implementation with professional organisations, he said. Teachers' unions gave Mr Hunt's plan a guarded welcome, insisting that, for it to . work, it must be linked to greater access to high-quality training. 'With . the fragmentation of our education system, access to high-quality . continual professional development has been like finding an oasis in the . desert,' Mary Bousted of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers told . The Times. Brett Wigdortz, founder of education . charity Teach First, said that Mr Hunt's plan would bring the UK into . line with countries like Finland and Singapore, which are renowned for . their education systems. But . Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, . warned against any policy that was a continuation of the Coalition's . 'judgemental prescription of how teachers teach.' Mr Hunt told The Times: 'If we want to re-professionalise the teachers it would be crazy not to do it. 'If teachers are not re-licensed they will not be allowed to teach.' 'Passionate': Teachers would need to be able to show not only that they are teaching pupils to a high standard but also that they are keeping their subject knowledge and skills refreshed through regular training . The Opposition has previously said it would insist on all teachers having Qualified Teacher Status, with staff already working in academies given a deadline to acquire a formal qualification. A Conservative Party spokesman said it was willing to look any proposals which will 'genuinely improve the quality of teaching'. He said: 'We have already taken action by allowing heads to remove teachers from the classroom in a term, as opposed to a year previously, and scrapping the three-hour limit on classroom observations. 'We are improving teacher training, expanding Teach First and allowing heads to pay good teachers more. Thanks to our reforms, a record proportion of top graduates are entering the profession. 'Fixing the schools system so young people have the skills they need is a key part of our long-term economic plan.'","Tristram Hunt revives Ed Balls' old plan for 'classroom MoTs'

"By . Hugo Gye . A heroic RAF pilot who helped defend Britain during the Second World War has died before he was able to see his flying boat raised from the sea where it sank in 1940. Wing Commander Derek Martin OBE was the last person to fly the Sunderland aircraft before it sank during a fierce storm at the dock where it was based. After he helped historians identify the plane, they started to bring it up from the seabed - but the job was not finished by the time Mr Martin died last month at the age of 93. He was an instructor at a training unit based in Pembroke Dock, West Wales when he last flew the Sunderland bomber in 1940 as part of his duties training young airmen. Hero: Wing Commander Derek Martin, pictured left in 1940 and right in recent years, has died aged 93 . Plane: Mr Martin flew a Sunderland flying boat similar to this one during the Second World War . Mr Martin later joined 210 Squadron in Oban, and was badly injured in a crash in 1941. He was treated by the renowned plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe and became a member of the exclusive 'Guinea Pig Club', formed of patients who had undergone experimental procedures. In 1943, Mr Martin returned to flying duties at Pembroke Dock and after the war remained in the RAF for some years, eventually settling in the Berkshire village of Colnbrook with his wife Betty. The Sunderland bomber was flown from Pembroke Dock during the crucial Battle of the Atlantic, which saw the RAF target German U-boats sinking Allied supply ships. The battle raged between 1940 and 1943, killing 6,000 RAF crew who flew up to 600 miles into the Atlantic - but without their efforts, Britain might have been starved into submission by the submarines. Mission: Part of Mr Martin's Sunderland has been retrieved from the water where it sank off Pembroke Dock . Unfulfilled: The last surviving Sunderland has not yet been fully recovered; one of the planes is pictured in its full glory during the Second World War . Winston Churchill wrote: 'The only thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the U-boat peril.' Shortly before his death, Mr Martin said: 'Sunderlands were the only long range British aircraft which could reach the middle of the Atlantic for the first couple of years of the war. 'We would fly out day and night to patrol around the convoys and protect them. 'If you were lucky you would sink a submarine. But just by being there you could force submarines to submerge and not get in a position to torpedo our ships.' Describing the day his aircraft sank, he said: 'I flew it on a routine flight around the dock and then moored it up. 'There was a gale during the night and it must have been holed by some floating debris and down it went. In the morning it wasn't there. Well, it was - at the bottom of the sea.' Discovery: A diver is pictured examining the remains of the plane deep under water . Found: A deep sea diver happened upon the plane after it had lain underwater for six decades . The Mark I Sunderland flying boat was crucial to the war effort as it was deployed to tackle Nazi U-Boats in the Atlantic. It was a military version of the Empire crafts used by Imperial Airways, with a deeper hull and turrets on the nose and tail. Desperate to roll out the new model, the Air Ministry filed an order in 1937 to strengthen defences. The first was received in Singapore in June 1938. By the start of the war, they had a fleet of 40, which acted as one of the major components of the UK's overseas operations for at least the first few months. In total, 75 were built. Initially, it carried 910kg of bombs, mines and other weaponry. A year into the war, amendments were made to combat Nazi tactics. Two Vickers K machine guns were attached to the wing, a second gun was added to the nose turret, and constant speed propellers and de-icing boots were installed. The plane was discovered by a deep sea diver in 2000, after a lobster pot became snagged on its rusting remains. Mr Martin was brought in to identify the Sunderland, which is now surrounded by a 100m exclusion zone while the work to retrieve it continues. John Evans, who is running the conservation operation, said: 'Derek visited a number of times and was a tremendous support to us. 'He piloted this plane and brought that incredible personal link with him - he would've heard the engines roar into life all those years ago. 'Since the plane was first re-discovered around the millennium our volunteers have spent thousands of hours raising the plane in parts. 'We have identified it as Sunderland T9044 of No 210 Squadron, RAF, which sank at its moorings in a gale in November 1940. 'Much of it is covered in mud and sediment - which has preserved the structure and turned it into a perfect time capsule. 'Two of its massive Pegasus radial engines and propellers have been raised from the wreck and are now being conserved and displayed in our museum. 'To raise it all is a massive undertaking but we intend to bring up as much as we can by the 75th anniversary of its sinking in 2015.'","Wing Commander Derek Martin flew a Sunderland plane during the Battle of the Atlantic which allowed Britain to survive .

'This slapping technique doesn't have any scientific base,' says Dr Mica Engel at London-based non-surgical skin clinic, Waterhouse Young. 'The technique has similarities to tapotement, a technique of rhythmic tapping on the body used in Swedish massage. 'But it's unlikely that any long term results can be achieved from that alone. 'Swelling and increased blood flow are normal reactions, but they do not last.' It is unclear where Kim had the procedure, as Iniala Beach House confirmed to Mail Online that the hotel does not offer the treatment.","Kardashian family spent a week at the luxury Iniala Beach Resort, Thailand .

"By . Suzannah Hills . and Ted Thornhill . Raffaele Sollecito has claimed he was not planning to flee to Austria when he was caught by police at a hotel near the national border - but had actually just returned to Italy on hearing the verdict. The 29-year-old was feared to have been considering going on the run just hours after a court gave him a 25-year sentence for killing Meredith Kercher in 2007. He was discovered at 1am at a hotel in Versone, between Udine and . Tarvisio, in north-east Italy, which is just a short drive from the . borders of Austria and Slovenia . But this afternoon he said he set off for Austria after attending court in the morning, ahead of the verdict, because he presumed he would be found innocent. Speaking to NBC, the Italian said he was out of the country when he heard the 'unexpected' ruling and returned immediately. 'As soon as I got the news there was a guilty verdict â€¦ I came right immediately back in Italy,' he said. Scroll down for video . Misunderstanding: Raffaele dismissed reports he was trying to flee Italy this morning and claimed he was actually returning to the country after hearing the guilty verdict . Police apprehended Raffaele Sollecito, pictured left, and his girlfriend - believed to be Greta Menegaldo, pictured right - at a hotel approximately 40 kilometres from the Italian border . Both Raffaele Sollecito and his girlfriend cover up their faces as they leave Udine police station in Italy. It is the first time Sollecito has been photographed in public since the Kercher murder verdict was announced .

Company: Sollecito's girlfriend, believed to be named Greta Menegaldo, can be seen in the passenger seat . Sollecito and his girlfriend left the police station on Friday afternoon after officers confiscated his passport . Swarm: Sollecito, driving the Mini, was found by police near Italy's border with Slovenia and Austria . 'It was completely unexpected. Psychologically, . itâ€™s devastating.' The 29-year-old will now appeal the ruling at Italy's highest court. 'I have to fight until the end,' he added. Judges would not order Sollecito's immediate imprisonment and only ruled that his passport should be confiscated. Sollecito and his girlfriend - believed to be Greta Menegaldo - were stopped by police at the hotel in the small village of Versone - just a few miles from Miss Menegaldo's family home in Tarvision. The cabinet chief of the Udine police . station, Giovanni Belmonte, said Sollecito was calm and came willingly to the station, with his girlfriend driving behind. They took him to the Udine police . station, confiscated his passport and put a stamp in his Italian . identity papers showing that he cannot leave the country. He was released this afternoon. Asked if police thought he might have . planned to flee the country, Belmonte said: 'We don't know his . intentions.' But he said police were tipped off to his presence in the . hotel and came immediately. Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . Raffaele Sollecito was apprehended by police at a hotel in Venzone, in between Tarvision and Udine, north-east Italy, which are close to both the borders of Austria and Slovenia . The Carnia hotel in Venzone, Italy, where police are believed to have found Sollecito with his girlfriend . A typical room inside the Hotel Carnia, pictured, where the couple were staying after Sollecito discovered judges had found him guilty of the murder of Meredith Kercher . Sollecito was in court yesterday to hear the final submissions but left before the judges retired to consider the verdict. Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of Meredith Kercher, pictured . When judges announced Sollecito's guilty verdict, they also ordered his passport be surrendered after noting that there was a 'real and actual the danger that Sollecito could escape Italian justice'. Sollecito's U.S. attorney John Q. Kelly told the Today . show on Friday that his client was simply staying away from media . hotspots and had wanted to be far from the courthouse when the verdict . was read. Mr Kelly said that to say Sollecito was 'stunned was an understatement'. The lawyer said no one expected the verdict in a case where there is 'no witnesses, no physical, no motive'. He . said that his client had chosen to be home in Italy while the court . made its decision to 'be with family, friends and those who love and . support him'. It was the third trial for Knox and Sollecito, whose first two trials in the 2007 slaying of British exchange student Meredith Kercher produced flip-flop verdicts of guilty, then innocent. After the acquittal in 2011, Knox returned to the U.S., where she evidently hoped to put herself beyond the reach of Italian law. But Italy's supreme court soon ordered a third trial. On Thursday, the panel of two judges and six lay jury members deliberated 11 hours before issuing its decision, stiffening Knox's original 26-year sentence, apparently to take into account an additional conviction for slander, while confirming Sollecito's 25-year term. But in Italy, verdicts are not considered final until they are confirmed, usually by the supreme Court of Cassation.  Sollecito was allowed to remain free pending the outcome of the appeal but was told to hand over his passport to authorities. Sollecito's lawyers said they were stunned by the conviction. 'There isn't a shred of proof,' attorney Luca Maori said. In . court: Raffaele Sollecito, pictured arriving at court in Florence, . Italy, yesterday for the final hearing ahead of his guilty verdict in . the latest Meredith Kercher murder trial, had his passport confiscated . Verdict: The judge in the courthouse of Florence reads the final guilty verdict after 11 hours of deliberations . Kercher, 21, was found dead in a pool of blood in the bedroom of the apartment she and Knox shared in the town of Perugia, where they were studying. Kercher had been sexually assaulted and her throat slashed. Knox and Sollecito denied any involvement in the killing. After initially giving confused alibis, they insisted they were at Sollecito's apartment that night, smoking marijuana, watching a movie and making love. Prosecutors originally argued that Kercher was killed in a drug-fueled sex game gone awry - an accusation that made the case a tabloid sensation. But at the third trial, a new prosecutor argued that the violence stemmed from arguments between roommates Knox and Kercher about cleanliness and was triggered by a toilet left unflushed by a third defendant, Rudy Hermann Guede. Guede, who is from the Ivory Coast, was convicted in a separate trial in a verdict that specified he did not commit the crime alone. He is serving a 16-year sentence. Lawyers for both Knox and Sollecito have said they will appeal to the Court of Cassation. Raffaele Sollecito pictured in court yesterday for the final submissions ahead of the judges' deliberations . Support: Raffaele Sollecito is flanked by his stepmother Mara Papagni, left, and his aunt Sara Achille, right, as he leaves court after attending the final hearing before the third verdict for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher . Meanwhile, Ms Kercher's family called for Knox to be extradited from the US after the 26-year-old said the only way she would go back to Italy was 'kicking and screaming'. The victim's brother, Lyle Kercher, told a press conference in Florence: 'If somebody is found guilty and convicted of a murder and if an extradition law exists between those two countries, then I don't see why they wouldn't. 'I imagine it would set a difficult precedent if a country such as the US didn't choose to go along with laws that they themselves uphold when extraditing convicted criminals from other countries. 'It probably leaves them in a strange position not to.' Ms Kercher's sister Stephanie said the family was still on a 'journey for the truth' and admitted they were coming to terms with the possibility of never knowing what had happened to Meredith. 'You can't ever really get to a point where you just start to remember Meredith solely because it is following the case, coming over to Italy and everything associated with it. 'But the verdict has been upheld this time so we hope that ... obviously come the end of the trial, we are nearer the truth and an end so that we can just start to remember Meredith for who she was and draw a line under it, as it were.' When asked if the Kercher family would want to meet Knox, she replied: 'It's not something that we would want to do at the moment and I can't say that we ever will.'

"By . Richard Spillett . A former U.S. army sergeant who became one of America's best-loved beauty queens is now set to host her own hunting show. Theresa Vail became only the second ever army recruit to take part in the Miss America contest last year when she represented Kansas. But while most competitors go on to get modelling contracts, 23-year-old Miss Vail has signed up to host a show with the US Outdoor Channel. Scroll down for video . Former U.S. Army sergeant Theresa Vail became a huge hit in America when she refused to cover her tattoos while representing Kansas. She's now planning to put her military training to good use by hosting a hunting show on U.S. TV . She'll be hunting elk, deer and bear in the new show on the Outdoor Channel . Producers of the show say they are amazed by Miss Vail's hunting skills . She'll be showing off her passion for stalking deer and other mountain animals in a programme she hopes will 'empower women'. Miss Vail enlisted in the army when she was 17 and is a section leader for the Kansas Army National Guard's Medical Attachment. She was inspired to go into the armed forces by her father, who is a dentist in the Army and has been a soldier for 33 years, and she has a tattoo of the insignia of the Army Dental Corps on her left shoulder. She shot to fame in the U.S. when she became the first contestant to openly display her tattoos at the Miss America beauty pageant. The inking on her right side states: 'God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.' The former Miss America contestant will be promoting a new range of camouflage clothing in the show . Miss Vail is said to be a first-class marksman and will be hunting using her archery bow . She raised eyebrows last year when she arrived for the Miss America contest wearing her army backpack . Despite narrowly missing out on the Miss America 2014 title, she won the 'America's Choice' award, decided by an online vote. In her latest move, she's signed up to host 'Limitless', a hunting show for US TV which is set to hit screens next year. Despite being known as a crack-shot marksman, she told the Wichita Eagle: 'I'm not afraid to say, ""Hey, I don’t know how to do this"" but I want to learn and do it myself. 'That's empowering and more people need to do it. I will learn how and that’s the kind of thing that makes me so proud.' Miss Vail followed her father, Mark, into the military and has recently signed up for another six years with the Kansas Army National Guard's Medical Detachment . Miss Vail has not been afraid to follow a different path to many of her fellow beauty queens . The show, which Miss Vail began filming this month, will feature her taking part in three hunts for elk, several for deer and possibly one for bear. She'll also be taking part in a number of extreme challenges, including training with New Mexico's Smoke Jumper firefighters and running in a desert marathon. While hunting a number of animal with a bow and arrow, she'll be modelling a new camouflage range for an outdoor clothing firm. She has previously campaigned to get more girls into hunting, camping and outdoor activities. On her website, Miss Outdoor Girl, she writes: 'When girls learn they have what it takes to “hang with the guys” they feel a sense of internal strength, like they can conquer the world and take care of themselves. 'It is an immense confidence-booster and a great way for young girls to find themselves. This takes them out of the partying/drinking scene, and into the most natural of environments. I truly believe my platform will build responsible and respectable young.'","Miss Kansas Theresa Vail switched from the shooting range to the catwalk .

I was wondering why you weren't checking the messenger...' But then she said: 'Me too son, I love you.' The student is reported to have been rescued and has since been reunited with his family. Waiting: A woman prays behind her mobile phone at Danwon High School in Ansan. Family members of those unaccounted for sent messages to those trapped inside, reassuring them help was on its way . Submerged: Only a small part of the boat is now visible above the surface of the water as rescuers desperately try to find the missing passengers . The brother of passenger Woong Gi tried to reassure him that rescuers were on their way. 'Keep calm, don't panic, take your time, stay sharp, and do as they say,' he said. 'When data works contact me again, your brother.' Police however have said hoax messages from people purporting to be on board have begun circulating. The captain of the ferry has been accused of abandoning the ship and could face . charges of negligence. Reports . suggest Lee Joon-seok, 69, was one of the first to jump to safety from . the stricken vessel while many passengers were told to 'stay put' by . rescuers. It comes as allegations suggest only one of the 46 lifeboats were deployed as the boat began to sink. Footage . showing the white survival capsules still attached to the vessel is . believed to have emerged as the coast guard and maritime police . frantically try to reach those trapped on board. As the search operation entered its second day, rescuers were hammering on the upturned hull hoping for a response from hundreds of people. Reports said submersibles were pumping oxygen into the hull, although the coastguard declined to comment. The vessel capsized on Wednesday during a short journey from the port of Incheon to the holiday island of Jeju. Hundreds . of relatives were forced to wait on Jindo Island, the nearest piece of . land to the scene, for news of their loved ones. Operation: Dozens of vessels, including fishing boats, are into the second day of the hunt for the missing passengers. More than 470 people were on board the Sewol when it sank . Emotional: A relative breaks down in tears on Jindo, where family members have been forced to wait while the rescue operation continues . Anger: South Korean Prime Minister Chung Hong-won (centre) is hit by a water bottle thrown by a frustrated family member of a missing passenger . Probe: Lee Joon-Seok, captain of the South Korean ferry, (pictured in the grey hoody) is being investigated by police . Grieving parents accused officials of being slow to react and for lack of information. 'I am really angry with the government,' said Kwak Hyun-ok, whose daughter who was one of 340 children and teachers from one school on the vessel. One parent, Park Yung-suk, saw the body of her teenage daughter's teacher brought ashore earlier in the morning. 'If I could teach myself to dive, I would jump in the water and try to find my daughter.' The last major ferry disaster in South Korea was in 1993, when 292 people were killed.","People on board reached for their phones as the Sewol ferry began to list .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Scientists have discovered that acid could improve the prospects of successfully treating Alzheimer’s, heart disease and stroke. It may seem counter-intuitive that a destructive substance could improve health, but experts from the Riken Centre for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan, said that mild acid can be used to revert cells back to a neutral state from which they can be turned into a variety of other cells. This is a big step forward for the science of growing organs and tissue, vital in the battle against a range of diseases including Alzheimer’s, spinal cord injury, stroke, heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Scientists believe that acid could be used in the battle against a range of diseases (file picture) Researchers from the Riken Centre found that exposing mice cells to mildly acidic conditions caused them to reset to a blank state within 30 minutes, The Daily Telegraph reports. Experts believe that from this state any type of cell at all can be nurtured. Cambridge University’s Professor Austin Smith wrote in Nature: ‘Remarkably, instead of triggering cell death or tumour growth as might be expected a new cell state emerges that exhibits an unprecedented potential for differentiation into every possible cell type. ‘ . The breakthrough means the cure for some major diseases could come from within patients. The acid research could be vital in the race to find a cure for Alzheimer's, which affects millions of elderly people (file picture) Professor Chris Mason, chairman of regenerative medicine bioprocessing at University College London said: ‘If it works in man, this could be a game changer that ultimately makes a wide range of cell therapies available using the patient’s own cells.’ The research follows news that Swedish scientists say they have written the recipe for making ethically acceptable, highly versatile stem cells in large numbers that could be banked and turned into treatments for patients who need to replace diseased, damaged and worn out body parts. Researchers from Stockholm’s Karolinska Institute say they have found a way of safely removing a single, precious stem cell from an embryo and worked out how to make the lone cell grow and multiply, using a lab-made version of a protein that is found in the embryo.","Researchers found that cells can be reverted to a blank state using acid .

"By . Associated Press . A former city official who became a . symbol of municipal greed was sentenced Wednesday to 12 years in prison â€” less than half the time it will take the nearly bankrupt Los Angeles . suburb of Bell to dig itself out of the estimated $150 million in debt . he left behind. A judge . also ordered former Bell city manager Robert Rizzo to make $8.8 million . in restitution, but prosecutors say that only covers the money he . illegally took for himself. In . all, Rizzo cost the modest city more than $150 million in legal fees . and illegally collected taxes that must be repaid, said prosecutors and . Bell officials. 'That resulted in borrowing that will not be paid back until 2040,' Anthony Taylor, an attorney representing the city of Bell, told Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy. Fat cat: Robert Rizzo, left, leaves court after being sentenced, Wednesday April 16, 2014 in Los Angeles . Rizzo . was arrested in 2010 after it was revealed that he was paying himself . an annual salary and benefits package of $1.5 million to run a city . where a quarter of the population lives below the federal poverty line. His $800,000 in wages alone was double that of the president of the . United States. His top . assistant had a salary and benefits package of $564,000 and most Bell . City Council members were getting about $100,000 a year. Several other . top officials were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars. Former . assistant city manager Angela Spaccia was sentenced last week to nearly . 12 years in prison and five former council members face as much as four . years when they are sentenced later this year. Kennedy, however, said the entire scam could be traced to Rizzo. 'Rizzo . was controlling everything,' the judge said, noting he doled out . millions of dollars in illegal loans to pretty much anybody who asked . and raised salaries to levels the judge called 'absolutely ridiculous.' 'Nobody wanted to upset the apple cart because they were being paid so well,' she added. Pay up: Rizzo, right, the City of Bell administrator, listens as he is sentenced to 12 years in state prison with his attorney James W. Spertus, left, at his side. Rizzo was also ordered to pay $8,845,000 in restitution to Bell . When . somebody did complain, Kennedy said, Rizzo got rid of them, and when . some members of the public began to catch on, he falsified public . records to hide the fraud. Rizzo, . who was Bell's city manager for 18 years, told the judge he ran 'a very . good, tight ship' for the first 12 years but then went astray when he . began to put himself, not city residents, first. 'I'm very, very sorry for that. I apologize for that. If I could go back and make changes, I would,' he said. By . the time he was arrested, Rizzo had amassed a fortune. He owned a horse . ranch in Washington state, several thoroughbred racehorses and an . expensive home in Huntington Beach. Kennedy said she appreciated the apology. 'But it doesn't change the fact that, Mr. Rizzo, you did some very, very bad things for a very long time,' she said. On . Monday, Rizzo was sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for income . tax evasion. Kennedy said he would be transferred to a state prison . after that time was served. She allowed him to remain free until May 30 . after being assured his $2 million bail would be forfeited if he doesn't . surrender on that day. Dodgy player: Rizzo's corruption scheme nearly bankrupted the small, blue-collar city . Rizzo's . attorney, James Spertus, had asked Kennedy to impose a five-year . sentence. The lawyer said outside court that he wasn't surprised by the . longer term. He expects Rizzo, 60, to be free in about six years after . time off is granted for good behavior. The . sentencing of Rizzo brought the case close to an end four years after . the Los Angeles Times first reported the true salaries of Rizzo and . others. It was later . learned that City Hall had illegally raised property taxes, business . license fees, sewage fees and trash collection fees; illegally diverted . gas taxes and other state and federal funds; and issued $50 million in . voter-approved bonds for a park that was never built. Much of the money was used to cover the huge salaries of city officials. Rizzo, who hasn't spoken publicly since the scandal began, talked briefly with two reporters outside the courthouse. 'I . should have realized that the salaries were way out of whack and taken . steps to bring them back into line, but it just got away from me and . there wasn't much I could do after a period of time,' he said after . pausing to gather his thoughts. Several . others in city government were well aware of what was going on, he said . before adding, 'I don't want to rat anybody out.' After a passer-by shouted at him that justice had finally been served, Rizzo smiled, shook hands and said, 'I've got to go.'","A judge also ordered former Bell city manager Robert Rizzo to make $8.8 million in restitution .

"By . Leon Watson . A dog owner was mortified to hear his Border Collie was responsible for causing a town's residents six months of misery slashing car tyres. Edward and Jean Morgan were shown CCTV footage of their very own Border Collie, named Jess, caught red-handed slashing a neighbour's car - evidence that cracked the case of the culprit responsible for months of vandalism. Officers were left clueless when residents in Brampton, Cumbria, started to regularly report damage to their tyres. Solved: The phantom car vandal of an old market town was finally unmasked as Jess the Border Collie . Eventually, residents in the street were so annoyed they installed CCTV to try and catch who was responsible. And, after spending six months and countless hours studying CCTV police got the lead when it transpired that Jess had been using her daily walk to bite the two nearside tyres of cars she came across - causing slow punctures and flat tyres by morning. Jess had been allowed off her lead while being walked by her owners and had been nipping the tyres without them noticing. Jean and Edward Morgan have reimbursed fellow residents since the matter Jess' actions were revealed . Edward Morgan and Jess was revealed to be the cause of a spate of car tyres being ripped over a period of six months . Mrs Morgan, 76, a retired Civil Servant, said: 'We are both just mortified. 'She is the most obedient and affectionate dog we have ever had and it is just shocking to hear this terrible news. 'We are very distressed by what has happened.I couldn't believe it when I saw the CCTV footage. 'To think that Jess has done this has made me feel very sad.' A spokeswoman for Cumbria Police confirmed ten reports of vandalism had been reported in the last six months. It is believed, though, that there will be other residents who have suffered flat tyres because of Jess and thought nothing of it. Residents were upset that car tyres had been left repeatedly punctured over the past six months so set up CCTV in the village of Brampton, Cumbria . The elderly couple have reimbursed fellow residents since the matter was resolved. The couple have have had Jess for two-and-a-half years. Mrs Morgan added: 'I have had six dogs over the last 50 years and none have ever been like Jess. 'When I call her she comes straight away. 'This is why we usually don't walk her on her lead. She is such a lovely dog and very spirited. 'From now on though, we will have to start to walk her on her lead. The couple have have had Jess for two-and-a-half years and said 'she must get over-excited when she has had a good run' 'Border Collie's are hard working dogs, and are trained to nip sheep. I think she must get over-excited when she has had a good run.' The mechanic at a local car garage who has been inundated with punctures in recent months said: 'I was having to replace car tyres every couple of weeks. 'Everyone thought it was someone with a knife. 'I am glad it is resolved now, but it is very unfortunate for the people involved.' PC Simon Amos, who solved the mystery, said: 'These incidents have been happening for the last six months, with many residents being very upset at the thought of someone targeting them and causing the damage deliberate. 'The dog had been seen approaching the cars and many believe that she was just sniffing at the tyres. It isnâ€™t until you take a closer look , that you can see her biting the tyres. 'The owner has been contacted and has been very surprised and also apologetic about the whole situation. He will be now keeping Jess on a lead. 'We know that there may be other residents or visitors that may not have reported any damage to their tyres. We want to reassure them that the culprit has been identified and hopefully the damage will stop.'","Car owners in Brampton, Cumbria, repeatedly reported damage .

"By . Damien Gayle . Is this the mystery collector? Art sources claim Las Vegas tycoon Elaine Wynn is the buyer who paid nearly $150m for Francis Bacon's triptych . The mystery of who bid nearly $150million to buy Francis Bacon's 'Three Studies of Lucian Freud' at a New York auction has apparently now been solved. After months of speculation, art world sources claim that casino tycoon Elaine Wynn was the telephone bidder who helped make the triptych the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction. Ms Wynn, the former wife of well-known art collector Stephen Wynn, who co-founded their Las Vegas casino empire, is estimated by Forbes to have a net worth of $1.9billion. She is understood to be a fan of . Irish-born artist Bacon and has previously shown interest in buying his . other triptychs as they have come on the market. Ms . Wynn is not the first person to be linked to the record-breaking . purchase of Bacon's triptych, with Qatari royal Sheikha Mayassa and . Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich both previously touted as buyers. The . 1969 work - never before been offered at auction and carrying a . pre-sale estimate of $85million - sold for $142.4million after a . protracted bidding war in a packed saleroom and via telephone. Christie's did not disclose the identity of the successful buyer. Ms . Wynn's office told the New York Times that she was away and could not . be reached for comment. But the paper claims that sources close to her . say that Bacon is one of her favourite artists. The triptych is currently on loan to the Portland Art Museum in Oregon, where it is on display until March 30. At . the time of the sale, Christies said that Bacon's three-paneled work, . which depicts the Dublin-born painter's friend and fellow artist Lucian . Freud on a chair, was 'a true masterpiece that marks Bacon and Freud's . relationship' and their 'creative and emotional kinship.' Masterpiece: Francis Bacon's 1969 triptych . 'Three Studies of Lucian Freud' which sold for . $142.4million at a Christie's auction in New York last November. Art world sources say the buyer was casino tycoon Elaine Wynn . 'The juxtaposition of radiant sunshine yellow contrasting with the brutal physicality and immediacy of the brushstrokes in this celebrated life-size triptych is what makes Bacon's art so remarkable,' said Francis Outred, the head of European postwar and contemporary art for Christie's. 'This suddenly becomes a very important conversation between two masters,' Outred said in an interview. He noted that 'Three Studies of Lucian Freud' is one of only two existing full-length triptychs of Freud, a grandson of the founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud, and that the three panels were separated for 15 years in the Seventies before being reunited.","Elaine Wynn is believed to have bid for the masterpiece by telephone .

"By . Hugo Gye . Renowned Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei has chosen the unlikely setting of a 'sort of field in Yorkshire' for his next exhibition. The anti-government icon is banned from leaving China, but has allowed a selection of his works to be sent to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park near Wakefield. Among the pieces set to go on display are a number which allude to the artist's detention in virtual house arrest, where he is monitored around the clock by the Communist Party authorities. Exhibition: Ai Weiwei's Iron Tree will be featured in an exhibition at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park . Star: The Chinese artist rose to fame in Britain thanks to his 'Sunflower Seeds' exhibition at the Tate Modern . The Yorkshire Sculpture Park uses the grounds of a country estate to showcase monumental works in a rural setting - not a natural environment for subversive Chinese art. But when curators wrote to Mr Ai suggesting that he should lend his sculptures to the park, he enthusiastically agreed. The centrepiece of the exhibition will be a selection from his work Fairytale - 1001 Chairs, an arrangement of furniture from the Qing dynasty, which is meant to highlight how difficult it is for Chinese citizens to leave their country. The chairs will be set up in the park's 18th-century chapel, in an arrangement requested by Mr Ai himself, allowing visitors to sit and meditate on those who have used both the chairs and the chapel before them. He has also lent a brightly coloured ceramic re-creation of a 'ruyi', traditionally seen as conferring authority on whoever possesses it. Venue: The exhibition will take place in this 18th-century chapel in the grounds of the park near Wakefield . Antiques: These Qing dynasty chairs form another artwork which Mr Ai has lent to the exhibition . The . artist's 20ft-tall Iron Tree will be set up in the chapel's courtyard, . while ceramic lanterns which allude to the lightshades Mr Ai has hung . from the surveillance cameras surrounding his home will be on display . inside. A . series of readings from the works of the artist's father Ai Qing, a . dissident poet, will be performed in the chapel during the exhibition, . which opens on May 24. Curator Clare Lilley said that the park did not expect Mr Ai to be so keen to work with them. 'There . has to be a really important reason why an artist would want to do . something in a sort of field in Yorkshire,' she told The Times. 'We . are incredibly surprised, really grateful that he has been able to give . this any time at all, we know the difficulties he has.' Controversy: Mr Ai pictured tussling with police outside his home in Beijing where he is under virtual house arrest . Protest: Pro-democracy advocates holding posters of Ai Weiwei during a demonstration in Hong Kong . Mr Ai, 56, rose to celebrity in Britain after he was commissioned by the Tate Modern to fill the buildings turbine hall with 1million hand-painted porcelain 'sunflower seeds' in 2010. He is now one of China's best-known artists, having helped to design the 'Bird's Nest' stadium which hosted the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. However, he has had his passport confiscated by the authorities after repeatedly speaking out against the regime's human rights record. In 2011, he was arrested and imprisoned over claims he had evaded tax, in a case widely condemned by the international community.","Ai Weiwei, 56, is banned from travelling outside China due to dissident views .

"By . Snejana Farberov . One of the unintended consequences of the legalization of marijuana in a growing number of states has been a rise in pot-related poisonings involving pets. Animal Poison Control Center has reported a 30 per cent jump in the number of calls reporting dogs and cats suffering from marijuana poisoning between 2009 and 2013. According to veterinary experts, the vast majority of the incidents are accidental; dogs tend to rummage through trash and, being indiscriminate eaters, they scarf down anything they come across. Scroll down for video . Stoner dogs: Animal Poison Control Center has reported a 30 per cent jump in the number of calls reporting dogs and cats suffering from marijuana poisoning between 2009 and 2013 . Dr Matt Booth, of Colorado – a state that legalized recreational marijuana this year - told NBC News his veterinary emergency service sees about a case of pet poisoning a month. According to veterinarians, dogs and cats react very differently to the effects of cannabis compared to their human counterparts. If pets consume a small amount of pot, for example in the form of marijuana butter, they become listless or depressed. When ingesting higher doses, our four-legged friends - who lack a liver enzyme needed to break down THC - can lose coordination, become incontinent, turn hyperactive and experience body tremors. 'They stagger around dribbling urine everywhere,' said Dr Tima Wismer, of the Animal Poison Control Center. Munchies: Dogs being indiscriminate eaters, they wolf down anything they come across, including marijuana-laced products that can leave them listless, and in some cases land them in a coma . Other symptoms of marijuana poisoning in dogs include high blood pressure, a drop in heart rate and body temperature, seizures, and in some of the more serious cases, even coma and death. That is what happened to San Francisco veterinarian Jill Chase's Tibetan terrier, who effectively overdosed on cannabis-infused butter he had found in the trash, San Francisco Chronicle reported in December. The pooch spent three days in a coma, but eventually recovered after being treated with IV fluids. Pot brownies can be especially harmful to fido because they combine marijuana-infused butter boasting high levels of THC - the main ingredient in cannabis - with chocolate, which is a known heart and nervous system stimulant in dogs. A study by Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society cited by The Coloradoan found that cases of marijuana poisoning in pets has increased fourfold at two Colorado hospitals between 2005 and 2010 - a time span that coincided with a rise in the number of registered medical marijuana users. The study looked at 125 cases involving stoned pets at Wheatridge Veterinary Specialists in Denver and Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Only two incidents included in the report resulted in fatalities: a dog and a horse died after eating marijuana-infused baked goods and choking on their own vomit. The Pet Poison Hotline, which accepts calls from around the country and Canada, has seen a 200 per cent increase in poisoning cases in the past five years. Experts say dogs can get high from ingesting bong water (left), but it is baked goods like pot brownies (right) that pose the greatest risks because they combine THC with chocolate, which is inherently harmful to pets . A 2002 study by the American SPCA's Animal Poison Control Center found that 96 per cent of accidental marijuana poisonings occurred in dogs, with 3 per cent in cats and the remaining 1 per cent in other animals. If a dog has ingested marijuana, veterinarians say one of the ways to treat the sickened pet would be to induce vomiting, or feed it activated charcoal to absorb the THC in the pooch's system. In some cases, IV fluids may be required to get rid of the toxins. Veterinarians urge pet owners to avoid leaving marijuana-laced edibles, such as cookies and brownies, unattended.","Dogs and cats who ingest pot can land in a coma because they lack liver enzyme that breaks down THC .

"By . Ap . A federal judge in Philadelphia has declined to approve deals for another batch of retired players suing the NFL over concussion-linked claims. U.S. District Judge Anita Brody's preliminary ruling Wednesday follows a similar ruling in January on the proposed $765 million umbrella settlement. She is skeptical that the fund is large enough to cover up to 20,000 players for 65 years, as intended. Brody's latest ruling involves a group of plaintiffs led by Kevin Turner, a former Philadelphia Eagle now battling Lou Gehrig's disease. Da Bears: Former Bears quarterback Jim McMahon is one of at least 10 NFL hall-of-famers who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the league . Skeptical: Judge Anita Brody has rejected the settlement with the league because she doesn't think $765 million is enough to cover the full extent of the damages . The judge also denied the Turner group class-action status, at least for now. Attorney Sol Weiss, representing the players, insists the deal is fair and sufficient to cover their needs. Weiss says he believes most players will sign on rather than spend years fighting the NFL in court. The surprise settlement emerged last summer, after several months of closed-door meetings with a mediator. ALS: Former Philadelphia Eagles fullback Kevin Turner suffers from Lou Gehrig's Disease and led the lawsuit against the NFL . Young players with severe brain injuries would get up to $5 million under the deal, though most players would get far less. Those without neurological problems would get medical screening, and follow-up care if needed. The awards would depend on a retiree's age and diagnosis. For instance, young men with serious dementia would get $3 million, while an 80-year-old with early dementia would get $25,000. But in January, Brody wrote: 'Even if only 10 percent of retired NFL football players eventually receive a qualifying diagnosis ... it is difficult to see how the monetary award fund would have the funds available over its lifespan to pay all claimants at these significant award levels.' At the time, she also asked for more actuarial details and appointed a finance expert to assist her. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has been criticized for not doing enough to prevent players from getting concussions .","Judge Anita Brody is skeptical that the settlement reached will cover players who will experience concussion-linked problems in the future .

"By . Damien Gayle . If you'd just fallen through a ceiling at work, you might expect a little help. But none was forthcoming for hapless shop worker Ryan Veltkamp, whose colleague appeared completely unconcerned at his plight. Despite coming crashing down surrounded by debris, the assistant at Baneberry Golf and Resort in Tennessee was met with indifference from his co-worker and a customer browsing the store. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'That hurt': Ryan Veltkamp lies on the floor after coming crashing through the ceiling at the shop at Baneberry Golf and Resort in Tennessee, in scenes captured on the shop's CCTV cameras on December 30 . A remarkable video shows the moment Mr Veltkamp came plummetting from the loft of the shop on December 30. At . first, all seems quiet in the golfing supplies retailer, its . surveillance camera looking out on a peaceful and apparently average . day. Then, about 20 seconds . into the clip, a crunching, cracking sound is heard and, just a second . later, Mr Veltkamp drops onto the shop floor, surrounded by debris. He lands apparently quite heavily on his upper back, and just lies there. At this point, his colleague saunters over and says: 'Hey Ryan.' 'Hey Billy,' Mr Veltkamp replies. 'That hurt.' 'Alright, don't move a muscle,' his colleague tells him. Another man, apparently a customer, then walks over and asks, incredibly: 'Why is there a hole in the ceiling?' 'Hey Ryan': Mr Veltkamp's colleague doesn't seem overly concerned at the catastrophic mishap . 'Why is there a hole in the ceiling?' A customer shows off a complete lack of any kind of powers of deduction . Despite claiming to be okay and trying to get up, Mr Veltkamp eventually thinks better of it and chooses to just stay lying where he has fallen. Trevor Tam of Warrior Custom Golf, the company which manages the shop, told Golf.com that Mr Veltkamp had been in the attic, ironically searching for the wires that eventually captured his fall. Thankfully, according to Mr Tam, Mr Veltkamp was 'completely unharmed' in the accident and, after a few days, they were 'able to see the comedy of it all' and made the video public.","CCTV captured the moment Ryan Veltkamp came plummeting into the shop .

The 24-year-old was giving his parents the guided tour of the house in Borth y Gest, near Porhmadog, in north west Wales, when he found the 16lb artillery shell which was packed with high explosives. Mr Southall, the owner of Sea View Tea Rooms which is six doors away from his new property, said: 'I had only just got the keys to my house on Friday so thought I'd start some work on it.

The artillery shell and the detonator were taken down to Black Rock Sands and detonated. 'Everyone could hear it around Borth y Gest and Morfa Bychan,' said Mr Southall.  I've been told the explosion actually left a crater on the beach.'

"By . Emma Reynolds . A desperate jobseeker who applied for 15,000 jobs with no success in the past ten years has resorted to advertising himself by wearing a 'hire me' sandwich board. Robin Norton, from Birmingham, has a Masters degree in history and several NVQs but has been overlooked by an endless slew of employers. He has now taken drastic action, spending an entire day wearing a sign reading 'hire me please' and walking up and down the M5 slip-road at Bromsgrove junction in Worcestershire. Extreme move: Robin Norton stood by the motorway wearing a sandwich board for a day in the hope of finding employment . Mr Norton said: 'I have applied for around 25 jobs a week for the past ten years without getting anywhere. 'Sometimes I have applied for as many as 50 in one week. It is never-ending. 'I barely even get a response either, even just an email to say they had received my application but have not been accepted. 'I am looking for any full-time work - I’m not picky.' Mr Norton, who worked for the Royal Mail for seven years, was a self-employed footcare technician until 2002 when his business went under. Since then he has had odd-jobs including cleaning, gardening and building work, but craves the stability of full-time employment. Reaching his limits: Mr Norton has a Masters degree in history and several NVQs but has been overlooked by employers . He said: 'Things were bad before but have become worse since the recession. Now I don’t think there is any chance of me getting work. 'It is partly down to the recession but also my age. Companies don’t want to hire anybody in their 40s. All the jobs go to the young up-and-coming jobseekers. 'I’ve got the qualifications but I can’t get the work. As soon as they see how old you are, they don’t want to know. 'It’s against the law to be ageist but in the real world, my world here today, it’s still here and it’s wrong.' Despite all his efforts, Mr Norton has had no job offers - and only a handful of interviews - and he said hitting rock-bottom convinced him to try a new tactic. 'Wearing the sign is a last-ditch attempt for me to get work, a real last resort. I spent a couple of months working up the guts to go down and do it. 'It was not an easy step but things have become that desperate for me. I feel physically sick having to stoop to this but I have no other choice.' It can work! Jason Fruen found a job after advertising his skills on a sandwich board beside the M60 . Mr Norton has set up an email address - hire-me-pleeaase@hotmail.co.uk (sic) - so potential employers can get in touch. Latest statistics show unemployment in the UK now stands at 2.63million, falling by 45,000 in the three months to March this year. Mr Norton is not the first recession-hit jobseeker to try such dramatic measures after struggling to find work. Earlier this month, unemployed Bennett Olson, from Minnesota, put his face on an electric billboard with the words: 'Hire Me!' He shelled out $300 for his face to rotate with other adverts for 24 hours. Last year, frustrated U.S. jobseeker Alisha Madkins, from Boston, walked around the city centre wearing a sandwich board saying 'hire me!' on one side and 'college grad' on the other. But the strategy did work for one lucky Briton, who managed to impress would-be employers with his spirit and dedication. Father-of-one Jason Fruen gained a job in 2009 by standing for four hours at Junction 9 of the M60 in Manchester wearing a sandwich board.","Robin Norton wears a sign reading 'hire me please' and walks up and down the M5 slip-road .

"By . Emma Innes . Scientists believe they have found a possible cure for pancreatic cancer - the disease that Apple CEO Steve Jobs died of . A cure for pancreatic cancer could be on the horizon, according to researchers. Scientists at the University of Cambridge believe they have found a treatment that could eradicate the disease in just one week. Pancreatic cancer has few symptoms in its early stages and so is usually only diagnosed once it is too advanced to be tackled effectively. As a result, it has one of the poorest prognoses of any cancer. Doctors had struggled to defeat the illness using the body's own immune system - a method known as immunotherapy. But researchers have recently discovered that this is because infected cells coat themselves in a ‘chemokine protein’ and form a protective barrier around the tumours. Now, staff at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute have finally made a breakthrough that could one day lead to a cure. A new drug called AMD3100 - also known as Plerixafor - could be used to help block the formation of the protein and break down the cancer's barrier. The body's ‘T cells’ - which attack the cancerous cells - are then able to break through and fight the tumour. Researchers had been testing the drug on mice but now feel it is ready to be tested on humans - with a cure potentially available within the next ten years. Dr Douglas Fearon, from the research institute, has now claimed the breakthrough could be the first step towards a cure for many forms of the disease. He said: ‘We want to get the clinical trial on humans started up as soon as we can as it was so successful on mice. ‘By enabling the body to use its own defences to attack cancer, this approach has the potential to greatly improve treatment of solid tumours. ‘The best possible scenario is that it will cause regression to a large proportion against pancreatic cancer. Experts at the University of Cambridge say the drug they have created could cure the disease (pictured) in just one week - they think it also has the potential to cure other cancers, such as lung and ovarian cancers . ‘And that is not just restricted to pancreatic cancer but would be effective in many forms, including ovarian and lung cancer because they react similarly. ‘This could potentially cure cancer, and save all those lives lost each year to the disease.’ Clinical trials are expected to take place in six months at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death in the UK and the eighth most common worldwide. Tumour removal is the most effective treatment, but it is suitable for just one in five patients. It affects men and women equally, and is most common in people over the age of 60. Fewer than 20 per cent of pancreatic cancer patients are currently still alive a year after diagnosis and less than four per cent survive for five years.","Scientists have found a drug that could eradicate the disease within a week .

"By . Chris Parsons . An additional 1,200 troops will be deployed at the Olympics amid continued concern of the security staffing of beleaguered firm G4S. Ministers today took the decision to call up the 1,200 troops who were on standby last week, as the crisis surrounding G4S deepened just three days before the London 2012 opening ceremony. The military is already plugging the gap left by G4S with 3,500 troops after the security firm admitted two weeks ago it could not provide its 10,400 contracted guards. Drafted in: The military has already plugged the gap left by G4S with 3,500 soldiers after the security firm said it could not provide . its contracted number of Olympic guards. It will now provide another 1,200 men and women . Embattled G4S admitted two weeks ago it would not be able to supply its 10,400 contracted guards for the Olympic venues . Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said, however, the numbers to be provided by the firm 'continue to rise significantly' but that ministers would 'leave nothing to chance'. Ministers took the decision to draft in 1,200 troops this morning at a Cabinet Committee for the Olympics chaired by Prime Minister David Cameron. 'G4S numbers continue to rise significantly and we have every expectation that will continue to be the case. 'However, ministers decided that we should deploy the additional 1,200 troops that were put on standby last week. 'On the eve of the largest peacetime event ever staged in this country, ministers are clear that we should leave nothing to chance. Problems: The army was drafted in because the government could 'leave nothing to chance' following security problems . On patrol: Armed forces patrol the Lee Valley White Water Centre during the Games . New home: Soldiers were temporarily housed in barracks in Tobacco Dock, a former shopping centre in east London, as the government came to terms with the G4S security shortfall . 'The Government continues to have every confidence that we will deliver a safe and secure Games.' Locog chief Paul Deighton insisted the recruitment of more troops was made to 'de-risk any aspect of the operation'. Mr Deighton said: 'With three days to go, we just want to make sure this works without any worries at all.' But he added that it was not a sign of private firm G4S having any further problems supplying staff. A G4S security guard has been charged with theft at a hotel where Olympic footballers are staying. The charge comes just weeks after G4S's humiliating shortfall in providing staff for the Olympics, attracting further unwelcome attention for the security firm. Fassal Mahmood, from Windmill Lane, Smethwick, was yesterday charged with the theft of a mobile phone at Chesford Grange Hotel, near Kenilworth, which is hosting international football teams. The arrest has led to police leaders asking whether the controversial security firm should be stripped of its contract for Olympic football. Warwickshire Police Federation has expressed major concerns after two security guards were arrested at the renamed City of Coventry Stadium last week when officers discovered they were illegal immigrants. Warwickshire Police confirmed the 20-year-old has been bailed and will appear before Leamington magistrates next month. The extra troops come on top of the additional 3,500 drafted in a fortnight ago as the recruitment gap by G4S emerged. Mr Hunt said that, with three days to go until the opening ceremony, London 2012 was 'very much on track'. The Culture Secretary said the additional deployment was not because of any deterioration in the performance of G4S, which had delivered 1,100 more guards yesterday. 'But with three days left to the opening ceremony and an incredibly busy weekend we didn't want to leave anything to chance, and we just decided this was the right measure to take, because for the public the most important thing is a safe and secure Games,' he said. 'It's better to have those troops on the ground so that were they to be needed they can swing into action immediately.' Mr Deighton went on: 'You can't be absolutely certain of anything with a temporary workforce. 'Therefore we want to substitute a temporary workforce with a permanent, reliable workforce that we get with the military.' The chairman of G4S has . admitted the world’s largest security group could lose out on public . sector contracts following the shambles over hiring Olympic guards. G4S . makes more than £1bn of its £7.5bn annual revenues from public sector . work and is currently bidding for nine British prison contracts as well . as services for the police. In a separate blow to G4S, questions were today raised about the ability of trainees manning crucial x-ray machines at Olympic venues. Paying a visit: Mayor of London Boris Johnson visited a police specialist operations room today . Trainees at Olympic security firm G4S are given several chances to pass exams on running vital anti-terrorism x-ray machines, an insider at the company has revealed. Recruits at the beleaguered security company are also given just 20 minutes training on machines designed to stop visitors bringing home-made bombs into Olympic venues. G4S, already embroiled in chaos for its Olympic security failings, will have its reputation tarnished further after an insider at the firm said trainees were able to effectively 'cheat' their way through crucial tests. A source close to the firm told the . Guardian trainees who fail tests are given several chances to correctly . answer the same questions, and are allowed to confer with colleagues . during tests. Worries over . the staffing of x-ray machines were said to have been raised at a . government Cobra meeting, amid more fears that G4S cannot supply the . required numbers to monitor the devices. Military police officers will be deployed alongside regular patrols in central London during the Olympics, it has emerged. The unprecedented decision to use officers from the Royal Military Police (RMP) alongside the Met comes as the capital hosts thousands of soldiers to provide security during the games. Officials are worried the influx of troops in London could spark trouble, especially during rest days and weekends, when they are expected to flood the pubs and bars in the city's West End. The soldiers, who have been deployed at short notice, will have two days off each week and are expected to want to relax in pubs and clubs of central London. RMPs are expected to patrol in their regular British Army camouflage uniform and red berets - a potentially alarming sight for people not used to seeing the military in public places. The move has come about following the G4S fiasco, which has led to the call up of 3,500 troops to step in and police Olympic venues at the last minute. Police and RMPs are understood to have visited pub and bar owners in the Covent Garden area of central London. They have asked bar owners to call a dedicated army hotline if they believe soldiers are involved in trouble, rather than call the police. The Metropolitan police refused to discuss details. G4S . said today it was 'not uncommon' for trainees to repeat tests, before . insisting it had followed industry regulations in designing the exams, . which were approved by Locog. But . despite its assurances, the latest blow to G4S's credibility could lead . to the security company losing several key public sector contracts. Trainees . for the role of 'screener' - those who monitor x-ray images for suspect . contents - are mostly trained on computer simulations, with a small . period set aside for work on the machines themselves. An . insider at the firm told the Guardian that of a recent group undergoing . training at G4S, only five per cent passed first time. One G4S trainee told the Guardian: . 'Those who failed were allowed to retake the exact same modules, . endlessly repeating them until they scraped through. 'You could take the test as many times as you liked before the end of the day at 5pm. 'There . were two invigilators but no attempt was made to stop people cheating. I . don't think the training has properly prepared people for working as . 'screeners' on the x-ray machines.' A . G4S spokesperson today said the repeated tests were 'not uncommon', . and that it encouraged trainees to work through tests 'at their own . pace'. A spokesperson said:'Trainees who . fail the final CBT test by a small margin are given the opportunity to . re-take the marginally-failed section of the test, once only. 'This is done to allow for varied learning pace. 'The . candidates work through practice modules and the subsequent ‘test’ modules at their own pace on their own PC’s with trainers available . should the candidates have any issues. 'We . offer advice and guidance but do not direct the participant in how to . dispose items.  It is not uncommon or wrong to repeat modules. '","Beleaguered firm admitted it cannot provide 10,400 guards for Games .

"By . Associated Press . Credit card receipts, telephone records and production schedules show that X-Men franchise director Bryan Singer was not in Hawaii when a lawsuit claims he sexually abused a 17-year-old on the islands, a defense attorney said Friday. Singer was mainly in Toronto working on the first X-Men movie from August through October 1999, defense attorney Marty Singer told The Associated Press. A lawsuit filed by a former child model, Michael Egan III, says Bryan Singer abused him several times over those three months as well as earlier in California as part of a Hollywood sex ring led by another man convicted of luring minors across state lines for sex. Accused: A man who claims he was sexually abused by the X-Men franchise director Bryan Singer said Thursday, April 17, 2014, that he reported the molestation to authorities at the time, and does not know why charges were never pursued . 'This was Bryan's first studio film,' Marty Singer said. 'Clearly, he's not going to take a break in the middle of this movie while you're shooting and prepping it to go to Hawaii.' Egan's lawyer, Jeff Herman, did not immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment. Egan said Thursday that he was abused by Bryan Singer and others starting when he was 15. He said he was given drugs and promises of a Hollywood career while being threatened and sexually abused in Los Angeles and Hawaii. The AP does not typically name victims of sex abuse but is naming Egan because he is speaking publicly about his allegations. Marty Singer, who said previously that he and the director are not related, declined to provide any of the personal records, saying they were private.

Singer has directed three films in the . blockbuster franchise, including the fifth installment, X-Men: Days of . Future Past, to be released next month, as well as other films . including The Usual Suspects. His . lawyer said the director was never interviewed by any authorities about . the claims by Egan, who said Thursday he reported the Los Angeles acts . and doesn't know why charges were not pursued. The . lawsuit was filed under a Hawaii law that temporarily suspends the . statute of limitations in sex abuse cases. The law has led to several . lawsuits against clergy members and others. A judge in Hawaii set a July 21 scheduling hearing in Honolulu for the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday.","An attorney for Bryan Singer says he was in Hawaii when he is alleged to have sexually abused a teenage boy there .

"By . Martin Robinson . As Britain celebrated the beginning of 2014, pictures taken of last night's New Year's Eve revelry reveal many will have woken with a very sore head this morning and some may even have slept in a police cell or a hospital bed. From Swansea to Manchester, Birmingham to London, and Liverpool to Newcastle, partygoers were drunk and dishevelled as they spilled out of bars, clubs and parties and onto the streets last night. As usual, while the majority enjoyed an evening with friends and loved-ones, the drunken minority were unable to control themselves after taking the opportunity to let their hair down. And in some instances they ended up on the wrong side of the law, with Scotland Yard revealing that 100 people were arrested for drunken, violent or sexual crimes during the celebrations in central London. Meanwhile Ambulance trusts said they received one phone call every 15 seconds last night as they dealt with the results of excessive drinking. Scroll down for video .

Officers made 39 arrests for drunk and disorderly behaviour and 21 for assault, with others arrested for drugs offences, affray, sexual offences, theft and carrying an offensive weapon. Chief Inspector Robyn Williams said: 'Visitors were not put off by the threat of wind and rain and the viewing areas filled up quicker than ever before. 'Officers worked hard, alongside stewards, to keep people safe during the event and ensure that everyone who came into central London was able to make their way home at the end of the night. 'Crowds were good natured and there were no major issues reported to police.' The force had 3,800 officers on duty . for fireworks alone, while London Ambulance Service received 1,100 calls . between 7pm and midnight, and 469 in the first hour of 2014. Devon and Cornwall Police said they made nearly 120 arrests on New Year's Eve - with one standing out. Custody Sergeant Howard Brugge based in Torquay said: 'How to get arrested on New Year's Eve - crash into a police car while drunk.' He said there were 21 people in custody at Torquay, Devon, which was 'not too bad for New Year's Eve'. Around the force area there were a total of 199 people detained for various offences.

One of the group called 999 and spoke to Falmouth Coastguard who immediately sought help from Coastguard Rescue Teams at Penzance, Porthleven, Mullion and Porthoustock, RNLI lifeboats from Penlee and Lizard and a rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose. The coastguard rescue teams, lifeboats and helicopter searched in atrocious weather conditions but were unable to find any sign of the missing person. By 4.30am they had covered the search area many times over but were unable to find the person. Filthy work: More than 250,000 people turned out to watch the fireworks in central London but the result was piles and piles of mess, including here on Parliament Square . In front of the Eye: At the spot where many watched the fireworks street cleaners and rubbish collectors take part in a huge operation to clean up the streets of central London following New Year's Eve celebrations . Starting afresh: Council workers have already started clearing the mess from the streets of central London this morning as many dumped bottles and rubbish . The search was suspended until first light when the coastguard teams began another search. Phil Mathias, Falmouth Coastguard watch manager, said: 'The weather for searching has been particularly challenging and as the night has gone on, conditions have deteriorated. 'There have been south to south westerly gale force to severe gale force winds with very rough sea and rain. 'The teams have conducted a very intensive search for the missing person. 'We have been able to focus our efforts into a relatively tight area because of onshore winds but have still been unable to locate the missing person.'","Scotland Yard makes 100 arrests over night, including for sexual assault, affray and drunk and disorderly behaviour .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Australian scientists have developed a pen that enables them to create new bone tissues. When bones are broken in accidents or . following amputations, the tissue inside them is also damaged, making it . difficult to build new, fully functioning implants. To solve this problem, a team of Australian researchers have created a handheld 3D printer called the BioPen which not only adds layers of tissue cells to damaged bones, but combines with existing nerves and muscles. Scroll down for video . The BioPen prototype, pictured, was designed and built using 3D printing equipment in the labs at the University of Wollongong. It works in a similar way to a 3D printer by building layers of cells and alginate, or seaweed extract, before covering them in a protective gel . The device works in a similar way to a 3D . printer by building layers of material. It mixes cells with alginate, or seaweed extract, before . covering them in a protective gel. The two layers of the material . are mixed together in the tip of the BioPen and surgeons can use the . mixture to ‘draw’ or ‘fill in’ damaged sections of bones. As the . mixture is drawn onto the bones, an ultraviolet light dries it so the . surgeon can create layers of cells, or as the researchers call it, ‘bone . scaffolding.’ The cells will then multiply, and eventually join the cells of tissue, including nerves or muscles. It means surgeons can design customised implants during surgery, rather than waiting weeks to grow replacement tissue. The BioPen technology could additionally cut recovery times and increase the chances of surgery success because the cells combine with the patient’s existing tissue to prevent rejection. The device can also be used with other drugs to increase regrowth and recovery. The BioPen prototype was designed and built at the University of Wollongong and was recently given to clinical partners at St Vincent’s Hospital Melbourne.

The team at Wollongong University previously grew new knee cartilage from stem cells on 3D-printed scaffolds that could be used to treat cancers and osteoarthritis. According to the researchers, the BioPen will ‘give surgeons greater control over where the materials are deposited while also reducing the time the patient is in surgery by delivering live cells and growth factors directly to the site of injury, accelerating the regeneration of functional bone and cartilage.’ The BioPen was recently given to clinical partners at St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne.

"By . Alex Greig . Police are searching for a woman who allegedly tried to abduct a baby in a stroller from his nanny in Manhattan Thursday afternoon. The NYPD has identified the woman as Tara Anne McDonald, 46, who has several prior arrests for similar crimes. Police say the nanny was pushing the eight-month-old baby boy in a stroller down Eighth Avenue near 17th Street in the Chelsea neighborhood when she was approached by McDonald. Suspect: Police released this mugshot of Tara Anne McDonald, 46, who is suspected of attempting to kidnap an eight-month-old baby boy from his nanny . McDonald reportedly began mumbling at the nanny and then tried to pull the stroller away from her. McDOnald acted as though the baby was hers, witnesses said, screaming and yelling at the nanny to give her the baby. Identified: The nanny helped police create this sketch of suspect who was later identified as Tara McDonald . A UPS driver, William Marte, witnessed the ensuing struggle and ran to the aid of the nanny. 'She grabbed the stroller by the handle, and without no reason, starts saying ""Give me my baby,""' Marte told ABC. 'I told the lady, ""Leave her alone, get off, are you out of your mind?""' McDonald eventually fled the scene, disappearing south on Eighth Avenue. The baby, said Marte, was unhurt in the struggle and slept through the entire ordeal. Police have released a photograph of the suspect and say she has 12 prior arrests for similar crimes. She served more than a year in prison for an attempted kidnapping in 1998. Other charges include five attempted kidnappings, two actual kidnappings, robbery, disorderly conduct, felony asault, petit larceny and DWI, reports CBS. On Friday afternoon, police distributed flyers of McDonald's mugshot around Chelsea. Search: Police are canvassing the area where McDonald is accused of trying to snatch a baby boy . Some locals recognized her from the shot. 'She's a local crazy. I seen her on the corner here a couple of times, not recently but maybe a month ago,' Chelsea worker Yancy Matson told ABC. Tara Anne McDonald is described as about five-foot eight-inches tall with salt-and-pepper hair. She was wearing blue jeans and a beige hat and coat.","Police are circulating a mugshot of a woman suspected in an attempted kidnapping .

"By . Rob Waugh . Last stand: The coins were buried by Christian soldiers of the order of the Knights Hospitalier as the Crusaders faced an unstoppable attack by a huge Muslim army . A pot of gold from the Crusades worth up to $500,000 has been found buried in an ancient Roman fortress in Israel. The coins were buried by Christian soldiers of the order of the Knights Hospitalier as the Crusaders faced an unstoppable attack by a huge Muslim army. The knights were annihilated in April 1265. The coins - worth a fortune even in 1265 when they were thought to have been buried - were deliberately hidden inside a broken jug to prevent them being discovered. The fortress was destroyed in April 1265 by forces of Mamluks who overwhelmed the Crusaders - and the treasure only survived due to the quick thinking of one of the defenders. 'It was in a small juglet, and it was partly broken,' Oren Tal of the University of Tel Aviv told Fox News. 'The idea was to put something broken in the ground and fill it with sand, in order to hide the gold coins within. If by chance somebody were to find the juglet, he won’t excavate it, he won’t look inside it to find the gold coins. Once we started to sift it, the gold came out.' The Roman fortress in Apollonia National Park has yielded a huge number of archaeological treasures - but scientists excavating layer from the thirteenth century were stunned to unearth a literal pot of gold. The clay container had more than 100 gold dinals from the time when the Crusaders occupied the fortress, originally built by the Romans. The coins discovered in the fort date to the Fatimid empire in northern Africa, and are 200-300 years older than the ruined fortress they found in. The coins were minted in Tripoli and Alexandria - and are extremely valuable. Scroll down for video . Buried treasure: The coins - worth a fortune even in 1265 when they were thought to have been buried - were deliberately hidden inside a broken jug to prevent them being discovered . The ruined Crusader fortress offers a unique insight into the lives - and deaths - of the Knights Hospitalier . Orlando Bloom portrays a Crusader in Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven . The Knights Hospitaller - also known as the Knights of St John - . arose as a group of individuals associated with the work of an Amalfitan . hospital in the Muristan district of Jerusalem . The hospital was founded around 1023 by Blessed Gerard to provide care pilgrims to the Holy Land. However the order was soon extended into providing an armed escort to pilgrims. After . the Western Christian conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 during the First . Crusade, the organisation became a religious and military order under . its own charter, and was charged with the care and defence of the Holy . Land. By the mid-12th century, the order was divided into military brothers and those who worked with the sick. 'Fatimid coins are very difficult to study,' says Oren Tal, 'The letters are sometimes very difficult to decipher.' The coins can sell for up to $5,000 apiece, according to Israel's Haaretz newspaper. The excavations are offering a unique insight into Crusader fortifications in the Middle East. The layer of Crusader artifacts has lain nearly undisturbed since 1265. Muslim Arsuf was conquered by the Crusaders in 1101 and re-conquered by the Mamluks in 1265. The presence of the Crusaders left its mark on the town. Large parts of it were re-planned, while extensive fortifications, private and public buildings, as well as a castle were erected. The town’s abandonment . after its Mamluk destruction led to a unique archaeological setting in . which the Crusader layers were left largely undisturbed by later . settlement activities. The remains of the old crusader fort of Apolonia. New investigations of the 13th century layers have thrown up hidden treasures . The Crusades were a series of religious wars with the stated goal of restoring Christian access to the holy places in and near Jerusalem - a sacred city for Jews, Christians and Muslims. Events leading up to the Crusades began in 1071 when the Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantine army. The Byzantine emperor then called on fellow Christian leaders and the Pope to come to the aid of Constantinople and free Jerusalem from 372 years of Muslim rule. Many answered the call, angered by the destruction of many Christian sacred sites and the persecution of Christians under the Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim. Under Al-Hakim in the early 11th . century, thousands of churches were destroyed throughout the ancient . Christian heartland of the Middle East, and when the Seljuk Turks . captured Jerusalem in 1077, just 22 years before it fell to the . Crusaders, they too massacred some three thousand inhabitants. All these Islamic attacks on the West . occurred before the First Crusade. Some scholars even argue that the . very idea of 'holy war' was learned from the example of Islam on the . march. All these events led to the main series of Crusades, primarily against Muslims in the Levant, occurred between 1095 and 1291, producing some of the bloodiest conflicts in history. Raymond of Agiles described the capture of Jerusalem by the Crusaders in 1099 thus: . 'Some of our men cut off the heads of their enemies; others shot them with arrows, so that they fell from the towers; others tortured them longer by casting them into the flames. Piles of heads, hands and feet were to be seen in the streets of the city. It was necessary to pick one's way over the bodies of men and horses. But these were small matters compared to what happened at the temple of Solomon, a place where religious services ware ordinarily chanted. What happened there? If I tell the truth, it will exceed your powers of belief. So let it suffice to say this much at least, that in the temple and portico of Solomon, men rode in blood up to their knees and bridle reins.' The First Crusade (1095-1101)Crusader armies defeated two substantial Turkish forces at Dorylaeum and at Antioch, reaching Jerusalem with only a fraction of their original forces. In 1099, they took Jerusalem by assault and created small crusader states, which became the ‘Kingdom of Jerusalem’.The Second Crusade (1147-49)After a period of relative peace in which Christians and Muslims co-existed in the Holy Land, Muslims conquered the town of Edessa. A new crusade was called for by various preachers. French and German armies marched to Jerusalem in 1147 but failed to accomplish any major successes.The Third Crusade (1187-92) in 1187, Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt captured Jerusalem. Pope Gregory VIII called for a crusade which was undertaken by King Richard I of England (Richard the Lionheart), Holy Roman Emporer Frederick I, and King Philip II of France. They defeated the Muslims near Arsuf but failed to take of Jerusalem. Richard left the following year after establishing a truce with Saladin.The Fourth Crusade (1202-04)The Fourth Crusade was initiated in 1202 by Pope Innocent III, with the intention of invading the Holy Land through Egypt. Because they subsequently lacked provisions and time on their vessel lease the leaders decided to go to Constantinople, where they attempted to place a Byzantine exile on the throne, before sacking the city .The Fifth Crusade (1217-21) The  Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215) formulated a plan for the recovery of the Holy Land. A crusading force from Hungary and Austria took back. In the second phase, crusader forces attacked Cairo. Flooding in the Nile forced them to choose between surrender and defeat.The Sixth Crusade (1228-29, 1239) Through diplomacy by Emperor Frederick II Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Bethlehem were delivered to the Crusaders for a period of ten years. This was the first Crusade that had no Papal involvement.The Seventh Crusade (1249-52) Fought in Egypt, the crusaders lost a decisive battle at La Forbie in Gaza. This battle is considered by many historians to have been the death knell to the Christian States.The Eighth Crusade (1270)Organised by Louis IX in 1270 to come to the aid of the remnants of the Crusader states in Syria. However, the Crusade was diverted to Tunis, where Louis spent only two months before dying. The crusade achieved a partial success in that Christian religious were allowed to live peacefully in the region.","Pot of gold 'Dinals' were buried by Crusaders as enemy forces closed in .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . Sheila Heacock, 44, was arrested yesterday for allegedly having sex with on of her male 16-year-old students . A female high school teacher, 44, from Yucaipa California was arrested Yesterday after sheriffs received a tip from a school administartor that she may be engaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with her 16-year-old male student. The alleged abuse began in January 2014 and the most recent incident occurred in March. Yucaipa's sheriff Station and detectives from the Crimes Against Children Detail contacted the 16-year-old who told of the sexual relationship between he and his teacher Sheila Heacok at Yucaipa High School. News Mirror reports that Heacock could face charges of unlawful sexual intercourse, oral copulation with a minor, penetration by foreign object, and unlawful communication with a minor. The alleged incidents took place at a remote location near the intersection of Butterfly Drive and Wildwood canyon Road about 10 miles from the school, said Cindy Bachman, a spokesperson for the sheriff's department. The L.A. Times reports that the incidents never occurred on school grounds, at the victims home, nor did they occur at the teacher's home. Heacock was booked at the Central Detention Center and is being held at $100,000 bail. She will be arraigned this coming Tuesday in San Bernadino Superior Court. Heacock has been employed as a Spanish teacher at Yucaipa High School for three years . Heacock has been a teacher with the Yucaipa/Calimesa school district for 18 years and worked at Yucaipa high school for three years. It is unknown whether this is the first sexual relationship the teacher has had with one of her students or with an underage party. 'There’s always a possibility when someone has daily contact with minors that there may have been some other unlawful behavior,' Bachman said, 'and in this case, the suspect has been a teacher for 18 years.' Heacock is currently on paid administrative leave as that is the protocol and the school is cooperating with investigators. 'Of course our very first concern is about the safety and well-being of our children,'said Cali Binks, superintendent of the Yucaipa-Calimesa Joint Unified School District. 'We take these matters very seriously, and our heart goes out to the families of all parties involved.'

"Authorities say a child's body found off a highway in central Massachusetts on Friday matches the height and weight of a missing 5-year-old boy who has been missing for seven months. Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said the body has not been positively identified as Jeremiah Oliver, of Fitchburg, and that won't happen until after an autopsy by the state medical examiner. 'It appears to be a homicide,' he said at a news conference. Found dead: A body recovered near a wooded area in Massachusetts on Friday morning is believed to be missing five-year-old Fitchburg boy Jeremiah Oliver. Tests: Massachusetts State Police stand along Interstate 190 where police said a child's body was found near Sterling . Early said the body was found at about 9 a.m. by a police search team about 40 feet off U.S. Highway 190 near Sterling, which is about 12 miles from Fitchburg. He said it was wrapped in blanket-like material, and packed in material that resembled a suitcase. He would not say what led authorities to the location, or how long the body may have been there. He said the site is near an area that is regularly mowed on the side of the highway but would not have been visible to passing cars. The main suspects: Elsa Oliver (left), 28, and Alberto Sierra (right), 22, have been charged with multiple counts related to the young boy's disappearance . Jeremiah was last seen by relatives in September but wasn't reported missing until December. Authorities have said they feared he was dead. The family was being monitored by state social workers at the time, and the case led to scrutiny of the state Department of Children and families. Jeremiah's mother, Elsa Oliver, pleaded not guilty in March to charges including kidnapping, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and reckless endangerment. Her boyfriend pleaded not guilty to similar charges. They have been held since December on lesser charges in the case. The heartbreaking tale has been months in the making, as Jeremiah was reported missing in December when his sister told someone at her school that she and her siblings were being abused. Unusual behavior: Elsa Oliver, seen here in December, began acting strangely and refused to speak to even her own lawyer . Emotionless: Elsa Oliver reportedly spoke to a relative recently and randomly interjected asking 'Is it the Rapture?' The girl said that the last time they saw Jeremiah- which is said to be on September 14- his hand was bleeding and for unexplained reasons, his mother Elsa was reportedly worried that he would die as a result of the hand wound. Elsa Oliver and her boyfriend Alberto Sierra, 22, were first brought into court in December. Both Elsa Oliver and Alberto Sierra face multiple charges, including assault with a dangerous weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. During the initial investigation a strange clue was offered when it was found that Elsa had a tattoo with a butterfly and the date 'Sept. 25, 2013' written below it. Police have spoken to local tattoo artists because they want to know whether she told a tattoo artist why that date is significant. Missing: The search had been going on since December although young Jeremiah Oliver has not been seen since September . It is not clear why it took three months for authorities to be notified of Jeremiah's disappearance, but an anonymous tip led them to believe that the mother's boyfriend may have had something to do with the alleged abuse. The source said Sierra, 22, would bully and intimidate those around him, routinely becoming irate and even making death threats on more than one occasion. Both Elsa Oliver and Alberto Sierra face multiple charges, including assault with a dangerous weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.","Jeremiah Olicer was last seen on September 14 but authorities weren't notified until December when his sister complained of being abused .

"By . Louise Boyle . A wealthy restaurateur has revealed his fears that his elderly heiress wife has been duped by her  personal trainer and long-time assistant in an attempt to steal her fortune. Athanasios Konidaris, 71, claims that his wife Shelley Upsher Konidaris, 83, has been taken in by her 'Romeo' personal trainer Rex Hughes. Mrs Konidaris, 83, is one of two heirs to the multimillion-dollar diaper-rash creme Desitin fortune. Her wealth is estimated between $2 and $100million, according to varying lawyers. Athanasios Konidaris, pictured with his wife Shelley, fears that she is being duped out of her family fortune by a personal trainer . Mrs Konidaris decided to begin working out in an effort to look younger, according to court documents filed in Montgomery County Court, philly.com reported. She began working out with Rex Hughes who her husband claims charged the 83-year-old around $12,000 for just a few workout sessions. When Mr Konidaris complained, he said that his wife froze him out, changed the locks on their home, asked for a divorce and got a court protection order. The couple have been married for 25 years, living together in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. The couple have ran Zesty's Greek restaurant in Manayunk for two decades. The restaurant owner claimed that his wife is being duped by Hughes and her 'family office administrator' Beverly Ben-Lulu. Mr Konidaris claims that his wife is being hoodwinked by Rex Hughes (pictured), a personal trainer who is helping her recapture her youth . Shelley Upsher Konidaris (pictured in her youth) has been working with a personal trainer which her husband claims has led to her kicking him out of the home and filing for divorce .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Portland teen who made headlines this week for allegedly urinating in a city reservoir - which prompted officials to flush the more than 38 million gallons of supposedly tainted water - has one thing to say: 'I didn't piss in the f***ing water.' Dallas Swonger, 18, has landed in hot water after surveillance footage shows him urinating near the city-owned reservoir early Wednesday morning. Swonger admits to urinating near the reservoir, but claims that he did it on a fence next to it, and that none of the urine found its way into the city water supply. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This image of Dallas Swonger apparently urinating in the reservoir contradicts his claim that he 'didn't piss in the f***ing water' 38 million gallons: Swonger's urine prompted water officials in Portland to dump 38 million gallons of water . 'Everybody thinks it’s funny and a joke and I’m going to be on the . news,' Swonger said in an exclusive interview with the website vocative.com. 'It’s no . f***in’ joke, dude. I don’t want people thinkin’ that Dallas is a dumb . ass because he pissed in the f***in’ water. In our drinking water. Yeah, . that’s f***ing awesome. I mean, wouldn’t you be pissed about that?' The night Swonger admittedly urinated in the city's water supply, he and a few friends were skateboarding in Mount Tabor Park at about 1 a.m. - after the park had closed for the night. Swonger and his friends can be seen standing by the reservoir in the park. After talking for a few minutes, the three men can be seen walking away from the reservoir. That, apparently, was when nature called. 'I was like, ""Dudes I have to piss so bad,’” Swonger explaine. 'So I just went over to the wall [of the reservoir]. 'I leaned up against the wall and pissed on it - right there on the wall, dude. I don’t know else how to describe it.' Not a 'dumbass': Spronger doesn't want people to think he's a 'dumbass' for allegedly peeing in the reservoir . Officials from the city's Water Bureau aren't buying Swonger's claim that he urinated on the fence, and not in the reservoir. 'When you see the video, he’s leaning right up because he has to get his . little wee wee right up to the iron bars,' bureau administrator Davd . Shaff told the Oregonian. 'There’s really no doubt what he’s doing.' Officials tested the water on Thursday and it showed no signs of contamination - and, as Swonger points out, animals urinate and defecate in the reservoir all the time and they don't drain the entire reservoir. Regardless, officials will dump a 'conservative' estimate of 38 million gallons of water - all as cities and states on the West Coast are suffering serious droughts. 'Contaminated': In 2011, water officials dumped another 7 million gallons of water after a man urinated in the reservoir . Cited: Spronger and his friends were each cited for tresspassing - but he was hit with an additional charge of public urination . 'Like, how they can do that?' says Swonger. 'How can they be like, ""Yeah, we’re gonna flush all that water."" Dude, I’ve seen dead birds in . there. During the summer time I’ve see hella dead animals in there. Like . dead squirrels and s**t. I mean, really, dude?' Swonger and his two friends - identified as Trey McDaniel and Daniel McDonald - were stopped by park officials shortly after Swonger allegedly urinated in the reservoir and cited for trespassing. Swonger was hit with an additional citation for public urination - and the Water Bureau says it plans to push for additional charges against the 18-year-old high school grad. Swonger isn't the first Oregonian to drop trou and relieve himself in the reservoir. In 2011, the city dumped 7.8 million gallons of water from the reservoir after another man urinated in it. According to his buddy McDonald, Swonger is not handling the negative attention he's received in the media very well. 'Dallas is really bummed out about all of it,' McDonald told Vocative.com. 'He’s a really good guy . at heart. He just doesn’t make the best decisions. Honestly, he has the . potential to do really good.'","Dallas Swonger, 18, claims he urinated on the fence next to the reservoir .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Secret Service agents in Bill Clinton's White House angered a black congressman in 1993 after forcing him to show his ID and searching his car before allowing him to attend a meeting with then-Vice President Al Gore. A white driver taking Ohio Democratic Rep. Louis Stokes to his meeting was admitted without an ID-check. A staffer's memo to Clinton a week later warned the president about the incident before a scheduled photo-op including Stokes and the mayor of a Cleveland suburb. President Bill Clinton (R) leaned on Rep. Louis Stokes (L) to use his leverage with the Congressional Black Caucus during legislative fights. But in 1993 Stokes couldn't get in the White House without an ID check and a car search . Stokes (C, seated), was a civil rights icon in Ohio and served on the House Assassinations Committee that investigated the killing of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The memo from a senior aide described Rep. Stokes' disgust at being subjected to what he thought was racial profiling . Stokes, a legend in the civil-rights history of Ohio's populous Cuyahoga County, was beside himself. Rep. Stokes . was asked for identification, although his white driver was not,' Susan Brophy, then White House deputy director of legislative affairs, wrote to Clinton. 'Furthermore, before Rep. Stokes was allowed in the gate, a K-9 detail . searched his car. Rep. Stokes is understandably furious and believes the . search to be racially motivated.' Stokes, she wrote, had used his position as an appropriations subcommittee chairman to be 'very helpful to the Administration.' 'For your information, Howard Paster has spoken at length with David Watkins about the incident. David has taken steps to insure that in the future Members of Congress driving ,into the White House will be admitted expeditiously and will be treated with respect.' Watkins, then White House director of administration, was fired a year later for using a presidential helicopter to ferry himself and friends to a Maryland golf outing. Bill Clinton's political second act has been marred by revelations in his administration's archives, which were set for release a year ago but delayed by archivists. Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, went on to become a US senator and secretary of state -- and is now mulling her own White House run . Stokes (L) stood alongside Clinton in 1998 when he signed a law directing the National Park Service to spend $500,000 per year to connect sites along the old Underground Railroad, a secret system used by black slaves to escape the South in the years before the US Civil War . An earlier set of Clinton White House documents released on March 1 included a note to the president from aide Chris Jennings, who explained that Stokes was 'the key to the Congressional Black Caucus' if then-first lady Hillary Clinton's health care overhaul were to become law. Image problem: Vice President Al Gore got so little public praise from President Clinton that his staffers started begging for it . 'It's important that he hear from you,' Jennings wrote. 'I am convinced, though, that such ""stroking"" will pay dividends.' Jennings recently left the White House after a second tour of service, where he was President Barack Obama's behind-the-scenes point man on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The more than 7,500 pages released Friday sparked the fourth media feeding frenzy since the first batch went online on February 28. The latest collection saw Vice President Al Gore's staff practically begging Clinton to say positive things about their boss in public toward the end of his administration. 'I am trying to knock down the idea that the Clinton White House’s support for Gore is based on legacy notions,' one Gore aide wrote his West Wing counterpart, 'and build up the idea that it is based on respect, relationships and in-the-foxhole camaraderie.' 'Also, some kind words about his very competent staff are always welcome.' Gore's handlers, already looking ahead to a 2000 election race that the VP would lose, were desperate for a presidential hat-tip to 'Gore as one of the guys' – a wink of approval that 'rebuts the charge that Gore lacks a Clinton type of feel for political rhetoric.' Meanwhile, the document cache sheds some light on how Mrs. Clinton, who now faces a possible presidential run of her own, was worrying White House aides because of a significant image problem. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton wound up 'getting real' in a different way after her husband's infidelities were exposed, but initially her handlers wanted the public to see a softer side of the future senator . While she came to Washington with sky-high favorability numbers, the undated memo remarks on how those metrics turned south. 'Obviously, this is partly the handiwork of the radical right and the radio talk show hosts who have much to gain by painting an unflattering portrait of you,' it reads. '[S]ome Americans can’t handle smart, tough, independent women. And that’s the image most Americans have of you.' While the first lady's close acquaintances know her as a warm and caring person with an everywoman streak, the memo advised, 'the public doesn’t know it' unless she engages in some publicity stunts to 'get real.' The suggested solution was to showcase her in a series of public appearances carefully calibrated to make her seem more ordinary – including 'shopping frantically for Christmas presents, caroling (maybe with Chelsea and some of her friends) during the holiday season, working out, [or] making scrambled eggs for Sunday brunch.'","Louis Stokes was a Cleveland, Ohio lawmaker and the 'key to the Congressional Black Caucus'

"By . Alex Greig . The president of a Seattle university has come under fire from conservatives for asking students how to make the campus less white. In a controversial questionnaire making the rounds of Western Washington University, President Bruce Shephard asked students, 'How do we make sure that in future years we are not as white as we are today?' Shephard has been vocal about his goal of creating a more diverse faculty and student body since he took office six years ago. Hard questions: Western Washington University's Bruce Shephard is asking staff and students how to attract students from a more diverse range of backgrounds . In the university's opening convocation in 2012, he said: 'Every year, from this stage and at this time, you have heard me say that, if in decades ahead, we are as white as we are today, we will have failed as university.' Despite backlash from conservative pundits, Shephard is unapologetic about his stance. 'I needed to provoke attention to the changing demography of our state, and when you use words like ""white,"" that does get people's attention,' he told CBS. In a recent blog post, Shephard clarified his position. 'High . school graduation numbers in our state are flat and are projected to . remain so. Within those flat graduation numbers, the percentage coming . from families from diverse ethnic and racial groups where parents have . not gone to college is rapidly increasing,' he wrote. All white now: The university has traditionally drawn white students from upper middle class backgrounds, a group that is diminishing . Support: Faculty and students have been supportive of Shephard's diversity goals . The . aim, he wrote, is not to keep white students out, it's to attract more . students from other backgrounds that reflect the state's changing . demography. The pool from which the university traditionally draws its . students is getting smaller - meaning that to survive, the school needs . to diversify. 'It is . about whether we will have the wisdom, the culture, the commitment, to . be able to attract a sufficient number of students from diverse . backgrounds,' he wrote. 'In . the decades ahead, should we be as white as we are today, we will be . relentlessly driven toward mediocrity; or, become a sad shadow of our . current self.' Shephard . has incurred the wrath of sites such as Campus Reform, a self-styled . 'campus watchdog' for conservative students, which cast Shephard's goal . of racial diversity as an attempt to discourage white students from . attending the school. 'I think he's being very insensitive to how people are perceived based on the color of their skin,' said editor-in-chief Caleb Bonham. Unapologetic: Shephard says that his choice of words was intended to fuel discussion . A Twitter response stated 'Dear Sir: You need to resign immediately!  Your white mediocrity is a stain to the fabric of WWU.  Usher in the future. Defund WWU.' Shephard said his wording was designed to provoke a response. 'Understanding requires conversations on  our campus that are wide and . deep, thoughtful and informed.  And, if being provocative helps . stimulate  those conversations well, then, guess I am merely doing my . job,' he wrote on the blog. Only about 20 per cent of Western Washington University's 15,000 students come from minority backgrounds. Shephard says he has received many messages of support from staff and students, but he has increased security from campus police following threats. Early Wednesday evening, Shepard and WWU student body president Carly Roberts responded to critics. 'We will not waste a moment’s time responding to extremist media and the hate mongers they pander to. We believe that difficult questions must be answered thoughtfully and deliberately,' they said, reports Seattle PI. Racial background is not a factor in admissions at Western Washington University.","Western Washington University President Bruce Shephard circulated a questionnaire to students and staff asking how to make the campus 'not as white'

"By . Snejana Farberov . A 27-year-old Kansas City-area man has being identified as the alleged gunman in a dozen recent highway shootings that have wounded three people. Jackson County prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said at a news conference Friday that Mohammed Pedro Whitaker, of Grandview, has been charged with 18 felony counts and is being held on $1million cash bail. Baker said Whitaker was charged with two counts of shooting into a motor vehicle and injuring a person, seven counts of shooting into a motor vehicle and nine counts of armed criminal action. Scroll down for video . Caught: Mohammed Whitaker, 27, of Grandview, Missouri,  has been charged with 18 felony counts in connection with about a dozen recent highway shootings that have wounded three people . Evidence: Police confiscated Whitaker's dark green Dodge Neon registered to his father . At least six of the shootings occurred near Grandview. The Kansas City suburb is home to an area known as the Grandview Triangle, where three interstates and U.S. 50 intersect. Other shootings were reported in the Missouri suburbs of Blue Springs and Lee's Summit and Leawood, Kansas. Two of the wounded drivers were shot in the leg, and the third was struck in the arm. None of their injuries was considered life-threatening. The last confirmed shooting believed to be connected to Whitaker was reported April 6, about a month after the spree began. ‘I'm so pleased tonight might be a night to sleep. It's been so many nights without that for us,’ said Baker. Whitaker was taken into custody Thursday at a home near Interstate 49, one of the highways that intersects at the Grandview Triangle. Some 30 police officers who swarmed the dwelling also confiscated a dark green Dodge Neon. The license plates on the car were registered to the suspect's father, who was stunned by the allegations made against his son. Underachiever: Whitaker dropped out of a technical college and was working for a medical supply company . Blindsided: His father said he had no idea his son could even fire a gun . ‘I thought everything was okay with him,’ his father told Kansas City Star. ‘I just thought he was working and trying to pay off his college bills.’ According to the father, his son Mohammed called him April 7 - a day after the last reported shooting - asking him for money to tie him over until his payday. He sent him $50. The 27-year-old, who had dropped out of a technical college, worked for the medical supply company OptumRx affiliated with UnitedHealth Group in Overland Park. His father said he had heard of the shooting spree but never thought his son was behind it. ‘To my knowledge, he’s never fired a gun,’ said the dad. ‘I’m totally shocked by all this.’ Investigators have yet to find a motive. It is believed that Whitaker acted alone. Police began noticing a pattern about two weeks ago after receiving reports of apparently random shootings at vehicles. Earlier this month, investigators were looking into about 20 reports of shootings, but that number has fluctuated. Late last week, police said they had connected a dozen shootings to the same person, but they have said little else about how the incidents were linked or what kind of vehicle the suspect drove. Police did not say what led them to the suspect. The station 41 Action News reported that on April 11, officers acting on a tip watched as Whitaker tried to buy a .380 handgun equipped with laser sight in a parking lot. On Wednesday, the suspect was spotted driving erratically to catch up with another car. A reward of up to $10,000 was offered for information leading to an arrest. Police haven't said if anyone will be claiming the reward money. An unnamed suspect has been taken into custody in connection with a string of random highway shootings that left three people wounded in the Kansas City, Missouri, area. Investigators have looked into as many as 20 reported highway shootings as part of their investigation. One woman said she was driving down the road with her three-year-old child when a figure in a ski-mask driving beside her opened fire, narrowly missing the youngster. Witness Tom McFarlane told KMBC-TV: 'I . was just driving down the highway and heard a loud noise. Something hit . the car, didn't know what it was, so I pulled over at my first . opportunity to kind of see if there was any damage and that's when I saw . the bullet hole.' One witness claimed the shooter was wearing a ski-mask and just missed her three-year-old child who also in the car . Kansas City Police and the FBI had been offering a $7,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the unidentified suspect . Most of the shootings were reported in an area in the southern part of Kansas City known as the Grandview Triangle where three interstate highways and U.S. 50 intersect. Local police called in help from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. A $10,000 reward had been offered for information leading to the capture of the attacker. The first incident was reported to police on March 8. Luckily, no one was killed but two victims have been hit in the legs and a third received a gunshot wound to the arm. Ginny Bauer said she was driving a friend home when she was hit by a bullet. 'There wasn't another car in sight and we were in the right lane and hit on the right side,"" she said .

"Yahoo’s recently fired chief operating officer has received a final severance package of $58million after only working at the internet company for 15 months. A new regulatory filing released Wednesday revealed the eight-figure payout that Henrique de Castro was given by his former boss, Marissa Mayer, after she both hired and fired him in just over a year. Mayer dumped de Castro, who was in charge of ad sales, in January after concluding he wasn't executing on her plan for reviving Yahoo's lackluster ad growth. Scroll down for video . Payday: Regulatory filings revealed that Henrique de Castro has received  $58million in compensation after working at Yahoo for only 15 months (pictured in January 2013) 'Ultimately, Henrique was not a fit and that's a very regrettable conclusion,' Mayer told analysts in late January. 'And it's a conclusion that we tried very hard to avoid, but it was the right decision in the end for the company.' After making the expensive mistake, Mayer has said she won't pick another chief operating officer. De Castro's severance pay more than doubled the amount that Yahoo paid Mayer last year. Mayer's compensation was valued at $24.9million, a 32 per cent decline from the previous year. The decrease stemmed primarily from a stock award of $35million that she received in July 2012 when Yahoo persuaded her to leave her previous job as a top Google Inc. executive to become its CEO. Yahoo's stock has nearly tripled in . value since Mayer's arrival, even though the company's revenue hasn't . increased under her leadership. Musical chairs: Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer was the one to both hire de Castro (right) to run the company's ad sales department and then fire him 15 months later . Yahoo Inc. previously disclosed de Castro would be getting a severance package, but didn't reveal the amount until Wednesday. The company's board said most of the severance stemmed from the costs of luring de Castro from his previous job at Google. Like many other senior Google executives, de Castro would have received millions in stock by staying at the company. Old ties: De Castro was the vice president of global media and platforms at Google before being brought over to Yahoo by his former colleague, Mayer . That prompted Yahoo to make up for some of the Google awards he had to relinquish when he defected. 'The board believed at the time Mr. de Castro was hired that he had a unique set of highly valuable skills and experiences that would be key to returning the company to long-term growth and success,' Yahoo's compensation committee said in its defense of de Castro's severance pay. The compensation committee ended up having such a dim view of de Castro's performance in 2013 that it decided not to give him a bonus, according to Wednesday's filing. He was eligible for a bonus of up to $540,000, or 90 per cent of the $600,000 salary that he received last year. De Castro's severance package wouldn't have been worth nearly as much if Yahoo's stock hadn't more than doubled during de Castro's brief tenure with the company. But those gains had little to do with the managerial acumen of de Castro, Mayer or any other Yahoo executives. Analysts trace almost all the increase in Yahoo's stock price to the company's 24 per cent stake in China's Alibaba Group, which is running some of the world's fastest-growing and most-profitable e-commerce sites. Alibaba is planning to go public on the New York Stock Exchange and when that happens, Yahoo will be able to reap a multibillion dollar windfall from its holdings in the company. Yahoo headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. The company suddenly finds the seat of COO at the company empty after the swift departure of Mr de Castro . Yahoo's own business remains in a funk. The Sunnyvale, California, company's revenue, minus ad commissions, dipped 1 per cent last year. Advertising sales showed some signs of modest improvement during the first three months of this year, but Yahoo is still lagging the overall growth of Internet marketing. Had Yahoo's stock price remained at roughly the same level as when de Castro joined the company, his severance package value would have been worth about $17million.","Chief operating officer Henrique de Castro was one of Marissa Mayer's key hires but she fired him 15 months later .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . A national fraternity group has shuttered its University of Mississippi chapter amid accusations three members tied a noose around the neck of a statue of the first black student to enroll at the school. Sigma Phi Epsilon, based in Richmond, Va., has closed its Ole Miss chapter after several incidents, including the February noose tying. The names of the three students, all from Georgia, haven't been released. The Southern school was all-white until the 1962 enrollment of eventual . civil rights icon James Meredith broke down the walls of segregation and set off violent protests that left two dead and several injured. Action taken: Sigma Phi Epsilon members who reportedly hung a noose around the James H. Meredith statue on the campus of the University of Mississippi earlier this year have caused the group to be shuttered . Fraternity members are also accused of draping of a pre-2003 Georgia state flag with a Confederate battle emblem in its design on the face of the statue in the pre-dawn hours of Feb. 16. The fraternity booted the students from it's ranks and had been suspended while under review by the national office, but its ultimate fate has now been decided. 'The decision is not a result of any individual incident, but a response to newly discovered, ongoing behavior that includes incidents of hazing, underage drinking, alcohol abuse, and failure to comply with the university and fraternity's codes of conduct,' the fraternity said in a statement released to CNN. 'Though the incident involving the James Meredith statue several months ago did not directly result in the chapter's closure, it did mark the beginning of an intensified period of review.' Disrespectful: James Meredith, the first black student to integrate the University of Mississippi in 1962, speaking to an audience at a 2012 book reading, has not publicly spoken about the incident . A race problem: A current student says students at the school are culturally insensitive . Home base: The Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity house on the campus of the University of Mississippi - it will be taken over by the school after this semester . Ole Miss student Adam Ganucheau told CNN that he believes 'Ole Miss has a race problem,' but it isn't just limited to his school. 'Universities across the Southeast are just more prone to these kind of incidents because of the past history at the [schools],' he said. 'The school has been dealing with race issues since Meredithâ€™s admission, and has been prone to isolated incidents because of its history.' He insisted Ole Miss is taking steps to mitigate such future incidents, but could not say what is being done outside of sensitivity training to this fall's incoming freshmen. A 2013 on-campus performance of 'The Laramie Project,' a play about the 1998 murder of openly gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Sheppard were met with football players shouting derogatory comments at the stage. Students also openly chanted racial slurs to protest President Barack Obama's reelection in 2012. Ole Miss only ditched its Colonel Reb mascot - which evoked strong imagery of the civil war - for a black bear in 2010. Confederate flags were only banned from football games in 2003. Intergration: Students jeered at James Meredith in 1962 as he walked the Ole Miss campus with armed guards . Race riots: US troops patrolled the streets of Jackson, Mississippi, where the school is located, during riots after Meredith's enrollment . Costly: Burned out cars and debris were littered about the campus after the riots . A different world: An effigy of James H. Meredith hangs at right during the riots. Meredith (right) holds a newspaper as he attempts to register . University disciplinary proceedings against the three students are ongoing. according to a school spokesperson, the FBI is also investigating. The Lafayette County district attorney has said state charges won't be brought because no state laws were broken. Mississippi's hate crime law requires an underlying crime for those additional charges. Because the statue itself wasn't marred or broken, prosecutors say typical vandalism charges don't apply. After the noose was found, the university asked the national headquarters to review the 130-member chapter, which had been on campus since 1987. 'The closure is not a result of what happened with the Meredith statue, but the Meredith statue precipitated the intensive review of how they conduct business,' the fraternity added. Controversial: University of Mississippi Rebels mascot, Col. Reb, shown during a 2003 NCAA Tournament game, was replaced in 2010 by a bear . University officials said the national office had previously intervened in 2010 to fix similar problems. 'We are disappointed that a pattern of bad behavior and serious, inexcusable hazing occurred within the chapter,' Dean of Students Sparky Reardon said in a statement. 'Periodic reports from and meetings with local alumni and national headquarters led us to believe that the chapter was improving.' Sigma Phi Epsilon CEO Brian Warren said in a statement the organization had 'no choice' but to close the unit. 'Though it's always painful to close a chapter, these students' actions clearly illustrate a determination to perpetuate an experience based on risky and unconstructive behavior.' Blanton said students currently living in the Sigma Phi Epsilon house on campus would be allowed to stay and eat meals there through the end of the semester, but would not be allowed to have any social activities. After that, the university, which owns the land under the house, and the fraternity would discuss uses for the structure. Sigma Phi officials said they would discuss a return to campus with the university. It's not clear how long that might take. Blanton said that several years ago, the university did not reinstate the closed chapter of another fraternity until all the members at the time of the closure had graduated.
