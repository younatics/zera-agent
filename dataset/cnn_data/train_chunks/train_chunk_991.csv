"West Ham Ladies footballer: Katie Sheppard, 20, sent angry text messages ‘shouting’ at her partner . A rising star of women’s football was found hanging days after a row over her girlfriend’s refusal to tell her parents about their relationship, an inquest heard today. Katie Sheppard, 20, who played for West Ham Ladies, sent angry text messages ‘shouting’ at her partner Nancy Richardson. The midfielder died earlier this year just hours before she was due to begin pre-season training at the club. Her body was found hanging on July 2 by Nathaniel Hall, her mother’s partner, at her home in of Sidcup, south-east London. Today an inquest at Croydon Coroner’s Court in south London heard how officers called to her family home were concerned that the couple may have planned a suicide pact. PC Alex Giacomazzi said he rushed to Miss Richardson’s home after speaking to Miss Sheppard’s brother Christopher, soon after her body was discovered. He told the inquest: ‘I learned that Katie was openly homosexual and her family and friends had accepted that. 'I found out she had a girlfriend called Nancy Richardson. I was worried that there may have been some sort of pact and they did it together.’ But when he turned up at Miss Richardson’s home he had to break the news to her in front of her parents. Miss Richardson revealed communication between the two had been difficult in the days before, the inquest heard. Coroner Dr Adela Williams asked PC Giacomazzi if his investigation had revealed anything of concern before Katie’s death. He told the court he had gone through Miss Richardson’s phone and the tone of the messages from Miss Sheppard had changed. He said: ‘It had suddenly changed very dramatically and Katie started ""shouting"" over text message, using capitals, because Nancy wasn’t telling her parents about the relationship.’ At 10.29am on the day of her death Miss Sheppard sent a chilling message sent to her girlfriend saying: ‘Don’t look at your phone or you might turn up here and I can’t physically answer.’ Trophy: Miss Sheppard died this year just hours before she was due to begin pre-season training at the club . A diary found in her bedroom contained a handwritten note with the message: ‘God forgive me, I sacrifice myself to you and to your kingdom.’ Beside the message was a picture of a coffin with the letter ‘K’ on it, the inquest heard. Doctors records showed Miss Sheppard had been prescribed antidepressants the year before her death, although none were found at her home. Footballer: Miss Sheppard's body was found hanging at her home in of Sidcup, south-east London . A police investigation and post mortem ruled out foul play and gave the cause of death as asphyxia by hanging. Recording an open verdict, coroner Dr Adela Williams said: ‘We are left with a situation where there’s really no explanation for why Katie died. ‘We are left with a young girl who had a really major shift in her life, going to university is a major event in a young girl’s life. I don’t think we know if she intended to do it as a call for help. ‘I don’t find the note itself as evidence that she intended to do it, although I appreciate that’s not satisfactory for the family to hear.’ She added: ‘I’m desperately sorry and I would like to give my sincerest condolences to Katie’s family.’ The former Charlton Athletic junior player had recently returned home for the summer from Kent University. Miss Sheppard, a sports therapy student, had played for West Ham ladies for two years, making four first team appearances in 2012/13. She hoped to go on to play for a U.S. team. In a questionnaire on the Charlton Athletic website, she said she aspired to be like footballer Scott Parker, but that her father was her biggest inspiration. She said of her father: ‘He is the one who takes me to and from games and will always be honest in telling me about how I played and how to progress.’ Miss Sheppard’s family declined to comment as they left today’s hearing.

"A very welcome antidote to another  rainy day at London Fashion Week, Jasper Conran kicked off day two with a lesson in how to dress a woman. The designer, who believes fashion has become 'rather shapeless' lately, was on a mission to flatter the female form and his AW14 collection of silhouette dresses, cashmere coats with relaxed shoulders and shrunken jackets did just that. Speaking about the Jasper Conran woman, the designer told MailOnline: 'She is female as opposed to feminine, she's curved, she's got feminine attributes; she's unashamedly that. 'It's wearable clothes for powerful women with a lot of sexiness.' Powerful but sexy: Jasper Conran kicked off day two of London Fashion Week at the Saatchi Gallery this morning with his undeniably feminine AW14 collection . Jet black, silk-lined dresses with sexy cutaway backs, sculpted dresses in pared back tones and buttery leather jackets were the order of the day at the Saatchi Gallery. Jasper's aim was to create an easy and wearable collection, 'You can wear it to the office and then out at night. You can put the jacket over the top of the sequin dress to cover up and then take it off when you hit the town,' he explained. Red hot: An otherwise pared back collection of buttery soft jackets and sequin dresses was brightened up with a jolt of geranium red . It's all about the coats: Edge-to-edge coats were the stars of the catwalk and they came in the omnipresent sugar spun pink . Edge-to-edge coats were the stars of the catwalk and they came in black, grey, blonde and sugar spun pink with instinctively belted waists. 'It's the idea of being able to slip them off, it's the idea of dressing up - there's a comfort juxtaposed against that sort of saucy underneath piece. It's all about confidence on top and hotness underneath,' he said. Double-faced cashmere, delicately soft leathers and silk tule dresses with a 'quadruple stretch' reigned supreme- but the forceful jolts of geranium red were what took the audience by surprise amidst an otherwise neutral pallete. 'I thought, well, we need some orange here. But I would call it reddish orange - it is a particularly good colour,' said Jasper. Desk to dancefloor: Jasper's main aim was to create a wearable collection with a lot of sexiness . Adding some shape: Jasper believes that fashion has gone slightly shapeless lately and his mission is to emphasise the female form . Accessories were kept to a minimum with just one envelope bag and a mid-high heel because 'if I was a women I would want that, it's as simple as that,' according to the man himself. Front row regular Hilary Alexander was most impressed with what she witnessed this morning. Speaking about the collection, she said: 'It was vintage Jasper. I loved that little navy cashmere sweater and that navy striped skirt. I think it would sell extremely well and the coats were great. 'The bra dress with a swingback jacket in orange was lovely; the whole collection was very easy.' Man of the moment: Jasper stepped out to loud applause at the end of his show this morning . Family matters: Richard E Grant, along with Jasper's entire family, held fort on the front row at his show today . Orange keyhole tunic dress, £65, navy flared dress, £65, navy speckled tunic top, £55, all J by Jasper Conran at Debenhams . He's been around so long, he's practically part of the furniture but on this showing, it seems unlikely that London will ever get bored of John Rocha. His razor-sharp grasp of technical detail and gloriously romantic vision were once again in evidence, with his signature ruffles and judicious use of colour drawing appreciative gasps from the watching fashion pack. Intricate: With his razor-sharp grasp of technical detail and gloriously romantic vision, how could we ever tire of John Rocha? Embellishment appeared in the form of applique flowers that bloomed across bodices and trailed gently down skirts, while dresses that could have been dull were given a shot in the arm with eye-catching rosettes and sculpted hemlines. Lovely though they were, the highlight was surely a stunning tiered crimson cocktail dress, styled with a matching hat, that blazed a feather-like trail down the body. Texture: Dresses that could have been dull were given a shot in the arm with eye-catching rosettes, sculpted hemlines and a whole lot of texture . Other high points in the dress heavy show included a delicate feathered dress and a spectacular ruffled skirt suit in steel grey. While the colours were muted, with black, grey and crimson reigning supreme, the textured silhouettes more than made up for it. With daughter Simone showing later on this week, John proved, once again, that while there might be two designers named Rocha, neither are to be missed. As for beauty, nail supremo Shreen Gayle layered Essie's Bobbing For Baubles with Chinchilla and topping it off with Matte About You.

"Manchester City will welcome winger Samir Nasri back in to their squad for the Capital One Cup tie with Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium. Nasri has not played since damaging his groin in the Champions League loss at Bayern Munich on September 17. But the French international is back in contention after making a quicker than expected recovery. Samir Nasri was pictured back in training with Manchester City's squad following his groin injury . 'Nasri is working and is in the squad list,' said City boss Manuel Pellegrini. 'I don't know if he will play. I will decide tomorrow.' Frank Lampard is the only player unavailable to the Chilean due to a thigh muscle strain. The former Chelsea midfielder is also expected to be ruled out of Sunday's Manchester derby against bitter rivals United. Nasri's return would provide a welcome boost after Saturday's shock 2-1 defeat at West Ham left the Premier League champions third in the table and six points behind leaders Chelsea. 'We are disappointed,' admitted Pellegrini. 'West Ham played well but we didn't deserve to lose. We didn’t convert the chances. 'All the other teams will drop points. Every point you drop makes it harder but last season we were quite a few points behind as well. There are many points left and we just want to fight for them.' Nasri looks on as James Miulner helps Yaya Toure back to his feet in training on Tuesday . City's star midfielders Toure and David Silva bump into each other as they watch events elsewhere . Saturday saw City's second league defeat in nine games this season. Despite also struggling to qualify from their Champions League group, Pellegrini insisted that his side had not been worked out by the opposition. 'We have to analyse the Champions League after the group, not now. The Premier League last year was exactly the same. People criticised us and said we had to change and that we didn’t know how to play away. We won four from the first 18 points away last season. Things change but we know we have to improve.' Nasri was man of the match as City beat Sunderland at Wembley to lift the Capital One Cup in March, and while Pellegrini admits the club have other priorities this season he will not neglect to defend the silverware. 'It’s important for the club to win trophies, it doesn’t matter which one. We want to be involved in all four but winning a competition at Wembley – the most important stadium in the world – in front of 80,000 people who were singing was special. Captain Vincent Kompany protects the ball under pressure from striker Edin Dzeko at the Etihad Stadium . Goalkeeper Joe Hart shows there's more to his games than just glovework with a fancy backheel flick . 'I tell the players to try to win every game. We don’t have to say which competition is most important. Of course we would prefer to win the Premier League but that doesn’t mean we don’t want to win the Capital One Cup because we do.' Pellegrini also received a personal boost when he was named on FIFA's 10-man shortlist for the World Coach of the Year award. Chelsea's Jose Mourinho and Manchester United's Louis van Gaal are among the other managers up for the gong, but will face stiff competition from the likes of World Cup-winning Germany manager Joachim Low and Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti. 'I heard today,' said Pellegrini. 'Normally it is the coaches that win the big leagues that are nominated and those that win the World Cup. That’s what happens. Of course it's nice but it's nicer to win the league here.'","Samir Nasri nearing comeback after month out with groin injury .

"Click here to read Sami Mokbel's report from Hull's 2-2 draw at Arsenal . Steve Bruce was in the mood for celebrating on Saturday night despite Arsenal's late equaliser at the Emirates. It had looked as if Hull would be leaving the capital with all three points, only for Danny Welbeck to strike in stoppage time. That, however, didn't stop Bruce - who was understandably proud of his side - hotfooting it up to Manchester for Sam Allardyce's 60th birthday bash. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch...

The 53-year-old was pictured riding the Piccadilly Line of the London underground from Arsenal, presumably to Euston train station before heading north. Welbeck's late show was all the more galling for Bruce after he revealed the Tigers could have signed the former Manchester United striker before he eventually opted for a move to the Gunners. 'He had a pick shall we say but, yes, we had a dabble,' Bruce said. 'I've got no doubt in my mind after working with him that he can play at any top four side, no question. He's a top player. 'He's played a lot on the left (for United) and then people start criticising his goalscoring record, but you put him down the middle as a striker and he will score.'

"A pristine community garden in East London that took volunteers three years to create has been decimated by flytippers. Yobs dumped 49 tonnes of junk – equivalent to the weight of around four double decker buses – on a horticultural oasis the size of a football field on Mabley Green in Hackney, East London. Hackney Council has already spent £10,500 moving the mountain of construction and household waste, including rubble and glass, with clear-up costs set to increase further.

"'Belittled': Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement, 30, hanged herself in her room at Bulford Barracks, Wiltshire, after being off sick with stress . A woman soldier who was struggling to cope with working 80-hour weeks hanged herself, an inquest heard yesterday. Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement told friends and family that she was called in for duty on her weekends off and even when she was signed off on sick leave. The 30-year-old said she was belittled and slated by senior colleagues for her work, with one even writing criticisms on Facebook. Royal Military Policewoman Ellement was found hanged on a fire escape on October 9 last year at Bulford Barracks near Salisbury, Wiltshire, shortly after returning from sick leave. Her death came after she learned on Facebook that an ex-boyfriend had started seeing someone else. Police found the words ‘I’m sorry’ scrawled in lipstick on her bedroom mirror. An inquest in Salisbury heard that Corporal Ellement, who was from Bournemouth, had always wanted to be in the Army and had joined the Royal Military Police in November 2006. She served in Northern Ireland and Germany before being posted to Bulford Camp after making an allegation of rape against two male colleagues. She served with 158 Provost Company and was described as a ‘competent’ investigator who was finding her role as shift commander a ‘challenge’. Corporal Ellement’s father, Kenneth, told the coroner his daughter was working 80-hour weeks and had ‘welfare problems’. ‘Recently she told me she had five days off with stress and in the last month she was doing an acting staff sergeant job,’ he said. However, her family did not detect any problems as she celebrated her 30th birthday with them days before her death. 'Pressure': The corporal had been criticised by colleagues on Facebook and had discovered her ex was seeing someone new . Lance Corporal Rachel Percival said her friend had spoken of work colleagues ‘making her life hell’ and ‘belittling’ her. She said Corporal Ellement felt she . ‘wasn’t good enough’. ‘No matter what she did, it was wrong.’ Lance . Corporal Percival recalled three occasions when her friend was called by . work while on sick leave. Lance Corporal Rebecca Joseph added that Corporal Ellement was on the receiving end of a lot of stick but that ‘she gave as good as she got’. In September last year military medics signed Corporal Ellement off sick with stress. Before leaving she was interviewed by Captain Sean Kimber, who at that time was second in command of her company. He told the hearing that she told him she felt she was struggling in her role as shift commander and was uncomfortable working under her staff sergeant. He said: ‘Anne-Marie wasn’t failing in her duty as shift commander. She found it a challenge. It was that transitional period of going from being an investigator and looking after just your own work, to a supervisor role.’ Captain Kimber said he would not advocate anybody working 80 hours a week nor would he stand for the Facebook slating that Corporal Ellement’s family said she received. On the afternoon of Corporal Ellement’s death, friends described seeing her sitting on the fire escape appearing tearful. One heard her exclaim ‘****ing men’. In the early evening she was found hanging by a purple scarf. Ian Singleton, assistant deputy coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon, recorded a verdict that Corporal Ellement took her own life. Her family declined to comment after the hearing.

"They are two of the richest and most famous men in Britain. But it appears that Sir Richard Branson and Sir Paul McCartney may be about to have a falling out with each other. The pair are at loggerheads over a farm in the Caribbean which breeds turtles for food. Scroll down for video . Disagreement: Sir Richard Branson, right, and Sir Paul McCartney, left, may be about to have a major falling out with each other. The pair are at loggerheads over a farm in the Caribbean which breeds turtles for food . Last month Sir Paul threw his weight behind a campaign to end the breeding of sea turtles at The Cayman Turtle Farm in the Cayman Islands. But after visiting the islands Sir Richard has now controversially said that he backs the turtle farm. A World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) investigation has accused the facility of cruelty and former Beatle Sir Paul believes there is no humane way to farm turtles. But Sir Richard has now come out in favour of the farm despite saying that his view will attract criticism from the Oceanic Elders group which looks at addressing world problems. In an interview with Cayman 27 news channel Sir Richard said: 'I haven’t actually visited the farm but I have asked an awful lot of questions while I have been here. 'From afar I was against the farm. I have listened to people locally and I personally think the farm is a good idea and the reason I think that is you are one of the few countries that ban the killing of the turtles in the ocean so turtles are protected in the ocean. Campaigner: Last month Sir Paul McCartney threw his support behind a campaign to end the breeding sea turtles for food . 'In the Virgin Islands you can catch turtles and drag them out of the sea and the turtle farm avoids that having to happen. 'The second thing is the turtle farm is one of your biggest tourist attractions. It does supply a little bit of food for the people who traditionally have liked to eat turtle meat and I think there are some improvements that can be made to the farm but all in all I think it serves a positive need rather than a negative need. 'I am sure I will get some criticism from the Oceanic Elders when I go back for taking that stance but that is what I believe from being here.' On his blog he added: 'What I’ve learnt from my visit is that unlike many other islands in the Caribbean, the Government have banned the hunting and killing of turtles in the sea. 'By breeding the turtles on land, they’ve created the biggest tourist attraction in the Cayman Islands and satisfied the few locals who continue to eat turtles as part of their age-old tradition. 'Obviously for many of us around the world we’d prefer that didn’t happen but in my opinion it’s certainly better than taking them from the sea. 'I've met the Chief Minister about the farm and he agrees there are some improvements that need to be made. 'There are still too many kept in one tank at a time and the farm needs to ensure there are regular checks of the water quality and also monitor the health of the turtles. 'The local experts assured me changes were happening and the farm also releases a lot into the ocean which is building up the numbers in the wild. 'All in all I believe the Cayman Islands do a fine job protecting their oceans, as well as the turtles and other species in them. There is still more to do but there are many bigger battles for the OceanElders and WSPA to fight.' Last month Sir Paul McCartney threw his support behind a campaign to end the breeding of sea turtles for food. The facility in the Cayman Islands was identified by officials at the World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) as the world’s last surviving commercial turtle farm. Staff at the base breed the endangered marine reptiles for human consumption, and The Beatles star joined the WSPA’s campaign to end the trade. In a post on his official website, McCartney wrote: 'The Cayman Turtle Farm is the last place on Earth that breeds endangered sea turtles for food. On Twitter, he added:  'There is no humane way to farm sea turtles. Support WSPA campaign to stop sea turtle farming.' A WSPA spokesman said: 'To have Sir Paul McCartney’s support for this campaign is tremendous and we hope that people will join him and WSPA in helping to save the Cayman Islands’ green sea turtles.'

"UEFA have modified CSKA Moscow's punishment for trouble by their fans at their Champions League match away to AS Roma on appeal. CSKA were originally ordered to play their next three European home games behind closed doors after incidents involving their supporters, including racist behaviour, crowd trouble and setting off flares during the 5-1 defeat in Roma on September 17. UEFA announced on Tuesday that the ban now applies to two matches. Manchester City and CSKA Moscow line up ahead in the empty stadium ahead of the Champions League clash .

A CSKA fan tries to pick a fight with Italian police as other supporters try to hold him back . 'The latest (of the three matches) is suspended for a probationary period of five years,' UEFA added, referring to the modification. The Russian Premier League champions have already played the first of the two matches of the original suspension, a 2-2 draw against Manchester City in Moscow last week. Their next visitors will be Roma. The Army Men also had their fine reduced from £158,000 (200,000 euros) to £79,000 (100,000 euros). Their prohibition from selling tickets for their next two Champions League away games stands. CSKA would not comment with their press officer Sergey Aksenov saying: 'We are not ready to make any comments until we receive the official reasoning for their decision.

The CSKA fans watched their side come from behind to secure a point against Manchester City . UEFA had ordered the match to be played behind closed doors because of racist behaviour by CSKA fans . The team's draw with City gave them their first points after three group matches. They lost 5-1 in Rome and 1-0 at home to unbeaten group leaders Bayern Munich. City were left furious last week after UEFA revealed they would not take action against CSKA  for allowing fans in to their behind closed doors match. The visitors were flabbergasted to see 300 rowdy Russian fans standing drinking beer — itself a breach of Champions League rules — in the main stand of the Khimki Arena in Moscow to watch their side snatch a 2-2 draw with a disputed late penalty. Hearing stories of media passes and sponsor tickets being sold to CSKA fans and suspicious that security staff may also have let fans through the gates, City asked UEFA to look in to the issue. However, UEFA declared themselves happy with the way things had been handled, prompting dismay and anger at City whose own travelling fans had been prevented by police from reaching an apartment overlooking the stadium from which they planned to watch the game.","UEFA have modified CSKA Moscow's punishment for fan trouble .

"Kit Symons will be announced as Fulham’s new manager this week, barring any last minute change of heart by Shahid Khan. The Cottagers owner is due to fly back to London on Wednesday night, with his caretaker boss likely to be appointed on Thursday. Symons has overseen five wins from his eight games in charge, leaving Khan with little choice but to promote the coach. Kit Symons (pictured) is expected to be confirmed as Fulham manager this week by owner Shahid Khan . The 64-year-old was handed a trio of prospective new bosses by the five-man search committee installed to ‘provide guidance’ in their quest to find Felix Magath’s successor.

Symons took temporary charge at the back end of September with Fulham rooted to the foot of the Championship table.

"When last season saw PPQ's Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parker shun their trademark pop art prints in favour of Oscar-worthy gowns, the fashion pack was caught flat-footed. Luckily for print fans, their focus on Hollywood hasn't lasted and this time around, the design duo opted for a quirky celebration of all that's fabulous about London's rock n' roll party scene. Prints, metallics and some wonderfully wearable cashmere coats combined to make A/W14 one of their best collections to date. Elegant: PPQ's London rocker inspired look combined edgy styling with luxe fabrics . The duo themselves described their muse as ‘pale and very significant, swathed in a multitude of very necessary textures in her winter embrace’. This translated as a catwalk awash with plenty of fur, powder pink silk catsuits, metallic leggings and lashings of edgy PVC. Speaking ahead of their show at London's Sanderson hotel last night, Amy told MailOnline: ‘This season we’ve gone very London and the models we’ve chosen are all very PPQ. ‘They’re models that have been with us for a long time, they’ve grown up with PPQ and we wanted to reconnect with them. ‘We’ve been on lots of different journeys but this season, our PPQ jean is back, our bomber jacket is back; just pieces that we’ve missed.’ Modern metallics: The label's oversized roses got a modern update courtesy of jazzy silver and gold tailoring . Pastel perfection: The lilac trend looks set to continue into next autumn if PPQ have their way . Speaking about the PPQ woman for A/W14, Amy said: ‘It’s not very King’s Road, it’s our London vibe. I wouldn’t say she lives in the city, I’d say she lives more in the countryside but she’s definitely rock ‘n’ roll. ‘She’s a party girl but she likes weekends away in the country.’ Their signature print for the season came in the form of what they describe as ‘a kind of beauty and the beast rose’. Amy, who was born in South Africa and brought up in Cheshire, and Percy, who hails from the Isle of Wight, took their signature floral motif and turned up the volume, splashing across sumptuous satin in a dirty lilac hue. ‘It’s got that really edgy feel but it’s still a luxury fabric,’ explained Amy. Dapper: Made in Chelsea's Ollie Proudlock looked sharp in a sky blue suit and a cool pair of specs . Glamorous: TV presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford and model Chloe Hayward upped the fashion ante front row . Highlights included a floor length velvet number, which Amy admitted she had a ‘bit of a crush on’, as well as high shine PVC bombers and a fur trimmed catsuit. The duo, who celebrated after the show at their favourite haunt, the Long Bar at Sanderson, revealed they’d love to see Ellie Goulding take centre stage in one of their designs. While the songstress was absent this season, the front row was occupied by a galaxy of stars, among them Made in Chelsea's Ollie Proudlock and model-turned-actress, Chloe Hayward. But while the front row caught the eye, they couldn't compete with the clothes: PPQ's print-heavy greatest hits collection proving the real star of the show.","PPQ show at Sanderson hotel included overblown lilac rose prints .

'I'd like to have a team that fights for 90 minutes and has the confidence to show what kind of team we are. If we do that then what ever the score is I'm happy.' The Capital One Cup has provided a welcome distraction from their league struggles but Hyypia insists the club, who reached the play-offs in the last two seasons, can still have a successful campaign. 'I have high targets for this season still and we still have time to reach those targets but something needs to change,' he said.

"Harry Redknapp claimed QPR will fight to the end after Charlie Austin’s stunning double against Aston Villa lifted them off the bottom for the table. Austin scored in each half to pile the misery on Paul Lambert’s side and they are now without a goal in a staggering 531 minutes of football in the Barclays Premier League.

Harry Redknapp (right) saw his side move off the bottom of the table following victory over Aston Villa . Charlie Austin drills in his second goal on 69 minutes to secure a 2-0 victory over Aston Villa . Redknapp said: ‘It was a great result. We played well against Liverpool, Stoke, Hull and Sunderland and we worked hard again. ‘They were two great finishes for Charlie. I couldn’t be more pleased. He’s a fantastic lad, an absolutely smashing boy. ‘He’s come from non-league, played at Poole Town, Hungerford, god knows hwere he has been around the lower divisions. And now he is scoring goals in the Premier league, it’s great for him. ‘It is always important to get the points. I have no need to deflect the result, as I was supposed to have done. ‘Part of a football club is having good lads, but they can’t all play.

And he was doing that during the game. He wants the team to win.’ Redknapp claimed his row with Adel Taarabt is over and revealed that the winger, recovering from a sore throat, will play in a reserve team game on Tuesday. The QPR chief said: ‘He’s working hard this week with the fitness coaches and the reserves have a game tomorrow so he will get a game into him. ‘It’s finished. He can still play a part in the future if he gets himself fit.

"Rosetta’s comet is a unique, multi-faceted world that features huge cliffs, plunging craters and house-sized boulders. Now a colourful map revealing its stunning landscape has been created by mission scientists in Darmstadt following data sent back from the probe. The map is expected to help researchers pick a suitable place to drop a lander in November – the first time a landing on a comet has ever been attempted. Scroll down for video . Several different surface regions are shown in this map, which is oriented with the comet's 'body' in the foreground and the 'head' in the background. The map was used to help researchers pick a suitable place to drop a lander in November . The map shows 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko’s ‘continents’ based on the variations on the comet’s surface. Various areas are dominated by cliffs, depressions, craters, boulders and even parallel grooves, with some regions still being shaped by the comet’s activity. As both 67P and Rosetta travel closer to the sun over the next months, the mission control team will monitor the surface looking for changes. While the scientists don’t expect the borderlines of the comet’s regions to vary dramatically, more subtle transformations could help explain more about how comets form. Jagged cliffs and prominent boulders are visible in this image taken by on 5 September 2014 from a distance of 39 miles (62km) from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The left part of the image shows a side view of the comet's 'body', while the right is the back of its 'head'. One pixel corresponds to 3.6ft (1.1 metres) Next weekend, on 13 and 14 September, the maps will play a key role as Rosetta’s Lander Team and the Rosetta orbiter scientists to decide where they will park the Philae lander. An announcement on their decision will be made on 15 September. Once Philae leaves Rosetta to head for 67P/C-G, there will be no chance to alter its path. It will take between five and eight hours to reach the comet’s surface and be pulled in by its weak gravity. Earlier this week, Rosetta has uncovered some surprising features about comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Instead of imaging a bright, ice-covered comet, the probe’s instruments have detected that 67P is in fact darker than charcoal in some wavelengths of light. And scientists working on Rosetta’s Alice instrument have so far failed to find any large patches of water-ice on 67P’s surface. An artist's impression of the Rosetta orbiter at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Instead of imaging a bright, ice-covered comet, the probe’s instruments have detected that 67P is in fact darker than charcoal . Rosetta has measured the temperature of the comet and determined that . its average surface temperature is about -70°C (-94°F). Although . it may seem cold, that is actually 20 to 30°C (36 to 54°F) warmer than . predicted for a comet at that distance, suggesting its surface will be . quite dusty in addition to being icy. 'This . result is very interesting, since it gives us the first clues on the . composition and physical properties of the comet’s surface,' says Virtis . principal investigator Fabrizio Capaccioni from Rome, Italy. This suggests that much of the surface must be dusty, because darker material heats up and emits heat more readily than ice. ‘We're a bit surprised at just how unreflective the comet's surface is and how little evidence of exposed water-ice it shows,’ said Alan Stern, Alice principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado. Scientists had previously believed the comet’s surface would contain ice because it was too far away for the sun’s warmth to melt it. The lack of ice could suggest that the comet had been in close with our sun, or a different star, at some point during its journey in deep space. They also found that the 'coma' - or atmosphere - around the comet contains of hydrogen and oxygen. This is surprising as comas are generally thought to be composed of water vapour and dust. Described as ‘the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever’, Rosetta will spend more than a year analysing the comet to help uncover the secrets to life on Earth. The comet itself is about 2.5 miles (4km) long and orbits the sun every six-and-a-half years. It is heading towards the sun, so as it nears the star it will begin to melt more. For a sense of scale, the comet is about three times the size of Ben Nevis and Rosetta is the size of a car with 105ft (32 metre) wings. Zoom in on the image below to find out where Rosetta is at the moment . Five sites were identified on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the Landing Site Selection Group meeting held 23–24 August.

"Sami Osmakac, 25, from the former Yugoslavia, has been charged with an alleged plot to attack crowded locations in Tampa, including a nightclub . A 25-year-old Muslim man born in Kosovo allegedly developed a bomb plot to attack crowded locations in Tampa with a car bomb, machine guns and other explosives. Sami Osmakac, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Kosovo - a disputed Balkan state once a part of the former Yugoslavia that declared its independence from Serbia in 2008 - was charged today with one count of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. Osmakac, of Pinellas County, Florida, . allegedly bought explosives and guns from an undercover FBI agent, which . had been made unusable. He told the agent last month that he wanted an AK-47-style machine gun and Uzi submachine guns, investigators said. Osmakac was arrested on Saturday and is due to appear in court on Monday after being charged over the alleged bomb plot in Tampa. Shortly before his arrest he made a . video of himself explaining his motives for carrying out the planned . attack, authorities said. In the eight-minute video he is seen cross-legged on the floor with a pistol in his hand and an AK-47 gun behind him, authorities said. He said in the video that Muslim blood . was more valuable than that of people who do not believe in Islam, . according to a criminal complaint. Osmakac allegedly added that he wanted 'payback' for wrong that was done to Muslims and bring terror to his 'victims' hearts' in Tampa. A confidential source allegedly told federal officials in September 2011 - the 10th anniversary of 9/11 - that Osmakac wanted Al Qaeda flags. Two months later he talked with the source and ‘discussed and identified potential targets in Tampa’ that he wanted to attack, authorities said. Scroll down for video . Target: Osmakac allegedly said he wanted to bomb night clubs, a business and the Operations Center of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, pictured . Osmakac allegedly wanted help getting . the firearms and explosives for the attacks, and was put in touch with . an undercover FBI employee. 'This would crush everything man, they would have no more food coming in. They would, nobody would have work' 'Sami Osmakac' Last month Osmakac met with the agent and allegedly told him that he wanted to buy weapons including an AK-47-style machine gun. He also allegedly wanted Uzi submachine guns, high capacity magazines, grenades and explosive belt. Osmakac . gave the agent a $500 down payment for the items in a later meeting and . outlined his intentions to build bombs, authorities said. Arms: The former resident of Kosovo told the agent last month that he wanted an AK-47-style machine gun and Uzi submachine guns, pictured, investigators said . He . allegedly wanted to build bombs to go in three different vehicles, blow . them up remotely and conduct a follow-up attack using his other . weapons. Weapon: Osmakac met with an undercover FBI agent and allegedly told him that he wanted to buy an AK-47-style machine gun, pictured . Osmakac allegedly said at another meeting earlier this month that he wanted to bomb . night clubs, a business and the Operations Center of the Hillsborough . County Sheriff's Office. It is also believed he wanted to blow up an Irish pub and Starbucks coffee shop. He allegedly added that he wanted to . detonate a car bomb and use the explosive belt to ‘get in somewhere . where there's a lot of people’. Osmakac told the agent that he wanted to take hostages and then demand something from the 'kuffar' - an Arabic word that means infidels or disbelievers of Islam, authorities said. 'Once I have this…they can take me in five million pieces,' Osmakac allegedly told the agent, referring to law enforcement officers, reported ABC News. 'I want to do something terrifying, like one day, one night, something's going to happen, then six hours later something else,' he allegedly told the agent. 'This is going to terrify them.' The FBI believe he unsuccessfully tried to get other people to carry out attacks too, reported ABC News. The agent told Osmakac he could always change his mind about his plot. Osmakac - who was arrested in Tampa for battery four months ago - allegedly shook his head and stated: ‘We all have to die, so why not die the Islamic way?’ Criminal complaint: Osmakac has been charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and if convicted could be fined $250,000 and jailed for life . Authorities do not believe he planned . to attack the Republican National Convention, which will be in Tampa in . August. But they thanked the local Muslim community for assistance in . the investigation. According to the affidavit, he also told . the agent: 'Honestly, I would love to go for the Army people, but their . bases are so locked up, I have to do something else.' 'We all have to die, so why not die the Islamic way?' 'Sami Osmakac' Osmakac said he wanted to take down bridges that link Tampa to neighbouring Pinellas County. 'This will crush the whole economy,' authorities claimed he said to the agent. 'This would crush everything man, they would have no more food coming in. They would, nobody would have work.' He was allegedly arrested after he was shown by the agent how to arm a bomb and he connected what he believed was a detonator, preparing to drive off.

"Suits you Sophie: The Countess's red outfit dazzles as she keeps a close eye on son James . First Prince Charles was bemused by being described as ‘quite buff’ during his 1970s sporting heyday. Now his brother Edward has unveiled his own toned torso on a family holiday in the Med. Edward and Sophie Wessex – who also looked impressively trim in a dazzling red one-piece swimsuit – enjoyed a day at a public beach with their children on the tiny uninhabited island of Espalmador, off Ibiza, which is famous with some visitors for its naturist beaches and mud baths. The Countess, who turns 50 next year, has been putting in a lot of work at the gym in a bid to keep up with the glamour of the Duchess of Cambridge – and it has clearly paid off. Sophie has dropped a dress size and shed a stone in weight after taking hour-long exercise sessions several times a week with a personal trainer. Edward, who celebrated his 50th in March, also looked trim. He has been so impressed by his wife’s transformation that he engaged the same trainer. The couple, who celebrated their 15th wedding anniversary last month, now go on twice-weekly five-mile runs around the grounds of their home at Bagshot Park, near Windsor. Friends say they decided to get fitter after Kate married into the Royal Family. ‘It’s a case of keeping up with the Cambridges,’ said one source. ‘Sophie started to dress better, she shopped at designer stores and dropped a dress size and a stone in weight after hiring her trainer. ‘She didn’t want to be seen as the frumpy one so she sharpened up her act. She takes her fitness, diet, and health very seriously and recently Edward saw how much better she looked. He started using Sophie’s personal trainer and he’s delighted with the results.’ The Prince, who left the Royal Marines during basic training, declaring: ‘I’m no Rambo’, is said to love the ‘boot-camp’ work-outs. Comments about the Royal physique caused bewilderment and laughter this month at a function at a swimming pool attended by the Prince of Wales. The only way is Wessex: Sophie joins her husband Edward and their son James for a dip on Espalmador, a tiny uninhabited island off Ibiza . Under cover: The family, watched by a protection officer, don white tops as the sun gets stronger . A topless photograph of a muscular Charles in his diving days in the 1970s was discussed, and a guest described him as ‘quite buff’. Prince William was also at the event and had to explain the reference to his father. Edward and Sophie arrived in the Balearics a week ago with their children Lady Louise, ten, and James, Viscount Severn, six. Traditionally the Wessexes holiday in the Bahamas and Positano in Italy. By visiting Ibiza, they are following in the footsteps of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who in 2010 stayed at a villa on the Spanish island belonging to Kate’s colourful uncle Gary Goldsmith – the infamous Maison de Bang Bang. The Wessexes are believed to be staying aboard a luxury yacht belonging to a close friend. Later in the summer they will return to Britain to visit the Queen and Prince Philip for their traditional break at Balmoral. Sophie and the Queen are said to be exceptionally close.

"Face masked by bandages, she is the tiny victim of a brutal massacre. Now, lying in a makeshift bed, she pleads with Allah to punish the men who killed her brother and may cost her her sight. The child, believed to be about five, was one of scores of civilians to be injured during the bombing of the rebel city of Homs by Syrian government troops yesterday. A video which surfaced online appears to show her being carried through the streets by her distraught father. She was treated for her injuries - including a leg wound too horrific to show - but it is unclear what hope she has of recovery. Scroll down for video . Senseless: The girl's heavily-bandaged head clearly indicates the severity of her injuries . Still in danger: Helicopters and tanks are today attacking Homs, leading residents to fear an 'imminent' ground invasion by government forces . Desperate circumstances: The girl sits in a makeshift bed in a building which has provided a temporary refuge for her family . Speaking from her bed today, she said: 'God is greater than you Bashar (the Syrian president). May God deprive you of your children like you deprived me of my brother. What did we do that made you do this to us?' Today, as Syrian forces continued to bombard Homs with shells raining down every 30 seconds, Britain and America both withdrew their ambassadors from the city of Damascus. In a statement to the House of Commons, William Hague said that he had also summoned the Syrian ambassador in London to the Foreign Office to make clear its 'abhorrence' at the violence in the country. He condemned President Bashar Assad's 'doomed' and 'murdering' regime and was highly critical of China and Russia for vetoing a United Nations Security Council resolution aimed at ending the bloodshed. Mr Hague said their actions were a 'betrayal of the Syrian people' and increased the likelihood of civil war. 'The human suffering in Syria is already unimaginable and is in grave danger of escalating further,' he said. He confirmed that the British ambassador Simon Collins has been withdrawn. 'We will use our remaining channels to the Syrian regime to make clear our abhorrence at the violence that is utterly unacceptable to the civilised world,' he went on. 'The position taken by Russia and China has regrettably made this more likely. 'However this Government, this House, and our country and our allies will not forget the people of Syria. 'We will redouble our efforts to put pressure on this appalling regime and to stop this indefensible violence.' Innocent victim: A Syrian man holds a girl who activists say was seriously wounded in the Baba Amr neighbourhood of Homs by shells fired by regime forces on Saturday . Russia and China were the only two nations on the 15-strong Security Council to vote against the Arab League-backed resolution. Mr Hague said: 'They chose to side with the Syrian regime and implicitly to leave the door open to further abuses by them. 'They did so while President Assad's . tanks were encircling Homs and shells were pounding the homes of Syrian . civilians, killing up to 200 people, and on the 30th anniversary of the . massacre in Hama. Pulling out: America today closed its embassy in Damascus . 'We regard this veto as a grave error of judgment by the governments of China and Russia. 'There is no need to mince words . about this. Russia and China have twice vetoed reasonable and necessary . action by the United Nations Security Council. 'Such vetoes are a betrayal of the . Syrian people. In deploying them, they have let down the Arab League, . they have increased the likelihood of what they wish to avoid in Syria - . civil war - and they have placed themselves on the wrong side of Arab . and international opinion.' Mr Hague said that Britain and other . nations would consider a resolution at the UN General Assembly, in the . absence of a UN Security Council resolution. As diplomatic pressure intensified, Syrian forces continued to bombard Homs with shells, raining down every 30 seconds. The attack, which residents claim is . aimed at a makeshift hospital run by anti-government forces, has not . lapsed since it began at 6am local time. Activists inside Syria claim that more than 50 people have been killed. Helicopters and tanks are also attacking Homs, leading residents to fear an 'imminent' ground invasion by government forces. A British national who has gone to the country to provide humanitarian aid said that the situation is desperate. Speaking to ITV news from the makeshift hospital . in Homs, he said that bodies were being brought in in pieces because . they had been hit by heavy artillery. He said many were unrecognisable. The international community continued . to condemn Syria's actions with the U.S. government closing its embassy . in Damascus and pulling all its diplomats out. The mood inside the city is that a . final showdown is just hours away. One anti-government protester, known . only as Omar, told the BBC: 'This battle will be the last battle.' The bloodshed comes one day after . President Assad's government vowed to continue its crackdown on . the nearly 11-month-old uprising. Under fire: A still taken from a video uploaded on YouTube shows the aftermath of an attack by Syrian government forces on a makeshift hospital, run by anti-government rebels, in Homs this morning . Brutal: Smoke billows from the Baba Amr neighbourhood after it was bombarded by Syrian troops . It comes two days after another heavy . bombardment that claimed the lives of more than 200 people in a single . day, the deadliest incident of the uprising so far. As many as 300 people have been killed in Homs over the weekend. The regime of President Bashar el-Assad denied any bombardment took place. William Hague yesterday warned Russia . and China that the blood of Syrian protesters will be on their hands . for failing to stand up to the ‘murdering’ regime. The Foreign Secretary could not . conceal his anger following their decision to veto a UN resolution . calling for al-Assad's resignation. He said Moscow and Beijing would be . ‘held responsible’ for what happens in Syria and that he could not . understand their support for a ‘doomed regime as well as a murdering . regime’. He warned the veto marked ‘an hour of shame’ for the UN. His remarks were echoed by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who said the veto was a ‘travesty’ and called for the ‘friends of democratic Syria’ to unite against . al-Assad. Human rights groups say at least 7,000 people have died since the uprising began in March. A draft resolution condemning Syria was supported by 13 of the 15 UN . Security Council members when it was put to a vote on Saturday, meaning . it was not adopted. It was the second time in four months that Russia has obstructed a resolution condemning Syria. Mr Hague said yesterday: ‘Increasingly, Russia and China will be held responsible for this continuing appalling situation. ‘They are standing in the way of the . UN Security Council taking a clear position, backing a very good plan . for the way forward by the Arab League. It will have consequences for . their influence in the Middle East. They are turning their backs on the . Arab world. ‘Russia and China are very isolated in the indefensible position they have taken up.’ The Foreign Secretary also warned . that al-Assad could step up his reprisals against anti-government . protesters. ‘Will he have been emboldened by the fact that Russia and . China vetoed the resolution?’ he said. ‘Yes, I think so and I think it does . mean that Russia and China do bear increasingly, as these events . continue, increased responsibility for what is happening.’ Mourners gather around the coffins of the victims who were killed on Saturday by the bombardment of mortars and rockets during a mass funeral procession in the Khaldiyeh district of Homs . Bodies laid out for burial. Russia and China vetoed a draft resolution to condemn Syria and thus was not adopted, both to the U.S. and UK's lament . Mrs Clinton, on a visit to the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, this weekend, echoed Mr Hague’s comments. ‘What happened at the United Nations was a travesty,’ she said. ‘We will work to expose those who are . still funding the regime and sending it weapons to be used against . defenceless Syrians, including women and children.’ An Al Qaeda leader who allegedly masterminded the July 7, 2005  London bombings has reportedly been freed from a Syrian jail. Abu Musab al-Suri, who is also wanted . in connection with the 2004 Madrid train bombings, was apparently . released in Aleppo, near the Turkish border, last week. His release has been interpreted as a . warning to the United States and Britain over their failure to support . al-Assad during the Syrian uprisings.

"A Florida mother who blogged that her two-year-old son was attacked at Walmart for wearing a pink headband is a self-confessed 'pathological liar' who police believe may have 'made up' the entire story. Lake County Sheriff's deputies said Walmart was still searching for any evidence that Kathleen Carpenter was in fact in the Clermont Walmart the day she claimed an unknown man yanked the headband off Dexter, 2, pushed him and hurled homophobic abuse at them both. The woman failed to report the alleged assault to Walmart management or police but blogged about it for the Huffington Post, sparking intense outrage about the treatment from LGBT supporters across the internet. The news website has now pulled the article and a sheriff's report read: 'Based on the continuing media response through Facebook and generated response to the incident by online subscribers, possible video of the incident may be obtained and viewed to in fact verify that the incident actually did occur or if it was all made up.' Made up? Kathleen Carpenter, pictured, confessed on her blog to being a 'pathological liar' and embellishing stories . Meanwhile, internet skeptics have . revealed Carpenter, who writes under the name, Katie Vyktoriah, described herself as having been a pathological liar in the past. 'It didn’t matter what I was discussing,' she wrote on her blog 'A Mother Thing' in November 2011. 'If I saw the chance to embellish in some way, I jumped on it, re-telling the same story again and again to different groups with different details. Elsewhere on her blog she claimed . to have survived three failed kidnapping attempts and one successful . one; to have been a stewardess for an airline and quit just weeks before . the flight crashed twice in three months and to have missed catching a . train that later crashed. She . also claimed to suffer from Celiac disease, diabetes, lactose . intolerance, BPD, manic depression, ADHD, and declared her breasts were . so spectacular they cause bar fights. When . called on the truthfulness of these claims, Katie responded, according . to Get off My Internets: 'Yes, much of that list was tongue in cheek to . drag out some of my sillier stories into much bigger dramas than they . were. When I wrote it more than a year ago, I drew people's attention to . it as a FUNNY (though accurate) representation of some of the stuff . I’ve been through in my life.' Verbal assault: The mother of two said her son was called a f***** for wearing a pink headband to Walmart . A Huffington Post editor wrote that they pulled the blog at Carpenter's request. 'HuffPost provides a platform for bloggers to share their thoughts and experiences,' it said in the editor's note. 'In a post published last week, an author described witnessing an incident that is now being investigated by local law enforcement. At the blogger's request, we have removed the post. We have also confirmed with investigators that they are in contact with the author. Reporting deputies committed Carpenter for a psychiatric . assessment earlier this week after she began talking about suicide. The . woman sad she became stressed from receiving a barrage of threatening . phone calls and emails. Carpenter told Polk County police the family had . been inundated with threats since details of the incident were . published. After she . reported the harassing calls over the weekend, the mother-of-two was . taken to a hospital as she struggled to cope with the publicity, . according to the Orlando Sentinel. Concerned for her well-being, police arranged for Carpenter to have a mental health assessment, under Florida's Baker's Act. As well as phone calls, the mother-of-two received more than 11,000 emails. Harassed: Kathleen Carpenter, pictured with Mark Reed and their children, was committed for threatening suicide after the blog went viral . In a police report Carpenter told deputies 'that the attention obtained by her story and the negative . comments and communications to her had become too much stress and she . could not handle the situation ... anymore,' and was thinking of killing . herself, the Orlando Sentinel reported. In . her original blog post, she explained that a man approached her son at . the check out and knocked a pink hairband from his head, which he had . been wearing after playing dress up. She claimed the man then said: 'Your son is a f****** f****t. He'll get shot for it one day,' before walking off and leaving Carpenter shaking as she tried to comfort her son. Some people doubted her story immediately and questioned her decision to not inform police. The . 31-year-old has since closed her blog and Twitter account and, in a . Facebook post seen by News 13, she said: 'I am going to be offline for . the next while until all of this is resolved.' In . her blog, she explained how she confronted a stranger who had knocked . the headband from her son and told him: 'You'll thank me one day . little man.' Carpenter . said in her blog that her son just enjoyed playing dress up, and added . that two-year-old children did not have any sexuality.

"A 46-year-old Philadelphia man charged with putting . heroin and methadone in his infant son’s bottle, killing him, was convicted Tuesday of third-degree murder. Orlando . Rosado was charged with third-degree murder and drug delivery causing . death in the case. Proscutors claimed he put the drugs in his son's bottle . to quieten the baby, unintentionally killing him, but the judge said there was no evidence he intentionally administered the drugs. Orlando Rosado, 46, did not testify at the one-day trial, but the defense said Rosado accidentally put the drugs in the baby’s 3am bottle during a heroin relapse. His son, Christopher, died two days shy of his first birthday in May 2012. Happier times: Orlando Rosado is seen here with his son, Christopher, who died after drinking a bottle that his father had added methadone and heroin to . Common Pleas Judge Barbara McDermott said she based her verdict in the nonjury trial partly on Rosado’s conduct afterward, when he gave changing statements to police, including an attempt to blame the death on his five-year-old daughter.'I was appalled when I heard that,' McDermott said.Yet McDermott says she knows Rosado regrets his actions. He told police his son was 'his heart and soul.'The case opened a window into the world of two addicts, mother and father, who sought treatment after their daughter was born addicted to heroin in 2006, and were seemingly doing well. It’s at least the second case in Philadelphia in which a baby died after drinking a heroin-laced bottle.Medical records show Christopher was healthy, if small for his age, and there was no evidence of prior abuse or neglect. Photographs show the house was neatly kept, and the boy’s mother said Rosado handled the overnight feedings, and boiled water to make the formula. And a friend came every day at 7am to take him to a methadone clinic for treatment. Loved: Rosado (left, with his son) told police baby Christopher (right) was his 'heart and soul' Struggle: Both Christopher's (right) parents Orlando Rosado (left) and Crystal Miller (center) struggle with heroin addiction . Rosado told police that he fed his son Christopher at 3am on Friday May 11, . 2012 when he awoke fussy, then found the baby unresponsive in a . vomit-covered bassinet at 7am. The mother, Crystal Miller, 29, who was also in a daily methadone treatment program, said she . thought Rosado had been clean since the 2006 birth of their daughter. But . a friend who took Rosado to the methadone clinic every day said he . knew he had relapsed. The friend nonetheless said Rosado was good with . the baby, and was 'hysterical' on the morning that his son died. 'He was pretty good with the baby,' said the friend, Giovanni Nieves. Nieves knew that Rosado was still using, buying both heroin and . methadone on the street. He was also being treated for bipolar disorder. Deadly: Methadone is a synthetic opiate used in the treatment of heroin addiction . When Nieves arrived the morning of May 11, 2012, Rosado ran outside carrying his limp, discolored boy. Rosado . initially told police that he had no idea what happened, and admitted . only in a third interview, after toxicology tests came back, that he had . done eight bags of heroin after the boy’s mother went to bed. 'Can you believe he tried to blame it on [their daughter]?' Miller, crying, asked a companion after Tuesday’s verdict. Defense . lawyer Bruce Wolf argued that Rosado may have been reckless, but did . not act with malice, as is required for the third-degree verdict. But . McDermott questioned the decision to take heroin while caring for the . infant. The older child, now six, lives with Rosado’s mother and . sister, who were in the courtroom to support him but declined to comment . afterward. Fractured family: Crystal Miller (right) is no longer in a relationship with the father of her daughter, Orlando Rosado, after he killed their son (in Miller's arms) with heroin and methadone in 2012 . McDermott acquitted Rosado of drug delivery causing . death, finding there was no evidence he administered the drugs . intentionally, despite the prosecutor’s theory. 'In his warped . mind, he thought this would be OK... to make the baby sleep,' Assistant . District Attorney Lorraine Donnelly argued. A . forensic chemist testified that the baby would have ingested the drugs . within the past eight hours, based on the drugs found in his blood, . liver and urine. Tests also found evidence of heroin and methadone in . the remaining liquid in the baby bottle, which was found on a coffee . table. Tragic: Crystal Miller's son Christopher died before his first birthday; her elder daughter lives with Rosado's mother and sister . Miller testified that Rosado handled nighttime feedings while she slept, and that she did not mix the formula or prepare the bottles in advance. She said she broke off her relationship with Rosado after Christopher's death, in part because she could not get a straight answer from him about what happened that morning. But she smiled as she spoke of how he insisted on boiling tap water for Christopher's bottles if they were out of bottled water. And she described her son as 'always fussy'. Defense lawyer Bruce Wolf, perhaps pointing to his defense, asked Miller if people don't get groggy or confused after taking heroin. She agreed that can happen. Rosado, who has also been treated for bipolar disorder, attempted suicide after the boy's death.","Orlando Rosado, 46, was convicted today for the 2012 death of his infant son Christopher in a one-day trial .

"Great news for customers, but bad news for bar staff everywhere - scientists have created a barman robot that can serve waiting punters much faster and more fairly. James, named after its creator, the Joint Action in Multimodal Embodied Systems programme, has a tablet computer for a head showing big, comic-style eyes used to establish eye . contact with  customers. James' mouth moves in sync with its speech and the one-armed metal body . forming its torso is fixed behind the bar, where James accepts drink . orders, reaches for the drink using its arm and a four-fingered hand and . serves them to its customers. Scroll down for video . When it comes to the service industries, 8 per cent believe alcohol will be served up by robotic bartenders in the near future, such as James, pictured, and 3 per cent claim robots will be cooking our food. While 4 per cent believe prostitutes will be replaced by robots . It can read a customer's body . language to spot who needs to be served first, and who doesn't need or . want a drink because they're not paying attention. The . robot's behaviour is based on an earlier study by Bielefeld University . that found 90 per cent of customers deliberately face the bar. By contrast, one in 15 customers . looked at their wallets to signal that they would like to place an order . while fewer than one in 25 customers gestured at the bartender, perhaps . indicating that these are not as successful strategies. Those not needing to quench their thirst subconsciously maintained a small distance to the bar and turned away from it by chatting to friends instead, signalling to staff that they did not want service, the scientists said. Psychologist Sebastian Loth, from Bielefeld University,  claimed: . 'Effectively, the customers identify themselves as ordering and . non-ordering people through their behaviour.' The . study, published in online journal Frontiers in Psychology, looked at . recordings of customers at nightclubs in Edinburgh and Germany to . analyse how their body language attracted the bar staff’s attention. The findings formed part of pan-Europe research team that developed the bartending robot. Scientists found only one in 15 customers looked at their wallets to signal that they wanted like to place an order while fewer than one in 25 customers gestured at the bartender . The aim is to advance technology so that James can display socially intelligent behaviour that humans take for granted in daily life. Jan de Ruiter said: 'In order to respond appropriately to its customers the robot must be able to recognise human social behaviour.' James should be able to understand users who have no prior knowledge about the robot and who have not been briefed in any way. In the noisy environment of a night club, the system cannot rely on its language components alone so the robot learns how to interpret body language. German researchers said busy bar staff choose customers to serve if they are standing facing the bar or are directly in front of them, instead of whether they have cash at the ready or are snapping their fingers . Professor Ruiter added: 'Currently, we are working on the robot’s ability to recognise when a customer is bidding for its attention, thus, we have studied the process of ordering a drink in real life.' The robot requires a clear-cut definition of which signals indicate an order and which do not. Without a proper definition, it will misinterpret its customers’ signals, which could annoy people by responding inappropriately to their behaviour. The findings of the behavioral bar study were used to update James’ programming. Dr Loth said: 'With the update, James only talks to people whose position and body posture clearly indicate that they wish to order a drink. 'Only if the system is certain that the customers would like to order a drink, James will respond in Received Pronunciation ""How can I help you?"" But cutting the queue is a no-go with James. It maintains the order of the customers by memorising who came first.'","James has a tablet for a head with a camera that reads body language .

The British No 1 applauds the crowd after his victory in Valencia, he'll face Kevin Anderson in the next round . Before that Murray must find a way past South African Kevin Anderson. If the Scot can go all the way he could jump to fifth in the standings, with Tomas Berdych’s first-round loss to Pablo Andujar having boosted his chances. There was no chance of any upset on Thursday. Murray was 3-0 up after 13 minutes and had the first set in the bag within half an hour. The British No 1 broke again in the fifth game of the second set and held serve to clinch the match. Murray has yet to pick up any points in Spain for this year’s race but that will change if he overcomes Anderson, who he beat in the fourth round at Wimbledon this summer, to reach the semi-final. Murray was delighted with the win, the 27-year-old is finally finding his form again after a difficult year .

Federer has not failed to reach the final of the Swiss Indoors since 2003, but he had to fight back from a set down to see off Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. In the last eight, the 33-year-old will play fifth seed Grigor Dimitrov, who defeated Vasek Pospisil 6-2, 6-2.

Coric is at the forefront of an exciting new generation in men's tennis and he followed up his upset of Ernests Gulbis in round one by seeing off Andrey Golubev 6-4, 6-4. Nadal was the Croatian teenager's hero growing up and Coric said on the ATP website: 'I think it's going to be a great match. 'He's an unbelievable tennis player.

"Australia head coach Darren Lehmann has extended his contract by a year until June 2017. The 44-year-old has helped revive the fortunes of the Baggy Greens since taking over from Mickey Arthur in June 2013, securing a 5-0 Ashes whitewash last winter. Cricket Australia executive general manager of team performance Pat Howard said in a statement: 'We have been extremely pleased with the results Darren has achieved with the team since he came on board. Australia's head coach Darren Lehmann has signed a contract extension until June 2017 . 'He has helped create an excellent team environment that has seen players thrive. We want that to continue so we used the winter period to work through an extension to his current contract. 'Importantly, it provides continuity for the team and certainty for Darren heading into a critical period for Australian cricket.' Lehmann, whose side take on Pakistan in a two-Test series beginning in Dubai next week, will now be in charge of Australia for two more Ashes series. He said: 'I have thoroughly enjoyed the time I have had in the job and am proud of what we have achieved so far. I want to continue with the work we have done on and off the field with the team, as I feel we are heading in the right direction. Lehmann, who took over in 2013, guided Australia to a 5-0 Ashes series whitewash last winter . 'It was good to be able to sit down with Pat Howard and (CA chief executive) James Sutherland and go through where we see the team going in the next while. I'm grateful that the Board has shown faith in me to continue in the job. 'At the end of the day I will be judged by results, if the team is not performing then I am answerable. 'In the meantime, I am looking forward to this current Test series against Pakistan then getting stuck in as we lead into the biggest summer of cricket Australia has seen in a long time.'

"A baby girl is dead after the Florida Department of Children and Families failed to remove her from her drug addicted, violent parents, who had already been the subject of more than 10 reports to the state's abuse hotline. Little Emma Morrison was just 49 days old when her mother, Lisa Lamoureaux, 33, found her lifeless in her crib at around 9:30 a.m. on January 17 after putting her to sleep nine hours earlier and failing to check on her. The murky circumstances surrounding her death are still being investigated by Palm Beach County sheriff's Office and the medical examiner. Lamoureaux had a long history of drug abuse, she had been arrested nine times and her four older children had been permanently taken from her by the state, according to the Miami Herald. But the newspaper reported DCF's only action after Lamoureaux gave birth to Emma late last year was to refer her to parenting classes that she turned down or was unable to get access to. Tragic: Emma Morrison, pictured, was just 49 days old when her mother, Lisa Lamoureaux, 33, pictured left, found her lifeless in her crib on January 17, after putting her to sleep nine hours earlier and failing to check on her . Authorities also failed to ask whether the woman was still abusing drugs before deciding to leave the baby in her care. Emma's father, Dwayne Morrison, had an even more worrying past. The 48-year-old had been arrested 35 times since 1992 with charges including kidnapping, robbery, battery, aggravated battery on a pregnant woman, fraud, contempt of court, escape, and drug charges, the Herald reported. Records show the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office had made 'numerous' calls to the home Lamoureaux shared with Morrison and, while the woman was pregnant with Emma, he had been the subject of two domestic battery calls and was arrested twice. But on both occasions, Lamoureaux dropped charges against him. On December 13, the mother called the DCF's abuse and neglect hotline after Morrison slapped her in the face while she was holding the newborn, but, as in the past, she dropped the charges and Morrison was released from jail. History: Lamoureaux, left, had a long history of drug abuse and Emma's father Dwayne Morrison, right, had been arrested 35 times. Neither have been charged in Emma's death as the investigation continues . The Herald reported that DCF referred the case to three service providers and then stopped monitoring the family. But none of the programs - Family Preservation Services, Boys' Town and Triple P Parenting - had a chance to act before Emma's tragic death. DCF spokesman Joe Follick told the Herald that it was 'very easy for others to indulge in hindsight second-guessing.' 'The threshold is very high for the state to remove a child from his or her mother, especially when there are no clear signs of imminent danger or abuse,' he said. 'The reality of making decisions on separating an infant from his or her mother is a much more complex process that every employee at the department takes very seriously.' He added that every death 'affects us deeply' but refused to release any details on the investigation surrounding Emma's death. Failings: The state failed to remove the child despite Lamoureaux's four other children being taken off her and the couple's previous drug abuse and arrests . 'We have reviewed the history of this family and the investigation of this case. It would be entirely premature and reckless to speculate on the cause of death while local authorities investigate,' he told the newspaper. After a similarly harrowing infant death in 2008, Florida introduced a policy called the Ludwig Protocol that requires DCF staff to look closely at infants born to parents already being investigated for abuse or neglect. But in a January 24 email, DCF's top child welfare attorney, Mary Cagle acknowledged that the protocol had been overlooked in this case. The investigators 'never set a Ludwig staffing with (Children's Legal Services) before the baby was born... as is required,' Cagle wrote, according to the Herald. The newspaper quoted a review that found any record of Emma's mother's history of drug abuse was 'missing' from her file as was the family's long history with DCF - her parents had at least 11 prior contacts with the department. It said that 'there is not an assessment of the (agency's prior history with the family) or criminal history' in any records before the little girl's sad death. Neither Lamoureaux or Morrison has been charged in Emma's death and the investigation into what happened is continuing.","Little Emma Morrison was just 49 days old when she died on January 17 .

"Wigan have assured Ben Flower his job is safe despite the Wales prop’s six-month ban for punching Lance Hohaia of St Helens in the Grand Final. Flower will miss 13 games for the attack that left Wigan a man short for 78 minutes of Super League’s showpiece game - which St Helens won 14-6 at Old Trafford on Saturday. But Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan dismissed suggestions that Flower, 26, could be sacked for his moment of madness. Ref Phil Bentham shows a red card to Wigan prop Ben Flower during Saturday's Grand Final at Old Trafford . Flower knocked St Helens stand-off Lance Hohaia to the ground and punched him again just two minutes in . ‘There is absolutely no question of us sacking Ben Flower,’ said Lenagan. ‘Ben made a mistake, and let anyone who hasn’t made a mistake stand forward. This is not drug taking, it’s behaving irresponsibly in a super-charged emotional environment. ‘That’s no reason to sack a player. That’s a reason to discipline him and make sure he suffers from it because we as a club have suffered as well obviously, and quite rightly so because we are responsible for our players. ‘A six-month ban is exceptional and the public criticism of Ben has hurt him very hard, rightly though.’ Flower has since been given a six-month suspension for the incident in Saturday's final at Old Trafford . Greater Manchester Police are continuing to investigate death threats made against Flower on Twitter. Lenagan said: 'I think death threats are crazy in the circumstances, when the victim himself is making clear his position. You always get extremists, particularly associated with sport.' Hohaia has said he holds no ill feeling towards Flower.","Ben Flower has been given assurances by Wigan that he won't be sacked .

"Mikko Ilonen became the first Finnish player to win the Volvo World Match Play Championship on Sunday after a hard-fought victory over top seed Henrik Stenson at The London Club. Ilonen carded four birdies and no bogeys despite the windy conditions to win 3&1 and secure the first prize of €650,000 (£515,000), almost double his previous biggest payday from winning the Irish Open in June. Stenson, who had not led at any stage of his morning semi-final against George Coetzee before making a birdie on the 18th to win, claimed an early lead in the final with a birdie on the fourth. Mikko Ilonen has won the Volvo World Match Play Championship after defeating Henrik Stenson . However, the world number five then bogeyed the fifth and hit his tee shot into the water on the eighth, before birdies on the 10th and 12th took Ilonen three up. Stenson, still seeking his first win since the DP World Tour Championship in November last year which meant he became the first man to win the FedEx Cup and Race to Dubai in the same season, refused to throw in the towel and birdied the 13th to reduce his deficit. But after almost holing his chip from the back of the 14th green, the Swede could only look on as Ilonen holed from 12 feet for birdie to move three ahead again, this time with just four holes remaining. Stenson fought back once more with a two-putt birdie on the par-five 15th, but was unable to birdie either of the next two holes as Ilonen - who had beaten Joost Luiten 2&1 in the semi-finals - secured the biggest win of his career.

"Australian Scott Hend edged Angelo Que in a play-off to clinch his maiden European Tour title at the Hong Kong Open. A par on the first extra hole was enough to steer the 41-year-old past the Filipino, who missed the green on the 18th and then over-hit his chip. Que's fourth-round 66 forced the play-off after an intense back-nine battle, which ended with his birdie on the 18th tying things up with Hend at 13 under par. Hend holds the trophy aloft after completing his first win on the European Tour at the age of 41 . The Australian consoles Angelo Que after beating the Filipino on an 18th hole play-off in Honk Kong . But the 35-year-old will be left lamenting the fact that his three bogeys on the day - to Hend's two - and a costly second-round 69 ultimately cost him victory. Aged 41, Hend is the oldest first-time European Tour title winner since Cesar Monasterio, who was 42 when he won the 2006 As St Omer Open. He was understandably thrilled to secure victory, but he felt bad for Que after his bogey sealed the play-off. ""I felt quite calm, the only thing is that hole at the end you never want to have a go at the pin because you can make a bogey quite easily so I wasn't really sure how to play it,"" Hend told the European Tour website. Herd became the oldest man to win his maiden Tour title since Cesar Monasterio in 2006 . Que played well to force a play-off but will regret his three bogeys in a round of 66 that left him on 13 under . ""Unfortunately Angelo made a bogey, I would have rather one of us made a birdie because he's a great guy and it would be nice to earn the win on a positive note. But I'll take the win and I'm ecstatic."" Overnight leader Marcus Fraser's double bogey on the opening hole blew the title race open and he struggled to get back in the mix with back-to-back bogeys on the 14th and 15th holes. The 35-year-old also bogeyed the play-off hole, meaning Herd's par was enough to take the title . Irishman Kevin Phelan had more success on the back nine, hitting three birdies in a row from the 16th to the 18th, but he finished on 11 under - two shots behind Hend and Que. Englishman Mark Foster's double-bogey on the ninth dented his progress and he finished one shot behind Phelan, while Fraser ended up in a four-strong cluster four shots off the pace after a disappointing final round of 72.","Australian pars extra hole to become oldest first-time winner in eight years .

"Somebody has to win the NFC South. That's the message from Atlanta running back Steven Jackson as the 2-5 Falcons prepare for their clash with the Detroit Lions at Wembley on Sunday. Atlanta are not the only team struggling in that division. The Carolina Panthers currently lead the way on 3-3-1 with the New Orleans Saints (2-4) in second, the Falcons third and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1-5) fourth. 'We are only seven weeks in,' Jackson told Sportsmail. 'If somebody goes on a winning streak and wins their next nine games, they have a winning record. It is all about the team who are going to rectify their wrongs and go and take the division. We feel in Atlanta, why not us because someone has to win the division.' Steven Jackson (left) thinks the Atlanta Falcons can still claw their way back into contention in the NFC South . Jackson at an event at NikeTown on Tuesday . As if injury problems with their offensive line weren't enough to deal with, the Falcons will come up against the best defense in the league on Sunday against the Lions. Detroit enter the game in a different place - 5-2 atop the NFC North having just pulled off a thrilling 24-23 win over the New Orleans Saints. Jackson said: 'Detroit have had a very good first half of the season. Their skill players are some of the best in the National Football League along with a very tenacious, nasty defense led by Ndumakong Suh. 'It is unfortunate that a lot of my team mates have been injured. The offensive line has been decimated by injuries. Typically your offensive line is the nucleus of the team. They are the backbone, the big, tough guys who protect everyone around them and allow the smaller, skilled athletes to do their job well. 'When you have so many injuries and then change up with guys trying to get not only used to each other and build that chemistry together but a game plan as well, it can be really challenging in the middle of a season.' The Falcons landed at Gatwick Airport on Monday morning and will begin their practice for the week at Arsenal's London Colney base on Wednesday. The foreign country and different environment may have an effect on some of the younger players in the league, but Jackson is experienced enough to be able to deal with the demands of playing a regular-season game in London and the distractions that may bring to a business trip. Jackson (second from left) joined Ndamukong Suh (second from right) and Joey Barton on stage at NikeTown . The Atlanta Falcons cheerleaders make an appearance at Wolves' clash with Middlesbrough at Molineux . But, even as an experienced traveller, Jackson admitted it would be tough for players if the NFL moves a franchise to London. He said: 'Personally I know the difference between taking care of business and doing my part as an individual and I know how to balance the two. It would be harder for the younger guys. 'Outside of Los Angeles, England is the only other place where I see that it really makes sense to introduce a new franchise. 'The NFL season is grueling on it's own so to have 10 or 12-hour flights would be really challenging on certain teams. The London based team may have to be away from home for two or three weeks at a time and it could be quite a disadvantage. Ndamukong Suh, Steven Jackson and Joey Barton were at NikeTown London as part of the 'Suit up for Sunday' campaign and ahead of the second 2014 NFL International Series game.

"Silverstone, the home of British motor racing, is in turmoil after the suspension of three directors, including managing director Richard Phillips. Sportsmail understands the three executives were suspended last week and will remain on full pay until an investigation has been completed. The upheaval comes as businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who was ‘entrepreneur in residence’ to the government, leads a significant review into how Silverstone operates. The British Racing Drivers Club are taking a closer role into running Silverstone, with Lewis Hamilton (above) seen driving past the BRDC stand at the circuit at the British Grand Prix this year . The British Racing Drivers’ Club, who own Silverstone, confirmed in an internal statement sent to its members: ‘The BRDC are taking a closer role in the running of the Silverstone business, with a new operating structure between the Club and the circuit. ‘John Grant, chairman of the BRDC, and Lawrence Tomlinson, director of the BRDC, have assumed the role of joint acting chief executive of Silverstone Circuits Limited (SCL). ‘Having reviewed the Silverstone business, they have embarked on an exciting programme of restructuring to make the business more streamlined, concentrating on their core competencies as a circuit operator and the home of the British Grand Prix. ‘Whilst we cannot comment on the suspension of senior executives at SCL, it should be noted that this is only coincidental to the restructure.’ Phillips has been managing director for 10 years. He previously worked at Brands Hatch and on other sporting projects including the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Silverstone managing director Richard Phillips has been suspended as he shows off the current configuration of the Northampton based circuit . The new paddock and pit complex including the wing has played a role in Silverstone's recent losses . Despite Silverstone securing a 17-year contract to host F1 in 2010 – at annual cost of about £15million – the need to secure the circuit’s long-term viability remains a challenge. The building of a new paddock and pit complex has meant Silverstone has made net losses of £5.8m over the last three years. With Bernie Ecclestone taking TV, advertising and corporate money, ticket sales are virtually the circuit’s only money-making opportunity during Formula One grand prix weekends. The BRDC, comprising 850 important motor-racing figures, have been looking to sell Silverstone, but drew a line under those plans earlier this year, with chairman Neil England resigning in July to make way for Tomlinson. Since then MotoGP have announced their annual race will be leaving Silverstone from next year to be held at Donington in the interim before supposedly moving to the Circuit of Wales, a new track near Ebbw Vale that is being backed by the devolved assembly in Cardiff. Meanwhile, Silverstone continue to look at fresh revenue-generating schemes, including the long-cherished idea of building a hotel on their Northamptonshire site. Tomlinson, who joined the BRDC board in August, is ranked 151st in the Sunday Times Rich List with an estimated fortune of £550m. A Yorkshireman, he owns Ginetta Cars Ltd and won the GT2 class at Le Mans in 2006. The British Racing Drivers' club announced on October 20 in an internal statement to their members that they had started the restructuring of Sliverstone Circuits (SCL) organisation.","Richard Phillips one of three executives who were suspended last week .

"Opinion aims to kick start a glorious international campaign for owners Highclere Thoroughbreds when he lines up in Saturday’s Moonee Valley Cup in Australia. Victory for the colt, who won the 2013 Duke Of Edinburgh Handicap at Royal Ascot when trained by Sir Michael Stoute, will guarantee a start in the biggest race Down Under on November 4, two days after Highclere’s Stoute-trained Hardwicke Stakes winner and King George runner-up Telescope contests the Breeders’ Cup Turf at Santa Anita in California.

"Ian Poulter has slammed Sir Nick Faldo for calling Sergio Garcia ‘useless’ during the Ryder Cup and claimed he has lost the respect of Europe’s top golfers. Poulter revealed the home locker room was fuming about the remark and said Faldo had gone from being his hero to zero. He accused him of sour grapes and being embittered because he is the only losing European Ryder Cup captain this century. The colourful Englishman made his strong remarks in his autobiography ‘No Limits,’ released this week. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rory McIlroy and the European Ryder cup team revel in victory . Ian Poulter and Sergio Garcia celebrate Europe’s Ryder Cup win this year . The demand for a fleeting moment of television fame is partly responsible for the deterioration in crowd behaviour at Ryder Cups, claims Ian Poulter. 'Guys are trying to get themselves heard on TV – that’s what it is. It’s somebody thinking, I am going to go to a golf tournament today and I’m going to shout ‘Me nan wears pants’. It’s really not very clever.' Poulter is highly critical of American crowds after Europe’s Ryder Cup victory at Medinah. He says: 'I’m all for atmosphere in golf and the crowd getting involved, but there’s a line to be tread and occasionally things are said too early.' He describes someone yelling 'Get in the hole' on a 500-yard par five as 'very stupid'. He suggests: 'Hit the fairway' would be more helpful but the bray 'Baba booey' has no relevance. The most mystifying unrelated golf shout is 'mashed potato'. Poulter warns: 'If you are concentrating on a shot and someone screams on your backswing, it is off-putting. It has the potential to affect the outcome of a match or tournament.' Faldo, in his capacity as an American television commentator, was asked during the first day of the Ryder Cup about Garcia and referred back to his own time as captain in 2008, saying the Spaniard had had a ‘bad attitude’ and had been ‘useless’. Faldo claimed later the remark was in ‘semi-jest’ before conceding that ‘useless’ had been a poor choice of word. ‘“Lousy” would have been better,’ he added. Garcia was ill at Valhalla in 2008 and also love-sick after splitting from his long-term girlfriend, Greg Norman’s daughter Morgan-Leigh. In his book, Poulter takes up the story at Gleneagles from the players’ perspective. They are buzzing after a brilliant fightback in the afternoon foursomes to take a 5-3 first day lead. ‘There is only one negative,’ writes Poulter. ‘At the press conference, it emerges Nick Faldo has been heavily critical of Sergio Garcia. He has said Sergio had a bad attitude when he played under Nick in the 2008 Ryder Cup and that he was “useless” there. ‘Sergio puts a brave face on it but the rest of the guys are fuming. I’m shocked that he has said it. It’s highly disrespectful. It’s a cheap shot and it’s the worst possible timing. ‘It makes me laugh. Faldo is talking about someone being useless at the 2008 Ryder Cup. That’s the Ryder Cup where he was captain. That’s the Ryder Cup where the Europe team suffered a heavy defeat. Sir Nick Faldo angered many of Europe's top golfers by calling Garcia ‘useless’ during the Ryder Cup . ‘And he was captain. So who’s useless? Faldo might need to have a little look in the mirror. I have always got on great with Faldo in the past and I have a great deal of respect for everything he has achieved but this feels like sour grapes. It feels like a guy who is still bitter that he lost in 2008. ‘Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of what he said. There were plenty of things a lot of the players were unhappy with at Valhalla but none of us criticised him. He may find that begins to change now.’ Faldo is not the only captain who comes under fire. Some of American skipper Tom Watson’s strange decisions come under scrutiny. ‘By the end of the second day we have a 10-6 lead,’ says Poulter. ‘Ecstatic as we are, quite a few of us are surprised by Watson’s decision-making during Saturday’s play. Most of all I’m astonished he does not play Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley. Garcia was love-sick after splitting from long-term girlfriend, Greg Norman’s daughter Morgan-Leigh in 2008 . ‘He leaves them out of both sessions. It completely baffles me. It gives us a double boost because it tells us there are problems in the US team room. ‘Watson’s choices mean seven of his players play 36 holes on Saturday. I find it hard to see the sense in that. Some of them look shattered and Paul McGinley’s strategy starts to pay off. We’re fresh. We keep coming at them. Wave after wave after wave.’ Poulter talks about partnering home hero Stephen Gallacher against Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed on the opening morning and admits he was not cut out for the role of big brother. ‘I find it hard taking on the responsibility of helping a rookie,’ he says. ‘I’m nervous, too. I want to win for him as much as myself and the team but we get humped 5&4.’ Poulter played the following morning alongside Rory McIlroy. At the 15th hole, the Ryder Cup finally gets its first taste of that old Poulter magic as he chips in for a birdie to win the hole and help secure a half against Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler. He admits he was disappointed not to partner his old mate Justin Rose in the afternoon foursomes. ‘Paul has decided to go with Martin (Kaymer) and tells me if I had made that chip shot 15 minutes earlier I’d have been playing,’ he says.

The City manager reckons his Argentine midfielder has the knowledge to help the Foxes to victory at Swansea on Saturday. They go to the Liberty Stadium in the Barclays Premier League after one point from their last three games. Leicester midfielder Esteban Cambiasso could feature against Swansea on Saturday evening . Cambiasso, pictured after scoring against Man United, has made an instant impression in the Premier League . Stoke 0-1 Leicester . Leicester 5-3 Manchester United . Crystal Palace 2-0 Leicester . Newcastle 1-0 Leicester . Cambiasso won the Champions League and five Serie A titles before arriving on a free transfer from Inter Milan over the summer. And Pearson knows the 34-year-old can play a crucial part for the Foxes. 'He's settled in well and it's been a very positive impact,' he said. 'Experience is difficult to quantify over the course of the season but he has an unbelievable amount and I'm sure that will play a very important role over the season. 'Whether he plays or is on the bench it is fair to say he has an important impact on the group. 'Without going into the selection situation for the weekend it's good to have a squad which is available.' Former Inter Milan ace Cambiasso has scored one goal in four games since joining the Foxes in the summer . Leicester manager Nigel Pearson, pictured taking Thursday's training session, will be hoping his side can get back to winning ways when they face Swansea on Saturday . Pearson's opposite number Garry Monk was contacted by the Football Association this week to 'seek his observations' following comments he made about Victor Moses and referee Michael Oliver in the 2-1 defeat to Stoke on Saturday. They are yet to decide whether to take disciplinary action against Monk after he accused Moses of cheating to win a penalty. He also alleged Oliver made a 'disgusting decision' in awarding the spot-kick. But Pearson would not be drawn on the subject, ahead of facing Monk in south Wales. 'I wouldn't dream of advising other managers, it's not my position to do that,' he said. 'It's an emotional game and we have all be in that situation before. 'I wouldn't think that Garry would want my advice on anything. He is the manager of Swansea and deserves the right to manage there. He will manage in his own style. How people deal with situations is up to them.'","Nigel Pearson has hailed Esteban Cambiasso's importance .

"Romelu Lukaku has revealed that he feels 'blessed' to be working with strike partner Samuel Eto'o at Everton. The Toffees pair both signed from Chelsea in the summer, but did not bring a ready-made partnership due to Lukaku spending the majority of last season on loan at Goodison Park. The Belgian forward's club record £28million price tag - and a lengthy list of rival suitors - might have made him Everton's marquee arrival, but Eto'o's free transfer appears an equally sound piece of business.

Lukaku strikes with his right for to put Everton ahead against Burnley in the Premier League on Sunday . Eto'o's stunning curled effort ensured Everton's three points late on... the goal was his second of the afternoon . The veteran, arguably Europe's most feared goalscorer during his time at Barcelona, rolled back the years against Burnley on Sunday, netting a bullet header and classy long-ranger. They were his third and fourth of the season but Lukaku, who was also on target in a 3-1 win at Turf Moor, believes Eto'o's value as a mentor is just as important. 'He's a world class player. He's scored so many goals throughout his career and I've been blessed to be working with him,' said Lukaku. 'I spend most of the time with him. I come in at the same time as he does, I leave at the same time. We do everything together on and off the pitch as well. 'In training we have a finishing competition and the one who loses has to do sprints. Eto'o sticks out his tongue in celebration after his second goal at Turf Moor put the game beyond Burnley . Lukaku says he and Eto'o spend a lot of time together and are both enjoying life at Goodison Park . 'We see each other quite often. He comes to my house, I go to his house. I try to learn as much as I can from him and he tells me stories about how he worked when he was younger.' Lukaku has not been short of decorated senior figures to learn from during his time in England and he has set his sights on making a name of his own that will rival the very best. 'Samuel has the same impact as (Didier) Drogba and (Nicolas) Anelka had on me when I was younger at Chelsea,' he said. 'In that aspect I think I've been blessed to work with top strikers like them. I hope to be one of them in the future.' Lukaku (right) celebrates with team-mate Seamus Coleman after scoring to put Everton 2-1 up at Turf Moor . The 21-year-old still has a way to go before he can bracketed with those stellar performers, but his potential remains huge. His goal against the Clarets, an untidy but effective finish, was just his fourth in 15 appearances this term - a mark he had already reached after four games last year. 'It was a slow start but now I'm getting where I want to be,' he said. 'I've scored back-to-back Premier League goals now so I only want to look forward. 'I'm working very hard and I'm almost at 100 per cent. I think the best has yet to come. 'I put myself under pressure, I really want to succeed and I really want to help my team-mates and the club by scoring goals, by winning games.

"Steven Taylor’s contribution to Newcastle’s winless start to the Premier League season amounted to little more than 60 seconds. Seven games without victory, United were adrift in the relegation places with their long-serving defender having warmed the bench for the majority. Now, on the back of maximum returns against Leicester and Spurs, the Magpies are up to 14th and manager Alan Pardew’s job is safe. Steven Taylor has played for Newcastle United for the last eleven years - since he was 16 years old . The former England Under 21 captain has found first team appearances hard to come by of late . Taylor has played every minute of those victories but was only recalled in the wake of an injury to Mike Williamson. The starting XI, however, is where the 28-year-old intends to stay and, when asked if he now deserved his place in the side, Taylor shot back: ‘Absolutely. The one thing I’ve done is waited for my chance and kept myself in good shape. ‘I’ve taken my chance and that’s what I had to do – we’ve got three points in both games. ‘One hundred per cent (I intend to stay in the side). I love my football and there’s nothing better than playing in front of 52,000 fans, that’s where I want to be.’ Since an injury to Mike Williamson though, Taylor has rejoined the Newcastle back-line for two wins in a row . Taylor (left) insists that he wants to make the position his own, as Newcastle moved up to 16th on Sunday . Taylor, the former England Under-21 captain, was sent off on the opening day of last season following a reckless elbow on Sergio Aguero during a 4-0 defeat at Manchester City. Pardew lost faith in the centre-back following that dismissal and he appeared just nine times in the league during the remainder of the campaign. And, ahead of tomorrow’s return to the Etihad Stadium, Taylor reflected: ‘It’s horrible (being out of the team). You’ve just got to knuckle down and work hard and make sure you take that chance when it comes. Now, I’m feeling full of confidence. ‘But the rest of the lads have been fantastic and it’s been a real team effort these past two games.’ Taylor is not one to shirk from danger - pictured here (second left) putting his body on the line against Leicester . Taylor (second left) celebrates with team-mates Paul Dummett and Tim Krul after Sunday's win against Spurs . Taylor prefers not to talk about his red card but believes United travel to City for their Capital One Cup fourth-round tie in good spirits. ‘If you win games you are confident,’ he said, Sammy Ameobi and Ayoze Perez having got the second-half goals during Sunday’s 2-1 win at Spurs. ‘We have that belief to stay in a game even when we are not playing well. ‘We did not play that well in the first half (at Spurs) even though we created a few chances. ‘But we had no fear - you cannot playing with fear when you go to White Hart Lane. Taylor (centre) looked delighted at the full-time whistle against Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday . Taylor's first game back after Mike Williamson's injury coincided with Newcastle's first win of the season . ‘I thought we were fantastic in the second half. We really stuck at it. They had one shot maybe. When you come to Tottenham that doesn’t ever happen. ‘In the second half only one team was in it. We have creativity in the side and Sammy Ameobi was a breath of fresh air for us. He showed that. ‘And it was great for Ayoze Perez to get his goal. He is a goalscorer, put the ball in front of him and he has that ability. ‘We are now looking forward to City. It will be tough game, we know that, but we will cause them problems.’","Steven Taylor has not been a fixture in Newcastle's back-line this season .

"Sadio Mane scored the winning goal for Southampton against Stoke. It was his second goal in as many weeks for the Saints, here Sportsmail gives the lowdown on the Senegal midfielder. Who is he? A fleet-footed wide player signed by Ronald Koeman for £11.8 million on deadline day to help mitigate the mass player exodus at Southampton. Sadio Mane celebrates his goal with Southampton manager Ronald Koeman . What’s his story? Born in Sedhiou, Senegal, on April 10 1992, Mane joined French side Metz’s famous academy in 2011. The promising youngster transferred to Red Bull Salzburg in 2012, where he scored 29 league goals in two seasons, before electing to join Koeman’s Saints revolution after Salzburg were eliminated from the Champions League. Mane scored for Southampton against Stoke and against Sunderland last week . Type of player? Despite being right-footed, Mane’s preferred position is on the left, where he utilises his blistering pace and deceptive strength to good effect - as Phil Bardsley discovered on Saturday. His ability to swing crosses in from the byline on his left foot, combined with a proficiency in front of goal when cutting in on his right, make him very difficult to defend against.","Southampton signed Sadio Mane from Salzburg for £11.8m on deadline day .

"Vincent Tan has softened in his stance over the future of League Managers’ Association chief executive Richard Bevan. The Cardiff City owner insists he no longer wants him to resign over his mishandling of the Malky Mackay ‘textgate’ scandal. The Malaysian billionaire (below) was furious with Bevan after the LMA dismissed an exchange of racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic and sexist emails and text messages between Mackay and Iain Moody as ‘banter’ when the two were colleagues at Cardiff. Cardiff owner Vincent Tan has withdrawn calls for LMA chief Richard Bevan to resign . Bevan (R), pictured here with David Moyes, dismissed completely inappropriate texts and emails as 'banter' On the day Sportsmail’s revelations led to the resignation of Moody as director of football at Crystal Palace and persuaded Palace to pull the plug on plans to appoint Mackay as their new manager, Cardiff responded by calling for Bevan’s resignation. By then the LMA had issued a public apology for their ‘inappropriate’ original statement. But at the time it did little to placate an understandably angry Tan. Asked about his call for Bevan to stand down during an interview with Sky Sports, when he also suggested he might yet sell Cardiff to buy ‘another club in the UK’, Tan said: ‘I would say that maybe we sound a bit harsh, but when you are angry sometimes you can say harsh words. So if you ask me “do I want him to resign?”, maybe not really we want him to resign.’ Malky Mackay lost the chance of becoming Crystal Palace manager after texts were exposed by Sportsmail . Tan did urge Bevan not to trivialise such issues in the future, however. ‘Now I would say “Mr Bevan, I don’t really want you to resign but you should take this more seriously”.’ Tan also insisted he had ‘no personal vendetta’ against Mackay, who was sacked as manager of Cardiff in December last year amid concerns over eight transfers. The texts and emails were discovered as part of a Tan-funded investigation into those transfers and, in particular, a raid on the house of former Cardiff head of recruitment Moody. The Eagles also sacked director of football Iain Moody (C) for his part in the scandal . Tan claims that should Russell Slade become the next Cardiff manager, it will be the first appointment that he has been responsible for . But Tan said it was ‘nothing personal’ with Mackay. ‘There is no personal vendetta,’ he said. ‘This is business. I hardly know him. I didn’t recruit him.’ Tan said he was not responsible for the appointment of Dave Jones or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, either, claiming that Russell Slade will be his first appointment once an issue has been resolved with Slade’s previous club, Leyton Orient. ‘I say now, this next manager, I must like him,’ said Tan before stressing how important it was that he can ‘trust’ his manager. He did admit he might ‘make suggestions’ on team selection even if he insisted Slade would pick the team.","Vincent Tan no longer wants LMA chief Richard Bevan to resign .

"Southampton fans sang ‘We’re going to win the league’, and were only half joking after this victory. Manager Ronald Koeman encouraged their optimism, suggesting his side could be playing in the Champions League next season. Victory propelled Southampton ahead of Premier League title holders Manchester City to second in the table, with 19 points from nine games. Their only hiccups so far have been a scoreless draw against West Bromwich Albion and away defeats by Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur. Koeman said their league position, just four points behind leaders Chelsea, did not flatter his side. ‘You can make up your own mind, but up to now maybe we deserve more points,’ he said. ‘We lost at Liverpool when we deserved more, and maybe you can say the same when we lost at Tottenham.’ Southampton manager Ronald Koeman celebrates his sides 1-0 win over Stoke at full time . Koeman, who many thought would struggle to match Southampton’s eighth-placed finish under Mauricio Pochettino last season, thinks a top-four spot is eminently possible. He said: ‘When I look at the other teams around the top four, City have a great team, Chelsea are probably the most complete side at the moment, but the rest of them have not shown that they have a better team than us. ‘Maybe there is an opportunity for us because Arsenal and Liverpool have a tough programme with Champions League football, but they do have 25 or 26 players in their squads who are all internationals. Koeman had special praise for Toby Alderweireld who played a key role in Southampton's win over Stoke . ‘We don’t have that luxury, maybe that is one difference between us. Ronald Koeman’s new-look Southampton have won all five of their Premier League games in which they have scored first. ‘It’s too early to say what we would like to win this season. When expectations are high, the best solution is to live day by day. ‘We enjoy being second in the table but it is only a start.’ Koeman said Southampton were no longer a surprise package after consistently proving themselves as an inventive but well-disciplined side, one that can put eight past Sunderland but has also conceded fewer goals than any other in the top four divisions. Sadio Mane (not pictured) scored the winning goal past Stoke's Asmir Begovic . The new signings Koeman made after the summer exodus again proved their worth. Senegal midfielder Sadio Mane, bought from Red Bull Salzburg for £11.8m in the summer, confidently scored from a rebound to put Southampton ahead after 33 minutes. Mane, who had a strike against Sunderland harshly taken from him by the dubious goals panel, terrorised Phil Bardsley down the left flank before scoring his first official goal for Saints. Southampton climbed above Manchester City in the Premier League and dreaming of a top four spot . Again, Southampton were regimented at the back, proving they are not the meanest defence in the league by accident. Koeman singled out Belgian loan signing Toby Alderweireld, who lifted the La Liga title with Atletico Madrid last season, for praise. The Dutchman said Alderweireld was helping Southampton’s defence play like the best in the world. ‘He has been a strong influence - he has settled so well that it looks as if he has played in English football for two years already,’ said Koeman. ‘Last season he was playing for Atletico Madrid, who probably had the best defence in Europe, and before that he was at Ajax. He has learned a lot about the game at a high level.’ Mark Hughes, whose Stoke side were disappointing and missed a few chances to level in the second half, said Southampton were a good blueprint for other clubs. ‘If you look back over the years Southampton have spent big money on kids and that is why they are reaping the benefits of it,’ he said, . ‘Stoke haven’t had the benefit of that but in the future, given the investment of (owners) the Coates family into the club we will get a return on that money without a shadow of a doubt, but it will take time.’","Southampton's win over Stoke was their sixth in the last 10 games .

"This article was originally published in Scottish Daily Mail on Saturday, August 23. First a declaration. Malky Mackay is a man I have known and liked for 16 years. To describe him as a personal friend would be stretching things but you take people as you find them. In football, players are quick to take umbrage at negative writeups but, in 20 years as a journalist, Mackay remains the only one ever to utter a thank-you for a good one. Exclusive: Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton's broke the story in the Daily Mail on Thursday, August 21 . Revelation: How Sportsmail broke the story of Mackay and Iain Moody's text message exchanges . Sorry: Mackay issued a poorly-worded statement through the League Managers Association . In May, our professional acquaintance, stretching back to his days as a Celtic defender, prompted an invitation to the annual Scottish football writers' awards dinner. Mackay and his father couldn't make it. If he had, some of those hammering him now would have been quick to shake his hand. There comes a time, of course, when you simply cannot defend the indefensible. Text messages of a gravely ill-judged, offensive nature have left Mackay clinging to his personal and professional reputation. His career is on the line. People now ask openly if he can possibly hope to return to frontline management, while those of us who have always regarded him as a thoroughly decent man have a sense of unease over recent revelations. Ten of the 12 shocking text messages exposed by this newspaper were sent by former Cardiff colleague Iain Moody. Of 10,000 communications found on Moody's computer, Mackay last night admitted sending three. And three is too many. One referred to 'fkn chinkys' in relation to his South Korean signing Kim Bo-Kyung. It was crass and degrading. Another concerned football agent, Phil Smith, and was hurtful and anti-Semitic in nature. Success: Cardiff owner Tan celebrates Cardiff's Championship title victory with Mackay in 2013 . To a public who previously regarded him as a solid citizen, Mackay is now tarnished. But the fact the texts are grossly at odds with his public persona make this a disturbingly sad story. In a bid to stem the loss of blood, the League Managers Association issued a statement on Mackay's behalf. 'I'm sorry' might have sufficed but, instead, the texts were described by the usually slick LMA as 'friendly text-message banter'. A poorer choice of words is hard to imagine. It suggested a casual, almost complacent, approach to racism in British football. The LMA were, quite rightly, apologising for their apology. There is now a long line of critics setting their sights on Mackay. Some branded him an 'abhorrent individual'. The vast majority of whom have never met him. Out of the game: Moody (left) and Mackay have both since left their jobs in football . Shock: Moody, Crystal Palace's director of football and Mackay's former colleague, was also reported . Let's be clear. There shouldn't be a person anywhere who thinks these texts deserve anything other than the deepest condemnation. The Glaswegian's exchanges with Iain Moody were at the extreme end of the scale, no question. They will plague him for the rest of his days. Just ask Ron Atkinson. Sacked last December, the former Celtic defender's first mistake was to become more popular than Cardiff owner Vincent Tan. His second was to pursue him for compensation. Tan appeared to win that spat in May when Mackay issued an 'unreserved apology' for his role in his own sacking and dropped his compensation claim against the club. From there, the Scot hoped both parties could move on. But Tan is clearly not a man to either forgive or forget. Read it here first! How Sportsmail broke the news over Malky Mackay's text shame . Mea culpa: Mackay apologised live on Sky Sports News after Sportsmail's revelations . He appears to have held the worst of the texts back as a loaded gun. And he fired the bullet in a missive to the Football Association the day before Mackay planned to become the new manager of Crystal Palace. A coincidence? Possibly. But the problem for Mackay is that Tan is beginning to look like a wronged party in all of this. Like a reformed campaigner shining a light on the seedy underbelly of racism, sexism and homophobia in British football. A cynic might see him as something else. They may see a rich man with a grudge who is nursing a vengeful desire to settle old scores and get his way at any cost. A dangerous adversary hellbent on destroying Mackay while taking Richard Bevan, the chief of the LMA, down as well. Under fire: Richard Bevan, chief of the LMA, was criticised for his poorly worded aplogy . If you were to chose an enemy, you certainly wouldn't start with Vincent Tan. You would pay a penny for current Cardiff manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's thoughts right now. You would pay substantially more for Malky Mackay's. He broke cover to offer up his apology. For the sake of his blameless young family and the people slighted by an ugly episode, it was the least he could do. Time will tell if it was enough. Tortured Gazza's demise makes painful viewing . The life of Paul Gascoigne has become a heart-rending tragedy. A slow moving train wreck increasingly likely to end in tears. Ours, not his. To supporters of Rangers, Newcastle United, England — even Celtic — the latest images on Mail Online of a once brilliant footballer are depressing, worrying and grim. Clutching a bottle of gin, the former England international was captured, eyes half shut, face swollen, being led from his Dorset home by police. In one picture, he sat head in hands, looking older than his 47 years. Led away: Paul Cascoigne is escorted from his home by police to an ambulance . Some pictures require no caption. The bleak truth is that Gazza is an alcoholic. He is ill. Last September, when dry, he spoke in a television documentary of his fears that he might start drinking again. The fears proved depressingly well-founded. At the time, he spent his money on botox to counter the effects of the drinking and was spending £1,000 a year on cosmetic injections. This is how it goes. Whatever Gascoigne does, he does to extremes. At one point, football was his high of choice. At Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio and Rangers, he was a mesmerising talent. The rights and wrongs of how Rangers financed their signings during the David Murray era are a source of lingering bitterness. But the sight of Gascoigne in the Scottish league added colour to a black and white scene. The problem was always going to come when the curtain fell and the floodlights dimmed. Early promise: Paul Gascoigne in action for Newcastle against Tranmere in 1988 . For a book on football's flawed geniuses, his former manager, Walter Smith, once told me: 'Those of us who knew Paul thought it was always going to be a problem once they took away the focal point of his life — the football. 'If he had been able to train for 16 to 18 hours a day, then come back the next day, he would have been happy.' That's not how life works, of course. Eventually, even the fittest of men — those free of addiction and tortured nights — must hang up their boots. And for most, it's the worst experience of their life. The lifestyle, which sustained them on the straight and narrow, is bent out of all recognition. The lucky ones find solace in management. But Gascoigne was never cut out for that. Nor was he equipped for an easy number on the Match of the Day sofa. Football simply had no place for him. And for all of us, that's a shame. Because when the cheers dry up, the tears are a truly painful sight.","Sportsmail revealed how Mackay had sent offensive text message .

He speaks to each player and gives them a clear vision of what he wants from them and there is no doubt he has an aura about him,' Forster told ESPNFC.COM. 'The boss had a fantastic career as a player and when he speaks, people want to listen and learn from his experience. 'Whether it was because so many people were writing us off and we wanted to prove them wrong I don't know, but the manager has helped the process. 'Eating breakfast and lunch together brings people together and there is a real good feeling at this club. I sensed that from the moment I walked through the door.'

He is a humble guy and has nothing to prove to anyone. He also has the respect of everyone and is not scared to take you aside and have a chat if you are doing something wrong.' And the left-back, who won the Champions League with his parent club in 2012, believes his Saints form could see him brought back into the England fold. 'I would like to think I have chances of getting England call-ups if I'm playing regular Premier League football in a successful team and that is what we have at Southampton,' he said. 'It is difficult to catch the eye of an England manager if you are not playing at a big club like Chelsea.'","Ryan Bertrand and Fraser Forster were both signed during the summer .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez has followed the lead of his Merseyside rival Brendan Rodgers and told England manager Roy Hodgson to handle his star youngster Ross Barkley with care. Despite saying 20-year-old Barkley was ‘born to play football’ after his triumphant comeback against Aston Villa at Goodison Park on Saturday, Martinez is already laying down a marker ahead of next month when England face Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier and a hostile friendly in Scotland. Just as Rodgers has regularly warned against Raheem Sterling ‘burn-out’ and didn’t want him to play 180 minutes against San Marino and Estonia, Martinez is also advising caution with Barkley, who returned on Saturday for the first time since damaging knee ligaments in pre-season. Ross Barkley returned to the Everton starting line-up against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon . Everton manager Roberto Martinez (left) wants England boss Roy Hodgson (right) to take care over Barkley . The Spaniard knows that England coach Ray Lewington, who was at Goodison to watch, will have reported back to Hodgson with enthusiasm after Barkley played a part in Everton’s first two goals. ‘We need to be careful with Ross and Sterling,’ said Martinez. ‘Yes, England will want him in the next squad, but Ross still can’t play 90 minutes and we will have to see how long it takes for him to do that. ‘He’s been out for 14 weeks so we need to be careful. We have six games in three weeks (at Everton) so we need to give what the players needs. ‘With young players and England there needs to be a process to learn what is expected. Look at Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka, they took it to a different level when they got the knowledge. ‘It is understandable that the young players go through those experiences before they can win games for England.’ The problem for Martinez is he can’t avoid talking up the midfielder himself, hailing him as a rare talent who can combine technical and physical excellence. Barkley left the game to a standing ovation from the Everton fans at Goodison Park . Raheem Sterling (right) returned to the Liverpool starting line-up on Sunday in their 3-2 win at QPR . It was Barkley’s stinging shot which forced the corner from which Jagielka scored Everton’s opener against Aston Villa after 18 minutes. Barkley then fed Romelu Lukaku for the second goal after 48 minutes, though Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan will feel he should have done better. Seamus Coleman wrapped up the points after 76 minutes after Barkley had already left the field to a standing ovation from the Goodison Park crowd. ‘It’s hard to explain how Ross could come back with a performance like that. It should have been impossible for him to start against Villa, but he trains so hard, he’s just a natural,’ said Martinez. ‘He just loves playing football, and you see that and in a way he had to play.’ Manchester City, who are short of top-class homegrown players, would be prepared to pay big money to take him to The Etihad so perhaps it wasn’t particularly wise for Martinez to add: ‘The bigger the game, the more you get from him.’ But the comparison with another Merseyside street footballer, Wayne Rooney, was apt. ‘There are similarities 100 per cent. Sometimes we have to drag Ross away from training because at the end he’s in the two v two with the young kids, and he loves it. Phil Jagielka is congratulated by Barkley and Leighton Baines (left) after scoring the opener against Villa . Belgium international Romelu Lukaku was also among the scorers in Everton's 3-0 win against Aston Villa . ‘We take him away because he doesn’t see the energy it takes out of his body. He approaches the game in that manner and that’s his biggest strength.’ Everton started the weekend just outside the bottom three without a win in five games. But their performance on Saturday suggests they will start climbing rapidly from now onwards although their next challenge is a Europa League trip to Lille on Thursday. Martinez will also have been pleased to see £28million record signing Lukaku notch his third goal of the season after an awkward start to the season for the giant Belgian. Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert is in the unusual position of hankering after Philippe Senderos after their capitulation at Goodison. Senderos, much-maligned during his career at Arsenal and Fulham, picked up a thigh injury on international duty with Switzerland and Villa flopped without him. ‘We missed Senderos because he has been excellent,’ admitted Lambert. ‘Hopefully he will be back for our next game against QPR. Skipper Ron Vlaar did return after a calf problem though the Villa boss thinks it will take a couple of weeks before he finds his top form again.","Ross Barkley returned from injury in Everton's win over Aston Villa .

"Arsene Wenger believes the strong British core of his current Arsenal squad will ensure the team does not break-up. Having ended their trophy drought against today’s opponents Hull City in last year’s FA Cup final, there is a belief the Gunners can go on to emulate some of Wenger’s previously successful sides. Over the years Arsenal have begrudgingly allowed their top stars move to rival clubs; the likes of Cesc Fabregas, Bacary Sagna, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Robin van Persie have all left the Emirates Stadium in recent seasons despite the Wenger’s attempts to keep them. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger: We've been hit hard with injuries . Gunners full backs Calum Chambers and Kieran Gibbs train together on England duty . Danny Welbeck (back, second left), Chambers (back, right), Jack Wilshere (front, right) and Gibbs (front, second right) all started for England against San Marino last week . Speaking at the club’s Annual General Meeting on Thursday, Wenger spoke of his determination to ensure the club’s playing staff develop an emotional affiliation with Arsenal. Having been criticised over the years for a seeming reluctance to use British talent, Wenger has come full circle and now has seven key first-team members who are homegrown, including Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Aaron Ramsey and Danny Welbeck. And Wenger is confident having a strong homegrown contingent will make it easier to ensure his current group doesn’t disband like previous squads. Arsene Wenger says English players find it easier to stay loyal to the club if rivals try to sign them . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) and Welbeck are two key members of Wenger's young English contingent . Theo Walcott made his return to football after nine months out for Arsenal's U21s on Friday night . ‘Are English players more loyal? It’s easier for them,’ said the Frenchman. ‘When you buy a player from Barcelona at some stage he might want to go back to Barcelona because Barcelona is a big club as well. ‘A guy who is English, who is from London and plays for Arsenal, why should he go? ‘But we had loyalty from people like [Thierry] Henry and [Patrick] Vieira, too. ‘They had a lot of success here. They were respected here and respected the values here. They live in London - that is also a special attraction.’ Arsenal have failed to hold on to the likes of Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri in recent years . Five Arsenal players - Wilshere, Welbeck, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Kieran Gibbs and Calum Chambers - played for England in the European Championship qualifier against Estonia on Sunday. And Wenger added: ‘I am very proud of that because for years I have been accused of not developing English players. ‘It shows you, when they are good, they play. In a good class you become better. That shows the good players will learn.’","Arsenal provided five players for England against Estonia this week .

"Click here to read Neil Ashton's interview with QPR midfielder Adel Taarabt . Adel Taarabt's explosive interview with Neil Ashton yielded plenty of memorable lines. Everything from AC Milan, the midfielder's shirt number and training under manager Harry Redknapp was discussed just hours after the 67-year-old claimed Taarabt was 'three stone overweight'. Here's 10 of the best quotes... In a revealing interview, Adel Taarabt said 67-year-old Harry Redknapp spends most of his time in his office . QPR midfielder Taarabt hits back at manager Redknapp's claim that he is 'three stone overweight' On Harry Redknapp: ‘He spends most of the time in his office but when he gets off the phone he comes down to watch for five or 10 minutes — he never takes a session' ... ‘That’s when he said he had it in mind to start me against Liverpool.’ Adel Taarabt's work ethic was challenged by Redknapp, who alluded to the Moroccan having a bad attitude . On 'that' reserve game against Wolves: ‘I played in that reserve game for 90 minutes and if he didn’t think I was running he could have taken me off. Maybe I didn’t perform like I could because it was a reserve team game and I was protecting myself.' On fitness: 'Maybe he expects me to make more tackles. I am not this type of player. I can only get fitness playing Premier League. You can train six or seven hours, but you won’t be fit.’ Redknapp shakes hands with Taarabt in training in July of last year, after the club had been relegated . On training under Redknapp: ‘The training sessions aren’t the same standard as Milan, or what I would expect under another manager. They are not as intense, the players aren’t as motivated. It is the same as we used to do at Tottenham years ago. On QPR: 'The problem is we don’t have any plan in the game, we don’t know how to press as a team. It’s not about just running around, you need to play with your brain.' On Glenn Hoddle: ‘[He] loves me, but I don’t know if Harry listens to him.' The 25-year-old claims QPR first-team coach Glenn Hoddle (left) likes him but Redknapp may ignore his advice . On Les Ferdinand: ‘I spoke with Les Ferdinand and he told me “what a player you are — you should be in the team every time. I followed you at Milan and you were fantastic”. ‘Les doesn’t speak to us in training, but he watches us and then goes to watch the kids as well. He knows me from my days at Tottenham so we have a good relationship.’ Taarabt also says new head of football operations Les Ferdinand regularly praises him . On AC Milan: ‘When I was playing at Milan, sometimes Kaka or Robinho weren’t getting in the team. Then I come to QPR, and that’s not to disrespect my team-mates because I have a good relationship with them, but I was surprised I was not in the squad.' Taarabt claimed that he kept Brazilian stars Robinho (left) and Kaka out of the AC Milan team last year . On his shirt number: ‘When I came back from Milan, the QPR kitman said “you are no more No 10”. I never wanted to be No 10 but the fans asked the chairman for Adel to be 10 not 7 because of the legend Stan Bowles — they wanted me to have the 10 shirt. ‘They said they had never seen an exciting player like this for 20 or 25 years, so I said to Tony Fernandes I will take it. Then this summer I was told I would be 27 so I said “OK, no problem”. I said nothing.’ On his weight: ‘My heaviest weight at Milan was 86kg (13st 8lb), my lightest 84kg — now I’m 85kg. It’s not true to say I’m not fit. He tried to give an excuse.'","Adel Taarabt has responded to Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp's claims that he was 'three stone overweight'

"Luol Deng admits he does not know what the future holds for British basketball and thinks funding cuts have left the sport at the point of no return. The 29-year-old, who signed for the Miami Heat in July, has twice been named an NBA All-Star and turned out for Great Britain the 2012 Olympics. It was following the Games that UK Sport announced basketball would no longer receive funding - with the belief that the team would struggle to win medals in the 2016 Olympics. Concerned look: Luol Deng thinks basketball in the UK is close to folding due to funding cuts by UK Sport . In response to the news, with British Basketball deciding against an appeal, Deng has set up his own academy in partnership with Nike, Evelyn Grace Academy and Reforming Black Britain with the aim to produce elite basketball players. But, as defeat to Iceland last week meant Britain can no longer qualify for EuroBasket 2015, Deng admits the future appears bleak. 'We are very close,' he said at when asked if the sport was close to folding in the UK. 'At this point I don't know what is next, we just have to wait and see what the plan is. I really don't know the reason for it. Eyes on the prize: Deng was speaking at the launch of his own basketball academy . 'People are judging us by the Olympics but people are not judging it by what it took to get to the Olympics. 'Everyone just wanted to show up and watch but they didn't watch the growth of the game from the level we were in on day one to the point where we reached the Olympics. 'You then have six games where you are judged and all of a sudden everything you have done in five or six years is judged within those games. 'It is just bad timing. Funding has a lot to do with it - I think guys are now questioning if the team is not committed to us then why are we so committed. Joint venture: Deng has created the academy in partnership with Nike, in order to produce elite UK players . 'We have come a long way since day one and I think that has been taken away from us. 'No one has appreciated where we have to come to reach the level and compete with all of these teams. To go back to nothing is very disappointing and we have got to keep believing in ourselves.' Deng reckons basketball is a sport which can give youngsters from underprivileged backgrounds the chance to flourish and the progression made over a short period of time should count for something. He said: 'People should look back at how far we have come along and what we have done to be here. 'This is an opportunity to really get a lot of young kids off the street and have them focus on a sport - a sport that gives an opportunity to many, not just to a few. Bigger picture: Deng says basketball is a sport that gives underprivileged youngsters an opportunity to flourish . 'They could use this as a tool to become something and basketball also takes up a lot of your time so instead of wasting time they would be using their time valuably. 'I went to the US and had an opportunity to play basketball in school and it gave me a chance to divide my time right. 'The kids here (at the Deng Academy) can focus on their school but also have the opportunity to be coached by a great coach and put in the hours into basketball.' Next up for Deng is to start his career with the Heat and, although he is aware that he will be expected to replace the outgoing LeBron James, he wants to be his own man. Pastures new: Deng is looking forward to replacing LeBron James at the Miami Heat next season . 'That is what it is,' he added. 'People are going to talk about LeBron and what he has done in the past. For myself, I have got to be able to understand that I have to be the best I can be. 'My whole thing is taking my own picture and putting out there what I can do and it is up to everyone else to mix and match. 'For me, it is all about the team I'm playing for and the guys I'm playing with the goals we are trying to accomplish.'","Luol Deng thinks basketball in the UK is close folding due to sporting cuts .

"QPR manager Harry Redknapp is not to blame for the team's position at the bottom of the Premier League, according to Rangers midfielder Adel Taarabt. Redknapp's side were beaten 2-0 by West Ham on Sunday meaning the team have taken just four points from their opening seven league games. QPR's defeat was compounded by a sluggish display that has placed added scrutiny on Redknapp and his ability to motivate his under-performing players. Adel Taarabt said Harry Redknapp is not to blame for QPR's poor form after their defeat to West Ham . 'It is easy to blame the manager when you lose but the players have to step up,' said Taarabt, who came on for 24 minutes at Upton Park but is yet to start a match this season. 'The manager can change tactics, tell us what he wants, but when we go on the pitch it is the players who perform. 'It is disappointing, we are bottom of the league. 'If we keep clean sheets we can win games, but at the moment we are not doing that so it is hard for us.' QPR were relegated under Redknapp during his first season in charge and could be again this season . Redknapp said his players' fitness was not up to scratch after the West Ham defeat, with a number of his squad still regaining sharpness after injury. Taarabt has been struggling with an ankle problem since the summer and the talented Moroccan is still trying to re-establish himself at Loftus Road after a permanent move to AC Milan break down in the summer. 'I was in the middle of a transfer and it did not happen for whatever reason,' Taarabt said. 'It was difficult for me because I thought I was moving. In the end it did not happen, so I am now and have to work hard to get back in the team and help QPR win games. The talented Moroccan midfielder, who was on loan at AC Milan last year, said the players were to blame . 'These two weeks for the international break will help me get to 100 per cent. I did not have a very good pre-season and I need games. Hopefully my ankle will be fine, it is not a big injury.' Taarabt scored four goals in 14 league appearances while on loan at Milan last season and the 25-year-old admits he had hoped to sign permanently for the Italian giants in the summer. 'I had a taste of something different last year, playing in the Champions League at a big club [while on loan at AC Milan],' Taarabt said. 'That is why I wanted to move. Not because I do want to be at QPR, because it was a big opportunity for me. 'Do not forget that this club has helped me a lot. I am one of the longest-serving players here now, and I still love the club. It will always be in my heart. I am very concentrated on QPR and giving my best.'

"Harry Redknapp has told Adel Taarabt to concentrate on getting fit for QPR rather than agitating for a January transfer. Taarabt's agent has claimed the midfielder has been told he can leave the club in the next transfer window, but Redknapp believes there is no interest in the Morocco star. Taarabt continues to battle ankle trouble, with Redknapp claiming the 25-year-old struggles to stay in shape. Harry Redknapp wants Adel Taarabt to return to fitness instead of agitating for a move away from QPR . Taarabt spent a loan spell with AC Milan but Redknapp says the Italians are not interested in permanent move . Redknapp said QPR will only entertain Taarabt leaving on a permanent transfer, with the west London club holding out for a £4.5million fee. Taarabt spent time on loan at AC Milan last season, but former Spurs boss Redknapp believes the San Siro club have cooled interest in a long-term deal. 'Well I know nothing about that; the first thing he needs to go is to get fit and start playing football here, isn't it?' said Redknapp. 'That's all we want Adel to do is, to be fit to play for QPR. 'I don't where he's got the green light to leave in January from, he had the green light to leave in the summer, but there was no one, Milan didn't come in for him. 'He's always had the green light if somebody wants to pay the money the club wants for him. Redknapp wants the out of shape Morocco star to earn back his starting place in the team . 'If they don't pay the money he stays here. 'But I need him fit, I want to get him fit, he's a good player, a real talent, I just want to get him out on the training ground every day, get him fit and playing for QPR, that's my only interest at the moment. 'Milan don't seem to be interested in him now, no.' Rangers take on West Ham at Upton Park in Premier League action on Sunday, bidding to hit back from 2-1 defeat at Southampton. Brazilian midfielder Sandro was withdrawn from action at St Mary's last weekend after suffering a knock to the head. Brazilian midfielder Sandro has been sidelined  after being forced off with a head injury . The former Spurs star will be fit to face West Ham, but Redknapp admitted Joey Barton and Jordon Mutch are still battling hamstring trouble. 'We're not sure who will be fit really, we've got to have a look at one or two of them,' he said. 'We won't be sure until we get through today, then we'll see how they are. 'The knock on the head to Sandro was just a thing that happened, he's recovered fully so hopefully he'll be okay. 'We need to tighten up, but it's been difficult because I've brought some midfielders into the club and they've never been fit to play. Joey Barton is one of several Rangers players rated doubtful for Sunday's match against West Ham . 'We've never got them on the pitch at one time, there's always been a problem. 'Sandro's come in and been injured, Jordon Mutch has been injured, Joey Barton has been injured so it's been difficult really to get a real settled group in there. 'You need midfielders to weight in with goals, they have to score and if they're not doing that they're not producing.'","Harry Redknapp tells Adel Taarabt to get in shape not think about a move .

"Harry Redknapp launched a scathing attack on the absent Adel Taarabt — calling the Morocco forward fat and lazy. Taarabt has featured just three times for QPR this season and was loaned out last season to both Fulham and AC Milan. The 25-year-old has been criticised for his lack of fitness by Redknapp this season, but the QPR boss did not hold back after the defeat by Liverpool. Adel Taarabt (left, with Armand Traore, Eduardo Vargas and Mauricio Isla) posted this  before the Reds game . Taarabt's work ethic was challenged by Redknapp, who alluded to the Moroccan having a bad attitude .

The 25-year-old was on loan at AC Milan last season (left) and has been playing for QPR reserves (right) Redknapp blasted Taarabt, who posted pictures on Instagram before and after the Liverpool game, as he explained his omission, saying: 'He's not injured. He's not fit. He's not fit to play football unfortunately. He played in a reserve game the other day and I could have run about more than he did. 'I pick people who want to try, who come in every day and work, train and show a good attitude. When he starts doing that, if he ever can, maybe he'll get a game. I can't protect people who don't want to run and train, and are about three stone overweight.' 'What am I supposed to say? Keep getting your 60, 70 grand a week and don't train?' Redknapp twice watched his side throw away a point in a frantic period of injury time at Loftus Road. He was livid with his side's defensive discipline in the final minute of injury time, as Liverpool scored the winner on a quick counter attack after Leroy Fer had wasted a QPR free-kick.

'There's no point getting loads of men forward if you're going to shoot, as you'll get caught at the back. 'You have to get organised, and not get done on the counter-attack.' Despite the loss, Redknapp, who lost Sandro (groin) and Nedum Onuoha (hamstring) to injuries, was optimistic about his side's display. The QPR manager's position has been the subject of speculation in recent weeks, but he said: 'There isn't anyone who could do any better here than me.'

'But United is not the be all and end all. I'm sure we're both happy to be on the pitch and playing 90 minutes every week. 'Last year at times it wasn't enjoyable and you play your best football when you're enjoying yourself. I certainly am enjoying myself now, so hopefully that can show for Villa on the pitch.'

"Manuel Pellegrini believes football will be the loser when his Manchester City team face CSKA Moscow behind closed doors here on Tuesday night. The Champions League group game at the Arena Khimki will be played in a surreal atmosphere after UEFA punished the home team for the behaviour of their fans in recent games. But City boss Pellegrini believes nobody wins from the decision. Matija Nastasic (left), Stevan Jovetic, Aleksandar Kolarov and Edin Dzeko train in Moscow . Manchester City stars were preparing for their Champions League clash at CSKA Moscow on Tuesday . City stars were feeling the chill as many trained in snoods and winter garments ahead of the game . He said: 'I had this experience many years ago. I can’t remember when. 'It will be very strange with everybody being able to hear the players’ voices during the game. 'But we have no option and we must play that way. 'Many may think the local team will suffer the most damage, but I think the biggest loser is the game of football. 'It’s a pity that we can’t play with fans. This show is for fans and it will be a strange game.' While Pellegrini has experienced the surreal atmosphere of an empty stadium before, it will be a new experience for Pablo Zabaleta. Fresh from scoring four against Tottenham, Sergio Aguero (centre) also trained with City team-mates . Dzeko was among the few City stars who trained in shorts and with little winter wear . Summer signing Eliaquim Mangala (third right) was nearly covered in head-to-toe during the session, however . City stars looked focused in training as they chase their first Champions League win of the season . He said: 'It will be strange. I have never had the experience before. Sometimes it happens. We just have to take care of ourselves. I hope we can play a great game and get an important three points.' City have yet to win in Group E, losing to Bayern Munich in Germany on matchday one and then drawing at home to Roma. But the full back sees now reason to change their attacking approach against in-form CSKA, who sit second in the Russian league and beat Kuban Krasnodar 6-0 at the weekend. Zabaleta added: 'We have great defenders. Normally we like to attack and sometimes we can concede space at the back. Manuel Pellegrini's City team will be hoping for their first win of the Champions League campaign . The City squad prepare for their flight to the Russian capital to take on CSKA . The match will be played at an empty Khimki Arena after CSKA fans were banned for racist chanting . 'It would be easy to put 10 players in our own half but we aren't that kind of team. We press high and leave space between the lines, that's the way we like to play and we won't change.' Pellegrini launched a stern defence of Yaya Toure, who has come in for criticism for his inconsistent performances this season. The Chilean said: 'If you compare his performances to last year's brilliant form maybe he just needs time. City have yet to pick up their first win in Group E, having lost to Bayern Munich and drawn with Roma . Dzeko posted this picture of the snow in Moscow - temperatures are expected to be below zero . Sergio Aguero scored all four goals in City's 4-1 win over Tottenham at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday . 'He will continue to be a very important player for our team, if you look at his goal against Villa you can see his quality. He had a busy summer but he's getting better and is getting near to his normal form.' Pellegrini also suggested that Toure could be deployed as a No 10 in the future. He said: 'It can be an option because he has the quality to play behind the striker. In the national team [Ivory Coast] he plays forward. 'In our team he's a very important midfielder and he will continue to play in that role. When he has had problems it's because the team has had problems. Pablo Zabaleta said City will not change their approach and will take the match to CSKA on Tuesday . Pellegrini defended his midfielder Yaya Toure after some inconsistent performances this season . 'When he plays well in his midfield position he is the best at that role in the Premier League.' Their slow start to the group stage underlined just how far City have to go to succeed on the European stage, but Zabaleta believes sheer hard graft is the key. 'It takes time,' the Argentine said. 'We are a team that's improved in the last few years but this competition demands so much, playing the best teams in Europe. 'We are improving and have great players but this is so difficult. We would like to win this but we have to work really hard to do it. 'We just need to work hard and win games and learn from mistakes in previous years.' City's players huddle for warmth under blankets during City's 2-1 win against CSKA last season . Sergio Aguero scored twice at the Arena Khimki to give City a crucial victory . The two teams met at this point in the Champions League last season, with two Sergio Aguero goals earning City a vital 2-1 victory. But a bone of contention was the state of the pitch at the Arena Khimki, which had been unable to cope with heavy rainfall and was badly cut up. Pellegrini said it was 'unbelievable' that the match had been able to go ahead on such a poor surface. Although the match is expected to be played in sub-zero temperatures, with the first snowfall of the Russian winter seen over the weekend, Pellegrini has no complaints about the surface. He said: 'Last year we were concerned. It was impossible and we knew that before the game. This year, no. It's not the best as its difficult here in winter but its normal and we have no problems.'","Manchester City are in Moscow to play CSKA in Champions League .

We are going to use that advantage against them. 'In a couple of games they haven't been that good. They are very weak in the defence, so we are going to do our best to work against that.

CSKA have been punished by European governing body UEFA over crowd racism incidents three times in the last year. The first of those offences came when City visited in the same competition a year ago and fans directed monkey chants at Yaya Toure. Musa, speaking at CSKA's pre-match press conference, said: 'We are going to miss the fans. It is very difficult for us to play without our fans.'

I am not able to answer this question because I am a sports professional.' CSKA go into the game in good heart after beating Kuban Krasnodar 6-0 at the weekend.

"It says much for the way things have changed at Manchester City that manager Manuel Pellegrini had to cut short his post-match media duties on Saturday to meet the former King of Spain. There was a time when the most famous match-day visitor at City home games was comic Eddie Large. Pellegrini, however, now moves from a royal audience to the prospect of no audience at all as his team prepare for Tuesday night's behind-closed-doors Champions League tie with CSKA Moscow in Russia. Sergio Aguero struck FOUR goals for City against Tottenham on Saturday as the hosts cruised to a 4-1 victory . Aguero takes the match ball after the game and his performance would have delighted boss Manuel Pellegrini . This was only the second game in Premier League history to have four penalties. The other was Bradford City’s 4-4 draw with Derby in 2000. It will be a peculiar experience for the City manager and his players. CSKA are serving a UEFA punishment imposed because of persistent racist chanting. Their Arena Khimki Stadium will be empty when the teams meet in a game Pellegrini says his team have to win if they are to qualify for the knock-out stages. ‘We must win if we want to continue to have options to qualify for the next stage,’ said Pellegrini. ‘I always said when you want to win something you need a team that knows how to play. ‘After that you need to have your best performance when you need them. We have very important players and they must make the difference now.’ Aguero could have scored a first half hat-trick but missed his second penalty and the rebound . So far, City have lost to Bayern Munich and drawn with Roma, and Pellegrini said: ‘Against Bayern we were a little unlucky. Against Roma here we didn’t play well, but I hope we start now in the Champions League playing the way we have in the last two games in the Premier League.’ Ideally, City need two victories from back-to-back games against the Russians. CSKA Moscow warmed up for their clash with City with a 6-0 thrashing of Kuban Krasnodar. Forwards Ahmed Mousa and Seydou Doumbia scored two goals each as the Russians ran riot. The win made sure they stayed in touch with Andre Villas-Boas’ Zenit St Petersburg, who lead the Russian Premier League by two points. Certainly there are question marks against the English champions in Europe. Saturday’s victory over Tottenham came on the back of four goals from the splendid Sergio Aguero and a superb display from goalkeeper Joe Hart. Peculiarly, though, there remains an air of vulnerability about City when they do not have the ball. Both Roma and Bayern could have scored more goals against them, as indeed could Spurs, and it was interesting to hear visiting manager Mauricio Pochettino admit that his players had been told to exploit spaces in front of City’s back four. ‘Yes, we were aware of that and we tried to use it,’ said Pochettino. Meanwhile, Hart acknowledged the issue while reminding his team-mates it is up to them to cope with the peculiar circumstances surrounding Tuesday’s game. Hart said: ‘Like the manager said, we are always going to score goals. We just have to keep down the number we let in at the other end. ‘It’s just about getting the “W”. It sounds crazy, but if you have a stinker and we win, that is the main thing. Aguero strokes home his fourth goal of the game and is now level with Diego Costa as the top scorer . VIDEO Aguero on eof the best strikers in the world - Pellegrini . ‘Tuesday will take me back to my Shrewsbury reserves days, going to play Blackpool away at Bloomfield Road when there were Coke cans clattering around the pitch. ‘It’s a bit different — there is a bit more on this one — but it’s a game of football at the end of the day, whether there are 100,000 there or just the benches, it’s no different. ‘You can’t let it affect you as a player, we have a job to do out there. I have massive sympathy for our fans because it wasn’t us that caused this, but they are the rules and unfortunately we have to abide by them. I don’t think too many of them will be bothered as long as we win.’ City remain a devastating side when they have the ball. Aguero’s finishing was sublime on Saturday and he could even afford to miss a penalty — one of four awarded in the game — and score the goals he needed to take him past Carlos Tevez (58) as City’s leading scorer in the Premier League. He now has 61 in total. ‘I owe a special thanks to my team-mates and City’s fans,’ said Aguero.‘It’s a pride to become City’s maximum goalscorer in Premier League history.’ Midfielder Yaya Toure should start against CSKA Moscow after beginning as a substitute on Saturday . It is hard to imagine Aguero not starting Tuesday night’s game in what are expected to be below-freezing temperatures. Equally, midfielder Yaya Toure should start after beginning as a substitute on Saturday. Sergio Aguero's four-goal haul against Tottenham makes him Manchester City's all-time top Premier League scorer. Sergio Aguero - 61 goals (95 games) Carlos Tevez - 58 goals (113 games) Edin Dzeko - 48 goals (115 games) Yaya Toure - 42 goals (141 games) Nicolas Anelka - 37 goals (89 games) Toure has struggled as part of a holding midfield in Europe this season and it may well be that he plays in Moscow as a second striker. City gave the ball away carelessly at times against Tottenham and will need to be a little more resolute in Russia. Pellegrini added: ‘I think we had excess of trust with the ball at our foot because we lost three or four important balls near our box, that can finish with a goal. ‘And in that way I am sure we will have the concentration we need first to not concede a goal. ‘I hope we are going to play in the same way as we did against Aston Villa recently, not conceding one chance... well, I think one chance in 90 minutes. ‘We must be balanced. Football is always different and changing. If you are talking about the game we played today, yes, of course, it’s not normal to me to concede or lose so many balls near our box, but if you talk to me about the (other) games we play we didn’t lose balls but we didn’t have clear chances to score. ‘So we must be a balanced team, a very concentrated team and continue playing the same way we are doing so far, maybe the year-and-a-half that I have been here.’ 'Referee Jonathan Moss awarded four penalties at the Etihad but not all were correct decisions... 'Penalty 1: Award was not wrong technically because there was contact but the worst decision of them all. Frank Lampard (left) threw himself to the ground from Erik Lamela’s slight touch. 'Penalty 2: Clearest of the four as Younes Kaboul wiped out David Silva. 'Penalty 3: This was the most interesting, and watching Martin Demichelis you can see he trips Roberto Soldado when tracking from behind. It was a foul but contact was just outside the area. 'Penalty 4: Moss right to award it as Federico Fazio clearly fouls Sergio Aguero but the red card was wrong as it was not clear and obvious that Aguero would have met the cross or scored.'","Sergio Aguero went past Carlos Tevez as Manchester City's leading Premier League scorer with 61 goals with his four strikes against Tottenham .

"As revealed by Sportsmail's Charles Sale, the Premier League are exploring the possibility of a live Sunday night fixture in an attempt to keep Sky Sports and BT Sport happy. With competition between the two broadcasters stiffer than ever, the Premier League are looking into creating another live television slot when the next three-year agreement comes into effect in the 2016-17 season. But would a live Sunday night Premier League fixture work? We explore the pros and cons. The Premier League are exploring the possibility of introducing a Sunday night fixture . Advantages . 1. Another live game means another one we can watch. The Premier League would ditch another Saturday 3pm kick-off, meaning we could watch the entire match live rather than wait all night until Match of the Day or Football First. 2. Sunday night fixtures are a regular in most of Europe's top leagues. This Sunday night, for example, Elche take on Sevilla in Spain's La Liga, Inter Milan face Napoli in Italy's Serie A and Montpellier host Lyon in France's Ligue 1. Instead of being left with a choice of continental action at 6pm on a Sunday night once Sky's Super Sunday finishes, why not have another Premier League game to watch? BT Sport and Sky Sports paid the Premier League £3billion for the live rights from 2013-2016 . 3. The terrestrial television line-up on Sunday night is pretty weak. A live Premier League game on a Sunday night would mean not having to sit through the Antiques Roadshow, X Factor results show or Downton Abbey. 4. Selling another live game would mean even more money generated. The Premier League raked in more than £5billion from broadcasters around the world from 2013 to 2016 with £3bn of that coming from the UK. But the Premier League only sold 154 games from a total of 380 toSky Sports and BT Sport, with each game costing just shy of £20million. At that rate, an extra 38 live games (one every week) would generate another £760m. 5. The Premier League are looking at an extra game on a Sunday night - that means in addition to theSuper Sunday double bill we currently enjoy on Sky. Could you imagine how good a triple header of live Premier League action would be? Just three of Liverpool's 13 Premier League games from August to November are not televised . Disadvantages . 1. It would create even more travel problems for supporters, who are already given little consideration. It's quite an effort to make your way home from the other side of the country after a midweek game, but the Sunday public transport service creates some logistical nightmares for fans. 2. Sunday is generally a day to be spent with the family. That time has already been shortened to the evening due to Super Sunday dominating the afternoon agenda. Surely fathers, husbands and boyfriends can't blag another 90 minutes in front of the television. Chelsea's clash with Arsenal featured as part of Sky's Super Sunday double header last weekend . 3. The international audience cannot be underestimated, especially in Asia. A match starting in the evening in England would take place in the early hours of the morning in places such as China and India. Spain's La Liga are making an effort to bring their kick-off times forward from the evening to the afternoon to compete with the Premier League in markets such as the Far East. In terms of the Asian audience, a Saturday 3pm kick-off makes much more sense than a Sunday evening fixture. 4. Managers of teams in the Champions League are forever asking for more help from the Premier League when it comes to fixture scheduling. Playing even later on a Sunday wouldn't please the likes of Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger, especially if they have a big European tie coming up that week. 5. Another live game on a Sunday would mean yet another one lost from the traditional Saturday 3pm slot, which used to be the centrepiece of the football weekend. Most European leagues, including Spain's La Liga, schedule fixtures on a Sunday night .","Sunday night fixture could be sold in addition to current rights packages .

"Danny Welbeck rescued Arsenal with a late equaliser on Saturday, but the Gunners lost more crucial points in the title race. Check out ADAM SHERGOLD'S player ratings from the Emirates Stadium. ARSENAL . Wojciech Szczesny 6 . Had very little to do all afternoon as Hull had took their chances clinically. Perhaps committed to ground a little too early for the first, allowing Diame to lift the ball over him. Hector Bellerin 6.5 . Making his first Premier League start, the Spaniard did little wrong but didn’t get forward as much as he is known to do. Made a fine slide tackle to prevent Andrew Robertson storming through in first-half stoppage time. Per Mertesacker (c) 6 . Little threat to deal with for long spells of the game but was outjumped by Abel Hernandez for Hull’s second goal and should have been more alert to the threat. Per Mertesacker and Mathieu Flamini protest to referee Roger East after Mohamed Diame's goal . Nacho Monreal 6.5 . Didn’t do much wrong considering he was played out of position because of Arsenal’s debilitating defensive injury crisis. Isn’t as tall as most centre-backs but was effective in the air when Hull threatened aerially. Kieran Gibbs 6.5 . Didn’t need a second invitation to bomb forward down the left and was there in support of a number of Arsenal assaults in the first-half. Mathieu Flamini 6 . Fetched and carried between defence and midfield without doing anything spectacular. Was too lightweight as Mohamed Diame bustled up behind him to score Hull’s equaliser though Flamini did have a strong case for a foul as he was being wrestled back. Jack Wilshere 7 . Had been bright and effective throughout, collecting the ball in deep central positions and beating Hull defenders with ease. Like all Arsenal’s creative players, was perhaps guilty of playing one pass too many. Took a nasty knock to the ankle with 20 minutes left and walked straight down the tunnel - another injury worry for Arsene Wenger. Jack Wilshere receives a yellow card from East as he leaves the field with an ankle injury . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 5.5 . Not really his afternoon. Took him until the second half to have a meaningful run forward and struggled to make an impression. There were more misplaced passes than normal and he tended to over-complicate, leading to Arsenal’s moves breaking down (though he wasn’t alone). It wasn't Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's day as Arsenal struggled against Hull City at the Emirates Stadium . Santi Cazorla 6.5 . Carried a real threat in the first-half, buzzing around right around the box and came within inches of opening the scoring with a curling shot from outside the box that Harper had to tip away at full stretch. Alexis Sanchez 7 . Dangerous, particularly during the opening exchanges when Arsenal dominated. Should have scored with a follow-up when Harper saved from Welbeck early on but did find the target with a classy step-over to beat his marker and then a precise low shot across Harper and in at the far post. Danny Welbeck 6.5 . In the right areas but snuffed out by a rigid Hull defence until right near the end. Should have scored early on after breaking clear through the middle but Harper pushed away his shot. Took his late goal very well though, to the relief of the majority inside the ground. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (right) goes past Hull centre back Michael Dawson . Substitutes . Aaron Ramsey (for Flamini 62) 7 . A welcome sight for the home fans when he came on for Flamini with half-an-hour left. Helped instigate their late siege that eventually yielded a point. Joel Campbell (for Wilshere 68) 6.5 . Received a warm welcome and gave a good account of himself when he replaced the injured Wilshere. Sharp in passing and movement. Not used: Tomas Rosicky, Mikel Arteta, Emiliano Martinez (GK), Francis Coquelin, Semi Ajayi . HULL CITY . Steve Harper 7 . Produced a hat-trick of superb saves to prevent Hull being blown away by a gale-force Arsenal start. He blocked Danny Welbeck's shot, then readjusted to block an Alexis follow-up. Also tipped over a curling effort from Santi Cazorla. Suffered an arm injury and went off at end of first-half. Hull keeper Steve Harper clutches his arm after picking up an injury at the Emirates . James Chester 6 . Shown up early on by Gibbs, who got beyond him and nearly set up a chance for Oxlade-Chamberlain. Booked for a rash tackle on Cazorla, which the Spaniard hurdled in the nick of time. Curtis Davies (c) 6.5 . Sanchez left him for dead for Arsenal’s goal but after that was a composed figure as Hull absorbed wave after wave of attack. Michael Dawson 8 . Terrific performance to keep Arsenal at bay. Made clearance after clearance and marshalled the back line as Arsenal tried to pass through it. Fine slide tackle to deny Welbeck a clear goalscoring opportunity and a chance in the first half that Szczesny caught. Limped off towards the end. Michael Dawson was outstanding for Hull as Steve Bruce's men held on for a draw . Ahmed Elmohamady 6.5 . Had few opportunities to get forward himself but was able to stem Arsenal’s flow by reading the play and guessing passes and crossed. Decent display. Tom Huddlestone 7 . Tireless performance as he was pinned further and further back during the second half. Shielded the defence and they nearly held out. Some nice passing as well heading in the opposite direction, especially early on wide to Elmohamady. Jake Livermore 6.5 . Again, unable to influence things too much in attack but helped cut off some of the supply lines as Arsenal laid siege. Mohamed Diame 7.5 . Bustling and powerful, not least when he powered past three defenders (with a hint of a foul) before producing an excellent dink over Szczesny for his fourth Hull goal. Mohamed Diame (right) shuts down Wilshere during a bustling and powerful performance for Hull . Andrew Robertson 6 . Not as effective as on previous afternoons and it took a good 30 minutes for him to get a chance to run at Arsenal. Creativity slowly turned into defensive duty as the game wore on. Hatem Ben Arfa 6 . Barely noticed going forward as Arsenal kept him well and truly contained. Late replacement for Nikica Jelavic, who pulled his hamstring in the warm-up. Saw little of the ball until he outjumped Per Mertesacker to power home a header early in the second-half. Abel Hernandez celebrates after powering home a header to give his side a 2-1 lead . Substitutes: . Eldin Jakupovic (for Harper 42) 7 . Made a number of good saves to keep Arsenal at bay, especially to tip over a Sanchez header . Gaston Ramirez (for Hernandez 62) 6 . A quiet half-hour cameo as the ball was largely down the other end. Alex Bruce (for Dawson 84) Not used: Liam Rosenior, Robbie Brady, Stephen Quinn .","Danny Welbeck rescued a point for Arsenal with late equaliser .

"Brendan Rodgers admitted that his ambition is to manage a club in Spain as the Liverpool boss revealed that he is already learning more Spanish. Rodgers said in a stunning interview with Spanish newspaper AS that he wants to stay in charge at Anfield for the next 20 years but has already started preparing for a move abroad one day. The 41-year-old Northern Irishman admitted that he tries to communicate with Liverpool's Spanish players - Jose Enrique, Alberto Moreno, Suso and Javi Manquillo - in their native language, rather than English. Brendan Rodgers has given a wide-ranging interview to Spanish newspaper AS, published on Monday and the translation of the quote on the front page says: 'I've not seen a team like this Madrid for a long time' Rodgers congratulates Raheem Sterling after Sunday's scrappy victory at QPR . Asked by AS where he sees himself in five years' time Rodgers said: 'I don’t know, I hope one day to work in Spain. 'I’ve studied Spanish, but I need to improve. I’ll probably improve when I work in the country one day. For most people, when they travel to a country their language becomes better. * Liverpool struggles after losing Suarez are just a 'short-term hit' on our 'magic carpet ride', insists Rodgers . * Rodgers: Ronaldo and Bale are so fast they could run in the Olympic 100m final! 'I speak to the Spanish players that we have in Spanish.' Rodgers is gaining a reputation as one of the game's brightest young bosses but faces the biggest test of his managerial career so far when his Liverpool side host Real Madrid at Anfield in the Champions League on Wednesday night. The Reds struggled to contain a QPR side featuring the likes of Bobby Zamora and Leroy Fer during Sunday's scrappy 3-2 victory at Loftus Road, but now he must find a way to stop the European champions with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, James Rodriguez and Karim Benzema in their ranks.

But Rodgers admits that he speaks to the likes of Jose Enrique (centre) in Spanish to boost his language skills . Rodgers, however, is relishing the challenge and views Liverpool's struggles to replicate last-season's stunning form as merely a blip in what he hopes will be a long stay at Anfield.

"Brendan Rodgers has admitted that Liverpool are struggling to overcome the loss of Luis Suarez to Barcelona in the summer but insisted that it is just a 'short-term hit' to the club's ambitions. The Reds manager has given a stunning interview to Spanish newspaper AS, in which he reveals that he hopes to manage in Spain and that he's already learning Spanish. Rodgers also said that the club had been on a 'magic carpet ride' since he took the reins at Anfield in June 2012 but that the loss of Suarez has stopped the development of his side. Brendan Rodgers has given a wide-ranging interview with Spanish newspaper AS, published on Monday - the translation of the quote on the front page says: 'I've not seen a team like this Madrid for a long time' * Rodgers: I want to manage in Spain one day... and I'm already learning Spanish from Liverpool players! * Ronaldo and Bale are so fast they could run in the Olympic 100m final! But while Rodgers conceded that Liverpool are stuttering, the 41-year-old Northern Irishman also insisted that the club's long-term plans for growth are on course and pleaded for patience as he rebuilds a side without Suarez. 'The last 18 months we have been on a magic carpet ride of development but we still have a lot of growth to make,' Rodgers told AS. 'The natural progression of the team, probably in the summer, has been challenged. 'We obviously lost a world-class player but our challenge now is to progress. It will be slow but steady and that will always be the best way to get to where we want to.' Mario Balotelli reacts during another insipid performance for Liverpool at QPR on Sunday . The struggling Italy striker skied a shot when he had an open goal gaping during the lucky 3-2 victory . Adam Lallana battles against QPR, but none of Rodgers' summer signings can yet be considered a success . Suarez inspired Liverpool to an unlikely challenge for the Barclays Premier League title last season before he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup and picked up a lengthy suspension which he carried over to Catalonia. The loss of Suarez has led to an overhaul of the squad, with the £75million banked from the striker's sale helping towards a £100m-plus splurge on the squad. Mario Balotelli, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Emre Can, Lazar Markovic, Dejan Lovren, Alvaro Moreno and Divock Origi (back at Lille on loan) have all been brought in, but none of the new signings can yet be considered anything like a success at Anfield. Liverpool have failed to match the standards set last season, due in part to injury suffered by Suarez's strike partner Daniel Sturridge, and are already nine points behind league leaders Chelsea. There are also serious concerns about the form of Suarez's replacement, Balotelli, who has scored just once for his new club and put in another dismal performance during Sunday's scrappy 3-2 win at QPR. Luis Suarez was the inspiration behind Liverpool's unexpected challenge for the Premier League title last term . The Uruguay striker has now left for Barcelona, and is set to soon make his debut following his ban for biting . Rodgers insisted that when he moved to Anfield he had been set a target of challenging for the title within three years and 'restoring Liverpool to what it had been' at home and in Europe, meaning he was ahead of schedule in just missing out to Manchester City by two points last season. The latest test for Rodgers comes in the form of European champions Real Madrid, who visit Anfield on Wednesday night in the Champions League. 'It’s an exciting time at Liverpool with lots of young players coming in,' said Rodgers. 'But if we are going to get better, we are going to take the short-term hit at the moment knowing that in the long-term the club will be better for it.' Rodgers also tipped Suarez to be a 'big success' at Barcelona, saying: 'He will succeed.' 'I built my team around Luis,' he added. 'We helped improve his game and he also helped our team.'

"At the end of last week familiar and worrying pictures emerged of Mario Balotelli from a Liverpool training session. Sitting on his backside on the grass at Melwood, the Italian centre forward looked as though he was being coaxed to his feet by Brendan Rodgers. Those who worked with Balotelli at Manchester City will have recognised the sketch straight away for whenever he used to make a mistake in training during his first stint in English football he would simply fall over. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Head to head: Mario Balotelli vs Diego Costa . Brendan Rodgers helps Mario Balotelli up during a training session at Melwood . Balotelli looks dejected as he misses a chance for Liverpool at QPR on Sunday . Balotelli is still without a Premier League goal for Liverpool since his move in the summer . A younger man back then, Balotelli's behaviour was interpreted by coaching staff at City as that of a player trying to hide embarrassment by feigning injury. It was endearing, for about a session-and-a-half. Then it wasn't. 'I had never seen anything like it,' said one of Roberto Mancini's coaches. 'When Mario made a mistake – like a wayward shot or a poor corner – he would often fall over, as though he was hurt. 'It was like watching a kid trying to cover up a mistake. 'It was ridiculous and, in the end, we just recognised it as classic Mario. Balotelli takes time out during Manchester City training as he watches on and sits on a ball . Former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini remonstrates with Balotelli during training at City . 'When things go wrong, his first instinct is not to put them right but to look for excuses.' As Balotelli's career stalls on the runway at Liverpool, Rodgers and his staff should be concerned. The Liverpool manager has a brilliant record at Anfield of improving players. He has improved Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson, for example. He even managed to improve Luis Suarez. It's one of his qualities as a coach. It may just be, though, that he has taken on too much with Balotelli. The signs of a downward spiral are already In place. Balotelli looks dejected during his days at City as the club drew with Ajax in the Champions League . Balotelli's form looks to be a long way from that which saw him reveal the 'Why Always Me?' T-shirt in 2011 . On Sunday at Loftus Road, the 24-year-old did not concentrate as much as he should, he did not work as hard as he should and, as a result, he did not execute in front of goal as well as he should. One of the problems with the former Milan striker is that – deep down – he lacks mental strength and confidence. It is why he was so reluctant to mix socially during his time at City, why at times Mancini's own son had to be sent to coax him from his flat in Manchester city centre. Balotelli has never really grasped what it takes to overcome difficulty. He reacts to adversity the wrong way. At Loftus Road, young Sterling reacted to his own recent difficulties by running his legs in to the ground. He's back on track already. Balotelli has another unsuccessful shot on goal during the win over QPR . Balotelli slumps on the ground after he misses another chance against QPR . Balotelli took a different route, though, and seeing video clips of him shooting from hopelessly ambitious positions, it was easy to remember him doing the same in the light blue of City and the dark blue colours of Italy during the summer's World Cup. That's a classic Balotelli response to draining confidence. Just hit it and hope that something amazing happens. All too often it doesn't. Unfortunately for Rodgers, Balotelli's current issues will start to affect team-mates at Melwood. They will react negatively to his aimless training efforts and his inability to bring something to the team even when his goalscoring form is beyond him. One can only hope that something happens for him against Real Madrid on Wednesday night. It needs to happen soon. For history tells us that when Balotelli gets stuck in the wrong direction, he soon gathers all the negative momentum of a lorry heading for the edge of a cliff.

"Ronny Deila got the required ruthlessness from his Celtic side as they routed bottom side Ross County in their Premiership clash in Dingwall. Pressure on the Hoops boss had increased following the shock home defeat to Hamilton in their last outing which meant 10 points had been shipped in eight games. The Norwegian claimed missed chances had cost the Parkhead side dearly against Accies but there was no such accusation to be made in the Highlands as goals from John Guidetti, Callum McGregor, Anthony Stokes and Jason Denayer had the points safe by the interval. John Guidetti celebrates after scoring the opening goal in Celtic's rout of Ross County . Stokes grabbed his second with a long-distance drive in the 56th minutes as the champions made a statement of intent to the rest of the league. It will be with some much-needed confidence that Celtic turn their attention to the home Europa League game against Romanian side Astra on Thursday night albeit Guidetti will again have to drop out as he was not registered in time to play in the group stages. County had had taken four points from their previous six but they were put firmly in their place and can only hope that this stinging defeat does not linger as they continue their battle to get away from the relegation zone. The international break had allowed some Celtic injuries to clear and Deila brought back Mikael Lustig, Charlie Mulgrew and McGregor . Efe Ambrose and Mubarak Wakaso started among the substitutes with Kris Commons out altogether. Ross County boss Jim McIntyre gave a debut to 32-year-old Canada midfielder Terry Dunfield, signed after leaving Oldham in the summer, with another new signing Paul Quinn on the bench, while on-loan midfielder Jackson Irvine was unable to play against his parent club. Anthony Stokes rounds off the victory for Celtic as they recover from their defeat by Hamilton Accies . Ross County keeper Mark Brown looks on as Stokes' shot hits the back of the net . The visiting fans made themselves heard as the game took shape in the early stages and they soon had plenty to sing about. Guidetti's opener in the 11th minute came after referee Bobby Madden awarded a foul for a challenge on him by Staggies' stopper Scott Boyd. Mulgrew got a head to Stokes' free-kick and it took a deflection before landing at the feet of the Swedish striker who swept the ball in from close range. Guidetti, on loan from Manchester City, was involved in the visitors' second goal three minutes later when he ran on to a Stefan Johansen pass and cut the ball back for the unmarked McGregor to steer past County keeper Mark Brown. It was all too easy for the Parkhead men. Left-back Graham Carey's free-kick forced Hoops keeper Craig Gordon to punch clear but it was hardly a rousing response from the beleaguered home side. In the 26th minute Guidetti fired wide of the far post from an angle but on the half-hour mark Stokes was more accurate with his curling effort from the edge of the box, after taking a pass from Johansen, the ball evading Brown and nestled in the corner of the net. Number four came in the 35th minute after Lustig's shot from a Johansen corner was blocked by Brown only to fall to Denayer who rifled it high into the net from close range. Stokes (centre) celebrates making it five for Celtic as they cruised in Dingwall . The home side could only hope to avoid an avalanche as Celtic pressed relentlessly with Boyd's goal line clearance with seconds of the first-half remaining preventing Johansen making it five. McIntyre had replaced Darren Barr with Michael Gardyne in the first-half and used his other two substitutes for the start of the second-half, Quinn replacing Boyd and Jake Jervis on for Yoann Arquin. Deila had to make a substitution of his own in the 52nd minute after left-back Emilio Izaguirre was carried off on a stretcher after a challenge by Gardyne, to be replaced by Adam Matthews. Four minutes later, the unchallenged Stokes fired in number five from 20 yards via the post which took County into embarrassing territory. As Celtic understandably dropped the tempo, Gardyne sent a shot from 20 yards crashing off the post. At the other end, in the 78th minute, Brown saved from McGregor after the Hoops midfielder ran clear on goal, before Stefan Scepovic, on for Guidetti, sent his drive inches wide of the post.

"Rangers striker Kenny Miller has warned runaway Scottish Championship leaders Hearts to beware a new rival in the title race: complacency. The Tynecastle side are currently unbeaten after nine matches and sit nine points ahead of second place Rangers, who play Raith Rovers at Ibrox on Saturday. But veteran striker Miller, who has been over the course before in title races with Rangers and Celtic, believes that getting to the top of the table is far easier than dealing with the pressure of turning being so far out in front to getting over the winning line. Kenny Miller, in training on Friday, warns runaway Scottish Championship leaders Hearts of complacency . Miller, in training with his team-mates, has won four Scottish Premier League titles at Celtic and Rangers . ‘I don’t know any of the Hearts lads really so I don’t know their attitude or mentality but if you are ahead by nine points, complacency can maybe creep in,’ said Miller. ‘It could be “we could afford to draw here” or “we can afford to lose, we are still (top)” but that’s a dangerous way of thinking. ‘Seeing out a title race is the hardest thing in the world to do. You can be miles and miles ahead but to get that last win and get across the line is a difficult thing to do. The pressure does mount. ‘We have got the experience in our dressing room of having to go through it on the final day or of having to win an Old Firm game to claw back into the title race. The Scot, holding the SPL trophy, says pressure and experience start telling the further a title race progresses . ‘Of course I’d rather be 15 points in front than behind and chasing but we are currently nine points back and it doesn’t sit right with us. We are looking to put that right. ‘But the way Hearts are going it looks like the title race will go down to the wire.’ Miller insisted it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Hearts can complete a league season without defeat. But he warned Robbie Neilson’s men the longer they remain unbeaten the more their Championship rivals will now be gunning to take them down. He said: ‘They are nine games in, 25 per cent of the way there, so I wouldn’t say it is unrealistic. But we will have a big say in that, as will the other teams. ‘The longer that run goes on, the more other teams are motivated to put an end to that run. They might see teams raising their game more against them, like teams have done against us this season. Lewis Macleod scores an acrobatic winner for Rangers against Livingston before the international break . ‘There are a lot of things that come into it when you are trying to win a title. Pressure and experience might start telling and injuries and suspensions creep in. ‘There’s a million and one things can turn a title challenge on its head but we have got to focus on ourselves. We know that if we play the way we can play, we have got 28 games to go, and if we do what we can do then we will win the league. If we don’t then it will be tough.’ It was a point taken up by Hearts boss Neilson who insisted Hearts have become a huge scalp for the opposition, with their rivals desperate to end the Gorgie outfit’s unbeaten start to the campaign. Part-time Dumbarton, who they face on Saturday, have come the closest following September’s goal-less draw. Hearts manager Robbie Neilson has guided his side to top of the Scottish Championship after nine matches . And Neilson said: ‘Dumbarton are very dangerous and every team wants to be the first team that beats us now. ‘It was the same at Alloa last week, they wanted to be the first team to beat us. ‘They played very well and made it difficult but we managed to grind it out, it will be the same on Saturday. ‘It’s difficult for teams at the top of the league when sides come and are happy with a 0-0, it’s up to us to break them down and I would be doing exactly the same if I was in Ian Murray’s position. They’ll try and kill the game and slow it down, then maybe nick it. Hearts players celebrate during their unbeaten start to the season, but Miller has warned of complacency . ‘But you can sense that determination from my boys to keep this run going. There is a determination in the squad to try and win the league, that’s what we want to do. “There is a confidence there that is growing and growing and we’ll continue to nurture it, but also be ready for the time when we do lose a game.’ Kenny Miller was speaking to promote Armed Forces Day. Over 200 service personnel and veterans will be at Ibrox today as Rangers honour the armed forces.","Hearts lead the Scottish Championship and are unbeaten after nine games .

"It was the Champions League against the Championship. A striker currently spearheading the favourites to win Europe’s elite club tournament against a central defence drawn from England’s second tier. Their respective profiles and earning power would suggest only one winner. But there are still some things that Robert Lewandowski’s reputed £150,000-a-week salary at Bayern Munich can’t buy. A goal against Scotland is one of them. Russell Martin and Gordon Greer, of Norwich City and Brighton and Hove Albion respectively, looked this superstar striker in the eye and vowed they would not let him score. Poland's Robert Lewandowski (left) reacts after a challenge by Scotland's Gordon Greer . Scotland's Russell Martin (right) is put under pressure by Poland star Lewandowski . They were as good as that intention demanded. Yet keeping Lewandowski under wraps came at a price elsewhere. The thumping equaliser netted by Arkadiusz Milik was a painful blow given how well Scotland had done to recover from losing a sloppy opening goal. Perhaps, though, any sense of disappointment at only drawing away to a team who had just sunk the world champions is a sign of how far Gordon Strachan’s side have come. This could yet prove to be a vital point on the long and winding road towards Euro 2016. Lewandowski had set up the clinching second goal in Poland’s historic win over Germany on Saturday, but was mainly reduced to a frustrated figure as Tuesday night’s match unfolded. Time and again, Martin and Greer denied him space or forced him out of the danger zone. Only once did he manage to unleash his formidable power on David Marshall’s goal. It was met with a superb flying save from the Cardiff City goalkeeper. Yes, Scotland lack a global name to compare with Lewandowski but this was further evidence of how far a genuine team unit might take us. Lewandowski (bottom) stretches for the ball as Greer keeps close to the Poland frontman . Martin (left) and Scotland captain Scott Brown applaud the fans after claiming a point in Warsaw . What a stage this was for Greer to make his competitive debut for Scotland after four friendly outings. Two months short of his 34th birthday, only Celtic great Ronnie Simpson has entered international football at such an advanced age. Having precious qualification points at stake may have been a new experience for Greer but, oddly enough, playing in this stadium wasn’t. He was part of the team that recorded a 1-0 friendly win here in March. Alongside him stood Martin, who has become one of the first names on Strachan’s team-sheet in recent months. Like Greer, the door to his progression was opened by injuries to colleagues. A starring role in the remarkable 1-0 win over Croatia in June of last year confirmed his capability to be an effective international performer. Neither was overawed by what they encountered in the Stadion Naradowy, a ground which is one of the most impressive in European football. Constructed for the Euro 2012 finals, four giant television screens hang from a central column its retractable roof. They featured the face of former Motherwell defender Tom Hateley in the countdown to kick off. Now with Slask Wroclaw, the full-back warned his adopted homeland not to expect old-fashioned route-one football from Strachan’s side. One thing the locals do not need a lesson in is how to sing a national anthem. The ground reverberated to the noise of Mazurek Dabrowskiego as plastic banners turned the stands into one giant Poland flag. Lewandowski has his eye on the ball during the Euro 2016 Group D qualifier between Poland and Scotland . The Tartan Army celebrate in Warsaw after Naismith's goal puts Scotland 2-1 ahead . The euphoria that filled this place after a first-ever victory over Germany was still lingering some 72 hours on. Dampening that rampant positivity and injecting some doubt had to be the early aim. Instead Alan Hutton arrived with a gift for Krzysztof Maczynski to fire Poland into an 11th minute lead via David Marshall’s left-hand post. It was a sign of Scotland’s confidence, however, that the recovery was both prompt and effective. Seven minutes was all it took for a fine move to end with Shaun Maloney placing the ball beyond Wojciech Szczesny. Around the first half flurries, the battle to contain Lewandowski was unfolding. Martin won the first direct duel with a thumping challenge near the touchline that rebounded off the Pole to bring a Scotland throw. It set the tone for the opening period as Strachan’s defence worked tirelessly to deny the 26-year-old space. Greer tested his fortitude with a crunching block on an attempted shot from 25 yards out. Lewandowski writhed in the ground in pain and continued chirping in the direction of Spanish referee Alberto Mallenco. If Greer’s intention was lay down a marker, to remind his illustrious opponent that he would not be cowed by reputation, then it seemed to have the desired effect. To help Martin and Greer in their quest, Strachan had opted to drop Andrew Robertson in favour of the superior physique provided by Steven Whittaker. There was no doubt the Poles were a powerful side and Whittaker’s selection was justified by one moment late in the first half. Scotland players celebrate after Steven Naismith (third left) gave the visitors a 2-1 lead against Poland . James Morrison (left) and Scotland manager Gordon Strachan leave the field after claiming a point . It looked for all the vodka in Warsaw that Lewandowski would score after Waldemar Sobota got in behind Hutton and delivered a ball that eliminated the centre-backs. Whittaker, though, stole in from the striker’s blind side with a terrific covering challenge that rescued the situation. Greer had been keeping things simple and steady in most of his work but allowed one pass to carelessly bobble him. Lewandowski was onto it in a flash but, just as he turned to home in on goal, he found Martin blocking his path. No-one could complain about the communication between the Championship pairing over the first 45 minutes. There were times in the second period when it was more fraught, despite Steven Naismith putting Scotland in front. The Bayern man was an inch or two away on getting his toe on the end a cross from the excellent Milik, before Marshall was finally required to deny him in impressive style. Lewandowski will now return to Bavaria with the club game’s greatest prizes in his sights. The aims of Martin and Greer are more modest, but on Tuesday night they were all equals.","Robert Lewandowski failed to score in Poland's 2-2 draw with Scotland .

"Sergio Aguero was a goal away from joining the elitist of Premier League clubs on Saturday - but did become Manchester City's all-time top Premier League scorer. The striker scored all four goals in  City's thumping 4-1 victory over Tottenham at the Etihad, but also missed a penalty. He has now scored 61 Premier League goals - moving ahead of Carlos Tevez's in City's all-time list. Had the 26-year-old scored his second spot kick – he took three during the match, scoring two – he would have become only the fifth player to score five goals in a Premier League match.

Sergio Aguero sent goalkeeper Hugo Lloris the wrong way when converting his first penalty of the afternoon . Aguero reels away having put Manchester City back in front against Tottenham on Saturday . Aguero celebrates his four-goal haul . Nonetheless, Aguero did add his name to the list of players to score four goals in a game in what proved a memorable performance. Aguero opened the scoring after 13 minutes for the hosts, before Christian Eriksen replied almost instantly for Spurs after a slip from Fernando let the visitors in. The Argentine then went on to restore City's lead as he slotted home from the spot, before missing another penalty before the break. Aguero then netted another penalty and scored another impressive strike after the interval as City ran out convincing winners. Last season Manuel Pellegrini suggested Aguero was behind only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo among the world's best players and, now he has apparently overcome the numerous injuries that have plagued him ever since, the City boss is again of similar opinion. Pellegrini said: 'It was not easy for Kun last year when he had too many injuries. You can't put in performances like he did today when you're not 100 per cent fit. Sergio Aguero's four-goal haul against Tottenham makes him Manchester City's all-time top Premier League scorer. Sergio Aguero - 61 goals (95 games) Carlos Tevez - 58 goals (113 games) Edin Dzeko - 48 goals (115 games) Yaya Toure - 42 goals (141 games) Nicolas Anelka - 37 goals (89 games) 'But now he's working very well. Maybe he will not score four goals in a game again but he will demonstrate why everyone says he's one of the best players in the world. 'I have said before he could be a Ballon d'Or player. 'I have known him a lot of years. I saw his career in Argentina and Spain before he came to England and that's why I say he'd one of the three or four most important strikers in the world - not (just) because he scored four goals.'","Manchester City striker scored four goals against Tottenham .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes Daniel Sturridge will never be considered one of the best strikers in Europe until he starts playing more regularly. The forward hasn't featured since August, making just three Premier League appearances before getting injured on England duty. Sturridge scored 22 goals and struck up a lethal strike partnership with Luis Suarez last term as Liverpool finished second behind Manchester City. Daniel Sturridge needs to play more regularly to be considered one of the best strikers in Europe, according to Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers . Sturridge scored on the opening day of the Premier League season but has not played since August . Injured Sturridge watched on from the stands as Liverpool struggled to score against Hull at Anfield . Liverpool WITH Sturridge . Games: 3 . Goals scored by Sturridge: 1 .

However, manager Rodgers believes the former City and Chelsea forward needs to play more consistently before he is considered one of the best frontmen on the continent. 'He won’t become a top European striker until he plays consistently. It doesn’t matter about potential. You have to play,' said Rodgers. Liverpool have missed Sturridge's goals and Rodgers is keen to get the striker back in the team and scoring. 'Top players have such an influence on the team,' said Rodgers. 'When you are under the cosh, you know that you have strikers who can score out of nothing. 'When you have that as a team, it is a big weapon. Sturridge is one of them. That is where we aim to get with Daniel.' Despite missing the last two months of the season, the Liverpool boss is confident Sturridge will be firing on all cylinders when he makes his comeback. Last season's lethal strike partnership of Luis Suarez and Sturridge contributed  53 Premier League goals . 'When he comes back into the team, you will see the confidence because of the movement and the dynamic. But he isn’t fit and he hasn’t been for a long time.' Also without Suuarez - who joined Barcelona in the summer, Liverpool have struggled to reach last season's heights so far this campaign and Rodgers added: 'He (Sturridge) isn’t fit and he hasn’t been for a long time. We just have to work without and while we are doing that, we are staying up and around the top end of the table. 'Everyone can see our conditions are different to work in this season.

"It's emerged a disabled football fan who claimed to be the first ever wheelchair bound coach working in the professional game when he joined Manchester United this season was never employed by the club. Sohail Rehman, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, announced last August he would be working for Manchester United Soccer Schools as coach for teenagers who go for United trials, as well as visiting schools to train children. Sohail Rehman said he would be working for Manchester United Soccer Schools as a coach for teenagers . Sohail Rehman had helped out as coach for Sunday league matches and tournaments in Yorkshire . Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson wrote to encourage Sohail Rehman . This led to Rehman getting considerable publicity including interviews with BBC Radio 5 Live, Soccer AM, talkSPORT and BBC North West. Rehman, who had received a letter of congratulations about his coaching qualifications from Sir Alex Ferguson said at the time: ‘Big thanks to David Moyes, I did a coaching session at United and after that he was basically saying how impressed he was with me. He wanted to get me on board with the club, he started everything off.’ A United spokesman was also quoted as saying: ‘Since coming to the training ground, everyone at Manchester United has welcomed Sohail with open arms.’ Rehman admited he questioned his own ability to coach players as he cannot play the game himself . Rehman believed his analysis was strong enough to get him into the Premier League . However United cannot trace anyone at the club responsible for that and other comments and a spokesman said: ‘Sohail Rehman has never been engaged or employed by any company owned by Manchester United, Manchester United Foundation, or Manchester United Soccer Schools. He has a letter from Sir Alex Ferguson because Sir Alex used to write letters of encouragement to young coaches and to individuals who have overcome adversity in their lives. ‘It is not an endorsement of his credentials. Sohail watched training as a participant in a Dream Day that the club regularly delivers for disadvantaged young people.’ Rehman was unavailable for comment.

"Celtic defender Adam Matthews remembers Celtic being written off during his first season at Parkhead before bouncing back to claim the title. Now the Welsh defender insists Ronny Deila's men can do the same. The shock 1-0 defeat to Hamilton 10 days ago means the Scottish champions have dropped 10 Scottish Premiership points this season. Celtic defender Adam Matthews is refusing to press the panic button despite his side's worrying form . Celtic slumped to a shock 1-0 loss to Hamilton; the Scottish champions have dropped 10 points this season . They trail table-topping Accies by six points as they languish in sixth place, albeit having played a game less. That miserable start to the campaign has left their new Norwegian boss in the firing line of frustrated fans. But Matthews says Celtic can learn a lesson from the team which fought back from a 3-0 half-time deficit against Kilmarnock three years ago as they looked set to drop 18 points behind rivals Rangers. The full-back told the Celtic View: 'The main thing is to have a good team spirit. In my first season, we won the league and we won the league and we were 15 points behind at one stage, but just after Christmas we were one point ahead. These are worrying times for Ronny Deila's men at Parkhead as Celtic sit on sixth place in the League table . 'A big turning point was the game at Kilmarnock. Being 3-0 down at half-time, people felt that was it and we were going to be 18 points behind in the league so it may have been too much. 'But getting the three goals in the second half and getting the draw gave us a boost of confidence that we could go on a good run and that's what happened. 'So you need to have a good team spirit and stay together. That team were good at doing that and I'm sure this one can be as well. 'Every time we lose, especially the next day, the atmosphere isn't great and we are all a bit quiet and down. 'Overall, though, the boys are upbeat and are looking good in training. In parts of the game against Hamilton, we looked like a good team, but we just need to do that for the full 90 minutes, and if we can do that then we can go on a long unbeaten run. 'It's a bad start for us but with the players we have, we can put a good run together and I'm sure we can climb back up the league. 'We just need to keep calm, keep doing what we are doing in training and then do that when we play at the weekend.' Matthews is hoping to make his Celtic return soon after missing the last six weeks with a groin injury. The 22-year-old has not played since limping off at half-time during the 1-1 draw with Dundee on August 31. The former Cardiff man - whose current side face Ross County in Dingwall on Saturday - said: 'It's always frustrating being injured. 'You obviously want to be out there helping the boys but I'm sure we will get it together and click soon. 'Some of the football we have been playing has been good but we just haven't managed to get the results we have wanted. 'I felt good in pre-season and the way the team was playing suits me as a full-back, so I was enjoying it. Everyone gets injuries so I can't get too down about it and just need to try to get fit and back in the team.'","Scottish champions have dropped 10 Premiership points this season .

"Ally McCoist is confident that he will remain in charge at Rangers despite Mike Ashley's apparent power grab at Ibrox. Rumours began circulating earlier on Monday that manager McCoist might be the next through the exit door - something shareholder Sandy Easdale was moved to deny.. At his afternoon press conference on Monday, McCoist said: ‘I spoke to the chairman this morning and I've spoken to Sandy this morning. It was very decent to phone me and give an update.

It gives me an opportunity to thank Graham for his work at the club.’ News that the crisis-hit Scottish club had accepted the Newcastle United owner’s offer of a £2million loan was announced to the Stock Exchange on Monday morning - along with confirmation that chief executive Graham Wallace had resigned. That followed Philip Nash’s resignation from Ibrox on Friday, with Ashley now set to insert his own people having recently called for both men to depart and demanding an EGM. That demand has been withdrawn, with the English businessman seemingly the real power behind the throne at Ibrox now having seen off the likes of Dave King and Brian Kennedy, who had both offered financial aid to the club.

"Manchester United are now able to mix it with the best after the turbulence of the last year, claims Gary Neville. Robin van Persie's stoppage time equaliser handed Louis van Gaal's side a deserved point against Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday.

'They'd have been deflated – because they did play well in the game – to come out and lose. It will feel like a win. 'The performance level, forget the result, but the performance level was a higher level than Manchester United have produced all season against an excellent team; the best team in the league. 'They had to step up a level today and they did.

"Alan Pardew saw his half-time rant pay off instantly as Newcastle fought back to beat Tottenham 2-1 and climb out of the relegation zone. After Emmanuel Adebayor had given the hosts an early lead, the under-fire Toon boss tore into his players at the break and sent on striker Sammy Ameobi, who equalised six seconds after the restart. Fellow substitute Remy Cabella then set up Ayoze Perez's winner. Alan Pardew turned Newcastle's game at Tottenham with two substitutions and an angry team talk . 'There were a few strong words,' admitted Pardew. 'I reminded them about the fundamentals of a Premier League game and we came out with a much stronger attitude. Sammy Ameobi (centre) celebrates equalising for Newcastle after coming on as a half-time substitute . Ayoze Perez then marked his first start for Newcastle with the winning goal for Pardew's side . 'We were a bit unlucky because we lose Papiss [Cisse] just two hours before the game . 'We'd worked all week thinking that he'd be fine so it was a bit of a shock to lose him. His knee was swollen today as a reaction to yesterday's training. 'So we had to go with Perez and I knew that probably wouldn't suit him but we needed to give it a go because of the way we'd worked all week. 'We were giving too much possession to Tottenham, too much space.' Pardew celebrates Newcastle's victory over Tottenham with John Carver, (right) his assistant manager . Pardew deserves credit for the half-time introductions of Ameobi and Cabella - a move he said was down to offering a threat. It clearly helped move Newcastle's performance up a level, as did his half-time 'team talk'. He added: 'We just said to them after, it's not nice as a manager to go in and bark out orders but sometimes it's necessary just to shake people up because we needed shaking up.' Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino (above) believes his side are lacking in mental strength . Striker Emmanuel Adebayor (centre) had headed Tottenham into the lead in the 18th minute . Things would have been so different had Spurs showed a cutting edge in the first half. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino believes they deserved more from a display undone by Ameobi's sucker punch. 'It was a shock because after that it all changed in this moment,' said the Argentinian, who was not even back in his seat when the substitute scored. 'Seven or six seconds before, all was happiness and there was good energy in the stadium. Our supporters were happy and believed that we would get a good result. 'But in this moment, I think it was difficult to manage in our head. Our heads had gone and we started to take rash decisions on the pitch. Remy Cabella (centre) was another second half substitution that helped turn the game in Newcastle's favour . 'It was difficult because 12 or 14 minutes later, we conceded again another goal. At 2-1, it was difficult.' Pochettino's main complaint after the match was the lack of mental strength displayed by the Tottenham squad. It undid what he called their best half of their season on what is not the first time the Spurs boss has bemoaned his players' mentality. 'It is not something where you can analyse the action, sort the tactical situation and move the players,' Pochettino said. Erik Lamela had an uninspiring game after impressing in midweek in the Europa League for Tottenham . 'With mentality, we need to work hard. It is not easy. We need to be more strong, like a team. This is our challenge. 'We need to speak, we need to create a different situation on the training ground and work. 'We know how but always you need to spend time to work in this area. It is not the same as in physical or tactical situations. It is a different area.'","Alan Pardew unimpressed as Newcastle trailed Tottenham 1-0 at half-time .

"Manchester United midfielder Adnan Januzaj has been given the honour of taking on Ryan Giggs' famous No 11 shirt next season, but Louis van Gaal fueled speculation of more summer signings by leaving three first-team numbers unfilled. United have not replaced Rio Ferdinand in the number five shirt, while numbers seven and nine remain unused, with Louis van Gaal looking to bring in signings before the season starts. The club said on twitter that any new signings will be handed shirt numbers that are currently vacant. VIDEO Scroll down for Manchester United's Ryan Giggs and Adnan Januzaj freestyling . Honour: Adnan Januzaj has been handed Ryan Giggs' famous No 11 shirt for next season . Promise: The  winger was excellent in patches last season and has been rewarded with the iconic jersey . Legend: Giggs wore the No 11 shirt for virtually his entire 23-year playing career at Old Trafford . Moving up: Giggs (right) retired from playing in May and is now assistant manager to Louis van Gaal (left) Januzaj moves from the number 44 to take up the iconic 11 jersey, while new signings Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera will wear the numbers three and 21 respectively. Giggs, who was the only previous holder of the 11 shirt, called time on his 23-year playing career at Old Trafford at the end of last season after briefly becoming the club's caretaker boss following the sacking of David Moyes. He has since become assistant manager to Louis van Gaal, leaving the shirt number he occupied for almost his entire time at United free. Januzaj, who wore No 44 after breaking into the first team last season, will take on Giggs' old number as he aims to secure himself a regular place in Van Gaal's plans. Some clubs have decided to retire the number of their most long-serving players, with West Ham choosing to no longer hand out Bobby Moore's No 6 shirt and AC Milan opting against using No 3 after Paolo Maldini hung up his boots. 1. De Gea; 2. Rafael; 3. Shaw; 4. Jones; 6. Evans; 8. Mata; 10. Rooney; 11. Januzaj; 12. Smalling; 13. Lindegaard; 14. Chicharito; 16. Carrick; 17. Nani; 18. Young; 19. Welbeck; 20. van Persie; 21. Herrera; 22. Powell; 23. Cleverley; 24. Fletcher; 25. Valencia; 26. Kagawa; 28. Anderson; 29. Zaha; 30. Varela; 31. Fellaini; 34. Lawrence; 35. Lingard; 36. Vermijl; 38. M Keane; 39. Thorpe; 40. Amos; 41. James; 42. Blackett; 45. Petrucci; 46. Rothwell; 48. W Keane; 49. Wilson; 50. Johnstone. But speaking to MUTV in July, Giggs confirmed that he didn't want United to follow suit. Asked whether his No 11 shirt should be retired, the 40-year-old said: 'No. There are obviously special cases but it just depends on the club really. 'I don't think it's [right] for United where they constantly churn over great players. I haven't thought about who will take over the number 11 shirt - that's a good question. 'They're under pressure, aren't they? I look forward to seeing who takes it and wish them all the best.' Januzaj, who signed a new five-year contract with the Red Devils in October, is the player chosen to follow in Giggs' esteemed footsteps. The 19-year-old made 27 Premier League appearances last season, scoring four goals as United finished in a disappointing seventh place. Famous: Giggs won a host of honours including 13 Premier League titles and two Champions League trophies while wearing the No 11 shirt . Bright future: Januzaj, pictured celebrating a goal against West Ham, broke into United's first team last season . While Januzaj has taken on his new shirt from a club legend, Giggs also revealed that he was given the No 11 shirt simply because of how teams used to be numbered in the early 1990s. He said: 'I wore number seven for a few games, when the shirts were just numbered one to 11. 'But 11 was usually worn by the left winger so it really just happened [that I kept it when squad numbers were introduced].'","Louis van Gaal leaves three shirt numbers blank ahead of new season fueling speculation of major new signings .

"Brian Kennedy staged a desperate 11th hour bid on Friday night to thwart Mike Ashley’s move for control at Rangers on an incredible day in the Ibrox power battle. The Sale Sharks owner, who joined forces with the Blue Knights in a failed attempt to take the club out of administration in 2012, staged a shock return by tabling an emergency funding offer that would see Rangers through to their AGM. It was a response to Ashley - who this week snubbed Dave King’s £16million bail-out plan - putting forward his own offer of a loan to the crisis-hit outfit. Brian Kennedy prepares to talk to the media after his consortium's third bid to buy Rangers was knocked back . Kennedy staged a desperate 11th hour bid on Friday night to thwart Mike Ashley’s move for control at Rangers . Ashley  snubbed Dave King’s £16million bail-out plan and put forward an offer of a loan to the crisis-hit outfit . The Newcastle owner already has strong commercial links at the club via his retail agreements and is seen as holding the whip hand over its future as he tries to establish a boardroom powerbase. Rangers require new income to be certain of meeting next month’s wage bill. The Ibrox board were in talks over the competing proposals on Friday night and those discussions are expected to continue over the weekend. Rangers director Philip Nash has resigned from the Ibrox board, the club has announced to the Stock Exchange. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY . They will not feature Philip Nash after he resigned from the board earlier in a chaotic sequence of developments. Finance director Nash and chief executive Graham Wallace had been targeted by Ashley in his EGM call to try and remove both men. It is understood that Wallace on Friday began a long-arranged family holiday, despite the very awkward timing given the present circumstances. King questioned whether Nash had quit ‘as a matter of principle against something that is going on’ and also claimed Ashley’s move did not mean his own part in the power struggle was over. The Sports Direct tycoon’s offer is thought to be worth between £2m-£3m, which would see Rangers into the New Year. There could be future funding to follow that sum. However, if successful, Ashley wants Wallace out alongside Nash and to handpick the two directors who would take their places. One source close to Ashley said: ‘Rangers are in serious financial difficulty and require his immediate financial help.’ There were also claims he had offered Nash the chance to stay on as a consultant but not as part of the board. ‘Rangers are in serious financial difficulty and require (Ashley's) immediate financial help,’ one source said . It is not yet clear what other terms are attached to Ashley’s offer after reports the Londoner had sought control of Rangers’ trademark rights when in talks over a loan earlier this season. His firm currently earns 49 per cent of Rangers’ retail profits. Kennedy arrived in Glasgow on Friday as he put forward his alternative plan for short-term funding. The Edinburgh-born businessman is willing to provide cash to keep Rangers going until their AGM, at which point there could be a new share issue. That forms the central plank of the plan put forward by the group headed by King, but it requires the backing of 75 per cent of shareholders to gain a green light. Crucially, King was unable to reach an agreement with Sandy Easdale, who controls a 26 per cent block, during his recent visit to the UK. He returned to South Africa on Thursday after also revealing that Ashley – who has an 8.9 per cent stake – had blanked requests for a meeting. The Easdale block is believed to favour Ashley’s plan, but King was remaining defiant. ‘I don’t see the offer of a short term loan by Mr Ashley affecting me in any way,’ said King, who would see to appoint two new directors and have final say over the chairman if successful. ‘Our offer is for a long-term permanent solution that can take the club forward and unite the fans and the board for the first time in many years. The board is in the final stages of reviewing our offer and I expect a definitive answer early next week. Ashley's £2m-£3m offer would see Rangers into the New Year and there could be future funding to follow that . ‘Frankly, it doesn’t seem possible that the board can do anything other than recommend it to shareholders given the dire financial circumstances and the fact that no other long-term solution is on offer. ‘Mr Ashley’s involvement (and recently announced continued commitment) with Newcastle precludes him from making a similar offer of long-term permanent equity. ‘What Mr Ashley can do is attempt to increase his vice-like grip on the Rangers brand by improving his retail position as a condition for supplying short term debt to tide the club over until our permanent funding is in place. ‘But I know that there are other investors also willing to provide bridging finance. The board will therefore not have to accept punitive terms even if Ashley attempts to oppose them. ‘We must remember that the board is ethically and legally bound to act in the best interest of the company and all shareholders. Ashley cannot expect preferential treatment and will not get it.’ Nash was brought on board to try and stem the flow of money out of Rangers. It is expected that accounts likely to be issued next month will show that operating losses under his tenure were almost halved from the £14m of the previous financial year. A statement to the Stock Exchange confirmed his resignation and added: ‘The Board would like to thank Mr Nash for his significant contribution to the Company during what has been a particularly challenging period.’","Brian Kennedy staged 11th hour bid on Friday night to thwart Mike Ashley .

"Click here to see more from Republic of Ireland's win over Gibraltar in Sportsmail's brilliant Match Zone! Robbie Keane created another slice of history with the Republic of Ireland as they strolled to a 7-0 victory over Gibraltar in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Dublin. The Ireland captain’s first half hat-trick saw him go out in front as the leading all-time scorer in European qualifiers, overtaking Turkey’s Hakan Sukur and Denmark’s Jon Dahl Tomasson. The goals, his 19th, 20th, and 21st, all came in the first 18 minutes. And just to keep the numbers game going, his total tally now stands at 65, making him the 14th highest scorer in international history. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Ireland assistant Roy Keane reveal regrets about his own international career at book launch . Robbie Keane celebrates as he nets a hat-trick for the Republic of Ireland in just 14 first-half minutes against Gibraltar .

Referee: Leontios Trattou (Cyprus) James McClean helped himself to a brace while Gibraltar goalkeeper Jordan Perez found his own net with a comical own goal before Wes Hoolahan strolled into the box to slot in a seventh as if it was a five-a-side game. As if Perez’s day wasn’t bad enough, it came to a premature end on the hour mark when his boss, Allen Bula, decided to replace him. He was given a standing ovation by the home support as he departed for substitute Jamie Robba, and it was understandable. These Ireland fans know what it’s like to see their side hammered like this. Germany came to the Irish capital during the previous World Cup qualifying campaign and hit Ireland for six. The bad news for Gibraltar? The world champions are in Group D alongside them. They have now conceded 14 goals in their opening two fixtures, Ireland matching Poland’s 7-0 victory last month, and it looks as if it will be a long year ahead. It took Keane just six minutes to break the deadlock and ease any nerves of being frustrated by the visitors. Hoolahan had all the time in the world to turn and pick out his pass for Aiden McGeady on the right wing. The Everton star then provided his captain with an easy finish from six yards. Ten minutes later and Hoolahan was once again the creator. This time his chest control and first time ball for Keane sent the 34-year-old bearing down on goal. The Dubliner is advancing in years but he remains deadly when given the chance. Keane turns to celebrate after scoring the opening goal for Republic of Ireland after just four minutes .

The hat-trick was completed from the penalty spot after in the 18th minute and maybe if it was a few years earlier he would have thought about celebrating with a cartwheel. He knows better now. And Ireland showed their ruthlessness after the interval. Less than 30 seconds in and McClean tapped home from close range after Keane turned provider. The fifth had more than a hint of tragicomedy about it when Perez kicked into his own net after Scott Wiseman blocked Hoolahan’s initial effort on the line. There was no let up from the home side and McClean and Hoolahan both helped themselves to boost the goal difference for Martin O’Neill’s side. It means, for now, they top Group D.

"Germany are in crisis. Just three months after winning the World Cup in Brazil, Joachim Low’s team are already floundering in their Euro 2016 qualifying group. With  one win and one draw from their opening three games, the team have recorded the worst start to a qualifying campaign ever from a German or West German side. Even the scrappy victory against Scotland was hardly anything to cheer about, while defeat to Poland and a shock to draw to the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday evening have firmly knocked the wind out of German sails. The German media are already restless. Tagesspiegel joked that Gibraltar, one of Germany’s next opponents, would be planning for victory. Bild, meanwhile, were asking: 'how bad is the atmosphere among our World Cup winners?'. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reactions from John O'Shea and Martin O'Neill . John O'Shea equalises for Ireland in the fourth minute of injury time in their qualifier against Germany . The 1-1 draw means Germany have tasted victory in only one of their opening three Euro 2016 qualifiers . The answer was visible on the pitch after John O’Shea’s equaliser on Tuesday. The Germans walked off without a word to one another, no trace of the team spirit which earned them so much praise last summer. There were, however, no excuses. 'We can only blame ourselves,' said Jerome Boateng. 'When you lose the ball so easily at the end of a game, then late goals can happen.' Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was visibly upset. 'It’s incredibly irritating,' he said. 'We pretty much hadthe three points in the bag.' In truth, both against Poland and Ireland, Germany dominated the play, but were incapable of adding the finishing touch. Even with injuries to key players such as Bastian Schweinsteiger, Sami Khedira and Mesut Ozil this is a team which can boast the attacking qualities of Andre Schurrle, Mario Gotze, Thomas Muller and Toni Kroos. They should be beating Ireland, and they know it. Lukas Podolski, Erik Durm and Thomas Muller reflect on a disappointing night for the world champions . There are a whole host of reasons for these post-World Cup problems. The first, and most significant, is both mental and physical fatigue. They've lacked imagination and concentration in recent games, too. Dominating by default, they have expected the goals to come naturally, and they have been disappointed. The squad is also going through a minor upheaval. Sebastian Rudy, Karim Bellarabi and Chelsea target Antonio Rudiger have impressed in their first games for the national team. They will establish themselves fully over time, but they are yet to be part of what was rightly recognised as a very tight-knit unit of footballers. Even some of the members of the World Cup squad, such as Matthias Ginter, Erik Durm and Julian Draxler, also have very little international playing time under their belts. And then there is Philipp Lahm. It may sound like an easy excuse, but the loss of Germany’s captain is one problem which Low has so far been unable to solve. Pep Guardiola describes Lahm as the player in world football with the highest levels of concentration, and it is that kind of influence which Germany have been lacking in recent games. It is not just about leadership and experience, but also about Lahm’s on field intelligence – his ability to see and pick the gaps in opposing teams. Joachim Low cut a frustrated figure on the touchline as Germany drew with the Ireland on Tuesday . German fans still beleive Low is the man for the job despite the difficult start to the qualifying campaign . It does not help that new captain  Schweinsteiger is also out injured. Nonetheless, there were nine World Cup winners on the pitch against both Poland and Ireland, so it is a fair question which Welt newspaper posed, when they asked 'where are the leaders?' The question mark sums up the general reaction in Germany so far. Confusion reigns, rather than anger. Even the German fans, who are usually quite happy to boo an underachieving national team, were quieter than expected on Tuesday. They were too shocked, too confused. Low won over a lot of critics with his World Cup win. For the moment, Germany trusts that he is perfectly capable of turning the situation around, and building a reformed team to become European Champions in 2016. Any more results like those against Poland and Ireland, however, and the knives may be drawn again.","Germany are floundering in their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign .

"Frank Lampard will be able to extend his stay at Manchester City further into 2015 if his parent club New York City FC decide to hold a pre-season training camp in England. Lampard has quickly become an integral part of Manuel Pellegrini’s thinking at the Etihad Stadium, having impressed with goals and match-winning performances since joining on loan from City's sister club in August. With the American MLS season due to start in March and the 36-year-old initially expected to head to New York for pre-season sometime in the New Year, suggestions that City may try to keep hold of him a little longer have caused some consternation across the Atlantic. Frank Lampard could be at Manchester City until February if New York agree to pre-season training in England . The City loanee has bagged some important goals so far this term and could see his deal extended . However, it is understood one possibility that could help satisfy both clubs is  New York City using the English club’s new Etihad Campus training facility as a base for their own pre-season training camp in January or February. Recently opened, the theory is that City’s new £200m facility could host NYCFC for training and accommodation while the MLS team play two or three friendly games against local lower league opposition in the North West. This would enable Lampard to meet and spend time with his new team-mates while continuing to play for City as the NYCFC players went through stages of pre-season fitness work that he wouldn’t need. Lampard celebrates scoring for Manchester City with new team-mate Pablo Zabaleta . The former Chelsea star has been impressive in midfield for Manuel Pellegrini's side so far this term . City are aware the issue of Lampard’s availability is a sensitive one in America, where NYCFC have used the former England player’s impending arrival in marketing drives and to boost season ticket sales. However, Lampard has already proved valuable to Pellegrini, scoring four times before injuring his thigh against Tottenham last weekend. The former Chelsea star has said he will leave the decision about his future to the two clubs. Lampard has been a major hit at the Etihad and even netted against his former side Chelsea . Meanwhile, Lampard has an outside chance of recovering from injury ahead of City’s visit to another of his old clubs, West Ham, on Saturday. Lampard missed the Champions League trip to CSKA Moscow after being carried off on a stretcher against Tottenham last Saturday, but his thigh injury is not a serious one. It is understood he remains a doubt for the trip to Upton Park but if he does miss the match he should be back for next week. Lampard was voted City’s player of the month for September by fans and has already scored four goals for the club.

"Jake Livermore has quite literally been been prepared to go to Hull and back to make a name for himself. A former pupil of Enfield Grammar School, Livermore thought he had fulfilled his boyhood dreams when he joined Tottenham but he was never satisfied with sitting at the back of his class. 'I was a local boy and Tottenham are my club, ten minutes from my home, but I had to get away and if it meant going 200 miles to play regular football then so be it,' says the Hull City midfielder. Former Tottenham midfielder Jake Livermore has thrived at Hull City . 'It was my decision. I'd had too many broken promises over the years at Tottenham; coaches saying I would get my chance if I played well then you would find another eight midfielders suddenly ahead of you,' adds Livermore. 'Look at Ryan Mason. He's made the breakthrough now but it should have happened three years ago when he was playing even better in my opinion. 'I dipped my toe in the water with Hull by going on loan and found everything I wanted. I enjoyed every minute and Steve Bruce and his staff were straight-talking, there was no sugar coating, just this is how it is. It was a breath of fresh air.' The appreciation was mutual and Hull made him their then record £8million signing in the summer despite interest from the likes of Crystal Palace and others. Livermore is a personable character and it's quickly apparent that, after years of frustration, he is enjoying his football. Livermore joined Hull from Tottenham for £8million after a successful loan spell . His middle name is Cyril, 'after his grandfather, not the ex-Tottenham defender Cyril Knowles', though 'he was a decent footballer and passed on some good genes' and his nickname is 'Tache', or at least the only one he can repeat, which is owed to the pencil-thin moustache he has been cultivating albeit 'without much success'. However, while he has ambitions for his moustache, it is his reputation as a one of England's most promising midfielders that he would prefer to cultivate. Livermore has one England cap, awarded after he came on for Frank Lampard in a 2-1 win over Italy in 2012, and has been encouraged by Roy Hodgson's recent selections that he can maybe stake a claim to at least earn a second one. 'I've got a 100 percent record as an England player,' he laughs. 'I'd love to play for my country again. Mr Hodgson picked me that night and I'd love another chance. it's something all players aspire to. Fabian Delph has shown that if you continue to play well you can earn your reward and that has to be my aim at Hull. If I play well hopefully Mr Hodgson will take a look.' Livermore thought he had fulfilled his boyhood dreams when he joined Tottenham . Livermore, 24, is part of an exciting, fluid midfield alongside his pal Tom Huddlestone, Mohamed Elmohamady and Mohamed Diame at Hull but Saturday pits him against a player he has always used as his yardstick in Liverpool's Steven Gerrard. 'I used to study Luka Modric, who is a hell of a player, but Gerrard has been my hero since I turned professional,' enthuses Livermore. 'I played against him for Tottenham once when he was coming back from injury and I learned more in ten minutes than I did in four years from coaching. He not only had supreme confidence in his own ability but he gave it to those around him. 'He brought a calmness to their game and dictated the pace. As a midfielder, one of the most difficult aspects is finding space but his movement was such he made it look easy. If I emulate anything close to what he has done in the game it would be fantastic.' Livermore (right) believes at 24 he can add to his one cap for England . Not that Livermore will be standing back and admiring Liverpool's talisman on Saturday. 'He is a leader and he will be getting them up for the game after their result against Madrid but I'd like to earn respect by playing well against him. Whatever happened we would expect a tough game but we've got a good bunch here at Hull. 'People ask ''who's the joker in your group?'' but we have about 30 of them. We've got a great team spirit and plenty of quality. The manager has attracted players such as Curtis Davies, Abel Hernandez and Hatem Ben Arfa; nearly all of us are players with something to prove who have been given a second chance. That gives us a certain edge. 'I thought I'd got rid of Michael Dawson! But he followed me here because he knew we were building something special. Like myself and Tom, he still wants to show what he can do and it means we are putting together a few surprise performances like we did at Arsenal last week.' Roy Hodgson take note, everyone deserves a second chance.","Jake Livermore was forced to leave his boyhood club for regular football .

"Just 13 games in to the Sky Bet Championship season and we have already had five different league leaders. The latest of those, Derby County, ascended to the top of the table with a 1-0 win at Blackpool on Tuesday night. It was their fifth victory in seven games. Perhaps more poignantly, Derby are unbeaten in 10 games. Yes, four of those results have been draws, some not pretty, but they only serve to demonstrate the resiliance which makes the Rams arguably the most likely of the five table-toppers so far this season to be there come May 2. Chris Martin steps up to slot home Derby's winner at Bloomfield Road on Tuesday night . Johnny Russell (right) leads the celebrations after Martin scored the only goal of the game . Steve McClaren consoles defender Richard Keogh after Wembley's play-off final defeat by QPR . The quartet of Watford, Norwich, Nottingham Forest and to a lesser extent Bournemouth have the attacking flair to challenge Derby for automatic promotion, but may all lack the consistency to keep in touch with Steve McClaren's relentless Rams. Since the former England manager took the helm at the iPro Stadium just over a year ago, Derby have maintained a handy knack of churning out points, only losing consecutive matches twice and never going more than four games without a win. In fact, were McClaren in charge for more than 36 games last season, then surely Derby would have joined Midlands rivals Leicester in the automatic promotion places, rather than being consigned to that agonising defeat by QPR at Wembley (which the quality of their football simply did not deserve). It seems almost incredible to think of the furious fallout from Nigel Clough's sacking in late September last year given McClaren's popularity in Derby. Clough's foundation work has to be appreciated; much of McClaren's side was inherited from the now-Sheffield United boss, but the 'Wally with the Brolly' has truly rebuilt his reputation on these shores. European football aficionados will point out that he did that when winning the Dutch league with the unfashionable Twente in 2010, but it was very much out of sight, out of mind with regards to McClaren for the English football fan. Given his success in Holland, adopting the same fluid 4-3-3 system he uses at Derby, McClaren was expected to bring verve and flair to the iPro, which he has, but it has been his ability to get the best out of seasoned Football League pros that has impressed and surprised most in the last year. While neither started on Tuesday night, defender Jake Buxton and midfielder John Eustace have been key men for Derby in the last year, McClaren getting them to fit in to a modern, European system despite their reputations as uncompromising journeymen. Derby's two key men over the last year, striker Chris Martin and midfielder Craig Bryson, were both underperforming under Clough, but now look like two of the best players outside the Premier League, and more then capable of making the step up. Chris Martin has been a revelation since McClaren took over and has scored 10 goals already this season . McClaren has continued to put faith in youth as Clough did before him, with academy-product midfielders Jeff Hendrick and Will Hughes flourishing in the first-team and Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe excelling on loan, just as fellow Red Andre Wisdom did the season before. All in all, it has been a brilliant year or so for Derby under McClaren, with 34 wins coming from 56 games; the Rams losing just 10 games. The only blot on the copybook being that last minute Bobby Zamora strike at Wembley. The last two champions in the second tier, Leicester and Cardiff, got their noses out in front early and never looked back. It's taken Derby 13 games to get to the top - and McClaren 13 months - but they may just be there for good. Good week for… SHREWSBURY. The last four days could not have gone any better for Micky Mellon’s side. Two wins, six points, six goals scored, zero conceded. Pre-season promotion favourites in League Two, Shrewsbury started strongly but a run of just one win in six games had seen them slip some way off the automatic places. Tuesday night’s 5-0 thrashing of pace-setters Bury bodes well though; it’s now three wins on the spin for Mellon’s men, who are back up to fifth and just four points off Wycombe at the top of the table. Jordan Clark is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring Shrewsbury's fifth goal on Tuesday night . Bad week for… COVENTRY. Coventry’s performances have plummeted this season along with their attendances. On their return to the Ricoh Arena in September the Sky Blues drew in a crowd of 27,306, beat Gillingham 1-0 and moved up to eighth place in League One. On Saturday, just 11,888 were in attendance as Steven Pressley’s side lost to unbeaten league leaders Bristol City, a result which was compounded by Tuesday night’s 4-1 thrashing at Oldham. Pressley's side are now just one point off the bottom of the table in 20th place. Talent scout: Michael Petrasso (Notts County) QPR have all but abandoned their academy in recent years as Tony Fernandes has ploughed tens of millions of pounds into signing players, but young Canadian winger Petrasso may be hard to ignore if his career continues on its upward trajectory. The 19-year-old, just 5ft 6in, scored twice as Notts County moved up to fifth place in League One with an impressive 3-2 win at Barnsley on Tuesday night.

"Furious Manchester City will write to UEFA to complain on behalf of their supporters after the governing body revealed they would not take action against CSKA Moscow for allowing fans in to their behind closed doors Champions League game on Tuesday. City were flabbergasted to see 300 rowdy Russian fans standing drinking beer — itself a breach of Champions League rules — in the main stand of the Khimki Arena in Moscow to watch their side snatch a 2-2 draw with a disputed late penalty. Hearing stories of media passes and sponsor tickets being sold to CSKA fans and suspicious that security staff may also have let fans through the gates, City asked UEFA to look in to the issue. Around 300 CSKA Moscow fans were in the main stand, despite the match being played behind closed doors . The CSKA fans watched their side come from behind to secure a point against Manchester City . UEFA had ordered the match to be played behind closed doors because of racist behaviour by CSKA fans . Official crowd - 0 . Club delegates - 75 per club . Centre circle boys and parents - 50 . Media - 150 . UEFA partners (sponsors) - 300 . On Wednesday though, UEFA declared themselves happy with the way things had been handled, prompting dismay and anger at City whose own travelling fans had been prevented by police from reaching an apartment overlooking the stadium from which they planned to watch the game. A City source said last night: ‘We feel this is wrong and a complete injustice. It’s unfair that in a game that is supposed to be played in an empty stadium, the home club have 300 fans singing and cheering them on and we don’t have any. To us, that’s not a punishment.’ But UEFA chief of press Pedro Pinto said: ‘I think the club has already been penalised a lot, less than three per cent of the stadium capacity was in attendance. The club isn’t getting gate receipts and the players aren’t getting any meaningful support. ‘If we say it’s behind closed doors, then it’s supposed to be behind closed doors to the general public, but there are always tickets given to VIPs, UEFA staff and sponsors. City threw away a two-goal lead as Seydou Doumbia and Natcho scored in the second half for the hosts . Natcho's late penalty made it 2-2 after City had looked comfortable after going two goals ahead in Moscow . James Milner scored City's second, sliding home to meet a cross from their first goalscorer Sergio Aguero . ‘Following Tuesday’s match between CSKA Moscow and Manchester City, UEFA has reviewed the officials’ reports and found no breach of the conditions related to a match played behind closed doors that make part of the disciplinary decision. ‘Only people who were allowed to enter the stadium (club delegations, media, security staff, UEFA and guests of sponsorship partners) attended the match with no record of inappropriate behaviour. ‘However, UEFA is reviewing the “behind closed doors” policy to see if alternative solutions could be implemented in the future.’ ‘Our sponsors and partners pay a lot of money to be associated with the competition and are entitled to receive a number of tickets. They shouldn’t have to pay the price for the behaviour of others.’ Pinto said UEFA’s reports from Moscow have shown there was no record of ‘any inappropriate behaviour in the stands’. He added: ‘We can’t stop a limited number of sponsors and corporate guests from supporting their own team. If they decide to show up with a scarf or flag we can’t stop that. ‘I can tell you, however, that there is an ongoing internal conversation on this issue in general and perhaps we’ll look to see if there are better solutions.’ Relations between City and CSKA are already at a low ebb following last season’s Champions League clash in Moscow that saw visiting midfielder Yaya Toure racially abused. Officials from the Russian club subsequently showed their contempt for City by turning up at an official reception ahead of the return game at the Etihad Stadium dressed in jeans. City are now furious at the latest events in Moscow and captain Vincent Kompany took a dim view of the matter. He said: ‘This one really annoys me and maybe it’s on top of other things as well.

Nov 5.....Man City 5-2 CSKA Moscow . Nov 27....Man City 4-2 Viktoria Plzen . Dec 10....B Munich 2-3 Man City . ‘You say “No fans” then all of a sudden you turn up and basically the only team that hasn’t got fans is Man City. So who’s getting punished? Who is being done for racism? Man City or Moscow? ‘I don’t have a problem, they’ll say it’s sponsors and so on and they need to give certain allocations, but why are we getting punished? ‘And again, because you’ll have people in your papers writing columns saying “he should be looking at his own performance and stuff” — so, done, we’ve analysed it and we know we should have done better. But things like this are unacceptable to honest, there’s just no fairness in it.’ City were leading 2-0 at half-time but only took a point in the end after a controversial late penalty gave CSKA their first point in Group E. ‘It doesn’t have an effect on the players,’ said Kompany. ‘It’s just little things when you leave with a result like this. ‘Obviously you can’t deny there’s a bit of frustration, and I’m not looking for an excuse, but if you want to play it fair then, fair enough, you’ve got to let your sponsors have some tickets but why the hell do we not have any fans here?

"Robbie Keane modestly shrugged off his goalscoring feats after establishing himself as the top marksman in European Championship qualifying history. The 34-year-old Republic of Ireland skipper helped himself to a hat-trick with a clinical display of finishing in Saturday evening's 7-0 demolition of Gibraltar to take his tally in European qualifiers to 21, one more than Turkey's Hakan Sukur. In the process, he increased his record career total for Ireland to 65, just three fewer than West Germany legend Gerd Muller and six behind Miroslav Klose, who recently announced his retirement from international football. VIDEO: Scroll down to see some audacious skill from Keane during a training session . Robbie Keane celebrates at Aviva Stadium as he completes his hat-trick against Gibraltar . But Keane, who famously rarely remembers details of the games in which he has played, later insisted personal milestones were not at the forefront of his mind. Asked if he was aware of the company he is keeping, he said: 'I get messages from people telling me - my brother tells me all the time. 'He texts me and my mates text me, but I genuinely couldn't tell you who's even close to me on it. That's being honest. I know Klose - that's as far as I know. 'Honestly, I don't really think about it. Like I said, I get messages from people, but personally I don't really think about it. 'I never think about what's happened before, I never think about what's going to happen in the future because I can't predict what's going to happen in the future. 'The past is the past. I scored those goals, but I'm so focused on what I'm doing now that I'm not really interested in anybody else, to be honest.' Keane leaves the pitch in Dublin with the match ball after his three-goal feat . Keane made his senior international debut as a 17-year-old against the Czech Republic in March 1998, and scored for the first time in a green shirt against Malta in the October of the same year. Former strike-partner Niall Quinn, whose then record of 21 goals he surpassed a decade ago to the day on Monday, knew from those early days that the Republic had a real talent on their hands, but the Los Angeles Galaxy hitman's record is little short of phenomenal. Keane, who has nevertheless attracted criticism for his performances at times in recent years, is the nation's most-capped player with his latest hat-trick marking a 136th appearance, and he has insisted he will keep on turning up for as long as he is wanted and feels able to contribute. Defender John O'Shea has little doubt how important the Dubliner remains to his country. O'Shea said: 'People will obviously crib because they are desperate to knock Robbie as soon as they can, but believe me he is an absolute legend, purely because of his goalscoring, his finishing. 'He still has to put those chances away, in the right place at the right time. He's a special, special player and still will be for years to come.' Ireland defender John O'Shea heaped praise on Ireland's record goalscorer Keane . In the short term, the focus for both men is a trip to Gelsenkirchen and Tuesday's Euro 2016 qualifier against World champions Germany, who slipped to a shock 2-0 defeat in Poland as Ireland were making merry against Gibraltar. Keane said: 'It's a tough game, completely different. Obviously the opposition it's going to be a tough test. 'Before this game [Gibraltar], our main aim was to get six points going into the Germany game and we've done that, so we're going into the Germany game with a lot of confidence. 'Make no mistake, we can go there and get something out of that game, there's no question about that.'","Keane is now top scorer in European Championship qualifying history .

"Manchester City’s Champions League hopes are clinging by a thread once again after a depressing and controversial night in Russia. Manuel Pellegrini’s team were 2-0 up and cruising at half-time in the Arena Khimki only to concede twice in the second half. City headed for home with much to complain about given the highly dubious nature of the penalty that levelled things up for CSKA with four minutes to go and the fact there appeared to be 300 home fans cheering from the main stand on a night when UEFA had decreed the game must be played behind closed doors.

UEFA were investigating that issue amid suggestions sponsors tickets had been sold on the black market to fans. City have complained to the governing body and UEFA officials were seen taking photos of the supporters – many clutching beer bottles – during the second half. Nevertheless, it is the nature of City’s second half collapse that will trouble Pellegrini even if Bayern Munich’s subsequent rout of Roma in Italy improved the Premier League club’s chances slightly in Group E. Pellegrini didn’t want to discuss the referee on Tuesday night but when asked if the rogue CSKA fans could have influenced his penalty decision, the City manager said: 'Well I agree but maybe it’s not my duty to talk about things that don’t correspond with my duty. 'UEFA have their rule, they were aware the game was behind closed doors. 'I don’t know who allows or gives permission to give entrance to those people but it’s not my duty.

Leading through goals from Sergio Aguero and James Milner at half-time, Pellegrini suggested his players lost their focus and appeared to suggest they were affected by the extreme cold in Moscow. 'We didn’t play well in the second half,' he said. 'Maybe there was an excess of trust [confidence] or it was so cold that it was very difficult for the players to continue to have motivation for the whole game.'

"Considering there is a ban on fans in the Arena Khimki, there were plenty of bodies in the stadium for Tuesday night’s match. Around 650 people were inside the ground - club officials, sponsors and media - as well as a gathering of fans outside the stadium endeavouring to make themselves heard. In fact, songs went back and forth between the fans and the sponsors, who were enthusiastic enough to suggest they weren’t entirely impartial viewers. 650 people watched CSKA Moscow vs Manchester City due to the Russian club's stadium ban . Didi Hamann is not afraid to express his opinion, and the former City midfielder voiced his concerns over Manuel Pellegrini’s team selection during the first half. ‘I wonder how long Pellegrini can justify playing Toure,’ Hamann tweeted, only for the Ivorian to run the game with a pass completion rate of 96 per cent. City boss Manuel Pellegrini was criticised by Didi Hamaan over his team selection on Tuesday night . The temperature at the Khimki was below freezing on Tuesday night - Aleksandar Kolarov, Vincent Kompany, James Milner and Pablo Zabaleta were the only City players not wearing gloves - but not as cold as relations between the two clubs after racist chanting directed at Yaya Toure during City’s last visit to Moscow. It was interesting, therefore, that City’s chief executive and chairman didn’t make the trip to Russia this time.

"Tyson Fury put tape over his mouth to ensure that he gave the first silent press conference in the loud mouthed history of boxing. So determined was the giant 26-year-old not to cause further of fence in the build-up to his heavwyeight battle of Britain with Dereck Chisora that he uttered not one word as the two came face to face in London. Fury has been fined £15,000 by the British Boxing Board of Control for the four-letter outburst at their previous head-to-head confrontation. Tyson Fury taped up his mouth and wouldn't speak to the press ahead of his fight with Dereck Chisora . The boxer let his uncle and trainer Peter Fury talk on his behalf during the press conference . Peter Fury, his uncle and trainer, did have something to say: 'The Board wanted us to tone it down a bit so here's Tyson... the Board dummy.' Fury was prepared to respond to questions with gestures and indicated that he will knockout Chisora in one or two rounds at the ExCeL arena in London's Docklands on November 29. That is the rescheduled date for a world title eliminator which was postponed when Chisora cracked his hand in sparring. Fury, who had the initial letters BBBC written on his mouth tape, stripped off his shirt to reveal a torso well-honed with the fight still two months away. When asked if he would maintain his vow of silence throughout those eight weeks he nodded in the affirmative. Muhammad Ali – not only the greatest but the most voluble of all boxers - famously taped over his mouth after being pilloried for speaking too much. He ripped away the gag after a few minutes, unable to contain himself any longer. Muhammad Ali once taped his mouth shut but only kept up the appearance for a matter of minutes . Fury promised to maintain his silence until the fight but was happy to use gestures to show his feelings . Dereck Chisora will take on Fury in six weeks and promised to knock the silent fighter out . Promoter Mick Hennessy made it clear how seriously the Board viewed Fury's previous rant when he said: 'This fight could be in jeopardy. If anything else happened, we could be looking at a year's ban.' Frank Warren, the lead promoter, made his own apology for the outrageous uproar which went before when he said: 'I should have controlled that press conference better. I hold my hands up. I share some of the blame for what went on. Fortunately there was nothing physical.' Peter Fury and Hennessy revealed that they were upset at being excluded from the Board of Control hearing. Promoter Frank Warren apologised for the issues at their previous meeting saying he could have controlled it . Fury was fined £15,000 for his four-letter outburst when the pair last came face to face this year . Hennessy said: 'We need characters in boxing. Sometimes Tyson is the gentleman but on other occasions he gets rubbed up the wrong way and he should be allowed to express himself.' The irony, of course, is that this impersonation of Marcel Marceau will generate as much publicity as his wild misconduct has done hitherto. Chisora was in a mellow mood but when it was drawn to his attention that Fury was indicating with his fingers a first or second round stoppage, he said simply: 'I will knock him out.' Boxing now holds its breath, waiting to see if Tyson will be able to hold his peace until the end of November. Fury and Chisora were sharing a stage together for the first time since their fight was postponed this summer . Tyson Fury v Dereck Chisora will be live on BoxNation on Saturday 29 November.","Tyson Fury was fined £15,000 after four-letter outburst at last head-to-head .

"A Georgia couple faces murder charges after being accused of savagely beating their toddler to death. Two-year-old Aiden Calvo’s battered body was covered in bruises, blood was splattered on his bedroom wall, he had broken bones – parents Elizabeth Calvo, 21, and Adam Garber, 25, were arrested while the baby was taken to the hospital Dec 16. The extent of the boy’s injuries has upset even the most grizzled of police veterans. Now in jail: Elizabth Calvo (left) and Adam Garber (right) have both been charged with murder . ‘Amongst law enforcement, these are the type of cases that really get under your skin,’Gwinnett Police Cpl. Jake Smith told WSB. Police were called to the evil couple’s suburban Atlanta apartment while he was having seizures and coughing up blood, according to a police report cited by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. What they found inside the house of horrors shocked them. The staggering severity of the abuse suffered by the helpless baby was not discovered until he arrived at the hospital. He had bruises on his back, forehead and genitals, a hand print on his buttocks, bite marks on multiple fingers, bleeding in his nose and stomach, a fractured skull, diaper rash so severe it caused the skin to breakdown and bleeding on the brain from a traumatic brain injury. The baby's blood was splattered on the walls. Mr Garber attempted to explain the grisly scene by saying he had diaper rash and bruised easily, cops said. Tortured toddler: Aiden Calvo, only two-years-old, was beaten to death by his parents, cops said . House of horrors: The Couple shared by the demented couple and where the baby's blood was found splattered on the walls . The suffering baby is believed to have died from the head wound, Mr Smith told WSB. The pair initially faced child cruelty charges, but those were upgraded once the tortured toddler succumbed to his injuries only three days before Christmas. Ms Calvo and Mr Garber both turned on each other under questioning from investigators, blaming the other for the abuse – authorities did not buy it. ‘The detectives have evidence to suggest that both participated and certainly both participated in the neglect,’ Mr Smith told WSB. Multiple reports claim the pair told investigators they had moved from New York only days before making the 911 call. The demented duo now sits in Gwinnett County Detention Center without bond and are due to appear in court Tuesday morning.","Elizabeth Calvo, 21, and Adam Garber, 25, have both been charged with murder in the death of toddler Aiden Calvo .

"Such was the ease with which Anthony Joshua broke down Denis Bakhtov in exactly four minutes on Saturday night that he immediately returned to his dressing room to hit the pads with his trainer for half an hour. ‘I was scheduled for 10 rounds and it only went two, so it was back to work to make up the rest,’ he said. That warm-down was just five minutes shorter than the time the heavyweight has spent in the ring since making his professional debut at the same O2 Arena 12 months and nine fights ago. Anthony Joshua fired out a warning to his rivals with the crushing defeat of veteran Kazakh Denis Bakhtov . Joshua's warm-down lasted just five minutes less than the Watford-born fighter spent in the ring . He displayed a hitherto unseen menace as he licked his lips, grinned, and brutally dismantled the Kazakh veteran of 47 fights. Bakhtov had not been stopped in almost a decade and was expected to give Joshua the rounds he craves, but proved to be just another punch bag. ‘It ended a bit early,’ lamented Joshua. ‘I wanted to learn and practise some stuff. Even when I was an amateur, I had a desire to hurt opponents. When I’m sparring, I get that same vision I had against Bakhtov, I want to get you, I want to hurt you. I’ll never forget where I came from and that gives me that desire. These guys are in there to take what I’ve been working towards for seven years. ‘They (his fights) get stopped pretty early. I wanted him on the floor, out cold. Joshua batters Bakhtov as the Brit racks up his ninth win in his ninth professional fight . ‘I don’t like it when the referees step in and stop the fight. That’s why I end up hitting them because they get in the way! ‘It’s fun. If he had me up against the ropes, punching my head, he would love it but it’s the other way round.’ Joshua picked up the WBC International title, little more than a piece of expensive bling, which will head straight into storage. But the lasting impression will linger long in the heavyweight division. ‘I need to put this behind me,’ was Joshua’s oft-repeated mantra as the 24-year-old attempts to keep his feet on the ground while others predict both fame and fortune. ‘Not everyone will get knocked out like that, not everyone will fold under pressure. There’s a whole ocean of heavyweights out there,’ he added. ‘There’s been a long line of heavyweights and there’s always two or three that rise to the top. I’ve got the potential but I’ve got to graft and grind to bring that dream to a reality.’ And after a low-key 25th birthday on Wednesday, Joshua must turn his attention to six weeks hence when he faces Michael Sprott in Liverpool. Bakhtov looks to hit back but he was overwhelmed in a fight which was stopped in the second round . Joshua celebrates victory in the ring with his team of trainers and promoter Eddie Hearn (right) The 39-year-old from Reading had won five consecutive, if underwhelming, fights before he was knocked out in the first round by an unheralded Kiwi in June. Promoter Eddie Hearn was barely half-joking when he said he could imagine Sprott having a change of heart or at the very least demanding a larger cheque. While Joshua insists he remains ‘the contender’, Hearn has long predicted a British title fight at Watford’s Vicarage Road next summer, just three miles from the Meriden Estate where Joshua grew up. Beyond that the likes of David Price, Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora will follow his every move. The man himself would go as far only to say that he hoped to be at the top of the domestic pile by the end of his second year. As for his first, the Olympic champion refused to rate himself higher than one out of 10. ‘I’ve got years to go,’ he added. ‘Let me do the same thing to Wladimir Klitschko then I’ll give myself a 10. That was Denis Bakhtov not Klitschko, he’s not a world champion.’","Anthony Joshua stopped Denis Bakhtov in the second round in London .

"Ordinarily a pancake is a pretty simple creation, consisting of just flour, egg, milk and some butter. But for one father, the humble breakfast snack is a major work or art. For the past year, Brek Nebel has created the most amazing artwork each morning on his frying pan. Mr Nebel, from Marysville, Washington, said he is inspired by films such as Despicable Me and Frozen. Brek Nebel began his pancake odyssey by creating an ingenious design featuring Disney's Mickey Mouse . Mr Nebel began working on his creations 12 months ago to inspire his young son Koen, three . Little Koen, three, even helps his father create the artworks assisting him with the choice of colour or design . The 31-year-old started creating his artworks for his young son Koen, 3, who loves pancakes. As well as eating them, Koen helps his father mix the batter and pick the colours to be used. The pair have been creating their pancake art for a year - making a different character each week. It began when Mr Nebel carved a Mickey Mouse head from three basic round pancakes. Mr Nebel said once his son decides on a design or a colour he disappears until it's time to eat . However, Koen Nebel, three, also enjoys using any remaining batter to create his own pancakes . One of Koen Nebel's favourite pancakes is this one featuring a bright red fire engine . But soon blossomed into a weekly trend using cookie cutters, moulds and coloured batter to design the likes of dinosaurs and sharks. In a bid to expand the boundaries of pancake art, Mr Nebel has even created a design that works with 3D glasses. He said: 'Koen enjoys them because he helps with most of the process. Mr Nebel corresponds with some of his online fans who like to swap tips for making the perfect pancakes . Some of the designs have been made for the benefit of people with three dimensional glasses . The complicated designs feature a range of animals, science fiction creatures and even vehicles . 'He pours the ingredients in the bowl, mixes the batter, separates cocoa and colouring and even picks the colours a lot of the time. 'While I'm doing the outline he wanders off, but checks in, and then he's back on the counter to use the leftover batter to put his own pancakes on the griddle. 'His favourite part is tearing them apart, right before he eats them.' Over the past year Mr Nebel has created dozens of different designs which he later photographed . As he gained experience working with pancakes the complexity of his designs increased dramatically .

"How do you stop your biscuit breaking and mixing with your tea when you dunk it in your drink? Thanks to a new product that's a conundrum that might never trouble tea drinkers again. A cylindrical mesh pouch has gone on sale that dips into your cup and catches any stray biscuit, letting you enjoy your drink in peace even after subjecting it to a gruelling dunking session. Scroll down for video . A Watford-based entrepreneur has designed a teabag that catches crumbs. The £2 ($3.25) Cookie Catcher (shown) is a meshed pouch that is lowered into a beverage. When a biscuit is dunked inside it the bag catches any breakages. Using a string the drinker can then get the bag and the crumbs out of the tea . The device was designed by dad of two Andrew Tinsley from Watford, Hertfordshire. solved the age-old problem with a canny mesh pouch which is immersed inside a mug of tea. The drinker dips their biscuits in the mug like normal but the pouch collects any unwanted bits that might float off during the dunking process. And even if the biscuit becomes too soggy and breaks off altogether the  gadget will guarantee drinkers are not left with a heap of biscuity sludge at the bottom of their cup. Dunkers know that insufficient biscuit submersion results in an unsatisfying experience; waiting too long causes the biscuit to break apart, leaving an unpleasant sludge in the bottom of the mug. But research, conducted by Dr Stuart Farrimond, suggests there is a science behind the dunk, with the humble Rich Tea biscuit named most robust biscuit for dunking. In addition vertical submersion is best, and the fat content of the biscuit and the temperature of the liquid are crucial in the success of your dunking ventures. The length of time a biscuit can be dunked is roughly proportional to the amount of fat and sugar in a biscuit. The sweeter and more buttery a biscuit, the faster it will break apart when dunking. Once the drinker has finished dunking they can lift the washable pouch out using an attached string and continue drinking the tea as normal. Mr Tinsley apparently dreamed up the design after watching family members dunking their biscuits for too long. He now hopes his product, called the Cookie Catcher, will become a staple in homes around Britain. The products are made of so nylon they can be washed out and re-used. Despite only launching the product two weeks ago Mr Tinsley has already sold more than 600 Cookie Catchers, which cost £2 ($3.25). 'The idea came to me when after a big lunch my family were all sat around drinking tea and tucking into a selection box of biscuits,' said Mr Tinsley. 'My brother had drunk a bit much at lunch and kept over-dunking his biscuits in his tea. Every time he left them in the tea too long and they would break off.

I've always been entrepreneurial so I took the idea away and came up with this little mesh sack that sits inside your tea cup and catches all the bits. 'When you're done dunking you whip it out of the mug using the attached string and you can enjoy the rest of your tea with no bits in. He adds that it can also be washed out and used over and over again as it is made from nylon. 'Anyone who has ever dunked a biscuit in tea will understand what this product is all about,' he continued. 'It's a British solution to a very British problem. 'We have only just launched and we've already sold about 600 Cookie Catchers, so they're obviously striking a chord with the tea drinkers of Britain.'

"The days of awkwardly cutting an oval egg into odd-shaped slices to make it fit into a sandwich is now over. A kitchen gadget has been invented that squashes the egg into a square, meaning it can be chopped more easily and placed into sandwiches, burgers and onto salads. The simple device simply squashes the egg, with the help of a small drop of oil, to change it from an oval into a cube. Scroll down for video . A clever gadget has been invented to solve the age-old problem of fitting slices of round egg in a square sandwich. For generations people have been chopping up circular pieces of egg and layering them on bread but being forced to leave gaps at the corners. But this device turns the oval snack into a cube (shown) A Chicago-based entreprenuer has come up with something else worth getting egg-cited about after inventing a gadget that scrambles an egg inside its own shell. The £10 ($17) contraption named Goose gently spins the egg, blending the yolk and the white without cracking the shell itself. The already-scrambled egg can then be soft or hard boiled - and its creator, Geraint Krumpe, claims the ingenious method makes them taste far better than regular eggs. The contraption, known as the Egg-Q-ber, is a jar in which hard-boiled eggs are placed and squashed into the new shape. A user simply has to cook their egg, peel off the shell, place it in the container and screw on the lid, which forces it into a cube. After one minute the egg will have moulded to a cube shape and can be chopped up ready to eat. The square slices can then fit to the exact shape of a sandwich. The £4.99 ($8.50) gadget is 3.5 inches by 2.5 inches (8.9cm by 11.4cm) in size and is made by Kidult. Robert Lawson, 33, is from Harrogate, Yorkshire and is the owner of Kidult, who manufacture the Egg-Q-Ber. The contraption, known as the Egg-Q-Ber, is a jar in which hard-boiled eggs are placed and squashed into the new shape. A user simply has to cook their egg, peel off the shell, place it in the container with a dash of oil, and screw on the lid to get the sandwich-friendly square eggs (shown) He said: 'The concept was conceived in Japan by a man named Masashi Nakagawa and his agent then approached Kidult. 'We . then designed, sourced, manufactured and distributed it. The Egg-Q-Ber . is something that started as a novelty but it's also practical and . people enjoy using it. 'It stops the egg rolling around on the plate and it makes the correct shapes for sandwiches.' Ben . Redhead, head of buying for Firebox who is stocking the product, added: . 'Boiled eggs have been the bane of picnics and packed lunches the world . over due to their completely illogical shape. To use the Egg Q-ber device the egg must first be hard boiled (left) before being placed inside with a bit of oil and closing the lid (right) The egg must be kept inside with the lid closed (left) for one minute. When it is taken out it will have been moulded into a cube shape . 'Now we’ve discovered the Egg-Q-Ber, we’ve finally brought a little discipline to the dinner plate and can create perfectly uniform sandwich coverage too. 'All someone needs to do is hard boil their egg and peel off the shell, pop it in the Egg-Q-Ber, wait for a minute and it will be in a cube shape. 'The product proves very popular in the summer months when people tend to eat more salads and sandwiches. 'People have said they were sceptical at first but found the results were actually really good, and that their friends are all wanting them now.'","A gadget that can squash eggs into cubes has been unveiled .

"For a man with so much going on in his head, Wilfried Bony has done a fair job of relocating his feet. It’s barely been three weeks since the Ivorian with 25 goals to his name last season was facing questions of his failure to score even one in this campaign. Sigurdsson has had a hand in eight goals (seven assists, one goal) in nine PL games for Swansea this season. Those have been sufficiently addressed, with four strikes in three games, including the two on Saturday that saw off Leicester and made his position in forthcoming contract talks a touch stronger. Those discussions are expected to commence imminently, with Bony (right) happy to extend his commitment beyond the summer of 2017, though he has made no secret of his ambitions to join a bigger club. Wilfried Bony has been in fine form for Swansea after scoring four goals in three games . Bony and Sigurdsson combined for both goals which saw Swansea beat Leicester 2-0 . The Ivorian scored 25 goals for Swansea last campaign and has answered his critics in the last three weeks . SWANSEA (4-2-3-1): Fabianski 6; Rangel 7, Fernandez 6, Williams 7, Taylor 6; Ki 6, Shelvey 6.5; Routledge 6 (Dyer 83min), Sigurdsson 7.5 (Carroll 58, 6), Montero 7; Bony 8 (Gomis 83).

Subs not used: Smith, Schlupp, Wasilewski, Wood. Referee: Mike Jones 7. Man of the match: Wilfried Bony. Approaches never came in the summer despite interest from Liverpool and Tottenham, but that will surely change if the 25-year-old matches last season’s goal tally, which is his target. ‘I knew the goals would come,’ said Bony, who celebrated his strikes against Leicester with a T-shirt tribute to two friends who died recently. ‘When I wasn’t scoring the team was doing well. Now, the team needs me to score and I did. I have a target in my head and I will take it step by step.’ Of his contract situation, Bony added: ‘Contract talks I leave to my agent. But I am happy.’ Garry Monk, meanwhile, does not expect to be charged by the FA after he said Stoke’s Victor Moses cheated. He said: ‘I’ve been in contact with the FA. I’ve made my views, I’m happy with them and I can’t see anything happening after that.’ Leicester boss Nigel Pearson has seen his side go four games without a win since the 5-3 victory over Manchester United. He said: ‘The problem is people want to talk about that (the United game) all the time. But as soon as that game is over it is not important.’","Swansea's Wilfried Bony has scored four goals in three games .

"The Pentagon has refused to get involved in a row brewing at Fort Bragg, North Carolina where the on-base spouses club has refused membership to the lesbian spouse of a female Army lieutenant, a Department of Defense spokesman said Wednesday. Last month Ashley Broadway, the newlywed wife of Lt. Col. Heather Mack, was blocked from joining the club at Fort Bragg. She was told she couldn’t be admitted because she lacked a military spouse ID card, a rule only enacted after she asked to join. The move sparked accusations that Broadway was being prevented from joining simply because she is a lesbian. Modern family: Ashley Broadway, right, the same-sex wife of Lt Colonel Heather Mack, left, has been denied membership of Fort Bragg's military spouses' club . Speaking out after the Pentagon’s decision not to get overrule the club, Broadway said she was extremely disappointed by the disregard of both officials at Fort Bragg and at the Department of the Army to the continued discrimination against gays and lesbians despite the repeal of 'Don’t Ask Don’t Tell' in 2011. ‘This is no longer about me joining this officers club. This is about the Pentagon and the Department of Defense and the Department of Army telling the country that it is OK to discriminate against gay and lesbian service members and their families,’ she told NBC News. ‘This is not the end. I’m not going to drop this. I’m not going to sit back and take the discrimination when I know good and well the Pentagon and Secretary of Defense can sign rights today that would also authorize military IDs and extend housing (to the same-sex spouses of service members),’ she said. Happy family: The couple have been together 15 years, they share a two-year-old boy and have another baby on the way . The legal basis for the Pentagon’s stance is a department-wide ‘instruction’ drafted in 2008. It ensures that ‘non-federal entities’ operating on U.S. military installations don’t discriminate on the basis of ‘race, color, creed, sex, age, disability, or national origin,’ but makes no mention of discrimination based on sexual orientation. ‘The Officer Spouses' Club at Ft. Bragg is in compliance with the DOD instruction,’ said Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the Pentagon. ‘When you look at the instruction there are a few things it has to meet. As long as they meet those criteria, they’re allowed to meet on the base.’ The Army’s handling of that matter runs counter to a directive issued Jan. 9 by Marine Corps leaders who ordered that same-sex spouses be allowed to participate in spouses clubs at all Marine bases. However the Pentagon's position on the Fort Bragg matter is legally viable because the Department of Defense still follows the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage as the legal union of one man and one woman. Broadway married her partner of 15 years, Lt Colonel Heather Mack, in November after the repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy banning openly gay service members from the military. The newlyweds have a two-year-old son, and Mack is now eight months pregnant with the couple's second child. 'After ""Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,"" I thought, wow, I can finally be part of something, finally give back to the military community in ways other than just writing a check. So it was a blow. A real blow. Here, I thought things were progressing. I was knocked back down,' said Broadway. Unofficial club: The Association of Bragg Officers' Spouses is located in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, but it is not directly affiliated with the Department of Defense . In an open letter to the spouses group in December, Broadway wrote about her commitment to the military, saying that she has been to every one of her wife’s promotion ceremonies and endured every deployment. In the letter, Broadway said that she has been a valuable member of the military community, tutoring Army children in reading and volunteering her time with Humane Societies assisting soldiers in finding homes for their pets while they serve overseas – activities that make her an ideal candidate for membership in the club. The Association of Bragg Officers' Spouses is a non-profit organization, which means that it is not directly affiliated with the Department of Defense. Maxwell suggested that the club's status gives it legal leeway to discriminate against applicants like Broadway. ‘They are part of and affiliated, by definition, with Fort Bragg. They need to understand the Army and the military’s directive on this by the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell.” They need to step in line with that,’ she said. Maxwell has accused club president Mary King of imposing her personal homophobic beliefs on the organization and called on her to step down.","Ashley Broadway, the wife of Lt. Col.

It is also the first time this specific type of geological activity has been observed in the solar system other than on our planet. Scientists have found evidence of plate tectonics on Jupiter's moon Europa (pictured)  – the first sign of this geologic activity on a solar system world other than Earth, raising hopes that life could one day be found there . Less than a year ago, scientists discovered plumes of water vapour erupting from Jupiter's moon’s south polar region, so it may be possible for a robotic probe to sample Europa’s liquid water at a distance without landing on it. The latest find appears to solve a puzzle that has perplexed planetary scientists for years. Until now, researchers have had visual evidence of Europa’s icy crust expanding, but they could never find areas where the old crust was being destroyed to make room for the new. Examining images of the moon taken by Nasa’s Galileo orbiter in the early 2000s, planetary geologists Simon Kattenhorn of the University of Idaho and Louise Prockter of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland, discovered some unusual geological boundaries. The surface of Europa is slightly smaller than the Earth’s moon and is riddled with cracks and ridges. Blocks on the surface are known to have shifted in the same way blocks on either side of the San Andreas Fault move past each other on Earth. The surface of Europa is slightly smaller than the Earth’s moon and is riddled with cracks and ridges. Blocks on the surface are known to have shifted in the same way blocks on either side of the San Andreas Fault move past each other on Earth . Europa is the sixth closest moon to Jupiter and the smallest of the four Galilean satellites that belong to the planet. It was discovered by Galileo Galilei in January 1610 and is named after a Phoenician noblewoman in Greek mythology who was courted by Zeus and became the Queen of Crete. Europa orbits Jupiter in around three-and-a-half days with an orbital radius of 670,900km. It is slightly smaller than the Earth's moon, but at 3,100km in diameter it is the sixth largest moon and 15th largest object in the entire solar system. It is likely to have an outer layer of water, some 100km thick. The outer layer of the water is believed to be frozen with a liquid ocean underneath. The moon has plate tectonics like on Earth. It is one of the smoothest objects in the solar system with few craters on its surface, which is tectonically active and relatively young. Many parts of Europa’s surface show evidence of extension, where wide bands - up to tens of miles wide - formed as the surface ripped apart, and fresh icy material from the underlying shell moved into the newly created gap, a process akin to terrestrial seafloor spreading, according to the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience. ‘We have been puzzled for years as to how all this new terrain could be formed, but we couldn’t figure out how it was accommodated. We finally think we’ve found the answer,’ Dr Prockter said. Scientists studying Europa often reconstruct the moon’s blocks into their original configuration to get a picture of what the surface looked like before disruption occurred. It was when they were rearranging the terrain that the two experts discovered that more than 12,000 square miles (nearly 20,000 square km) of the surface in the moon’s high northern latitudes was missing. Further evidence suggested that the missing terrain had moved under a second surface plate - a scenario commonly seen on Earth at plate-tectonic boundaries. The two scientists said that ice volcanoes on the overriding plate possibly formed through melting and absorption of the slab as it moved below the surface, while a lack of mountains at the subduction zone, implies that material was pushed into the interior rather than crumpled up as the two plates mashed against each other. The surface of Europa is slightly smaller than the Earth's moon and is riddled with cracks and ridges. Blocks on the surface are known to have shifted in the same way blocks on either side of the San Andreas Fault (pictured in San Luis Obispo in California) move past each other on Earth . Less than a year ago, scientists discovered plumes of water vapour erupting from the moon’s south polar region (illustrated), so it may be possible for a robotic probe to sample Europa’s liquid water at a distance without landing on it . They believe the subducted slab has been absorbed into Europa's ice shell – which may be up to 20 miles (about 30 kilometers) thick - rather than diving through it into the moon’s underlying ocean. Europa’s surface is considered to be relatively young at between 40 and 90 millions of years old, which can perhaps now be explained by plate tectonics as older material was destroyed. Scientists have previously seen evidence of material moving up from under the shell, but until now, no mechanism had been found for moving material back into the shell, and possibly into the large ocean below the ice. ‘Europa may be more Earthlike than we imagined if it has a global plate tectonic system,’ Dr Kattenhorn said. He told Space.com: ‘Earth may not be alone. There may be another body out there that has plate tectonics. And not only that, it's ice!’ There have been various proposals to explore Europa over the years, such as the Cryobot (pictured) which would be taken underground by a larger drill before it was then released into the ocean, searching for signs of past or present alien life . ‘Not only does this discovery make it one of the most geologically interesting bodies in the solar system, it also implies two-way communication between the exterior and interior – a way to move material from the surface into the subsurface – a process which has significant implications for Europa’s potential as a habitable world.’ Some scientists said that plate tectonics were essential to how life evolved on Earth. The theory goes that tectonics replenished nutrients and helped to stabilise the Earth’s climate. Jupiter's moon’s shell is thought to be 12 to 19 miles (20 to 30 kilometres) thick to subducting plates probably plunge a mile below the surface, so it is unlikely that nutrients from the surface are carried down to the ocean quickly. But Dr Kattenhorn said that this could possibly happen over time. Nasa has set aside £14.6 million ($25 million) to design probes that could reveal whether Europa is habitable. In July, the agency asked scientists to come forward with potential experiments for a Europa probe that could be launched in the 2020s and arrive at the icy satellite within three years of take-off. It said that next year, about 20 proposals will be chosen to receive shares of the £14.6 million ($25 million) for further study. The mission is designed to characterise the extent of Europa's ocean and its relation to the deeper interior. It will also look at the ice shell and determine global surface, compositions and chemistry, especially related to whether life could survive in that environment. Previous scientific findings point to the existence of a liquid water ocean located under the moon's icy crust. This ocean covers Europa entirely and contains more liquid water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Although Europa and Jupiter's other moons have been visited by other spacecraft, they were each limited to a single distant flyby of these satellites. Nasa’s Galileo spacecraft, launched in 1989 by the space shuttle, was the only mission to make repeated visits to Europa, passing close by the moon fewer than a dozen times. In December 2013, Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope observed water vapour above the moon's frigid south polar region. This provided the first strong evidence of water plumes erupting off the moon's surface, and a spacecraft could even be designed to fly through the plumes to make measurements of the composition of the underground ocean.","Scientists have found the first sign of this geologic activity on a solar system world other than Earth a year after discovering jets of water on Europa .

"Swansea midfielder Ki Sung-yueng wants to move a step closer to a Capital One Cup final hat-trick - and make big headlines back home in South Korea by beating Liverpool on Tuesday night. Ki has played in the last two League Cup finals, on a winning side for Swansea in 2013 and for a losing Sunderland team while on loan at the Stadium of Light last season, and would love to make it three in a row this term. Liverpool stand in his way in the last 16 at Anfield but Ki was part of the Swansea side which won 3-1 on Merseyside two seasons ago en route to claiming the first major trophy in the club's history. Swansea midfielder Ki Sung-yueng wants to move closer to a Capital One Cup final hat-trick at Wembley . Ki played in the last two League Cup finals,  winning in 2013 with Swansea and losing with Sunderland last year . 'It was fabulous there two years ago, it was the same time of the competition in October so we are definitely looking forward to playing one of the big teams in England,' Ki said. 'I'd love to go to Wembley three years in a row if I can. 'It's going to be tough because they have some quality players but I just want to enjoy this competition and with the players here I think we have a chance.' The 25-year-old is one of the poster boys of South Korean football having made the move to the Barclays Premier League and helping his country to the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil. And he knows that another Swansea triumph at Anfield would send shock waves right across the globe to his football-mad homeland. Ki losing out to Manchester City's Yaya Toure as Sunderland were defeated at Wembley in the final last year . 'There are more Liverpool supporters than Swansea back home in Korea as they are one of the biggest teams in England,' Ki said. 'If we win against Liverpool it's going to be big news, so we have nothing to lose and do our best. Click here for Saturday's match report . 'I think we have to put everything on this game and then we have a big chance to win. 'We don't want to waste this one because if we win we are in the quarter-final. 'If we win the cup our reputation is going up so the managers and the players are taking this competition seriously.' Swansea manager Garry Monk played a strong side when the blue half of Merseyside were swept aside in the last round in September, Roberto Martinez's Everton beaten 3-0 at the Liberty Stadium. And Monk is set to do the same again as he comes up against another one of his former Swansea managers in the shape of Brendan Rodgers. Swansea City manager Garry Monk guided Swansea to a 2-0 win against Leicester City on Saturday . Wayne Routledge and Gylfi Sigurdsson, who limped off in the second half of the league win over Leicester on Saturday evening with an ankle injury, could be rested alongside goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. But Monk will resist the idea of mass rotation and that means centre-back Ashley Williams could play at Anfield, although the Swansea skipper admits he will not be swapping shirts with Mario Balotelli at half-time if he comes up against the Italian. The Liverpool striker sparked controversy during Liverpool's Champions League tie with Real Madrid last week when he swapped shirts with Portuguese defender Pepe as the pair were leaving the pitch at the interval. 'If you see me swapping shirts at half-time I think you can give me a slap,' Williams said. 'Everyone's got an opinion on Balotelli. I think he's a good player and he's been difficult to play against every time I've come up against him. 'He hasn't found his feet at Liverpool yet but I'm sure it's only a matter of time because he's a top-quality player.'

"A Jack Russell faces being put to sleep after its tongue was ripped out by a hawk. Four-year-old Ollie was enjoying a walk with owner Ian Farquhar when the Harris hawk - which was being trained nearby - swooped and attacked him. The crazed bird of prey sank its talons into the dog before ripping off his tongue leaving the pooch 'screaming and covered in blood'. Poorly pooch: Four-year-old Ollie was enjoying a walk with owner Ian Farquhar when a Harris hawk swooped and attacked him . Mr Farquhar, 47, from Dundee, now faces . the heartbreaking decision of whether to have Ollie put to sleep after . being told by vets that he will have to be hand-fed for the rest of his . life. Mr Farquhar, a gardener, said: 'We were enjoying a nice walk on a lovely morning, Ollie was by my side and my other dog Rocky, was about 10 yards ahead of us. 'It all happened quite fast. I heard a scuffle and looked down and there was something big and brown attacking Ollie. 'I thought it was another dog at first, like a Staffordshire Bull Terrier and tried to kick it but it wouldn’t let go. Terrible decision: Mr Farquhar, 47, now faces the heartbreaking decision of whether to have Ollie put to sleep after being told by vets that he will have to be hand-fed for the rest of his life . 'Then I saw the wings and realised it . was a bird of prey. Ollie was howling and he was covered in blood. I . started crying and my clothes and my hands were covered in blood. 'I’m absolutely devastated.' Mr Farquhar said his sadness soon turned to anger when he realised the hawk was not wild but being trained by a man further up the path. He said: 'The hawk’s owner ran over and got the bird off Ollie, his tongue was in his hand. 'He had a go at me for kicking the bird. I couldn’t believe it. The path is popular with dog owners, he shouldn’t have been there. 'The owner said he would pay for the vets bills, but its not about the money, it’s about Ollie. If another dog had attacked Ollie, it would be almost certainly put down. So I want the hawk destroyed in case it attacks some other innocent animal.' Crazed: Mr Farquhar said his sadness soon turned to anger when he realised the Harris hawk was not wild but being trained by a man further up the path (file picture) Mr Farquhar and Ollie were taken to . Parkside Veterinary Practice in Dundee by the bird’s owner, Colin Kirk. Ollie has been in the care of vets since the attack on Friday morning. But unless Ollie learns to swallow his food without the use of his tongue, he will have to be hand fed meaning his quality of life will be poor. Mr Farquhar said: 'The vets have basically said he will never be the same again. He had to have a lump in his mouth sewed down and half of his tonsils were taken out. 'His quality of life is going to be low, but we’ll just have to see how he gets on. He might not even be able to drink on his own so I might have to bottle feed him. 'The attack has destroyed my life, Ollie’s and Rocky’s. The two dogs were best of friends and you can tell Rocky is missing him.' Dundee council worker Colin Kirk said the attack was an ‘unfortunate accident’ and said that he would respect any request to have the one-year-old hawk put down. 'I let her loose and she left her perch in a tree and flew over to his direction. She went on to the dog and I managed to get her off and separated them. 'It was quite a nasty injury, this chap was understandably jumping up and down. I explained that the bird was insured and he didn’t have to worry, and that the vet care will be dealt with. 'She has never attacked a dog or anyone I have been out with before. Maybe she caught a flash in the long grass and thought it was a rabbit.'

"A quick jog here, a shoving match there. Throw in a laundry basket, a concealed headset and talk of telescopes and you understand why Jose Mourinho is touchline box office. On Sunday, at Old Trafford, his latest stunt was to enter Manchester United’s dugout for a chat. Here, Sportsmail offers Mourinho a little advice on touchline etiquette… . Do stay until the end of the game… . For a man of untold wealth, you previously justified your habit of leaving early by saying you wanted to phone your wife with the score. No internet connection at home? No Sky subscription? One of these days it will get you in trouble, Jose. Surely the angry eyes above Roy Keane’s beard told you that much a few weeks back. Wait an extra couple of minutes or send your wife a text. Jose Mourinho (second right) angered Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert (centre) when he tried to shake his hand before the end of their Premier League encounter at Stamford Bridge in September . Don’t climb into other managers' dugouts… . Everyone knows that the Manchester United managerial situation might once have be a bit of a sore point. ‘Should have been me’, and all that. But climbing into the dugout after the game on Sunday? Even if it was to see your old mate Louis, it’s a bit much. Mourinho (left) climbed into the Manchester United dugout to exchange pleasantries with Louis van Gaal . Don't think outside the box… . Rightly or wrongly, those technical areas are here to stay and that means you stay as well. None of this charging down the line with waving arms when you score. Same goes for knee slides. It’s entertaining but it drives fans feral. Mourinho infamously ran down the United touchline when his Porto side knocked them out of Europe in 2004 . Don’t go on one of your jaunts and shamelessly pass on tactical information… . It’s one thing to leave your technical area to celebrate (which isn’t really that bad but it is against the rules), yet it is quite another when you do it to pass on tactical information, as you did against PSG in the Champions League in April. Everyone thought you were simply re-enacting your 2004 jog when Porto beat Manchester United. But you kindly confirmed you were passing on tactical instructions to Fernando Torres. We’re not convinced that explanation made it OK. Chelsea boss (second right) admitted he illegally delivered tactics to his players when he ran down the touchline in their Champions League quarter-final win against Paris Saint-Germain last season . Do keep your head during intense rivalries… . Poking the late Tito Villanova in the eye during El Clasico was a low point. In 2011, Mourinho (left) poked then Barcelona assistant Tito Vilanova in the eye while in charge of Real Madrid . Don’t repeatedly bait Arsene Wenger… . Wenger is combustible and he, too, can be provocative, as his recent shove against your chest demonstrated. But there is no need to taunt him so mercilessly. Calling him a ‘specialist in failure’ was rather unkind and the whole voyeur argument was a little unnecessary too. Is the following really how you should speak of a fellow professional: ‘He is someone who likes to watch other people. There are some guys who have this big telescope to see what happens in other families. He must be one of them.’ Wenger’s response was: ‘When you give success to stupid people, it makes them more stupid sometimes and not more intelligent.’ The pair of you sometimes act like articulate five-year-olds. Mourinho (right) has repeatedly goaded Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (left) during his managerial career . Do stay on the right side of diligent and don’t go too far… . It’s true that there have been occasions where you have been punished for comments that others could make without censure. That is a double standard and unfair. But it’s also true that while you are right to speak out against officials for poor decisions – and some of those by Phil Dowd in the Manchester United game on Sunday were poor – you can also go too far. Accusing Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard of visiting referee Anders Frisk at half-time during a Champions League match in 2005 was going too far. Frisk elected to retire because of death threats and you were called ‘an enemy of football’. Referee Anders Frisk (centre right) was forced to retire after receiving death threats . Don’t hide in laundry baskets... You were given a two-game ban for that Frisk incident and, hats off, your alleged solution was ingenious. In the first instance, it is believed you were feeding information to the touchline via a headset worn by fitness coach Rui Faria, disguised by a hat. It is also claimed that you were smuggled out of a dressing room – from which you were banned – in a laundry trolley. All very clever but not allowed. Do be respectful to fans/press… . That means not holding your finger to your lips in front of the Liverpool fans, as you did after your late equaliser in the 2005 League Cup final. You later said it was a gesture to the press, but that’s not OK, either. Mourinho infuriated Liverpool fans with his 'hush' celebration during their 2005 League Cup final vs Chelsea . Don’t wear a scarf and no coat… . Sunday’s look was odd. Like short sleeves and gloves. The Chelsea boss elected to wear a scarf without a coat during Sunday's 1-1 draw at Old Trafford .","Jose Mourinho's touchline antics have become notorious during his career .

"Skyscrapers have an 'unhealthy' link with impending financial collapse, according to banking experts. The news may bring fresh fears to Britain, where the tallest building in Western Europe - The Shard - is nearing completion in London. Researchers pointed to the fact the world's first skyscraper, New York's Equitable Life building, was finished in 1873 during a five-year recession, while the Empire State Building coincided with the Great Depression. China could be in particular trouble as the current biggest builder of skyscrapers, responsible for 53 per cent of those now under construction, according to research from Barclays. India is also at risk, having 14 skyscrapers being built, with only two complete that reach higher than 240m. The pattern repeats itself throughout history, with Chicago's Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower) built in . 1974, just as there was an oil shock. One World Trade Centre in 1972 and Two World Trade Centre the year after came at this time of U.S. currency speculation and worldwide financial crisis. Construction also began on the new One World Trade Centre, formerly known as Freedom Tower, on Ground Zero in 2008. Work on the building, which on . completion next year will become the tallest building in the U.S. at the . symbolic height of 1,776ft in reference to the year of American . independence, coincided with the start of the current financial crisis. Malaysia's Petronas Towers were erected in Kuala Lumpur 1997, at the same time as the Asian financial crisis, while Taipei 101 in Taiwan was finished in 2004, marking the early 2000s recession and the end of the technology bubble. Even the booming city of Dubai almost went bust at the moment it became host to the tallest edifice on the planet, Burj Khalifa. Barclays Capital analysts said: 'Often the world's tallest buildings are simply the edifice of a broader . skyscraper building boom, reflecting a widespread mis-allocation of . capital and an impending economic correction. 'Investors should therefore pay particular attention to China and India,' they added. Barclays Capital's Skyscraper Index has been published every year since 1999. It concluded: 'Our Skyscraper Index continues to show an unhealthy correlation between . construction of the next world's tallest building and an impending . financial crisis: New York 1930; Chicago 1974; Kuala Lumpur 1997 and . Dubai 2010.' The dark portents were supported by a separate report from JPMorgan Chase  cited by the BBC.

"Australian doctors have added to evidence that there can be life after death by reviving a woman 42 minutes after she had been declared dead. Mother-of-two Vanessa Tanasio, 41, was rushed to hospital in Melbourne after suffering a major heart attack at her home in the suburb of Narre Warren.

'Miracle patient': Mrs Tanasio was sitting up in her hospital bed smiling and chatting to her children Ella, 11, and Max, 9, who had come to visit. They are pictured with Sergeant Mark Robertson from the Victoria Police . Mrs Tanasio, described by Australian media as a 'miracle patient', owes her life to a high-tech machine that kept blood flowing to her brain. With her brain continuing to function thanks to the £10,000 device called LUCAS2, surgeons were able to perform emergency treatment on her heart and return it to a normal rhythm. 'I feel excellent, ' Mrs Tanasio said in a brief telephone interview from hospital. 'For someone who has been dead for nearly an hour I am feeling tremendously well.'    A saleswoman with an earth-moving company, Mrs Tanasio said she had not previously been troubled with heart problems. 'This has taken me completely by surprise. I'm relieved to be still here for my children. 'The doctors and nurses have been awesome - the machine is awesome.' Police sergeant Mark Robertson, part of the police team that raised the money for the machine in conjunction with the hospital, told Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper that he was thrilled with Mrs Tanasio's recovery. Dead on arrival: Paramedics tried desperately to revive her in the ambulance but on arrival at the Monash Heart Hospital (pictured) she was declared clinically dead . A hospital spokesman today described Mrs Tanasio's survival as 'astonishing'. Cardiologist Wally Ahmar worked to unblock the arteries to Mrs Tanasio's heart before other doctors moved in to shock the heart back to normal. 'She's in good spirits,' said the hospital spokesman. 'This is exceedingly good news.' Earlier this year, Melbourne man Colin Fiedler, 39, was 'brought back to life' after suffering a major heart attack and was declared clinically dead for more than half an hour. On that occasion, doctors used the same high-tech compression machine which fits around the chest and helps the heart to restart. A New York cardiologist said in a recent interview that there can be life after what is perceived as death as long as the brain is kept functioning. But he said that if the brain becomes severely damaged there would be no quality of life if a patient is brought back to a vegetative state. He told of a Japanese girl who he said had been declared dead for more than three hours but had been resuscitated and was able to live such a normal life that he had heard she had given birth.","Vanessa Tanasio, 41, was rushed to .

"A swirl of swallows, passing through from deep in Africa to the distant north, zipped around the windows of the Al Muntaha restaurant on the 27th floor of the Burj al Arab. It is one of the more delicate wonders of Dubai, communing at eye level with a supreme athlete of the skies. I'm sure these birds have already updated the migratory map imprinted in their navigation system. After all, this sumptuous landmark in the shape of a yacht with billowing sail, where Agassi and Federer once famously played tennis on the helipad, already qualifies as, if not quite 'old', then certainly well-established. It's been here all of 15 years, one of Dubai's few trophy buildings from the 20th Century. Al Muntaha is Arabic for The Ultimate, but that superlative is so widely bestowed in Dubai these days (world's tallest building, and biggest airport, with the ambition to be the world's most visited city - beating London - by 2020) that we may soon have to think of new ones.

They serve 'ultimate' afternoon tea in the mosaic and marble-floored Sahn Eddar, at ground level in the Burj al Arab, for example. Now others do something similar. So I would suggest 'best' high tea with scones and Devon clotted cream, and champagne cocktail with gold dust, served under the world's highest atrium (590ft). Young though it is, touristic Dubai already has dates in its social calendar to rival some of the most famous of the world's grand hotel occasions, such as afternoon tea at Reid's in Madeira and cocktails at Raffles in Singapore. Tea at Sahn Eddar is one. Friday brunch in the Fairmont Dubai is another. I would add an event of my own: a drink at dusk on my ninth-floor balcony in Dubai's Raffles hotel, to take in the whole of that crazy, magnificent, skyline. Let's reduce the appeal of Dubai to this. It's the most brazen, fast-moving, outrageous, exciting and most rapidly updated visitor experience in the world. That view from Raffles wasn't possible ten years ago.

Dubai has done all this frantic building because it wants to base its future on tourism and events such as the Dubai Jazz Festival, Rugby Sevens and international cricket, and its financial sector. Unlike its richer neighbour Abu Dhabi, this emirate never had much oil, and its reserves could be gone by the next decade. Its next big target is Expo 2020 and we can expect it to be unlike anything we have seen before. On one level you could simply treat Dubai as a conventional winter break. A stroll along the strand with your feet in the Indian Ocean in February is certainly a great antidote to the British winter.

Inside and out it makes a good stab at impersonating Tutankhamun's Palace. The only other place on Earth where they do so much gold and marble and huge vaulted space, and with such attention to detail, is Las Vegas. The best way to make sense of Dubai is to ride the elevated Metro Railway. It's brand new, obviously, with seductively curved and gilded stations. Completed in just five years, it connects the airport to a stop close to the major hotels. We crammed into the front of the driverless train to snap the 2014 edition of the towering skyscape. Unreal: The 2,716ft Burj Khalifa is the world's tallest building and gives stunning views over Dubai, right . Twenty-first century travel: The best way to make sense of Dubai is to ride the elevated Metro Railway . There is a better vantage point still for photographs, from the world's highest building, the 2,716ft Burj Khalifa, which is the most unreal structure I've ever seen. After a 120-floor, two-minute, nonstop lift ride we emerged on to the viewing platform. This is as high as some geographers' definition of a mountain. While Abu Dhabi is building its future around worldclass museums, including outposts of the Louvre and the Guggenheim, Dubai prefers to mark its forward march with pure wow and wonder. And it is doing it at a rapid rate. This was my third visit in seven years, and I'm seeing a new Dubai. To put this in perspective, imagine visiting Rome at its peak, then returning a little later to find they had built a Colosseum bigger and grander than the original. So Dubai has the new Al Maktoum International Airport, already partly open. On completion it will be the world's largest passenger and cargo hub. Up to four aircraft will be able to land simultaneously, 24 hours a day, on parallel runways. Ancient meets modern: Wooden ferries still sail up and down Dubai Creek . Dubai is a blur of nationalities. The mixologist who gave me my cocktail-making lesson in Fairmont the Palm was Serbian. The singer was from Texas. The senior staff we spoke to in hotels were Iranian, Russian, French, Moroccan, Syrian and Lebanese. The real Emiratis were more likely to be swishing grandly in their dishdashas out of Waitrose in the Dubai Mall, or standing outside a hotel restaurant, waiting for the valet to deliver the Lamborghini. That sums up how far Dubai has come since the days when tribesmen of the Al Maktoum family measured their wealth against the bounty the pearls divers brought up out of the shallow seas. But some things don't change. You can still wander down to the Creek and, for 20p, take the noisy, smokey and utterly authentic abra ferry. Every time I return, I visit this ancient tableau of open wooden boats scooting over this narrow inlet with foreboding. Have they 'modernised' the Creek? I'm delighted to report that, apart from every offduty boatman being busy on his smartphone, no they haven't. In its fast and furious dash to the future, I think Dubai will be true to its past.

"Roberto Martinez insists Everton’s integrity should not be questioned as he promised Liverpool they will be going all out to torpedo Manchester City’s title hopes. There has been an unusual atmosphere around Merseyside building up to tomorrow’s showdown at Goodison Park, as Liverpool supporters are praying for the home win that would re-hand them the initiative in the race for the Barclays Premier League. Many Evertonians, however, have indicated they would be able to stomach a first home defeat to City in five years as it would prove detrimental to Liverpool’s hopes of becoming domestic champions for the first time since 1990. Focus: Roberto Martinez insists his Everton side will be fully committed to beating Manchester City on Saturday . Martinez, who is surrounded by a . backroom staff full of devout Evertonians, has described the idea of . fans wanting their own team to lose as “banter” but has given an . assurance to their neighbours that his side will not lie down. Everton, . after all, still have an outside chance of finishing in the top four . and he believes two victories over Manuel Pellegrini's side and Hull . City would put pressure on Arsenal, which is why Martinez can say with . certainty that he will be sending his players out to win. 'There . is not even a question mark about us,' said Martinez. 'For us it means . everything to win this game in terms of the overall season. I can . understand the banter between the fans but Liverpool can be assured that . Goodison will be the toughest place for Manchester City to travel this . season, that is for sure. Returning: Both Sylvain Distin (left) and Phil Jagielka (right) could be in line for a return against City . 'We . need to get the six points, that's vital for us. I don't see it as a . serious accusation. I think it is more football rivalry, a bit of . banter, which I can understand. I would be hurt or insulted if we had . nothing to play for and even then our professionalism was in doubt but . that is not even in question now. 'We . have got so much to play for. I still think it would be a major ending . to the season if we were to finish with 75 points. Whatever people might . say on the outside, I don't take it seriously. We have got too much to . fight for.' Each place in . the Barclays Premier League is worth £1.25million in prize money, which . is revenue Everton do not want to lose by falling down the table. There . would also be the side effect of having to start next season in late . July if they finished sixth, as they would go into the Europa League . qualifiers. 'The money you . get for each position is important but it's not just that,' said . Martinez. 'As a professional group and a team we represent Everton. That . means we represent every single player that has played for Everton in . the past and our work for the last ten months. 'You wouldn't come in now and not give your all to finish as good as you can.' Loan stars: Lukaku (above left), Barry (above right), Deulofeu (bottom left) and Traore (bottom right) have been vital in Everton's push for Champions League football this season . Controversial: Roberto Martinez has been criticised for his use of the loan system in shaping his team . This might be new territory as a manager but, during his playing career, he experienced how unusual cross-city enmity can be. 'My . debut with Real Zaragoza was against Atletico Madrid in 1993,' he . recalled. 'It was the last game of the season. Real Madrid were playing . away at Tenerife and Real Madrid had to win to win the league and in . order for Atletico Madrid to get into Europe automatically. 'Real .

"Dexter Brady was born at just 23 weeks old in Iowa City and survived despite 1 in 100 odds and now, at three years old, he continues to defy expectations with his normal, healthy development. Tundi Brady, 45, was expecting twins three years ago. But 22 weeks into her pregnancy, Brady went into labor and lost one of her babies. Beatrix survived for just one minute. But doctors managed to keep her from delivering the other twin, Dexter, for six days with the help of drugs. Scroll down for video... Miracle: Dexter Brady was born at 23 weeks and was about the 'size of a Beanie baby.' Despite all odds, he survived . ‘I was saying goodbye to one baby and waiting for the next to be born and say goodbye,’ said Brady. That’s not quite how it worked out. At a little over 23 weeks, doctors decided to do an emergency Cesarean and deliver the remaining twin. At over three months premature, Dexter weighed 507 grams and was ‘about the size of a Beanie baby.’ Sad: His mother Tundi Brady was expecting twins but lost one of them. After doctors managed to keep her from delivering Dexter she thought she was 'waiting for the next to be born and say goodbye' Serious: Dexter was delivered by c-section at 23 weeks and rushed to a neonatal intensive care unit . High tech: Doctors at the University of Iowa's state-of-the-art neonatal unit acted fast, giving Dexter life-saving drugs to open his lungs and putting him on a ventilator . Getting better: After months on life support, Dexter's health miraculously began to turn around . ‘They scooped him up and put him in an incubator and put a breathing tube down his throat,’ Brady said of the moments after her son’s birth. ‘After a few minutes the doctor came over and said, “We got him -- he's been resuscitated.”’ His chances of survival were around 1 in 100 as he was rushed to the University of Iowa Hospital’s state-of-the-art neonatal intensive care unit. With the help of ventilators, drugs to help open the lungs, and a technology known as continuous positive air pressure, Dexter held on. When things appeared to slowly improve for the baby, doctors told Brady and her husband, who is himself a physician, that they would likely be leaving the hospital with healthy baby. Doubts: Even Dexter's father, himself a physician, found it hard to believe he was finally taking home his son . Survivor: The Bradys were finally able to take Dexter home after months of waiting . Growing up: Now three years old, Dexter (here with his dad) is developing normally, other than being a bit short for his age . Joyful: 'He can pretty much do what any 3-year-old can do,' says Tundi Brady . But Brady’s husband, who’d done a rotation at the very same neonatal unit over a decade previously, didn’t believe it. 'I couldn't figure out why they were lying to me,’ he told his wife at the time. After two months on life support, however, the doctors were proven correct. The Bradys took Dexter home. Now three years old, he continues to defy the odds. Not just surviving, Dexter is thriving and shows no abnormalities other than being short for his age. ‘He can pretty much do what any 3-year-old can do,’ said Brady.

"This is the incredible moment a diver balances a shark on the palm of his hand on the bottom of the ocean floor. The diver - known only as Tom - dove 45-feet in the Bahamas to meet with a pack of 15 Caribbean Reef sharks. He then chose a shark and sent it to sleep by performing a gentle nose rub.

Amazing: This is the incredible moment a diver balances a Caribbean reef shark in the palm of his hand on the bottom of the ocean floor . Danger: The diver - known as Tom - dove 45-feet to the ocean floor to find a pack of 15 Caribbean Reef sharks . American business student Graham Gibson, 31, and his wife Debbie took these incredible photographs in the Bahamas to coincide with the Discovery Channel's World Shark Week. Conservationists - such as the shark hypnotist shown in these pictures - highlight the unusual side to these vulnerable creatures. Mr Gibson said: 'My wife and I were both surprised at how gently and calmly the sharks behaved. 'Right from the beginning, our shark whisperer Tom was able to start hypnotizing one of the sharks. 'It became completely docile in his hands. Once he had calmed the shark, he gently grasped its dorsal fin and turned the shark in the water so that it was parallel to us. 'Moving slowly to avoid disrupting the shark's trance, Tom brought its body towards us until the shark was sitting directly in our laps. My wife and I lightly touched the shark's body and its fins, the skin feeling somewhat like a rubbery, fine-grain sandpaper.' Brave: American business student Graham Gibson, 31, took the pictures in the Bahamas . Tom can be seen with the sharks following his dive . Calm: Tom gently touches this shark as he begins to hypnotise it . Gentle: The sharks become completely docile in his hands of Tom . The shark diver was able to hypnotise the shark by inducing what scientists call 'tonic immobility' or 'apparent death' as it is otherwise known. Tonic immobility is a state of temporary paralysis caused by rubbing the nose of the shark. The effect lasts for around 15 minutes and the shark is not harmed by being gently induced into this state. It's not known exactly why sharks respond to a nose rub in this way - but marine experts believe this could be a defence mechanism.

"Warm and nurturing: Mary Berry is wonderful, and I want her to continue for ever . Do we really want more ancient women on TV? And if so, perhaps we should examine why exactly? My feeling is that people of both sexes over the age of 60 should be doing different things. David Dimbleby gets more irascible as time goes on, while Sir David Frost's show on BBC4 is positively painful to watch – I have to study him closely because I'm afraid that he has stopped breathing. As with most things, it depends on how long the person in question can keep going in their career. Mary Berry is wonderful, and I want her to continue for ever. But with their loud cries for comebacks, Angela Rippon, Joan Bakewell and Selina Scott, who surely landed their TV careers due to their good looks (and, in the case of Rippon, great legs), remind me why this particular sort of older woman is a turn-off. Berry is warm, nurturing and, occasionally, slightly stern, while women such as Bakewell want to continue asking probing, important questions, which, once you are post-menopausal, turns you into a mad, impatient and slightly batty combatant. I know this because this is what I'm like: I fly off the handle, I moan, I have no patience with men or with younger women, and I am intolerant to the point of wanting to punch staff in Sainsbury's who ask me if I have a Nectar card. I nearly had a fight the other day with a young male waiter who asked me to move along one stool at the bar of a swanky restaurant because that would allow another couple to sit down. Comebacks: Angela Rippon, left, and Joan Bakewell, right, remind me why this sort of older woman is a turn-off . An older man would have said 'OK, old chap' and not turned a hair (if he still had hair, that is). But an older woman immediately thinks this is a personal attack on the fact she doesn't have a husband, and is not attractive enough to act as a siren to passing trade. So we become unreasonable, which is OK if you are making cupcakes, but not if you are addressing Barack Obama. Prickly isn't good either – even Jeremy Paxman dusts his dourness with flashes of wry humour. Take Mary Portas, up against the good people of Margate on TV last week. When she found she was unwelcome, she was nearly in tears, forgetting that for most of the time she is a patronising bossy-boots. Or take Woman's Hour presenter Jenni Murray, who peers over her spectacles as you take your seat opposite her in the studio, with barely a smiled hello – an effect that is terrifying when you are a guest. She comes across as a woman with a short fuse, only sympathetic when it comes to cancer or abuse victims, which is when you feel, as a listener, you are being licked by a labrador. Women who ask difficult questions have to do so with a sort of oleaginous charm (as practised by the doe-eyed Emily Maitlis), but that's a tad more difficult to pull off when you are a mere desiccated husk. So, really, what we as a nation have a stomach for is sweet old ladies only, and women who have kept their looks, such as Nigella Lawson. Oh, hang on. It seems they have to be in kitchen settings, too. And I suppose my final point is that looks do matter – or at least grooming. I would listen far more closely to what Germaine Greer has to say if only she could find her comb. I admire Mary Berry and Shirley Williams for their hard work and intelligence, but also for the fact they are soignee. Neither is a great beauty, but both show me they are where they are due to perseverance and modesty. Two great qualities, at any age. PS It seems for animal-lovers sorely disappointed by Tony Blair (not by one centimetre did he increase the size of a battery hen's cage) and Nick Clegg (his manifesto was the most animal-friendly of all, which is why I voted for him, but he has backtracked wildly), that UKIP might be the way forward. In response to a letter asking for his party's stance on animal welfare, an adviser to Stuart Agnew, UKIP's spokesman on agriculture and welfare, sent this: 'The intention is to oppose live animal exports. 'We are concerned that, as the EU . expands, many of the countries joining have little or no interest in . animal welfare and they will have a growing interest over EU policy on . this subject. Bad hair day: I would listen far more closely to what Germaine Greer has to say if she could only find a comb . 'We have seen this indifference to animal welfare crop up in regard to the EU's ban on battery cages and on sow stalls and tethers. 'Many countries have been very slow to react despite long periods of warning. Rest assured, Mr Agnew will continue to speak out on these issues.' They've got my vote.","Do we want more ancient women on TV? If so we should examine why?

"Throughout his first year as a professional, Anthony Joshua has refused to believe the hype. But after stopping Denis Bakhtov in the second round at London's O2 Arena on Saturday night, even he may now begin to dream. Nine fights, nine wins, nine early nights and a first title to boot. Not bad for a man who first laced up his gloves six years ago as a raw 18-year-old. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Anthony Joshua's post fight comments . Anthony Joshua raises his arms after his stunning victory over Denis Bakhtov at the O2 Arena . Joshua (left) batters Bakhtov as the Brit racks up his ninth win in his ninth professional fight . Referee Ian-John Lewis stops the fight in the second round after a brutal assault from the Watford fighter . Bakhtov had not been stopped for almost a decade and had boxed a staggering 250 rounds more than his younger opponent. He was supposed to be a test. But with a grin that would make the Cheshire Cat look solemn, Joshua clobbered the Kazakh from pillar to post. Twelve months ago at the same venue, Joshua made his professional debut after a 12-month hiatus following his Olympic triumph. On that occasion, he relieved Italian Emanuele Leo of his unbeaten record but a year under the watchful eye of Tony Sims has seen him grow into a menacing heavyweight. Joshua made his customary cautious start, but it required just a handful of stiff jabs for him to throw off the shackles. Bakhtov, a veteran of 47 fights, did at least throw back but his response was brief and limited and merely served to refocus the Watford man's mind and sharpen his weapons. Left followed right followed left as Bakhtov's face reddened with every crushing blow while Joshua stretched a smile around his mouth guard in sheer delight.

Joshua celebrates victory in the ring with his team of trainers and promoter Eddie Hearn (right) Surviving to slump on his stool after three torrid minutes was an achievement in itself for the beleaguered visitor but his respite was cruelly short-lived. Joshua, who is yet to go beyond the third round as a professional, laid siege immediately after the bell to start the second session. The referee stepped in but bizarrely allowed them to continue for several seconds before rescuing the stricken and bloodied Bakhtov. Joshua said afterwards: 'He hadn't been stopped so I just wanted to see what he could take. 'He was a strong guy and he wasn't an easy opponent but I wanted to make light work of him. It only went two rounds but I just wanted to hurt him.' And hurt him he did. The WBC International belt now in his possession is little more than expensive bling. But the accompanying world ranking and chilling power will put the heavyweight division on red alert.

"A yet-to-air reality show documenting a rapper, who has fathered eleven children by ten different women, has been slammed by critics who have branded it 'disgusting' and 'negative'. All My Babies' Mamas, set to air this spring on the Oxygen network, follows Carlos 'Shawty Lo' Walker, 36, as he navigates family life in an affluent suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. But after a preview of the one-hour, fly-on-the-wall hit the internet thousands of viewers called for it to be scrapped, with many suggesting it plays on racial stereotypes. Controversial: Rapper Shawty Lo, with his 11 children (sat) and their ten respective mothers and his 19-year-old girlfriend (left) - were  set to star in All My Babies' Mamas but the TV show has now been pulled . A Change.org petition, which has more than 20,000 signatures, states that the show 'stereotypes and demeans black children, mothers and dads'. New York-based Sabrina Lamb, who launched the initiative explains: 'This is not just an attack on African-American parents and children....but all parents and children. 'As dysfunctional and violent as so-called reality shows are, could you ever imagine a one hour spectacle where 11 children are forced to witness their 10 unwed mothers clamor for financial support, emotional attention and sexual reward from Shawty-Lo, the apathetic ‘father’?' Oxygen released a 13-minute trailer promoting the show in December, before production had been completed. Relationship history: E'creia, who gave birth to Mr Walker's first child, explained: 'He might be known as a rapper, but here in Atlanta he¿s known for having eleven kids and ten baby mamas.' Join the club: Liana (left) and Angela (right) have both had children with Atlanta-based rapper Lo Shawty who claims to have had 'a lot of girls' over the years . In the clip, which has has now disappeared from YouTube, Mr Walker is seen talking about managing his music career and the struggle of being a father from the confines of his roomy eight-bedroom mansion. 'How does a guy like me have ten baby mamas eleven kids? It’s heaven,' he boasts in one scene. 'I had a lot of girls... They was in love and, I probably was too. And it just happened' And in another he explains: 'I had a lot of girls... They was in love and, I probably was too. And it just happened.' The trailer also shows him as he fails to remember the names of his eleven teenage children. In an interview with Essence about her . petition Ms Lamb said: 'In the clip I saw, Lo couldn't even remember the . names of all of his 11 children. This is not funny to me. What's funny . about this?' E'creia, who gave birth to Mr Walker's first child and refers to herself as 'The First Lady', introduces the other women who have also had flings with the music star. In the spotlight: Carlos Walker, better known by his stage name Shawty Lo, released his first solo rap album in 2008, but away from the music scene he is busy being a father to 11 children . The mother-of-one gives all of her fellow 'baby mamas' nicknames, such as 'jealous', 'the baby mama from hell' or 'shady baby mama'. So far, just seven of Shawty Lo's ten 'baby mamas' have been named - and each been given her own on-show nickname... Mr Walker's new girlfriend, who is the same age as one of his oldest children, also features in the show. The scantily-clad Ashlin, who will turn 20 this year, tells viewers: 'Me and Carlos have been dating for about a year now and I’m really in love with him.' Many of the other baby mamas believe she will soon fall pregnant. After a trailer promoting All My Babies' Mamas was released, a stream of negative comments flooded social media sites. One YouTube user wrote: 'This show is disgusting we don't need role models like this bunch.' While . another commented on Facebook: 'This is horrible! Pls dont show this! How about a show that will help rebuild our nation instead of . glamourizimg the NEGATIVE?' Despite public outcry, Oxygen has defended its new show. In a statement it said: 'Oxygen’s . one-hour special in development is not meant to be a stereotypical . representation of everyday life for any one demographic or cross-section . of society. Memory recall: Mr Walker struggled to remember the names of his 11 children in a trailer promoting the show .

"Jose Mourinho insists Manchester United are still 'stronger' than Chelsea, despite his side's nine-point lead over David Moyes' struggling champions in the Barclays Premier League table. Chelsea host United at Stamford Bridge on Sunday with Mourinho's return last summer having inspired the Blues to set up a title fight with Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool. By contrast, Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement and Moyes' arrival as his replacement has seen Uited struggle and despite winning the league at a canter last season, United's squad is widely considered paper-thin compared with Chelsea's. Making his point: Jose Mourinho speaks at his Chelsea manager's press conference at Cobham on Friday . Not feeling Blue: Mourinho seemed in good spirits as he put his jacket on his chair . Theatrics: The Portuguese had plenty to say ahead of Chelsea's clash with Manchester United on Sunday . But Mourinho was at pains to point . out it is United who are still playing in defence of their crown, and also . insisted their struggles this term are masking the overall strength . of the team and club. When . asked at his press conference on Friday morning whether this was . Chelsea's biggest match of the season to date, Mourinho said: 'Read the . match programme. My notes. On Sunday read it. 'We don't play against a team who are 11 points behind (the leaders, Arsenal). We play against the champions. We play against Man United. Leading the way: John Terry prepares for Sunday's game with Manchester United . Doing the warm-up: Andre Schurrle and Eden Hazard wear hats and gloves during training . Eyes on the ball: Midfielder Frank Lampard trains at Chelsea's training ground . 'The team that looks to be in the most difficult situation is the team that is stronger in that game.' Mourinho also insisted that his side would struggle to keep pace in the title race with Manuel Pellegrini's free-scoring City side, whose attacking strength has seen them net 99 goals already this season. Neatly, Mourinho will be chasing his 100th win as a Premier League manager this Sunday. 'I think if you look at the table Man City and Arsenal are the top two,' he said. Giving instructions: Mourinho wraps up during training at Chelsea's Cobham base . New boy: Nemanja Matic (right) trains with Demba Ba and his new team-mates at Cobham on Thursday . Ready for the big one: Oscar and Ramires train ahead of the visit of Manchester United . Boys from Brazil: Willian is chased by compatriot Oscar during training . 'Man City's ammunition makes it very difficult. The way this league is, I think the first objective is to secure top four.' Mourinho also added that long-term stability was more important to Chelsea than instant success this season. 'We are not desperate to win the title, we are building towards the future,' he added. 'But also we want to keep the stability, Chelsea's DNA of winning. We want to find the transition of Chelsea in the last decade and the next decade.' Chelsea made their first purchase of the January transfer window on Wednesday, snapping up Nemanja Matic from Benfica for £21million, just under three years after letting the midfielder join the Portuguese giants as a makeweight in the deal to buy David Luiz. Scrappy: Chelsea ground out a goalless draw at Old Trafford earlier this season . Hoodoo: David Moyes (left) has never won in 12 visits to Chelsea and has never beaten a team of Mourinho's . Up for the fight: John Terry and Co are right in the title race whereas United appear to have fallen behind . Matic trained for the first time with his new team-mates on Thursday but Mourinho revealed the Serb would not be part of his starting line-up against United and that he expects Matic may not make an impact in the Premier League until next season. 'I'm sure he will have an impact,' said Mourinho. 'I'm happy he came now as it gives him the next five months to be with the team ahead of next season. 'He will be part of the team we hope to build for many years. In terms of our future, his profile is perfect.' Mourinho also revealed that he does not expect too many more signings this winter, while Kevin De Bruyne and Ryan Bertrand will leave for Wolfsburg and Aston Villa respectively.

"The FBI is on course to have a controversial face scanning system and database up and running by the summer. New documents released by the Electronic Frontier Foundation reveal the system is capable of processing 55,000 faces a day - and that it will have 52 million faces by 2015. The database, shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal, state and local law enforcement agencies across the United States, already has 7-8 million individuals. The database, shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal, state and local law enforcement agencies across the United States, already has 7-8 million individuals loaded. The Next Generation Identification (NGI) system builds on the FBI’s legacy fingerprint database, which already contains well over 100 million individual records, and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data, including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data. NGI combines all these forms of data in each individual’s file, linking them to personal and biographic data like name, home address, ID number, immigration status, age, race, etc. This immense database is shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal, state and local law enforcement agencies across the United States. However, the extent of the system has not been revealed until now. 'The records we received show that the face recognition component of NGI may include as many as 52 million face images by 2015,' the EFF's Jennifer Lynch said. The latest documents also reveal that non-criminal photos will be included. 'One of our biggest concerns about NGI has been the fact that it will include non-criminal as well as criminal face images,' the EFF said. 'We now know that FBI projects that by 2015, the database will include 4.3 million images taken for non-criminal purposes. The EFF received the records in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit for information on Next Generation Identification (NGI). The system builds on the FBI’s legacy fingerprint database, which already contains well over 100 million individual records, and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data, including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data.

By 2012, NGI already contained 13.6 million images representing between 7 and 8 million individuals, and by the middle of 2013, the size of the database increased to 16 million images. The new records reveal that the database will be capable of processing 55,000 direct photo enrollments daily and of conducting tens of thousands of searches every day. Currently, if you apply for any type of job that requires fingerprinting or a background check, your prints are sent to and stored by the FBI in its civil print database. However, the FBI has never before collected a photograph along with those prints - but this is changing with NGI. Now an employer could require you to provide a 'mug shot' photo along with your fingerprints. If that’s the case, then the FBI will store both your face print and your fingerprints along with your biographic data. The new system also link criminal and non-criminal fingerprint databases. Every record—whether criminal or non—will have a “Universal Control Number” (UCN), and every search will be run against all records in the database. 'This means that even if you have never been arrested for a crime, if your employer requires you to submit a photo as part of your background check, your face image could be searched—and you could be implicated as a criminal suspect—just by virtue of having that image in the non-criminal file, sayd the EFF. It says the new system raises major privacy concerns. The system builds on the FBI¿s legacy fingerprint database, which already contains well over 100 million individual records, and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data, including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data. 'NGI will allow law enforcement at all levels to search non-criminal and criminal face records at the same time. 'This means you could become a suspect in a criminal case merely because you applied for a job that required you to submit a photo with your background check. The states taking part in the project . 'Second, the FBI and Congress have thus far failed to enact meaningful restrictions on what types of data can be submitted to the system, who can access the data, and how the data can be used.

"When you feel blue, or something goes wrong, what do you do? Most would say put on a brave face or looking on the bright side is best. After all, what’s the point in crying over spilt milk? But a revolutionary new book says such a stiff upper lip could do you far more harm than good. In Constructive Wallowing, renowned U.S. psychologist Tina Gilbertson makes the extraordinary claim that dwelling on our bad feelings is, in fact, the key to health and happiness. All by myself: Even film character Bridget Jones (pictured) recognised the importance of a good wallow to recuperate after a heart-ache . Gilbertson discovered this method after seeking therapy for her own depression, and realising she had always held in negative feelings as her parents had discouraged her from crying as a child. It was only in accepting them, and allowing herself to feel her sadness and pain fully, that they finally started to dissipate and she began to recover. When she became a therapist, she started to encourage her clients to try such ‘constructive wallowing’ themselves, and noted how beneficial it was. Dr Jay Watts, a London-based consultant clinical psychologist, believes her method is convincing. She says: ‘We Brits have a reputation for holding our emotions in. ‘As well as a fear of judgment — such as being seen as a “hysterical woman” — strong emotions can feel scary. But if we don’t deal with them they will only rear their heads again, potentially leading to deep-seated psychological problems.’ Of course, there’s a difference between self-destructive moping — comfort eating, drowning your sorrows in alcohol or lashing out — and constructive wallowing. Indeed, Gilbertson says her step-by-step guide to wallowing constructively, without shame, could help you avoid this kind of destructive behaviour altogether. It could even be the key to happier relationships, more energy, greater confidence and even good health, as it can reduce the kind of chronic stress that leads to high blood pressure, a lowered immune system and loss of libido. Here, in this exclusive adaptation, we show how constructive wallowing can help you safely beat bad feelings by allowing yourself to have them in the first place — leaving you happier than ever. This quick quiz will give you a sense of your relationship with your emotions — and how those feelings are influencing your life. Give yourself a point for every statement you agree with, and half a point where you find yourself on the fence. Once you’ve done it, cut it out and keep it so once you’ve tried constructive wallowing for a week or two, you can take the quiz again to see how your outlook has changed . . . How to wallow: Try to set aside at least an hour and find a private place such as a bedroom or a bath. Avoid alcohol, food and other distractions such as the radio or your phone . SCORE OF 0-4: You already have a great deal of self-compassion and allow yourself to wallow when you need to. SCORE OF 5-9: You have some positive feelings about yourself but could enjoy the extra energy that constructive wallowing will bring. SCORE OF 10-14: You’re too self-critical. Learning how and when to wallow will boost your self-esteem and improve your relationships. SCORE OF 15+: You’re probably exhausted from trying not to let your emotions show. Wallowing could be life-changing for you. Wallowing is like brushing your teeth; it’s a great thing to do, but not at a cocktail party. Try to find a chunk of time between all your obligations, but remember if you’re feeling stuck or emotional, the only constructive use of your time is to pay attention to your emotions, as they won’t let you go until you do. Try to set aside at least an hour and find a private place such as a bedroom or a bath. Avoid alcohol, food and other distractions such as the radio or your phone. Spend as long as you need and take tissues with you. But a little bit of wallowing, even five minutes, is better than never wallowing at all: you can even do it while queuing, stuck in traffic or hoovering. Constructive wallowing is a formal five-step process Gilbertson has christened the TRUTH technique. It’s not a one-time fix, but a blueprint for a new way of living that you must constantly practice. Before you begin, take at least ten breaths and let your body relax. Go through each step as slowly as you need to, and stop when it feels natural — it could take a minute or an hour. Let your emotions spill out and feel each one fully. Tell yourself the situation. For example, if a friend has let you down or you’re upset about what someone has said to you.Realise . what you’re feeling. Try to put words to what you’re experiencing, for . example: ‘I feel humiliated,’ or: ‘I’m dreading my sister’s wedding.’Uncover . self-criticism. Often negative feelings like envy, dislike or . disappointment make you feel like you’re an envious, hateful, weak . person — but you’re not. Good people feel angry, jealous and impatient, . too.  So root out impatience with yourself and don’t think you’re too . sensitive. You’re allowed to feel how you feel. Try . to understand yourself. Look for reasons why a good person would feel . this way. It’s OK to want that promotion over someone else, even if they . did deserve it. Have the feeling. Just sit with it, cry about it, talk to yourself about it, hug or punch  a pillow — whatever you need  to do. Many people worry that if they allow themselves to fully experience their negative feelings, they might fall into a metaphorical black hole and never get out. Others think it’s a sign of weakness to mope and, of course, it can be painful to cry. But when we ignore feelings, they get stuck inside us and multiply. This, Gilbertson explains, is known as the ‘escalation cycle’, and it goes like this: when you have a bad feeling — anything from losing a friend to getting angry over a late train — you may suppress it because it seems inconvenient, too painful or too big. Do despair: Many people worry that if they allow themselves to fully experience their negative feelings, they might fall into a metaphorical black hole and never get out . Instead, you might turn to food, alcohol, shopping, sex or another activity that blanks out your true emotional state with temporary good feelings. Or you might have trained yourself to ignore unpleasant feelings altogether. Either way, feelings get stuffed inside, festering and piling up until one of two things happens. Either they eventually explode in a form of destructive behaviour (just think of how you can erupt into a temper over something seemingly minor after a day full of niggles), which gives some brief relief, but may well leave you feeling full of remorse. Or, they are buried even deeper, which can eventually lead to chronic emotional and even physical pain, leading to breakdowns, anxiety or stress. Constructive wallowing stops this cycle. It’s much healthier to acknowledge each bad feeling so you can deal with it, get over it and move on. It sounds strange, encouraging you to do something which feels bad to make you feel better. But according to Gilbertson, mentally crying ‘Ouch!’ when life hurts you will make you feel more peaceful and less anxious. Contrary to conventional wisdom, wallowing over something that happened months or years ago is good if it’s bothering you now. While nothing can change the past, it doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to have feelings about it. You’re not hanging on to the bad things — it’s the other way round: your feelings still have hold of you. In order to help those memories disappear, you have to deal with them properly. Remember, feelings are not values. If you feel indignant about something, it’s not because you’re an indignant person — you’re just indignant about a particular thing. Tackle your hang-ups: Contrary to conventional wisdom, wallowing over something that happened months or years ago is good if it's bothering you now . Don’t make a moral judgment out of having an unpleasant feeling. Only judge yourself by your actions. We often forget that having an emotion is not the same as acting on it: feeling angry is not the same as swearing. We can feel one way and act another. This means we shouldn’t keep a stranglehold on negative emotions. Allowing yourself to experience them without judgment is at the centre of constructive wallowing and, says Gilbertson, one of the most liberating things you can do. Wallowing does not mean holding on to anger. Forgiveness and moving on comes naturally after a period of constructive wallowing, when you have allowed yourself to experience bad feelings, and then let them go. It’s not necessary to make  yourself feel forgiveness towards someone who’s hurt you, it happens naturally. In the same way, if you’re worried about opening the floodgates of your emotions and not being able to stop crying once you’ve started, trust that wallowing has a natural end. Just make sure you give yourself enough time when you sit down to do it. You’ll be amazed by the difference it will make to your life.","'Constructive Wallowing' is a new theory on coping with unhappiness .

"A five-year-old boy helped save his father's life when he suffered a stroke while driving, after calmly guiding police to their car on Sunday. Oregon police were having trouble finding Richard Paget, but the 46-year-old's son, Dax, was able to give a detailed description of where his father had pulled over. The father and son, from Spokane, Washington, had been driving to Oregon City at about 7.30am when Dax called his mother to say Mr Paget was sick. Hero: Dax, 5, was able to help officers find his sick father by describing where their car was parked . Rachael Ballard, who was at home at the time, contacted the police who were able to use her husband's cell phone signal to track him to a 15-mile radius, according to ABC News. When they called the phone, Mr Paget's speech was too garbled but five-year-old Dax confidently took the phone and clearly answered officer's questions. 'I don't have kids, but when I do I hope . they turn out like Dax,' Oregon State Police Trooper Joseph Dezso said. 'He is a super brave, super intelligent little man.' He added: '[Dax] immediately started talking to me about where they were and what was going on. He started leading us in the right direction.' Showing remarkable calm for a young boy, Dax described to officers where their car was parked, telling them there were some buildings nearby and a railway track a train had just traveled down. He was able to tell them the color of the buildings and where they had been driving, to help officers pinpoint their car. More importantly, he was able to relay information about his father's symptoms, telling police he could not wake his father up and that Mr Paget had lost feeling in the right side of his face and body. The details of the railway track in particular helped officers find Mr Paget's location and rush to his aid. Rescue:  Police chat to Dax by the side of the road as a medical team helps his father . Life saver: Police say the calm five-year-old's accurate descriptions helped them find his father quickly . 'Everything that he answered was spot . on. Where they were at, there were only a couple of . buildings around them, and [Dax] described them in detail. That, along . with the fact that the train was passing by, was very helpful for us to . get there as quickly as we could,' police spokesman Gregg Hastings said. When . an officer found their car, Dax was waiting with his father who had . lost all ability to speak, was drifting out of consciousness and was . unable to move one side of his body. Mr Paget was rushed to hospital, where he is said to be in a satisfactory condition, according to ABC News. While . an ambulance crew helped his father, Dax was allowed to sit in Trooper . Dezso's car and was driven back to the police station while Mr Paget was . taken to hospital. Despite . the dramatic start to their day, Mr Paget's son still wants to be a . police officer and enjoyed spending time with the trooper, his mother . told KEPRTV. Ride: As an ambulance took Richard Paget to hospital Dax got a ride in a police car . 'He is a very bright young man and . definitely saved his dad's life. We are so glad to hear his father . should pull through,' Trooper Dezso said. Mrs Bardwell had only recently showed Dax how to unlock a phone and call his parents if there was an emergency. She said he was able to remember her instructions and alert her to the problem with his father.","Washington boy helps rescue by describing where car was parked .

"The grandparents of a four-month-old girl orphaned after her father, a Kansas City Chiefs player, shot her mother and himself are locked in a custody battle over the $3million baby. Linebacker Jovan Belcher shot daughter Zoey's mother, Kasandra Perkins, nine times on December 1 before driving to Arrowhead stadium and shooting himself. Belcher's mother, Cheryl Shepherd, is seeking custody of Zoey and to be appointed conservator of her estate. The baby's maternal grandparents and other relatives in Texas are also seeking custody. Custody battle: Belcher is seen here with his girlfriend Kasandra Perkins, 22, and their baby daughter Zoey who with their death is at the heart of a $3million custody battle . After her parent's death, Zoey was . turned over to Belcher's mother by authorities but temporarily allowed . Kasandra's parents to take her to Texas for her mother's funeral. The maternal grandparents have now have cut off . communication with Shepherd and have refused to return Zoey to their . care, according to The Kansas City Star. The other woman: Brittni Glass spent the night with Belcher before he murdered his girlfriend but has since denied the two had a sexual relationship . It is believed that the murder suicide took place after a row about whether or not Belcher was the Zoey's father. His suicide was witnessed by coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli. A source told the New York Post: . '[Cheryl] believed that there was an issue over whether [Belcher] was . the father. She said he believed he wasn’t necessarily the father of . the child.' A Kansas City law-enforcement source confirmed: 'She told police there was a question about the paternity.' The . source added: 'The implication was that paternity was what the two of . them were fighting about — that the baby might not have been his.' The couple had been receiving counselling for relationship and financial problems, police said. A spokeswoman said she would not comment on the doubts raised over baby Zoey's paternity. Hearings are scheduled this month to decide where the four-month-old will go and the money to support her. Belcher's daughter is due to receive a sizeable income over her lifetime after the December murder suicide at . the hands of her NFL player father. Zoey's estate or guardian will also receive more than $1 million under the terms of the NFL's collective bargaining agreement. She will receive $108,000 annually for the next four years, $48,000 in the fifth year and $52,000 every year until she turns 18. If she goes to college it will last until she is 23. The beneficiary will also receive $600,000 in life insurance and $200,000 for every season. Belcher was in his third. A retirement . account with $100,000 will also go to his estate. Though there seemed to be no motive . for the senseless killings, it emerged last month that the NFL player . had a secret girlfriend who he allegedly told he would shoot Perkins 'if . she didn't leave him alone'. Belcher is also believed to have had . drinks and dinner with Brittni Glass before he arrived home, shot his . girlfriend after a blazing row, and then ended his own life. Details of the Belcher case are contained in police reports submitted to the Jackson County prosecutor, who has ruled the event a murder-suicide. They include dozens of interviews with witnesses. Glass has denied the two were in a relationship. Glass, also 22, told police that Belcher complained about Perkins threatening to take all his money and the baby if they broke up. He said Perkins 'knew exactly how to press his buttons and make him angry,' according to a summary of the woman's interview with police. Belcher had been with the woman and some of her friends at a downtown Kansas City entertainment district the night before the shooting, the woman said. He spent part of the night in her apartment and part of it sleeping in his car before going home early in the morning, the report said. He and Perkins were arguing before he shot her, his mother, Cheryl Shepherd, told police. Shepherd had moved in with the couple two weeks earlier to help care for the baby. Shepherd heard Belcher say 'You won't talk to me that way' and then she heard a thump and gunshots. Shepherd rushed into the bedroom and found Perkins lying on the bathroom floor, she told police. Before fleeing the house, Belcher knelt next to Perkins, apologized and repeatedly kissed her, his daughter and his mother, Shepherd said. Troubled: The murder-suicide has sparked debate in the NFL about gun ownership and the personal struggles of players . Belcher drove off in his Bentley to . the practice facility at Arrowhead several miles away, where he pulled . into the parking lot and saw Pioli, the report said. Pioli quoted Belcher as saying, 'I . did it, I killed her.' Belcher held a handgun to his own head. 'I got to . go, can't be here, and take care of my daughter,' Pioli recalled . Belcher saying. He had asked to speak with Crennel . and linebacker coach Gary Gibbs, the report said. Crennel told police he . pleaded with Belcher to put down the gun. One witness said she heard . Crennel say, 'you're taking the easy way out'. Belcher lowered the gun, but only to load a round into the chamber, Crennel told police. Seeing a police officer in the distance and hearing sirens, Belcher knelt behind a mini-van, blessed himself and fired the gun into his temple, the report said. It had also been reported that there were questions over the paternity of Zoey and Cheryl said that this is what they argued over before the shooting. Paying respects: Hundreds of mourners memorialized Jovan Belcher at his funeral - despite his murdering the mother of his child before committing suicide . Memorial: Jovan Belcher was eulogized as a 'humble, kind young man' by his mother as his family and friends grappled with the horror of what he did . Cheryl Shepherd was in the home when . her son shot Kasandra ten times before fleeing. He is believed to have . kissed her dying body and their baby daughter goodbye before he left. The horrific murder suicide has shaken the NFL and begun a discussion of gun ownership and mental health issues. At least seven players have given up their guns - handing them over to the security personnel for their teams, Sports Illustrated reports. The funeral was at Upper Room Christian Church in Dix Hills, New York, near his hometown on Long Island . Then appeared the words 'In loving memory of' Belcher and Kasandra Perkins. After a series of pictures of Perkins and baby Zoey came the message, 'Keep this little girl in your prayers.' 'The legacy we pass on to her will be good,' said his uncle, Davin Miles. Next . to an open casket at his funeral were collages of photos and mementos from Belcher's . playing career. An array of flowers spelled out W.B. for his high . school. Belcher then drove to Arrowhead . Stadium, where he thanked coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott . Pioli for all they'd done for him. As police arrived, Belcher slipped . behind a car and put the gun to his head. His . path to becoming an NFL starter had been an unlikely one. Belcher did . not play in college football's top division, and he wasn't drafted. But . he made the Chiefs, becoming a full-time starter in 2010. Bishop . Stephanie Green described Belcher as 'a man who did some awesome things . - while other young men his age were out hustling, slinging and doing . other things, he chose an education'.","Authorities handed baby daughter to Belcher's parents after his death .

"A senior Afghan commander who has advised the Prime Minister has warned that withdrawing British troops from Afghanistan will spark a ‘global jihad’. The damaging comments come on the day David Cameron hosts a high-profile summit at Chequers to discuss plans to combat the Taliban and other terrorist threats after American and British troops pull out next year. But in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Colonel Amin Jan of the Afghan National Army (ANA) said that removing British forces from Afghanistan will allow Al Qaeda and the Taliban to seize power. Combat zone: Col Jan, second left, with David Cameron and Chief of Defence Staff General Sir David Richards at Camp Bastion in 2011 . The officer also claimed that ANA troops are not good enough to defeat  the insurgents – a statement that is politically embarrassing for the Prime Minister, as these troops have been trained by UK mentors for the past three years. Britain’s exit strategy hinges on national forces being able to combat the Taliban. But Col Jan – the second most senior Afghan commander in Helmand province – accused politicians of making misleading assessments of Afghan troops’ capabilities to justify their  decision to accelerate the pull out of international forces. Tonight Mr Cameron will dine at  his country retreat with Pakistan President Asif Zardari and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, ahead of in-depth talks on the region’s security on Monday. The Prime Minister has pledged to pull out all British troops next year, before the next Election. But already numbers are being cut back and bases in tactically crucial areas being closed down. When asked if 2014 was the right time for a handover, Col Jan said: ‘No, I would say that it is too early, because the situation will not have ended. If the British leave, the jihadists will see it as a good sign. A worldwide jihad will take place. That is my view.’ And when asked if the ANA could defeat the Taliban without international help, he said: ‘Our leaders might say we are able to do the task, but it will be difficult. Ready for action? Afghan forces fire a shell, visible above the left-hand soldier's head . ‘We have enough soldiers, we have the quantity, but we need  the quality. We need more  professional and better trained commanders. ‘Do the British want Afghanistan to return to being a Taliban state? That is the prospect.’ As recently as December, Mr Cameron praised the Afghan forces for their readiness to tackle the Taliban after the withdrawal. Addressing British troops in Camp Bastion, he said: ‘Frankly, the Afghan army is doing better than we expected, there’s more of them than we expected and that’s why we are able to bring home so many troops.’ Col Jan, 55, is the deputy commander of a brigade of 4,500 soldiers in Helmand, where fighting against the Taliban has been most intense. He is also respected for his resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan during the Eighties. He is in no doubt that pressure from the British public is the driving force behind the withdrawal of troops from Helmand, but warned: ‘People in Britain should consider what the future is for Afghanistan and the world. ‘Think about whether you would like Afghanistan to go back to being a Taliban state and a home for terrorism. Think about throwing away the progress made over the past ten years. ‘The biggest problem we have is to provide security in the most volatile areas of the country.’ Fighting fit: Local ANA troops in training at Camp Shorabak in Helmand province, Afghanistan . Whatever his motivation for suggesting that his troops are incapable of resisting the insurgents, Col Jan’s comments contrast sharply with the official British line. Lieutenant Colonel Ben Wrench, commander of the British group which oversees the mentoring of Afghan troops in Helmand, told The Mail on Sunday that the enemy had been reduced to banditry and were no longer worthy of being called ‘insurgents’. ‘Back in 2010 we were holding the ANA’s hands and doing their planning,’ he said. ‘Now we are sitting right back. In terms of capability they are way past the tipping point and in another year’s time they will have the ability to manoeuvre all their troops and assets as one. ‘When we leave I would expect a stand-off, a power struggle, but with the Afghan security forces winning out. The enemy is fractured. They are more like bandits today. They are hardly an insurgency, to call them one is doing them a favour.’ Many other local commanders also praised the ANA, insisting the troops were successfully  conducting strike operations against Taliban strongholds with very limited UK support. However, Col Jan said that the Taliban would rise after the  British and international forces withdraw, aided by Afghanistan’s neighbours seeking to destabilise the country. He said: ‘Pakistan is at the root of the problem. I know what is happening there because I live on the  border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pakistan is training the Taliban over the border and giving homes to their commanders. The international community needs to put more pressure on Pakistan to stop this before it is too late. We know that Iran is involved as well.’ Fine dining: Mr Cameron (pictured eating breakfast with British forces at Camp Bastion in 2010) will dine at his country retreat with Pakistan President Asif Zardari and Afghan President Hamid Karzai ahead of talks on the region's security . Col Jan has previously offered first-hand advice to British politicians. In 2011, he met Mr Cameron in Helmand, and a photograph of them deep in discussion hangs on his office wall at Camp Shorabak, next to Camp  Bastion, where thousands of local recruits go through basic training. Last month Col Jan hosted a visit to Camp Shorabak by Armed Forces Minister Andrew Robathan. Afterwards, Mr Robathan said the transition to Afghan security was going ‘extremely well’. Col Jan has also visited the UK, most recently in December to take part in an exercise to strengthen the relationship between British and Afghan officers. A British Government spokesman said last night: ‘Afghan forces are already responsible for more than 75 per cent of the population and by the end of 2014, Afghanistan will have a well-trained and capable national security force of over 300,000. ‘The international community’s support for the Afghan Government won’t end with the withdrawal of troops at the end of 2014. Commitments will provide £2.5 billion a year for security until 2017 and £2.5 billion a year for development to help to underpin Afghanistan’s future stability. ‘It is vital that the process is Afghan-led – this is what the Afghan people want.’ Gurkha troops based at Britain’s . bloodiest outpost in Helmand province have handed control to Afghan . police after finally securing peace there. Patrol . Base 4, in the province’s Nahr-e Bughra district, was once dubbed The . Heart Of Darkness and has seen some of the campaign’s most intense . fighting. At least 12 . British soldiers have died there, including two soldiers who were . killed, along with 17 injured, in a Taliban attack in 2009.

"The unborn baby of pregnant body-in-suitcase murder accused Heather Mack now has a lawyer to look after his or her interests as it becomes increasingly clear the child will be born in an Indonesian jail, MailOnline can reveal. Vanessa Favia arrived on the tropical island of Bali on Monday along with Mack's Chicago-based lawyer Michael Elkin to make sure the baby, due in early spring, gets all the help it needs. Favia - who has been photographed exclusively by MailOnline examining an ultrasound image of the unborn baby - has been looking at the child's immediate future after its birth. Scroll down for video . Humanitarian: Heather Mack, right, meets with US family law expert Vanessa Favia in a clinic in Bali. Favia has flown out to the Indonesian island to look after the interests of Mack's unborn child . Born into trauma: Favia and Mack's Chicago-based lawyer Michael Elkin study a copy of the child's ultrasound . Mack's Indonesian lawyer Raja Nasution told MailOnline that Favia, 35, will 'ensure that the humanitarian and governmental interests of Heather's unborn child are safeguarded now and in the future.' Heather, 19, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, both from the Chicago area, are awaiting charges in the death of Heather's mother, wealthy socialite Sheila von Wiese Mack whose was killed on August 12. The two are accused of bludgeoning the 62-year-old widow to death in her hotel room in Bali and cramming the battered body into a piece of luggage. They are said to have taken the suitcase down to the hotel lobby and given it to a taxi driver, saying they would be back. After two hours, and with blood starting to seep from the case the driver went to police who found the young lovers asleep in each other's arms in a hotel near the island's international airport. Favia and Elkin flew to Bali to help prepare Heather's case and look after the interests of the baby. Elkin told MailOnline before he left that Nasution's team has now been in touch with lawyers working for Schaefer. Sources in Bali say Favia is paying particular interest in the health of the unborn baby and has been advised on the likely possibility that the child will be born while Miss Mack is still behind bars as her trial proceeds through the laborious Indonesian legal system. Mack and Schaefer both face the possibility of execution by firing squad if found guilty of murder. Death penalty: Mack, pictured left with her mother, Sheila von Wiese Mack and right, with boyfriend Tommy Schaefer) faces the death penalty along with Schaefer, if they are found guilty of Mrs von Wiese Mack . Austere: Mothers being detained in Bali's notorious Kerobokan Prison, where Mack will spend many years if she is convicted of murder and spared execution, are only allowed to keep babies with them until they are two . New mothers being detained in Bali’s notorious Kerobokan Prison, where Heather Mack will spend many years if she is convicted of murder and spared execution, are allowed to keep their babies with them until they are two-years-old. Then they are either handed over to relatives or placed in care with local families or charity groups. Favia and Elkin attended the Trijata Police Clinic in the Balinesw capital Denpasar on Wednesday where Mack's health and that of her unborn child were checked. The two attorneys spent some time examining an ultrasound image which they had been allowed to photograph on an iPhone. Five other lawyers who have been appointed by prosecutors and are currently working without charge also went along to the clinic, along with several senior police officers. Neither lawyer would make any comment during the clinic visit, but Elkin released a statement saying they were in Bali to assist Nasution and fellow Indonesian lawyer Lily Lubis, 'in any manner that they feel is appropriate and necessary.' According to Favia's page on the legal website AVVO, she is based in the Chicago suburb of Oakbrook Terrace. Nasution said she has worked 'on behalf of abused and neglected children in the juvenile court system' and she will handle the case 'in the most appropriate and necessary manner.' However, it is understood the two U.S lawyers will have no standing in any local court and their presence is to aid Nasution and his team. Indonesian prosecutors and senior police have made it clear that despite reports that attempts will be made to move Mack and Schaefer to the U.S. to face unrelated charges there, they will face judges in Denpasar. The couple's two hours of relative freedom from the monotony of prison life began on Wednesday when they were each taken from their cells and escorted to the clinic. Laborious: Despite reported attempts to fly Mack and Schaefer to the US to face trial there on unrelated charges, Indonesian prosecutors have made it clear they'll face justice in Bali first, which is notoriously slow . Check up: Schaefer hid his face as he was also taken to the clinic from his cell for a medical examination . For Schaefer, dressed in an orange prison top and with his wrists handcuffed, it was a brief three minute ride in a police car from Denpasar police headquarters to the clinic, arriving 15 minutes before his girlfriend and eventually leaving five minutes after her. Heather, who has complained of being held in isolation in a cell at South Kuta police station, wore a blue baseball cap, a red top and white shorts for her 25-minute road trip for her appointment with the doctors. Her psychological and physical health - along with the condition of her unborn baby - were checked, the US lawyers waiting patiently while the examinations took place. Though the American attorneys are in Bali to learn about the case against Mack, it is understood they have also been briefed about the pending charges against Schaefer. Schaefer's mother Kia Walker has set up a fundraising effort on the YouCaring website which has so far raised $8,816 towards a goal of $100,000. 'Tommy desperately needs to raise money to pay for a lawyer in Indonesia,' Walker wrote on the site. 'I love and care deeply for my son.' She said she needed the money to pay for legal services in Indonesia as well as food, medicine and other necessities. 'Prisoners are expected to pay for their basic needs,' she wrote. 'Tommy and I will be grateful for anything you can donate,' Walker added. When contacted by MailOnline she said she has been advised to say no more about the case. Schaefer and Mack have been kept in separate cells to prevent them consulting with one another during the murder investigation - although until now neither has co-operated with police. Police commander Djoko Hariutomo has told MailOnline that the case against the couple is very strong. Gruesome: Mack and Schaefer are alleged to have stuffed von Wiese Mack's body in this suitcase and taken it out to a waiting taxi. When they didn't return for two hours, blood began to seep out and the alarm was raised . Bali Police revealed that Mrs Mack was killed when she was hit about the head and face by a heavy glass ashtray and a vase in the bedroom she was sharing with her daughter Heather at the plush St Regis Hotel in the beachside Nusa Dua district of Bali. Police claim it came hours after the trio were seen on hotel surveillance cameras in the lobby of the hotel arguing over who would pay the bill. They say they have CCTV evidence of Schaefer carrying the suitcase in the stairway of the hotel after Mrs Mack was killed. Mack and Schaefer are not expected to appear in court for several weeks, when, police say, they will be formally charged with murder. Under Indonesia’s legal system, they have already been 'designated' - meaning that murder charges have been drawn up against them and will become 'active' when they go to court.","Family law expert Vanessa Favia has arrived on island with Heather Mack's Chicago lawyer Michael Elkin .

"NASCAR superstar Tony Stewart has gone into hiding after the weekend crash that killed fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr in a sprint car race in upstate New York. Stewart's private plane flew into his hometown of Columbus, Indiana, on Monday and luggage was loaded on to it and it then flew out again, airport director Brian Payne told MailOnline. Stewart is 'staying with friends', his . team's spokesman Mike Arning said. He still has made no decision on when . to return to racing. Gone: Beleaguered NASCAR driver Tony Stewart has flown the coop following the crash killing fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr. It is believed he flew off to parts unknown . High flyer:  It is believed Stewart took off in his $6 million 10-seater Dassault-Breguet Falcon 50, similar to the one pictured here. Stewart's plane has a skull with a top hat with 'smoke' - Stewart's logo - surrounded by flames painted on the tail . 'It was only here 10 or 15 minutes,' said Payne. 'I don't know whether Stewart was on board, but he certainly did not get off.' Payne would not say where the plane was headed. According to the website FlightAware which follows the movements of private planes, Stewart's 10-seater Dassault-Breguet Falcon 50, plane which can cost $6million or more, cannot be tracked publicly 'per request from the owner/operator'. County sheriff Philip C. Povero announced his office will continue the investigation into Kevin Ward Jr's shocking death for at least two more weeks. 'Investigators continue to seek witnesses, gather evidence and develop racetrack crash reconstruction,' Povero said. Kevin Ward Sr told Syracuse.com that his son was dressed in an orange and black suit with fluorescent stripes down the sides that glowed under the lights. 'Apparently, Tony Stewart was the only one driving out there who didn't see him,' he said. Stewart's decision to disappear from public view also comes as criticism for his role in Saturday's accident that killed 20-year-old racer Kevin Ward Jr. at the Canandaigua Motorsports Park has heated up. Many fans blame Stewart, 43, for the death even though Ward had walked along the track to confront the older driver after being forced off the track. Even in his home state opinions are divided. Bob Kravitz, a columnist for the Indianapolis Star, was skeptical about Stewart's claims of innocence. 'Ultimately, only Tony Stewart knows whether he accidentally or willfully ran over and killed Kevin Ward Jr,' Kravitz wrote. 'If it was an accident, and we prefer to believe that's the case, he will be able to live with himself, although the memory will remain with him always. Driven: Ward was on the darkened dirt track Canandaigua Motorsports Park in Central Square, N.Y., trying to confront Stewart following a bump with Stewart one lap earlier when he was fatally hit by Stewart . 'If he was overcome by rage and did less than his best to avoid the 20-year-old Ward, Jr., he will have to live with that messy lie the rest of his natural life.' Stewart's only comment on the tragedy was to issue a statement on Sunday saying: 'There aren’t words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr. It’s a very emotional time for all involved…. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and everyone affected by this tragedy.' But even that statement was attacked by Ward's aunt Wendi Ward who sarcastically tweeted the message 'Thanks for thinking of our family Tony Stewart when you decided to be a d—k!' Authorities are looking at two separate videos of the incident taken by fans at Canandaigua. They appear to show Stewart accelerating as he came close to Ward, who was wearing dark clothing. He hit the younger driver with his rear right tire pulling him beneath the car and then throwing him in the air. Ward died of massive blunt trauma to the head, an autopsy found. The accident occurred around 10.30 pm. Stewart's camp has claimed the driver did not see him, but another driver, Paul Kinney, told NBC News: 'Only Tony knows exactly what happened. I seen Kevin clear as day. Nobody else ran into him, either.' Shuttered: Stewart ives in a 15,700 sq. ft. custom-built 6-bedroom, 12-bath log cabin compound outside Columbus, Indiana, the town in which he grew up. But sources say he has decamped 'with friends' Sheriff Philip Povero of Ontario County, which covers Canandaigua, said no criminal charges are pending against three-time NASCAR Sprint Cup champion Stewart, but investigations were continuing. He said Stewart had been cooperating with authorities, . Stewart, whose hot-headeness on the racetrack has brought him legions of both devoted fans and intractable foes, lives in a 15,700 sq. ft. custom-built 6-bedroom, 12-bath log cabin compound outside Columbus, Indiana, the town in which he grew up. The website of the company that built the house on Youth Camp Road says: 'From the minute one pulls up to the log home and parks under the porte cochére, they will notice the immense size of the home accented by a custom three tiered retaining wall constructed of large natural stone boulders to the west. A stream and pond tying into a fresh water fish aquarium will wrap around the great room to a two-story picture window with a view of Stewart's lake, all of which allow Stewart to enjoy his passion for nature year round. The lower level is designed to entertain guests through various eye catching amenities. As one descends down the curved log staircase encased by a natural rock wall, they will enter a large bar room with billiards, shuffle board, numerous televisions, and two racing display cases flanking an Indy car hung on the wall. On low key nights, Tony Stewart and his guests may prefer to watch a movie in the media room or play poker in the card room.' But Stewart — who has never married and has no children — is now staying far from the compound, which also includes a bowling alley and elevator. Cabin in the woods: This is a 'small' guest house on Tony's property. The main house is a 15,700 sq. ft.  custom-built log cabin with six bedrooms and 12 baths . He has still to decide whether to compete in this weekend's NASCAR event at the Michigan International Speedway. 'He will have as much time as he needs to make that decision,' said Arning. 'It is still an emotional time for all involved, Tony included. 'He is grieving and grief doesn't have a timetable.' Stewart's future could still be in doubt if his sponsors - including Mobil, Coca Cola and car dealership J.D. Byrider - decide to abandon him to keep their names away from controversy. All are monitoring the situation. 'Even if he’s cleared of any wrongdoing, it’s uncertain how many corporations would want a grinning Stewart pitching their products after this sort of tragedy,' Slate reports. Many racing fans are attacking him for his actions. On Stewart's own Facebook page, a man identifying himself as 'King Joe Shearer' wrote: 'Watch the video...you hear Stewart rev his engine...it looks like homicide.' Another fan, Lucian Hughes, added: That was no mistake, that was Tony being his usual bullheaded self and wasn't gone let some kid show him up and it cost Ward his life and Tony his career.' But he also got plenty of support. Kathy Neal wrote: 'Tony, please do not listen the negative people out there, You did nothing wrong, you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Get back in the car and race, put this behind you and move on.' And Patrick Moore added: Lesson is - Don't run around on a live track. It was unfortunate that the guy got so close to Tony and got hit but don't blame Tony for someone else's mistake.'","Following the crash that killed fellow NASCAR driving Kevin Ward Jr, beleaguered Tony Stewart has left his hometown of Columbus, Indiana .

"The pregnant 'body-in-suitcase' murder suspect Heather Mack told her lawyer 'I don't know how long I can take this' as it emerged she was put in solitary confinement in an Indonesian jail, her lawyer said on Monday. The 19-year-old's Chicago attorney told MailOnline he spoke to Mack for the first time in several days shortly after midnight today. 'She has gotten worse in terms of her emotional and mental state,' he said. 'On the one hand, the fact she is now in isolation with a female guard is healthy, but on the other she is very scared by what is going on. Sobbing: Heather Mack's lawyer raised concerns for Heather Mack's well-being as the pregnant teen is locked in solitary confinement over the grisly murder of her mother, Sheila von Wiese Mack . Brutal: Mrs von Wiese Mack's body was found stuffed in a suitcase at a luxury Bali resort (pictured with daughter, left). The teen and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer (right) were arrested on August 12 for the murder . 'She is emotionally and mentally drained, and told me, ""I don't know how long I can take this""'. I would like to be there because she needs a friendly face, somebody she can trust.' Heather and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, were arrested in Bali on August 12 for the murder of her mother, wealthy widow Sheila von Wiese Mack, 62. The butchered, half-naked body was discovered inside a suitcase that Heather and Schaefer had allegedly taken from the luxury St. Regis hotel down to a taxi, saying they would return. After two hours, the driver began to get suspicious when blood started to seep from the case and he went to the police station where the grisly discovery was made. The young lovers, who both come from the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, were arrested, asleep in each other's arms in a hotel near the Bali international airport, after allegedly attempting to get hotel staff to open her mother's safe deposit box so they could retrieve their passports. Heather is two months pregnant with what is believed to be Schaefer's child. Indonesian authorities say if she is convicted, the child could grow up in prison with her mother. Elkin said he has appointed a local Indonesian attorney to take the case and has aides on the island doing investigative work to help in her defence. Neither Heather nor Schaefer have yet been charged. He said he has scrapped immediate plans to go to Bali because sources on the ground there have told him that he could be detained himself because of allegations he made that Heather had been sexually assaulted while in prison. 'It was completely my intention to go,' he said. 'But when my sources started telling me the authorities had the intention of detaining me I changed my mind. It is not that I am concerned for my physical safety more the logistical issues that would arise if I was detained. 'It would create tremendous problems because I am the only one with full details of everything that is going on.' Last week Elkin made his claims that Heather had been sexually assaulted 'multiple times' inside her jail. He said she initially thought it was fellow inmates but later changed her mind saying not all the guards wear uniform. The lawyer admitted he had to be circumspect when asking her what had happened because of fears their conversation was being monitored. Problem child: Mrs von Wiese Mack's brother, William Wiese said that the girl went off the rails after the death of her father, Chicago composer James L Mack (above) in 2006. Pictures provided by Chicago Sun-Times . Fights: Police in Mack's hometown of Oak Park had been called to the family's former home 86 times over a ten-year period - an average of once every six weeks - to help calm fights between Mrs Mack and her daughter . 'I asked her if she was being mistreated and she said yes,' he told MailOnline at the time. 'I started going through questions and asked her if she had been touched inappropriately and she said yes. I asked her if it was in the female area and she said yes. I asked her if it was on more than one occasion and she said yes. 'I asked her if it was consensual and she said no. I could not go into the specifics of whether there was an actual rape or whether it was sexual assault, molesting, call it what you will. I cannot say for sure it was intercourse.' After those allegations Heather was placed on suicide watch and in solitary confinement with a regular female guard. Mrs Mack's body was found in the morning of August 12. She had been hit repeatedly about the face with a heavy blunt object. Pathologists say she suffered asphyxiation, a broken neck and a broken nose and that she had probably been killed between 6.45am and 10am local time. During her autopsy, several defensive wounds were also discovered — suggesting Mrs. Mack, the widow of Chicago musician James L. Mack, who died in front of Heather during a family vacation to Greece in 2006 — had fought back while being attacked. Dr Dudut Rustyadi, the forensic chief at Sanglah hospital morgue in the Balinese capital of Denpasar, said: 'From the wound, we found violence using blunt objects. 'We found many wounds, open wounds and bruises, including wounds on her left arm. We allege that the victim fought.' In the hours leading up to her murder, Mrs Mack had been seen on CCTV footage walking around the hotel lobby at 3.45am. Authorities say one sequence caught on hotel security cameras shows Mrs Mack arguing with her daughter and Schaefer about who should pay the hotel bill. She was heard by staff telling her daughter that she had paid for Schaefer’s air fare to Bali so the two of them should pay the bill. Police claim the young couple initially told them that they been taken captive at the St. Regis by an armed gang who killed Mrs Mack. They said they managed to escape the gang’s clutches and fled to the hotel in the Kuta area of Bali. Mrs. Mack's body was flown back to the United States last week. After the murder, police in her hometown of Oak Park revealed that they had been called to the family's former home 86 times over a ten-year period — an average of once every six weeks — to help calm fights between Mrs Mack and her daughter. Desperate: During Mrs von Wiese Mack's autopsy, several defensive wounds were also discovered — suggesting had fought back while being attacked . Argument: Police allege one sequence caught on hotel security cameras shows Mrs Mack arguing with her daughter and Schaefer (above) about who should pay the hotel bill . They never made an arrest in all of those visits even though Mrs Mack was found with a broken arm on one occasion in 2011. It was also revealed that Mrs Mack called cops just last month after her credit card company told her about an unauthorized charge. Police went to the Conrad Hotel in downtown Chicago, where they found Tommy, Heather and seven other youngsters partying in an eighth-floor suite. Schaefer was arrested and was due to appear in court in September on charges related to the incident. Mrs. Mack's brother, William Wiese told the Chicago Tribune that Heather grew more difficult after her father's death, which the family alleged resulted from an injury he suffered on an earlier cruise in 2006. Mrs. Mack won a $1.5 million settlement from Royal Caribbean Cruises. Wiese told the Tribune he believed Schaefer showed up in Bali without his sister's knowledge as she was trying to make a fresh start with her daughter by taking her on the vacation. 'She was such an optimist,' he said. 'She was forever trying to help that girl.' 'I think my sister loved Heather more than anything,' Wiese added. 'She would seek our input and advice. She tried so hard to help Heather through the years with therapists and psychiatrists. It was always a struggle to get Heather to (cooperate).' Mrs Mack sold the five-bed, five-bath Oak Park mansion to a developer for $650,000 last year. After extensive renovations it is now back on the market for $1.68 million. At the time of her death, she and her daughter were living in a 18th-floor luxury apartment on Chicago's Gold Coast area with stunning views overlooking Lake Michigan.","Heather Mack's lawyer reveals the desperate midnight phone call .

"The heroic doctor who stopped a psychiatric patient's deadly rampage at a Philadelphia hospital last week has been pictured for the first time as he heals from his wounds at home. Dr Lee Silverman used his own gun to shoot down patient Richard Plotts who snapped and shot dead his mental health caseworker Theresa Hunt during a session last Thursday. But an armed Dr Silverman stopped Plotts before he could take another victim, by using his own gun to injure the 49-year-old mental patient. Dr Silverman was injured in the shootout but has since been released from the hospital. In pictures posted to Facebook, Silverman is shown wearing a bandage on his head and hand.

Proud: Dr Silverman's young daughter draw this picture of to honor her heroic dad . Injured: This screen grab shows Dr Silverman being rushed into an ambulance after the Thursday altercation at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital . The hospital horror unfolded on Thursday afternoon when patient Plotts arrived at the Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital with Hunt where they met Dr Silverman in an office at the psychiatric unit on the third floor of the hospital. Once inside, the calamitious series of events began with a heated argument that ended with Hunt being fatally shot in the head, Dr Silverman also suffering a hit to the head and Plotts critically wounded after two gunshot wounds to the torso and one to his arm. It was Dr. Silverman's quick reaction that saved lives and police have hailed him as a hero for stopping Plotts before he could embark on a gun rampage. Yeadon Police Chief Donald Molineux said that 'without a doubt, I believe the doctor saved lives.' 'Without . that firearm, this guy (the patient) could have went out in the hallway . and just walked down the offices until he ran out of ammunition,' the . chief said.

Whelan identified the caseworker killed Thursday afternoon at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital as Theresa Hunt, 53. Hunt, who was from Philadelphia, had accompanied Plotts to an appointment with Silverman at a psychiatric crisis center adjacent to the hospital in Darby, just southwest of Philadelphia, authorities said. 'When the caseworker was shot, (Silverman) crouched down behind the desk to avoid him being shot,' Whelan said.

A struggle ensued and spilled out into the hallway, Whelan said. Another doctor and a caseworker jumped in to help Silverman and secure Plotts' weapon, he said. The motive for the shooting remained unclear late Thursday, although Whelan said Plotts, of Upper Darby, might have had issues with the doctor over his treatment plan. However, it's unclear if that's why Silverman was armed, apparently against hospital policy. 'We do believe that there were some issues between the doctor and the patient, but whether or not he actually feared him is unclear,' the prosecutor said. 'From all accounts, (he) would have acted in self-defense.' As of Sunday, Plotts, 49, was still in fair condition at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, while Silverman had been treated and released. Telephone calls to the doctor's home went unanswered. Fatal shooting: Several victims were reported after shots were fired at the Darby Borough hospital and at least one victim has died . Suspect: Shots broke out around 2pm but by 3pm reports from the scene indicated the suspected shooter was in custody . Swarm: Shots rang out at the Delaware County facility around 2pm and SWAT teams quickly descended on the building . Plotts does not have a listed home phone number. Court records in Delaware County show a man of the same name and age with a lengthy criminal record, but Whelan was uncertain if they were the same person. The hospital has a policy barring anyone except on-duty law enforcement officers from carrying weapons on its campus, a spokeswoman for the Mercy Health System said. But Molineux insisted Silverman was a hero who saved lives. Two guns were recovered from the scene, Whelan said. Staff members had heard loud arguing inside Silverman's office during the appointment. They opened the door and noticed the patient had a gun pointed at the doctor, so they quietly closed the door and dialed 911, Whelan said. Gunshots were heard a short time later, just before 2:30 p.m. Terrifying: Around 100 terrified people ran out of the hospital's wellness center as SWAT teams rushed in . About 100 people were evacuated. The shooting reportedly occurred on a third floor psych ward . Plotts, severely wounded from several shots, emerged from the office, and another doctor and a caseworker helped wrestle him to the floor of the hallway and grabbed his weapon, Whelan said. 'They acted vigilantly. They acted bravely,' he said. The exchange of gunfire occurred on the third floor of the Wellness Center at Mercy Fitzgerald, a 204-bed community teaching hospital. Authorities said there are no surveillance cameras in the doctor's office or the waiting area outside. They also said the center had no metal detectors. Patients waiting in the first-floor lobby reported a tense scene when police arrived and ordered everyone out. Most of the patients were elderly. 'I dozed off, and I heard the cop shouting, ""Come on, come on, get out!""' said Millicent Russell, of Lansdowne, who was waiting for a 3 p.m. appointment. 'There were people with walkers and canes and stuff. All these cops were outside running here and there with these guns.' The distraught family of . Hunt have vented their . fury at her killer online. Her . sister, Martha Trinca, took to Facebook to label Richard Plotts -  who . was critically wounded by hero Dr. Lee Silverman when he returned fire - . a 'SOB' who 'needs to rot in hell forever'. Anger: This is the message that Theresa Hunts sister, Martha Trinca, posted to Facebook on Saturday expressing her rage at her sister's killer . Tears: Dennis Hunt fought back his emotions as he tried to explain how he will feel and cope with the loss of his sister, Theresa, who was shot dead in Philadelphia on Thursday . The . caseworker's devastated brother, Dennis Hunt, said that he was 'angry' at Plotts, 49, for taking Theresa's life, telling reporters that the . youngest of nine children was known by her siblings as 'Mother Theresa' for her compassion. Writing . on Facebook about her awful loss, Martha Trinca said that her sister . was her 'best friend' and 'I'm glad I told her every time we talked how . much I love her!! I will cherish our time together for the rest of my . life!!' Her clearly emotional brother, Dennis, struggled to get through his interview with ABC 6 and said he wants to ask Plotts why he kiled his little sister. 'I . want people to remember my sister as someone who was strong and stands . up for what she believes in and good hearted... I don't know what to . say,' said Dennis to ABC 6. 'I think that doctor who actually was armed, I think was incredible, what he did.'","Dr Lee Silverman shot his patient Richard Plotts on Thursday, after the man went on a rampage and killed his mental caseworker Theresa Hunt, 53 .

"More than half of teenagers and people in their early 20s say they have been victims of some form of online bullying, taunts or harassment. An MTV poll has discovered that 56 per cent have been targeted through various methods including a third who have fallen foul of 'sexting' - the sharing of risqué personal videos or images. As many as 40 per cent have even faced some form of abuse from their partners on computers or with mobile phones. Harassment: As young people spend more time on the internet, the number that report being bullied continues to rise . With more time being spent on the internet, there has been a significant increase in online bullying of 14 to 24-year-olds - a rise of 10 per cent in just two years. In some of the most tragic cases, vicious taunts have led to suicides. Yesterday New York Senator Jeffrey Klein introduced a new 'cyber-bullying' bill saying outdated pre-digital harassment laws fail to punish bullies who use the internet and mobile phones to torment others. Tragic: Jamey Rodemeyer, 14, killed himself after falling victim to online bullies. A poll found 56 per cent of American youth had been taunted online . He argued that current state law had failed to keep up with modern technology and people spending more time online. 'If people know there is a tough law on the books and they're going to be punished, they are going to act accordingly,' he said. At least 30 states have laws dealing with online harassment and five specifically for cyber-bullying. Mr Klein's bill would mean that stalking laws would be updated to include harassing a child using electronic communication. Although it is already a crime to . 'intentionally cause or aid' another person's suicide, the bill would . update the state's second-degree manslaughter statute to explicitly . include cyber-bullying as a possible cause of such a suicide. At the weekend, Lady Gaga sang a tribute to 14-year-old Jamey Rodemeyer who apparently killed himself after sending her a thank-you message on Twitter. He had suffered from homophobic online bullying for more than a year and wrote a blog about trouble he got at school. Among the anonymous posting was one that said 'JAMIE IS STUPID, GAY FAT ANND UGLY. HE MUST DIE!' Proportion of people who say they have been bullied online: 56% . Rise since 2009: 10% . Number who say the internet is a shield for bullies: 75% . Those aged 14-17 who have 'sexted': 8% . Those aged 18-24 who have sexted: 14% . Proportion who have been abused online by partner: 14%AP-MTV poll of 1,355 people aged 14-24 . Police have launched an investigation to decide whether to bring charges and believe that three fellow students may have been involved. While many forms of online bullying decline as teens go through school, homophobic abuse remains the same throughout. Catherine Devine, 22, said that she . became a victim of internet harassment when she was 12 and in 7th grade before she had even ventured onto the internet. Somebody . opened a screen name with the name 'devinegirl' and started sending . rumours and lies about her to classmates. When she was 15 one . 'friend' sent her diary to other people. When she was 18 she sent a revealing . picture of herself to her boyfriend after he put pressure on her. However, . when they broke up he threatened to use it to embarrass her. 'I . didn't realise the power he could have over me from that,' she said. 'I . thought he'd just see it once and then delete it, like I had deleted . it.' Three-quarters of . young people believe that bullies use the internet because they . are too cowardly to confront their victim face to face. False . rumours and sharing other people's private messages are among the more . common forms of bullying while logging onto someone else's account and . spying on them are also popular. Nearly . a fifth of young people said that someone else had posted embarrassing . pictures or video of them online without their permission. Risque: The number of incidents of 'sexting' - sending lewd images - has not increased thanks to high profile cases like that of former congressman, Anthony Weiner . Researchers have found that many of those who bully on the internet do the same in real life. Sameer . Hinduja, from Florida Atlantic University, said: 'We are seeing . offenders who are just jerks to people online and offline. 'When . I was bullied in middle school I could go home and slam my door and . forget about it for a while. These kids can be accessed around the clock . through technology. There's really no escape.' Despite . the significant rises in other forms of bullying, sexting has shown . little increase. It is believed that this is because people are thinking . twice about sending photographs of themselves. A major deterrent has been high-profile cases including that of former Senator Anthony Wiener who stood down from Congress after posting a risqué picture of himself on Twitter. Eight . per cent of those aged 14 to 17 said they had shared a naked picture of . themselves; among 18 to 24 years old, it was 14 per cent. But almost a quarter of the younger group said they'd been exposed to sexting in . some way, including seeing images someone else was showing around. And . 37 per cent of the young adults had some experience with 'sexting' images. Many young people don't take sexting seriously, despite the potential consequences. Alec Wilhelmi, 20, says girlfriends and girls who like him have sent sexual messages or pictures - usually photos of bare body parts that avoid showing faces. Once a friend made a sexual video with his girlfriend, and showed Mr Wilhelmi on his mobile. 'I thought that was funny, because I don't know what kind of girl would allow that,' said Mr Wilhelmi, a freshman at Iowa State University. Technology can facilitate dating abuse. Nearly three in 10 young people say their partner has checked up on them electronically multiple times a day or read their text messages without permission. Fourteen per cent say they've experienced more abusive behaviour from their partners, such as name-calling and mean messages, via Internet or cellphone. The poll is part of an MTV campaign, 'A Thin Line,' aiming to stop the spread of digital abuse.","MTV poll finds that 56% of those aged 14 to 24 have been bullied on the internet .

"The U.S. Army solider who used his helmet camera filmed a shocking firefight with the Taliban has finally been revealed - and he says he never meant for the footage to go public. Private First Class Ted Daniels, 37, says he can no longer watch the video, which has been viewed on YouTube 23million times, because it is too painful to watch. It also got him in trouble with his commanders, who called the dramatic cries for help after he was wounded served as a propaganda victory for the Taliban in Afghanistan. Scroll down for video . Injured: Private First Class Ted Daniels, 37, says his helmet cam video got him into trouble with his commanders. He is currently recovering from injuries at Fort Carson, Colorado . Courage under fire: The soldier's helmet cam is running as he and his unit come under heavy fire in Afghanistan . Too close for comfort: Dust kicked up by a bullet can be seen on the video, right near the soldier's feet as he descends the mountain . Pfc Daniels spoke to the Washington Post for the first time since the video went public in September and became an international sensation. The three and a half minute video captures Pfc Daniels' peril as gunshots can be seen and heard all around him. He fires several shots as he descends a mountain in an effort to draw fire away from his comrades. As he makes his way down, bullets can . be seen ricocheting by his feet - some coming dangerously close as he . scrambles behind a rock for safety. But as he crouches, the soldier drops his gun as a ricochet strikes his hand. 'I'm hit!' the soldier can be heard yelling repeatedly. 'Help me!' Taking cover: The soldier can be seen trying to duck behind a rock as shots ring out close to him . His cries are not answered as shots continue to be heard. In an interview with the Post, Pfc Daniels admitted that drawing himself into the open might not have been the smartest move. 'It wasn’t the most tactically brilliant thing to do,' he said. Eventually, even though he was struck by shrapnel four times, he was able to climb back to the cover of a nearby armored vehicle. Pfc Daniels said he never intended to publish the video for millions to see - he was online hoping to archive in a private YouTube account. When he set the video to upload, the video hosting service estimated it would take one hour to process the raw footage and put it online. So he left for five hours. In deep: As he screamed for help, shots continued to be fired in the direction of the injured soldier . When he returned, he had a message from YouTube user Funker530 waiting for him. The user, who has a channel that specializes in raw footage of combat, asked Pfc Daniels if he could use the video. Two days later, after the clip been seen by hundreds of thousands of people around the world and been broadcast on CNN and the other major networks, his sergeant called him and demanded the video be taken down. Military brass feared the the video - with Pfc Daniels' cries for help - could be used as propaganda by the Taliban. He contacted Funker530 and asked him to remove the video. The user never got back to him. The Washington Post reports that a video like Daniels' and all the traffic and subscribers it drew - could be worth $150,000 in ad revenue sharing for Funker30 . Pfc Daniels said that he was part of a team on a reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering mission when they encountered the Taliban fighters. He said: ‘I got a hit a total of 4 . times. My helmet cam died and i made it down the mountain on my own. I . was also hit in the side of my helmet and my eye pro was shot off of my . face.' Desperate: At one point in the video, his gun was knocked out of his hands by the force of one of the shots . Down, but not out: The soldier survived the assault after he said he was shot four times, but was not seriously injured . 'The rest of the squad was pinned down by machine gun fire. I didn't start the video until a few minutes into the firefight for obvious reasons. 'I came out into the open to draw fire so my squad could get to safety.' He said that one of the shots 'struck the tube by my hand of the 203 grenade launcher which knocked it out of my hands.' 'When I picked the rifle back up it was still functional but the grenade launcher tube had a nice sized 7.62 cal bullet hole in it and was rendered useless.' The video was uploaded by YouTube user Funker530, which promises even more never-before-seen footage from the front lines of Afghanistan. This footage is part of an ongoing project documenting of the war in Afghanistan.","Pfc Ted Daniels, 37, shot at as he tried to draw fire away from members of his unit .

"The nine-year-old girl who tragically killed an instructor in an accident at a US shooting range lived in Australia until 2013, Daily Mail Australia can reveal. The young girl lived and attended school in the Sydney suburb of Mosman until July last year, with her father, investment banker Alex Gen MacLachlan, her mother Alison and her older brother and sister. It is also understood that his daughter was born in Australia before the family returned to the United States last year. Mr MacLachlan works for the US arm of Dixon Advisory, which is based in Sydney. He is an Ivy League-educated banker who manages a fund worth $1.5bn, who relocated his family to the US for his work. He and his wife Alison have made no public comment on the tragedy beyond speaking through their lawyer, to say that they are 'devastated' by the accident at the Arizona firing range which killed instructor Charles Vacca. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Alex MacLachlan, (left, pictured with his sister, Elizabeth) fired the gun first before letting his daughter take hold of the Uzi. MacLachlan is a fund manager with a firm in New Jersey and oversees $1.5bn . 'All right, full auto': MacLachlan's wife, Alison, filmed the moment their daughter shot dead instructor Charles Vacca and handed it over to police. The family said in a statement that they were praying for Vacca's family . A former neighbour told Daily Mail Australia that the girl's mother, Alison MacLachlan is Australian, and still has family still living in Mrs MacLachlan's hometown Newcastle in New South Wales. Neighbours at the upscale Sydney suburb where they lived described them as a 'gorgeous, happy family', adding the couple had two other children, an older boy and a girl of high school age. The girl involved in the accident attended a local Mosman primary school, Middle Harbour Public School, according to the neighbour. 'They are an absolutely gorgeous family, but just an ordinary family. It must have been absolutely frightful. It's absolutely shocking,' they told Daily Mail Australia. Mrs MacLachlan is believed to have been a stay-at-home mother whilst living in Australia and was very involved in the children's schools and the local community, including work with Sydney Wildlife. 'They were such a happy family and such great neighbours, so involved with everything they did. I was so sorry to see them leave,' their former neighbour told Daily Mail Australia. Past: The Maclachlans moved from this luxurious house in an upscale suburb of Sydney last year as Alex had spent a large portion of his career there. Neighbours said they were a 'happy, gorgeous' family . A female relative of MacLachlan living in New Jersey confirmed to MailOnline that Alex's daughter had been involved in the shooting. 'But I can't say anything about it,' she added. 'It's just terrible.' He has not returned to work at Dixon's Global Resource Masters Fund since the August 25 accident. The family hasn't yet returned to their home in Weehawken, New Jersey just across the Hudson River from New York City either. A neighbour on the busy street where the MacLachlans live described the family as 'quiet and very nice,' adding 'it's all so terrible. That girl's just a baby.' MacLachlan, 43, is a high-flyer in the financial world. After graduating from Cornell University and getting a masters at Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, he spent most of his career in Australia where he also worked for UBS. MacLachlan has hired lawyer Kevin Walsh - who has been named as one of the 'Best Lawyers in America' since 2012 - to represent him. Walsh, a former federal prosecutor, did not return MailOnline's repeated calls. He earlier issued a statement saying the MacLachlan family was 'devastated', by the death of Vacca, 39, saying family members 'prayed day and night' that he would 'survive his injury'. Walsh said the MacLachlans 'continue to pray' for Vacca's family 'during this terribly difficult time'. Alex and Alison MacLachlan and their three children were vacationing in Las Vegas and took a 60-mile shuttle across the Arizona border to the Last Stop resort in White Hills for some weapon practice on August 25. They went for an early morning monster truck ride before going to Last Stop's Burgers and Bullets shooting range. According to Mohave County Sheriff's Department, Alex was first to fire the Mini Uzi 9mm before allowing his little girl to have a go. Video shows Vacca telling the pony-tailed girl, who was wearing a gray t-shirt, pink shorts and sneakers, how to shoot the gun. High flier: MacLachlan's profile on his firm's page. He graduated from Cornell University and got a Masters degree from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania . The video, taken by the girl's mother on a mobile phone and released by the sheriff's department, shows the instructor, wearing sunglasses, a black t-shirt, camouflage pants and dark gloves, tapping the back of the girl's left knee to put her into a correct shooting stance. He then let her fire one shot as he braced her right elbow with his gloved right hand and placed his left hand in the small of her back. Vacca then turned the weapon on to automatic fire and that is when things went tragically wrong. He then says 'all right, full auto' and the video shows the slightly-built pre-teen lose control of the weapon which curls upward and to her left where her instructor is standing. The video cuts out before the shot to the head that kills Vacca. The girl's parents did not initially realise what had happened as they rushed to their daughter, who had dropped the gun complaining that the recoil had hurt her shoulder. Range workers went to the aid of Vacca, but nothing could be done to save him. A 911 call timed at 10.02 am recorded a fellow worker urging him: 'Breathe, breathe, breathe, Charlie. Breathe.' While another says 'I don't think he's gonna make it.' A 911 dispatcher asks a caller: 'Is he breathing?' The desperate man replies: 'Yes he is, he's having convulsions. You need to send EMS right away.' In a second 911 call a few minutes later, a man at the range asks the dispatcher: 'Where the f..k is the helicopter?' Vacca was eventually stabilised at the scene and airlifted by helicopter to University Medical Center in Las Vegas where he was pronounced dead soon after arrival. Authorities are not pressing charges in the death. According to police reports, Alex and Alison MacLachlan refused to allow investigators to interview their children because they were 'going through a lot'. Police at the scene were instructed to collect the waivers signed by the parents allowing the girl to shoot the Uzi but were told by range staff that they had 'blown away' after the shooting. The MacLachlans have not said whether they are considering a civil suit against the shooting range owners. Alex MacLachlan works for the US arm of Dixon Advisory, based in Sydney, Australia. His 10th floor office in Jersey City, New Jersey, has sweeping views of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty across the Hudson River. Desperate: A 911 call recorded Vacca's  fellow worker urging him: 'Breathe, breathe, breathe, Charlie. Breathe' Investigation: Alex and Alison MacLachlan refused to allow investigators to interview their children because they were 'going through a lot', according to police reports . 'Alex conceived the idea of establishing a business to acquire and manage homes in urban areas experiencing strong growth and gentrification in 2008,' according to the website of his employers, Dixon USA. 'Between 2008 and 2010, Alex researched and developed the investment thesis and business model for what would become Dixon USA, and in late 2010, Dixon USA was launched. Today, Dixon USA manages a portfolio of over $300 million and is the only real estate investment trust focused on New York metropolitan area single-family homes.' A woman who answered the phone on Wednesday said MacLachlan had not been at work all week but referred other questions to MacLachlan's assistant, who refused to comment. According to the company's website, 'from funds under management of under $100 million at the time of his start, Alex has grown the Funds Management division to over $1.5 billion of funds under management today.' The Dixon website adds: 'In addition to his role as CEO of Funds Management, he now also leads the strategy and growth of Dixon USA, a leading provider of urban single-family home rentals in the New York metropolitan area. 'During his tenure in investment banking, Alex worked on more than $100 billion in mergers and acquisitions and capital markets transactions, advising some of the world’s leading companies,' the Dixon website says.","Daily Mail Australia can reveal that the young girl involved in the tragic US shooting range accident lived in Australia until 2013 .

'He has been in and out of trouble for 20 years and if he hasn't been rehabbed by now he never will be. I hope he never gets out of prison — we will all be in trouble if he does.

Shock: Theresa Hunt was shot dead by Richard Plotts in a Philadelphia hospital on Thursday after an argument broke out and a gun battle ensued . Authorities say Plotts, 49, had been ranting about the hospital's no-gun policy when he pulled out his weapon. Police found 39 unused rounds on Plotts and seized two more revolvers and a computer when they searched his home in Upper Derby, Pennsylvania. Silverman, who has been hailed as a hero for his actions, crouched behind his desk, took out his own handgun and returned fire. The hospital is unlikely to take action against Silverman for having the gun on the premises and says it will welcome him back to work. Kimberly, 49, says she was shocked but not surprised to hear that the man she was married to for more than a decade had finally killed someone. 'He was always threatening and he said that one day he would kill me — and I knew it was always possible,"" she said. 'He is a very violent person.' Plotts and . Kimberly met in high school.

She soon realized she had to get out of the marriage, but every time she asked for a divorce he threw up roadblocks. It was only when he was sentenced to jail for a bank robbery in the mid 1990s that she managed to end the marriage officially. 'When the judge sentenced him to 80 months in jail it was a huge weight lifted from my shoulders. I knew that for 80 months I wouldn't have to be looking over my shoulder all the time, wondering if he was following me.'

Kimberly's fears that she could have been her ex'x victim rather than his caseworker appear well-founded. T . The Delaware County Daily Times newspaper quoted an 'acquaintance' of Plotts as saying : 'I would say that he threatened me many times. I felt like I was going to get shot. He would threaten his caseworkers because he didn’t want to keep (doctor) appointments. 'And a couple times, he told me that he would have liked to shoot his ex-wife.' The paper also reported that detectives are being asked to re-open an old sudden death case to see if Plotts was involved.

"Children who are obese are up to six times more at risk of high blood pressure – an adult condition commonly linked to heart disease, warn specialists. Young obese girls have the biggest problem, with a 5.9-fold chance of developing it compared with those of healthy weight, while the risk is four times greater for obese boys. The study from Germany also shows that children and teenagers who are overweight are more likely to have high blood pressure readings. The study from Germany also shows that children and teenagers who are overweight are more likely to have high blood pressure readings (File photos) Experts say the findings are ‘alarming’, given that one in three children is overweight and obese by the time they leave primary school in the UK. They come as doctors called for the creation of an emergency taskforce to tackle ‘the rising epidemic’ of childhood obesity, similar to the Government’s Cobra panel which deals with terrorism and national disasters. The professional body representing GPs has warned that an entire generation will be ‘destroyed’ by a diet of junk food and sugary drinks unless urgent action is taken. In an open letter to the Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Dame Sally Davies, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and 11 linked organisations said a national Child Obesity Action Group (COAG) should be formed as ‘a matter of urgency’. Doctors, nurses, midwives, dieticians, dentists and schools would collaborate to try to prevent obesity and improve treatment services to stop children developing health problems in later life. Dr Richard Roope, RCGP clinical lead for cancer, said: ‘For the first time, we have a generation of patients who may predecease their parents. Only three per cent of the public associate weight with cancer, yet, after smoking, obesity is the biggest reversible factor in cancers.’ Stark evidence of the link between body fat and ill-health, even in young children, was released yesterday (sun) by researchers running a Family Heart Study in Nuremberg, Germany. It included 22,051 children and adolescents aged three to 18 years from ‘health-conscious’ families whose blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and body fat percentage was measured. They found that compared with normal weight children and adolescents, the risk of prehypertension (which precedes a condition needing medical treatment) was significantly higher in youngsters with high BMI scores. The prevalence of high blood pressure increased in boys and girls as body weight went up, based on averages among the groups at the age of seven years and again at 14 years. Hypertension in normal weight boys was 5.7 per cent, rising to 10.4 per cent for the overweight and 18.6 per cent in obese boys. The researchers found the prevalence of hypertension was highest in obese girls at 24.4 per cent, and 9 per cent in . the overweight compared with five per cent in those of normal weight. Prof Schwandt said ‘The risk of having hypertension is 5.9 time higher for an obese girls and 4.3 times higher for an obese boy than for normal-weight young people.’ He released the data yesterday (sun) at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) meeting in Barcelona. Hypertension was a blood pressure reading over the 95th percentile of the blood pressure curve for children and adolescents. The diagnosis was based on several measurements on separate days and on repeated estimations with the child sitting quietly for five minutes. Professor Empar Lurbe, professor of paediatrics at the University of Valencia, Spain, told the meeting: ‘Blood pressure in children increases with age and body size. ‘This makes it impossible to use a single blood pressure level to define hypertension, as we do in adults.’ Professor Schwandt said ‘Our study clearly shows that the fatter young people are, the greater their risk of prehypertension and hypertension. Any weight loss they can achieve will help reduce their risk. ‘This is of great importance because of the ongoing rise in the prevalence of hypertension and overweight/obesity in young people and the tracking of childhood overweight into adulthood.’ Tam Fry, from the UK’s National Obesity Forum, said ‘It’s alarming. This demonstrates that obesity is no longer a timebomb; it is a crisis which is escalating every day. ‘We need to stop children getting fat in the first place, because fat children become fat adults and as this study shows, even before then they are suffering from major health risks. ‘When it comes to high blood pressure, which vastly increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes, it is likely that the foods being eaten by obese children are not helping; crisps piled high in salt, and so forth. ‘This has to be wake-up call. We are looking at a situation in which children are buried before their parents, the obesity crisis in Britain is horrifying.’ Professor Pedro Marques-Vidal, head of the ESC’s preventive health group, said doctors were ‘definitely not’ advocating that blood pressure drugs be given to children. He said there was evidence that losing weight could reverse high blood pressure and it was vital that parents and schools worked together to combat the problem.","Body representing GPs warns an entire generation will be ‘destroyed’ by junk food and sugary drinks .

"Sen John McCain returns to public after an operation for skin cancer . Older men are at the fastest growing risk of the most deadly form of skin cancer, claim doctors. Cases of melanoma have increased by 12 per cent every year in men aged 60 and over during the last two decades, according to official figures. Older women have the next highest rate of increase, prompting experts to warn that awareness campaigns have been too focused on targeting the young on social media. Malignant melanoma is now the fifth most common cancer, affecting more than 13,000 Britons annually and killing 2,000 patients a year. Experts blame the explosion in package holidays by sun-seekers starting in the 1960s, as well as young people spending more time than ever before in pursuit of a tan that often leads to cancer-causing sunburn. Health awareness campaigns using social media have targeted young people – melanoma is the most common cancer in women in their 20s. This means that older people may be missing vital information on the signs and symptoms of the disease, as it is not produced in formats that they would normally see. A study shows skin cancer rates in England are rising faster in older men than any other age group, according to a study being presented next week at the World Congress on Cancers of the Skin in Edinburgh. Conducted by analysts at Public Health England, the research found the most common type of skin cancer – called superficial spreading melanoma – increased by 12 per cent per year over a 21-year period (1990 to 2010) for men aged 60 and over. This was followed by a nine per cent increase for older women and eight per cent in younger men. Skin cancer: An older woman checks the mole on her body. Cases of melanoma have increased by 12 per cent  in men aged 60 and older women have the next highest rate of increase (File photos) The study also found thicker, more advanced tumours in older men are increasing at a greater rate – around 12 per cent a year compared with just six per cent in younger men. This suggests older men may be delaying seeking medical advice. Melanoma is more common in men on the back, where it is difficult to spot early changes in a mole. Experts believe the rapidly rising rate in older people is partly because it is difficult to distinguish skin cancer from other harmless ailments, such as warts, that commonly develop in later life. Older men also have the fastest rise in melanomas diagnosed on the trunk and upper limbs, at around a nine per cent increase per year. The findings are mirrored by an earlier study into skin cancer in the Scottish population. It showed rates of melanoma trebling in men between 1979 and 2003 – with the greatest increases in those aged 60 and over. Johnathon Major of the British Association of Dermatologists said: ‘Older men have continuously proved a problematic group for us to target with skin cancer advice and studies such as these underline the requirement to reach them. Health awareness campaigns using social media have targeted young people – melanoma is the most common cancer in women in their 20s (File photo) ‘We are constantly developing our communication initiatives to tender to wider audiences and target groups such as these who have been demonstrated to be in particular need. ‘With health messaging, there can be an over-reliance on newer technologies such as social media, but these don’t always reach the groups most in need. ‘There are two issues at play here – skin cancer rates are rising faster in this group, so we conclude that protecting the skin from sun damage is important for adult men as well as others, and second, there is concern that older men also seem to be presenting later. ‘This shows we need to address both our prevention messages, and our early detection messages, at older people as a matter of priority.’ Julia Verne, Director of the South West Knowledge and Intelligence Team, Public Health England, said: ‘The findings of this study highlight the need for education campaigns to target the entire spectrum of people across all demographics about the dangers of sunburn and sunbathing.’","Malignant melanoma is now the fifth most common cancer .

"Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea insists he is happy at Old Trafford despite being tracked by Real Madrid. The 23-year-old, who moved from Atletico Madrid to United in a £17.8million deal in 2011, has been tipped to replace Real and Spain keeper Iker Casillas for club and country. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti was quick to dispel talk of a move, claiming they are happy with the keepers they have, but there is a clamour among supporters and board members to bring in De Gea, who has two years left on his United contract. Manchester United's David de Gea insists he is happy at Old Trafford despite being tracked by Real Madrid . The former Atletico Madrid man has impressed this season and caught the eye of the European champions . United will have a big say in that though, as they inch towards agreeing a new long-term contract with De Gea. They have been encouraged further by the player's reassurance that he is content at the club. Talking to German magazine Kicker, De Gea said: '[They are] Just rumours. I'm happy here.' United, who are sixth in the Barclays Premier League, have yet to hit form under Louis van Gaal, and De Gea added: 'Starting problems are quite normal under a new coach with a completely new concept. Real Madrid see De Gea as the  successor to Iker Casillas (centre), whose stock has fallen in recent years . Manchester United's keeper is also seen as a suitable replacement for Casillas in the Spain national team . 'That's a process and Van Gaal always says that we will improve, but it takes time. But without a doubt, United have to reach the Champions League again.' De Gea also praised Sir Alex Ferguson for protecting him during his early career at United. 'It was a difficult time but Sir Alex always backed me. He saved me from criticism and was patient until I was ripe for United. Today I'm thankful for that [the criticism]. That made me stronger. Goalkeeper is a tricky position. Mistakes are human. It's about being up to that. If you make mistakes you will have to improve. Now I'm better.'","David de Gea is reportedly being tracked by Real Madrid .

"Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin and her family have been accused of starting a drunken brawl involving more than a dozen people this weekend. Police are investigating a fight in South Anchorage, Alaska, which is said to have taken place at a birthday party for Sarah's husband Todd. According to witnesses the former Governor of Alaska's three oldest children were all involved in the fighting, and Todd Palin walked away with a bloody nose. Palin punch-up: Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin  and several members of her family were allegedly involved in a drunken fight at a party in Anchorage, Alaska . The fight involved 'roughly 20 people' and alcohol is believed to have been a factor in the incident, which took place around 11pm on Saturday night, The Anchorage Police Department said. Several local sources reported on the incident, initially scooped by Alaska political blogger Amanda Coyne. According to witnesses the party had been held to celebrate several birthdays of former participants in the Iron Dog snowmobile race, including Todd Palin. Several members of the Palin family, having arrived in a stretch Hummer limousine, allegedly stepped in when it was discovered that an former boyfriend of middle-daughter Willow, 20, was at the party. Oldest son Track, 25, is said to have ripped his shirt off while making rude gestures to the young man, while his sister, and Dancing With The Stars alumni, Bristol, 23, attacked the host. Family fun: The Palins, pictured in 2007, were all said to have been involved in the fight, which kicked off over an ex-boyfriend of Willow, second from left, and saw son Track, left, rip off his shirt, Bristol, far right, punch the host and Sarah's husband Todd, second right, leave with a bloody nose . Former First Family: The former Republican vice presidential candidate is said to have shouted 'don't you know who I am?!' 'The owner of the house gets involved, and he probably wished he hadn’t. At this point, he’s up against nearly the whole Palin tribe: Palin women screaming. Palin men thumping their chests,' Amanda Coyne wrote. 'Word is that Bristol has a particularly strong right hook, which she employed repeatedly, and it’s something to hear when Sarah screams, “Don’t you know who I am!” ' 'As people were leaving in a cab, Track was seen on the street, shirtless, flipping people off, with Sarah right behind him, and Todd somewhere in the foreground, tending to his bloody nose.' Anchorage police were called to the scene just before midnight, but no arrests were made. ‘Anchorage police responded to a report of a verbal and physical altercation taking place between multiple subjects outside of a residence,’ police spokesperson Jennifer Castro told Alaska Dispatch News. ‘A preliminary investigation by police revealed that a party had been taking place at a nearby residence and a fight had broken out between multiple subjects outside of the residence. ‘At the time of the incident, none of the involved parties wanted to press charges and no arrests were made. ‘Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party.’ Although none of the parties wanted to press charges at the time of the incident, police confirmed that the case is still an active investigation and is being reviewed by APD and the Municipal Prosecutors Office.

"A weekend fight involving nearly every member of the Palin family was actually started by the infamous politician and her brood, this according to numerous eyewitnesses. The Palin pack apparently had a run-in with Connor Cleary, an ex-boyfriend of Willow, 20, at a birthday party on Saturday evening, and that was when all hell broke loose. According to multiple witnesses at the party, oldest Palin son Track, 25, traded blows with his sister's ex on the front lawn of the party, and when Cleary's father Steve tried to break the boys up, Todd Palin began to choke him. Todd ended up walking away with a bloody nose. Scroll down for video .

Then, Sarah, 50, tried to get involved. Birthday boy: The Palin family was celebrating the birthday of family friend Marc McKenna . A source said  the failed vice-presidential candidate was 'nearly crawling on top of people' to get involved in the fight. The party, meanwhile, was not for Todd, who did turn 50 on Saturday, but rather for twins Matt and Marc McKenna, who are close friends of the Palin family. Once the fight finally broke up, Willow and big sister Bristol, 23, who apparently spent the entire evening wearing sunglasses as they strolled around the party, tried to start things up all over again, by going after Conner's mother, Melissa. 'They were on a b-line, coming straight at Melissa,' said partygoer Eric Thompson. They were stopped by the host of the party however, Korey Klingenmeyer, who politely asked them to leave. So Bristol started punching him in the face. Repeatedly. Thompson told political blogger Amanda Coyne Bristol 'stood straight up, brought her arm back and cold-cocked [Klingenmeyer] right in the face.' She did this six more times before Klingenmeyer was able to push her off him. 'I was thoroughly amazed at the restraint Korey showed. He’s a total gentlemen,' Thompson said. Sister sister: Willow (left) and Bristol Palin (right) apparently tried to go after the mother of Willow's ex-boyfriend . A victim and a gentleman: Host Korey Klingenmeyer (above) was punched in the face seven times by Bristol when he politely asked her to leave the party . Then, Sarah got involved all over again and began to scream profanities at everyone. This morning, Thompson told Good Morning America, 'I heard Sarah Palin scream out, ""You know who we are, don’t you?""' Finally, to cap it all off, Track stood out in front of the house with his shirt off and his middle finger raised at those who were  leaving . Shortly after this the fighting stopped, and the Palins got in their car for the evening, a stretch Hummer, and left. No sooner had the Palins left then the police showed up to take statements from some of the remaining guests. Thompson believes it was the Palins who called the police. Scene of the crime: The home of Klingenmeyer in Anchorage, Alaska . 'It was a really nice, mellow party,' he said. 'Then it turned into the Jerry Springer show.' Thompson, an employee at McKenna Bros. Paving, the company owned by birthday boys Marc and Matt, has apparently been fired from his job for speaking to the press. He has hired legal counsel according to the Alaska Dispatch News. Police spokesperson Jennifer Castro said of the events, ‘At the time of the incident, none of the involved parties wanted to press charges and no arrests were made. She then added, ‘Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party.’ Oddly enough, it seems Sarah may be trying to distance herself from this story, despite numerous eyewitness reports, as she implied on her Facebook she did not see her family Saturday. 'I was traveling yesterday, so I'm posting Todd's 50th birthday greeting a day late, which is fine because the handsome guy barely looks a day over 50,' she wrote on Sunday evening. The police are still investigating, and the Palin family is not commenting.","The family of Sarah Palin was not only involved in a fight over the weekend, but apparently started it while attending another man's birthday party .

"The number of children dying from cancer has dropped by 22 per cent in the last ten years, according to new figures. Ten years ago around 330 children in the UK died from cancer each year, but thanks to better treatments this has now dropped to around 260 each year. The steepest decline was in leukaemia, the most commonly diagnosed children’s cancer, where death rates have almost halved, dropping from around 100 deaths each year to around 55. Ten years ago around 330 children in the UK died from cancer each year, but thanks to better treatments this has now dropped to around 260 each year (File photo) The figures are published today, at the start of Children’s Cancer Awareness Month, by Cancer Research UK charity which attributes much of the fall to tackling childhood cancers by combining a number of different chemotherapy drugs. The charity played a key role in the clinical trials that proved the benefits of these combined treatments, including a large international trial that has helped lead to liver cancer death rates falling by a quarter (26 per cent) in the last decade. Research to improve imaging and radiotherapy techniques is also playing a big part, it says. Professor Pam Kearns, the director of the Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit in Birmingham, said ‘It’s very encouraging to see that fewer children are dying of cancer, but a lot more needs to be done. There are still a number of cancers where progress has been limited – such as brain tumours. ‘Cancer Research UK’s long-standing commitment to clinical trials for children with cancer has been a major factor in developing today’s treatments and is pivotal to ongoing research that will offer new hope to the children and their families. ‘Many children who survive cancer will live with the long-term side effects of their treatment that can have an impact throughout their adult lives, so it’s vital that we find kinder and even more effective treatments for them.’ Around 1,600 children are diagnosed with cancer every year in the UK. Overall survival for childhood cancer has tripled since the 1960s, and three quarters of children with cancer are now cured (File photo) The new figures are announced as Cancer Research UK and TK Maxx celebrate the 10th anniversary of their partnership and the Give Up Clothes For Good campaign, the UK’s biggest clothes collection. Since 2004, TK Maxx has raised £13.2m to help Cancer Research UK find ways to beat children’s cancers sooner, funding research into many areas including developing better treatments that also reduce the long-term side effects for children with cancer. To mark the occasion, TK Maxx will fund the UK’s participation in an international children’s cancer trial led by Professor Richard Grundy to improve survival for children and young people with a type of brain tumour called ependymoma. Since 2004, TK Maxx has raised £13.2m to help Cancer Research UK find ways to beat children’s cancers sooner . These tumours are often aggressive and difficult to treat and better therapies are urgently needed to improve survival and quality of life for young people and their families affected by this devastating disease. Professor Richard Grundy, from the University of Nottingham, said ‘Cancer Research UK has made clinical trials possible that have led to great improvements in treatments for childhood cancers. However, ependymoma brain tumours are exceptionally difficult to treat and survival rates remain poor.’ Around 1,600 children are diagnosed with cancer every year in the UK. Overall survival for childhood cancer has tripled since the 1960s, and three quarters of children with cancer are now cured. Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK’s chief executive said ‘We’ve made great progress in helping more and more children survive cancer than ever before, but this work is not finished – better, kinder treatments must continue to be our target. Our researchers are making great strides every year to help even more children beat the disease.’","Ten years ago around 330 UK children died each year, now down about 260 .

"Tony the Tourist: Tony Blair enjoys the nightlife in Saint Tropez, France, on Saturday before heading to Sardinia . He boasted recently of having ‘toiled over years’ to bring peace to the Middle East – and wrote of his concern at the ‘living nightmare’ in Syria. But if Tony Blair was toiling in his role as Special Envoy to the long-troubled region last week, it is apparently nice work if you can get it. While western governments reacted with fury to claims of a chemical weapons attack in Damascus and made moves towards launching air strikes on Syrian regime forces, the ex-Prime Minister was spotted in some of the most glamorous locations in the Mediterranean. Mr Blair’s busy schedule at the back end of last week involved  visiting several ‘super-yachts’ worth in excess of £100million – apparently three of them in the space of three days. Scroll down for video . He is officially the Special Envoy for the Middle East on behalf of the Quartet – the United Nations, European Union, United Sates and Russia – with a brief to help broker peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. But his role might be expected to see him take a wider interest in the region, and indeed the latest post on his official website – ‘There is hope amid the turmoil of the Middle East’. It is dated August 4 – makes several references to Syria, where the chemical attack was first reported on Wednesday. But a day later, on Thursday, Mr Blair jetted into Sardinia on a private jet, and was whisked away to dine at a restaurant in the glamorous resort of Porto Rotondo. Mr Blair, 60, is familiar with this idyllic spot, having famously visited with wife Cherie in 2004 for a free holiday at the 27-bedroom villa of since-disgraced Italian premier and billionaire Silvio Berlusconi. That jolly was much remarked on at the time – both because Labour MPs were appalled at their leader accepting hospitality from such a sleazy Right-wing host, and the fact Berlusconi sported a ridiculous bandana during their public appearances, to conceal the aftermath of a hair transplant. On his latest visit Mr Blair enjoyed the hospitality of a different billionaire. For after his evening meal last Thursday, he stepped on to a swish motor launch and was ferried out to board a magnificent 377ft super-yacht, the Pelorus, the 16th-largest gin palace in the world. Previously owned by Russian billionaire . and Chelsea football club-owner Roman Abramovich, it was given to his . ex-wife Irina two years ago as part of their £200million divorce . settlement. Special delivery: Tony Blair arrives in Sardinia, via private jet, to have 'meetings with various people,' according to his spokesman . All aboard: Mr Blair spent Thursday evening on the Pelorus, owned by U.S. music mogul David Geffen, worth over £150million . It is now owned by American music mogul David Geffen, 70, one of the few people in the world with enough money to pay the 46 crew the yacht needs – and to hand over the £150million-plus the pleasure craft reportedly cost him. Remarkably, the Pelorus is Mr Geffen’s easy-to-berth runaround – his main yacht is the 453ft Rising Sun. News of Mr Blair’s enthusiasm for the billionaire’s yachts emerged a year ago, when it was reported that he had been seen on board one of them off Corfu. And on his latest stay on board a Geffen craft, Mr Blair seems to have taken the opportunity to visit an even bigger yacht – as onlookers last Thursday saw it draw alongside the Topaz, at 483ft the sixth largest in the world. Out with the lads: Blair leaves Les Palmiers restaurant on Pampelonne Beach, Saint Tropez to board 167ft yach Crazy Me, whose owner is not yet known . No worries: The former Prime Minister appeared to have other things on his mind as reports came from Damascus about chemical weapons attacks . Tony Blair today demanded that Britain and the United States launch military action in Syria. The . former Prime Minister compared the violent Ashar al-Assad regime and . its murdering of its own citizens with chemical weapons to the 'dark . days of Saddam'. Mr Blair, who took Britain to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, said this morning that it is 'time we took sides'. 'People . wince at the thought of intervention. But contemplate the future . consequence of inaction and shudder,' he wrote in The Times. This morning David Cameron returned early from his Cornish holiday to consider whether to recall Parliament. MPs are demanding a binding vote over plans to launch missile strikes on Syria without the backing of the United Nations. Mr Blair urged the Government to ignore 'the impulse to stay clear of turmoil'. 'I . understand every impulse to stay clear of the turmoil, to watch but not . to intervene, to ratchet up language but not to engage in the hard, . even harsh business of changing reality on the ground. 'But we have collectively to understand the consequences of wringing our hands instead of putting them to work.' Owned by the royal family of the United Arab Emirates, it is valued at a colossal £340million, has eight decks, and even a choice of swimming pools. Pleasant though his surroundings were, Mr . Blair soon moved on. And on Saturday he was spotted in the perennial . playground of the international playboy, St Tropez. On land he was surrounded by a team of ever-watchful security guards, but seemed to relax when back on the ocean wave, this time on a motorised launch of the new hi-tech super-yacht Crazy Me. Mr Blair had been on Pampelonne beach, where fashion tycoon Sir Philip Green was throwing a party at the Bar D’O for guests including Simon Cowell. The former premier was not a guest, instead dining at the Les Palmier restaurant, but clearly had bigger fish to fry – for he had a broad grin as he was whisked away by four smartly uniformed crew on a launch from his third super-yacht of the weekend. Crazy Me is 167ft long and crafted entirely from aluminium with ‘an aggressive and unique profile’. She boasts both a master suite and a VIP stateroom, and has a glass-bottomed swimming pool on the upper deck. Only recently completed, she was delivered to her mystery owner in June. Last night a spokesman for Mr Blair refused to discuss who he had been visiting or what he had been doing on the series of super-yachts in the Mediterranean while the Syrian crisis unfolded. The tight-lipped spokesman would add only that ‘he was having meetings with various people’.","Tony Blair jetted to the Med as news broke of chemical attacks .

"When summer is up and it’s time to go back to school, children often suffer from a bout of 'back to school blues' as they begrudgingly return to class. But a researcher has claimed that the effect isn’t limited to people; dogs also get upset when their young owners leave. In a study they found that for many dogs this can leave them feeling abandoned, and some look for a way to lash out. Scroll down for video . A researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts has found that dogs get separation anxiety (stock image shown). It occurs when their young owners go back to school at the end of summer. Dr Dodman says this can leave the dogs feeling lonely and abandoned. In extreme cases this can lead to them lashing out . The research was compiled by Dr Nick Dodman of Tufts University's Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine in Massachusetts. Make your departure a happy time with toys and treats. Create a place in the house where the dog feels safe. Start the new routine before school begins. Don't indulge behavior with baby talk or sympathy. See a vet if it doesn't improve. He found that many of the 80 million dogs in the US had separation anxiety. This led them to bark, howl or whine when their owners were gone. In more extreme cases the departure of a young owner to school at the start of school can lead to the dogs scratching doors, damaging blinds or tearing curtains in their anxiety. And the side effects of children going back to school don't stop there; Dr Dodman also says that some dogs refuse to eat when their owners are gone. ‘There will be an exuberant greeting when you do come home, one that can last several minutes and be completely crazy, then the dog will run to the food bowl,’ he said. For . millions of dogs across the US, summer is gone and so are their best . buddies. Most dogs object for a while but eventually adjust to the new . hours.  But millions of others will feel abandoned, panicky, sad and . unable to cope as they look for ways to lash out, according to research . by Dr Nick Dodman of Tufts University . In addition, nearly half of anxious dogs were found to have noise phobias, so if a storm hits while they are in an empty house, they can panic. Dr Dodman suggests that to ease anxiety in dogs, the departure of children to school should be made a happy time with toys and treats. He also suggests creating a place in the house where the dog feels safe. But ultimately, if the condition of the dog doesn’t improve he suggests seeing a vet is the best option. Dr .

"London has been named the world's most influential city by business magazine Forbes, despite Britain being a 'second rate power' and over a century of 'imperial decline'. The city beat off stiff competition from New York to claim the top spot while Paris came in a distant third ahead of Singapore and Tokyo. London was praised for its strong transport links, long history as a global financial hub and lack of regulations owing to its position outside the U.S. and the eurozone. Still tops: Brilliant transport links and an absence of regulations mean London retains its position as the world's most influential city . Trading hub: Stock market trade in New York levels are 10 times that of London and four times that of Tokyo . Forbes looked at eight key factors - the amount of foreign direct investment, the concentration of corporate headquarters, how many business niches they dominate, air connectivity, strength of producer services, financial services, technology and media power and racial diversity. As the choice of home for much of the world's super-rich, London's enviable position as the historic capital of the English language contributes to its status as a powerful media hub and major advertising center, Forbes notes. The magazine said: 'London not only has a long history as a dominant global financial hub, but its location outside the United States and the eurozone keeps it away from unfriendly regulators. 'Compared to New York, it is also time-zone advantaged for doing business in Asia, and has the second best global air connections of any city after Dubai, with nonstop flights at least three times a week to 89 per cent of global cities outside of its home region of Europe.' London now holds the position of Europe’s top technology startup centre with more than 3,000 tech start up firms as well as Google’s largest office outside Silicon Valley. However the magazine was quick to point out London is not the city it once was - and has suffered over a century of imperial decline while the UK is now a 'second rate power'. Paris was in distant third place owing to it being home to almost all of France's home-grown companies . Neither it nor New York could not consider themselves to be the powerhouses they were throughout the 20th century and while Paris managed to slip into third place most of their competitors are now from outside Europe. Forbes added: 'Paris may rank third in our survey, but it is way below New York and London by virtually every critical measure, and the city’s future is not promising given that France, and much of the EU, are mired in relative economic stagnation. 'Elsewhere, Europe boast a veritable archipelago of globally competitive cities — Munich, Rome, Hamburg — but none is large enough, or unique enough, to break into the top 10 in the future. East Asia is likely to place more cities at the top of the list.' The magazine also notes the continuing decline of Los Angeles, once seen as a potential rival to New York. LA, which has lost around 90,000 jobs since the end of the cold war, has suffered from a shrinking share of the entertainment and aerospace industries. Last year alone major companies Nissan, Occidental Petroleum and Toyota moved out of the city for pastures new. 1. London (pop: 13 million, size: 607 square miles)Brilliant transport links and absence of regulations mean it's still top despite declining imperial power and stiffer competition from outside Europe . 2. New York  (pop: 8.4 million, size: 305 square miles) A close second. Home to most of the world's top investment banks and hedge funds. Its stock market trade levels are 10 times that of London and four times that of Tokyo. 3. Paris (pop: 12,292,895, size: 1,098 sq miles) Way back in third place, but Paris stays strong owing to it being home to almost all of France's home-grown companies. 4. Singapore (pop: 5.3 million, size: 276 sq miles)Top Asian city - it has been named as the best place in the world to do business and attracts the highest level of foreign direct investment. 5. Tokyo (pop: 13.3million, size: 844 square miles) Although it has fallen behind Singapore as Asia's top business city in the Forbes list, it is still the world's largest city in terms of gross domestic product. 6. Hong Kong (pop: 7.2 million, size: 426 square miles) The largest financial centre in the world after London and New York, Hong Kong benefits from far greater freedom than the rest of China. 7. Dubai (pop:2.1 million, size: 1588 sq miles) Dubai's unbeatable air links mean its the world's most connected city for business. It also scores top for diversity with 86 per cent of its residents born abroad8. = Beijing (pop: 21 million, size: 6486 square miles)Home to most of China's state-owned companies as well as the country's elite educational institutions and its most innovative companies.

"A Rastafarian student has been given an 'unlimited suspension' from school because he has dreadlocks. The teenage boy has been banned from attending South Plaquemines High School, Louisiana, until he cuts off his long dreads, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in the area says. The boy's mother and ACLU Louisiana say the dreads are a religious symbol and he cannot give them the chop. Rastafarians see Haile Selassie I, who was Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974, as their Messiah . The boy was sent home on the first day after classes resumed and has missed 10 days of school so far. He went back to school the following week with his hair pinned up but was sent home immediately. The school's policy on boys' hair says it 'may not extend lower than the top of a school shirt collar. Boys' hair may not be pinned up, pulled back, or put in a pony tail'. A letter from ACLU say it violates the student's constitutional rights, the Huffington Post reported. 'The wearing of dreadlocks for [the student] is akin to the wearing of a religious icon by another student,' it says. 'In discriminating against [the student's] religious beliefs, the school is expressing a preference for certain religions, which is unacceptable. 'The school's actions of prohibiting [the student] from attending school until he cuts his hair violates the Louisiana and United States Constitutions. 'We would object if the school were to tell a Christian student they could not wear a cross or if it were to permit the wearing of religious icons of one faith and prohibited those of another faith. The Ethiopian flag carried the Lion of Judah from 1897 until Selassie was deposed in 1974. Rastafarians see their dreadlocks as symbolic of the lion's mane . 'In discriminating against [the student's] religious beliefs, the school is expressing a preference for certain religions, which is unacceptable.' 'The actions of the school ... are the equivalent of an unlimited suspension.' Rastafarians believe the Bible forbids them from cutting their hair, and dreadlocks are a key part of their religious beliefs. The Book of Leviticus says at 21:5: 'They shall not make baldness upon their head.' Rastafarians therefore interpret this as meaning that growing their hair long is spiritual. Rastafarians coil their hair into dreads particularly because they see them as symbolic of the mane of the Lion of Judah - seen on the Ethiopian flag until 1975. The student's mother gave a letter to the school from his church to show that he is a Rastafarian, but this was rejected. School principal John Barthelemy said that the student was sent home but that he is not officially suspended. He said: 'For the record, this particular student, I have him graduating early, we're trying to help him get out of school early. 'The days out of school were not counting against him for suspension or anything on his record, we want to get him back on track.' Mr Barthelemy added that the boy had cut his hair last year, but the ACLU said that his family were not aware of his rights at the time. The civil rights group are now seeking a formal hearing to ask for a dress code exemption for the pupil so he can go back to school. In 2000, a different Rastafarian family in Louisiana were give an exemption to their school dress code, allowing children to wear coverings over their hair that matched school uniform.","The unnamed boy was banned from school because of rules on long hair .

"Phony: Charity Johnson, 34, was arrested last year after pretending to be a high school student for several months . A 34-year-old woman fooled her guardian and her entire high school last year when she pretended to be a 15 year old sophomore. Charity Johnson spent about a month in jail for lying about her identity and age, and then quickly fled Longview, Texas when she was released in June. But classmates and teachers at her tight-knit Christian school say they miss the woman they knew as teen Charity Stevens, and hope to reconnect. 'It's a small school, and the girls here that knew her actually liked her,' Principal Stuart Newlin told ABC. 'One of the girls just yesterday said, ""I miss Charity."" They've had three months to think about how she was much older than she said she was, and they still said that.' New Life is a small school and last year had only 27 students. Newlin says the kids are close and that none of the teachers regret investing time in Johnson's education. He says he has tried to contact Johnson, but no one in the community knows where she has gone to. Johnson was arrested on the night of May 13 - more than six months after she enrolled in the school pretending to be an orphan. According to school officials, Johnson came to New Life last October accompanied by a guardian who turned out to be younger than the fake tenth-grader. During the enrollment process, Johnson gave the name Charity Stevens and indicated that she was 15 years old. Back to school: Johnson was arrested seven months after enrolling in the New Life Christian School. Students at the small school say they miss Johnson, and hope to find a way to contact her . Tamica Lincoln, 30, who took on the role of Johnson's guardian last March, told the station KLTV that the bogus teenager told her that she had been abused by her biological father, who has since died along with her mother. The two women met while working together at a McDonald's located inside the local Walmart, and Johnson confided in Lincoln that she had no place to stay after losing her parents. Lincoln brought the suspected con artist four years her senior into her home 'as a child,' bought her clothes and did her hair. She even attended parent-teacher conferences to talk about the fake sophomore’s impressive academic performance. 'Young' love: During her year as a high-schooler, Johnson even started dating a local man, 23-year-old Rickie Williams (left), and told him she was 18 . 'She acted like a kid. She did her homework. She got good report cards,' the 30-year-old Longview resident told ABC News. She even started dating a local man, 23-year-old Rickie Williams - and told him she was 18. Johnson’s web of lies began unraveling when Lincoln got a call from Obaseki, the head of the Dallas-based charity. Ms Obaseki told Lincoln that she ran a background check on 'Charity Stevens,' which provided more questions than answers. Lincoln then decided to make inquires of her own and called a manager at the McDonald's where both she and Johnson worked. The staffer pulled up the high-schooler's file, which indicated that her birth year was 1979 and her real name Charity Johnson. Conned: Johnson was taken in by 30-year-old McDonald's co-worker Tamica Lincoln (right) who believed the woman's con. After her release from jail in June, Johnson left town . On May 13, Lincoln and the phony orphan’s mentor, Ray Ward, alerted police to the alleged fraud before heading over to the high school. School officials said Johnson came in last October as a home-schooled student without any prior transcripts. Officers who responded to Lincoln’s Longview home asked Johnson to identify herself, and in response she gave them the name Charity Stevens – the same moniker used on her school application. The woman was charged with failure to identify/giving false, fictitious information. Looking at Johnson’s fake Facebook,Twitter and Instagram account created under the nickname Charite, it is easy to understand how those around her could have bought in to her tale of woes. In the photos posted online, Johnson looks like a shy, fresh-faced girl with a pink bow in her neatly combed hair and sparkly manicure. However, in her booking photo, Johnson dressed in a striped jail garb looks not a day younger than her 34 years, with a lined, puffy face and a tangle of hair.","Charity Johnson, 34, was arrested last year for failure to show ID .

"A toddler who died after months of abuse from his ‘monster’ mother was failed repeatedly by social workers. Two-year-old Keanu Williams, who was known to police and children’s services, was beaten to death by Rebecca Shuttleworth. He had 37 injuries including bite marks, a fractured skull and a fist-sized tear in his stomach. Innocence: Keanu Williams, left, beams at the camera in this family photo which gives no hint at the cruelty he would suffer at the hand of his evil mother Rebecca Shuttleworth, right . He was hit repeatedly with a stick or rod over 48 hours and died of internal bleeding, a post-mortem examination found. Paramedics discovered his body at the . home of Shuttleworth’s then boyfriend, Luke Southerton, 32. A review has . begun into why social workers failed to spot the abuse. Keanu’s injuries were not ‘isolated’ but part of a long chain of abuse by his mother, who now faces life behind bars. Yet Shuttleworth, 25, had duped officials into thinking she was ‘caring and competent’. It adds to questions about children’s . services at Labour-run Birmingham City Council, rated ‘inadequate’ since . 2009 after deaths of children known to social workers. Cases include . that of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, starved to death in 2008. Last month the department was labelled ‘utter chaos’ by members of its own watchdog. Yesterday Jane Held, head of the . Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, which is reviewing Keanu’s . death, said social services, medics and police ‘missed a significant . number of opportunities to intervene’. Birmingham Crown Court heard that Shuttleworth had ‘resented’ Keanu virtually from his birth in 2008. Shuttleworth, who was living with . Keanu’s father in Torquay, Devon, saw the child as an ‘obstruction to . living her life as she wanted’, the jury was told. Prosecutor Christopher Hotten QC said . she spent much of her childhood in care as her alcoholic mother . struggled to cope, giving her ‘considerable experience of the care . system’. Keanu Williams, pictured, died on January 9, 2011, after being admitted to hospital with multiple injuries . Shocking: A a body map details the harrowing injuries sustained by Keanu Williams . Brutal: The jury in his mother's trial heard that the two-year-old sustained 37 separated injuries to his body when discovered by paramedics . Callous: Rebecca Shuttleworth, left, was convicted of murdering her son, two, after a long period of torture, while her former partner Luke Southerton, right, was cleared of murder but convicted of cruelty . Denial: Rebecca Shuttleworth and Luke Southerton, pictured together in the dock of Birmingham Crown Court, both denied murder. She was found guilty, he was cleared . Keanu Williams' family has been 'torn apart' by his death, according to his aunt. Angela Shuttleworth, 26, Rebecca Shuttleworth's sister, said the death of the toddler who was known in the family as Kiwi had left 'a gaping hole in our lives'. In a statement she said: 'Keanu was an amazing little boy who had developed a real personality. 'He was full of life and loved playing with his siblings and cousins. He enjoyed all his toys and would empty the toy box every time he came to play, but he especially loved Iggle Piggle from (children's television programme) In The Night Garden . 'Kiwi also loved food - he ate everything and was hungry all the time.' She added: 'Since the tragic death of Kiwi, we haven't been able to grieve or say goodbye to him properly. 'The whole family has been torn apart by this and his death has left a gaping hole in our lives. 'We hope now this is over we can lay Kiwi to rest and begin to have some closure.' Following Keanu’s birth she received . ‘extensive’ support from health and social workers, posing as an . ‘attentive’ mother at parenting classes. She moved back to her home city of Birmingham when Keanu was 15 months old, starting a relationship with Southerton. Mr Hotten said Shuttleworth used her . knowledge of the care system to ‘manipulate social workers, teachers, . doctors and care professionals to believe that she was a competent and . caring mother’. She told staff at the child’s nursery his bruises came . from bumps or falls. In December 2010, she took Keanu to hospital with burned feet, which she claimed came from a radiator beside his bed. She was told police would inspect her home, and texted Southerton to make sure their stories matched up. A month later, paramedics found the . boy dead at the flat in the deprived Ward End suburb. The couple had . dialled 999, claiming Keanu had had a heart attack. Mr Hotten told the . jury Shuttleworth hoped he would ‘get better’ and only called 999 when . she realised it was hopeless. Detective Chief Inspector Caroline . Marsh, who led the investigation for West Midlands Police, said: ‘In the . past, I have described her as a monster and perhaps I would stand by . that.’ The force would not comment on its prior involvement in the case because of the review. Southerton was cleared of murder, . manslaughter and causing or allowing the death, but convicted of cruelty . yesterday after a six-month trial. Shuttleworth, who was convicted of four counts of child cruelty as well as murder, will be sentenced alongside him today. She has been on bail throughout the case and attended court with a woman she was heard to describe as her ‘partner’. Catalogue of injuries: Rebecca Shuttleworth was convicted of murdering her two-year-old son after subjecting him to savage and sustained abuse, the injuries resulting from which where detailed at Birmingham Crown Court .

"Rescued: Pocket with Karla Barricella before she headed off to live her new life . An emaciated, skeletal pitbull puppy dumped alongside her equally malnourished brother in a New Jersey park last month has found a new home this week after recovering. Pocket and her brother Bugsy were found by a jogger in Paterson having been dumped, near death on a baseball park. When animal control officers arrived to take the dogs away they found six month old Pocket standing over her brother protecting him and trying to comfort her struggling sibling. Sadly Bugsy died a day later at Paterson Animal Control. The puppies both weighed 14 pounds instead of a healthy 50 and the veterinarian who examined them said they had noth been subjected to an 'extreme, extreme case of neglect.' Despite the death of her sibling, Pocket returned to health and gained 11 pounds in two weeks and has been sent to a new home weighing more than 25 pounds. Karla Barricella of Bergen County adopted Pocket after reading about her case in a newspaper. Her last dog, a rottweiler, died two years ago and Karla told NBC New York that she is now ready to be a dog owner again. 'My heart opened up again,' said Barricella to NBC New York. 'The love -- you can just feel it. She is the sweetest, dearest animal ... and I will give her the warmest, dearest home in the world.' Karla's son, James, said that his mother is sure to spoil Pocket. 'Her dogs get more presents at Christmas than we did as kids because she takes good care of them,' said James Barricella to NBC New York. Sickening: Bugsy (left) did not make it, but Pocket (right) has recovered well enough to be re-homed with in New Jersey .

'There's no such thing as bad animals in the world. There's bad people that allow it to happen,' John DeCando of Paterson Animal Control said when the pups were found.

"A Texas school district is arming its teachers for the new school year. Argyle Independent School District is placing warning signs outside its four schools saying staff may use 'whatever force is necessary' to protect their students. The public will not be allowed to know which teachers, or how many, are armed with concealed pistols, but they have had to pass tests and training courses. Scroll down for video . Warning: All four schools in Texas' Argyle district will arm its teachers with guns for the new school year . The signs outside the schools read: 'Attention. Please be aware that the staff at Argyle ISD are armed and may use whatever force is necessary to protect our students.' The plan is coming into action after a vote in January, and follows 'a comprehensive evaluation of District's safety, security and emergency response politics' after 'the unfortunate and tragic situations that occurred in multiple American schools over the last several years,' a release obtained by the New York Daily News states. Any armed teacher will have to have a handgun licence, as well as pass an interview, psychological exam and a firearms and emergency response training course. 'I think if a tragedy does occur, lives can be saved by guns being in the right hands, and I think the teachers here might be able to stop something like that and life can be saved,' parent Lacey Fenoglio told CW33. Aftermath: Hilltop Elementary School, where staff will now carry guns in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy . The four schools in the district where guns will now be in the hands of teachers are Hilltop Elementary, Argyle Intermediate School, Argyle Middle School and Argyle High School. Argyle is the latest in a string of districts to arm its teachers or increase security in schools in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy in 2012. Schools in Shamrock and Levelland districts, also in Texas, adopted the policy of handing guns to staff last year. Harrold Independent School District in north-central Texas voted to take it up after a shooting in Virginia back in 2007. At least eight states have passed laws allowing schools to arm their teachers since the Sandy Hook  massacre - which left 20 children and six adults dead at the Newtown, Connecticut elementary school. As well as in Texas, certain employees at schools in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee are  allowed to carry weapons on school grounds. In Texas, at least 78 of the 1,024 school districts have decided to use the plan - whereas just one did before Sandy Hook. Although just seven of these have put it into action to date - by sending their staff to train as 'marshals' - the Wall Street Journal reports. Others have opted to instead increase school police presence or rely on the local authorities. This news comes as America is still reeling after a nine-year-old girl shot dead her shooting instructor with an Uzi submachine gun when he told her to go 'full auto'. The incident at Bullets and Burgers shooting range in White Hills, Arizona, left 39-year-old Charles Vacca dead.","Argyle Independent School District becomes latest to put law into force .

"A camper impressing his friends camping in Oregon with some mean licks on his guitar attracted a nasty admirer earlier this month - a rabid bat. Derrick Skou, from Oregon was jamming away when the bat swooped down from the sky and landed on the startled guitar players neck. Expecting the bat to fly off once it had realized where it has landed, Skou was obviously shocked to get a nip on the neck from the blood-thirsty creature. Scroll Down for Video . Swooped: The bat can be seen on Skou's neck - having flown around the three men who were relaxing while camping . Luckily for Skou, a quick thinking friend fired a BB gun at the bat and killed it, enabling them to take it along with their friend to hospital for testing. Once there they discovered that the bat had the fatal condition rabies, which animals pass on through their saliva and blood. Skou was started on an immediate regime of drugs to battle the effects of rabies, which have left him tired and exhausted. 'This thing came out of nowhere,' said Derrick Skou to KBOI. 'I was thinking it was a good day until then.' Get off! The bat crawls up Skou's neck and bites him with its rabies infected teeth . Where is it? The bat flies bites the guitar player - before they track it before shooting it dead with a BB gun . 'Something hit me. I was concentrating on staying in time and all that, and it hit me here, and I kind of saw something out of my peripheral vision. And then it's there, and then it just bit me.' The first that Skou knew was when he saw the bat land on his neck. 'It was like a cold dog nose,' said Skou. 'It was a cold bat nose, mouth, whatever. It didn't sting. I wasn't injected with anything. It was just a cold bite.' The bat tried to swoop down for two more passes before it was shot dead. 'Whether we would get in trouble for shooting it, and I said well, it drew first blood. We need to take care of this thing,' Skou said.",Derrick Skou was bitten by the animal carrying the deadly disease .
"The Turkish FA are exploring the possibility of West Ham teenager Oscar Borg pledging his allegiance to Turkey. The 16-year-old left-back, who had a spell training at Manchester United earlier this summer only for a deal to fall through, has agreed a two year scholarship with West Ham. Borg has been touted as a promising wing-back and that has alerted Turkish football officials. There could be a tug-of-war over Oscar Borg's international future if he is eligible to play for Turkey . They have learned that the teenager's grandmother was born in Istanbul and are checking whether he is eligible to play international football for them. It has been suggested that should Borg commit to Turkey, offers from the country's biggest clubs such as Galatasray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas would follow suit. Getting Borg, who has drawn comparisons to the world's most expensive player Gareth Bale, to commit himself to a professional contract has been a coup for West Ham. But Manchester United are said to be sniffing around another promising young Hammers defender in 15-year-old Reece Oxford.

Antonio Conte has played down Mario Balotelli's omission from Italy's squad for the upcoming qualifiers . The former AC Milan forward has struggled for form since joining Liverpool in the summer . Conte said: 'He started on a new path, it's not easy. Let's give him time to integrate himself in this new league.' Southampton striker Graziano Pelle received his first call up and Conte says he 'represents that which I've said from the very first day - meritocracy.'

"A criminal court in Austria has sentenced former Austria international Sanel Kuljic to five years in prison for match-fixing and physically harassing other players. A former team-mate of Kuljic at Kapfenberg, Dominique Taboga, was given a three-year prison term for his role in the betting scam, which included manipulation of 18 domestic league games in Austria's first and second divisions from 2004 to October 2013. All top-flight games under suspicion included either Kapfenberg or Groedig - both former clubs of Taboga, who was issued a lifetime ban by the Austrian Football Federation in February. Former Austrian international Sanel Kuljichas been sentenced to five years in prison . Kuljic and Taboga partly confessed their wrongdoing during the two-month trial. Eight of the 10 defendants, who included three more former players, were handed prison sentences. Two others were released because of a lack of evidence. The verdicts can be appealed. Kuljic, who played 20 times for Austria until 2007 and retired five years later, was convicted for his alleged leading role in the biggest match-fixing scandal to rock Austrian football. Kuljic and four others were charged for physically threatening players after some of the match-fixing attempts failed. The five men allegedly forced them into handing over money, cars and a laptop to settle the bets they lost. His former team-mate Dominique Taboga was also sentencedto three years in prison in a match-fixing case . The players allegedly received 7,000 to 25,000 euros ($9,370-$33,480) per match to influence the outcome of the games, enabling their backers from Austria, Albania, Serbia and Chechnya to earn betting profits. The nine-year-long scam ended in November, when Taboga filed charges against Kuljic, claiming his former teammate was blackmailing him over an unsettled debt. Criminal investigators later obtained a list with 26 footballers' names on it from two Albanian men after they were arrested for allegedly helping the players coordinate the fixing and placing of bets with Asian online bookmakers. Prosecutors said investigations were ongoing, and 15 more people could still be charged for their alleged involvement.","Criminal court sentences Austrian Kuljic to five years in prison .

"Clearly inspired by Jesus' words 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you', a pair of Christian mixed martial artists knock each other out with simultaneous blows to their privates. Filmed for the now released 'Fight Church' documentary, the two fighters are part of the burgeoning Christian mixed martial arts movement that espouses the mantra, 'Jesus never quit, he never tapped out.' Indeed, the documentary, which was funded by $30,000 raised through crowd sourcing, attempts to answer the hard questions raised by combining religion and extreme physical violence, such as, 'Can you love your neighbor as yourself and at the same time knee him in the face as hard as you can?' Scroll Down for Video . Moment of impact: This is the sickening double knee to the privates from each fighter which leaves them both sprawled on the canvas . Pain: The two fighters are contorted in pain on the canvas after striking each other at the same time during a fight . Introducing themselves before the fight, one of the two men who knock each other expresses his desire to get closer to God during the brutal battle. 'The hope is that through the fight I can create a relationship with person I am fighting and Christ too,' says the fighter. 'If I win the fight its because God gave me that fight, it's not anything I have done.' 'Its already been decided who won. It's just you wait to find our what happens' After the unfortunate result, the fighter sits in the dressing room with a bag of ice cooling over his now battered privates. You'll be Okay: One of the MMA fighter's is left to struggle with his injury in the aftermath of the fight . His pastor and leading light in the evangelical mixed martial arts world, Paul Burress, blesses him. 'Dear God thank you for the win. Thank you for making (the fighter) him ok and still walking,' says Burress. 'I pray there is no damage, nothing swells up badly here (his testicles) and God I just thank you for the safety out there. Amen.' Focusing on Senior Pastor Paul Burress and his Rochester, New York, Trinity Church and its offshoot MMA school, Trinity Training, 'Fight Church' explores the contradictions inherent in fighting and organised Christianity. Senior Pastor Paul Burress at his Trinity Church in Rochester, New York, is an avid proponent of Mixed Martial Arts and evangelical Christianity . Theology student and Mixed Martial Arts expert Scott Sullivan (left) prays while Paul Burress preaches to his flock . 'In life there are times when you take shots cause its a battle out there and the enemy is trying to seek and destroy us,' explained Burress to his congregation in a scene from 'Fight Church'. 'He wants to destroy your families, he wants to destroy you personally. 'That's where the bible gives you your training. 'I love fighting.' Directed by Oscar winning short film-maker, Daniel Junge, 'Fight Church' travels the country to interview religious MMA figures. 'People may say, mixed martial arts is wrong, Jesus told everybody to turn the other cheek,' says 'Fight Pastor' Brandon Beals to the camera. 'I would be really quick to say, 'This is probably not the church for you! 'The greatest example is in scripture where Jesus was a fighter. 'That is the type of Jesus that I want to serve.' Two evangelical Christians pummel each other in a caged ring at a Mixed Martial Arts fight encouraged by church goers . Mixing violent language with religious talk, the pastors in the documentary are unequivocal in their beliefs. 'There are definitely a lot of people who think there is a contradiction between fighting and Christianity,' explains Scott Sullivan, who studies theology and owns a MMA gym in Houston, Texas. 'This is two participants entering into a ring or a cage saying, we're gonna test each other today and the best man's gonna win.' Mixed Martial Arts in illegal in New York State and the film explores the conflict between Burress and the state legislature in Albany. 'Personally I would prefer to have a full MMA competition here at the church, but that is not legal in the state of New York,' explains Burress . The congregation is offered Mixed Martial Arts, boxing and self defence lessons in tandem with their religious classes . Paul Burress encourages his flock from the stands as the audience made up of his congregation cheers another fight on . Appalled at his lobbbying for MMA licenses at his church, a state official articulates his opposition. 'It befuddles me why somebody, especially a minister would try to take this to the next level of violence,' says the official. In an indication that 'Fight Church' intends to pull no punches, children are seen involving themselves in the fighting. 'I' am gonna go in there and rip this kids head off,' says one particularly enthusiastic MMA child fighter. Mixed Martial Arts is the fastest growing sport in the United States . Sadly though, one of the brave children comes off worst in a MMA fight with a smaller kid and can't help but cry. For the filmakers, the mixing of violence and religion is fascinating. 'On the surface, many find the two as incongruent,' said Daniel Junge to Loveland Magazine. 'And I think it’s very topical and a popular subject matter as we live in an overtly Christian nation and MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) is the fastest rising sport. 'The overlap between those makes a really interesting subculture to observe. Controversially, children are encouraged to fight each other as part of evangelical martial arts programs . Overcome by the pain of losing, one little boy begins to cry after his physically draining fight . 'There are many in the film giving interpretations of the Bible. 'But one thing you can say emphatically and without question, is that, nowhere does it outlaw Mixed Martial Arts. 'Therefore religion is such that everyone has their own interpretation; sometimes a very passionate interpretation of whether or not it encompasses their lifestyle. 'The people who inhabit this lifestyle, fight and are devout Christians believe that they are no contradictions there. For the fighters themselves, the competition is religious in itself. 'The hope is that through the fight I can create a relationship with the person I'm fighting and extend Christ to him,' says one dedicated fighter.","Painful incident filmed during making of 'Fight Church' documentary .

"Portugal coach Fernando Santos has started his makeover of the national team by naming five new players, including Southampton captain Jose Fonte in his first squad selection. Santos took over from Paulo Bento last month and is trying to turn around Portugal's recent dip in form, which included a 1-0 loss to Albania in its opening European Championship qualifier. Santos turned to talented youngsters as he picked defenders Fonte, Cedric and Ivo Pinto, and midfielders Adrien Silva and Joao Mario, who have never played for Portugal. Southampton captain Jose Fonte has earned a first call up to the Portugal national team . The defender (C) has impressed during Saint's excellent start to the Premier League season . Saints skipper Fonte was included on a preliminary 40-man list earlier this week and has now made the final cut.

"A tape which was allegedly the final recording of Joan Rivers is a fake, the late comedian's representative said today. An audio recording, which was revealed by The New York Post on Tuesday, was purportedly Ms Rivers in a promo clip for a friend's new, off-Broadway show. The late star's rep, Judy Katz, told The Post today: 'The recording is a fraud. Joan never made any such tape. 'This is a publicity stunt that was created by Brad Zimmerman and his public relations representative, Beck Lee, and is wholly disrespectful to the memory of Joan Rivers.' Scroll down for video . The alleged 'final recording' of Joan Rivers is a fraud, her rep said on Tuesday, and was an insult to her memory . In a statement to MailOnline today, Beck Lee said: 'On behalf of the production of My Son the Waiter we regret that the tape we were given is not authentic. We believed that it was, especially because we knew that it was Joan's wish to take care of Brad. 'Speaking of Brad, he had nothing to do with this situation. Offending Joan or her memory is the last thing he would do. If offense is taken by an inauthentic recording being distributed, by either Joan's family colleagues or fans, we regret this. 'We accepted the recording from its source purely because we believed Joan's wish to support Brad was being honored by its creation and distribution.' Lee had no comment on the identity of the provider of the tape. Ms Katz said that Ms Rivers had agreed to record a promo for her friend later on the same day that she had the treatment - but it never happened. n the clip, a voice, promoted as Rivers, complained about a problem with her voice. 'My voice has been bothering me,' the voice said on tape. 'I don't know what it is.' Ms Rivers attended a Manhattan clinic for an elective procedure on her vocal cords on August 28 where she went into cardiac arrest and went into a coma. She never woke up and passed away on September 4 at the age of 81. The audio tape was believed to have been recorded by Ms Rivers for her friend, Brad Zimmerman. The Post reported that she had volunteered to make a radio ad for his off-Broadway show, My Son the Waiter, a Jewish Tragedy. Melissa Rivers and her son Cooper attend her beloved mother's funeral in New York City on September 7. The comedienne passed away after slipping into a coma following a minor procedure at a Manhattan clinic . 'Joan used Brad as an opening act many times, and when we asked her if she'd do the spot, she said ''sure'' immediately,' an unnamed representative told the Post this week. At the start of the clip, coughing can be heard. 'I told [you] I didn't feel good,' a voice said. 'My voice has been bothering me. I don't know what it is...I feel like s***. I'm tired already.' The tape then goes into a typically acerbic Rivers' performance, with zingers riffing on Zimmerman's decades as a waiter. 'Hi, I'm Joan Rivers, can we talk?' the voice on the recording said. 'About.. Brad Zimmerman... he waited on tables for 29 years - stupid, or what - before he got up the nerve to write a hilarious show. Stupid! He's dumber than Heidi Abromowitz!' Heidi was an fictional character created by Ms Rivers who she referred to as 'tramp of the century'. 'This is terrible copy. Who wrote this crap?' the voice continued. 'I feel sick... Anyway, the critics are calling it hilarious, a total must-see, and I love him, too. So don't wait 29 years to see my friend.' The recording then says that they will need to record a second take. 'My voice is bothering me... I can't... I have to do it again,' the voice added. 'Coming to the Triad Theater, starting October 10 through New Year's,' the voice starts up again. 'I have better things to do on New Year's than this s***!' After one last plug for the show she signs off for good.","The comedienne was supposedly recording an advertisement for friend Brad Zimmerman's new off-Broadway show .

"The unemployed will be made to undergo attitude tests, the employment minister has revealed. Benefits-seekers will be judged on whether they are ‘determined’, ‘bewildered’ or ‘despondent’ about taking a job, under plans prepared by Esther McVey. Jobseekers who are judged to be less mentally prepared will be given intensive coaching at the job centre. Scroll down for video . Jobseekers will have to take attitude tests to determine whether or not they are likely to accept jobs under the new plans (file image) ‘It will be scales of eager, despondent, maybe apprehensive,’ said Miss McVey. ‘There are factors within that: somebody who is apprehensive but willing is different from someone who is reticent but disengaged. 'For a mum coming back to work after a long time, it could be about self-confidence and self-esteem. ‘It is a tailor-made, far more sophisticated system.’ The pilot scheme has been put together under plans by Employment Minister Esther McVey . Jobseekers’ levels of self-belief and behavioural norms will be assessed by interviewers. The claimants will be asked to describe what they think the ‘risks of going to work’ and the ‘value of work’ are. Miss McVey’s ‘segmentation’ programme has been inspired by the work of the wife of the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, Therese Rein. Her company has used attitude profiling in back-to-work schemes since the 1990s. A UK pilot scheme is taking place in three job centres and, if successful, it will be rolled out for a voluntary trial involving 27,000 jobseekers in 27 cities. The idea will be to see whether the attitude tests can accurately predict whether someone will take a job. It is thought the tests could be used to select candidates for the work programme, under which claimants have to work in order to receive benefits. It will also be used to recruit people to a new scheme obliging the long-term unemployed to spend 35 hours a week at the job centre as they learn to write cover letters and sit interviews.","Plans prepared by Esther McVey include attitude tests for unemployed .

"Even by the madness of football salaries, it is a staggering sum of money. Little-known even to fans of his new club until yesterday, Colombia’s Radamel Falcao last night became the highest-paid player in English football after joining Manchester United on loan. And his eye-watering salary, understood to be at least £300,000-a-week, is also likely to mean a new bonanza for the city’s shopping boutiques thanks to big-spending Coleen Rooney – as her husband Wayne is said to be in for a pay rise to match it. Scroll down for video . Making waves: Falcao, 28, and his glamorous Argentinian singer wife Lorelei Taron, 26, were pictured enjoying the beaches of Miami back in June . The newly-crowned England captain’s current £230,000-a-week contract is rumoured to contain a clause dictating that he must be the Old Trafford club’s highest earner. Even the most extravagant footballer’s wife is surely going to have their work cut out spending that sort of windfall – although the 28-year-old infamously flew out to Brazil for this summer’s World Cup with an astonishing 15 suitcases in tow for herself and sons Kai, four, and Klay, one. It remains to be seen whether she will find competition in Falcao’s glamorous Argentinian singer wife Lorelei Taron, 26. The couple, who met at an evangelical church when Falcao was playing in Buenos Aires, were pictured enjoying the beaches of Miami back in June along with baby daughter Dominique Garcia. Falcao, 28, who did not play for Colombia during the tournament due to knee ligament damage, only joined French club Monaco last year for a colossal £50million. He yesterday agreed to a reported £15million season-long loan deal at Manchester United, who have struggled so far this season despite replacing sacked David Moyes with former Dutch national coach Louis van Gaal. On the pitch: The Colombian striker did not play during the World Cup due to knee ligament damage, only joined French club Monaco last year for a colossal £50million . Football pundits had speculated that the club would struggle to attract the biggest names after failing to qualify for the lucrative UEFA Champion’s League this season, but Falcao’s breath-taking salary is likely to have proved a more than adequate consolation for leaving the tax haven of Monaco for England. Arsenal fan Piers Morgan tweeted: ‘When United told Falcao they were in Europe, did he realise they meant only geographically?’ Cross-town rivals Manchester City had been favourites to land his services, while only on Saturday Falcao himself posted - and later deleted - a tweet appearing to confirm a move to Real Madrid, underlining the ferocious negotiations going on behind the scenes. Even based on a conservative estimate of £300,000 a week, his earnings break down as £42,857 a day, £1,785 an hour or £29 a minute. Fellow new recruit Angel di Maria, who signed last week from Real Madrid for a British record £59.7m, is understood to be taking home only marginally less, at £280,000-a-week. By comparison, the players generally regarded as the finest in the world, Argentina’s Lionel Messi and Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo, who both play in Spain, are understood to be paid £292,000 and £288,000-a week respectively. Travelling in style: The Colombian striker arrived in Manchester yesterday to sign the deal in a private jet . Not least among those eagerly anticipating the hoped-for cascade of wealth will be the estate agents of the North West, with the two South Americans joining other new signings Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw staying at Manchester’s Lowry Hotel until they find homes commensurate with their earnings. Falcao’s father, Radamel García, was a Colombian star of the 1970s, naming his son after a legendary Brazilian footballer. Now a devout Christian, the youngster was nicknamed ‘El Tigre’ – The Tiger – after joining Argentinian side River Plate when he was 15 for his tenacity, meeting his future wife there when he was 18. He and the club’s other new signings will have a long way to go to match 28-year-old Rooney’s overall wealth however, now put at £60million thanks to lucrative endorsements from Harper Collins, Nike, EA Sports and Coca-Cola. As for Mrs Rooney, her husband’s rumoured pay rise could see her forced to make more Twitter retorts to those who brand her extravagant, as with her response to criticism of the mountain of luggage she took to Brazil. ‘There are more people in my party than me and the kids,’ she wrote. ‘Nappies, formula milk, toys, bottles, wipes, and a lot of clothes to stay to the end of the tournament!! I have faith and support my country!!’ The orgy of spending running up to the closure of last night’s transfer window by English clubs was last night on course to smash the £1billion barrier for the first time over the calendar year, fuelled by the Premier League’s colossal £5.5 billion television rights deal. Passenger: After touching down, he was taken to United's training ground at Carrington to put pen to paper .","Striker has reportedly signed £15million season-long deal at Old Trafford .

"Young women are obsessed with being ‘hot’, the actress Jacqueline Bisset has claimed. They show themselves off in such an ‘obvious way’ that men feel like they are ‘in a sweet shop’, she said.

She has never married but has had a number of long-term relationships. Miss Bisset attributed the change in women’s behaviour to ‘desperation’ but warned that they often end up feeling used as a result. ‘I went through a period like that, when I dressed and behaved in a certain way,’ she added. ‘I couldn’t handle the results: it didn’t get me where I wanted to be. ‘So I started to be more low key and I got better relationships as a consequence.’ Miss Bisset also revealed that she has never ‘fully embraced’ feminism and enjoyed ‘taking care’ of men. But ageing has made her feel ‘invisible’, she said.","Young women are obsessed with being ‘hot’, says actress Jacqueline Bisset .

"Michael Winner was one of the world’s greatest bon viveurs. So when his tombstone was unveiled last week, it was always going to have a fitting epitaph. ‘Never a loser be, only a winner he’, the inscription read. Michael Winner, pictured with his wife, Geraldine, died aged 77 in January 2013 after battling liver disease . The fitting tombstone epitaph to the late film director was unveiled at a Jewish ceremony in Willesden, London . Family and close friends of the late film director gathered last Friday for the unveiling at an intimate Jewish ceremony. Winner, who directed the Death Wish series, died aged 77 in January 2013 after battling liver disease. Broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson, songwriter Don Black and set designer Crispian Sallis – who worked for Winner from the age of 17 and designed the granite headstone – joined his wife Geraldine to unveil it at Willesden Jewish Cemetery. Sir Michael, 79, said: ‘You either loved him or you hated him and I loved him. He could have a row with anyone but he was an irreverent, funny and challenging man. We had a long and important friendship.’ Rabbi Lee Sunderland, who led the service, said: ‘The word headstone in Hebrew means the same as signpost or bus stop.’ He explained that the stone was there to give friends and family ‘direction’ and ‘inspiration’ from Winner’s achievements. Geraldine said: ‘It was a lovely ceremony.’ Crispian Sallis, designer of the stone, joined guests including Sir Michael Parkinson for the ceremony . Barry McKay, a retired music publisher and Winner’s friend, said: ‘Michael was quite an entertainer in his own right and a terrific character. ‘He accumulated a substantial fortune through the exercise of unique talents, hard work and special skills ... in a very competitive world. 'When he chose his beneficiaries he did so with the intent to deliver, which he did. The facts are that all of Michael’s bequests were more than covered by the close to £50million of assets (before tax and his famous Coutts overdraft) that he left behind.’ Winner formed the Police Memorial Trust in May 1984 after being moved by the death of officer Yvonne Fletcher in St James’s Square, London. A service held in his honour at the National Police Memorial in June last year was attended by more than 500 people – including Sir Roger Moore and Sir Michael Caine.","Family and friends of late film director gather for unveiling of headstone .

"Just because barbecued meat is blackened does not mean it is cooked properly, the Food Standards Agency has warned . If you’re getting ready to have your last barbecue of the summer this bank holiday, you may need your oven turned on too. A government agency is warning that food should be cooked in the oven and then finished up on the BBQ to help prevent food poisioning. The Food Standards Agency said cooks are making their guests ill by charring meat on the barbecue but not cooking it all the way through. The agency said the number of food poisoning cases has doubled over the summer. A survey found 94 per cent of barbecuers had at least one habit that risked the health of their guests – such as undercooking raw meat or cross contaminating food by leaving cooked and raw meat together. One in five people has become ill as a result of the food being under-cooked or because of the chef’s bad habits. Just because food is blackened does not mean it is cooked and the agency are warning to check the meat is cooked all the way through and be aware that disposable BBQs take much longer to cook food properly. The agency has released a list of warnings to help prevent a fun BBQ being overshadowed by a bout of sickness ahead of the bank holiday weekend. It says one of the biggest causes of food poisoning is cross contamination in the kitchen. The agency is warning cooks to store raw and cooked meat separately in your fridge and to use separate utensils when handling the food. Many people wash chicken before they cook it, but the Food Standards Agency says not to, as it just spreads germs around the kitchen. It also warns: ‘You may have heard of salmonella and E.coli, which are well known causes of food poisoning, but you may not be aware that at least 65% of chicken sold in the UK contains a bug called campylobacter. ‘Campylobacter poisoning can lead to sickness, diarrhoea, disability and even worse. Those most at risk are children and older people. If you want your barbecue to be remembered for the right reasons, follow the FSA’s advice on beating the barbecue bugs.’ Advising pre-cooking for chicken, the advice reads: ‘Your friends and family will still experience that special barbecue ‘scorched’ taste – and you will know that you’ve cooked the chicken all the way through. This technique can also be used for sausages, burgers and kebabs if you’re cooking for large numbers, as you’ll want to avoid providing undercooked food.’","Food Standards Agency warns barbecuers are not cooking meat properly .

"The corncockle is a dainty pink or purple flowering plant that can be potentially fatal if ingested . A group of Girl Guides unwittingly planted poisonous wild flowers in a public park as part of a project backed by the BBC’s Countryfile programme. Council groundsmen were called in to clear the rare toxic corncockles after being alerted by an amateur photographer. Around 230,000 packets of mixed seeds were given away as part of the Grow Wild campaign to encourage members of the public to plant native wild flowers, meaning they could have sprung up in other public areas. Although touching the plants carries a low risk of harm, ingesting the plant or its seeds can lead to severe stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness, slow breathing and even death. The Guides sowed the seeds in Jubilee Park in Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, in May. Mike McKee, who identified the corncockles, said: ‘I looked in my flower book and it said these were scant and very rare, so I did a bit more research on them. When I googled them I found out they could be deadly.’ The corncockle is a dainty pink or purple flowering plant. At one time, they were a common sight in fields, but modern agricultural methods have all but eliminated them from the wild – hence their inclusion in the ‘Grow Wild’ scheme. Cultivated corncockle seeds are sold widely so it is not uncommon to see them in gardens. Countryfile worked with the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew to promote the seed packets during an episode of the programme earlier this year. Kew arranged the production and distribution of the seed packets, which were sent out to members of the public in March. Professor Monique Simmonds, director of the Kew Innovation Unit, assured gardeners that the plants are not high risk. She said: ‘This plant, like many we have in our gardens, does contain compounds that can be toxic if eaten in large amounts or eaten frequently over a period of time. Scroll down for video . Countryfile worked with the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew to promote the seed packets that the Girl Guides planted during an episode of the programme earlier this year . ‘The toxic compounds are in higher concentrations in the seeds. If eaten by a child, they would most likely be sick or complain of a stomach ache. There is no evidence that eating a few seeds would cause acute toxicity.’ Guy Barter, of the Royal Horticultural Society, added: ‘Merely touching this plant is a very low risk indeed. We know of no instances of harm occurring from this plant in gardens.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Earlier this year Countryfile worked with Kew on their Grow Wild campaign and the packs of seeds in the give-away were provided and distributed by Kew.’","Girl Guides planted rare toxic corncockles in Wiltshire park .

"Thousands of lives could be saved by a £10 blood test that can tell in 30 minutes whether someone has had a heart attack. Current tests can take six hours or more, during which patients may have another attack or suffer further cardiac damage that could be fatal. The test has been successfully used in a trial at Manchester Royal Infirmary and could now be rolled out across the health service. The £10 heart attack test has been successfully used in a trial at Manchester Royal Infirmary and could now be rolled out across the health service . Doctors say the new method – known as the H-FABP test – will quickly pinpoint heart attacks, reducing the need for extensive hospital screening and saving time and money. If patients have one heart attack, however minor, they are far more likely to suffer a serious one in the near future. Detecting such initial attacks is vital so that sufferers can have appropriate treatment. For example, a stent, or small tube, can be implanted to help support weak arteries. The £10 test searches for a protein called H-FABP, or heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, which is released into the blood in a heart attack. It has been developed by a team at Randox Health in Crumlin, Northern Ireland. When patients visit A&E with chest pains, doctors often recommend tests to rule out a heart attack. This is the single most common reason for hospital admission – yet in most cases, the pains are down to some other cause. At the moment, suspected heart attack patients have an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a blood test, which can take more than ten times longer than the H-FABP test . At the moment, suspected heart attack patients have an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a blood test, which can take more than ten times longer than the H-FABP test. An ECG costs £60 to £250, but can not detect minor attacks. Experts say many patients are wrongly sent home as a result. Dr Rick Body, a consultant in emergency medicine at Manchester Royal Infirmary, said the new test ‘offers the potential to rule out heart attack in many patients as early as their time of presentation to hospital’. ‘This means doctors have a more accurate insight into who is at risk,’ he added. ‘Many patients with chest pain are admitted to hospital for hours or even days although most of them don’t have a heart problem and don’t need to stay. These patients could be reassured much earlier if we had better tests.’ Gary Smyth, the medical director of Randox Health, said existing tests are not sensitive enough. The NHS says coronary heart disease, which leads to heart attacks, is the biggest cause of death in Britain and worldwide. It occurs when blood supply to the heart is blocked by a build-up of fatty substances. Smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes and high blood pressure all contribute to the condition, which causes 74,000 deaths in the UK each year. Around one in five men and one in eight women will die from the disease. Men are significantly more at risk than women up to the age of 50.","Current tests can take six hours or more, during which patients may have another coronary .

"Playing football is one of the staples of childhood in Britain. But a top neuro-science expert has now said youngsters should be banned from heading the ball because it is too dangerous. Dr Michael Grey, a motor neuro-science expert at the University of Birmingham, says the impact of the brain against the skull causes damage. Children’s neck muscles are not developed enough to handle the shock of impact, he said. Top neuro-surgeon Michael Grey has said youngsters should be banned from heading the ball because it is too dangerous . Several high profile doctors have warned about children heading footballs after scans have shown apparent damage to the brains of professional players. However research and animal experiments have resulted in mixed findings. Dr Grey told Sky News: ‘I do not think that children should stop sport, the obesity epidemic means we need to encourage them. ‘But we do need to look at rule changes and the way we train children. ‘Children should not be heading the ball. We don’t know at what age children’s necks become strong enough to withstand the movement of the head when the head is struck by the ball. ‘Some of my colleagues have suggested 14 but I really think it is individual. In addition the brain starts to shake and rotates when the head is struck by the ball. ‘The brain bounces back and forth and it is the impact of the brain against the inside of the skull causes additional damage.’ His comments come as the Football Association issue new guidelines on concussion and head injuries. Boys will be boys: They should play sport but should not head the ball says Dr Michael Grey . The new rules stipulate that if a player loses consciousness they must be immediately taken off the pitch and not allowed to return to play. But if there is not a loss of consciousness, it is up to the team doctor to decide when a player should carry on if they can should come off the field after a blow to the head. Some schools in the US have already banned children from heading the ball during games. An inquest into the death in 2002 of England and West Bromwich Albion footballer Jeff Astle ruled that he died from an ‘industrial disease’ – brain damage linked to heading a heavy ball throughout his career. The new FA rules have angered the family of Astle as they have no specific guidance to heading the ball and the effect it can have. West Brom and England footballer Jeff Astle died of industrial disease - heading the ball . Dawn Astle, his daughter, said: ‘We know what killed dad, the coroner’s court said it was industrial disease: heading footballs killed dad and the Football Association just don’t acknowledge it. ‘Twelve-and-a-half years on, they still haven’t acknowledged what killed him. ‘We have real worries, not just for current footballers, and of course not just professionals - we’re talking about amateurs as well - but about football’s future, about the children in the game. ‘They need to know the risks, then they can make informed choices.’ The Astle family and one of the world’s leading neuro-surgeons, Dr Willie Stewart, are meeting FA representatives including chairman Greg Dyke to persuade them of their case. A report by MP, Chris Bryant and paralympic gold medalist and member of the House of Lords, Baroness Grey-Thompson, entitled ‘Concussion can kill’ called for a parliamentary investigation into head injuries in sport. Published in June, the report asks if steps can be taken to limit the number of times players head the ball in football, particularly young players. It said there should be a set of consistent guidelines across all sports to ensure concussion is diagnosed promptly and the player appropriately treated. Dr Grey said there is new evidence coming to light showing the need to be concerned but it is a ‘difficult issue’. Dr Grey added: ‘Our challenge is that because it is such a difficult issue. We know some people are very susceptible to getting head injuries in these situations and some are quite resilient and we don’t know why yet.’ He said parents and coaches need to be educated about secondary concussion syndrome and guidelines need to be followed. He added: ‘In essence we need to protect players from themselves.’","Children’s neck muscles not developed enough to handle shock of impact .

NHS figures show the number of children aged between 10 and 14 treated in hospital after deliberately hurting themselves has surged by 2,700 since 2012 . Experts reacted with alarm at the figures, revealed by The Times newspaper. Lucie Russell, director of campaigns and media for the charity Young Minds said the online world that children were growing up in fuelled self-harm. She told The Times: ‘This has never happened before. It is the pressures of the modern world and some of these pressures are unprecedented.’ Ms Russell said the 24/7 online culture left young people living in the ‘constant present’. Pressures on teenagers such as bullying, sex and school work had existed before but ‘the online world is relatively new’. She added: ‘It is uncharted territory.’ Young people feel a constant pressure to portray a certain lifestyle on social network sites, describing the perfect body and the right amount of friends. ‘Online they create a brand – brand me – which says I have loads of friends and this is how I look. They feel the need for constant reassurance and there is no privacy any more,’ Ms Russell said. The online world has also created a new space for bullying. She said: ‘In the old days you might get bullied at school but you could go home and shut the door.

"A New York woman has been indicted for collecting more than $47,000 in Medicaid benefits while living a luxury lifestyle of mansions and fancy cars. Hasime Lika, 34, is accused of hiding her assets to claim state benefits for herself and her children through Medicaid, a program that provides help to New Yorkers who can't afford medical care, between 2006 and 2011. All the while, prosecutors claim, she was living in a $2.4 million mansion in the Todt Hill area of Staten Island and driving around in a Rolls Royce and a Mercedes. Indicted: Hasime Lika is accused of claiming more than $47,000 in benefits fraudulently . Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes says Lika used her maiden name to file for benefits and claimed to live in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Hynes says Lika generally uses the surname of her common-law husband Bill Lika, a wealthy property owner who owns 14 rental properties in New York and has assets of more than $5 million. According to ABC, Hasime Lika's name is on the deed to the $2.4 million mansion she and her husband bought without a mortgage in 2007, just months after she filed for benefits. Opulent: Lika lives in this Staten Island mansion, and not in Brooklyn's Williamsburg as she claimed when filing for benefits, say prosecutors . The house has a three-car garage, a pool and a large fountain in the front yard. Lika also had $35,000 in her checking account that she failed to declare at the time she applied for benefits for herself and her children, say prosecutors. They also allege that when re-certifying her Medicaid applications between 2006 and 2012, she never disclosed her relationship with Bill Lika. 'This case is an egregious example of an individual who lied to the system by hiding income and a plethora of luxurious resources to abuse one of New York City's most vital public benefit programs meant to serve those truly in need,' said HRA Commissioner Robert Doar in a prepared statement. Wealthy: Lika refused to answer questions as she left the court and ran to dodge reporters and photographers . Lika is charged with welfare fraud and grand larceny. If convicted, she faces up to seven years in prison. Local area blogs and YouTube videos allege Bill Lika is a 'slumlord' whose apartment buildings are in a 'third world' condition, while a Twitter user posed in March, 'My landlord Bill Lika sued me, and I won. No hard feelings, Bill (you sad disgusting piece of filth).'

"Google Glass could become an integral part of medical care in the future and has already been credited with saving the life of one patient in the United States. Wearing a beefed-up version of the futuristic internet-connected visual aid, doctors in Boston were able to immediately access the records of a man with a severe brain bleed last January during the devices clinical trials. With the help of Google Glass, the physician at Beth Israel Deaconess was able to discover that because of his serious condition the patient had given an incomplete history and if they had administered much-needed drugs solely on that, he may have died. Scroll Down for Video . Future of medical care: Dr. Steve Horng sporting his Google Glass explained how physicians at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center are now using the device to save patients lives . The patient managed to tell doctors he was allergic to some blood pressure drugs - which they needed to slow the bleeding. Fast response: Dr. Horng used Google Glass to react quickly to a life-threatening situation a patient faced in January . However, the man didn't remember to tell them he was also taking blood-thining drugs - which when applied in combination could have been fatal. Using the Google Glass to pull up his correct medical information, doctors were able to give him the correct dose of medication and thereby save him faster than accessing paper records or those of a computer screen somewhere else. The life-saving story was first reported in the Boston Globe and is part of the Wearable Intelligence in Healthcare program in partnership with Google. The glass devices contain specialized software designed for use solely inside hospitals and medical care centers. The Google Glass has no access to social media or search engines and is only interconnected to the hospital Wi-Fi and physicians inside those four walls. At Beth Israel Daconess, all ER doctors will now don the space-age glasses when they begin work - which will hopefully one day become as routine as putting on their scrubs. Google Glass, which went on limited commercial sale last week in the United states, is considered the next possible frontier in mobile technology. Partnership: This is a grab from a promotional video for Wearable Intelligence - who have partnered with Google to provide the software for Google Glass . The frame contains a small eyeglass which has a small screen over the right eye which displays everything seen on a larger computer screen or smartphone. In addition to the screen, Google Glass has a high-resolution camera which can be used to video patients as they arrive for records or to display real-time footage to specialists or doctors who are not currently present. The device reacts to voice commands and the tech-giant hopes to retail Google Glass worldwide for up to $1,500. 'And not only is it hands free, it’s always on, always in front of you and always giving you information,' Dr. Steven Horng who is pioneering Google Glass in hospitals. 'Rather than having to excuse myself, it means I can quickly access that information without having to interrupt the patient, lose eye contact, or even leave the room,' said Horng to the Boston Globe. Real-time: A Google Glass equipped doctor in the future would be able to let another physician physically see a patient in another part of the hospital . Most importantly, despite being Google Glass, the Wearable Intelligence hardware have no access to Google's database or records. 'When we started this pilot, one of our caveats was we had to respect patient privacy and confidentiality,' Horng told CNBC's Squawk On the Street on Monday. 'It needed to meet all the requirements that our other clinical applications do.' Beth Israel and Wearable Intelligence plan to expand the hospital’s use of Google Glass in the near future. Additional uses could include using Glass for doctors to consult with each other remotely. 'Surprisingly, the patients have been very very open to it,' said Horng. 'If anything, they have been very intrigued and like 'what's on your head?'","Doctors at Beth Israel Deaconess utilize Google Glass to access correct medical records of seriously ill patients faster .

"Defeated: Charles Saatchi with his new girlfriend Trinny Woodall . When he successfully blocked a neighbour’s plans for a huge basement conversion, Charles Saatchi thought he had reason to celebrate. But now the multimillionaire advertising tycoon has suffered a triple blow. For not only has the neighbour been given permission for a scaled-down version of the project but two other residents in the exclusive Chelsea street have announced plans for basement conversions of their own. Saatchi, 71, faced allegations of hypocrisy when he and his then wife Nigella Lawson objected to the original plans three years ago. The couple had just spent a fortune turning their £12.3million property into a seven-bedroom dream home. They were given planning permission to rebuild large parts of the former gas engineering works and dig a basement conversion. They spent £500,000 on the kitchen, used as a studio for Miss Lawson’s TV cookery shows in 2010. However, when interior designer Flora Mascolo, who had bought the property next door, applied to carry out renovations, Saatchi objected. He claimed turning the £5million two-storey house into a four-storey property by means of a large basement conversion would ‘erode the character’ of the street just off the fashionable King’s Road. Mrs Mascolo, 46, the widow of Toni & Guy hair salon chain founder Guy Mascolo, accused the couple of using their celebrity status to turn residents against her after more than 20 objected. However, another resident said: ‘If you own a house that is worth a lot of money, you don’t want to see the value diminish by what is happening next door.’ The mother of four shelved her plan but submitted an amended application. That was withdrawn following further opposition. Mrs Mascolo submitted a third, scaled-down application in January, which was passed. Building started this week and two more owners have now applied for permission to convert their basements. Exclusive area: Saatchi's home in Chelsea and his neighbour's house on which building work is being done . Miss Lawson, 54, moved out last year when her marriage to Saatchi ended seven weeks after photographs emerged of him with his hands around her neck during an argument at a restaurant. Saatchi and Nigella Lawson spent a fortune turning their property into a seven-bedroom dream home . Saatchi has since been dating TV fashion presenter Trinny Woodall, 50. Nick de Lotbiniere, of Savills, who acted for Saatchi over the planning row, said: ‘The project in question has now been considerably scaled down, and improved in design from the original unsuitable proposals. ‘Conditions were also imposed on the project to safeguard the local environment as the result of the reasonable and successful objections of the local residents.’ Kensington and Chelsea Council plans a crackdown on ‘iceberg homes’ – where owners dig down several levels. Draft rules would limit basements to a single storey.","Saatchi and ex-wife Nigella objected to neighbour's basement conversion .

Police say the Melbourne taxi was rear ended by a Toyota Corolla at Brighton East at around one oclock, Sunday morning.The 13CABS driver, a 65 year old man from Aspendale Gardens, was then struck by a Mitsubishi Colt and crushed between two cars whilst exchanging details . Police say the taxi had two passengers at the time of the collision and there were three occupants, including the driver, in the Toyota. Only a female passenger in the Corolla was taken to hospital for minor injuries. Police say the driver of the third vehicle, a 46 year old man fled the scene on foot. A search, including airwing and sniffer dogs, was conducted shortly after but police were unable to locate the driver. Superintendent Neville Taylor said it was a minor collision that became one of three serious crashes overnight.

'Here we are again on a Sunday, cleaning up the mess, cleaning up the carnage,' he said. Simon Purssey from 13CABS said the taxi driver's death has shocked the company. 'When something does happen, a tragedy like this for the industry, it happens and it affects everybody from the drivers to the contact centres to operators, family and friends and staff,' Mr Purssey told ABC News. He said the man had about 10 years' experience driving taxis. 'The driver was experienced, doing his job at night and all of a sudden he's not here with us anymore, it's a tragedy.' Police have again reminded drivers that high risk behaviour costs lives after a taxi driver was killed in a hit and run whilst exchanging details with another driver in a minor collision . 13CABS also posted an article of the crash on their facebook page and urged anyone to help if they could.

"Ariana Grande has hit back at reports she left an Australian photo shoot in a huff on Tuesday, saying she actually went to change her clothes because she didn't like her top. Speaking to Mike E and Emma on 96.1, the 21-year-old popstar called the claims 'untrue'. 'It was just a photographer who got mad at me because I left to change my outfit mid photoshoot because I didn’t like my top,' she told the radio show.  'I was like, ""Oh I’ll be right back!"" and I came back and he had left.' Scroll down for video . The young star has been in the spotlight since she was 14 - as an actress in two Nickelodeon TV shows and with her music career. Ariana Grande has seemingly brushed off the controversy that followed her diva antics at a photo shoot on Monday with an energetic performance on morning television for her screaming fans . She's a confident performer: Ariana seemed to put on a playful show for the fans watching her in the window . Ariana was rumoured to have stormed off from her first photo shoot in Sydney on Monday after giving photographers an endless list of demands and telling journalists they couldn't ask certain questions. But she said a simple costume change was all there was to it. '[The photographer] said all these ridiculous untrue things about me,' she said. Weighing in was Justin Bieber's manager and Ariana's professional associate, Scooter Braun. Speaking up: Talent manager Scooter Braun - who discovered Justin Bieber - spoke out in support of Grande . Hotel hello: From her hotel window in Sydney she blew a kiss to her fans and gave a quick wave on Tuesday afternoon despite the controversy . 'That’s not real. That’s nonsense. 'My fans know who I am, my family know who I am, my friends know who I am. 'No matter what you do, no matter what your profession is, no matter how old you are, everybody deals with haters.' Talent manager Scooter Braun, who discovered and managed Justin Bieber as well as Ariana, also weighed in. Ariana performed her hit song Problem in a black one-piece paired with thigh-high boots and a pair of cat ears perched atop her head . The American singer is currently in Sydney to promote her album My Everything . Following her performance she spoke to the show's hosts Sam Armytage and David Koch as she kept an eye on her screaming fans outside the studio . Ariana, who confirmed she would tour Australian next year, said she had been looking forward to coming here for a long time . Her antics didn't seem to phase her or the hundreds of adoring fans that turned up to see the popstar as she performed live on Channel Seven's Sunrise program at Sydney's Martin Place early on Tuesday morningAriana, who is in Sydney to promote her album My Everything, performed her hit song Problem in a black one-piece paired with thigh-high boots and a pair of cat ears perched atop her head. Following her performance she spoke to the show's hosts Sam Armytage and David Koch as she kept an eye on her screaming fans outside the studio. 'I've been looking forward to coming to Australia for a long time - I haven't had enough time though,' she said. The American star, who collaborated with Iggy Azalea on Problem, also said she's a huge fan of the Australian rapper. 'I love Iggy, she's very talented I love her music and I was honoured that she wanted to do a song with me.' Just a day earlier Ariana was reportedly displeased with the way she looked on camera and she stormed out on a string of media commitments scheduled to promote her new album. The first photographer of the day had been handed a list of demands, including 'only to shoot the left side' of Ariana's face, and not to use 'natural light.' Media were also handed a no-go list, guiding the  line of questioning, according to news.com.au. The list reportedly stated that Miss Grande could not be quizzed about topics including her love life, Mariah Carey, Justin Bieber and her recently-cancelled Nickelodeon program, Sam & Cat. Ariana's entourage then sent the rest of the snappers home empty-handed even though photographers and journalists had been left waiting in a hotel room for an hour. The popstar eventually re-appeared to answer questions wearing a short navy and gold sequined skirt and black top. When asked if she had any plans to work with Australian rapper Iggy Azalea again, her collaborator on global hit Problem, she replied: 'I just put out this album, slow down a little... I'm just kidding.' The young star has been in the spotlight since she was 14 - as an actress in two Nickelodeon TV shows and with her music career. Ariana stopped to get photos with as many fans as she could outside the studios at Martin Place in Sydney . 'I love Iggy': The 21-year-old opened up about Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, who she collaborated with on her hit track Problem . Ariana said she works hard to protect herself from negative comments. 'I've made it so I don't really have to deal with it. I've sort of created a very safe happy little bubble that I live in where I don't really hear about those things, or look at them, or read them or see them for that matter,' she said. And it seems she attempts to stay in this bubble. 'I've tried to make a very definite separation between my real life and, then, that other stuff. So I don't really let that into my bubble, for lack of a better analogy,' she said, flashing a nervous smile at her entourage. 'I feel like that's the safest route.' Ariana was reportedly displeased with the way she looked on camera and she stormed out on a string of media commitments scheduled to promote her new album . The young star has been in the spotlight since she was 14 - as an actress in two Nickelodeon TV shows and with her music career. Grande recently performed on the MTV Video Music Awards, collaborating with Jessie J and Nicki Minaj on the song Bang Bang. All the focus was on Minaj who spent the time on stage clutching her dress to her body having experienced a reported 'wardrobe malfunction'. Grande claims to have liked this supposedly off-the-cuff moment for the rapper. 'That's a true star. I mean you just go ""OK, I'm naked, let's go."" She killed her verse, she carried on and she went home and celebrated,' she said.","Reports say Ariana Grande stormed out of an Aussie photo shoot after ONE photo .

"The contents of the seven-word text message, together with images of an obese woman, which led to rugby star Kurtley Beale being stood down from the Wallabies has been revealed. The message, which Beale reportedly sent to some teammates and, accidentally, to former team business manager Di Patston was contained in a letter sent by the Australian Rugby Union to Beale, in which they asked for an emergency meeting with the player. The letter, reportedly sent on Wednesday, referenced two messages containing photographs of 'extremely obese women', one with the message 'Di - who wants a go f***ing this?' The Sunday Telegraph reports. Scroll down for video . Di Patson, left, was copied into a message sent by Kurtley Beale in June and has become subject of an ARU investigation . Wallabies coach Ewan McKenzie has defended his relationship with Ms Patston, with whom he  worked at the Queensland Reds . Kurtley Beale (left) allegedly sent the offensive text messages  in June. A susbsequent row between Beale and Ms Patston led to McKenzie (right) driving the then team business manager to the airport so she could leave the tour early . The text message is alleged to have been a reference to Ms Patston, who resigned from the Wallabies on Friday following weeks of bad publicity and after a highly publicised row between her and Beale during a flight. The ARU letter contains the electronic signature of ARU General Counsel Richard Hawkins, according to The Sunday Telegraph. It reads: 'I refer to my earlier conversation with your manager, Isaac Moses, in relation to the distribution by you of texts which contained photos referencing ARU employee Di Patston. The texts were distributed in June this year. We received them from Ms Patston yesterday. 'The texts are not attached to this letter as, understandably, Ms Patston is extremely sensitive about them being circulated electronically. 'But as you will be aware: two of them contain photos of extremely obese women: one is accompanied by the caption 'Di', the other by the caption 'Di — who wants a go f****ing this?' They are followed by a number of other texts where you apologise to Ms Patston for circulating them. Mr Hawkins wrote the ARU considered the distribution of the texts a breach of the ARU Code of Conduct and requests a meeting with Beale and his manager which they later declined. The matter is now likely to see Beale's Wallaby contract, which expires at the end of the year, terminated at a code of conduct hearing. Beale, 25, was also reportedly involved in a verbal altercation with Ms Patston while travelling with the team before the side's loss to Argentina . The controversy dates back to a mid-air confrontation on a flight from South Africa en route to Argentina, where the Wallabies were due to play, last month. After the incident, coach Ewen McKenzie abandoned a Wallabies training session in Buenos Aires to drive his distressed business manager to the airport so she could fly home early. Ms Patston has been on indefinite sick leave ever since. An ARU spokeswoman confirmed on Saturday that Ms Patston had quit due to stress relating to recent events. Beale is facing the axe, not only over the alleged midair incident but also over allegations he circulated the offensive text messages about Ms Patston. It's believed some players had become disillusioned by Ms Patston's role in the team and McKenzie's reasons for hiring her. McKenzie hit back on Friday, insisting his relationship with Patston has always been professional and therefore did not compromise his position as coach. 'I've got a professional relationship with her. And I refute (suggestions of an intimate relationship),' he said.","Kurtley Beale is said to have sent two messages to teammates in June .

"Pope Francis has laid the groundwork for another of his predecessors to move towards sainthood after he approved a miracle. Just weeks after the canonisation of John XXIII and John Paul II, he has officially confirmed a miracle credited to prayers made by Paul VI by a pregnant woman who feared losing her baby. A date has now been set for beatification, the last formal step before possible sainthood. Pope Paul VI pictured in June 1963 after his election. Pope Francis has now approved a miracle credited to the intercession of Paul VI and set the date for the late pontiff's beatification for October 19 . One miracle is required for beatification, and traditionally a second for canonisation. The . Vatican, as is its custom, has not given details about the miracle . which must be certified by doctors as having no medical explanation. But . Italian media have reported that the miracle was that of a boy born . healthy in California despite the diagnoses in 2001 of the rupture of . the fetal bladder and absence of amniotic liquid. The mother reportedly refused an abortion and prayed for Paul VI's intercession at the urging of a nun. The baby was born a month prematurely and is now a healthy adolescent, the news reports said. President Kennedy, pictured left,  at the Vatican in an audience with Pope Paul VI, right, on July 3, 1963 . During his pontificate from 1963 to 1978, . Paul made landmark progress in improving Catholics' relationship with . other Christians. But he disappointed many Catholics who were hoping for liberalisation of church teaching on sexuality. After . much consultation and, reportedly, personal anguish, Paul VI enshrined . the church's teaching against artificial contraception in the 1968 . encyclical 'Humanae Vitae' ('of human life'). The . issue is among many expected to get scrutiny in a special meeting of . bishops called at the Vatican in October to discuss family life. The . beatification ceremony would come at the end of the gathering. Pope Francis, pictured left, has approved a miracle credited to the intercession of Paul VI, right and set the date for the late pontiff's beatification for October 19 . Like John Paul II, Paul VI was hard to peg as progressive or conservative. Both were conservative on sexual issues, but enthusiastically embraced the thrust toward ecumenism set in motion by the Second Vatican Council. Vatican II opened the way for Mass to be said in local languages instead of in Latin. Its reforms also inspired many nuns, especially in the United States, shed their long robes in favor of knee-length skirts and abandoned the head-coverings that were their orders' dress code for centuries. Paul, who like John Paul took up traveling to distant lands, ended nearly a millennium of estrangement between Catholics and Orthodox Christians when he journeyed to Jerusalem in 1964 and embraced Patriarch Athengoras, then the Orthodox leader. Pope Paul VI salutes a crowd estimated at 200,000 in March 1964, as he is carried on portable throne through St. Peter's Square in Vatican City . Paying tribute to that gesture, Francis later this month will go to Jerusalem and pray together with the current Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew I. Paul VI disposed of many of the privileged trappings of the papacy, anticipating Francis' disdain for stuffiness and fanciness at the Vatican. Paul got rid of scores of Italian nobles from the papal 'court' who had privileges dating back centuries. He still allowed use of the papal throne, and looked frail and uncomfortable as he arrived for the funeral of assassinated Italian politician Aldo Moro in Rome in 1978 in the chair perched on the shoulders of 12 men. He was under fire from the Moro family who thought he didn't do enough to save the leader despite having made a public plea 'on my knees' for Moro's release by Red Brigades kidnappers. On April 27 this year, Pope Francis proclaimed two other 20th century predecessors, John Paul II and John XXIII, the Catholic Church's newest saints as almost a million pilgrims flocked to the streets of Vatican City. It was the first time that two popes had been made saints at the same time.
