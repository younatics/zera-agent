Citizenship: Adolf Hitler was given honorary citizenship of Dietramszell in Bavaria back in 1933 . A small town in Germany has tried and failed to revoke the honorary citizenship awarded to Fuehrer Adolf Hitler back in 1933. The vote by the councillors in the town of  Dietramszell in Bavaria - the state where Nazism was born - is an embarrassment that shows the sneaking admiration that some in Germany continue to harbour for the dictator 68 years after his death in Berlin. Thousands upon thousands of communities in Germany fell at Hitler's feet when he became Fuehrer and Chancellor, giving him the keys to the city, sending him gifts and making him an honary dignitary. To this day an average of five municipalities a month delve into their archives, see that the mass murderer is still on their books and then vote to remove him. Mayor Leni Gróebmaier thought it was about time Dietramszell did the same after town hall archivist Agnes Wagner found Hitler was still a top dog in town dating back to March 1933, the month he came to power. The nearby town of Münsing carried out a similar vote a few days earlier which passed without discussion.  But the town councillors of Dietramszell refused to fall into line. 'It would be a distortion of history, the whole debate is laughable,' said council member Traudi Fröstl. Another member Josef Hauser said: 'Honourary citizenship goes with death. It is all a very long time ago.' And a third council member asked: 'Can we not distance ourselves from living politicians? That would be much wiser.' In the end eight councillors voted to kick Hitler off the VIP list, and eight voted to keep him. German media had a field day at the town's expense. 'It doesn't get more stupid than this,' said local governor Josef Niedermaier. 'Fascism is too important a topic for stupid political games.' 'Honorary citizen': Dietramszell in Bavaria - the state where Nazism was born - has Hitler as an honorary citizen .","Vote by the councillors in the town of Dietramszell in Bavaria .

Prosecutors demanded yesterday that Briton Andrea Waldeck be jailed for 16 years for smuggling drugs into Indonesia. But the former police support officer, 43, could still face the death penalty if judges decide to hand down a harsher sentence. Waldeck admitted trafficking 3lbs of crystal meth worth £3,000 last year on a flight from China. Her guilty plea could result in a similar shock sentence to the one given to British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford, 57. Seeking solace: Andrea Waldeck reads the Bible as she waits for her trial inside a court room, in Surabaya, Indonesia, today . She is appealing for clemency after being sentenced to death for admitting smuggling drugs into Bali. Yesterday, Waldeck sat in the court in . Surabaya in a prisoner’s red bib for three hours listening to the . evidence via an interpreter. She . claimed she carried the drugs, hidden in her underwear, after being . threatened by a male friend. Waldeck made no public comment yesterday. But on January 6, she will go back to the court and plans to make a statement  pleading for leniency. The . judges will then announce their  sentence. Indonesia has some of the . toughest anti-drug laws in the world and carries out executions by . firing squad. Miss Waldeck, who at an earlier . hearing had pleaded guilty to the smuggling crime in order to avoid a . mandatory death sentence, sat in a bright red prisoner’s bib as a . prosecutor outlined the case against her. He told how police had raided her Surabaya hotel room and found the drugs in black bags that had been hidden in her underwear. As . well as demanding the 16 year sentence, the prosecution asked that Miss . Waldeck’s laptop computer be confiscated and the suitcase that had . carried the drugs be destroyed. Hard time: Andrea Waldeck, center, of Rustington, Surrey, is escorted out of a holding cell by a police officer and a prosecutor after her trial hearing at Surabaya District Court in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia, today . Crime and punishment: Andrea Waldeck, center, is facing 16 years in an Indonesian jail and a £100,000 fine after admitting smuggling drugs . In addition to the 16 years, . prosecutors want her to serve, they asked the judges to fine her two . billion rupiahs - or £100,000 - or if she fails to pay that, to serve a . further six months imprisonment. The case was adjourned until January 6 . when Miss Waldeck will be able to speak in her defence in the hope of . winning a reduced sentence. Police . and narcotics officers had been told Miss Waldeck was carrying the . drugs and waited until she had checked into the three star hotel before . raiding her room. They found the drugs in black plastic bags that she had previously packed in her underwear to pass through customs. A court official who has been helping . her through Indonesia’s complicated legal system told the Mail that Miss . Waldeck had intended travelling to Indonesia from her base in China to . try to set up a furniture import-export business. Threats: Andrea Waldeck, left, claims a Nigerian acquaintance threatened to kill her if she did not smuggle the drugs into Indonesia . But . she has told officials that a male Nigerian friend in China had . threatened her if she did not agree to carry the crystal meth to . Indonesia. She said he had told her: ‘I’m Nigerian. You know about Nigerians. We kill people.’ Miss . Waldeck is alleged to have told lawyers that she received no reward for . carrying the drugs, but agreed to undertake the risky operation because . of the threats she had received.

There are no guarantees that she will escape the death sentence. British woman Lindsay Sandiford, who admitted smuggling drugs into Bali, heard Prosecutors ask for her to be jailed for 15 years - but the judges,  in a shock verdict, handed down the death sentence.

Kingpin: David Smith who ran a drug trafficking gang like a 'set of marionettes' while building a £1million property protfolio has been jailed for 11 years . A secret millionaire who set up a cocaine trafficking gang which he treated like 'a set of marionettes' has been jailed for 11 years. David Smith, 41, exploited his team of dealers and couriers while living a life of anonymity in his £120,000 suburban semi in Stockport. As his lieutenants mixed, prepared and transported drugs, Smith was covertly building a £1million property portfolio and a stash of cash. After building a network of safe houses, his gang did his dirty work before he picked up the profits at the end of each deal. Police in Stockport, Greater Manchester compared him to a puppeteer who kept his team 'at his beck and call.' He was arrested last October following a year-long police operation culminating in a series of raids at 12 different addresses in Stockport and one in North Wales. Huge bundles of cash including one wad of £380,000 was seized from one address, a further £150,000 was seized from a second and £7,000 from a third. Seven kilograms of cocaine with an estimated street value of £681,402 was also recovered. Police also confiscated several cars, including a BMW X5 and a Renault Laguna. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Smith, from Stockport, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and money laundering and now faces a Proceeds of Crime Application to seize his money. Eight of his gang, all from Stockport, were jailed for a total of 43 years. Det Insp Steve Earnshaw, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Over the course of several months, we pursued these men with a dogged determination to unravel their activities and establish who the main runners and riders were. 'David Smith was clearly at the top of the tree, operating the others from above like a set of marionettes that he had at his beck and call to do his dirty work for him. 'They were dealing in large quantities of drugs and cash. The stakes that they were playing for brought them high rewards but they now realise that the consequences too are high.' Keeping under the radar: Smith built his drugs empire while living in a modest £120k semi in Stockport (left). He is pictured (right) at one of his safe houses which he set up so his gang could mix and package the drugs . Stash smashed: These bundles of drugs were found in the extractor hood above the cooker at one of the properties raided by police last October . Illicit product: Drugs recovered after the arrest of two gang members. In total, seven kilograms of cocaine with an estimated street value of £681,402 was seized during the raids . Complex operation: The drugs would, through a network of safe houses, be packaged and delivered to street dealers and addicts through a well organised network of mobile couriers . Police said Smith was the 'key man' of . the operation, who would source high purity cocaine in kilogram amounts . from drug-trafficking contacts. The . drugs would then, through a network of safe houses, be packaged and . delivered to street dealers and addicts through a well organised network . of mobile couriers. The drugs would be cut with the mixing agent Benzocaine in an effort to maximise profits. Once . the drugs had been mixed and prepared for sale, individual 'dealer . packs' were provided to the street dealers who would then collect the . money which was then given to Smith. Large hoards of cash would be kept at safehouses and drugs would be pressed into hard blocks. Ill-gotten gains: Huge bundles of cash including one wad of £380,000 was seized from one address, a further £150,000 was seized from a second and £7,000 from a third . Hidden hoards: huge sums of cash would be kept at safe houses and drugs pressed into hard blocks . Cataloging the evidence: Police notes written on drug stashes detailing where they were seized . Philip James, 34, and 25-year-old Dixie Dean who both mixed and prepared the drugs for sale were jailed for six and a half years and six years respectively. Couriers Gary Cantwell, 51, and Craig Ryder, 28, and street dealer Scott Whelan, 28, were each jailed for six a half years. Fellow dealers Chris Clayton, 28, and Keiran Murray, 26, were jailed for four years and four and a half years respectively. Trevor Whitehead, 52, who ran a safe house was jailed for three years. All eight men admitted conspiracy. Det Insp Earnshaw added: 'Dealing drugs in any quantity carries significant risks if caught, but when we look at the size of this operation it is only right that the sentences reflect what was a million pound enterprise. Lieutenants: Philip James (left), 34, and 25-year-old Dixie Dean (right) who both mixed and prepared the drugs for sale were jailed for six-and-a-half years and six years respectively .

'I must reserve special credit for the investigating officers who presented such overwhelming evidence for what was an extremely complex investigation that all nine men had no other option but to admit their guilt. 'Now the criminal process is over we will be using the laws available to us to strip Smith of any and all the assets accumulated from his illegal endeavours. 'Cocaine abuse, like other drug abuse, is a major factor in a lot other acquisitive crime such as theft, burglary and robbery, which people turn to in order to feed their habits. 'It is also a factor in violent crime, fuels gang violence and organised crime and in real terms can and does impact on the day to day lives of local residents. 'Smith and people of his ilk are not bothered about this. They are not bothered about the effect the drug has on individuals, the effect it has on the community at large or the victims of crime the abuse leads too.

"By . Stewart Maclean . UPDATED: . 10:35 EST, 11 October 2011 . The Archbishop of Canterbury shared tea, scones and jam with Robert Mugabe as he confronted the dictator over the persecution of Anglicans in Zimbabwe. Dr Rowan Williams urged the tyrant to call a halt to a campaign of terror which has seen thousands of the country's Anglicans forced out of their churches and abused. Sitting side-by-side in high-backed velvet armchairs, the pair then drank tea from fine bone china cups as they discussed politics and religion during an unprecedented 90-minute meeting at Mugabe's official residence in Harare. Talks: The Archbishop of Canterbury meeting Zimbabwe's president Robert Mugabe at the State House in Harare . Meeting: The dictator leads Dr Rowan Williams by the hand during the controversial visit . REVD PETER MULLEN: Rowan Williams is allegedly in Zimbabwe to protest about the treatment of Christians by the Mugabe regime. But, instead he delivers the oxygen of publicity by his visit. Williams constantly reminds me of a line by the great 20thC poet C.H. Sisson, ‘In the presence of folly, I am not sanctified, but angry.’ Read more here . The pair were then seen shaking hands at the end of the meeting. The Archbishop later described the . meeting as a ‘real exchange' of views and said the Zimbabwean leader was . shocked by the scale of persecution of Anglicans. He said: ‘It was a very candid meeting, disagreement was expressed clearly but I think in a peaceable manner. ‘We have asked him that he use his . powers as head of state to guarantee the security of those of his . citizens who worship with the Anglican church and put an end to . unacceptable and illegal behaviour.' Yesterday's meeting with Mugabe was the centrepiece of the Archbishop's two-day trip to Zimbabwe. On Sunday he launched a stinging . attack on the president's regime during a sermon in Harare, delivered to . 15,000 of the country's Anglicans. Evidence: Dr Rowan Williams presented President Mugabe with a dossier compiled by the bishops in Zimbabwe giving a full account of the abuses suffered by Anglicans . Attack: Dr Rowan Williams told Zimbaweans in a powerful message yesterday that they deserved better than to live under his reign of terror . The strongly worded rebuke sparked fears Mugabe may seek to embarrass Dr Williams by declining his request for an audience. However the Archbishop said his comments were not even discussed when the pair met yesterday. Instead Mugabe allowed his British . visitor to present a dossier detailing the abuse of Zimbabwe's Anglicans . before lecturing him on British meddling in the former colony. Dr Williams later said the tyrant, who . is a Catholic, claimed to have been shocked at the level of persecution . of Anglicans in his country. He said: ‘He expressed his concern at the damage the division was doing to communities generally in Zimbabwe.' The Archbishop's visit was the first time for a decade that a senior British dignitary has met with Mugabe. Some critics warned the meeting risked . becoming a propaganda coup for the tyrant, who has become an . international pariah after presiding over years of human rights abuses. However Dr Williams last night said he was ‘deeply glad' he made the trip. Some 75 per cent of Zimbabwe's . population describe themselves as Christian, with Anglicans making up . the largest single denomination. Contentious: Mr Kunonga was excommunicated from the Anglican Church after inciting violence in his sermons supporting Zimbabwe's long-time President Robert Mugabe . Protests: Member of an Anglican church supporting Zimbabwe's Bishop Nolbert Kunongas hold anti-homosexual placards . Controversy: The demonstrators march against the visit by the Archbishop of Canterbury . Their mistreatment stems from a . rupture in the Anglican Church following the 2008 sacking of Bishop . Nolbert Kunonga by the Province of Central Africa, after he complained . the church was too soft on homosexuals. Anglicans obedient to his replacement, . Bishop Chad Gandiya, say Konunga – a fervent supporter of Mugabe – has . since been allowed to wage a campaign of intimidation against them with . the protection of the police. Dr Williams also spoke of the church's determination to improve conditions in Zimbabwe for Anglicans. He added: ‘We want strongly and . unequivocally to support the efforts of ordinary Anglicans here to . worship in peace and to minister as they have for so many years to the . spiritual and material needs of their communities.' Demonstrators: Led by Bishop Nolbert Kunonga, the protesters make their feelings about Dr Rowan Williams' visit known as they arrive at the church . Mass: The Anglican spiritual leader greets the congregation at the City Sports Centre in Harare. He is planning to stay in the city for two days . Crusade: Followers of Bishop Nolbert gather outside St Mary's Cathedral in Harare . Aides to Dr Williams said his office believed his Zimbabwe trip had been a complete success. The controversial visit was organised as part of a week-long tour of Africa in which he last week visited Malawi. The Archbishop and his entourage are . due to depart Harare this morning for the final leg of their trip in . Zambia, before returning to Britain on Thursday.

The family of a 13-year-old California girl who was declared brain dead last week, three days after undergoing a routine tonsillectomy to cure her sleep apnea, are determined to keep her on life support indefinitely against the hospital's wishes. Speaking to CNN's Piers Morgan Tuesday night, Nailah Winkfield, the mother of Jahi McMath, said she believed her daughter could still wake up. 'I don't want to take my daughter off life support because I love my child,' an emotional Miss Winkfield said. 'When I walked her into that hospital, she was perfectly fine, there was nothing wrong with her. She had no health problems.' Loss: Jahi McMath, 13, suffered cardiac arrest after having her tonsils out and has been declared brain dead. The hospital will now switch off her life support, even though her family does not want to . The . mother recounted how when Jahi emerged from surgery to remove her . tonsils at Children's Hospital & Research Center in Oakland lastTuesday, the 13-year-old said her throat was hurting and she wanted a . Popsicle. 'I don't want . her off life support because I really feel like she can wake up,' Nailah . Winkfield told Morgan. 'I feel like it's just been a rough week for her . and, if they just give her some more time, then she'll be able to wake . up.' Jahi's family have . since presented the hospital with a cease and desist letter through . their attorney, Christopher Dolan, to prevent the teen from being taken . off the ventilator. 'Our . faith is so strong that we don't even think about the possibility of . death,' said Jahi's uncle, Omari Sealey. 'We believe with all the . prayers from everyone around the world and the prayers with our family . that she will wake up, that she will heal completely.' This afternoon, the 13-year-old girl's family and their attorney declared that the hospital informed them that Jahi would be kept on life support indefinitely, KTVU reported. 'The hospital has now backed off from the efforts to remove live support,' said Dolan. The family said if the hospital moves to switch off Jahi's life support again, they will take legal action to try to get a court injunction. 'We're not on doctor's time anymore we're on god's time, providing us more time to get together and pray,' said Sealey. However, experts told the station that no one has ever recovered from being brain dead, and that hospital officials are merely acting out of compassion by keeping the legally dead girl on life support. The . girl's family have created a Facebook page called 'Keep Jahi Mcmath on . life support,' which so far has drawn over 2,900 'likes.' Oakland . coroner's office told CNN that Jahi's death was reported to the agency . Thursday. Under California state law, pathologists are required to . examine the body as soon as possible and determine the cause and manner . of death. United front: Nailah Winkfield (center), Jahi's uncle, Omari Sealey (far left) and their attorney said they wanted to hospital to keep the girl on the ventilator indefinitely . In Jahi's case, . the fear is that the longer her body remains on life support, healing, . the more difficult it would be to uncover what went wrong during the . surgery, according to the official. However, . Mr Dolan, the family's attorney said that Jahi is a person, not . evidence, adding that it is a 'ruse' on the part of the hospital to try . and get the girl off the ventilator under the guise of an investigation . into her death. California law states that two doctors must declare a patient brain dead at least three hours apart. Before the doctors gave their decision to the family, Jahi's heartbroken mother said she had felt that the hospital was pressuring her into switching off her daughter's life support so that they could re-use the bed. 'They . just have a social worker follow me around all day long asking me ""Do . you have any other family that needs to see her?"" like trying to put a . rush on it,' Winkfield told ABC 7, breaking down. Chatman had added to the Oakland Tribune that . as long as her daughter's heart was beating, they wanted to keep her in the hospital, . even if it means spending Christmas in there. 'As long as she has a pulse, we want her on life support,' Sealey said. 'We want her to come home for Christmas. We want to give her presents. We want a chance for a Christmas miracle.' Apprehensive: Jahi was nervous about undergoing surgery but her mother assured her she'd be fine. As she was recovering, she was bleeding from the mouth and nose and suffered cardiac arrest . Beloved: Jahi's mother Nailah Winkfield said they had wanted to keep her on life support for Christmas . The tragedy unfolded after Jahi went to the hospital for the routine surgery meant to help with her weight gain, incontinence, short attention span and sleep apnea - even though she did not want to. Her uncle said she had told her mother 'something bad is going to happen to me'. The child's mother and . grandmother Sandra Chatman say hospital staff failed to provide adequate . care and attention to the clearly ailing patient. She underwent the surgery but as she was recovering she started to bleed profusely from her nose and mouth. 'My daughter had actual clots sliding out of her mouth and they gave me a cup and said, ""Here, catch them with the cup so we can measure them,""' Winkfield told ABC 7. Chatman, herself a surgical nurse, said nursing staff did not react until she began screaming for help. 'I was the last one to see Jahi,' said . Chatman. 'I said, ""Somebody help my baby, please!"" And they came in and . starting working on her. The next thing I know, the doctor said, ""Oh no, . she doesn't have a heart rate anymore.""' Investigation: Oakland Children's Hospital said it will investigate what happened after the surgery. As Jahi has been declared legally dead, she will be taken off life support . 'There was a lack of urgency,' Jahi McMath's uncle Omari Sealey said. 'It's shock, it's disbelief. You never think something like this will happen to you.' Jahi went into cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. She was given clotting medication to stop the hemorrhaging, but to no avail. She spent the following day, Tuesday, on a ventilator, but by 2am on Wednesday doctors said a CT scan has revealed that two-thirds of her brain was swollen. On Thursday, she was declared legally brain-dead, according to the Oakland Tribune. Spokesperson for Oakland Children's . Hospital said in a statement: 'We're very sad about this outcome, about . what's happened to her, but at this point I have no information on the . details of the surgery. 'We . will certainly investigate what happened. In any surgery there are . risks and there can be unexpected, unanticipated complications.'","Jahi McMath, 13, went to have her tonsils and adenoids out at Oakland Children's Hospital, California last week .

"By . Damien Gayle . UPDATED: . 19:50 EST, 3 March 2012 . Odds on: Vladimir Putin delivers a speech in Moscow on Friday. He is likely to sweep back into the Kremlin today with two-thirds of the vote . Moscow is on high alert for today’s . presidential election, which is expected to see Vladimir Putin return to . the Kremlin after a four-year absence. Polls predict that Mr Putin will . storm to victory – he is on course to gain 60 per cent of the vote – and . the security services are preparing a major clampdown on protests. Mr Putin’s nearest rival, veteran Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, is unlikely to secure more than 15 per cent of the vote. Victory for Mr Putin, 59, will . trigger a fresh round of opposition against what is seen as his . authoritarian methods and new complaints over vote-rigging. Demonstrators who poured on to the streets after December’s heavily disputed parliamentary elections are likely to return. Security officials say police in . Moscow are on ‘high alert’, with 34,500 officers in place today, and . more than 6,000 reinforcements due into the city to cope with expected . protests from tomorrow. Special forces troops will also be on . standby. Across the country, about 380,000 police will be on duty today . alongside 60,000 private guards. Russians were warned that officials will take tough action against any unauthorised mass protests around the Kremlin. Blogger Alexei Navalny, the . unofficial protest leader, called for a new round of peaceful action and . said the people would never consider Mr Putin a president with . legitimacy. He told the Associated Press: 'People in Russia are not going to recognize Putin's victory in the first round.' Another prominent protest figure, Ilya Ponomarev, a parliament member from the opposition A Just Russia party, said protesters' mood has become more truculent after authorities brushed off their demands for nullifying the results of the December parliament election. 'It has evolved from ""we demand a rerun"" to ""go to hell"",' he said. Last December opposition rallies attracted vast crowds, upwards of 50,000 in Moscow. State television gave them substantial and mostly neutral coverage. Mr Putin has repeatedly alleged that the protesters are stooges of the U.S. and Western European countries that want to undermine Russia. He has also insulted them, saying for instance that their white ribbon emblems looked like condoms. In the past week, the rhetoric became even harsher as Mr Putin publicly suggested the opposition was willing to kill one of its own figures in order to stoke outrage against him. That claim came on the heels of state television reports that a plot by Chechen rebels to kill Mr Putin right after the election had been foiled. Some of Mr Putin's election rivals dismissed the report as a campaign trick to boost support for him. Campaign: Two women push their pushchairs past a campaign billboard for Mr Putin reading : 'The Great Country -  A Strong Leader!' in Smolenks, some 480 km outside Moscow . Cult of personality: Portraits of Mr Putin, . which cost about 1,000 Roubles ($35) each, are on display at a book . store in St. Petersburg on Friday . Despite official hostility to . December's protests, they did force the government into some changes . aimed at making the electoral process more transparent. As . the first protests roiled the country, Putin announced an expensive . program to place two web cameras in each of the country's 90,000 polling . stations, one showing a general view and one focusing on the ballot . box. However, foreign electoral observers have cast doubt on their effectiveness. A . report on Russia's electoral preparations by an election observation . mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe . noted: 'Cameras cannot capture all the details of the voting process, in . particular during counting.' Along with the OSCE mission, tens of thousands of Russians have volunteered to be election observers, receiving training on how to recognise vote-rigging and record and report violations. In the December election, observers from the non-governmental group Golos reported being threatened and kicked out of polling stations. Hostility to the group among officials remains. In January, the head of the Federal Security Service in the Komi republic called the group 'extremists' inspired from abroad. Hugh Williamson of the international watchdog Human Rights Watch said in a statement: 'The Russian government has done the right thing by allowing unprecedented public protests and proposing some reforms.' But, he added, despite the positive developments, the climate for civil society is as hostile as it ever was.' Anger: Demonstrators take part in a mass anti-Putin rally on December 24, 2011 in Moscow, Russia. Tens of thousands of demonstrators rallied in cities across Russia to protest alleged vote fraud in parliamentary elections . Voices of the voiceless: A protester stands during a rally in downtown St Petersburg, Russia, Saturday, December 10, 2011. The sign reads 'No vote' In his past four years as prime minister - a sojourn he took because of a constitutional limit of two consecutive presidential terms - steely Mr Putin remained Russia's dominant political figure, overshadowing mild-mannered successor Dmitry Medvedev, who spoke often of reforms but accomplished little. Mr Putin has promised to appoint Mr Medvedev prime minister if he wins the presidency in order to pursue his reform ideas, but many regard Mr Medvedev as lacking the hard-edge political skills to be an effective reformer. In addition, appointing him premier could anger the opposition by echoing an earlier humiliation - the day in September when Mr Putin and Mr Medvedev told an obedient convention of the ruling United Russia party that Mr Medvedev would step aside from seeking a second term in order to allow Mr Putin to run. The decision, done without public input and presented as a fait-accompli, was widely seen as cynical and anti-democratic - even an analyst close to the Kremlin called it a 'filthy deal' - and contributed strongly to the growing disillusion with Mr Putin.","Pollsters predict Russian prime minister to win with two-thirds of the vote .

A new federal rule has prompted schools across America to serve an extra $5.4 million worth of fruit and vegetables to children each day, but that doesn't mean they're going to eat it. Infact, there are findings that suggest about $3.8 million of that produce will be thrown in the trash. However U.S. researchers suggest that paying students small amounts of money or handing out prizes in cafeteria increases the number who ate pieces of fruit and veg at lunch. What to choose? U.S. researches say small rewards offered in the lunchroom will increase the consumption of fruit and veg among children by 80 per cent . According to Breitbart, Scientists conducted a study to measure of such small rewards in the lunchroom by giving nickels, quarters and raffle tickets only to the kids who ate the healthy snacks on offer. The findings, published in The Journal of Human Resources, showed fruit and veggie consumption increased by 80 per cent, while waste food dropped by 33 per cent. Some 15 schools were canvassed for the study. 'Parents are often misguided about incentives,' said Joe Price, an economics professor at Brigham Young University and one of the study's researchers. 'We feel a sense of dirtiness about a bribe. But rewards can be really powerful in the activity creates a new skill or changes preferences.' Some fear prizes will prevent children from developing their own motivation to eat things that are good for them, while others fear the boomerang effect -- children eating less fruit and vegetables when the rewards disappeared, the researchers explained. Critics of the study findings say prizes will prevent children from developing their own motivation to eat things that are good for them . Price measured fruit and vegetable consumption before and after the week-long experiments. When the week of prizes ended, students went back to the same level of fruit and vegetable consumption as before - no lasting improvement, but no boomerang effect either, the study said. The researchers are studying whether extending the experiments over three to five weeks might yield lasting change. 'I don't think we should give incentives such a bad rap,' said Price. 'They should be considered part of a set of tools we can use.' The study was inspired by a new federal rule prompting schools across America to serve an extra $5.4 million worth of fruit and vegetables to children each day, in an attempt to make kids more healthy .","New federal rule prompted all American schools to serve an extra $5.4 million worth of fruit and veg each day .

Fans of the Comedy Central's comedian Nathan Fielder put their relationships on the line to take part in another cruel prank. Fielder, who recently encouraged teenagers to text their parents about a fake drug deal, took to Twitter on Wednesday to ask his 70,000 followers to send a message their partner saying: 'I haven't been fully honest with you'. In a cruel repeat of his drug deal prank, his followers were told to not respond to any texts or phone calls for one hour after sending the message. Cruel: Comedian Nathan Fielder encouraged his Twitter followers to text the person they are dating . What might have seemed a funny idea at the time, quickly backfired as relationships were destroyed and trust lost. David Pina was one of many who instantly regretted taking part in the prank. He later tweeted on Fielder's page: 'Thought it'd be funny but now I completely regret it. 2 years down the drain.' In a fit of anger, his now ex-girlfriend . berated and belittled him, before confessing that she 'Did hook up with . your best friend on New Years'. Demands: Many pleaded for more information, but the Twitter followers had been told to stay quiet for an hour . Acceptance: Some people took the cryptic message calmly, expressing a wish to 'end' the relationship well . One prank texter was ordered to 'find another place to sleep tonight', and several had their lives threatened by irate girlfriends. While nearly all jumped to conclusions, believing they had been cheated on, a few took the news better than expected.

Fears that the Syrian civil war is spreading into Lebanon grew yesterday after a rocket attack on Beirut. Two southern neighbourhoods of the Lebanese capital which are strongholds of Hezbollah were targeted. At least four people were injured. It came just hours after Hezbollah – a militant Iranian-backed Shia Muslim group – reaffirmed its support for Syrian dictator President Assad. Victim: A wounded man awaits medical attention after two rockets hit his house in Beirut's suburbs . Strike: Lebanese army soldiers investigate at a damaged room where a rocket hit  an apartment in Chiyah district, south of Beirut . The group’s leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, vowed to help Assad win the civil war and warned that his overthrow would give rise to extremists. Assad’s opponents are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslims and Lebanon’s sectarian divide mirrors that of Syria, with Lebanese factions taking sides in their neighbour’s civil war. One rebel leader has threatened to strike Hezbollah strongholds in retaliation for the group sending men to fight alongside Assad’s forces. The rocket attack came two days after Russia's foreign ministry said the Syrian government has agreed to a conference on the country's future proposed by Russia and the United States. A Lebanese man shows the remains of one of the rockets. Hezbollah supports President Assad, but Sunni opponents in Lebanon favour the Syrian opposition . Tensions have been running high in Lebanon, and Syrian rebels have threatened to retaliate against Hezbollah for sending fighters to assist President Bashar Assad's forces in Syria . The Syrian government had 'agreed in principle' to participate in the conference in Geneva which is expected within two weeks, Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said in televised remarks. Mr Lukashevich, however, said that it was impossible to set the date for the conference at this point because there is 'no clarity about who will speak on behalf of the opposition and what powers they will have'. Opposition groups have spoken against President Bashar Assad's representatives taking part. Blast zone: Lebanese security officials said at least four people were injured . Sectarian: A flag with an icon of Imam Ali, an important figure for Shia Muslims, is seen in front of a balcony where a rocket struck . A Lebanese army officer investigates part of a rocket which struck a car on the street in the Mar Mikhael district, south of Beirut . More than 70,000 people have been killed and several million displaced since the uprising against Mr Assad erupted in March 2011 and escalated into a civil war. It was the first confirmation that Mr Assad's government would be willing to take part in the talks with the opposition. But despite the announcement from Moscow, one of Mr Assad's staunchest allies, Damascus has not offered any definitive statement on the proposed talks. The US-Russian plan, similar to the one set out last year in Geneva, calls for talks on a transitional government and an open-ended ceasefire.

"By . Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 07:56 EST, 2 December 2011 . The North East has seen a 400 per cent increase in the number of hospital admissions for people in their early 30s with alcoholic liver disease (model) Consultants have called on the Government to introduce new curbs on alcohol advertising to protect young people. In an open letter they warned Britain is facing an epidemic of liver disease caused by a binge drinking culture and cheap booze. The North East has been hit particularly hard with figures showing a 400 per cent increase in the number of hospital admissions for people in their early 30s with alcoholic liver disease. The consultants are supporting a campaign by Balance, the north east of England's alcohol office, demanding a stop to the alcohol industry recruiting young people as the next generation of problem drinkers. Balance said children were 'swimming through 40% proof advertising' and were being encouraged to start drinking younger, and to drink more. In the open letter published in The Guardian the consultants, mostly liver specialists and gastroenterologists, blamed the problem on our having created 'an excessively pro-alcohol culture by selling alcohol for pocket money prices'. They said a decade ago it was unusual for a liver specialist to treat anyone for alcoholic cirrhosis who had not reached their 50s. 'Alarmingly, this is no longer the case. In the North East we are in the middle of an epidemic,' they add. 'It is clear we need to halt this epidemic in its tracks, otherwise we will soon be treating young men and young men and women in their 20s on a regular basis for a disease that is 100% preventable.' A spokesman for Balance said: 'It's time we said enough is enough. 'Our children are being bombarded by alcohol advertising which is encouraging them to drink alcohol at an early age - and in greater quantities. 'Early consumption is linked with a host of problems including brain damage, truancy, experimenting with drugs and unsafe sex. 'We don't think that it's normal for children to be bombarded by alcohol adverts while going about the business of being children.' Balance's petition demands a ban on alcohol advertising on television and non-18 certificate films in the cinema, as well as a halt to the sponsoring of sports and cultural events. The North East has the highest rate of 11 to 15 year olds drinking. This means they are more likely to be victims of crime, have unprotected sex, and under perform at school. Research by Balance showed North-East hospitals recorded 189 admissions for 30 to 34-year-olds with the disease last year, compared with 37 in 2002. In total, there were 778 admissions for 30 to 34-year olds with alcohol liver disease between 2002 and last year, costing the NHS about Â£1.8m. There were a further 482 admissions for under-30s, with some people admitted under the age of 20. In all, in the past eight years there have been 21,798 alcoholic liver disease admissions across the region, costing the NHS Â£51.7m. Dear editor . When it comes to alcohol and the liver, the general rule is that the volume and duration of consumption determines whether someone will have a problem. As recently as a decade ago, it was unusual for a liver specialist to treat anyone for alcoholic cirrhosis who had not reached their fifties.Alarmingly, this is no longer the case. In the North East we are in the middle of an epidemic. We have witnessed a 400% increase in the number of 30-34 year olds being admitted into our hospitals with alcoholic liver disease since 2002. This early onset is due to the fact that people are drinking at much earlier ages and in much greater quantities than ever before. The average adult now consumes just under 11 litres of pure alcohol each year, more than double the levels recorded in the 1950s. People are consuming in this way because we've created an excessively pro-alcohol culture by selling alcohol for pocket money prices, promoting it heavily and widely and making it available 24 hours a day. It's clear we need to halt this epidemic in its tracks, otherwise we'll soon be treating young men and women in their twenties on a regular basis for a disease that is 100% preventable. That's why we're supporting en masse a campaign which has been launched in our region by Balance, the North East alcohol office. It calls for Government to stop the alcohol industry recruiting our children and young people as the next generation of problem drinkers. By preventing the alcohol industry from reaching children and young people through TV, social networking sites, under-18 films in the cinema and sponsorship of sporting and youth events, we begin to make drinking early and in large quantities less normal and less acceptable. We begin to change the excessively pro-alcohol culture, which the alcohol industry spends an estimated Â£800m a year on marketing to sustain.

Fears were growing last night that the Woolwich attack was carried out by a home-grown Islamic terror cell far bigger than originally estimated. Over the weekend armed counter- terrorism officers arrested four young men within 24 hours on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. The dramatic daytime arrests by police wearing balaclavas means there are now six terror suspects being held over the death of Drummer Lee Rigby. Scroll down for MailOnline exclusive video . Police raided a flat in Greenwich where they arrested two men on suspicion of conspiracy to murder . These include Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, who remain in hospital under arrest after executing Drummer Rigby, 25, last Wednesday. Terrorism experts initially believed the attack to be the work of two ‘lone wolves’ who were not linked to any larger extremist group. Comparisons were quickly made between the Woolwich attack and last month’s bombing of the Boston Marathon, which was carried out by two terrorists. But the arrest of four more suspects raises the fear that a terror cell was operating in suburban houses in London. Armed officers wearing balaclavas arrested a man on a street Hnear Highbury Corner in connection with Drummer Rigby¿s murder . There are also concerns that other Islamic extremists could be lurking in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to strike. Peter Clarke, former head of counter terrorism at Scotland Yard, said that he believed Adebolajo and Adebowale were part of a bigger terror network. ‘Clearly these people this week weren’t lone wolves,’ he told Sky News. ‘We know that they associated with other people with a similar way of thinking and the thing is that underpinning everything they do, there is an ideology. ‘So when you are attacking a network, you are attacking an organisation or structure but when you’re looking at individuals, you have to understand how far they have been poisoned, how far their actions have been influenced by the pernicious ideology that violent extremism has.’ The potential existence of a terror cell may not have been spotted before because it did not plan a large attack like the failed airline bomb plots of 2006, experts said.

A husband has revealed how caring for his wife of 76 years through a long battle with Alzheimer's disease took a severe toll on his physical and emotional well-being. Reggie Gooch, 98, got up at 4am every morning for two years to make his beloved wife Millie breakfast - then stayed by her side until 10pm each night. Mrs Gooch died at the couple's home in Hollywood, California last month, leaving her husband suffering from compassion fatigue -  a condition with a variety of symptoms of secondary post-traumatic stress caused by caregiving. All-time love: Millie and Reggie Gooch were married for 76 years and he cared for his wife up until her death from Alzheimer's in Hollywood, California last month . Always by my side: Mr Gooch gave up all his pastimes to be available around the clock for his wife during her illness . Mr Gooch, who worked as a carpenter while his wife worked in real estate, told Good Morning America: 'The furthest I could get away would be the entrance hall to pick up the mail. I don't think I could have gone on much longer.' Although he had help from a part-time caregiver, Mr Gooch admitted that the strain of watching over his wife had a severe effect on his health. Before his wife fell ill, Mr and Mrs Gooch loved to garden and spend time with friends. In their younger years, they had traveled the world together. The Compassion Fatigue Awareness Project has been established to help caregivers who find themselves in position where they have to provide intense support for loved ones without any previous training. Natural beauty: Reggie Gooch had been married to Millie for 76 years and said they were always 'lovebirds' According to the organisation, when an individual focuses so intensely on another's needs to the detriment of their own it can result in apathy, isolation, bottled up emotions and substance abuse, along with many other symptoms associated with a secondary traumatic stress disorder.

Failures and flaws in the way barristers handle complaints against themselves are leaving  the public at risk, an investigation has found. A scathing inquiry from a state watchdog said that the Bar Standards Board – which regulates the elite of the legal profession – has failed to reach satisfactory standards in every area in which it operates. It said the findings raise a question mark over the legitimacy and legality of the complaints system. The strongly worded verdict from the Legal Services Board is a blow to the legal profession at a time when lawyers are trying to demonstrate the bodies through which they regulate themselves are working. Criticisms levelled at the BSB, which is run by barristers, include delays that see hundreds of complaints against lawyers unresolved for years – with some still unfinished after almost a decade. Two in three of those who complain to the BSB think they are treated unfairly, the investigation found. The charges come at a time of political controversy for the Bar Standards Board. Following the publication of the Leveson report, which calls for an end to self-regulation of newspapers and the imposition of Press regulation laws, it emerged that two of the barristers who worked on opposing sides during the Inquiry were having an affair. David Sherborne QC, who represented celebrities and others calling for state regulation of the Press,  and Carine Patry Hoskins, who represented the Inquiry, went for a break together to the Greek island of Santorini four months before the Inquiry ended. The pair have said they went on holiday to discuss the possibility of a future relationship, decided against it, but changed their minds later on. And Lord Justice Leveson rejected any suggestion that the Inquiry may have been compromised, and has said it is for the Bar Standards Board to settle a complaint from senior Tory MP Rob Wilson over the conduct of the lawyers. The BSB, which was launched seven years ago, has come in for repeated criticism. Nevertheless, last year its chairman Baroness Deech insisted it was in ‘rude health’. But the report from the Legal Services Board said one survey had found more than two thirds of people who complained to the BSB about the conduct of barristers thought its methods were neither open nor fair. The BSB, which polices the conduct of 15,000 barristers, ‘has very little evidence’ about the views of ordinary people who pay them, it found. However, user satisfaction surveys showed ‘a significant number of those that have had reason to complain about an individual regulated by the BSB do not consider the process open and fair’. The figure was 67 per cent, or two out of three complainants. During 2013, the Legal Services Board said, the BSB has been handling 316 complaints about barristers which date back to 2010 and 2011. There were a number of even older unresolved cases, with one going back to 2004. Lord Justice Leveson rejected any suggestion that the Inquiry may have been compromised . ‘Such delays are not fair to those regulated by the BSB who face such allegations for such a long period and raise risks to consumers who receive services from barristers who may be unfit to practise or need to undertake remedial action,’ the report said. The inquiry questioned the independence of the BSB because its purse strings are held by the Bar Council, the organisation which speaks for barristers. The Bar Council can reject any item of BSB spending, must approve any cheques for more than £1,000, and can veto staff appointments. The report said in some incidents the watchdog had ‘been concerned about the Bar Council’s attempts to fetter this independence’. It added: ‘Involvement of the representative body in regulatory matters raises risks to the legitimacy of the independent regulatory body’. It might also break the law, the report said. The inquiry also criticised the way the regulator operates through eight different committees with 130 members, adding the Legal Services Board ‘does not believe that it can deliver effective or efficient governance’. The Bar Standards Board currently claims that by the end of 2013 ‘the term BSB-regulated will be an assurance of good, honest, independent advocacy and expert legal advice’. However, the Legal Services Board said the BSB had in reality promised only to achieve satisfactory grades in all areas by the spring of 2016 and that even this task was ‘ambitious’. It said some improvements would need ‘culture change’ and in other areas the BSB ‘has painted an overly optimistic picture about the progress it has made’. BSB director Dr Vanessa Davies said: ‘The report praises the BSB’s self-assessment and progress in this area while identifying areas for improvement. She added: ‘Like any organisation that serves the public – and this one does so at no expense to the public – we want to improve constantly. ‘We welcome the fact that the LSB agrees with how we have analysed our progress so far and how we are going to continue to modernise. 'We know that is ambitious and tough: but we also know that the public deserves no less.’","An inquiry has said the Bar Standards Board has failed to reach satisfactory standards .

Squeezing a person's leg after they have suffered a stroke could save their life, according to new research. Experts found that wrapping a compression device around the legs of a stroke patient could reduce the risk of blood . clots, which often result in death. Compression reduces the risk of clots in the veins of the legs by increasing blood flow. New research shows that gentle compression of the leg after a stroke could reduce the risk of  deep vein thrombosis, which commonly affects stroke patients . The results of the trial, carried out by Edinburgh University, revealed that intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), implemented by an inflatable leg wrap, reduced the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which commonly affects stroke patients. DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism, which blocks patients' blood vessels in their lungs and can cause heart failure, killing thousands of people each year. The study, tested more than 2800 stroke patients in hundreds of hospitals across the UK. It shows that the wraps can reduce the chances of death when they are worn for several days or weeks after the stroke. The necessary IPC wraps, costing the NHS £25 per pair, are inflated for a few seconds, one leg at a time, to compress the veins in the legs every minute or so. Until now, no treatment has been available that safely reduces the risk of the blood clots in the legs. Until now, there have been limited treatments to cut the risk of dangerous blood clots in stroke patients . Current treatments include blood thinning injections, which have been shown to reduce the risk of DVT, but these carry an increased risk of bleeding on the brain. Experts also believe blood thinning injections are not conclusively shown to reduce the risk of dying after stroke. Around 15 million people suffer a stroke each year worldwide - one third of whom will die. Another third will become permanently disabled. It is the second most common cause of death worldwide. Professor Martin Dennis, of the University of Edinburgh's Division of Clinical Neurosciences, said: 'At last we have a simple, safe and affordable treatment that reduces the risk of DVT and e . ven appears to reduce the risk of dying after a stroke. 'We estimate that this treatment could potentially help about 60,000 stroke patients each year in the UK. If this number were treated, we would prevent about 3000 developing a DVT and perhaps save 1500 lives. 'We believe that the national guidelines need to be revised in the light of our findings. 'The current national guidelines have suggested that IPC should be considered only where blood thinning injections are unsuccessful or inappropriate, but this research suggests that IPC should be used in all patients at high risk of DVT.' Dr Dale Webb, Director of Research and Information at the Stroke Association said: 'Following a stroke, the risk of developing blood clots and DVT increases considerably which can be extremely dangerous for the patient. 'At the moment some stroke survivors receive anti-blood clotting medication, however this isn’t effective in everyone. 'This new device has the potential to save thousands of lives and we would like to see it incorporated into national clinical guidelines.' The findings were published in the Lancet.","Study revealed that compression reduced the risk of deep vein thrombosis .

Brian Witty, 41, a former Territorial Army captain with the Parachute Regiment, was convicted of raping three women and sexually assaulting another over 16 years. He met two of the women on the website DatingDirect.com, the other two after chance encounters in pubs. Three were raped after being invited back to his flat  and the other was sexually assaulted in an alley near Covent Garden, central London. After the convictions yesterday, it was revealed Witty had been found guilty of assaults on the mother of his 17-year-old son and a previous girlfriend. The court heard that Witty, who drove an Aston Martin and earned around £140,000 a year, could be sentenced to life imprisonment for ‘public protection’. On his internet profile on DatingDirect, Witty described himself as ‘intelligent, attractive, witty and fun to be with’, and added: ‘I enjoy meeting like-minded intelligent, humorous individuals (females only please!) who want to have some fun/sparkle in their lives.’ Once his dates were arranged, powerfully-built Witty would typically ply his victims with drink before forcing them to have sex. When they begged him to stop he ‘steamed on regardless’ and afterwards would pretend nothing had happened. When his first victim rebuffed his sexual advances, he leapt out of bed and said: ‘I can’t believe this. I’m a good-looking bloke.’ Edmund Gritt, prosecuting, said: ‘The prosecution’s case is Witty does not take no for an answer.’ Attempting to explain why four women who had never met would all accuse him, Witty, of Teddington, South-West London, said he had no idea, other than that two of them might have ‘a screw loose’. He added: ‘I really do believe that my mistake, if any mistake, is one of thinking with my d*** and then you know I’m paying for it later.’ After a five-week trial, a jury of eight women and four men convicted Witty on three counts of rape and one sexual assault. Smile of a predator: This photo was used by Brian Witty on his dating website profile . Shame of a disgraced rapist: Another picture Witty used online to attract women . Judge Nicholas Price QC told Witty at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court: ‘It is inevitable that you will be sentenced to a very long term of imprisonment. ‘The only issue that this court has to decide is whether your behaviour is such as it has been over a period now of many years that you should be considered to be dangerous, and liable to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for public protection.’ Police and prosecutors came under fire from women’s groups because Witty’s attacks covered 16 years before he was stopped, despite three women reporting that he had raped them. The prosecution said Witty 'did not take no for an answer' Women Against Rape said: ‘The trial has shown, once again, that with serial rapists police and CPS have a serial response – they believe the rapist rather than his victim.’ Police appealed for other women to come forward who think they may have been attacked by Witty. City watering hole: Abacus, a bar on Cornhill, next to the Royal Exchange in the Square Mile, where Witty claimed to have made eye contact with an alleged victim as she ate chicken 'suggestively' His father Brian senior, who separated from Witty’s mother Yvonne, said: ‘I don’t know where it all went wrong with Brian. He was always a very clever lad, but he knew it. He thought I was an a*******. Even as a young lad he would look down on me because I was a labourer. ‘He is the type of person who, if you didn’t do what he wanted you to do, you would know about it.’ A clue to Witty’s hatred of women may be found in his ‘tumultuous’ relationship to his mother. His father said their rows sometimes led to ‘fistfights’. She died of an alcohol-related condition in 2004. Dating Direct: Witty met another victim through this online matchmaking service .

For more than 100 years the dome of the Capitol building in Washington DC has stood as a proud marker for American democracy and success. But now it is due to be covered over with scaffolding as the first repairs to it since 1960 begin to fix the 1,300 cracks in its cast iron shell. And, unlike some of the politicians below, the builders above will have to work fast as the $60million construction project is scheduled for completion just before the next Presidential inauguration on January 20, 2016. Scroll down for video . Under construction: Work is due to start on a $60million project to repair the dome of the US Capitol Building which now has around 1,300 cracks in its cast iron shell . Blame the birds: Roosting birds have created holes in the dome which has allowed water to leak in causing damage to a lot of the paintwork . Removed: During the work decorative sections of the dome including some of the floral displays will have to be taken away in order to be repaired elsewhere . Water damage: The Apotheosis of George Washington fresco in the centre, painted by Italian artist Constantino Brumidi, has also been damaged by rain . Stephen Ayers, the Architect of the Capitol, said: 'A dozen years ago there were 300 and some cracks, a few more years there were 500 cracks, then 900 cracks, and now 1,300. Now is the time to intervene and make sure it's preserved for generations to come.' The hugely complicated project will involve removing several floral displays and pillars to be taken away for repair, while the 290ft high dome will be patched and made watertight. Workmen will have to remove up to 13 layers of lead-based white paint in order to get to the 14.1million pound iron structure below which has been damaged by centuries of rain and roosting birds. Paint job: Workmen will have to chip away up to 13 layers of lead-based paint before they are able to get at some of the damaged cast iron underneath . Crumbling: The cornerstone of the old building was laid in 1793 by George Washington himself during a day of celebrations in the American capital . Rusted: Work was finished in 1826 thanks to the work of five architects, but more building began in 1850 as congress expanded along with the nation . In fact birds are the reason the . condition of the dome began being monitored again after water leaked . through a hole made by a nesting bird and on to the rotunda floor during . a storm. Modern building techniques will . hopefully ensure that the current restoration survives longer than the last effort, as Mr Ayres revealed that welding completed between 1959 and 1960 has already failed. The cornerstone of the building was . laid in 1793 by George Washington himself with great pomp and ceremony, . and was then worked on by doctor and part-time architect William . Thornton who placed a shallow dome between the North Senate wing and the . South House wing. Conflict: much of the early work on the Capitol Building was destroyed when British troops set fire to it in 1814 . After hours: Work to repair the 14.1million pound dome will take place mainly at night so as not to disturb congress who will carry on working below . Faulty: Stephen Ayres, Architect of the Capitol, says that welding that took place during the last restoration has already failed and will need to be fixed . Construction . then crawled along under the watchful eye of several different . architects before much of their work was undone by British soldiers in . 1814 who set fire to both the Capitol building and the White House. Fortunately . a rain storm stopped the building from being completely destroyed and . construction was eventually 'finished' in 1826. While scaffolding . will cover some of the outside of the dome during the repairs, the fresco Apotheosis Of George Washington will stay on display as a doughnut-shaped . safety net will be set up around it. As it was: While the early Capitol featured a dome, it was a shallow structure between the two wings and nowhere near as grand as the one that stands today . Expanding: Architect Thomas U. Walter was tasked with expanding the building in 1850 as the growth of the nation was reflected with a growth in congressmen and senators . Crowning glory: The cast iron dome was added during the construction which included an expansion of the grounds around the building . The . whole site will be illuminated with bight lights as most of the work . will be carried out at night so as not to disrupt the work of congress. However building work continued to . enlarge the Capitol from 1850 and it was architect Thomas U. Walter who . designed the cast iron dome to sit between new enlarged chambers, with . work finishing in 1868. The massive fresco inside the dome was . painted by Italian artist Constantino Brumidi and consists of a portrait . of the nation’s first president rising to the heavens flanked by the . allegorical figures of Liberty/Authority and Victory/Fame. High point: At its tallest point the dome stands at 290ft with the whole of Washington DC visible below it including the George Washington monument . Historical: Construction work on the building started in 1793 but was halted in 1814 when British troops set fire to it along with the White House . Tight schedule: Work is due to finish just before the next Presidential inauguration which will take place on January 20 2016 . Off limits: While the dome itself will be obscured from view during the work, the main fresco will remain visible thanks to doughnut shaped scffolding . They are surrounded by maidens representing the first thirteen colonies and around the perimeter, on the ground below, six groups of figures depict War, Science, Marine, Commerce, Mechanics, and Agriculture. Maintenance of the modern-day Capitol Building falls to the Architect of the Capitol who is appointed for a ten-year term by the President and approved by the senate. The Architect is responsible for the maintenance of all all of the Congressional office buildings, the Library of Congress buildings, the United States Supreme Court building, the United States Botanic Garden, and the Robert A.Taft Memorial. Work on the Capitol Building began in 1793 as the cornerstone was laid by George Washington as part of a day of celebrations. A string of architects then took up the job of completing it, including Stephen Hallet, George Hadfield and James Hoban who completed the Senate wing in 1800. Benjamin Henry Latrobe was hired in 1803 nd by 1811 he had renovated the Senate wing and completed the House wing. However much of their work was wasted in 1814 when British troops set fire to the building, along with the White House, which were only saved by a rain storm. Eventually building work was 'finished' in 1826 by Charles Bulfinch, but as the nation and the government expanded it became necessary, in 1850, to start extending the structure. It was during this period of building, from 1850 to 1868 that Thomas U. Walter added the large cast iron dome that sits on top of the building today. He also extended both the North and South wings, adding new legislative chambers and expanding the grounds. In 1897 the Library of Congress moved out of the Capitol into its own building, making space for new committee rooms. In the 20th century, separate buildings were constructed to provide offices and committee rooms for the House and Senate. The Supreme Court moved into its own building in 1935. Today’s Capitol complex includes the Capitol, six major House and Senate buildings, three Library of Congress buildings, the Supreme Court Building, the U.S. Botanic Garden, and other facilities. The latest new project was to add the visitor centre to accommodate some of the millions of people who come to see the Capitol Building every year, and it took from 2001 until 2008 for it to be completed. The last restoration efforts happened between 1959 and 1960 and the latest work is expected to take to years, finishing just before the 2016 Presidential inauguration. The building and its grounds are maintained by an architect who is appointed by the President and approved by the senate for a 10-year term.","Dome of Washington's Capitol Building in desperate need of repairs after damage caused by weather and birds .

A top solicitor shouted 'I'm a fucking lawyer and you can't stop me' when he was told he was too drunk to catch a train, a court heard today. Roger Harris, 67, then called railway worker Euan Cameron a ‘Scottish a******’ when he confronted the lawyer at a station in the City of London. Harris, a partner at property specialists Bower Cotton Khaitan, had drank three glasses of wine at the Old Bell in Fleet Street after his train was cancelled. Harris had three glasses of wine at the Old Bell on Fleet Street, London . When he returned to City Thameslink last January 29 to catch a later service he was denied entry to the platforms. ‘Mr Cameron believed for his own safety he shouldn’t be travelling,’ said prosecutor Shazia Ahmed. ‘He advised him to go and sober up. Mr Harris responded by saying, “I’m a f***ing lawyer and you can’t stop me” and trying to push past him.’ The two began struggling and Harris then struck out at Mr Cameron, pushing him in the chest. The lawyer was turned back as he tried to board a City Thameslink train home . The lawyer continued hurling insults as he was detained and arrested, at one point telling the victim he was a ‘Scottish a******’. He added: ‘Do you know what I do with a******* like you? I will roll you up and throw you out. I’m a f***ing lawyer.’ Harris was arrested at the scene and . kept in a police cell for seven hours until he was released in the early . hours of a January night this year. Mr Cameron said: ‘It left me feeling shocked. I absented myself from work the day after the incident.’ Harris asked for his case to be heard at the Old Bailey, where he admitted assault by beating. He was cleared of a more serious charge of racially aggravated assault after prosecutors offered no evidence. Judge Charles Wide QC fined him £350 and ordered him to pay £100 compensation and £85 court costs. He said: ‘This was utterly disgraceful. ‘There you are, a 67-year-old man of good character and good standing, under the influence of drink. ‘People doing public service, as Mr Cameron was, deserve the protection of the courts and will get it.’ Jonathan Gold, defending, said: ‘He’s a person that has been very successful in life and not a person prone to this. 'He called Mr Cameron every name under the sun and one of them happened to refer to where he was from.’ The Old Bailey heard how Harris called the railway worker a 'Scottish a*******' 'There was no affect on Mr Cameron at all. It’s very much an petulant push rather than any serious intention to cause any harm.' He asked for the judge to impose a lenient sentence because he claimed the lawyer earns just £2,000 a month. Harris, from Ardingly, Haywards Heath, West Sussex, admitted assault by beating. He was found not guilty of racially aggravated common assault - a charge he denied - after prosecutors offered no evidence.","Roger Harris, 67, called railway worker Euan Cameron a ‘Scottish a******’

Murderer Mark Bridger boasted to friends 'I know where to hide a body' in the months before he killed five-year-old April Jones. Bridger - jailed for the rest of his life for the killing - was described by his former friends as a loner who was fascinated by serial killers. The ex-slaughterman, 47, has refused to reveal what he did with the schoolgirl's remains after she died, claiming he cannot remember. Scroll down for video . 'I know where to hide a body': Mark Bridger (right), convicted of killing April Jones (left), boasted that he knew the best place to conceal a body after a killing . April's parents Coral and Paul Jones yesterday begged Bridger to reveal what he did with her body. Bridger's friend revealed the oddball killer would often camp alone near his home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, with only a crate of super strength lager Special Brew or cider for company. They told The Sun that Bridger regularly liked to discuss where he would conceal a body. 'He did know the woods and hills around here very well because he'd spend all his time in the wild,' they said. 'He'd say stuff like ""this area here or there would be real good for getting rid of a body"".' The friend added that he wasn't surprised when Bridger was arrested. The murderer was described by Mr Justice Griffith Williams at Mold Crown Court yesterday as a 'pathological and glib liar' as he was given a rare whole life sentence. Murderer: Dressed in a green and yellow jumpsuit, Bridger is led from Mold Crown Court in handcuffs yesterday after being given a rare whole life tariff . The friend added: 'He was a very strange guy. Sometimes he could be mild-mannered and well-spoken. Then he'd talk about serial killers and concealing corpses.' Bridger also used to boast about being in the Special Forces and would wear camouflage gear. But residents in the market town did not believe his bizarre claims about his army past and knew he bought his kit from the local market. The oddball killer also liked to discuss some of the world's most infamous serial killers - including Jeffrey Dahmer, a cannibal who murdered at least 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. He also talked about Dennis Rader who murdered 10 people in the US between 1974 and 1991. He was known for leaving the signature BTK - which stood for 'Blind, Torture, Kill' whenever he struck. When police searched Bridger's cottage they found that he had been watching a brutal rape scene from the 2009 re-make of the slasher film, The Last House on the Left. Caught: This is the moment child-killer Mark Bridger is taken into the police station for the first time after being arrested for the murder of five-year-old April Jones . The lies begin: Bridger, 46, was arrested on October 2 as he walked along a road on the outskirts of Machynlleth, wearing a camouflage jacket and waterproof trousers, the day after April's disappearance . Distancing himself from a horrific crime: Prosecutors said Bridger 'relentlessly spun a web of lies and half-truths' ever since he was first interviewed by police . He had recorded the scene where a young teenage girl is raped by the leader of a gang in front of his watching gangmates, some of whom help to hold the victim down while she is being attacked. Police then discovered that the murderer recorded the rape scene for a second time when the film was repeated on a +1 channel an hour later. A former friend claimed that the killer was a big fan of the Saw films and 'watched them all the time'. They also claimed that Bridger . regularly stole power tools from homes being refurbished or building . sites before selling them on.

A female boxer who stole £20,000 of gold jewellery from her own mother to pay for tattoos has been spared jail. Kirsty Foord, 23, was living with her mother Zena in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, when she stole the 'irreplaceable' items and pawned them for cash, a court heard. The 4ft 11in former plumbing student - who made headlines last year when she fought off a would-be mugger who tried to steal her iPod - pocketed a little over £2,000 in exchange for her mother's valuables, which she then spent at a nearby tattoo studio. 'Sentimental value': Kirsty Foord, 23, stole £20,000 worth of gold jewellery from her mother and pawned it to pay for alcohol and tattoos . Foord was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison suspended for two years at Maidstone Crown Court after admitting the theft. The court heard Foord stole gold rings, bracelets, necklaces and earrings - many of which were of sentimental value - in 'dribs and drabs' between September and November last year. She then took the items - some of which were inscribed with the names of Zena Foord's children - to Wessex Fine Jewellers and Pawnbrokers to be melted down. 'Worried': Zena Foord ordered her daughter to move out of their home in Tunbridge Wells when she realised she had been stealing from her . Foord spent the £2,277 she received on a string of tattoos at the Regal Ink Tattoo Studio, which is just yards from the pawnbrokers, including a dragon on her torso, stars on her forearm, and an inking of her brother's name; Kyle. James Nichols, prosecuting, told the court: 'Zena Foord was worried, saying Kirsty had stolen from her before. 'She restricted her movements in the house and only allowed her to live downstairs (but) on November 24 she turned up to find Kirsty was upstairs.' The court heard how Zena Foord ordered her daughter out of the house after realising she had been stealing her jewellery - which she said cost at least £20,000 - telling her 'never to return'. The prosecutor added: 'There are items of great sentimental value to the victim. 'Some of them had the names of all her children on them and it's all been melted down and gone forever, and can never be replaced. 'The defendant said she spent the money she got being tattooed at a local shop.' The court heard how the listing from the pawnbrokers for the jewellery sold to them read 'various gold items..£2,277'. Judge Philip Statman told Foord: 'This theft had a profound effect on your mother. 'She has lost items of considerable value. Sadly, the property has been melted down. And she has lost the relationship with you.' Tattoos: Kirsty Foord pawned the jewellery for cash and spent it on getting tattoos including this dragon  on her side . Suspended sentence: Former plumbing student Foord also had an inking of the name Kyle . Foord, who pleaded guilty to the theft, was sentenced to 18 weeks in jail, suspended for two years. Writing on her Facebook page after sentencing on Wednesday, Foord said: '18 weeks suspended for two years - I'm so lucky.'

A woman who was so embarrassed by her weight she wore Bridget Jones control pants for eight years has managed to shed a third of her body weight - and finally throw them away for good. Jo Tinsley, 29, was so embarrassed by her size that she even wore spanx tights under her pyjamas in a desperate bid to give her a more shapely silhouette. But after embarking on a strict diet, Jo has shed an impressive four stone, . shrinking from a size 16 to a size eight - and is finally confident . enough to throw out the Bridget Jones knickers. Jo Tinsley dropped from 12st 7lbs (left) to 8st 7lbs (right), after eight years of wearing spanx day and night . Even after almost a decade of squeezing into shape control spanx, 5ft 2in Jo, from Wrestlingworth, Beds, tipped the scales at 12st 7lb - giving her a BMI of 32, making her medically obese. Jo said: 'I used to feel so frumpy and miserable, I'd got to a point where I was so miserable about the way I looked I was barely leaving the house. 'I discovered spanx and then I started wearing them obsessively - I wouldn't go anywhere without a pair on, hoping that it made me look a bit slimmer. 'One evening I was sitting at home in my pyjamas, and I still had my control pants on underneath, and I realised how ridiculous the situation had got. 'The only people who could see me were my parents, but I felt so disgusting that I couldn't even sit around in my own living room without feeling uncomfortable. 'I never dreamed I'd be able to lose the weight, but 18 months on, I'm thrilled that I'm finally the real me.' Jo spent almost eight years yo-yo dieting, trying dozens of fad diets and religiously wearing her control pants, but failed to shift the pounds. Jo was so uncomfortable with her body she even wore her spanx under her pajamas (left) but now she has dropped the weight (right) she has found the confidence to throw the control pants out . But when she noticed that a colleague had lost weight with the Cambridge Weight Plan - which initially restricts dieters to limited meals, replacing them with shakes and soups - she decided to give it a go. Jo said: 'I'd always been unhappy with my size, and I was badly bullied at school. 'Some girls once started a rumour that I was pregnant. It was so humiliating, but I just turned to food for comfort. 'When I was 21, I went on a weekend break with my mum to Ireland, and I packed loads of clothes to go out in. But when I came to get changed, I realised how awful I looked, and I couldn't bear to go anywhere. 'My mum went out and bought some tummy-control pants for me, so I felt a bit more comfortable - and from then on, I was hooked. 'I wore them all the time, to the point where I didn't feel comfortable going anywhere without them. 'I tired every diet going to lose weight, but I could never stick at them. Jo says starting the Cambridge diet and losing four stone has got her addicted to healthy eating and she now wants her story to inspire others to change their life . 'I'd manage a few days, or a couple of weeks, and lose a few pounds, but then I'd cave in and the diet would go out of the window and the spanx would go back on. 'The worst diet I tried was a lemon, water and cayenne pepper diet that Beyonce was doing - I didn't even last a day. 'I never thought I'd manage to stick to a diet, but one of my friends from work lost loads of weight on Cambridge. 'I liked that I had a set diet every day, and I didn't have to worry about counting points or calories, so I gave it a go. 'I had a one-on-one counsellor from the diet plan too, who helped me keep going when it got tough. 'But the weight started falling off straight away - and I was hooked on healthy eating!' A year and a half after starting the diet, Jo now weighs 8st 7lbs - and has finally thrown out the Bridget Jones pants. She added: 'I've even inspired my dad to start the diet too - he's lost almost as much as me. 'I want to let other people out there who are struggling with their weight know that it is possible to change your life - if I can do it, anyone can.'","Jo Tinsley, 29, from Wrestlingworth, Beds, shed 4 stone on Cambridge diet .

Overdose: It was revealed Thursday that Florida megachurch Pastor Zachery Tims died from an overdose of cocaine and heroin when he was discovered dead in a New York City hotel room two years ago . New York medical examiners revealed today that the Florida megachurch leader and father of four discovered dead in a Times Square hotel room two years ago died from a cocaine and heroin overdose. The cause of death in Pastor Zachery Tims' death wasn't revealed until today, following his mother's failed legal battle to keep the autopsy results a secret. Tims founded the 7,000-member New Destiny Christian Center in Apopka, Florida with his then-wife Riva in 1996. According to the Orlando Sentinel, the church built a $3.4million 34,000-square foot building in 2005, complete with a youth center. But . Tims life took a turn in 2008 when his wife of 15 years filed for . divorce, citing 'multiple and repeated extramarital sexual affairs'. Following the divorce, he even briefly stepped down from his position to deal with his personal 'indiscretions'. Tims . used his past of crime and drug abuse often in his sermons, and even . wrote a book about his troubled youth called 'It's Never Too Late: How a . Teenage Criminal Found His Divine Destiny and Became a Successful . Millionaire and Pastor of a Thriving Church'. But . Tims surprised his congregation when his body was discovered by housekeepers on August 12, 2011, looking to clean his room at the W Hotel in Times Square, New York City. His death was quickly suspected to be an overdose when police found a packet of white powder in his pants pocket. Megachurch: Tims started the New Destiny Christian Center with his then-wife in 1996. The church has 7,000 members who attend services in a $3.4million 34,000-square-foot building . Backslide: Tims spoke candidly about his past of crime and drug abuse and even penned a book about his troubled youth (left). Housekeepers found his body in his room at the W Hotel on August 12, 2011 . Break-up: Tims is pictured with his ex-wife of 15 years, Riva. The former Mrs Tims filed for divorce in 2008 citing her husband's multiple extra-marital affairs . Tims' friends and family were seemingly unaware of his relapse, and said they didn't even know what he was doing in New York at the time. Ex-wife Riva told Ebony magazine that she knew about his past drug abuse, but didn't know he was still using. 'I . had no idea it was so much.

He was one of the prime-time stars of 80s television with his clean-cut comedy routines and impressions. But Bobby Davro was left appalled rather than entertained when he tuned in to watch fellow comedian Jimmy Carr this week. Within hours he took to Twitter to vent his disgust at the content of Being Funny on Channel 4. Foul mouth: Clean-cut comedian Bobby Davro (right) was left appalled when he tuned in to watch Jimmy Carr (left) this week, taking to Twitter to express his disgust . Davro, 55, who became a star with ITV . shows including Bobby Davro on the Box, claimed that ‘standards have . dropped’ after watching Carr’s performance. ‘I can’t believe the joke he told to finish his show,’ he said. ‘I’m sorry but it’s beyond bad taste. Go and see a good panto with comedians that can make a whole family laugh without resorting to foul language. Innuendo not puerile filth!’ He wasn’t the only one to find Carr’s gags a turn-off. Scores of viewers reached for the off switch mid-way through the show despite it being screened after 10pm on Wednesday. Offensive: Some of Jimmy Carr's 'less crude' jokes . Carr poked fun at the blind, the death of Princess Diana, homosexuals and children, and made a tasteless Holocaust joke. The show was from his performance at a . club in Birmingham and Vivienne Pattison, of pressure group . Mediawatch-UK, said the public reaction highlighted how content for a . comedy gig was not necessarily suitable for TV – even after the . watershed. ‘When you’re in a . club you have to prove that you are 18 or over,’ she said. ‘When it’s . on TV that’s not the case. It’s offered for public presentation and . there is no way of knowing what is going to be included. ‘The fact that people turned off does show this is not what they wanted to see.’ Standards: Davro, 55, who became a star with ITV shows including Bobby Davro on the Box, claimed that 'standards have dropped' after watching Carr¿s performance . Tasteless: Carr poked fun at the blind, the death of Princess Diana, homosexuals and children, and made a tasteless Holocaust joke . Davro fell out of favour as taste in comedy changed – a point he touched upon during his rant at Carr. ‘We all love a good dirty joke but I’m sorry I would never dream of telling ones so offensive as Jimmy’s,’ he said. ‘I can’t believe that TV allows such filthy material. Why is it so popular to use every expletive going? Standards have dropped.’ Davro’s career downturn coincided with a troubled personal life, including a divorce said to have been caused in part by his desire to get back in the big time. It is a position he has never regained, and this year he will be starring in pantomime in Plymouth. Bad taste: Bobby Davro tweeted his disgust at the show . Filth: Davro said comics did not need to resort to foul language . Dropped standards: Davro said he could not believe what was allowed to be shown on television . Davro admitted to a certain envy over Carr’s earnings, but has no wish to follow his path. ‘I wonder if I started to tell jokes like Jimmy Carr that would make me more popular. If I did I think I would be lynched,’ he said. ‘Jimmy Carr is a great comic but I can’t understand how he can tell filthy sexist jokes and be thought of as brilliant.’ Lynched: The comic mused over whether he should tell jokes like Carr . Riches: Davro admitted to a certain envy over Carr's earnings, but has no wish to follow his path . He found support on Twitter, with fellow users describing Carr as ‘insensitive’, ‘offensive’ and ‘so over the line, it’s unreal’. Carr, 41, host of quiz show 8 out of 10 Cats, was criticised by the Prime Minister last year when his use of a controversial Jersey-based tax scheme was revealed. It led to him apologising and withdrawing from the scheme. TV watchdog Ofcom and Channel 4 confirmed they had received a handful of complaints about Being Funny, which had 780,000 viewers. A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘This was a repeat of a Jimmy Carr stand-up show, which featured his established brand of humour and was broadcast in a late-night slot. It was preceded by a continuity warning for strong language and adult humour.’","Bobby Davro left appalled when he tuned into a Jimmy Carr stand-up show .

Jailed: Music teacher Philip Evans rigged up a hidden camera to film himself sexually abusing boys at a top private school . A music teacher who rigged up a hidden camera to film himself sexually abusing boys has been jailed for three years and eight months. Philip Evans, 38, committed the 'disgusting' offences while also secretly capturing dozens of indecent images of pupils using changing rooms at one of the country’s leading private schools. Birmingham Crown Court heard Evans, who hid one of several cameras inside an electrical box, was arrested in August after an indecent photograph of a sleeping boy was found during a dawn raid on his home. Follow-up inquiries uncovered around . 350,000 indecent images on computers belonging to Evans, including more . than 100 recordings of pupils using changing rooms and a storage area at . King Edward’s School in Edgbaston, Birmingham. Some . of the footage, found on a laptop and a desktop computer, showed the . teacher committing sexual assaults as he pretended to measure seven . teenage pupils. Evans, of . Warwards Lane, Stirchley, Birmingham, pleaded guilty to six counts of . voyeurism, seven of sexual assault, and nine charges relating to . indecent images. Opening the . facts of the offences, prosecutor Aliya Rashid said recording . equipment, including a hi-tech security camera imported from America, . had been used to film boys in various states of undress. Evans, . who acted as an RAF 'leader' in the Combined Cadet Force at the school, . captured some of the images on a camera he attached to a bench inside a . shower block during a school trip. Miss . Rashid told the court: 'The offending spanned four years and much of it . was executed with covert recordings set up meticulously for the . defendant’s own sexual gratification.' On . one occasion, Evans entered a shower area at 4am to set up equipment . and could be seen testing that it was working, said Miss Rashid. Trusted: Evans was a music teacher and acted as an RAF 'leader' in the . Combined Cadet Force at King Edward's School in Edgbaston, Birmingham . Passing sentence, Judge Peter Carr described the offences - except one committed at Evans’ home - as a gross breach of trust. As . Evans remained composed in the dock, Judge Carr told him: 'All of this . behaviour by you was repulsive, disgusting and deceitful. 'Parents of pupils and pupils themselves should expect a school is a safe environment. You have made this environment unsafe.' Hoard: Evans had amassed 350,000 indecent images of children over four years . The . judge acknowledged that Evans’ career was over and his reputation in . ruins, but said it was 'obvious' from the material recovered that the . offences were carried out over a prolonged period of time. Speaking . after the case, Detective Chief Inspector Chris Hanson, head of the . Child Online Safeguarding Team at West Midlands Police, said: 'This was a . distressing and incredibly complex case to investigate. 'Our absolute priority throughout all of it was protecting children at the school. 'Evans, who has no previous convictions, had amassed 350,000 indecent images of children over four years and my team had the deeply disturbing job of analysing those sickening images in a bid to identify the boys who had been abused, where the crimes took place and when.' Evans, who is known to have visited nudist camps before being arrested, is not thought to have distributed images captured at the school to other paedophiles. Mr Hanson added: 'Philip Evans is a cold, calculating and manipulative paedophile who went to great lengths to secure indecent images of children. 'He abused his position as a teacher and as a cadet leader, and grossly betrayed the trust boys in his care placed in him. 'I am satisfied with the sentenced passed by the courts today and I believe it will go some way to help the children he abused.' King Edward’s, a fee-paying independent school, was founded in 1552 by Edward VI and boasts two Nobel Prize winners among its former pupils. In a statement issued after Evans pleaded guilty last month, the school said it was shocked and saddened by the charges and was co-operating fully with the police.","Philip Evans, 38, jailed for three years and eight months .

Liberal Democrat MP Lorely Burt has provoked anger among her constituents after she omitted the word 'Christmas' from her annual card in favour of the message 'Happy Holidays'. Residents accused the Liberal Democrat politician of being politically correct and unBritish, forcing Mrs Burt to issue an apology. Constituent Aminah Mehboob said: 'I am shocked that she has employed an obviously American phrase, rather than a more British greeting.' Lorely Burt's Christmas card which has been criticised for saying Happy Holidays and for being overly politically correct. Lorely Burt, the Solihull MP, has come under fire from constituents for her Christmas card which said 'Happy Holidays' One pensioner told The Birmingham Mail: “I feel offended. In my 66 years of living in this country, it is the first time I’ve seen our traditional Christmas card abandoned. I wonder which tradition we will be losing next.” Mrs Burt has apologised for her decision to wish local residents ‘Happy Holidays’ - a seasonal Christmas greeting preferred by Americans. She said: “I am sorry if my Christmas card offended anyone, and I look forward to continuing to fight for improved local services in the New Year. 'I have no hesitation in wishing all my constituents a very Merry Christmas.' Winterval was the name given to Christmas festivities in 1997 and 1998 by Birmingham council to reflect the diverse nature of the city's population. At the time the council said it was making the change to create a more welcoming, multi-cultural atmosphere due to the large proportion of ethnic groups. However, the move was widely criticised.  The Bishop of Birmingham, the Rt Rev Mark Santer, said it was political correctness gone mad, adding: 'I confess I laughed out loud when our city council came out with Winterval as a way of not talking about Christmas.' Resident Adam Higgs complained: ‘She may as well have wished her constituents a Merry Winterval since that is the name Birmingham City Council once used to seemingly marginalise use of the word Christmas.’ ‘I would wish those who celebrate them a Happy Diwali, Hanukkah, Eid, Chinese New Year, to name a few celebrations, not Happy Holidays. Of course, unlike Lorely, I have no problem in wishing all a Merry Christmas,’ he said. The row harks back to the Winterval . furore in Birmingham in the 1990s, a season of public events over . Christmas organised by the city council - a move widely considered . politically correct so as not to offend non-Christians . Julian Knight, the Conservative Solihull candidate said the card was a “nonsense” and that several people had contacted him to complain. He said: ‘No one can be offended by being wished a Merry or Happy Christmas. It is a Christian festival and those of other faiths, welcome it as such.’ 'This politically correct, treading on eggshells approach doesn't do anyone any favours. We should wish each other a Merry Christmas and be proud.' Lorely Burt in the 2010 general election.The Lib Dem MP has created a political correctness storm thanks to her card sent out to residents which said 'Happy Holidays'. It made no mention of Christmas . The greeting 'Happy Holidays' may seem out of place in Britain to some, but in the US the saying has been around for decades. Some say it dates back to the turn of the century, but more probably it came from the Irving Berlin song 'Happy Holidays' released for the 1942 film Holiday Inn. And it seems the greeting is gaining popularity in the US. A recent poll by the Public Religion Research Institute found that nearly half of Americans thought shops and companies should greet customers with a 'Happy Holidays' or 'Seasons Greetings' instead of 'Merry Christmas.' This compares to 2010 when 44 per cent of Americans preferred holiday neutral greetings. Politically, opinion is divided over the use of 'Happy Holidays' in the US. Over 60 per cent of Republicans favour using 'Merry Christmas' instead of 'Happy Holidays', while 58 percent of Democrats say the opposite, the poll showed. In addition, about two-thirds of young adults, aged 18-29, . support shops using a non-religious greeting.","Lib Dem MP Lorely Burt wishes constituents 'Happy Holidays'

A psychopath with a string of domestic violence convictions beat his lover to death in a row over Christmas presents two weeks after he was freed from jail. Russian Anastasia Voykina, 23, moved in with Felipe Lopes because she was 'idealistic' and wanted to help him overcome his mental health issues, the Old Bailey heard. But Lopes had a heated argument with her over a Christmas present and knocked their festive tree down the stairs, the court heard. Killer: Felipe Lopes (left) beat Anastasia Voykina (right) to death after a row over a Christmas present . Later, he woke her by pouring a bottle of cola over her face before sexually assaulting and bludgeoning her with a hockey stick at their maisonette flat in Streatham, south London. He left her body lying in the flat for more than a week with her leopard-print pyjama bottoms wrapped around her neck. She was only found after she was listed as a missing person a week later, and police put out an appeal to find Lopes. Lopes, 28, admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He said voices in his head told him to kill her and were saying: 'I'm her master'. Prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC said: 'The evidence suggests that Anastasia lost her life because she was idealistic. Happier times: Anastasia Voykina, pictured on the beach, loved Lopes and wanted to help him, the court heard . 'She believed she could help the defendant. 'She clearly loved the defendant and tried to change him. Sadly that cost her her life. 'Her friends said she was a lovely person but a bit naive. 'She wanted to explore the world and particularly loved London and everything London had to offer.' Lopes, . who had several convictions for assaulting ex-girlfriends, had ignored . warnings to keep taking his medication and stop smoking cannabis, the . court heard. He was released from Belmarsh Prison, London, on December 12 last year after serving his latest sentence. The last time Miss Voykina was seen alive was on December 29, the day she is believed to have been killed. Miss Voykina was killed in a flat in Streatham, south London (pictured: a general view of the street) Her . naked body lay on the floor of the blood-soaked maisonette they shared . for more than a week until it was found at 2am on January 7 this year. Miss Voykina had about 60 injuries to her face, head and neck. Her injuries also showed that she had . been sexually assaulted during the attack. Lacy material was found . wrapped around her neck along with a pair of leopard print pyjama . bottoms. 'Anastasia was attacked in the bedroom, possibly while she was asleep,' Miss Johnson said. 'Her body was dragged into the . bathroom and she was lifted into the bath and left there bleeding for . enough time to leave a pool of blood in the bath. 'She was dragged into the lounge and left.' In an interview after he was arrested, Lopes said a voice had told him to kill Miss Voykina, who was asleep in bed at the time. 'Anastasia . went to bed and the defendant was in the living room,' Miss Johnson . said. ‘He heard a male voice saying “I’m her master”. ‘The voice told him to kill Anastasia but not why. Jail: Lopes, 28, committed previous domestic abuse and served a jail term at Belmarsh Prison in east London . ‘He went into the bedroom where she was asleep and poured a bottle of coke over her heard which woke her up. ‘The defendant grabbed a hockey stick and attacked Anastasia. ‘He continued hearing the voice in his head and also Anastasia saying “I’m with my master”. ‘The voice then told him to leave the flat.’ Anastasia’s mother said her death had caused her ‘irreparable injury’. Lopes, a Portuguese national, pleaded guilty during a hearing last month and appeared at the Old Bailey today to be sentenced. He has been diagnosed with schizoid defective disorder, and the court must decide whether he will be jailed or detained under a hospital order. Psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph said Lopes had 'marked psychopathic traits.'

Traditionalist: Len Goodman has said he wants to see romance, not full-blown sex on the dancefloor . Len Goodman — feminist champion? It might sound unlikely, but bless him, Strictly’s head judge is coming over all strident on the subject of equality. We’ve been chatting about who could possibly replace Sir Bruce when he finally steps down as main presenter. Until now Len has always said there was only one man for the job: the ever-graceful Anton du Beke. Now, though, he’s throwing another name into the hat — Claudia Winkleman. He’s awfully impressed by how well she has done, fronting the Sunday night results show with Tess Daly. ‘The thing about Claudia is she is naturally witty, and very much at home in front of the cameras,’ he says. ‘I’m not saying Tess isn’t, but actually it’s refreshing, and they make a good double act. I don’t think it would be the worst thing in the world if they gave her the gig permanently, once Bruce decides he doesn’t want to do it any more. I think she’s marvellous.’ Would they though? Isn’t there an unwritten law about a primetime TV show having at least one male presenter? ‘Well, it usually is a man and a woman, isn’t it, but I don’t see why it has to be. It’s only because that’s the way it has always been done. I’m all for equality, me.’ Len, 69, is as straight-talking as they come. In recent weeks he has been accused of being curmudgeonly: the BBC’s resident Grumpy Old Man. ‘I don’t actually think I am grumpy,’ he harrumphs. ‘If the contestants on Strictly do something wrong, should I keep schtum? Not on your nelly! Sometimes I do think it comes out a bit harsh, a bit clumsy, but that’s the joy of live TV.’ Anyway, I tell him, we like grumpy on Saturday night telly. It beats saccharine. He laughs. ‘Yeah, when you’ve had a load of sugar, it’s nice to have a lemon. Anyway,  you can’t help how your mother put your hat on. You have to be yourself.’ Len is relishing the final. Who’s been the most surprising contestant this year? For him, it’s BBC Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid — whose early routine he described as ‘all bums and bongos’. Surprise: Len says BBC Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid has been the most surprising contestant this year . ‘She’s been the real revelation, hasn’t she?’ he laughs. ‘She sits there on the sofa of a morning, all prim and proper with  Bill Turnbull ... then she explodes on the dancefloor. I think that’s brilliant — what Strictly is all about, letting us see another side of these people.’ Isn’t he worried the show is getting too saucy, though? He had a pop at Casualty’s Patrick Robinson for a sexy routine. ‘It’s the ballroom, not the bedroom. What I want to see is romance — not fullblown sex on the dancefloor. A little spice is good. But we don’t want people sat at home going: “God, how disgusting.”' You might think Len, a former ballroom champ, gets irritated by less gifted dancers reaching the semi-finals. But he says the public vote keeps Strictly successful. ‘At the end of the day, it’s the great . entertainers we remember. Tell me this, who won Strictly the year Ann . Widdecombe was in? You can’t remember? Well, me neither. (It was Kara . Tointon). ‘I’ve done 11 series now (and 18 in the States). I struggle to remember even people who won the thing.’ Still, Len loves the show that turned him into a star. He was 60 and running a dance school in Kent when he was asked to join an updated Come Dancing. He jumped at the chance and has never looked back, and now has a radio show and his own Christmas special. Len Goodman’s Perfect Christmas, a mix of his favourite festive TV clips, will air on Boxing Day — ‘if anyone is still awake,’ he quips. ‘They are all there — Morecambe and Wise, the Two Ronnies — all the classics. I’m like anyone else. An old traditionalist,’ he says. Does he tune in to the EastEnders Christmas special, though? ‘I have never watched one episode of EastEnders, or Hollyoaks or Holby City. I don’t do soaps at all — deliberately. I think once you get in, you’re hooked. They are like heroin!’ Replacement? Len is impressed with how well Claudia Winkleman has done, fronting the Sunday night results show with Tess Daly . This is a problem when he fails to recognise soap stars when they pitch up on Strictly, ‘but better that than feel I have to tune in every day, and let them take over my life!’ Is there anything he hates on telly? He says he ‘doesn’t mind’ modern panel shows, but can’t be doing with swearing. ‘It’s the trendy thing, isn’t it, swearing for swearing’s sake — just because they think it is funny. It does get my goat.’ So is he a Christmas person, or a Grumpy Old Man? ‘No, I love Christmas, and I get really annoyed at these bah-humbug types who moan about it. Right moves? Model Abbey Clancy and Aljaz Skorjanec . ‘I love it! Sherry on Christmas morning, cracking open the Champagne, eating as much as you can. I’m quite traditional about it — this year I’ll be picking up my old mum and bringing her over to ours ... that’s what it’s all about.’ His mother Louisa is 96, and his biggest fan. He says, she is particularly happy as this will be the first Christmas Len has spent married to wife Sue, who is 21 years his junior. Although they have been together for years, they only tied the knot last December 30. ‘Everyone thought they were just coming for lunch — then we sprang it on them that we were getting married. But I had to tell my mum before hand, in case she collapsed from the shock. ‘She’s ever so pleased we finally did it. She was always going on to me before to make it nice and proper with Sue. ‘I suppose I wanted to do it before she passed away. I knew I was going to spend the rest of my life with Sue. She’s the only one in the world for me.’ So how is married life treating him? He sounds remarkably settled after a chequered romantic history. His first marriage, to dance partner Cherry Kingston, when in their 20s, was a bit of a disaster. ‘Oh it was lovely-jubbly at first because we were dancing together, but off the dancefloor, we had nothing in common. When we stopped performing, phhttt, that was it. She ran off with a Frenchman.’ Then came a relationship with Lesley, the mother of his son James. That too faltered. ‘I think the trouble was that I was quite a selfish person,’ he admits. ‘I think it’s quite common with men. Not that I understood that at the time. ‘I remember once meeting a medium and he gave me a reading, which I thought was going to be a load of tosh. But he got a lot of stuff right, then told me I must never get married because I was too selfish. Well, he was right. I was, and I am — although these days I’m about as tenth as selfish. ‘Part of me thinks that I just didn’t . meet Sue at the right time, but maybe if I had met her 20 years ago it . wouldn’t have worked, as I was a more selfish person. ‘I go out of my way to put her first now, that’s new for me. Saucy: Len had a pop at Casualty¿s Patrick Robinson for a sexy routine . ‘I’m quite domesticated,  which I can’t say I was before. With my first wife I tried to polish the dining table once, but mistook oven cleaner for Pledge and took the varnish off. It didn’t go down well. Now, I make an effort. Not really with the cooking — that’s Sue’s thing — but I am a lovely washer-upper, and like ironing. When Sue goes to work (she runs their dance school), I get the ironing board set up and I get on with it. ‘I have a system actually: tea towels first, then handkerchiefs, then shirts and so on.’ Married life clearly suits him — and he nags his son James, 27, to tie the knot, too. ‘I mean, he’s been with his girlfriend for years, but I would like them to get married, as I’m ready to be a grandad.’","Judge suggests Claudia Winkleman could take over from Bruce Forsyth .

The devastated family of a disabled grandfather killed by a hit-and-run driver have told of their heartache at having to face Christmas without him. Christopher Colegate, 69, who walked with the aid of two sticks, was knocked down on his way to his local Conservative club a week ago and left to die in the road. A £1,000 reward has been offered for information about the callous motorist who failed to stop and has not been caught. Knocked down: Christopher Colegate, 69, pictured holding his grandaughter in 2007 was killed in a hit and run collision as he walked to his local Conservative club . Mr Colegate’s daughter, Tash Motton, told a press conference at the club: 'We were really looking forward to Christmas. It should have been a happy end to what has already been a difficult year for the family. 'Now without dad, there will be an empty chair around the table on Christmas day and unopened presents under the tree. 'We now live with the knowledge that . every Christmas is going to be a reminder of this tragic incident. The . ache in our heart will never go away.' The . popular Poole pensioner’s two daughters made the impassioned plea as . they sat with their mother, Freda, at Oakdale Conservative Club in . Darby’s Lane, Poole, Dorset. Disabled: The popular Poole pensioner walked with the aid of two sticks . Despite suffering from a chronic disability which caused him to stoop, Mr Colegate played an active role in his community. Rachel Hayward, Mr Colegate’s other daughter, said: 'An innocent husband, dad and grandad - Chris Colegate - was taken from us in such a horrific way. 'The collision itself may well have been a genuine accident but we are all struggling to come to terms with the fact that the driver of that car did not stop following the collision. 'The driver could have come to his aid; could have called for help but instead, thought only of themselves and selfishly fled the scene.' She appealed for the driver to come forward and speak to Dorset Police. 'As hard as it is for our family, you also must be struggling to live with what you have done,' she said. 'What if it was your partner; your parents or your child? Could you really cope with that loss and the additional knowledge that the driver fled? 'If you were the driver, or you know who the driver is, please, please have the courage and decency to contact the police and come forward. 'It won’t bring dad back but it would give us a small crumb of comfort and help us to come to terms with what has happened.' Sergeant Stuart Pitman, from Dorset Police’s traffic unit, said officers had seen at first-hand the impact of the hit-and-run. 'He . had two grandchildren and we have had to explain to them why they won’t . be able to see him this Christmas when they were looking forward to . it,' he said. 'They were devastated.' Grief: Mr Colegate's family (L-R) wife Freda Colegate , daughter Tash Motton and daughter Rachel Hayward, appealed for the killer to give themselves up to the police . Sgt. Pitman said officers were studying CCTV footage, conducting house-to-house inquiries and following up all leads in the case. However, police have no description of the car involved. 'This driver would have known that they hit something in the road. I understand why they may be panicking at this time but to clear their conscience they need to hand themselves in. 'The net is closing in and we will find them.' Police are also appealing for motorists in the area when Mr Colegate was struck at 7.25pm on Friday, December 13 to contact them.

Police are now standing guard at the park. Video footage from Saturday's protest shows Cecily McMillan, leader of a Northeast Democratic Socialists group, apparently suffering a seizure after being handcuffed by police and left in the street. Former cheerleader Miss McMillan, who studies and works as a nanny in New York, was filmed shaking violently as protestors, who had been penned in by police, screamed for authorities to help. Police were seen carrying Miss . McMillan, 23, after the seizure. Activists yelled: 'That's not what you . do to someone with a seizure!' and 'Do not touch her head or neck!' 'Victim': Cecily McMillan, a student and nanny, reportedly suffered a seizure after she was allegedly violently arrested by police during an Occupy Wall Street protest in Zuccotti Park on Saturday night .

Prior to this Ms Reinhart, who knows . Miss McMillan from the camp, said she witnessed a police officer hitting . a young woman with a baton who appeared to be her. She told MailOnline: 'Cops were not in a hurry to help her and she was handcuffed. People in the crowd who have EMT licenses asked if they could go to her but police refused to let them through.'

An Occupy Wall Street sympathiser who tweeted about killing police has complained he has received death threats. Rusty Braxton, a 23-year-old restaurant manager from Florida, tweeted 'we wont make a difference if we dont kill a cop or 2' while watching footage of the protest at Zuccotti Park on Saturday. The NYPD said it has been in contact with officers in Florida, but it is not clear if they consider it a real threat. Braxton told the New York Daily News: 'I'm not really worried. You can't legally kick in someone's door for one comment on the Internet.' He added: 'I'm not a cop hater... [But] when I see the police throw people down and push people, I get upset.' The NYPD had sought a subpoena to find out who had written the tweet. Braxton has since been forced to remove his Twitter and Facebook accounts, he told the Daily News. An unidentified protester added: . '[Police] were just standing. They dragged her from the ground on the . street over to the curb and let her lay on the curb. 'They . did not support her neck or spine the way you're supposed to do when . someone is seizing to prevent them from choking on their tongue or their . own blood. They did none of those things.'

'I believe in a constrained view of . revolution,' she told Rolling Stone, adding that she wants to put . pressure on mainstream politicians. Attending the city's prestigious New School and . working as a nanny, Miss McMillan was unable to sleep in the park - but claimed to be devoted to the cause. She added that her grandfather Harlon Joye drafted the constitution for the Students for a Democratic Society, one of the key organisations of 1960s revolt. Following her arrest, there were reports that McMillan had been taken to an emergency room with possible cracked ribs. Injured: A woman, believed to be McMillan, is carried into an ambulance. She was one of scores arrested when police forced protestors out of Zuccotti Park on Saturday night . This afternoon, the OWS Twitter feed said she had been released without bail. The tensions came on the six-month anniversary of the OWS movement on March 17. Police swooped on Zuccotti Park after protesters . attempted to put up tents. Ms Reinhart, who is originally from Switzerland but lives in New York, also told MailOnline: 'Around 300 people were in Zuccotti Park at 11.30pm. It was peaceful, people were talking and dancing. 'About 200 police arrived and announced with a bull horn that the park was now closed for maintenance and that people would be arrested for trespassing. 'Many people sat down, locked arms and began chanting. Police grabbed them by the hair, beat them with sticks and chased those who tried to flee.' Following . the weekend's events, OWS activists called for supporters to skip work and school on . May 1 in protest and not spend any money. No end: Occupy Wall Street activists staged a protest to mark six months of the movement . Keeping guard: Around 73 people were arrested over the weekend in New York .

Susanna Reid’s racy routines on Strictly and her flirty interview techniques have raised more than a few eyebrows over the past few months. But a Tory politician found herself at the centre of a backlash yesterday after suggesting she’d like to give the Strictly finalist a ‘slap’. Deborah Dunleavy, 49, who was one of the ‘Cameron Cuties’ standing for  Parliament in 2010, provoked the row after watching the newsreader dance on Saturday’s show. Scroll down for video . Star: BBC Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid has impressed viewers on this year's series of Strictly Come Dancing but was criticised online by Conservative politician Deborah Dunleavy . Offence: Mrs Dunleavy deleted her Twitter account after attracting criticism for her message . She posted on Twitter: ‘Does anyone else just want to slap Susanna Reid …’ Her comments later drew furious accusations that she was advocating violence against women. Yesterday . Mrs Dunleavy apologised for her choice of words – but said it was . absurd that anyone could think a ‘flippant’ comment about a reality TV . show meant she supported violence. Mrs . Dunleavy failed to win a place in Parliament when she stood in Bolton . in the General Election. Next year she  will fight for a seat in the . European Parliament representing North West England. The . would-be MEP’s initial quip – in which she misspelt the BBC presenter . and Strictly Come Dancing favourite’s surname as ‘Ried’ – was originally . viewed by just her 733 followers. However . it was swiftly passed on by Sufrana Ismail, a Labour councillor in . Bolton, who wrote that it was ‘disappointing from someone who wants to . represent me in Europe’. Yesterday . the councillor added: ‘This wasn’t a personal conversation, but an . actual message from Mrs Dunleavy to 733 people and organisations who . were following her. ‘In an . age when violence against women is denounced by politicians from all . parties and closely associated with domestic violence, I found this . offensive and inappropriate.’ Another local Labour activist, Asha Ali, posted: ‘So you’re advocating violence against another women. Classy.’ Favourite: Reid and partner Kevin Clifton are tipped to win the Strictly final on Saturday night . And . Jane Black, a Labour councillor and university tutor, posted: ‘This is a . shameful comment for someone seeking public office, you should know . better.’ Yesterday Mrs . Dunleavy said she was ‘astounded’ by the response to her comment, . telling how the vicious reaction had left her feeling threatened. She . added: ‘I sincerely apologise to anyone who was offended by my comment – . it was supposed to be a flippant comment about reality TV. Surely no rational-minded person would think I was meaning to condone violence against women in any shape or form?’ Mrs . Dunleavy, who was involved in the Conservatives’ Women2Win campaign to . increase the number of female Tory MPs at the last election, insisted . that she hadn’t intended any disrespect towards Miss Reid. She . said: ‘We all find certain people on reality television irritating, but . she seems a very nice lady who like me is trying to hold down a job . while looking after a family as well – it was nothing personal. ‘What I’ve found particularly upsetting is the way I’ve been lambasted on Twitter by an aggressive posse of Labour activists. ‘Some . of my children are on Twitter and it’s very unpleasant for them to see . their mother bullied and told she’s not fit for public office in this . way. Unfortunately it’s this sort of abuse that puts women off trying to . take part in politics in the first place.’ Neither Miss Reid nor the BBC chose to comment on the tweet last night. However . one of Mrs Dunleavy’s close  relatives said the candidate had helped . her escape from an abusive relationship – and insisted that she would be . the last person to belittle the impact of domestic violence. The . woman, who can’t be named for legal reasons, said: ‘Deborah nursed me . when I had been physically hurt, she helped rehouse me and get me away . from a relationship in which I went to hell and back. ‘I . couldn’t have got through it without her help, so I can say for certain . that she would never downplay domestic violence – this was just a . tongue-in-cheek remark.’","Deborah Dunleavy is standing for Conservatives in European elections .

A family has unveiled their own postal service to rival the Royal Mail with next day delivery that is half the price of a first-class stamp. Newsagent owner Lorraine Lettley, 62, and daughter Trish, 37, set up the Welly Post this month after customers complained about the rising cost of sending letters. Just two weeks later, they have already delivered 4,000 letters and parcels, with an average rate of 250 packages a day. Cut-price: Lorraine Lettley, 62, set up the new service two weeks ago, allowing people to post for 30p . Alternative: It was in response to complaints about the rising price of post, with first-class stamps at 60p . Realising anyone is legally permitted to set up their own service, the Lettleys decided to run a cut-price delivery . Shoppers drop off post at the family shop, E J Teare Newsagents in Wellington, Somerset, where the Lettleys guarantee next day delivery within two-and-a-half miles for just 30p. And for 10p extra, the family collects letters from customers’ homes - crushing the 60p price tag for a first class stamp. Mrs Lettley's husband Richard, 66, delivers to half the town on his bike, cycling for up to two hours a day to ensure cards arrive on time. Meanwhile, Trish drives to outlying villages, and her mother covers the centre of town when she isn't manning the shop. Mrs Lettley covers the centre of town in Wellington, Somerset, while her daughter Trish drives further out . Hand-delivery: All of the post is hand-delivered within a 2.5-mile radius by Lorraine, her daughter and husband . Success: The Lettley family have already delivered 4,000 letters since launching the service this month . Mrs Lettley said: 'My daughter thought up the idea because we thought we do deliveries from the shop already - why not offer even more of a service to our customers. 'We had heard people mentioning about the cost of the Royal Mail and we felt it was something that we could possibly help out with. 'My husband recently retired and we were looking for something to keep him busy on his bike so this seemed perfect. The family started the service as a way to generate more income, but it has also united the community . Customers are clamouring to use the service in the run up to Christmas, as 12 cards is just £3.60 not £7.20 . 'We are thrilled by how it has taken off. People are really grateful for the extra help - and love that it costs less. With the price of post steadily rising, threats of rival agencies stealing the top spot as the nation's favourite postal service have been brewing for years. When the privatisation was finally announced this year, America's UPS poured £4.31 billion into European delivery firm TNT, to give it a boost over the flailing service. Legally, any business can incorporate mail delivery into their work. The Lettleys are believed to be the first family to set up their own delivery service since the privatisation, but they predict they will not be the only ones. 'People are so enthusiastic and it is bringing people out of their shells a bit too as it has become a bit of a talking point. 'The reaction has been nothing but positive and we are finding that people are really eager to be loyal to a local independent business.' Mrs Lettley, who worked in the shop for 18 years before taking it over seven years ago, said she plans to run the service all year round - and even offers business rates. The service is currently turning over more than £75 per day. The profits are enough to print promotional flyers - with money left over. She added: 'We did it partly to get footfall in the shop but also to offer a service for customers. 'Times are hard for everyone and it is going reasonably well financially for us too - we covered our start-up costs in a matter of days.' Mother-of-four Julie Watkin, 55, used the service to deliver 12 Christmas cards last week. She said: 'It is really great. You know that it is going to get there - and you know who is going to deliver it - and you can’t beat the price. 'It feels good to support the local community and be part of something too.' Mother-of-four Julie Watkin applauded the service as reliable and a boost to community spirit . Having already made £75 in just 14 days, the family has enough profits to print stamps and promotional flyers . Despite raking in profits and customers, Mrs Lettley insists Post Office workers are accepting of their new venture, and don't mind the extra help. She said: 'They’ve still been coming in and buying their cigarettes and things so I think we are ok. 'I don’t think we are going to be running the Royal Mail out of business anytime soon.'","Lorraine, Trish and Richard Lettley have delivered 4,000 letters in two weeks .

Mystery death: Joseph Tutaj, 15, died on a school trip to Disneyland. He suffered a high fever and illness before collapsing - dying in hospital a day later . Popular: Joseph Tutaj has been remembered by friends at Seaford High School. He was said to be a kind teenager who loved his role playing the trumpet with the school band . He continued to brave the illness until he collapsed in front of terrified school friends on a day trip to Santa Monica pier. He was rushed to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center but died 24 hours later on Tuesday, February 19. His mother was in New York's JFK airport waiting to fly out to be with him when she was told he had died. 'This was supposed to be such a great trip for him,' she told Long Island Newsday. 'He couldn't wait to go.' It is the third tragedy to befall the Tutaj family from Seaford, Long Island. Joseph's father Robert is suffering with advance stage cancer and the family's home was destroyed in Hurricane Sandy.

He said the 6-foot-2 sophomore was a 'gentle giant' and 'the light of his life'. As well as his love for the marching band, Joseph has been remembered for his kindness and love of video games and scouting. Touching tributes have been left by dozens of school friends on Facebook tribute sites and they also gathered for a prayer service on Thursday. They are also raising money to support the family and plan to hold an event in Joseph's memory. The teen's best friend Dominick Porcelli wrote to his family in one of his posts.

Fellow band-member Tracy De Leon wrote on Thursday: 'Joe, today in band we all played for you, everyone cried for you, we all are gong to miss you.' His death has rocked the small community of Seaford and the cause of his death has baffled his family and friends. He said he felt ill and was suffering a high fever but had no previous health problems or known allergies.

An Irish woman at the centre of a right-to-die campaign has passed away, her partner has said. Marie Fleming, 59, had multiple sclerosis, a disease that attacks the central nervous system, and had been paralysed for several years. Her partner Tom Curran, 65, has long campaigned to be able to help her commit suicide, and lost a highly publicised court battle earlier this year. Euthanasia campaigner: Marie Fleming, 59, had multiple sclerosis, a disease that attacks the central nervous system, and had been paralysed for several years . Mr Curran said Ms Fleming, a mother-of-three, died early Friday morning at home in Arklow, County Wicklow and that he had not been expecting her death. ‘She was at home. That was her wish,’ said her partner of almost 20 years. In April this year, Ireland's Supreme Court ruled that nothing in the country's 1937 constitution could authorize the deliberate taking of a life on humanitarian grounds. It said lawmakers could pass such a law to permit Ms Fleming to die at a time of her choosing, but no such statute existed yet. Fleming, a former University College Dublin lecturer, testified during the trial that her life had been reduced to untreatable agony and she feared choking to death because she couldn't swallow. Mr Curran, an advocate for The Carers . Association and a founding member of Right to Die Ireland, faced 14 . years in prison if he had helped his partner to die. Former lecturer Marie and her partner Tom Curran, 65, from Arklow, County Wicklow, lost a highly publicised court case earlier this year over her right to die . Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore said his thoughts were with Mr Curran and with her children Corrinna and Simon. ‘Marie's campaign on issues around the right to die was both brave and courageous,’ said the Labour Party leader. ‘And while pursuing her campaign - at both political and legal levels - was always going to be a challenge, her deeply-held conviction meant it was one she was never going to back away from. ‘Marie successfully highlighted the complex issues that affect people who find themselves in a situation like hers, and the fact that her case has kick-started a national debate on these matters will be her lasting legacy.’ Independent TD John Halligan, who led the couple's battle in the Irish Parliament, said Ms Fleming died at 5.30am. ‘They are both very brave and loving people who cared for and loved each other deeply,’ he said. ‘She was a very intelligent and articulate person. Her health had been getting progressively worse in the last few weeks. Tom had hopes she would make it through Christmas, but it wasn't to be. ‘He knew this was inevitable, but it was still a shock. He is devastated.’ He added that Mr Curran plans to continue his fight to change the law on assisted suicide in the new year. ‘We are hoping to have a meeting with barristers, TDs and senators and take it from there,’ he added. Sinn Fein's Caoimhghin O Caolain said Ms Fleming's ordeal touched the hearts of people across Ireland and beyond. ‘Her courage and that of her partner won widespread admiration,’ he said. ‘We owe it to her memory to approach with compassion and realism the debate on the issue of assisted suicide, conscious always of those who suffer such painful ordeals as that endured by Marie.’ Billy Kelleher, Fianna Fail health spokesman, said he was saddened to learn of Ms Fleming's death. ‘I want to extend my deepest sympathies to Marie Fleming's partner Tom Curran, her family and friends,’ he said. ‘Marie Fleming battled her illness with fortitude and great dignity. Her campaign brought important issues into the public domain and she, along with her partner Tom, displayed huge courage throughout.’","Marie Fleming, 59, has died in her home in County Wicklow, ireland .

In what would be the largest ever takeover of a U.S. company by a Chinese firm at $4.7 billion, Smithfield Foods has agreed to be purchased by China's largest meat producer. Now residents of the small town of Smithfield in southeastern Virginia that was built by and still revolves around the ham company wonder what the purchase means to their community. You can't go far in this historic southeastern Virginia town without seeing a pig and reception to the news is as mixed as whether the locals favor salt-cured or sugar-cured ham. Major hams: Smithfield Foods Inc. in Smithfield, Virginia, the world's largest pork producer has agreed to be bought out by Chinese meat giant Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd . A herd of life-size swine statues lines . its downtown, an ornament of a piglet wearing a bandanna adorns a front . lawn, hams hang in storefronts and a pickup truck flaunts the license . plate 'PIG TIME.' Smithfield Foods Inc. agreed to the multi-billion dollar offer from Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd., the majority shareholder in China's largest meat processor. The deal still faces a federal regulatory review and Smithfield shareholder approval. Steps from the site where the company was founded in 1936, residents in the 'Ham Capital of the World' greet each other on a main street lined with white picket fences and Victorian-style homes, and welcome a neighbor back from a recent trip out of town. Just down the road, workers shuffle into the company's packing plants for their shifts. Looking out on the street that's lined with antique cars every weekend, locals frequent Smithfield Gourmet Bakery and Beanery, grabbing their morning coffee and pastry. Some are shocked that 'China would own our Smithfield,' said Carolyn Burke, a longtime resident who owns the eatery. 'It's Smithfield ham, it's not China ham,' Burke said. Big business: The $4.7 billion deal would lend even more sway to the Shuanghai group, China's biggest meat producer, and would be the largest takeover of a US company by a Chinese firm ever . And she's right: Pork produced here for more than 300 years became so popular that many places in the 1930s tried to pass off their ham as Smithfield ham, which led to branding each ham so customers knew it was authentic. The state even passed a since-revised law in 1926, stating the 'Smithfield ham' moniker could only be used for cuts of peanut-fed hogs processed and salt-cured in the town limits. The town also is home to the world's oldest cured ham from 1902 at the Isle of Wight museum - complete with its own brass collar around the hock. As important as the pork itself is Smithfield Foods, which employs about 3,800 people in Virginia. In its most recent fiscal year, it brought in sales of more than $13 billion and made a profit of $361 million. The company, its founding family - the Luters - and those who work there donate time and money to the community, funding parks, public restrooms and other projects. 'You either have a family member who works there, or has worked there, or you had a summer job there. It's just such a part of our community,' said Sheila Gwaltney, the director of a local arts center and a more-than-40-year resident whose husband's family has been in the area since 1666. 'Smithfield has been so good for the town.' Hostile takeover? Smithfield has long been the heart of smalltown Smithfield, Virginia and locals now wonder what might change . With its namesake and well-being on the line, Smithfield native and Mayor T. Carter Williams, 71, hopes the pending sale doesn't compromise the town's identity. 'They say that everything's going to stay the same, and we all just hope that it does,' he said. His wife, Connie, works at Taste of Smithfield, a hometown restaurant the company opened about a year ago to showcase its products. 'We'll just see where it ends up, time will tell.' In an interview with The Associated Press, Smithfield Foods CEO Larry Pope said the move showed 'the globalization of the world and how it affects small-town America.' 'But Smithfield, Virginia, has nothing to worry about,' Pope said. 'We're in a mature market ... and to continue to grow we have to look at opportunities outside the United States.' Bob Barnes, who worked as an accountant at Smithfield Foods for about 10 years before retiring, sees only 'good things happening' for the company that has had its share of ups and downs over the years. Changing times: Workers approach the gates of Smithfield foods. CEO Larry Pope said the move showed 'the globalization of the world and how it affects small-town America' Pork producers such as Smithfield have been caught in a tug of war with consumers. The company needs to raise prices to offset rising commodity costs, namely the corn it uses for feed. But consumers are still extremely sensitive to price changes in the current economy. By raising prices, Smithfield risks cutting into its sales should consumers cut back or buy cheaper meats, such as chicken. In 2009, Smithfield Foods posted its first annual loss since 1975, and again in 2010, but has since rebounded. And one of its largest shareholders had been pushing Smithfield to consider splitting itself up in recent months. 'Somebody's gotta own it,' Barnes said. 'It's just money. It doesn't bother me as long as it doesn't change our philosophy, our life, our politics (and) it doesn't shut down places.' Gwaltney agreed: 'When you think about it, that should be very good economically for the company ... and what's good for the company is good for us.' There is at least one drawback that residents note: They'll soon be unable to own Smithfield stock - a tangible piece of the company named after the town that pork built.","Smithfield Foods, the world's largest .

He replied: 'Burkitt, Mills with a cartouch box [containing charge or shot for a gun] round him, but whether under arms I cannot say, Christian [Fletcher] upon deck with a bayonet, and Sumner and Quintal below.' The testimony of Peckover, who remained loyal to the ship's captain, William Bligh, would help to shed light on the events on one of the most notorious incidents in British naval history.

Part of the testimony given by William Peckover, a gunner who was loyal to Bligh, heard in court at Portsmouth in September 1792 . A gang of disgruntled sailors commandeered the 90ft Bounty in 1789, rebelling against their captain following a research voyage to Tahiti to collect plants. Led by ship's mate Christian Fletcher, . the mutineers cast Bligh and 19 of his loyal sailors adrift in a rowing . boat before escaping to Pitcairn Island where they planned to settle. They set fire to the Bounty to cover their tracks. But their crimes caught up with them . two years later when, after news of the mutiny reached Britain, a ship . was dispatched to arrest the mutineers. After rounding up 14 out of 23 of them, they were imprisoned in a makeshift cell on the deck of HMS Pandora. Four . died along with 31 crewmen when the ship ran aground on the Great . Barrier Reef, but the remaining ten prisoners were returned to Britain . to face court martial in Portsmouth. The fascinating 80-page document, . written by lawyer Stephen Barney, features an appendix containing a . 'Full Account of the Real Causes and Circumstances of that Unhappy . Transaction, the Most Material of Which Have Hitherto Been Withheld from . the Public' - which includes Bligh's written testimony. In his written testimony, William Bligh (left) said: 'A little before sunrise, Fletcher . Christian, who was mate of the ship and officer of the watch, came into . my cabin while I was asleep, and seizing me, tied my hands with a cord, . assisted by the others who were also in the cabin, all armed with . muskets and bayonets.' Christian is pictured centre; and right, a replica of the Bounty . An illustration of the mutiny on the Bounty of 1789 . Witnesses for the prosecution . mentioned in the minutes include John Fryer, William Cole, William . Purcell, Thomas Hayward, John Smith, John Hallet and the aforementioned . William Peckover, who appeared before the court in person. Following the trial, three of the mutineers were hanged, four were acquitted and three were pardoned. The front cover of the document names the defendants and the charge they face. It states: 'On a charge of mutiny on . the 28th April 1789, on board his Majesty's ship Bounty, for running . away with the ship, and deserting his Majesty's service; . 'Against . Joseph Coleman, Charles Norman, Thomas McIntosh, Peter Heywood, James . Morrison, John Milward, William Musprat, Thomas Burkitt, Thomas Ellison . and Michael Byrne.' The . first witness account is the letter written by Bligh. He revealed the chilling . moment Fletcher Christian seized him and tied him to the mast. The 1962 film, Mutiny On The Bounty, starring Marlon Brando (left, as Fletcher Christian) and Trevor Howard (centre, as Captain Bligh) Pitcairn was discovered in in 1767 by the British and settled by the mutineers in 1790. Fletcher . Christian and the mutineers put The Bounty's captain William Bligh and . many crewmen on a launch which eventually reached Timor. The mutineers . first sailed to Tahiti, dropping off 16 of their number. There, Robert Thompson shot Charles Churchill dead and was himself stoned to death by Churchill's Tahitian family. Christian Fletcher, eight mutineers and 18 Tahitians then set sail to avoid apprehension, landing on Pitcairn in 1790. The Tahiti-based mutineers were recaptured in 1791. Three were later executed after a trial. In . 1793, the mutineers and the male Tahitians fought a war, that killed . all the male Tahitians and four of the mutineers, including Christian. By the time a U.S. ship visited in 1808 only one mutineer, John Adams, was still alive, with nine women and some children. The population has dropped from 250 in the 1930s to 50. It is 3,300 miles away from New Zealand and has no harbour or airstrip. Visitors must fly to an outlying Tahitian island and then travel by boat for 36 hours to get there. Many of the men operate the island's only boats, which are lifelines to the outside world, ferrying in essential supplies. It reads: 'A little before sunrise, Fletcher Christian, who was mate of the ship and officer of the watch, came into my cabin while I was asleep, and seizing me, tied my hands with a cord, assisted by the others who were also in the cabin, all armed with muskets and bayonets. 'I was now threatened with instant death if I spoke a word... I was forced on deck in my shirt with my hands tied, and secured by a guard abaft the mizzen mast. 'I now demanded of Christian the cause of such a violent act, but no other answer was given but ""Hold your tongue, Sir, or you are dead this instant"". 'Holding me by the cord which tied my hands he often threatened to stab me in the breast with a bayonet he held in his right hand.' Captain Bligh then recalled how he was forced to get into the small rowing boat with some of his men. The letter continues: 'The boatswain was ordered to hoist the launch out, and while I was kept under a guard with Christian at their head abaft the mizzen mast, the officers and men not concerned in the mutiny were ordered into the boat. 'This being done, I was told by Christian, ""Sir, your officers and men are now in the boat, and you must go with them"". 'I was at last forced into the boat and we were then veered astern, in all nineteen souls.' Once adrift, Bligh made for nearby Tonga but his problems were far from over. Two days after he and his party stepped ashore on the tiny island of Tufoa, they were attacked by natives. Bligh's testimony states: 'When the natives discovered we had no fire arms, they attacked with clubs and stones, in the course of which I had the misfortune to lose one very worthy man, John Norton. 'But getting into our boat was no security, for they followed us in canoes loaded with stones, which they threw with much force and exactness. 'Happily, night saved the rest of us.' William Peckover, who was loyal to Bligh, gave evidence in person at the trial. The minutes read: 'I was awaked out of my sleep by a confused noise; directly after, I thought I heard the fixing of bayonets. 'I jumped out, and put my trousers on. At the door I met Mr Nelson the Botanist, who told me that the ship was taken from us. 'Mr Nelson answered, ""It is by our own people and Mr Christian at their head"". 'When I came upon deck I saw Captain Bligh, and Mr Christian standing alongside of him with a naked bayonet. 'Then I went down into the boat; the sentry saw me down. Then I believe there was about ten or twelve in the boat. 'In about four or five minutes after this, the remainder with Mr Bligh came into the boat. 'Mr Cole at different times asked Captain Bligh to cast the boat off, or cast her loose, that he was rather dubious of their firing into us. 'I cannot say the answer that Captain Bligh made him, but the boat was cast adrift, but by whom I can't tell.' Luke Batterham, book specialist at . auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'This document is of great historical . significance and it is very rare it should come on the market. After having been cast adrift, Bligh and his crew were hospitably received by the Governor of Timor . 'It . is a scarce item that could be seen as the founding stone of the . episode involving Captain Bligh and the mutiny on the Bounty. 'It is an incident which still captures the imagination and in which there is an enormous interest. 'This is the official account as it was first told at the time.' Bligh survived the mutiny after navigating his tiny rowing boat 3,600 miles to Timor, an island in south-east Asia, before returning to Britain. He later faced a court martial himself for the loss of his ship but was acquitted and eventually rose to the rank of Admiral. Christian Fletcher and the surviving mutineers stayed on the Pitcairn Islands where their descendants live to this day.

The IRS spent taxpayer money to make a silly video with several employees learning the 'Cupid Shuffle' for a 2010 employee conference in Anaheim, California . The video, which features several IRS employees being taught the group dance and making what is meant to be humorous banter such as, 'This is harder than doing an op review,' came to light just a few days before a new report on the spending habits of the government agency. The report entitled 'Collected and Wasted: The IRS Spending Culture and . Conference Abuses,' was compiled by the Treasury Inspector . General for Tax Administration, a government watchdog group. The group previously uncovered condemning information that the IRS was targeting specific conservative political groups applying for tax-exempt . status. The dance video is from the IRS's 2010 employee conference, which will be one of the main focuses of the forthcoming report. According to The Washington Post, the forthcoming report contains information that the IRS spent approximately $49 million on employee conferences . over the past three years. The IRS has made several expensive training videos (such as a Star Trek-themed video pictured here) using tax payer dollars, totaling up to approximately $60,000 spent, according to a report . The Anaheim conference held for 2,600 employees in IRS's small business and self-employed division reportedly cost $4.1 million dollars to put together and was paid for in part with unused funds from the IRS's enforcement budget, according to the newspaper . 'Whether it is the tens of thousands . of hard-earned taxpayer dollars . spent to produce frivolous entertainment for agency bureaucrats, or the . IRS’s own admission that it targeted the American people based on their . personal beliefs, the outrage toward the IRS is only growing stronger,” Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Charles Boustany told . Politico in a . statement. Boustany continued to say that the video further proves that the . government agency is a place 'where abuse and waste is the norm and not . the exception.' Earlier this year the IRS was caught making two expensive training videos for employees that parodied television shows Star Trek and Gilligan's Island. After The Ways and Means committee discovered the videos and learned that thousands of dollars in taxpayer money were spent on making them, they demanded the IRS turn over all videos 'depicting television or movie parodies.' IRS frivolous spending on expensive training videos (a Gilligan Island-based video pictured here) and employee conferences has caught the attention of the House Ways and Means committee, which is reviewing the agency closely . The 'Cupid Shuffle' video was handed to committee as part of the request. The IRS stated making the expensive training videos after the Obama administration cut the agency's administrative expenses for travel and conferences, The Washington Post reported. With limited funds to meet their employees face to face, the IRS instead poured their money into the theatrical videos. In response to the new video, acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel called the money spent on conferences in the past 'inappropriate' and promised to institute measures to prevent this from happening again, Politico reported. 'Sweeping new . spending restrictions have been put in place at the IRS, and travel and . training expenses have dropped more than 80 percent since 2010 and . similar large-scale meetings did not take place in 2011, 2012 or 2013,' Werfel said. The IRS is expected to come under much scrutiny for their spending in the next few days, especially because the agency has repeatedly asked lawmakers for increased funding for their enforcement division, from which they used excess funds on conferences. At the close of the 'Cupid Shuffle' video the IRS employees are filmed commenting on the dance lesson. A female employee who turns to the camera and says, 'And I thought doing the Star Trek video was humiliating.'

A church trustee and former magistrate is being investigated on suspicion of conning his fellow parishioners out of £6 million. Patrick Coppeard, 48, a former broker at financial giant Merrill Lynch, voluntarily attended a police station. The father of three was accompanied by the Rector of St John’s Church in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, where reality television star Jade Goody’s funeral was held in 2009. As detectives questioned Mr Coppeard, the rector, the Rev Dr Ian Farley, began contacting about 40 parishioners from a list of 82 who are suspected of being duped out of large sums over four years. ‘There was an initial feeling of shock when I got the call,’ said one parishioner last night. ‘Now that emotion has turned to anger. It’s not about the money, it’s about being betrayed.’ The Serious Economic Crime Unit of Essex Police is examining claims some people lost up to £250,000 after allegedly being promised rapid returns on investments, including backing the expansion of a coffee chain in the US. A text sent to a St John’s parishioner at 10.37pm on May 8, hours before police launched their probe, reads: ‘Just put the phone down to New York. There’s a great trade. One hundred per cent money back Tuesday but need rapid answer by 9am latest. Maximum £5k per head.’ The investor who received the text lost £37,000. Other alleged victims include local pensioners who lost nest eggs and teenagers who handed over savings built up to cover university costs. Wealthy backers at St John’s have organised a five-figure hardship fund to help those unable to meet immediate needs because of their losses. One man, who had almost £100,000 invested at one stage, said police had told him only about 40 suspected victims had so far come forward from the list, with estimated losses totalling about £3 million. Abuse of trust: Coppeard allegedly targeted parishioners at the church of St. John the Baptist, Buckhurst Hill . Former employers: Coppeard, 48, used to a broker at financial giant Merrill Lynch . ‘If everyone involved gets in touch with police, you’re looking at up to £6 million, maybe more,’ he said. Senior church figures are also suspected of having been defrauded. St John’s Treasurer Rob Smith said: ‘Reparation won’t be possible, I’ve been told.’ One parishioner said: ‘People were talking about the best way to deal with this, and about forgiveness, but it might take some of us a little longer to get round to that.’ Mr Coppeard, who resigned in February after more than ten years as a magistrate in East London, declined to comment yesterday at his £1 million home in Loughton. ‘If you have any questions, you should direct them to the police,’ he said as the family prepared for his daughter Charlotte’s church wedding, which was held away from St John’s. He has been released on police bail until October.","Patrick Coppeard's victims include pensioners who have lost their nest eggs .

Germany is about to start a high-tech - and high altitude - hunt for graffiti vandals using pilotless drones of the sort used by western forces to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. Instead of a warhead the Deutsche Bahn drones will be equipped with cameras to catch out the vandals costing the national railway company over six million pound costs in the annual clean up of graffiti. Most graffiti is sprayed at night so the plan calls for the drones to carry infra red cameras which will pick out the vandals at work. Vandals: Graffiti artists have been targeted Deutsche Bahn train terminals at night . Testing is due to take place at particularly badly hit depots and marshalling yards where trains are parked in a pristine condition at nightfall only to be covered in unwanted 'art' come sunrise. Strict anti-surveillance and privacy in laws may yet challenge Deutsche Bahn's programme. Internet giant Google was forced to give people an opt out from their Street View service when a huge outcry followed its inception. But Deutsche Ban insists that only people found on its property would be targeted by the cameras. The idea behind the drones comes from years of frustrating cat-and-mouse games with vandals across railyards and depots. 'We have to find news ways to wage the anti-graffiti struggle,' said the head of railways security Gerd Neubeck. A black box recorder on the drones would accurately pinpoint where the graffiti is taking place to be able to allow for successful prosecutions once vandals are identified. The high-tech 'Tracker' drones will be painted in the red and black of German Railways. They can fly nearly 500 feet high at nearly 30 mph for 80 minutes at a stretch. Drones: The unmanned aircraft are more usually used in warfare . They cost £50,000 and will be controlled from a central command post. Deutsche Bahn's planned deployment comes just weeks after the German government halted an expensive project to build its own military drone called Euro Hawk because of mounting costs. Deutsche Bahn belives that its Tracker squadron may also prove useful in identifying where bridges and long track stretches that need extra maintenance. Drones are used by Western forces in Afghanistan to target Taliban forces. The US is also carrying out a highly controversial a drone programme to target suspected terrorists in Pakistan. Many Pakistanis see it as an infringement on their sovereignty and complain that innocent civilians have also been killed, something the US rejects.Islamabad officially opposes the use of US drones on its territory, but is believed to have tacitly approved some strikes in past.","Train company Deutsche Bahn wants to catch vandals in the act .

Tell All: Katherine Losse was a grad school refugee when she joined Facebook as employee #51 in 2005 . Facebook has developed an experimental feature called ‘Dark Profiles’ which would give secret accounts to people who did not even sign up, a new book claims. Engineers wanted to create shadow pages for those who were tagged in photos by their friends in the hope they would cave in and join the social networking website,  Katherine Losse, the author of The Boy Kings: A Journey into the Heart of the Social Network, says. Nobody at Facebook ‘even flinched’ when staff raised this disturbing new twist as they were so blinded by their mission to take over the world. The book also claims that in 2007 Facebook technicians worked on programme called ‘Judgebox’ which would let users compare and rate women in echoes of founder Mark Zuckerberg’s sexist ‘Facemash’ app he developed at Harvard. It confirms for the first time that Facebook staff have a programme called ‘Facebook Stalker’ which lets them track who has been visiting their profiles . And in the early days of the social networking website, employees were given the ‘master’ password with no security checks at all - and allowed to do as they pleased. The claims are in a new book by Katherine Losse who worked for Facebook between 2005 and 2010 and worked her way up from customer relations to be the speechwriter for its founder Mark Zuckerberg. She claims that in Autumn 2006 everyone at the company was ‘so convinced that Facebook was something that everyone should have that when the product team created an experimental feature called dark profiles in 2006, nobody even flinched’. People can be tagged in Facebook photos even if they do not have a profile, and the idea was to create a ‘dark’ version which could apparently be activated if they finally signed up. Rising Star: Losse worked for Facebook between 2005 and 2010 and worked her way up from customer relations to be the speechwriter for its founder Mark Zuckerberg . Losse writes: 'It reminds me now of the way members of the Mormon church convert dead people, following the logic that if they had know about Mormonism when they were alive they would have been believers’. One of Zuckerberg’s colleagues later told her: ‘You see, Mark always had this idea for a kind of Wikipedia for people, or what he called a ""dark Facebook"", where each person would have a wall and people could write anything about them on it. ‘That was actually what he was going to make first at Harvard. But he realised that people wouldn’t use something that didn’t allow them to erase the bad things people said about them, so he made Facebook instead’. Thus the product they built was a kind of compromise.’ Losse, who has an English masters from Johns Hopkins University, claims that as recently as 2007 Facebook engineers were working on ‘Judgebox’ despite being obviously sexist. The plan was to put two women’s Facebook profile pictures side by side with space for a viewer to put a score for each. The tagline was ‘Judgebox.com: never judge a (face) book by her cover’ and engineers registered the websites Judgebox.com and Prettyorwitty.com, though they never made it into the full version. Insider: One of Zuckerberg's colleagues later told her: 'You see, Mark always had this idea for a kind of Wikipedia for people, or what he called a ""dark Facebook"", where each person would have a wall and people could write anything about them on it' Zuckerberg had already developed such a programme at Harvard and called it Facemash  - but this could potentially be for all of Facebook’s 25 million users at the time. Losse, who is originally from Phoenix, Arizona, writes: ‘It was moments like these that I realised it was the great and twisted genius of Facebook for anyone who was interested in rating things constantly, as Mark and the engineers who made these types of applications seemed to love doing. 'Mark always had this idea for a . kind of Wikipedia for people, or what he called a ""dark Facebook"", . where each person would have a wall and people could write anything . about them on it.' Katherine Losse, The Boy Kings . ‘Facebook made it possible for men to have endless photographs of women available for judging, and women simply by being on Facebook became fodder for the judging like so many swimsuit models in a Miss America pageant.’ Rumours have long circulated of a feature which allows you to see who exactly has visited your profile, and in her book Losse confirms that it does - but only for Facebook staff. She said that to her surprise . ‘Facebook Stalker’ as they called it showed that her female friends . spend longer on her profile than her male friends. Losse . also reveals her shock at being given the password to the ‘master’ Facebook account called ‘The Creator’ which they could use to check . through any person’s profile they wanted. Lest Ye Be Judged: Losse, who has an English masters from Johns Hopkins University, claims that as recently as 2007 Facebook engineers were working on 'Judgebox' despite being obviously sexist . In her customer service role, she would use this to resolve problems users were having and deal with genuine complaints. But she writes: ‘I experienced a brief moment of stunned disbelief: they just handed over the password with no background check to make sure I am not a crazed stalker’ The claims come at a difficult time for Facebook - it recently sparked yet another backlash after being caught out trying to force its 900 million users to adopt its own email service. It was accused of ‘hijacking’ users’ contact details and deleting their personal email addresses without asking them first. In its place is an @facebook.com one instead - even if they never use it. Facebook also still reeling from its bungled IPO which wiped a third off of its value and sparked a $3billion lawsuit from investors. The claims in the book will raise fresh questions about a ruling by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission last year that Facebook was not collecting profiles for non-users. The Internet regulator had claimed in a complaint that Facebook was harvesting data from people without an account such as names, phone numbers and email addresses. But in a ruling commissioner Billy Hawkes said that they could find no evidence that use was made of such information. Its decision does not exclude the possibility that back in 2006 - or even sooner - ‘Dark Profiles’ were being actively pursued by Facebook because the commission’s investigation took place last year. Facebook declined to comment.","Former employee shares secrets of social networking giant's first years .

Rumours began circulating last month Apple could be working on a curved phone and the firm's latest patent has added serious weight to these claims. The patent describes the manufacture of a concave screen which can be made at high temperatures - current methods involve heating screens for longer at lower temperatures.

The patent describes the manufacture of a convex touchscreen, illustration pictured, made at high temperatures - current methods involve heating screens for longer at lower temperatures. It is thought the technology could be used for the rumoured upcoming range of curved 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhones . Any Apple curved devices would directly compete with LG's G Flex handset and the Samsung Galaxy Round. The G Flex is curved vertically so it moulds more comfortably to a user's face and gives improved voice and sound quality. It also has a so-called 'self-healing' case made from an elastic coating capable of 'recovering from daily wear-and-tear scratches and nicks.' Samsung’s Round phone curves along the top and bottom edges. The Galaxy Round and G Flex are both available in Korea and the G Flex will additionally be available in the U.S next year. According to the patent, discovered by Apple Insider, Apple's method of creating a curved screen would involve placing the different components onto a flat surface. Once the electrodes are in place, the whole structure could be heated and curved as a single entity. Popular current methods involve putting a screen onto a curved surface and heating just the screen and film. This means it has to be heated at lower temperatures for longer, to avoid the screen becoming damaged. Under Apple's plans, higher temperatures could be used which would speed up the process. Last month, sources told Bloomberg that Apple is working on two larger-screen curved handsets, expected to . launch by the end of next year. The . person ‘familiar with the plans’ said Apple is developing a 4.7-inch as . well as a 5.5-inch model to rival Samsung and LG’s latest bendy . handsets.

Reports added Apple’s curved glass could also come with sensors capable of identifying how heavy, or light, a user’s touch is, meaning it could distinguish different pressure points. The benefits of this feature have not been explained. Both of Apple's new handsets are said to be ‘still in development’ meaning they may not be released until at least September 2014.This would coincide with Apple’s annual product launch.

The Round is curved along the top to make it more comfortable to hold in the hand . Samsung released its curved Galaxy Round last month, followed shortly by LG’s G Flex phone. Apple has traditionally stuck with smaller screens, and its latest iPhone 5C and 5S devices are only 4-inches big.

Affecting more than eight out of 10 women, cellulite is considered one of the curses of our gender ... but the next weapon in the quest to banish orange-peel thighs has arrived. A pioneering invasive cosmetic treatment which targets the dreaded appearance of quilted, pitted fat has hit the market causing a media storm. Cellulite occurs when the strands that connect the . layers of tissue and the fat below the skin (fibrous septae) gradually harden and . contract, while the fat between stays the same and protrudes out in a lumpy fashion. Diet, exercise, creams and massage could help, but rarely manages to permanently shift cellulite . Diet, exercise, creams and massage do help, but chronic sufferers are constantly on the look out for a long-term solution. The Sunday Times Style magazine has repotred that new laser cellulite treatment Cellulaze claims to melt the fat and then break down the fibres anchoring the tiny fat pockets, thus banishing the appearance of cellulite. It is the first scientifically validated laser cellulite treatment to win the approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which accepted the results of Cellulaze's year-long trial last January. The study was conducted in the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and monitored a group of women with an average age of 47. It showed that just one Cellulaze . treatment prevented the return of cellulite for at least a year. There . are even claims that the earliest patients have remained cellulite-free . for three years. The treatment, which costs upwards of £2,500, takes one to two hours and involves a local anaesthetic and mild sedation, followed by the insertion of a laser rod, like a fine knitting needle, just below the surface of the skin through a series of tiny cuts, reported the Sunday Times. Women in the UK spend a staggering £56 million a year on anti-cellulite products . Laser beams then transmit energy . sideways from the rod to smooth out lumpy fat cells and heat dermal . tissue. The method promotes skin thickening and tightening, resulting in . tighter, smoother skin. The laser directly targets the structure of . cellulite. As well as destroying the lumps, it stimulates collagen production just below the surface, and, in most cases, gives a smoother result than anything previously achieved by other anticellulite treatments. The Cellulaze laser fiber claims to level . out bumps of fat, treat dimples by releasing the fibrous bands that . pull down on the skin, and stimulate collagen production to increase skin’s . depth and elasticity for a smoother look. Liquefied fat is then pressed out. Hassan Shaaban, a consultant plastic . surgeon at the Sthetix clinic in Liverpool, was the British pioneer, and . has now become the principal specialist training other doctors from . across Europe in the technique. He . warns that not every patient will benefit. 'We classify cellulite . severity from one to four,' he says. 'This treatment works best on . stages two and three. In other words, women with serious cellulite will . first have to lose fat by other methods.' Wraps and massages can only go so far . The physician will mark the areas of cellulite to be treated with a marker . A couple of small incisions will be made, about the size of the tip of a pen . Local anesthesia or numbing solution is used (you'd be awake during the procedure) The Cellulaze laser fiber is threaded through a very small tube and inserted through the incision . Treatment involves a local anaesthetic and mild sedation, followed by the insertion of a laser rod . The cosmetic surgeon Angelica Kavouni, of the Cadogan Clinic in London, underwent the training last December and has already treated 15 women. 'I am cautiously optimistic that it works, but I think most patients will also have to make lifestyle changes such as diet and more exercise to maintain the results,' she told the Sunday Times. If you’re prepared to go down the invasive route to reduce those lumps and bumps - and you don't mind investing £2,500 for a year of silky smooth thighs - then this laser-powered treatment may be worth a go.

Diana Mager, 33, was being treated at Green Parks House psychiatric unit in Orpington, Kent, after suffering a severe form of post-natal depression after giving birth to Sofia in November 2011. The HSBC risk manager, who was self-harming and battling chronic anxiety, was admitted in June 2012 but committed suicide in August, at a time when she was being checked every 15 minutes. Couple: Diana Mager, 33, pictured on her wedding day with her husband Adam, 39. She died last August . She killed herself when she was alone. Earlier on in her stay she had been allowed out on occasions for an hour at a time - but had once tried to jump off the Tate Modern building in central London. Her husband, IT consultant Adam, 39, is now planning legal action against Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, reported the London Evening Standard. Mr Mager, who also claimed that his wife once smuggled a kitchen knife into the hospital unit, told the newspaper: ‘Diana was overjoyed at becoming a mother - it was all she ever wanted. ‘I believe she would be alive today if she had received the proper care she desperately needed.  Instead, I have to explain to our daughter why her mother is no longer with us.’ Sad case: Diana Mager (left) killed herself when she was alone at Green Parks House (right) in Orpington, Kent . The death of Mrs Mager, who had a history of depression, is being outlined in an inquest which was opened yesterday. It will also highlight a lack of specialist care for post-natal depression. 'I have to explain to our daughter why her mother is no longer with us' Adam Mager, husband of Diana Mager . Mr Mager’s lawyer, Mark Bowman of Field Fisher Waterhouse, based in Aldgate, east London, said his client was ‘concerned that more could and should have been done to help her’. Trust chief executive Stephen Firn said in a statement to MailOnline: ‘I was deeply saddened by Mrs Mager’s death and would like to express my sincere condolences to her husband and family. ‘We carried out a full and thorough investigation which concluded that it could not have been predicted or prevented.' The trust said it could not comment further while the inquest is ongoing at South London Coroner's Court in Croydon. It is being held by Coroner Dr Roy Palmer and is expected to finish next Monday. Post-natal depression usually . develops in the first four to six weeks after childbirth, although in . some cases it may not develop for several months. There . are many symptoms, such as low mood, feeling unable to cope and . difficulty sleeping, but many women are not aware they have the . condition. It is . common for women to experience mood changes and episodes of tearfulness . after giving birth which is sometimes known as the 'baby blues' but . these normally clear up within a few weeks. If a woman experiences persistent symptoms, it could be the result of post-natal depression. The . cause is not completely clear and experts think it is the result of a . combination of things including lack of support, money worries or a . difficult delivery. But even if someone's life is free of these kind of problems, a woman can still develop post-natal depression. People . often assume they will naturally adapt to parenthood but it can take . months before people begin to cope with the pressures of being a parent. Factors that increase . your risk of having postnatal depression include a family history of . depression or post-natal depression or experiencing other mood disorders . such as bipolar disorder. Huge changes in hormone levels during and after pregnancy were once believed to be the sole cause of post-natal depression. This is no longer thought to be the case, although hormonal changes may still play a part.","Diana Mager, 33, was being treated at Green Parks House in Kent .

Bulked up: Mail On Sunday reporter Hannah Ellis-Petersen at the Glenfield Hospital trying out their new 'fat suit' We are a country lumbering towards an epidemic of obesity, with six out of ten adults classed as clinically overweight. Now, in a sign that Britain is facing up to the problem, an NHS hospital has purchased ‘fat suits’ to teach nurses and doctors how to handle, and empathise with, the morbidly obese. The £800 polyester ‘bariatric suit’ weighs just over a stone and allows the wearer to fully experience the bulk of obese bodies by mimicking the proportions of someone weighing 28 stone. The Mail on Sunday tried out the suit and soon discovered that simple tasks such as dressing or getting up from the floor can be considerably more difficult than those who are not obese might imagine. The suits are being used in Leicester, where 350 patients weighing between 20st and 51st have been admitted to hospital in the past four years. But even with obesity putting a £5.1 billion financial strain on the NHS every year, some critics say the equipment is an unnecessary luxury. Local Conservative councillor Ross Grant said: ‘It is well intentioned I am sure, but I am a bit dubious about how effective and essential this suit is for the NHS. ‘Obesity is an issue that does need addressing, but money might be better spent on frontline services that directly tackle the problem.’ Nick Howlett, who has run Leicester’s patient mobility unit for 15 years, says the suit helps staff learn how to lift obese people safely and assist them with walking and sitting up in bed. He adds: ‘As it is inappropriate to practise the procedures on real obese patients, it was very difficult to visualise how you would move somebody of that size. ‘Now this suit means we can have a model where we can practically demonstrate all the safe lifting procedures.’ But the suit also has another purpose: allowing the doctors and nurses of Leicester to experience the challenges of being obese first-hand. ‘Empathy for the obese patients can be a really difficult problem,’ Mr Howlett added. ‘Obesity is the last acceptable discrimination and we do actually find that can be an issue. ‘The fact is, staff really don’t know how to cope. But wearing this suit will aid their understanding of the struggles faced by the obese. ‘It is my belief that this is going to have a tremendous effect on the way we view and treat the patients.’ War on weight: Reporter Hannah Ellis-Petersen before, left, at her usual weight and trying out the bariatric suit with difficult, right . I took up the challenge of trying out the bariatric suit at the Glenfield Hospital in Leicester. Wearing it, my 9 ½ st build was transformed into the frame of a much larger patient. ‘I should warn you, this suit may make you feel a little uncomfortable after a while,’ cautioned Mr Howlett as he buttoned me up. This was something of an understatement. It is difficult to exaggerate how becoming three times wider impacted on almost every aspect of my mobility. I struggled to walk as the extra padding round my legs forced me into an awkward and slow waddle. Spatially unaware of my new width, navigating a narrow bathroom proved even more of a logistical nightmare as I found myself uncomfortably wedged between a sink and a hand-dryer. I lost my balance putting on my shoes, as I could not see my feet over the folds of polyester ‘fat’, while my attempts to dress myself in a pair of custom-made jeans proved an impossible farce. Staff aid: The fat suits are supposed to help doctors and nurses learn how to handle overweight patients . However, the ultimate trial came when I was challenged to demonstrate what Mr Howlett described as the ‘nightmare situation’, when an obese patient falls out of their bed on to the floor. As I lay immobile and sweating, struggling to get to my feet, the novelty of my newly acquired bulk had most certainly worn off. It took me more than ten minutes of intense struggling and laboured breathing, legs flailing in the air, to eventually roll over from my back and heave my considerable bulk upright – an experience that proved both uncomfortable and quite humiliating. Mr Howlett was adamant that the product would prove its worth to staff in almost every field across the NHS trust. He said: ‘I started this service in 1998 and the first year I probably saw one patient above 32 stone. ‘Fifteen years later, we are now seeing somewhere in excess of 150 patients of this size every year.’","NHS hospital has purchased 'fat suits' to help staff understand obesity .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . PUBLISHED: . 03:27 EST, 31 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:25 EST, 31 May 2013 . An amateur explorer from Edinburgh has begun a 60-day mission living on a remote island off the coast of Scotland stuck inside a converted eight-foot water tank. Nick Hancock is hoping to set two endurance records by living on the 100ft island of Rockall and raise £10,000 for the Help for Heroes charity. But as he started his mission, he admitted his wife Pamela told him she and their 18-month-old son, Freddie, didn't want him to go. Rockall is situated 225 miles west of the Outer Hebrides chain and is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of Atlantic swell. Nick Hancock, a 38-year-old chartered surveyor from Edinburgh sets off on his 60-day mission to live on the remote Scottish islet of Rockall inside the yellow, eight-foot converted water tank . Hancock used a diesel-powered winch to lift his homemade 'rockpod' on to the Kilda cruise boat. The journey to the Scottish islet of Rockall - 225 miles west from the Outer Hebrides - took 12 hours. The eight-foot converted water bowser was fitted with hatches and fixing points so Hancock can fix it island's rocks . Explorer Nick Hancock will be taking nearly half a tonne of equipment with him during his 60-day stint on the islet of Rockall, including: . 60 days' food . Fishing kit and bait . Pants and socks x 10 . Comfy shoes . Insect collection kit . Normal LW radio for news . Weather station . Brass Plaque . Whisky and cask . Emergency water maker . Lip balm . Binoculars . Loo rolls (average of one per week) Ear plugs . Harmonicas and lesson book . Flags . Sunglasses . Satellite phone . Laptop . The world's largest recorded oceanic waves of over 95 feet were recorded there in 2000 - 19 feet higher than Rockall itself. Because Rockall is so remote only four people have ever slept on it and less than 100 people have ever landed on it. But Mr Hancock, 38, a chartered surveyor, created a yellow living pod from an eight-foot water tank, and made it cosy with spray-on insulation foam in a bid to spend 60 days on Rockall. He recently won £3,500 from the Kukri Adventure Scholarship - following a presentation at the Royal Geographical Society in London - to help his bid. The current record for time spent on . Rockall is 40 days, back in 1985 - when ex-SAS soldier Tom McClean lived . on the rock from 26 May to 4 July - to affirm Britain's claim to the . islet. Mr Hancock, who previously stayed for a shorter expedition on the islet, hopes to break the record on the rock to raise money for Help For Heroes. Hancock said from his home town of Ratho on Thursday: 'Decision made - we're going for Rockall today. He plans to spend 60 days on the island inside this eight foot water tank that he converted . 'I am ready for what lies ahead - both mentally and physically, but it is more a mental challenge. 'I am as prepared as I can be. I have enough rations and I am looking forward to it and setting new records for Rockall. Yet Mr Hancock isn't planning to make a habit of these adventures: 'It may be the last! Who knows? I'm just concentrating on this one for now. Landing on it is tricky.' The journey to the islet takes around . 12-hours and Mr Hancock, a climber and marathon runner, was ferried . over there aboard a boat from local operator Kilda Cruises. Nick Hancock will live on the isolated 100ft island of Rockall inside an eight foot water tank that he has converted to be inhabitable . Hancock used a diesel-powered winch to lift the 'rockpod' onto the boat, he will then bolt it onto the islet to secure it in place. 'It's a converted water bowser which has been fitted with hatches and fixing points so I can fix it to the rock. 'I have a daily routine of exercises and safety checks, and I'm also going to be carrying out some sample collections for St Andrew's University and the Hunterian Museum. Hancock admitted he did not want to be 'stuck' inside his survival pod too much but the weather may force him to. He can only walk a few feet outside of the narrow ledge his home will be on. The isolated island of Rockall in the Outer Hebrides  is a 100ft wide and can attract waves of up to 95 feet high . Rockall is a formidable opponent for any adventurer, located 225 miles west of the Outer Hebrides and surrounded by choppy water . 'I will exercise and I am taking an . exercise band for resistance training,' said Mr Hancock. 'I will also . have a lot of ebooks on my laptop to read. 'I feel confident that I am ready for this amazing adventure.' The majority of Hancock's equipment and supplies were packed into plastic drums and were donated by Smiths of Dean. Before the trip, Hancock said: 'I fully expect that I will have to repack several times to ensure I know where everything is, but otherwise I feel confident that I will be ready in a month's time for this amazing adventure.' The expedition is being sponsored by Calor Gas which also provided a stove and the LPG needed to cook. Hancock was ferried to the remote Scottish islet during a 12-hour journey aboard a boat from local operator Kilda Cruises. He is leaving his wife Pamela and 18-month-old son, Freddie, for two months to raise £10,000 for Help the Heroes charity. Hancock plans to spend the time . learning harmonica and said he hoped to become 'as good as Larry Adler' - . the late American master, who collaborated with Elton John and Sting - . when he leaves Rockall. 'At least I won't drive anybody else crazy with my playing,' he said. Mr Hancock want to set both the longest solo occupation of Rockall and the longest occupation in its history. 'I will be surviving off less than 2500 calories a day and consuming military-style boil-in-the-bag rations. 'I am looking forward to it and I am not nervous. I have done all the preparations I can.' In 2011 TV adventurer Ben Fogle said he wanted to lead an exhibition to 'reclaim' Rockall for Britain. 'I once tried to invade Rockall, unsuccessfully, and have first-hand experience of the ridiculousness of Rockall's size and the recklessness of attempting a landing. It is a realm of the sea, a kingdom governed only by the weather,' he said. The majority of Hancock's equipment and supplies were packed into plastic drums and were donated by Smiths of Dean. Hancock plans to spend the time learning harmonica and said he hoped to become 'as good as Larry Adler' - the late American master, who collaborated with Elton John and Sting - when he leaves Rockall . 'Nick's attempt to not only land, but stay for 60 days and raise money for a very worthy charity is an apt gesture for an island so immersed in eccentricity.' Survival expert Bear Grylls added that it was 'an ambitious, exciting - and wonderfully mad - project, but in aid of a life-changing charity that needs our help.' Belgian radio enthusiasts landed on the remote North Atlantic islet - Britain's loneliest outpost - in October 2011 and transmitted for more than 15 hours. The island is the core of an eroded volcano that erupted around 55 million years ago. The rock is 100ft wide and 70ft high and in the past Ireland, Iceland and Denmark have lain claim to Rockall and to the possible oil and gas reserves surrounding it. Even TV adventurer Ben Fogle failed to land Rockall and he has praised Mr Hancock for the attempt . Ownership is now being examined by the United Nations in the light of competing claims from Iceland, the Faroes and Ireland. The earliest recorded landing on Rockall was believed to be in 1810, by an officer called Basil Hall from the HMS Endymion. In 2011 an adventurer dramatically cancelled his attempt to land on Rockall to reaffirm the UK's ownership of it - after half his team suddenly quit two days into the expedition. Andy Strangeway wanted to put a new plaque on Rockall to replace the one that was left in 1955 in what was the last territorial expansion of the British Empire. Yorkshireman Mr Strangeway also had to cancel a bid in 2010 to reach Rockall after there was a hold-up in getting the islet's first planning permission from the Western Isles Council - the nearest local authority. The Royal Navy annexed Rockall in 1955 and the Island Of Rockall Act 1972 declared it part of the Western Isles. Its exact position was first charted by Royal Navy surveyor Captain ATE Vidal in 1831. But it was on September 18, 1955, that the island was officially annexed by the British Crown when three marines - Lieutenant-Commander Desmond Scott, Sergeant Brian Peel and Corporal AA Fraser - and civilian naturalist James Fisher were deposited on the island by a Royal Navy helicopter. The team cemented in a brass plaque on Hall's Ledge and hoisted the Union Flag to stake the UK's claim. During his reconnaissance trip last June, Mr Hancock did unfurl a Union Jack and tweeted on Twitter: 'Happy jubilee Your Majesty' but did, however, lose some equipment during his brief stay. The occupiable area of Rockall, named in 1955 as Hall's Ledge after the first recorded person to land there, is just 11 feet x 4 feet, and is just 13 feet below the summit. There are no trees or bushes on the rock - just algae, seaweeds and one black lichen. Just over 20 species of sea bird and only six species of animal have been recorded on or near Rockall.","Nick Hancock will spend live on the 100ft-wide island of Rockall .

The divorced author from Martha's Vineyard became the central character in her own mystery after receiving a love letter written in code in the mail. 'I'm always looking for wonderful mysteries and this seemed to be one,' Ms Riggs said, adding that the only details the code came with was a set of co-ordinates. Scroll down for video: . Mystery: Cynthia Riggs unexpectedly received a coded letter, with no details other than a set of co-ordinates . Happily ever after: The code led to a reunion for Cynthia Riggs and Howard Attebery, who married last week . It was a mystery that took the author . back 60 years, to when she worked at a San Diego marine laboratory with a . young man named Howard Attebery. When Ms Riggs tracked Dr Attebery down in California he admitted to sending the note. In a final twist to the story, Dr Attebery confessed his love for Ms Riggs and the couple married last weekend. Although they never dated when they worked together, the pair used to pass coded messages to each other at the laboratory, using a simple formula where A is substituted for B and so on. Ms Riggs said the notes were just office banter, adding: 'I would say something like, ""Did you see that Don found a copepod in his sample?"".' She told CBS: 'I liked him a lot but I didn't see any romantic interest in it'. Dr Attebery however, adored his co-worker and kept all of the notes she passed him. Because he was sure Ms Riggs did not feel the same way, he never asked her out - until he was 90 years old. Second chance: Cynthia Riggs and Howard Attebery met at a marine laboratory in California 60 years ago . Mementos: Howard Attebery kept all the coded notes the pair used to send to each other at the laboratory . The co-workers both went on to marry other people. After the death of his wife, Dr Attebery stayed single for a long time, before finally plucking up the courage to track down Ms Riggs. And, after years of not knowing how to tell her how he felt, Dr Attebery's coded message read: 'I have never stopped loving you'. The pair exchanged letters for about a year before meeting and, when they were finally reunited in California, he proposed within an hour. 'You know, love is a great place to spend the rest of your life,' he said. While the couple were writing to each other they realized that despite their time apart they had plenty in common, including the heartbreak of losing a child. When Dr Attebery sent her a photograph . he had taken in Sedona, Arizona. Ms Riggs sent back a poem written by her . late daughter, Mary, called Meeting My Father in Sedona. Dr Attebery wrote back to say his son . had died 'at the same time your daughter died and at the same age. It . was a moment right away,' Ms Riggs told the Vineyard Gazette. Ms Riggs, who comes from a family that has produced generations of Martha's Vineyard sea captains, was also married and has five children. She divorced after 25 years, and said her abusive husband stalked her for several years afterwards, before finally taking his own life. 'After that,' she said, 'I said never, never, never again. And then this appears out of nowhere. It is just plain magical.' Romance: Cynthia Riggs, who writes thrillers, was surprised to be at the center of a real-life mystery . Love story: The newlyweds will live in the Martha's Vineyard home of Cynthia Riggs . The author of crime books set in her home town added: 'Life is just amazing. Donâ€™t give up hope. This is not what I expected at all.' 'Really, how much time do we have? But you know, it really makes that amount of time precious.' In March, Dr Attebery and his son Mark, who teaches in New York, packed up his belongings in San Diego and headed to Martha's Vineyard where the couple had a commitment ceremony, according to the Vineyard Gazette.

A dying man was left receiving electric shocks to his heart for several hours from a 'zapper' implant that doctors didn't know how to switch off. Francis Woods, 67, died at home after a short battle with tonsil cancer, but medics failed to turn off his Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) for several hours. The 'heart-zapper' implant delivers life-saving electric shocks if it detects an irregular heart rate - but can cause painful jolts when left active in dying patients. Francis Woods (with wife Eileen) continued receiving painful electric shocks to his heart for several hours from a 'zapper' implant that medics didn't know how to switch off . An out-of-hours GP came to Mr Woods' house in Partington, Greater Manchester, after he had discharged himself from St Ann's Hospice in Heald Green, Stockport - but didn't know how to deactivate the device. The implant had been installed at Wythenshawe Hospital but bosses admitted they couldn't provide the doctor with clear information on how to de-activate it. The trust has its own guidelines for switching off ICDs on patients in hospital but they do not apply for patients who choose to die at home or in a hospice under the Liverpool Care Pathway. Switching off the device involves . holding a specialist magnet over the ICD, which temporarily closes a . magnetic switch incorporated in it. To turn it off permanently, the device has to then be reprogrammed remotely using a 'wand' attached to a computer. The British Heart Foundation . published official guidelines in 2009 recommending that health . professionals have a 'responsibility' to ensure any implanted device is . de-activated in patients close to the point of death. Mr Woods, 67, died at home after a short battle with tonsil cancer, but medics failed to turn off his Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) for several hours, says his widow . Mr Woods' widow Eileen, 65, held talks . with hospital chiefs following her husband's death in June 2011 and was . told that new guidelines were being put in place to prevent such an . incident happening again. But two years on, the guidelines have yet to be implemented by the Greater Manchester and Cheshire Cardiac Network, which is responsible for integrating cardiac care between hospitals, GPs and other health organisations in the region. Health bosses have admitted that 'more training and education' was needed and that re-organisation of the NHS had slowed down the introduction of official guidelines. Mrs Woods says she has now complained after becoming frustrated that 'no lessons have been learned' from her husband's death two years ago. Two years on, Mrs Woods is angry that guidelines put in place to prevent such an incident happening again have not been implemented . She said: 'My main concern after his death was to make sure this wouldn't happen to other patients and I was satisfied at the time because I felt my concerns would help shape this new policy. But there seems to have been next to no movement on the issue and now I feel like I was just being kept quiet. 'From my experience these guidelines are badly needed and it shocks me that it's taken so long. 'Because my husband was unconscious, I can't know if he was experiencing pain - I'll never know - but it's not something that should be allowed to happen. 'It was his choice and his right to die at home, but after making that decision we were not given the support we needed to make sure he was allowed a peaceful passing.' A Wythenshawe Hospital spokesman said:'""Our ICD specialist nurse discussed deactivation of the ICD with the hospice. Mr Woods was sent home before this happened, and then deteriorated. 'A physician attended his home and contacted the hospital, but could not get the clearest of information [from the hospital] about magnet application to deactivate the ICD as this took place out of hours. 'The new guidelines from the network will give clearer details for physicians about magnet application, and where to get these magnets if necessary. The intention is that the ICDs are switched off before the patient gets to this stage.' A spokeswoman for the Greater Manchester . and Cheshire Cardiac Network said: 'The network has been working on an . implementation plan and the intention is to launch the policy over the . coming months and work with clinicians to agree how they will take it . forward.'","Francis Woods, 67, died at home after a short battle with tonsil cancer .

Graphic images of the blood-soaked bathroom where the runner shot his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp appeared in the media earlier this week. Now former detective Hilton Botha, who was dropped from the investigation after it emerged he is facing two counts of attempted murder in a separate incident, says the revelation could scupper the prosecution case.

Criticism: Former South African detective Hilton Botha came under fire for walking over the crime scene without foot protection . He believes they were taken by a corrupt policeman within 48 hours of the fatal incident at Pistorius's house in Pretoria, South Africa, on Valentine's Day. The graphic images showed a blood-soaked bathroom where Reeva Steenkamp was shot by Oscar Pistorius . Botha told the Sunday People: 'It looks like the pictures have been taken one or two days after the scene because on the Saturday (following the shooting) I took it down and sent it away for forensics. 'This is why I took the door down. I knew that anyone could come in and take pictures and both our cases could be b******d.' Botha said he had heard money was being offered for pictures of the scene. He believes they were taken by a mobile phone camera and shown to the Pistorious defence team before official crime scene pictures were revealed to lawyers. In the gruesome images, pools of blood cover the toilet and bathroom floor, with police tape marking the holes where bullets flew . through the bathroom door, which is missing a panel. It is thought that the low position of . the bullet holes will be used by Pistorius's defence team to argue that . he was not wearing his prosthetic legs at the time of the shooting, so . could not have planned the murder. The pictures, obtained by Sky News, also . show trails of blood leading from the bathroom and down the stairs of . the house, as the paralympian carried Miss Steenkamp's body and called . for help. The Sky footage also shows bloodied . footprints - thought to have been caused by investigating officer Hilton . Botha walking into the house without protective covers on his shoes. Pistorius, 26, known as the Blade Runner, denies murder but admits shooting Reeva through the bathroom door believing her to be an intruder. He is back in court on Tuesday for his next bail hearing. The investigation into 29-year-old Miss Steenkamp's death has been heavily criticised. Botha was forced to step down . when it emerged he faced seven charges of attempted murder for a 2011 . case in which he and two other officers fired on a vehicle in an attempt . to make it stop. He told the Sunday People that when he first began investigating the killing he knew of two potential key witnesses who have since been scared off talking to police. Model: Reeva Steenkamp was shot to death in the bathroom at Pistorius's home . He said: 'They changed their minds. It sounds to me like someone spoke to them and they don't want to get involved.'

Working out the calories in a slice of cake or the fat in a portion of fries is now easier than ever thanks to Google's new nutritional search feature. The launch will allow diet-conscious surfers to discover nutritional information including the fat, carbohydrate and salt content of over 1,000 foods in a click of a button. A blog post by Google explained that it could be difficult to make sensible food choices and that the new tool will help us make better food choices: 'We’re hoping we can make those . choices a little bit easier: starting today you will be able to quickly . and easily find extensive nutrition information for over 1,000 fruits, . vegetables, meats and meals in search.' Thanks to Google's new feature, surfers will be able to find clear and detailed nutritional information about over 1,000 foods by typing in keywords . Food for thought: The feature will provide comprehensive information about a specific food and even tell you if you are close to getting your recommended daily allowance of a particular nutrient . 'From the basics of potatoes and carrots to more complex dishes like burritos and chow mein, you can simply ask, “How much protein is in a banana?” or “How many calories are in an avocado?” and get your answer right away.' 'You'll hear the answer to your specific . question, see relevant nutrition information under an expansion, and be . able to switch to other related foods or serving sizes.' The blog post goes on to explain that the new nutritional information . builds on work on the Knowledge Graph. The graph uses Google's search results along with information from a wide range of websites to give searchers detailed and specific information about a particular topic, all in one place. As part of the nutritional information roll out, the graph helps connect related subjects, even in cases when those foods have a completely . different sounding name from what you asked. By typing or even talking into a microphone on your laptop or mobile phone, a person can look up hundreds of different foods. The feature is being rolled out across the U.S. over the next ten days . For . example, if you ask about nutritional information concerning 'summer squash carbs', Google will include 'zucchini' as a relevant food in the dropdown, because it is a type of summer . squash. The blog post added: 'Over time we’ll be adding more features, foods, and languages. You can even find out the nutritional information of food before and after they are cooked, such here when corn is fresh as well as when it has been popped.

Snowfall has caused the  closure of many schools and if the poor weather continues, they will remain shut next week. But why do we educate our children in schools? I think we have lost sight of their purpose, and the cold snap gives us a chance to think afresh. While at home, the children can catch up on the news on Jimmy Savile and his depravities, cyclist Lance Armstrong, who deceived the world with his drug-taking, and Katie Price, the good-time girl who last week married a man on the advice of a psychic. These and other ‘characters’ like them exert huge influence on the nation. In truth, they are just paper-thin personalities. The rot set in with the publication of Dale Carnegie’s How To Win Friends And Influence People in 1936, which put superficial personality skills above deeper virtues. It opened the cult of the personality, where  people are judged not by who they are but how they present themselves. Helping pupils flourish: Master of Wellington College Anthony Seldon . We can trace good character traits back to the Greek philosopher, Aristotle, who argued that society will flourish only when we develop the virtues of our young. Traditional values include courage, resilience, loyalty, honesty, kindness, respect, responsibility and self-control. To these we might add everyday qualities: politeness, punctuality, good manners. Studies show that these can be taught, and that they endure throughout life. Families have a role to play, but so do schools. Last year, the University of Birmingham founded the Jubilee Centre to study the development of good character. The research shows conclusively that good character traits are better predictors of academic and economic success and happiness than raw IQ. In the US, a branch of schools called Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) focus on developing character, with high success rates. Each child is given a ‘character report card’, designed to show their traits improving over time. Developing character requires teachers to emphasise positive virtues, and to model them. Self-control is learnt through exercises that reward endurance, such as long hikes. Assemblies must highlight good behaviour and students should be trusted and taught to distinguish right from wrong. Older pupils should be given real responsibilities. Kindness must be emphasised, and all students given chances to volunteer and serve others. 'Characters' like Katie Price exert a huge influence on the nation . But the Government cares only for improving academic standards, measured by the passing of exams. Don’t get me wrong, high standards are  fundamental, and Education Secretary Michael Gove and Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw are changing the landscape of British schooling. But their vision is sadly incomplete. The obsession with exams has caused schools to narrow what they offer, because teachers know they are being judged on academic results alone. The Government wants a ‘Big Society’ and strong communities. They have initiated a ‘decade of social action’, and  the National Citizen Service, a voluntary programme for 16-year-olds. All excellent, but too little. Just this week, we have heard that parents are raising children ‘in captivity’ because of paranoia about safety: rather than facing character-forming challenges, they are mollycoddled. Meanwhile, Baroness Meacher suggests changes to current drugs laws. As a headmaster who has seen pupils die from drugs, we need to do far more to help our young have the character to say ‘no’. We cannot leave it to families. Does the Government really think employers and universities want people who can pass tests, but lack the ability to think creatively, or the discipline to contribute? Protest about the lack of character in school leavers is rising to a cacophony. At my own school, Wellington College, our young must abide by five values which they themselves chose: courage, integrity, kindness, responsibility and respect. They are taught self-control and endurance; working in teams on the games field and in the cadet force, learning to overcome their limitations and obey instructions. Since we started teaching well-being five years ago, where pupils learn to develop resilience, exam performance has rocketed – from 65 per cent A and B grades at A-level to 93 per cent. Listen Mr Gove! The Government's obsession with exam results is damaging young people for life . But it is not just independent schools. From Kings Langley School in Hertfordshire to the Science Academy in Bradford, the best state schools are concentrating on character, with startling success. King Solomon Academy in London, which has a strong uniform code, celebrates good manners, and teaches each child to aspire, has been transformed in just a few years. Governments want to show that they have significantly bolstered results and league table performance. But society has a longer time-frame, and needs young people to become kind, law-abiding, creative citizens. On Wednesday, I am giving a lecture at the Jubilee Centre on the neglect of character education in our schools, and how this is selling society short. The Government is damaging young people for life because of its obsession with exam results – and making a mockery of its claim to be building a Big Society. Listen, please, Mr Gove!","We have lost sight of the purpose of schools, says master of Wellington College Anthony Seldon ."

Deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest has caused the seeds of palm trees to become smaller - because large, fruit-eating birds have been driven out, researchers have found. The disappearance of toucans and cotingas, which were once abundant in the rainforest and spread seeds through their droppings, means that palm trees have no way to distribute their bigger seeds, the Brazilian researchers said. They believe the changes could be disastrous to the palm trees that once thrived in the forests. Deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest has caused the seeds of palm trees to become smaller - because large, fruit-eating birds  - such as the channel billed toucan - have been driven out . Toucanets also play a fundamental role in the forest as seed dispersers of large seeds . In general, researchers estimate that . human activity, such as deforestation, drives species to extinction . about 100 times faster than natural evolutionary processes. However, few studies have . successfully documented such rapid evolutionary changes in ecosystems . that have been modified by human activity. Galetti and his colleagues used patches of rainforest that had . been fragmented by coffee and sugar cane development during the 1800's . to set up their natural experiment. They collected more than 9,000 seeds from 22 different palm tree populations and found that in patches of forests deserted by large birds such as toucans and large cotingas - because of deforestation - palms produced significantly smaller seeds. 'Small seeds are more vulnerable to desiccation and cannot withstand . projected climate change,' explained Galetti. But, smaller birds . such as thrushes that populate the fragmented patches of forest are . unable to swallow and disperse large seeds. As a result of this, palm regeneration became less successful in the area, with . less-vigorous seedlings germinating from smaller seeds. In undisturbed patches of forest, large-gaped birds  - whose beaks are 12mm wide or more - still make their homes and palms continue . to produce large seeds, successfully dispersed by the birds through their droppings, the researchers found. Only large-gaped birds, such as toucans and cotingas, can disperse large seeds . They then determined that the . absence of large, seed-dispersing birds in the area was the main reason . for the palm seeds shrinking in size - and this shrinkage could have taken place within 100 years of an initial disturbance. They say their findings provide evidence that human activity can trigger fast-paced . evolutionary changes in natural populations. Recent research has found that toucans regulate body temperature by adjusting the flow of blood to their beak. More blood flow means more heat is released. When toucans sleep, they tuck their beak under their feathers to keep them warm. Toco toucans also use their beaks to pluck and peel fruit, their main source of food. In addition, the beak houses a flat tongue of the same length, which helps the toucan catch insects, frogs, and reptiles. 'Unfortunately, the effect we document in our work is probably not an isolated case,' said Galetti. He is also concerned that small seeds are 'more vulnerable to . desiccation and cannot withstand projected climate change'. Long . periods of drought and increasingly warmer climate (as predicted by . climate model projections for South America) could be particularly . harmful to tropical tree populations that depend on animals to disperse . their seeds. 'Habitat loss and species extinction is causing drastic changes in the composition and structure of ecosystems, because critical ecological interactions are being lost,' said Galetti. 'This involves the loss of key ecosystem functions that can determine evolutionary changes much faster than we anticipated. 'Our work highlights the importance of identifying these key functions to quickly diagnose the functional collapse of ecosystems.' The study is published in the journal Science.","Deforestation of Brazilian rainforest has caused the seeds of palm trees to shrink - because birds like toucans and cotingas have been driven out .

Scientists have discovered pebbles on Mars, showing that a stream has flowed on the planet - and giving more weight to the theory that it was once able to support life. The rounded pebbles found by the team from Nasa's Curiosity rover mission, and published in journal Science today, are only formed when they are carried through water over long distances, according to the researchers. It is the first time that evidence of sustained water flows on Mars has been uncovered. The individual stones in the area are rounded like pebbles on Danish shores and were probably transported down through a ravine, Peace Vallis, which is carved in the southern slope of the northern crater wall . The images are  taken by the spectroscopic stereo camera, Mastcam, at an angle from a vantage point two meter above the Martian ground and therefore gives a slightly distorted image of the size of the stones depending on their location in the image field. The further away you look, the greater the distortion of the size of the stones in the image. The Danish researchers from the Niels Bohr Institute, together with a German collaborator and the camera team built a system that can rectify the image so that sizes are directly comparable. Dawn Sumner, a geologist at University of California, Davis, said the discovery of the pebbles - which were laid down more than two billion years ago - was due to choosing the right place for Curiosity to land. She said: 'The main reason we chose Gale Crater as a landing site was to look at the layered rocks at the base of Mount Sharp, about five miles away. 'We knew there was an alluvial fan in the landing area, a cone-shaped deposit of sediment that requires flowing water to form. 'These sorts of pebbles are likely because of that environment. So while we didn't choose Gale Crater for this purpose, we were hoping to find something like this.' The report authors noted that conditions on Mars at the time the pebbles were deposited were vastly different to the cold, dry environment of the present day if water was to flow over several kilometres. They added: 'These ancient fluvial deposits indicate sustained liquid water flows across the landscape - a finding that raises prospects for the former presence of habitable environments on Mars. More work needs to be carried out into the risks of radiation to astronauts wanting to take a closer look at the geography of the red planet ahead of any future missions to Mars however, according to a separate study published in Science today. The study area, which has been named 'Hottah', is by all accounts the remains of sediments from the bottom of an ancient stream, which had a relatively strong current . A radiation assessment detector (RAD) on board Curiosity during its 253-day journey to Mars made measurements of the environment inside the spacecraft, and its results could have important implications for manned missions. Cary Zeitlin of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said astronauts would be subject to a high dose of radiation - representing a large fraction of the amount that is acceptable over a lifetime. He said: 'In terms of accumulated dose, it's like getting a whole-body CT scan once every five or six days. Understanding the radiation environment inside a spacecraft carrying humans to Mars or other deep space destinations is critical for planning future crewed missions. 'Based on RAD measurements, unless propulsion systems advance rapidly, a large share of mission radiation exposure will be during outbound and return travel, when the spacecraft and its inhabitants will be exposed to the radiation environment in interplanetary space, shielded only by the spacecraft itself.' The report looked at the exposure to galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles that the spaceship experienced during the journey to Mars. Multiple outcroppings of rocks like this one (termed a pebble conglomerate) were observed along the first 275 meters traversed by the rover with the high-resolution Mastcam . Dr Zeitlin said a spacecraft carrying astronauts would have protection against solar particles, but that cosmic rays are much more difficult to stop. The next step will be to investigate radiation while on the surface of the planet itself, said Dr Zeitlin, who added this was critical in light of some of the proposed scenarios for Mars missions which envisaged astronauts spending up to 500 days on Mars. 'This issue will have to be addressed, one way or another, before humans can go into deep space for months or years at a time,' he said.","First time that evidence of sustained water flows on Mars has been uncovered .

Testing: Research has been carried out in an area named Eblana 1, or 'Nelly', which is adjacent to oil-rich Railroad Valley, which was the most productive oil well in the US for a decade . ‘We are looking at two oil systems: light sweet crude with gas condensate and the normal heavier oil that is found in Nevada,’ U.S. Oil and Gas CEO Brian McDonnell told Las Vegas channel KLAS-TV. ‘What we would need to do is a number of wells to actually define the geological structure and how much oil would be maintained in the geological structure.

A University professor jumped to his death from a campus parking garage after he was lured into sharing sexually explicit pictures with an underage girl online and then blackmailed by one of her relatives who orchestrated the elaborate scam, police said. A 37-year-old man, from Louisiana, is due to be arraigned in federal court today on a charge of using a phone and the Internet to extort money from Texas A&M University professor James Arnt Aune, 59. Aune, a married father-of-two who was also chair of the school's Department of Communications, committed suicide on the morning of January 8. Shortly before, he sent his alleged blackmailer a text message stating 'Killing myself now. And u will be prosecuted for blackmail' just one minute before he died. Scam: Texas A&M University professor James Arnt Aune, 59, committ suicide following a blackmail plot . According to an FBI affidavit, text and email conversations found on Aune's campus computer and iPhone showed the suspect had been threatening to call police and Aune's employers if he did not send him 'something like $5,000.' Aune transferred the alleged blackmailer $1,000 initially and promised to send more money in January, FBI investigators said in the document. According to Chron.com, the girl, who hasn't been named, told police the man took nude photos and videos of her and she and the man created a site on MocoSpace.com. Using a fake name and the email address pretty-gurl985@yahoo.com, the alleged blackmailer targeted men, got their phone numbers and sent them the sexually explicit photos and videos. He kept a list of the names and numbers of men they were setting out to extort. Under the plan, the suspect, who was charged in 2011 with aggravated incest and oral sexual battery for allegedly abusing the same female relative, would then call the men targeted by the scam, pretending to be an outraged father, and demand payment to cover the cost of counseling for his daughter. Sad: Aune, pictured, a married father of two who was also chair of the school's Department of Communications, committed suicide on the morning of January 8 . Blackmail: Aune, pictured center, sent his alleged blackmailer a text message stating 'Killing myself now. And u will be prosecuted for blackmail' one minute before he jumped to his death . In a series of text messages exchanged with Aune, he also claimed his daughter was transgender so especially vulnerable. 'It is very hard to help a teenage trans-gender child be accepted in life; to help her find a life worth living,' one of text messages the suspect allegedly sent to Aune said, according to Chron.com. 'And you came in with your disgusting (talking).' Over time, the texts from the alleged blackmailer to Aune became increasingly threatening. 'If I do not hear from you I swear to Gold Almighty that the police in your place of employment, students ALL OVER THE INTERNET ... ALL OF THEM will be able to see your conversations, text , pictures you sent,' stated one message. School: Aune was a professor and chair of the Department of Communications at Texas A&M University, pictured . 'And if by some miracle you get away with this I will use every chance I get to make sure every place or person associated with you knows and see what you have done. Last chance, you better make the right move.' The professor told his wife in mid December that he was being blackmailed after being caught up in an online sexual relationship with a minor, according to the FBI affidavit. On the morning of Aune's death, the suspected blackmailer contacted him at 9:21 a.m., giving him three hours to come up with the unknown sum of money or 'the calls start.' At 10:29 a.m. Aune replied: 'Killing myself now. And u will be prosecuted for blackmail.' A minute later, he jumped off the parking garage to his death, according to the FBI affidavit. The 37-year-old suspect was indicted last week.","Texas A&M University professor James Arnt Aune, 59, threw himself off a campus parking garage on January 8, 2013 .

Christmas travelers hitting the roads and skies this weekend face tornado warning in the South, severe downpours further north and a thick band of snowy conditions in the Midwest through the weekend. Major airport hubs from Dallas to Chicago, Atlanta, New York and Boston can expect to be affected by some extreme or another through Monday. Conditions will begin to calm down by the time the holiday finally rolls around Wednesday, with only parts of the northern Midwest expecting a white Christmas this year. Soaked: A Batman and some Los Angelenos walk through Hollywood as Southern California got a rare downpour Thursday. A different storm system is set to disrupt holiday travel starting Saturday as the Southeast prepares for severe rain and even tornadoes . Snowy: Traffic slowed to a crawl in Salt lake City Thursday as snow swept the area causing power outages and car accidents. As the weekend wears on, most of the snow will be focused in the northern Midwest states, where roads could be dangerous as holiday travelers prepare for Christmas . Heading to the islands? Even balmy Hawaii gets snow at its highest peaks, pictured here is the summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii . On Friday, snow will be the first sign of Christmas travel trouble as it ekes its way in from the Northwest. Into Friday night, much of the Great Lakes region and into southern Canada and New England will begin to see snow accumulate as much as 6 inches. Into Saturday, a warm front will fuel rains from Texas, though much of the Southeast and north through Appalachia and into New York State. Travel could get especially nasty in east Texas, Louisiana and north to the southern tip of Illinois, where severe thunderstorms are expected. Drenched: It won't be as unusual as it is in Los Angeles (pictured), but folks from Texas to southern Illinois can expect exceedingly wet conditions through the weekend . Dangerous: Millions of travelers are hitting the roads and skies this weekend. But Saturday, the weather calls fro dangerous thunderstorms in much of the South, with potential for tornadoes in some areas . Mixed bag: The outlook is good and bad on Friday, when travelers in the West and Southeast can expect good conditions, while the north and Southwest have a tough road ahead . Snow: A band of snow can be expected from Michigan to Maine on Friday, with more to come towards Christmas itself . Frigid: Wet snow falls in Salt Lake City on Thursday when a winter storm battered northern Utah causign power outages, traffic accidents, and the temporary shutdown of the Salt lake City airport . nasty: Much of the Great Lakes region can expect the same as Salt Lake City (pictured) into the weekend, threatening to interrupt holiday travel plans . A winter storm blasted the Wasatch Front resulting in numbers crashes including these two cars that collided during the treacherous drive in Salt Lake City on Thursday . Brave: A cyclist pedals across South Temple during a snowstorm in Salt Lake City on Thursday as winter storm blasted Utah's Wasatch Front . There is even potential for tornadoes in those areas through Saturday night. Even where tornado warnings are unlikely, the Southeast and much of the Midwest can expect to be drenched into Sunday. The East Coast can expect an unseasonably warm weekend with temperatures reaching the 60s. Remnants of the massive storm due to soak the center of the country will creep east and cause some rain closer to the coasts late in the weekend. The warm temperatures will melt away any East Coast snow left over from Thanksgiving, such as in Boston where residents spent the weekend blocking parking spaces they'd spent hours shoveling with things like trash bins, lawn chairs and vacuum cleaners. However, snow is in the forecast into the holiday week for much of Michigan and in parts of Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. White Christmas for some: As the east feels the last of the storm's rain into Wednesday, much of Michigan and the Great Lakes region will see a white Christmas along with Colorado and Kansas . Not the greatest: Travel will be better in the Midwest by Monday, conditions will remain poor on the east Coast and Northeast . I called it: Every winter, following a snow storm, the tradition of marking the parking space that one has shoveled with a disposable object continues in Boston neighborhoods. This most recent storm's snow will melt into the weekend as unseasonably warm weather moves across the East Coast . Savesies: A chair, spray painted with the home address number is left in a shoveled parking space on a public street in the South Boston neighborhood . Enjoy it while you can: An old vacuum is left in a shoveled parking space in the South Boston neighborhood. Rains will gradually replace the dry, warmth the East Coast can expect for the weekend . Bad reception: An old television set marks another parking spot in Boston. Arguments sometimes result over cleared public parking spaces including the arrest of a 32-year-old man in the alleged assault of a 66-year-old neighbor after the last snowfall .","Severe thunderstorms will hit a chunk of the southern U.S. along with the threat of tornadoes just as millions of travelers take to the roads and air for holiday travel this weekend .

His daily choolate-filled intake of 7,000 calories left him at a huge 35st 11lbs - and too obese to work. Incredible bulk: Paul Palmer weighed 36 stone and lost half his body weight after a bus company refused to employ him in case he broke the driver's seat . The only job offer he had was as a bus driver, but he was turned down when bosses saw him and told him he would break the seat. Paul, 37, a former bailiff, was so embarrassed that he decided he had to lose weight - and just 13 months later he is lighter by a remarkable 16st 11lbs. He's so pleased with his progress that he's now offering to help other overweight people beat the bulge by becoming a slimming guru. Paul, from Tiverton, Devon, said: 'I applied for nearly 1,000 jobs and the only call back I got was from a bus company. 'I went along to the interview and the man said I was a perfect candidate and under normal circumstances they would have given me a job - but they couldn't due to health and safety. 'Apparently I was too heavy for the chair. It was absolutely humiliating.

At . the peak of his girth, Paul spent £100 a week on . calorie-crammed takeaways and was recognised in the street by his pizza . delivery boy. As well as breakfasting on half a dozen Mars bars, he wolfed down a giant Cadbury Dairy Milk every day and washed it down with glass after glass of sugar-laden fizzy drinks. But after deciding to lose weight, he gave his diet a complete overhaul and started eatinghealthy salads, jacket potatoes and stir-fries. Paul said: 'I lost my job three years ago and it all went downhill from there. 'I suffered with depression, I comfort ate - chocolate, burgers, pizza - any takeaway meal I could lay my hands on. 'My favourite was Cadbury Dairy Milk, I could and would eat that by the truck load - I'm surprised I didn't put them out of business. 'It wasn't just Dairy Milk though, I would start by having around six Mars bars in the morning with a couple of cups of coffee.

'When I found out my true weight I realised I was in trouble. I didn't want my kids to grow up without a dad. 'I planned to lose 10 per cent of my body weight in three years so I could register for a gastric band but after one week at Slimming World I lost 12lbs. 'Within six months I had lost 10 per cent already so I just didn't stop, I became addicted to losing weight. 'It wasn't a diet, it was just healthy eating, and I was never hungry. 'When I started I literally couldn't move, but after eight weeks I would start exercising, walking round the block and things like that.

Some Python Challenge 2013 contestants have taken things literally as 21 snakes have now been bagged, with some being turned into actual bags. And belts and shoes and even pants. The first of its kind competition to see what brave hunter can wrangle the most Burmese pythons kicked off January 12 and some fashion forward Floridians will benefit along with the winner of the challenge. Slithering slacks: One possible fate for the snakes caught during Python Challenge 2013 is to become a pair of $1800 snakeskin pants . Brian Wood is a co-owner of Exotic Leather Fashions in Hollywood, Florida and he said the Python Challenge is the perfect opportunity to repurpose his company's expertise in harvesting, tanning and sewing alligator skins for handbags and other fine leather goods. 'The snakes have become a problem because they're invasive,' Wood told WPLG. 'It just seemed natural for us to go ahead and start buying the snakes from the hunters and utilizing them in our fashions.' Here's how it works: once hunters kill a python, usually with a gunshot to the brain, they turn the specimen over to officials at designated check stations where researchers gather biological information in the hopes of learning how to better combat the quickly reproducing nuisance species. Interested hunters may then retrieve their snake and take it on over to Exotic Leather Goods where Brian Wood is paying premium prices for pythons. Up to $150 each, though that's only for the best specimens. Tailored fit: A student from the University of Florida measures a dead Burmese python caught by Bill Booth of Bradenton, Fla. as part of the month-long 'Python Challenge.' From there, the pythons are skinned and some are dyed while others are left with their natural brownish colors and then the skins are turned into high fashion. For instance, they might be made into snakeskin pants. And if the idea of pants made out of serpent doesn't make you wince, the price tag might: these scaly slacks go for upwards of $1800 per pair. New threads: Brian Wood of Hollywood, Fla.'s Exotic Leather Fashions usually works with alligator, but he'll be making an exception during the Python Challenge . In addition to adding flair to the local look, Python Challenge 2013 exists to raise awareness about non-native species and their detrimental effects on the local ecosystem. While it's unknown how many pythons live in the Everglades, roughly 2,050 pythons have been harvested in Florida since 2000. Eleven snakes were caught in the first three days of the contest. Researchers say the large snakes menace . native wildlife and believe native creatures like raccoons and opossum . are fewer in number in areas the python is thought to live. Prized pythons: Bill Booth of Bradenton, Fla. holds a dead Burmese python he caught in the 'Python Challenge' Florida law prohibits possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets and they may only be legally transported if dead. Hunters . are restricted to four state wildlife management areas; Everglades . National Park is off-limits. They may use some firearms, as well as . captive bolts and machetes to kill pythons. Native species may not be . taken. The state is offering cash prizes to . whoever brings in the longest python and whoever bags the most pythons . by the time the competition ends at midnight Feb. 10.","One Florida shop owner is buying specimens to turn into high fashion, paying upwards of $150 per snake .

The widow of a Texas teacher shot dead in Libya earlier this month has said she has no hatred for his attackers and that she forgives them. As Anita Smith prepared for husband Ronnie's funeral in Austin today, she said the couple and their son had moved to Benghazi because they wanted to help the Libyans. Mr Smith, a chemistry teacher at an international school, was shot dead by unknown attackers as he jogged near their home on December 5. Forgiveness: Anita Smith says she feels no hatred for the Libyans who shot dead her husband . Grief: Anita Smith with Ronnie and their son. The couple had been together for 16 years before Ronnie was shot . In an open letter to the Libyans, written in Arabic, Mrs Smith wrote: 'I hear people speaking with hate, anger . and blame over Ronnie's death, but that's not what Ronnie would want.' 'Ronnie would want his death to be an opportunity for us to show one . another love and forgiveness, because that's what God has shown to us.' Mrs Smith told CBS the couple, who had been together for 16 years, knew there was a risk involved in being in Libya, but felt safe once there. 'We knew before going into Libya that . there was risk. We were doing this because we wanted to follow what God . has for us, and that's to show the Libyan people His love and His . forgiveness,' she said. The couple soon settled into life in Benghazi, making friends with their neighbors and learning to ignore the sound of bombing at night. 'It just was normal life ... It was even a joke within the city among the Libyan people just saying, ""Have you gotten used to the bombs?"",' she said. Adventure: Ronnie and Anita Smith on the plane to Libya, where Ronnie worked as a teacher . Mrs Smith had returned to the U.S. with the couple's son just before her husband was killed. He had been due to join them for a family Christmas just a few weeks later. No one has . claimed responsibility but the 33-year-old's death came days after an al . Qaeda chief urged Libyans to attack America as revenge for a U.S. special forces operation that snatched a terrorist suspect in Tripoli. '[Ronnie's] just been daily in my life all . these years, growing together. And just imagining the rest of life . without him, doesn't seem real,' Mrs Smith told CBS. But the Christian has managed to find forgiveness for her husband's killers - who have not yet been caught - telling them in her open letter: 'Jesus taught us to ""Love our enemies"" - not to kill them or seek revenge.' Mrs Smith is planning to return to Benghazi to visit the couple's friends and neighbors, who have rallied round and sent messages of support since the shooting. Before the couple left for Libya, her husband had made a video for . the Austin Stone Community Church. In it, he said he was worried about adapting to Libyan life but felt a desire to . spread a spiritual message. The teacher said: 'If there's any single . person in the entire universe that you can take a chance on, it's God.' Education: Ronnie Smith worked at Benghazi International School, where students and teachers paid tribute to him . The video clip, shown by CBS, . shows Ronnie and his wife Anita boarding the plane to begin their new . life. At one point, the teacher leans over in his seat to plant a kiss . on his wife's cheek. Although . he was aware of the dangers, particularly as a U.S. citizen, Mr Smith . drew strength from his faith and the difference that he could make in . his students' lives. He said: 'No matter what happens, I'm good. That gives me peace, and I'm OK with that.' The . chemistry teacher also served as a deacon at the Austin Stone Community . Church which is described on its website as a New Testament Church. Mr . Smith's commitment to his life in Benghazi and the people he met, was . reflected in the hundreds of messages posted on social media in the wake . of his death. The chemistry teacher described himself as 'Libya's best . friend' on his Twitter account. Mr . Smith's students tweeted emotional tributes to their chemistry teacher . with the tag #ThankYouSmith. Sara wrote: '#ThankYouSmith for being a great teacher and an amazing friend.' @umyeahidek . posted: '#ThankYouSmith for risking your life every single day to help . reach our full potential in life. I am sorry you had to go this way.' Devoted: Ronnie Smith tweeted this picture on November 15 of his wedding day with wife Anita with the message: '16 years with my besty' The . Libyan Youth movement wrote: 'Ronnie was living and teaching in . #Benghazi on his own accord, he told friends ""If I were to be killed, I . will die for Education."" #libya . Adel al Mansouri, . director of International School Benghazi, said: 'He was doing his morning exercise when gunmen just shot him. I don't . know why. He was so sweet with everyone.' The director added: 'He . loved being in Benghazi and he loved Libya and the kindness of its . people.' The . teacher was jogging in an area close to the U.S. Consulate when he was killed. The U.S. ambassador to Libya . Christopher . Stevens and three other Americans - Sean Smith, Tyron Woods . and Glen Doherty - were killed on September 11, 2012 . when Islamist militants assaulted the consulate in Benghazi. Benghazi has become a flashpoint for . violence in Libya with the city at the heart of the 2011 revolution . against leader Muammar Gaddafi. Libyan . special forces have been battling . militants from Ansar al-Sharia, the group that U.S. officials blame for . attacking the U.S. consulate in the eastern city in September . 2012. Two . years after a NATO-backed uprising ousted veteran leader Gaddafi, . Libya's armed forces are struggling to contain militias, former fighters . and Islamist militants who control parts of the vast oil-producing . country. Faith: Ronnie Smith went to Libya to help . My . husband and best friend Ronnie Smith loved the Libyan people. For more . than a year, Ronnie served as a chemistry teacher in a school in . Benghazi, and he would gladly have given more years to Libya if unknown . gunmen had not cut his life short on December 5, 2013. Ronnie . and I came to Libya because we saw the suffering of the Libyan people, . but we also saw your hope, and we wanted to partner with you to build a . better future. Libya was very different from what we had experienced . before, but we were excited to learn about Libyan culture. Ronnie grew . to love you and your way of life, as did I. Ronnie really was ""Libya’s . best friend"". Friends . and family from home were concerned about our safety, as were some of . you. We talked about this more times than I can count. But we stayed . because we believed the Libyan people were worth the risk. Even knowing . what I know now, I have no doubt that we would both make the same . decision all over again. Ronnie . loved you all so much, especially his students. He loved to joke with . you, tell stories about you, help you with your lives and challenge you . to be all that you could be.

Expensive tastes: Benefits cheat Johura Begum screamed as she was taken down to the cells . A benefits cheat, who claims she did not know her husband owned a £400,000-a-year restaurant, or that her parents owned the property she was claiming housing benefits for, was dragged screaming to jail. Johura Begum, 32, spent £130 a time at the hairdressers despite wearing a burka and splashed out on designer clothes and handbags, while claiming a car accident had made her unfit to work. She said her husband Mohammed Chowdhury was earning as little as £30 a week as a waiter, when in fact he owned the successful Spices Tandoori restaurant in Colchester. Begum was jailed for eight months after being found guilty of fiddling £82,000 and had to forcibly led to the cells by security officers at the Old Bailey. ‘Prison?’ she pleased. ‘I’ve got two children. Please let me speak to my lawyer.’ One of the officers told her: ‘You can speak to him in the cells,’ as she was pulled from the dock. The court heard Begum and her husband Mohammed Chowdhury, 33, began making fraudulent claims in 2007. Begum said she had twice been involved in car accidents when her husband was driving. ‘She claimed a medical condition had made her unfit for work,’ said prosecutor Pauline Thompson. ‘Eight days after that claim was successful, Chowdhury applied for housing benefit and council tax benefit.’ But the couple failed to mention was that her mother owned the property they were living in at Inworth Walk, Colchester, Essex. The fraud continued for five years, even when the couple moved in with her parents at Willis House, in Hale Street, Poplar and Begum claimed for £1,150 in rent. On the dole forms Begum would claim she had nothing in her bank account when she had taken out up to £800 on that very day. ‘There were extensive shopping expeditions including trips to the hairdresser which cost her £130,’ said Ms Thompson. Denial: Begum said she had no idea that her husband Mohammed . Chowdhury owned the successful Spices Tandoori restaurant in Colchester . ‘She had a penchant for visits to the high end shops in Canary Wharf. This was a lady who purchased her groceries in Waitrose. ‘She also spent £400 at Burberry and £200 at Reiss.’ During this time Chowdhury owned the Spices Restaurant in Butt Road, Colchester, but claimed he could only get around 16 hours waiting work a week for which he was paid between £30 and £40. Begum of Poplar admitted seven charges of fraud and fraud by false representation. After her arrest she has continued insist she had no idea her husband ran his own restaurant or that her parents owned a property in Ipswich. The court heard Begum, who has previous convictions for shoplifting, was born in Bangladesh but came to the UK when she was a child. Her father Abdul Mannan has lived here for 40 years but does not speak a word of English. Warrant: Mohammed Chowdhury was due to be sentenced with his wife but failed to turn up at court . Mannan was originally charged with his daughter but the case was dropped by the prosecution. Chowdhury admitted one count of fraud, and five counts of fraud by false representation. He was due to be sentenced with his wife but failed to turn up at court and a warrant is out for his arrest. Begum’s barrister Girish Thanki claimed Chowdhury was a drug addict and a gambler who had married his wife bigamously. He said Chowdhury would not let his wife go out to work - even though she was desperate to get a job. ‘She went along with this fraud. She was in genuine fear,’ Mr Thanki said. He claimed Chowdhury also forced to have an abortion when he did not want to have another child. ‘She accepts there was an element of extravagant spending by her. She was able to buy the fashion items,”Mr Thanki added. ‘She did this because the money was there. ‘She did not know that he was running a restaurant because his life was a complete mystery to her.’ ‘She was a dutiful wife. She knew what was going on but there was very little opportunity to do anything.’ He asked for a suspended sentence but Judge Richard Marks was unimpressed. ‘The amount that this fraud obtained was in the region of £82,000,’ the judge said. ‘The length of time this fraud spanned together with the sums concerned make it a fraud of considerable seriousness. ‘Benefits fraud of this type is unhappily prevalent and costs the taxpayer billions of pounds.’The judge told Begum: ‘It is apparent from the bank evidence that certainly on a number of occasions you enjoyed expensive shopping expeditions including a trip to the hairdresser for £130, shopping at Waitrose, spending £400 on Burberry and a spend of over £200 on Reiss. ‘You knew exactly what you were doing you played a full part on it and you benefited from it.’","Johura Begum spent £130 a time at the hairdressers despite wearing a burka .

Plans for secret courts to be voted on by MPs today will undermine centuries of open justice and erode Britain’s moral standing in the world, according to a hard-hitting new report. A paper by senior Tory MP Andrew Tyrie - a campaigner on human rights - and leading QC Anthony Peto, calls on the government to rewrite its plans to hold court cases covering national security behind closed doors. Cabinet Minister Ken Clarke has watered down the controversial Justice and Security Bill following a series of humiliating defeats in the House of Lords. A paper by Tory MP Andrew Tyrie (pictured) - a campaigner on human rights - and leading QC Anthony Peto, calls on the government to rewrite its plans to hold court cases covering national security behind closed doors . But ministers are still facing a rebellion despite attempts to buy off Liberal Democrat MPs opposed to secret justice. And today Mr Tyrie publishes a report for the Centre for Policy Studies think tank branding the plans ‘neither just nor secure’ and arguing that they need to be ‘substantially rewritten’. He said plans to hold civil court hearings on whether British spies colluded in torture will lead to a cover up of the dark side of the war on terror. ‘The Government must make major changes to the Justice and Security Bill or risk prejudicing both Britain’s system of open justice and our moral standing in the world,’ the report says. The Daily Mail has led criticism of plans to allow secret courts, under which civil cases would be conducted entirely in private. Ministers claim they need to hold some cases behind closed doors so that judges can hear evidence on intelligence matters. The Government has paid millions of pounds to terror suspects who accuse it of complicity in torture and rendition, after ministers said it was impossible to defend such claims without releasing secret material. But under the plans for ‘closed material proceedings’ defendants or claimants will not allowed to be present, know or challenge the case against them and must be represented by a security-cleared advocate, rather than their own lawyer. The new report says: ‘That Britain allowed itself to be dragged into complicity in extraordinary rendition - the kidnap and torture of individuals as a matter of policy - is a disgrace. 'That, nearly a decade later, the extent and limits of Britain’s involvement are still unknown is almost as shocking. Open: The Daily Mail has led criticism of Government plans to allow civil hearings to be conducted in private . ‘Far from bolstering that confidence, the Justice and Security Bill... would weaken it. 'The effect of the Government’s proposals would make it more difficult to establish the truth about Britain’s complicity in kidnap and torture. The Bill would provide a route neither more just nor more secure.’ The report calls for new rules which would mean summaries of the national security sensitive information be provided to the excluded party and his or her legal representatives. It demands a five year sunset clause, which would force Parliament to reconsider how the secret courts are operating in the next Parliament. The report warns that MPs must also stand firm to oppose the removal of the courts’ power to hear applications which seek the disclosure of information held by UK authorities, in cases deemed to be “sensitive”. This was the principle used by detainee Binyam Mohamed’s lawyers when he was contesting charges that could have resulted in the death penalty. ‘Removing it will make it harder to uncover official wrongdoing in matters such as extraordinary rendition,’ the report argues. And Mr Tyrie also argues that Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee be given far more powers to hold the security services to account. At present it reports to the Prime Minister and was widely derided for failing to get to grips with MI5 and MI6’s knowledge of rendition. He said: ‘The title of the Bill is classic doublespeak; it brings us neither more justice nor greater security. To agree only to the amendments suggested by the Lords is not going far enough, as the Lords simply did not have the time to put all their concerns over this Bill in the form of amendments.’ A government source said Mr Clarke had bowed to concerns raised by the Lords and by Parliament’s Joint Human Rights Committee (JCHR). The source said: ‘The Bill is being substantially rewritten to accommodate the Lib Dems and clauses have been rewritten to achieve what the JCHR wanted.’",Paper by senior Tory MP Andrew Tyrie calls on government to rewrite its plans .

Google's top lawyer has said the internet giant is 'concerned and outraged' at claims that the NSA has tapped into its private network. David Drummond's comments came as newly leaked documents from Edward Snowden allegedly showed a sketch detailing how the NSA accessed Google using a new program known as MUSCULAR. The sketch, published by the Washington Post, reportedly caused two Google engineers to 'explode into profanity' as it showed how to bypass security measures. Scroll down for video . Leaked: In a slide from an NSA presentation, a sketch shows where the 'Public Internet' meets the 'Google Cloud' user data - with a smiley face to celebrate getting around the secure links . A few months ago Mr Drummond had said 'the government does not have access to Google servers - not directly, or via a back door,' according to Business Insider. But, after the latest allegations, he released a statement that said: 'We are outraged at the lengths to which . the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private . fiber networks, and it underscores the need for urgent reform.' He said: 'We have long been concerned about the . possibility of this kind of snooping, which is why we have continued to . extend encryption across more and more Google services and links, . especially the links in the slide.' 'We do not provide any government, . including the U.S. government, with access to our systems,' he added. The NSA's director, General Keith Alexander, denied the agency had illegally accessed internet companies' servers. 'This is not NSA breaking into any databases. It would be illegal for us to do that ... But I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers. We go through a court order,' he told CNN. In a statement tweeted earlier in the day the NSA didn't deny the existence of MUSCULAR but insisted that it was not collecting 'vast quantities' of data on its citizens. Seized: The NSA has reportedly secretly broken into main communications links that connect Yahoo and Google data centers around the world. This photo shows a Google data center in Hamina, Finland . The NSA's principal tool to exploit . the data links is a project called MUSCULAR, operated jointly with the . agency's British counterpart, GCHQ. The program uses an unnamed . telecommunications provider giving secret access to a . cable for Google and Yahoo to pass unencrypted traffic between their . servers. 'NSA is a foreign intelligence agency. And we’re focused on discovering and developing intelligence about valid foreign intelligence targets only,' a NSA statement read, according to Business Insider. The Washington Post had reported that the NSA sent millions of records from Yahoo and Google internal networks to data warehouses at the . agency's Fort Meade, Maryland headquarters,every day. The newspaper cited documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, which included a . slide from an agency presentation . entitled 'Google Cloud Exploitation'. The slide featured a sketch showing where . the 'Public Internet' meets the internal 'Google Cloud' of user data. Denial: NSA director General Keith Alexander says the agency has not illegally accessed servers . On . the sketch, a note added that encryption was 'added and remove here!' and . the artist jotted a smiley face - in what the Post called a 'cheeky . celebration of victory over Google security'. 'Two engineers with close ties to Google exploded in profanity when they saw the drawing,' the Post reported. In the 30 days after January 9, field collectors were said to have processed and sent back more than 180 million new records - ranging . from 'metadata', which would indicate who sent or received emails and . when, to content such as text, audio and video. Both companies said they had not given the NSA permission to do so and were not aware of the activity. The Post said NSA and GCHQ were copying entire data flows across fiber-optic cables that carry information between the data centers of the Silicon Valley giants. General Alexander said he NSA was not authorized to access data centers and had to go through a court process to obtain it. The report comes despite the companies saying their servers are closely guarded and strictly audited. According to Google, buildings housing its servers are guarded around-the-clock and secured with heat-sensitive cameras and biometric verification. In a statement to the Post, Google . said it was 'troubled by allegations of the government intercepting . traffic between our data centers, and we are not aware of this . activity'. At Yahoo a . spokesman added: 'We have strict controls in place to protect the . security of our data centers, and we have not given access to our data . centers to the NSA or to any other government agency.' White House officials and the Office of . the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the NSA, declined . to comment, the Post said. Revelations: The information was obtained by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden . The . NSA already collects data from Google, Yahoo and other technology . companies under another program known as PRISM - details of which were . revealed by Snowden earlier this year. The program legally compels the companies to provide the agency with information that matches court-approved search terms. The collection of data by MUSCULAR would be illegal in the U.S, but the operations take place overseas, where the NSA can presume anyone using a foreign data link is a foreigner, the Post said.","In 30 day the NSA is said to have gleaned 180 million records including text, audio and video - and who sent it to whom and when they sent it .

But 6,000 British parents each year are dealt the double blow of being told their child is not only very ill, but that doctors are limited in what they can do to help because they do not know what the problem is. This is the plight of families affected by SWAN or Syndrome Without A Name. Six-year-old Jonah Norris is one of the 40 per cent of disabled children in the UK who suffer with what doctors have termed as Syndrome Without a Name (SWAN) SWAN is not a condition or a diagnosis and it does not refer to one specific syndrome or condition. It is used as an umbrella term to describe all those conditions that medical experts do not understand. It is though that around 40 per cent of disabled children in the UK suffer with SWAN. Many SWAN children remain undiagnosed because it is highly likely that they have a very rare syndrome or condition. At six years old, Jonah Norris has only . just reached the milestone of being able to sit up unsupported. He still cannot . walk, talk or feed himself. Yet doctors are entirely unable to explain what is causing his assortment of seemingly unrelated symptoms. He has undergone a barrage of tests and not one has suggested that there is anything wrong with him. However, he is profoundly disabled, unable to speak or stand, and has to be fed through a tube directly into his stomach. For the first few months of Jonah’s life his parents Hayley, 39, and her husband, Ben, believed their son had nothing more than clubfoot. However, at nine months old, a health visitor noticed that he was not able to sit up unsupported so referred him to a specialist for tests. He was seen by physiotherapists and underwent a range of genetic tests but all of them came back normal. Mrs Norris said: ‘As soon as we took him to the hospital they realised there was something severely wrong. ‘However, they never had any idea what was wrong with him. Jonah's mother Hayley says that despite his serious disabilities he brings a huge amount of joy to the family and that he is full of energy and always laughing . ‘Nobody ever even suggested what it could be. All we know is that it is probably something genetic.’ She added: ‘We have now run out of things to test for.’ Jonah would not eat any solids until he was over a year old, he is dependent upon a wheelchair, and he is totally disinterested in food. Mrs Norris said: ‘His development is very delayed – he is behind his one-year-old sister. ‘No one knows why he is not interested in food but he would not survive without his tube because he will not eat – at one point he went three years without putting on any weight.’ Mrs Norris, who is Jonah’s full-time carer, explained what it is like to have a child with SWAN. SWAN - Syndrome Without a Name - is the term used to describe disabled children who are thought to have a genetic syndrome that doctors are unable to identify. About 50 per cent of children with learning disabilities, and 60 per cent of children with multiple congenital problems, do not have a definitive diagnosis. The parents of SWAN children often find their situation very isolating as no one is able to answer questions about their child's future. She said: ‘When you first find out your child is disabled you cling to the idea that it will be diagnosed – I pushed for lots of tests because I was desperate to know what was wrong, but the tests always came back normal. ‘Some people worry that a diagnosis will be worse than not having one, but I think I would rather know because the fear of the unknown is worse than knowing what is going to happen. ‘At least if I knew what the future holds for him I could prepare myself, but we are always having to second guess with him.’ She added: ‘It can be quite frustrating because we do not know why things are happening. ‘If we had a diagnosis we would have an idea of the eventual outcome – I would like to know what the future holds, to have a label.’ Mrs Norris and her husband, an IT specialist at the BBC, also have an eight-year-old son, Reuben, and a 21-month-old daughter, Martha. They have a child minder who helps them care for Jonah so that they can dedicate time to their other children. Mrs Norris said: ‘I struggled a lot at the beginning, having to come to terms with having a disabled son. But my husband is fantastic – he helps out with the morning and evening routine. ‘I think that having Jonah as a brother will make my other children much more caring adults. ‘My oldest son just sees Jonah as a brother – it is as simple as that, he does not see him as disabled. ‘Jonah brings a huge amount of joy to the family – he is a very happy child, he has a lot of energy and he is always laughing. ‘He doesn’t let his disability get in the way of having fun. He is an absolute delight and he is always making people laugh.’ Mrs Norris says that she has been given a huge amount of support by the charity SWAN UK which provides support to families with SWAN children. She said: ‘SWAN UK is just amazing – so many people are in the same position as us and to be able to talk to them is invaluable. You need that support to know that you are not on your own.’ Anne Harris, Director of Care Services for Rainbow Trust, a charity which also provides support to the families of children with life limiting disabilities and illnesses, including SWAN, said: ‘Having a sick child can be a very isolating experience and when your child does not have a definite diagnosis, that sense of isolation can be magnified greatly. ‘There may not be other parents or families with whom you can identify, or share experiences, and other sources of support such as disease specific groups may not be available to you. ‘There are an increasing number of children living with complex health needs, many of whom may not have a “name” for their condition and who may have an increased need for support which is where organisations like Rainbow Trust Children’s Charity, which support families with or without diagnosis, are invaluable.’ For more information about SWAN visit SWAN UK’s website http://www.undiagnosed.org.uk/ .

The bizarre six-sided storm churning Saturn’s north pole has been captured in unprecedented  detail. The hexagon is a wavy jet stream of 200 mph winds and spans 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across - more than twice the diameter of Earth. Scientists believe there is no weather feature like this anywhere else in the solar system. Scroll down for video and animations... The animation above shows a view from directly over Saturn's north pole, keeping up with the rotation of the planet so that all the motion seen on the screen is the motion of the storms inside the hexagon. The footage captured by the Cassini spacecraft is the first of its kind, using colour filters, to show a complete view of the top of Saturn. ‘A hurricane on Earth typically lasts a week, but this has been here for decades - and who knows - maybe centuries,’ said Andrew Ingersoll, at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. This animation above shows a view from directly over the north pole, keeping up with the rotation of the planet so that all the motion seen on the screen is the motion of the storms inside the hexagon. This older, colour composite image - showing false shades - has been created from raw images taken by Cassini from a distance of 379,268 miles away . The mysterious six-sided hexagon on Saturn’s North Pole has long captivated astronomers is thought to be is nearly 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers). The hexagon is made of a band of . upper-atmospheric winds which creates its six-sided shape. A polar . cyclone can be seen at its centre. First seen by Voyagers 1 and 2 over 30 years ago the hexagon it thought to be fixed with Saturn’s rotation. In April, the Cassini spacecraft . provided scientists with the first close-up, visible-light views of a . behemoth hurricane swirling within the hexagon. Thin, . bright clouds at the outer edge of the hurricane were estimated to be . travelling at around 330 mph (150 metres per second). Weather patterns on Earth are interrupted when they encounter friction from land forms. Scientists suspect the stability of the . hexagon has something to do with the lack of solid land forms on Saturn, . which is essentially a giant ball of gas. Better views of the hexagon are available now because the sun began to illuminate its interior in late 2012. Cassini captured images of the hexagon over a 10-hour time span with high-resolution cameras, giving scientists a good look at the motion of cloud structures within. Scientists saw the storm around the pole, as well as small vortices rotating in the opposite direction of the hexagon. Some of the vortices are swept along with the jet stream as if on a racetrack. The largest of these vortices spans about 2,200 miles (3,500 km), or about twice the size of the largest hurricane recorded on Earth. The footage captured by the Cassini spacecraft is the first of its kind, using colour filters, to show a complete view of the top of Saturn . Scientists analysed these images in false colour, a rendering method that made it easier to distinguish differences among the types of particles suspended in the atmosphere inside and outside the hexagon. ‘Inside the hexagon, there are fewer large haze particles and a concentration of small haze particles, while outside the hexagon, the opposite is true,’ said Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at Hampton University in Virginia. ‘The hexagonal jet stream is acting like a barrier, which results in something like Earth's Antarctic ozone hole.’ The Antarctic ozone hole forms within a region enclosed by a jet stream with similarities to the hexagon.

Tiny apartments are cropping up in major cities around the country to meet the demand of people who are short on cash but determined to live in areas with otherwise pricey rents. Micros, also known as 'hostel-style' apartments, usually offer less than 200 square feet including private bathrooms, and they typically come furnished, sometimes with built-in beds and other amenities to save space. Most feature a group kitchen that may be shared among eight units, although units in Aaron McConnell's complex are equipped with microwave ovens and small refrigerators. 'Boarding houses on steroids': Jon-Christian Stubblefield, left, relaxes inside of his 200-square-foot apartment at the Element 10 Mini-Suites in Seattle, right . 'I like living in a community,' said McConnell, 28, who pays $737 a month for his apartment in Seattle. 'It's kind of fun, very social.' Micros also include Internet connections and utilities in the price of the rent. There are no elevators. Few come with parking, but McConnell has a street parking pass for his neighborhood that is close to Seattle University and several of the city's major hospitals. What micro apartments lack in space they often make up for in proximity to prime locations. McConnell's is situated near Seattle's lively Pike-Pine Corridor, an area rich in restaurants, bars and shops. In Seattle, rents for micro apartments range from about $500 to $1,000, while a one-bedroom apartment rental in Seattle averaged $1,223 this spring, according to Mike Scott of Dupre + Scott Apartment Advisors Inc. Not everyone is in favor of the trend. Residents of some conventional homes and apartments near McConnell's worry that micro sprawl could overcrowd their neighborhood infrastructure, adding to traffic congestion and making already scarce parking even harder to find. Tight squeeze: Seungchul You sits in his one-room apartment at Element 10 in Seattle . 'These are like boarding houses on steroids,' said Carl Winter, founder of the group Reasonable Density Seattle and a resident of the neighborhood. 'I'm living the nightmare.' Micro developments have drawn criticism for not facing the same level of design and environmental review that a newly constructed conventional apartment undergoes because a single-dwelling is defined as a unit that includes its own kitchen. 'We did a calculation and there are 19 micro apartments going in on 12 sites well within 1 square mile' in his neighborhood, Winter said. 'Our big issue is they are not being subjected to the same regulatory process as everyone else.' Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn is on record in support of micro apartments, as is City Council member Richard Conlin. 'The private market is building affordable housing for people who want it,' Conlin said. 'Fundamentally, this is a good thing.' Young people starting out, service workers and retirees on limited incomes all need affordable housing, Conlin and other supporters said. Pressed for space: Seungchul You stands in his one-room apartment at Element 10 in Seattle . Forty-one micro housing projects have come through the Seattle Department of Planning and Development since 2006, spokeswoman Cyndi Wilder said. Of those, 28 received permits and 13 are under examination. The planning department is aware of the debate over the review process for micro apartment buildings, she said, and the Seattle City Council ""is going through an information-gathering process.' In San Francisco, some see the potential for micro apartments to become the domain of high-paid, high-tech suburbanites who keep them for the occasional night in the city, a kind of new-age pied-a-terre, as opposed to serving as real homes for working-class residents. 'If they are going to be used for high-tech workers, they will end up having a gentrification effect and push rents up,' said Ted Gullicksen, director of the San Francisco Tenants Union. Otherwise, his organization has no objections, he said. Gullicksen described micro apartments as ideal for college students, who have trouble finding an affordable place to live in the city. 'If they ended up being used for student housing, that would be a good thing,' he said. New York City is experimenting with micro apartments, with the backing of Mayor Mike Bloomberg. Last year, Bloomberg, along with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner Mathew M Wambua, launched the adAPT NYC Competition, a pilot program to develop a rental building composed of micro-units, according to Bloomberg's website. Mirco living: Jon-Christian Stubblefield checks his mail outside of his Mini-Suite apartment building in Seattle . The winner of the competition proposed 55 units ranging from 250 to 370 square feet, made of prefab modules. The building is scheduled for completion in Manhattan by September 2015, and will include a rooftop garden, lounges, a deck, laundry, bike storage, a cafe and fitness room. In Boston, Mayor Thomas Menino is also a supporter of the tiny apartments, saying the city must create more housing for workers and seniors, and that micro apartments fit the bill. Matthew Gardner, a Seattle land use economist and chairman of the Board of Trustees for the Washington Center for Real Estate Research, said he is not surprised by the rush to build micro apartments in the past year or so, at least in his city. The economy is doing better and rents are rising, he said. 'Land is at a premium here,' he said. 'So where do (local) service workers live? They want to be close to where they work but can't afford the current price of apartments, which have gone up dramatically in last few years. The introduction of this hostel-type product could meet a lot of unsatisfied demand.' Living small: The Strada aPodment building houses low cost micro apartments in Seattle . Jim Potter, chairman of Kauri Investments, said the micros he builds, including the Emerald 10 complex where McConnell lives, provide a housing option for a group of hard-working people and retirees largely overlooked by most developers. 'Nobody else is producing something at this moderately priced range,' he said. 'You get a brand new building with a new bathroom. You get Internet access and it's fully furnished. In general, our buildings are on major bus lines and/or light rail.' Potter has worked with other developers to build six micro apartment complexes in Seattle, with several more planned. He also is working on projects in Portland, Oregon; San Francisco and in New Jersey. 'This product has legs on it,' Potter said. 'It is a national phenomenon and Seattle is ahead of the pack.' The average stay in Potter's micro apartments is one year, and the residents' average age is about 33, he said. Most have incomes below $35,000 a year and do not own a car. As for McConnell, he plans to stay in his micro apartment until January, when he's getting married. 'Then I'll see where life takes us,' he said.","More people short on cash living in less than 200 square feet .

With less than two weeks until George Zimmerman goes on trial in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, has defense fund has been revealed to be almost depleted. Zimmerman's attorneys posted on their website on Wednesday that the fund has less than $5,000 left. Back in January the fund had almost $315,000. The attorneys say they calculate that Zimmerman needs another $120,000 to put on a good defense or even another $75,000 to give him a fighting chance. Scroll down for video . George Zimmerman's lead counsel Mark O'Mara, left, has revealed that the defense fund for his client is down to $5,000 from $314,099 at the start of the year . Attorneys Mark O'Mara and Don West say they haven't been paid a cent and many interns are working on the case without pay. They say they will need the money in the coming weeks to pay experts and for transcripts of depositions. It hasn't been a good week for Zimmerman's defense team. A judge ruled on Tuesday that they won't be able to mention Trayvon Martin's drug use, suspension from school and past fighting during opening statements in the trial. Circuit Judge Debra Nelson also refused to allow jurors to travel to the shooting scene during trial, and rejected a defense request to delay the trial set to begin June 10. The judge called the request to let jurors see the crime scene 'a logistical nightmare.' George Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder in the 17-year-old's killing and has pleaded not guilty, saying he acted in self-defense. He did not attend Tuesday's hearing. Despite attempts by his legal team to have the date postponed, Zimmerman's trail for the second-degree murder of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, right, will begin June 10 . Holding firm: Circuit Judge Debra Nelson refused to allow jurors to travel to the shooting scene during trial, and rejected a defense request to delay the trial set to begin June 10 . The judge also ruled that some of the Martin's texts and other social media statements won't be allowed in opening statements, though some of the teen's personal history could be allowed later with a ruling from the judge depending on how the case progresses. Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, had argued that text messages . sent by the 17-year-old - in which he describes being 'angry' following . a fight with another teen on the night he was fatally shot by Zimmerman - . should be heard by a potential jury because it's 'relevant to [Martin's] . emotional state,' and would strengthen the defense's claim that Martin . was the aggressor in the struggle that ultimately took his life. 'He got mo hits cause in da 1st round,' Martin says in a November 2011 . text message, apparently in reference to a fight he'd been in prior to his run-in with Zimmerman. 'He had me on da ground nd I . couldnâ€™t do ntn.' Defense: Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara, left, has told the judge that Martin's marijuana use and past fighting was central to the argument that Zimmerman used self-defense when he confronted Martin last year . With the photos and text messages, . Zimmerman's attorneys hope to show that Martin wasn't the 'angel' he's . been made out to be by his family, attorneys, and the media, but rather . an experienced fighter who used drugs. O'Mara also told the judge that Martin's marijuana use and past fighting was central to the argument that Zimmerman used self-defense when he confronted Martin last year at a gated community in Sanford, Florida. 'We have a lot of evidence that marijuana use had something to do with the event,' O'Mara said. 'It could have affected his behavior.' An attorney for Martin's family, Benjamin Crump, said the teen's parents were pleased with the judge's rulings. 'Trayvon Martin is not on trial,' Crump said. Zimmerman . himself is no 'angel,' critics say, and the evidence his attorneys are . hoping to have admitted could be an attempt to keep prosecutors from . introducing some less-than-flattering details about his past, including . an ex-fiance who filed an injunction order against Zimmerman following . an altercation, and some disparaging comments about Mexicans found on . Zimmerman's MySpace page. 'No angel': attorneys for alleged murderer George Zimmerman were denied a request for photos of Trayvon Martin smoking marijuana to be included as evidence in Zimmerman's murder trial . The judge ruled against a defense request that the pool of jury candidates be sequestered during jury selection. She said jurors will be referred to by their jury numbers and prohibited their faces from being photographed. Nelson denied a prosecution request for a gag order that would prohibit attorneys from talking about the case. O'Mara said he is concerned potential jurors could be affected by publicity the case is receiving. The . defense attorney had asked to push back the trial date because he said . prosecutors had delayed turning over evidence as required. O'Mara is seeking sanctions against prosecutors, but a hearing on those sanctions was delayed until next week. Self-defense: George Zimmerman claims that Trayvon Martin punched him repeatedly before he fatally shot him in February 2012 . Before the judge decided to postpone the hearing on sanctions, a former prosecutor who used to work in the same office as the attorneys prosecuting Zimmerman testified he had told O'Mara about photos and text messages from Martin's cell phone that hadn't yet been turned over to the defense.

Frances and Andrew Johnson, both in the Marines, are ready for their deployment shortly after the New Year, but they are not sure their son Noah is. They are one of 681 couples in the Marine Corps that have been deployed at the same time since 2011, according to CNN, they will be overseas for as long as 12 months. Gone for a year: Frances (left) and Andrew (right) Johnson are being deployed to Afghanistan at the same time - leaving toddler son Noah behind for a year . The couple, from San Diego, shared their struggle to prep their son for their deployment with the cable network. ‘Mommy and Daddy are going to go to work for a while ... but we always come back for you,’ Ms Johnson has been telling him. ‘We always come back for you.’ When they parted at the airport recently, the young boy asked if he could go to work with her. ‘I started crying and told him that I wish he could come to work with me, but that I would come back to him like I always do as soon as I could,’ she said. Military family: The couple is both in the Marines, it will be Ms Johnson's first deployment . She then smothered Noah in hugs and kisses before walking away ‘as fast as she could.’ It did not have to be this way, they were not ordered to go to Afghanistan together, but Frances Johnson volunteered since she had not yet deployed during the six years she has been enlisted. Her husband’s enlistment was scheduled to end soon, but he was offered a deployment that would come with a promotion. ‘I said this is kind of a sign. 'Hey, it's not time for you to go just yet. You still have a little more work in the Marine Corps,’ she recalled telling him. So off they go to Afghanistan together while her parents in Colorado watch after Noah, they will not even get to spend Christmas together as a family. Frances Johnson says she has received a good deal of backlash from people who learn of their decision. Already separated: The couple had to leave their son with her parents before Christmas in order to prepare for the deployment . ‘Sometimes, people who find out that both of us are deploying, they kind of say backhanded comments like, 'Wow, you guys are so brave for leaving your son. I could never do that,’ she recalled. 'You know, I try to be so centered around my kids.' And it's like, 'OK, well, me, too, but this is my job,’ she said. She told the network that, despite the negative reactions, her husband has supported her every step of the way. ‘It hurts, but my husband is very, very good about focusing on the positives, because I am very good at focusing on the negatives.’ All both parents are doing, she says, are focusing on when they come home. ‘I keep thinking about how I'll try to be as polite as possible, but I'll probably be running people over just to get to him.’","Frances and Andrew Johnson, both in the Marines, are being deployed to Afghanistan shortly after the New Year .

The prestigious American Ballet Theatre’s first black soloist in twenty years will take the stage this week, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg in the unlikely, groundbreaking life of ballerina Misty Copeland. The 30-year-old beauty hits the stage in 'Le Corsaire' at the Metropolitan Opera House Tuesday, but her star turn is just one of a string of firsts and a fascinating life story she brings along with her. For starters, Copeland, a native of San Pedro, California, grew up in extreme poverty. She didn’t even know what ballet was when she was spotted by an instructor at her local Boys and Girls Club at 13. Scroll down for video . Trailblazer: Dancer Misty Copeland will become the first black soloist to perform at the prestigious American Ballet Theatre in 20 years starting Tuesday . Which brings up another unlikely fact in Copeland’s life—she didn’t even begin training in ballet until her early teen years. ‘I had no introduction to the arts in any way definitely not the fine arts,’ Copeland told the New York Post of her childhood, part of which was spent living out of a motel room with her mother. ‘Survival was our Number 1 priority, not extracurriculars, or a career,’ she said. ‘These were not things we thought about.’ She was destined, however, to think a lot about those things. In fact, she would soon be thinking of nothing but. Formerly known as: Copeland dances with Prince at Madison Square Garden in 2010 as part of the musician's tour. The pop legend reportedly asked her personally to appear with him . Racy: Copeland danced atop Prince's piano as part of one of his signature sexy performances, this one in his 2010-2011 'Welcome 2 America' tour . A ballet instructor named Cynthia Bradley spotted Copeland’s potential and told her she was ‘You are the most gifted dancer I’ve ever seen, and this could be a path to have a career.’ And that’s what it became. But at 13, Copeland was at a major disadvantage. Whereas most ballerinas start at the age of 5, with money and eager parents backing them. Copeland was not so lucky. In just a few years, the young phenom had to cram in nearly two decades worth of training. That is, if she wanted to compete among the best. In addition to her age and the color of her skin, Copeland stood apart from her peers as she quickly rose in the ranks of the world’s best dancers because of her physique. Where most ballerinas are extremely slim, Copeland is curvaceous. Almost lost it: The stunning dancer will star in 'Le Corsaire' just 8 months after undergoing surgery to correct a potentially career-ending bone fracture . Copeland’s rise to prominence, at least at first, also caused some problems with her family. Cynthia Bradley invited Copeland to live with her in order to allow her maintain the kind of focus most ballerinas-in-training have, away from her impoverished home life. But after a few years of this, life away from her daughter took a toll on Copeland’s mother and a bitter battle ensued for custody of the then 15-year-old. Copeland’s mother eventually won out. ‘My mom said, “I want you to be a normal child, living at home, going to school,”’ Copeland recalled. Nonetheless, Copeland's life was destined not to be normal. She continued to pursue her ballet dreams, winning awards, accolades, her own 2013 calendar, and even the adoration of pop legend Prince. Model citizen: Misty Copeland's unlikely rise to ballet stardom has recently won her something usually reserved for swimsuit models: her own wall calendar . In 2010, after The Artist personally pursued her, Copeland agreed to dance as part of Prince's string of New York City performances. Copeland gushed about the experience to the Post: . 'The energy I felt at Madison Square Garden was like nothing I've ever experienced. I felt such a connection with the audience because you can hear their feedback, which doesn't happen during classical ballet performances.' She says they've stayed in touch since and Prince even attends her performances at the American Ballet Theatre, where she gets him box seats. And perhaps he'll be there this Tuesday, when Copeland breaks boundaries with her lead role in ‘Le Corsaire.’ This, just a few months after a severe fracture and the subsequent surgery to correct nearly ended her extraordinary career. Leader: As her star shines in the ballet world, Copeland, a who was raised in poverty in San Pedro, California, wants to show African American youth they, too, can succeed in ballet . Now, in the midst of her great success, Copeland wants to position herself as a role model for dancers of color. ‘People say, “It’s 2013, you live in New York City, you’re [being] dramatic,” but they don’t understand the way the ballet world works,” she told the Post. ‘We’re completely behind the way the world has evolved. Ballet is just kind of staid.’ And she wants to help change that. ‘For young African- Americans to feel that they have a chance to see a brown face on the stage, that ballet isn’t this white world that’s untouchable to them,’ she said. ‘I think having that visual does so much. I think it’s so important for them to see me and to hear me.’ Copeland's turn in the comedic ballet 'Le Corsair' runs June 4-8 at New York City's Metropolitan Opera House.

Anyone planning on moving to New York City or San Francisco may want to consult their bank account before they hire a real estate agent, because the two cities are almost exclusively for the rich, according to recently released data from the U.S. Census Bureau. New York and San Francisco have always been pricey places to live, but the new data shows that the once economically diverse municipalities are now dominated by the wealthy more than ever before. To illustrate the widening gap between the rich and poor in cities like San Francisco and New York, the Census Bureau has created map images that show the difference of income in respective cities from 1990 and 2012. Rich: The census map indicates that more of Manhattan is inhabited by people who make more than $75,000 a year than in 1990 . City by the Bay: the vast majority of neighborhoods in San Francisco are home to people making more than $75,000 per year . The images show a clear shift in the economic demographics of several neighborhoods in both New York and San Francisco. The darkest red sections of the maps denote areas with a median household income of $75,000 per year or more. The lightest white areas on the map show areas with a median household income of $35,000 a year or less. The other colors indicate a range of median incomes between $35,000 and $75,000 per year. Motor City: The median household income in Detroit has significantly dropped since 1990 in many areas . Windy City: Like Detroit, Chicago also has seen a decline in median income in many areas . Downtown Las Vegas appears to have run out of luck, while outlying areas have seen an increase in median income . In both cases, many areas that were once lighter shades of orange or tan - areas with median incomes less than $75,000 - are now dark red, indicating that wealthier people and families are moving in. The average incomes of New York state and California are $57,683 and $61,400 per year, respectively. Economic diversity in other cities - like Detroit and Chicago - seem to have shifted in the opposite direction, with more of the city now having a median income of less than $35,000 than in 1990.","Maps show the once economically diverse municipalities are now dominated by the wealthy .

Composer Andrew Lloyd-Webber warned of the Apollo Theatre's 'shocking' condition 10 years ago, calling for the Grade II listed building to be torn down. Investigations are today continuing into why around 10 square metres of plaster plummeted on to the stalls below, injuring 80 members of the audience on Thursday. The owner of the West End venue claimed last year that he theatre had 'suffered years of benign neglect'. Scroll down for videos . Composer and musical theatre impresario Andrew Lloyd-Webber, pictured on stage at the Apollo Theatre in 2002, said the playhouse was in a 'shocking' condition 10 years ago when he owned the theatre . The owner of the Apollo Theatre, in Shaftsbury Avenue, said last year that the building had 'suffered from years of benign neglect' The seats were left covered in planks of wood and debris after the ceiling collapsed on to the audience during Thursday's performance of The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night Time . David Porter and his wife Valerie were injured as they watched the performance on Thursday . Speaking to the Times in 2000, the then owner of the playhouse, which overlooks London's Shaftesbury Avenue, Mr Lloyd-Webber said a state-of-the-art new theatre should be built in its place. 'The Apollo in particular is a shocking place,' said Lord Lloyd-Webber, who sold it to Nimax in 2005. 'I suggested that both it and the Lyric should be knocked down and replaced by top-quality modern theatres.' One of the lines of inquiry being considered is that excess water during a torrential downpour may have caused the collapse, after forecasters confirmed there was an abnormally high concentration of rain, hail and lightning in London on Thursday. Nica Burns, co-owner and chief executive of Nimax Theatres, which runs the the building in Shaftesbury Avenue, said in an interview last year that it had a budget of just Â£2.45 million to restore its five West End playhouses. Support and thanks: Simon Stephens, the show playwright, wrote on Twitter: 'Thank you for your messages on this sad and strange night' Paramedics treat those who were wounded after around 10 square metres of plaster fell into the stalls . That was funded by a Â£1 restoration levy on tickets at the theatres, which the company said was spent entirely on upkeep and maintenance work once VAT was paid. Speaking to Theatres Magazine, Ms Burns said: 'Before we could start on the improvements, we had to address the damp. Water attacks the building from above and below.' The restoration work carried out included new Â£120,000 customer toilets and a makeover for four carved stone muses on the rooftop, she told the magazine. Musical theatre impresario Lord Lloyd-Webber complained that his plans for black-box auditorium inside the existing plasterwork had been opposed by English Heritage. When it listed the building in 1972, the public body cited the Apollo's 'richly ornamental shallow domed ceiling on pendentives' as one of its stand-out features. London Fire Brigade said eight fire engines had been sent to the scene. Around 700 people were thought to be in the theatre when the collapse occured . Fire crews climbed on top of the building as part of the investigation into what went wrong . More than 700 people were inside the Apollo - which was 45 minutes into the National Theatre's performance of The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-time - when members of the audience started screaming as it appeared parts of the ceiling caved in. Some of the injured were taken to hospital on board London buses as the emergency services dealt with the incident in the heart of the capital. Most were discharged shortly afterwards, having been mainly treated for cuts and bruises. Although performances at the Apollo have been cancelled until January 4, London mayor Boris Johnson said the West End was 'open for business'. Mr Johnson also praised the response from emergency services as 'exemplary', adding: 'Westminster City Council and the Society of London Theatre have assured me that all safety checks for the West End's historic theatres are up to date but, as a precaution, further checks have already started and will continue throughout the day.' A Scotland Yard spokesman said criminal involvement has been ruled out and the investigation into what happened would be handled by the council. Nicola Aiken, the council's cabinet member for community protection, said the theatre's health and safety checks were 'up to date'. 'Each historic theatre is unique and we have no reason to believe this is other than an isolated incident,' she said. 'We have confirmed today with the Society of London Theatre that all theatres' safety checks are up to date; however, as a precaution, all historic theatres are carrying out further safety checks today.'","Lord Lloyd-Webber called for the playhouse to be replaced with new theatre .

New research has revealed the true disparity in the real cost of studying at some of the UK’s top universities. The study, based on the 24-strong elite Russell Group of universities has shown that Cambridge and Bristol have beaten London into third place as the UK’s most expensive student cities based on the cost of renting a bedroom. Cambridge University is the most expensive university town costing around £97.25 in rent a week . Cambridge, home of the second most academically ranked university after Oxford, is the most expensive with a bedroom in a privately rented home costing on average £97.25 per week – more than £20 higher than the national average of £75.25. However, the university says most of its students rent from colleges and pay the £97.25 figure for only 30 weeks of term. Compared to Liverpool, rated 29th in the academic rankings, where a room rental costs £54.25 per week, people living in Cambridge are paying 79 per cent higher rents which amounts to £2,236 extra spent over the course of a year. The price of an education: Graph showing the cost of rent in the UK's university towns . Durham, placed fifth in the academic . rankings table, appears to offer the best value for money by offering . the highest ranking for lowest rental costs. The weekly cost of privately renting a room in the northern city averages £62. The average cost of a pint around the UK . Within London, the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) is slightly cheaper in terms of tuition costs, falling £500 per year lower than most of the Russell Group universities, who charge £9,000 for a Bachelor of Arts course. But this saving is more than swallowed up by the £2,236 more it costs to rent in the capital. Unsurprisingly, the most expensive student pint can be found at London’s universities, where at an average of £3.60 for a lager, the student loan has further to stretch compared to students of Cardiff University, who pay £1.35 less for their city centre pint. According to haart, parents are buying properties in the best value university towns for their children to live which can then be rented out when they leave. Paul Smith, CEO of haart estate agent which carried out the research, said: 'Many canny parents are taking advantage of the strong rental markets by buying a home where their children are studying and letting the property to their offspring and their friends. 'This pays for a ‘discounted’ rent for their child and offers a long-term investment for them. 'For those students looking to save money on their rental expenses and their social life, our tip is to study in Leeds, where average rent is £58.50 and the beer averages £2.45 a pint, £1.15 less than London and 30p less than Glasgow.'

Police commissioners, free schools and winter fuel cash for rich pensioners could be scrapped by a Labour government, Ed Balls revealed today. In a major speech setting out where the axe would fall after the next election, the shadow chancellor admitted for the first time that his party would have to continue cutting Whitehall budgets after 2015. Mr Balls also suggested scrapping whole government departments and agencies, as he warned the Labour party it had to get used to the idea that there would be no money. Cuts: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls warned the Labour party that it could not expect increasing public spending after the 2015 election . The Labour party is to launch a major drive this week to address real fears among voters that Mr Balls, and leader Ed Miliband, cannot be trusted with the economy. Next month Chancellor George Osborne will set out the coalition's spending plans for 2015-16, the financial year after the general election. Mr Balls signalled that Labour would take the coalition's 2015-16 spending review as a ""'starting point' with money 'switched' to Labour's priorities. He suggested that Labour would ditch plans by Education Secretary Michael Gove to build more free schools, abolish the police commissioners which were elected for the first time last year and scrap the winter fuel allowance for wealthy pensioners. Mr Balls said the party had to ask 'important' questions when drawing up its manifesto. 'With primary school places in short supply in many parts of the country, and parents struggling to get their children into a local school, can it really be a priority to open more free schools in 2015 and 2016 in areas with excess secondary school places? 'When we are losing thousands of police officers and police staff, how have we ended up spending more on police commissioners than the old police authorities, with more elections currently timetabled for 2016? 'With family budgets under such pressure and living standards falling, surely it makes sense to introduce a mansion tax on properties worth over £2m to pay for a lower 10p starting rate of tax? 'And when our NHS and social care system is under such pressure, can it really remain a priority to pay the Winter Fuel Allowance - a vital support for middle and low income pensioners - to the richest 5 per cent of pensioners, those with incomes high enough to pay the higher or top rates of tax?' Tough: Mr Balls' speech at Reuters in London today is seen as an attempt to persuade voters to trust Labour with the economy again . More than 600,000 better-off pensioners would lose their winter fuel payments the plan. In a speech at the City headquarters of news agency Reuters, Mr Balls said the next Labour government would need to show 'iron discipline' and a 'relentless focus'. His revelation that Labour would take away cold weather payments is a rare declaration of a policy which would follow an election victory. The benefit is worth between £200 and £300 a year for richer OAPs who pay higher and top rate income tax – about one in 20. The plans would only raise about £105million a year, less than half of 1 per cent of the welfare budget. But the move will put David Cameron in an awkward position since the Prime Minister has promised not to cut  pensioner benefits. Polls show the public wants to see wealthy pensioners lose their perks while the Liberal Democrats have repeatedly called for winter fuel allowance to be cut or taxed. Mr Balls says that richer pensioners should shoulder their share of the cuts. But Peter Hain, a former Labour Cabinet minister, said the move was a slippery slope which will save peanuts' and raise questions about meanstesting other benefits including  TV licences, bus passes and senior rail cards. Mr Hain wrote in an article for Huffington Post: 'If middle Britain ceased to benefit from the welfare state through some of the few universal benefits that are left, how can we convince them to fund the larger part of that budget through their taxes?' Balls accused Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne (pictured) of 'economic failure', he will say that Labour has to prepare for straitened times . Mr Balls added: 'Labour believes the allowance provides vital support for pensioners on middle and low incomes to combat fuel poverty. That's why we introduced it in the first place. 'But, at a time when the public services that pensioners and  others rely on are under strain, it can no longer be a priority to  continue paying the allowance to the wealthiest pensioners.' But last night the Tories stressed that Mr Balls' plans would cost millions to implement, slashing the savings to well under £100million a year. They also pointed to demands in his speech for higher spending on infrastructure projects as proof that Labour would continue to  borrow more, driving up Britain's deficit. The declaration will come in the most significant speech for two years by Mr Balls. Treasury minister Sajid Javid . He warned that if his party wins the 2015 election, it will have to be 'a very different kind of Labour government to those which have gone before'. Accusing Chancellor George Osborne of 'economic failure', he said that Labour has to prepare for straitened times. He said: 'This is the hard reality. The last Labour government was able to plan its 1997 manifesto on the basis of rising spending in the first years after the election. 'The next Labour government will have to plan on the basis of falling spending. Ed Miliband and I know that, and my Shadow Cabinet colleagues know that too. 'Labour must start planning now for what will be a very tough  inheritance in 2015. It will require us to govern in a very different way with much less money around. 'We will need an iron discipline and a relentless focus on our priorities.' Mr Balls pledged to 'set out a clear and balanced plan to support growth, alongside a clear timetable to get the deficit down' before the election. The Shadow Chancellor also backed calls by the International Monetary Fund for the Coalition to 'act to boost capital spending over the next two years'. This would be 'financed by a  temporary rise in borrowing as Labour has also urged – to build our way to a stronger recovery'. But Tories claim that Labour pledges made this year alone would raise borrowing by £35billion  a year. Treasury minister Sajid Javid said: 'Ed Balls' promise of discipline on spending isn't remotely credible. 'Ed Balls is incapable of admitting that Labour spent and borrowed too much in government, he has opposed every single tough decision we've taken to cut the deficit and he's still saying Labour would borrow billions more. 'The same old Labour plan for more borrowing and more debt would mean soaring interest rates with hardworking people paying the price.' Last month Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said party chiefs will 'review' whether to cut pensioner benefits such as free bus passes and TV licences. But that admission sparked confusion after a week of U-turns over whether universal benefits were under threat. Labour leader Ed Miliband had said he would 'look at' pensioner benefits before aides raced to say that he supports  universal handouts.","Shadow Chancellor admits his party would make cuts after 2015 .

A fraudster conned his local community out of thousands of pounds by pretending he had a brain tumour – which he had diagnosed himself on the internet. Gareth Wyn Francis asked local people to fund £28,000 of treatment to help him survive a brain tumour. A local church donated £1,000, while well-wishers organised raffles and collections for him. His own brother even climbed the three peaks of England, Scotland and Wales to raise money for his fictional fund. But it was revealed that he did not need the money and even spent £12,800 on decorating his house. Francis also began walking with a stick and trailing his leg behind him, claiming it was a side effect of his treatment, and shaved off his eyebrows and hair saying it happened because of chemotherapy. Francis was caught out after his worried family went to his GP saying they thought he was about to die, but were told he was not receiving any treatment. When they confronted Francis, he broke down and confessed. Frank Phillips, for Francis, of Clos Cilsaig in Dafen, said his client had been suffering headaches but instead of going to his GP he went online and self-diagnosed. 'By the time he realised, the ball was rolling and he could not find a way of stopping it,' he told Swansea Crown Court. Conned: Swansea Crown Court heard his local church donated £1,000 . Convicted: Francis received a 16 month suspended jail term at Swansea Crown Court, and was told to complete 250 hours of unpaid work . He said his client’s relationship had broken down and he had been left with debts. He said the local community now had 'grave' feelings towards him. Judge Peter Heywood told him although he could jail him immediately, he wanted him to serve a sentence in the community. He told Francis: 'You even conned members of your own family. Your illness was a complete myth. 'Instead of going to your doctor you went on the internet and self-diagnosed yourself. It was utter nonsense that you had a brain tumour.' Francis’s 16 month jail term was suspended for two years, he was also told to complete 250 hours of unpaid work.","Gareth Wyn Francis claimed to have diagnosed his illness on the internet .

The exoplanets are all scorching ‘hot Jupiters’ - a term given to massive worlds that orbit close to their stars. Because they are so hot, scientists believe the planets are unlikely to support life as we know it. Scroll down for video... Scientists found faint signatures of water in the atmospheres of five distant planets. All five planets appear to be hazy. This illustration shows a star's light illuminating the atmosphere of a planet . To determine what’s in the atmosphere of . an exoplanet, astronomers watch the planet pass in front of its host . star. When this happens, some of the star's light passes through the planet's atmosphere. This interaction imprints information on the composition and motion of the planet's atmosphere into the star's light. Scientsts can then analyse which wavelengths of light are transmitted and which are partially absorbed to detemine whether water is present in the atmosphere of the planet. However, the finding still marks an important step forward in the search for alien life, the researchers said. ‘We're very confident that we see a water signature for multiple planets,’ said Avi Mandell of Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center. ‘This work really opens the door for comparing how much water is present in atmospheres on different kinds of exoplanets — for example, hotter versus cooler ones.’ The presence of atmospheric water has been reported previously on exoplanets orbiting stars beyond our solar system. However, this is the first study to measure and compare the profiles and intensities of these signatures on multiple worlds. The team used Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 to analyse the atmospheres of the five planets, named WASP-17b, HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b and XO-1b. To determine what¿s in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, astronomers watch the planet pass in front of its host star and look at which wavelengths of light are transmitted and which are partially absorbed . The strengths of their water signatures varied with WASP-17b described as having an ‘especially puffed-up atmosphere’. ‘To actually detect the atmosphere of an exoplanet is extraordinarily difficult. But we were able to pull out a very clear signal, and it is water,’ said Drake Deming of the University of Maryland. To determine what’s in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, astronomers watch the planet pass in front of its host star and look at which wavelengths of light are transmitted and which are partially absorbed. The water signals were all less pronounced than expected, and the scientists suspect this is because a layer of haze or dust blankets each of the five planets. Hubble's high-performance Wide Field Camera 3 is one of few capable of peering into the atmospheres of exoplanets many trillions of miles away . This haze can reduce the intensity of all signals from the atmosphere in the same way fog can make colours in a photograph appear muted. At the same time, haze alters the profiles of water signals and other important molecules in a distinctive way. ‘These studies, combined with other Hubble observations, are showing us that there are a surprisingly large number of systems for which the signal of water is either attenuated or completely absent,’ said Heather Knutson of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. ‘This suggests that cloudy or hazy atmospheres may in fact be rather common for hot Jupiters.’","The planets are all scorching ‘hot Jupiters’ that orbit close to their stars .

Bing Crosby's dreams look set to come true this year as forecasters predict a white Christmas across the UK. The heavy winds, rain and flooding which have battered the nation in recent weeks are set to continue right up to December 25. But on Christmas Eve, temperatures will plummet, leaving some parts of the country covered in snow by morning - albeit a light dusting. According to the Met Office, heavy rain will pass late on Christmas Eve to make way for snowfall across the UK . Parts of the UK, including the Yorkshire Dales, already have a light coating of snow that will thicken . Eddy Carroll, chief forecaster with the Met Office, said: 'We can expect stormy weather in many areas to start the Christmas week, but looking forward to Christmas Eve and Christmas Day we are expecting it to turn colder, with a mix of wintry showers and sunny spells but for wind speeds to drop. 'So there is a chance that some places may see a White Christmas.' Officially, a white Christmas is defined as just one single snowflake falling from the sky. But those hoping to bring the sledge down from the loft or dress a snowman with scarf and hat might be a little disappointed - unless you live in the mountains of Scotland. 'It's not going to be cold enough for . widespread snow, it's more of a showery picture,' said Chris Burton, . from weather forecasters MeteoGroup. 'There . will be a bit of sleet and snow on the higher ground, such as the hills . of Wales and in northern England, and wintry showers will be heavy in . the mountains of Scotland. Rain: Extreme weather conditions have battered the UK for days, filling rivers and streams, like this one in Wiltshire, to the brim. Rain is set to continue right up until December 25 . 'But it's probably not going to be a white Christmas in central London.' Widespread covering of snow on the ground - where more than 40 per cent . of Britain's stations reported snow on the ground at 9am - has happened . just four times in the last 52 years. Christmas 2010 was the last white Christmas. With a thick layer of snow coating the nation, it was extremely unusual. Snow . on the ground was recorded at 83 per cent of stations, the highest ever . recorded, and snow or sleet also fell at 19 per cent of stations. While most dream of gardens blanketed with crisp, white snow, the Met Office says the definition is of a single snowflake falling in the 24 hours of December 25. But we are often left disappointed as climate history shows wintry weather is more likely between January and March. Snow or sleet falls on average five days in December, compared to 7.6 days in January, 6.8 days in February and six days in March. But we can remain optimistic as at least one snowflake has fallen on 38 Christmases in the last 52 years. Snow lying on the ground on Christmas Day is much rarer. White Christmases were more frequent in the 18th and 19th centuries, according to the Met Office. The change of calendar in 1752, which effectively brought Christmas Day back by 12 days, also minimised the chances. Climate change has also brought higher average temperatures over land and sea, which generally reduces the probability of a white Christmas. But experts claim that will not make them less likely in the future. There . was also a white Christmas in 2009, when 13 per cent of stations . recorded snow or sleet falling, and 57 per cent reported snow on the . ground. Until then, the weather is set to be blustery and extreme across the nation. Much . of the weekend will be cool and showery, the Met Office said, with low . pressure developing over the Atlantic on Sunday and passing to the north . west of the UK on Monday and into Tuesday. That . low pressure will bring widespread strong winds and heavy rain from . Monday morning for 24 hours, and the Met Office has issued severe . weather warnings for wind and rain across the South West and northern . areas of the UK for the next few days, bringing the possibility of . flooding. Travellers . expected to crowd on to trains, boats and planes over Christmas have . been warned to take care as Britain enters some of the busiest days of . the year for the transport system. Those hoping for an easy ride could find the journey hampered by a stormy few days. Parts of western Scotland could see up to 20in of rain, and 10 to 15in the south-west of England as the unsettled outlook continues. The rest of the UK will also see much the same which has led to a series of weather warnings being put in place for later with gale force winds and more heavy rain forecast. Met Office forecaster Dan Williams warned that anyone using the roads for their Christmas getaways should be careful. He said: 'Driving conditions won't be good, there will be strong winds across the country today and rain. We would advise people to allow extra time for their journeys and drive to the conditions.' A spokesman for the Environment Agency said: 'People who are set to be away from home for the festive period are urged to check the flood situation and take precautionary steps to prepare, for example by moving valuable items to safety, before travelling. 'People are also urged to check the flood risk situation for their journey and at their destination. 'People are also being urged not to drive through dangerous flood water. The Environment Agency has teams on the ground checking flood defences and monitoring river levels and will have teams ready to respond throughout the Christmas period.' Travellers are warned to take care when driving over the Christmas period as temperatures plummet . A white Christmas is technically when one snowflake falls, which has happened 38 Christmases in the last 52 years. Widespread snow has only occurred four times in the same time period . John McTaggart, head of on-road services at the Highways Agency, said: 'We are working closely with the Met Office to monitor conditions ahead of the weather being forecast for next week. 'Road users are urged to check traffic and weather conditions before setting out on journeys and to heed any advice such as speed restrictions once they are on motorways and major trunk roads. 'We aware of sudden gusts of wind, and give high-sided vehicles, caravans, motorbikes and bicycles plenty of space. In the event of persistent high winds we may need to close certain bridges to traffic for a period, so please be alert for warnings of closures and follow signposted diversion routes.'","Heavy rain and wind to subside on Christmas Eve with snow by morning .

Too young: 8-year-old Noshat Nahian died today after being truck by a tractor-trailer on his walk to school in Queens, New York . An 8-year-old Bangladeshi boy was fatally hit by a tractor-trailer this morning in Queens while walking to school on the last day of classes before holiday break. Third-grader Noshat Nahian was walking with his 11-year-old sister to Public School 152 around 8am, clutching a red gift bag for his teacher, when driver Mauricio Osorio-Palominos struck the boy with the back wheels of his tractor-trailor. Police arrested the 51-year-old from Newark, New Jersey when they discovered he was driving on a suspended license. He was headed southbound on sixty-first street, turning left onto Northern Boulevard, when the incident happened, just half a block from Noshat's school. Noshat's mother usually walked her two children the four blacks to school, but stayed behind this morning. Maria Humala, 38, was walking behind the siblings when the accident happened. 'The kid was wearing a hood and looking down, he kept walking and went under the truck,'  Ms Humala told the New York Post. 'The little girl was frozen beside him.' A neighbor of the family's heard the sister scream and then saw the boy lying in the road, his face bloody with visibly broken limbs. Noshat's sister ran home to get her mother, who met her son at Elmhurst Hospital. She was able to be with him when he later died. Arrested: The driver who hit him was arrested by police (center) when they discovered he was driving on a suspended license . Run over: The driver was turning left onto Northern Boulevard when he hit Noshat. The third-grader had on a hoodie and walked right under the tractor-trailer . Tragedy: Noshat was just half a block from his school when he was hit. He was carrying a red gift bag to give to his teacher on the last day of classes before holiday break . The driver seems received his commercial driving license in 1985 and has had 17 violations since then. His licesnse has been suspended and reinstated three times before. In May 2012, he was cited for dangerous driving after getting into an accident. Some of his past violations include failing to comply with police instruction, ignoring traffic signals, seat belt violations and speeding. Osorio-Palominos owns his own trucking business - Gamosse transportation. He is the only employee of the one-truck business. Suspended license: Since receiving his commercial driving license in 1985, Mauricio Osorio-Palominos has had his license suspended and reinstated three times . The boy's father, 40-year-old Mohammed Osma Miah, works as a delivery man for a rice wholesaler while his mother works at a store in Jackson Heights. Mr Miah told DNAinfo that the family had moved from Bangladesh to the United States just months before after visiting family here. He said they decided to stay because Noshat had fallen in love with the neighborhood in Queens. 'If we left that moment maybe he wouldn't have died,' he said. Record: Osorio-Palominos 17 prior violations include failing to comply with police instruction, ignoring traffic signals, seat belt violations violations and speeding . Mr Miah was clearly distraught when being interviewed, wailing 'My son, my only son', and talked about how he was saving up to buy Noshat a laptop. While Noshat's father blames himself, locals spoke about how dangerous the intersection is - pointing out that there's not usually a crossing guard stationed across the six-lane boulevard. 'That intersection is very dangerous,' 43-year-old Ruhel Hassan told the New York Times. 'People speed, and there's no crossing guard. Once my kid almost got run over.' According to administrators at P.S. 152, crisis counselors have been brought in to any students who may need their help over the break.

The care worker broke two vertebrae in her spine after leaping 10ft from a bathroom window to escape a schizophrenic who was threatening to kill her . A care worker broke her spine after jumping from a bathroom window to escape a sex pest schizophrenic who was threatening to kill her, a court heard. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was forced into the bathroom after Craig Cantwell, who has learning difficulties, asked for paracetamol to ease a headache. The care worker, who was the only member of staff working at the Birkenhead home on the evening of July 8, took Cantwell upstairs to the medication room. Once inside the medication room, the 29-year-old schizophrenic locked the door behind them, trapping the care worker inside. He pushed the woman into the drugs cabinet and told her to go into the adjoining bathroom, adding: 'You will be safer in the bathroom because if you stay in here I will kill you.' Cantwell, who had stacked items against the door of the room trapping them inside, grabbed hold of the care worker demanding she bend over before pointing at his groin and telling her he was aroused. Cantwell denied inflicting grievous bodily harm, affray and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence but was convicted after a four-day trial. Prosecutor Anya Horwood told Liverpool Crown Court, the terrified woman locked herself in the bathroom. She managed to call her manager but the phone rang out as Cantwell yelled at her through the door, threatening to kill her, smashing a hole in the wall. The care worker leapt 10ft from the window breaking two vertebrae in her spine and injuring her heel. But despite her broken back she managed to get to the road and shout for help. Two milkmen, out on their early morning rounds, helped her into their van to keep her safe. Cantwell appeared wielding a metal pole, telling the milkmen 'Don't mess with me, I'm from Manchester'. Craig Cantwell, a schizophrenic with learning difficulties, denied inflicting grievous bodily harm, affray and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence. The 29-year-old was found guilty after a four-day trial at Liverpool Crown Court, pictured . One of the men, Edward Pike, stood in his way prompting Cantwell to hit the back of the van and a nearby car, snapping the pole in two. He disappeared but returned holding a piece of wood in each hand. Mr Pike walked towards him and Cantwell backed off. At his trial, Cantwell denied inflicting grievous bodily harm, affray and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence. He was convicted by a jury of seven women and five men after four days of evidence. When police detained Cantwell after the 25-minute attack, he said he believed they were arresting him for trying to help the woman when she suffered an asthma attack. He told officers he had drunk two or three cans of lager and thought he might have taken sleeping tablets. He told the court he hit the plasterboard wall because the woman was having an asthma attack and said he had flicked her to the head accidentally. He claimed he grabbed the metal pole and pieces of wood in self-defence. Remanding Cantwell in custody while psychiatric reports are prepared, Judge Conrad said he when the case reconvenes for sentencing he will be passing comment on the way the care home was run. He told the court: 'There is evidence she should not have been put in the position she was.'","Craig Cantwell barricaded the care worker in the medication room, threatening to kill her before telling her he was aroused .

A paint sprayer who had been doing extra shifts in order to pay for his wedding next year has been killed in an apparently motiveless attack while he made his way home from work. Simon Holdsworth, 36, died of severe injuries after being attacked by 'one or more' people as he walked across fields close to his home in Sheffield, South Yorks. Simon was due to marry his fiance Carleen McKeown in August and had just booked time off work, and was also about to celebrate his stepson's fourth birthday on Christmas eve. Scroll down for video . Simon Holdsworth, 36, (left) was killed while making his way home from work where he had been doing extra shifts to pay for his wedding. He was last seen on the 120 bus in Sheffield on Monday (right) Speaking through tears at a police press conference yesterday Carleen said: 'Simon was my rock. He was a bright shining light in my life we were so happy together as a family. 'It will be Tiarnan's fourth birthday on Christmas Eve. We had already been Christmas shopping and his presents are wrapped but his daddy won't be there to open them with him anymore. 'Simon's death has ripped my life apart.' Police are appealing for anyone who was on the 120 bus between Mansfield Road, Intake, and Birley Spa Lane at around 11pm on Monday night to contact them with information. He was due to marry fiance Carleen McKeown in August next year and was looking forward to celebrating stepson Tiarnan's fourth birthday on Christmas eve . Simon boarded the bus after finishing a shift at work and was on it for around fifteen minutes before he and another passenger got off and walked in different directions. He then cut across some fields at the back of a Primary School, part of his regular walk home, where police think he was attacked moments later. His body was found by a member of the public at 6.30 the following morning. Simon's mother Christine Holdsworth said: 'What has happened to Simon has devastated our lives. We are such a close family and this has left a huge hole with all of us. Simon's mother, Christine Holdsworth, said: 'You protect your children all your life and the one time he really needed me, I wasn't there' 'Simon was over the moon to be getting married next year. Simon would never, ever hurt anybody and we can't understand why anybody would want to hurt him. 'You protect your children all your life and the one time he really needed me, I wasn't there.' Simon was a keen fisher and an avid fan of Sheffield Wednesday football club, where he was a season ticket holder. A wreath has been placed on Simon's seat in the North Stand at Hillsborough and during today's game against Bournemouth the player wore black armbands. Paying tribute to Simon, his boss Paul Essex said: 'During the last shift he ever did, Simon was in a bubbly and cheerful mood as he'd just that day booked the time off work for his wedding and honeymoon in August. 'He'd worked here for 16 years and was one of life's grafters. Over the past few weeks he'd been working extra hours to save up for his wedding which we know he was really excited about. 'The entire workforce is absolutely devastated by what has happened. We haven't just lost a colleague, we've lost a close friend. Simon was gentle, kind and loved by everyone. 'I would urge anybody with any information at all to come forward and tell the police. Whoever did this has to be caught and brought to justice.'

Disgraced former Labour minister Denis MacShane will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on Monday after admitting making bogus expense claims amounting to nearly £13,000. The ex-MP pleaded guilty last month to false accounting by filing 19 fake receipts for 'research and translation' services. He used the money to fund a series of trips to Europe, including one to judge a literary competition in Paris. The maximum jail term available is seven years, but the former MP is likely to get less. MacShane was granted unconditional bail when he entered his plea. Today in central London his sentencing was postponed until Monday at 10am. The judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, said he wanted time to reflect before reaching a decision. He allowed MacShane to spend the weekend on bail but said that was not an indication of his sentence. The judge told MacShane: 'You have heard me make very clear that in doing that I am giving you no indication whatsoever what the sentence is going to be.' Numerous former colleagues entered good character pleas for MacShane. Labour deputy leader Harriett Harman paid tribute to MacShane's 'great depth of knowledge on Europe'. She described him as 'well liked and admired by leaders in politics throughout Europe', adding: 'I have never known him to be duplicitous, financially greedy, or deceptive.' Another character reference concluded: 'A cutter of corners, yes, a cavalier crusaders, yes, but a self-centred and greedy crook, certainly not.' Mark Milliken-Smith QC, defending, said MacShane has 'suffered the shame, opprobrium, and loss of life's work and reputation'. He told the court MacShane had suffered an 'extraordinary serious of devastating blows', including the death of his daughter and divorce from his wife, when he committed the offences. He said MacShane admitted wrongdoing when first challenged over the expenses by Parliamentary authorities. Mr Milliken-Smith also pointed out MacShane had not chosen to contest the decision to charge him, despite being assured in July 2012 that he would face no criminal proceedings. Parliamentary authorities began looking at MacShane's claims in 2009 when the wider MPs expenses scandal engulfed Westminster. He was referred to Scotland Yard within months. However, due to Parliamentary privilege, officers were unable to access damning evidence in which MacShane detailed how signatures on receipts from the European Policy Institute (EPI) had been faked. It was not until after police dropped . the case last year that the cross-party standards committee published . the evidence in a report that recommended an unprecedented 12 month . suspension from the House. Police then reopened their probe in the . light of the fresh information and he was charged in May. MacShane was found to have submitted 19 claims for direct payments to the EPI between January 2005 and January 2008. In power: MacShane, pictured in 2002 with then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, served as Europe minister under Tony Blair . The invoices were signed by MacShane under the name of E.J.Matthews, the general manager of the company based at an address in New Kings Road, Fulham, southwest London. MacShane's brother Edmund Matyjaszek was interviewed in 2011 and denied he created the invoices. He . stated that EPI was set up by MacShane to publish books and conferences . but became dormant in 1994 and the office was used as a mail holding . service. The MP admitted in a prepared statement during interview in December 2011 that he set up EPI in 1992. Prosecutor . Peter Wright QC said in court today: 'He opened a bank account in EPI's . name. He used the name Eric Matthews as a nom de plume so as not to . associate him publicly with the publication of material. 'He said he thought his association with a pro-European think tank might hinder his career in the Labour party. 'Some . of this work was requested by those in office for him to undertake and . it is accepted he did have special expertise in European affairs.' Some of the forged invoices used variations in his titles and in one case the spelling of his surname as 'McShane', the court heard today. In the spotlight: MacShane stepped down from his post as MP for Rotherham last year following the scandal . Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said: 'He had taken the deliberate and dishonest step of providing not only false invoices but taking the time and effort in variance of his own name and honorifics. 'This was done simply to give the impression he was not the author of the document and to conceal the falsity of it.' MacShane, who served as Europe minister under Tony Blair, resigned as MP for Rotherham last November before the punishment could be imposed. He is understood to accept that he made a 'grotesque mistake', but argues there was no personal gain from the claims. The Glasgow-born politician, who was elected as MP for Rotherham in 1994, is the sixth MP to face court proceedings over the expenses scandal that rocked Westminster. Elliot Morley, David Chaytor, Jim Devine, and Eric Illsley were locked up in 2011 for fiddling their expenses - all four men have now been released from prison. Margaret Moran, who fiddled £53,000 in the worst case of dishonesty in the scandal, was let off with a two-year supervision and treatment order last December after claims she was suffering from mental illness. Between them they claimed around £127,000, of which former environment minister Morley admitted to claiming more than £30,000. Two Tory peers, Lord John Taylor of Warwick and Lord Paul White of Hanningfield, were jailed for cheating the taxpayer of around £25,000.","Ex-MP pleaded guilty last month to false accounting by filing 19 receipts .

Yvonne Doyle has been jailed for seven years after being found guilty of stealing a dead child's identity in order to falsely claim £250,000 in benefits . A mother of two stole a dead child’s identity and posed as a vicar as part of a £265,000 benefits swindle. Over 20 years, Yvonne Doyle fraudulently obtained birth and marriage certificates for people both alive and dead. The woman used them to apply for driving licences, passports and national . insurance numbers to claim state handouts at a variety of addresses. Brazen . Doyle, 63, who came to this country in 1988 after being accused of dumping a swastika-emblazoned pig’s head on the steps of a Synagogue in South Africa claimed carer’s allowance under one name. She then used a . second alias to grab disability benefits as the person supposedly being . cared for. Reading Crown . Court, where Doyle was jailed for seven years on Thursday, heard that . one of the identities she hijacked was that of Carol Ann Naylor, who . died at the age of four in 1951. She . used the same surname to pose as a vicar called Rev Naylor, and also . stole the identity of a woman called Bridgette Meally, who died in 1999, . to claim £10,000 in carer’s allowances. In . total, Doyle swindled £173,959 from the Department of Work  and . Pensions, £39,149 from  Milton Keynes Council, and a further £52,279 . from financial institutions, netting more than £265,000. Among the handouts she falsely claimed were council tax and housing benefit, disability living allowance and carers’ allowance. Her . trial was told the ‘clever, manipulative, bold and wholly dishonest’ woman also claimed to be disabled and in need of a wheelchair or . crutches to move about. But . neighbours regularly saw her walking to the shops and gardening. Doyle . was arrested in December 2009 after a routine financial audit by DWP . investigators. Police then . found a suitcase dubbed a ‘fraudster’s tool kit’ containing fake . identification documents when they raided her daughter’s home. Tim . Naylor, prosecuting, said: ‘This was a professionally planned fraud. 'Identity documents were obtained in a . number of different names and identities and this was carried out over a . significant period of time.' Jurors . refused to believe Doyle’s claims that the charges were ‘trumped up’ and linked to a ‘fatwa’ placed on her by South Africa’s Chief Rabbi. In a letter she sent while refusing to appear before magistrates in 2011, the fraudster said: 'The alleged amounts have been manufactured and this was done in order to give the false appearance of high value crime.' Doyle added: 'I do not believe I will . get a fair trial due to the involvement of Jews and Freemasons. In 1988 a . fatwa, for want of a better word, was declared on me by the chief Rabbi . of South Africa.' Following . the case, it was revealed that during the Eighties she spent three years in South Africa . but fled after being accused of the attempted murder of a . gardener and an anti-Semitic attack. Doyle - who attended court in a wheelchair despite witnesses saying they had seen her gardening without help - had claimed the charges were part of a 'fatwa' issued by the chief Rabbi of her native South Africa . Doyle fled South Africa in 1988 after being accused of dumping a swastika-emblazoned pig’s head on the steps of a Synagogue. The con-artist, who was then going by the name Yvonne Malone, also evaded a charge of attempted murder in that same year after she shot and wounded a gardener at her property in Durban. A South African newspaper reported that in April 1988 worshippers at the Great Synagogue and Jewish Club on Durban’s beachfront found a pig’s head, decorated with a swastika on the forehead and a Star of David on each ear, on the front steps. An identical pig’s head was also found by members of the congregation at the rear of the property. Doyle, who owned a steak house, was arrested after the butcher who sold her the heads contacted police. She tried to escape being charged by . using another fake name to ring a local newspaper and claim she had seen . a group of Neo-Nazis march up to the steps and dump the heads. The . report revealed that Doyle also faced a charge of attempted murder, and . was alleged to have shot and wounded a gardener at the duplex where she . lived. The conwoman, . then 38, failed to appear before a South African Court and was believed . by the authorities to have fled the country.

As far as end-of-year budget spending goes, this is one decision some consider not only a waste of taxpayers' money... but also 'pants'. The Czech Republic's environment ministry has sparked outrage after ordering 1,000 pairs of male and female underwear as its 2013 budget spend deadline fast approaches. To make matters worse, the women's knickers have a picture of a beaver on them - a move that has been branded sexist, while the men's come adorned with a cormorant. The Czech Republic's environment ministry has sparked outrage after ordering 1,000 pairs of male and female underwear, decorated with images of beavers and cormorants, as its 2013 budget spend deadline fast approaches . According to the department, the £18,000 purchasing spree, which also includes cufflinks, umbrellas, pencils, crayons and 6,000 pens, will serve to highlight its Czech Nature campaign and encourage people to take a more active role in environmental protection . However, green campaigners Hnuti Duha (Friends of the Earth Czech Republic) called the decision 'pathetic'. 'It’s completely stupid. It’s so stupid, I can’t find English words for it. I am shocked but not surprised,' Jan Pinos, a spokesman for the group told the Prague Post. 'The money could have been spent much more sensibly on real nature conservation and national parks and landscape protection.' Green campaigner Jan Pinos lambasted the ministry, headed by Tomas Podivisnky (above), accusing it of sexism . Pinos also accused the ministry, headed by Tomas Podivisnky, of sexism. He added that it was misleading to promote the issue of nature conservation with beavers and cormorants, as both animals were recently taken off the country's protected species list. Meanwhile, Ondrej Liska, chairman of the Czech Green Party, said the ministry should 'spend the money on helping to protect human health and the environment' rather than make 'rash decisions on spending,' according to the Daily Telegraph. Podivinksy argued that the underwear was a far more powerful way to put across his department's message than pens and umbrellas. He said: 'If you ask me, they have already triggered intensive discussions about our nature, and it is has been done in an interesting and captivating way.' Pinos also voiced concern over the number of 'real experts' who had been fired from the ministry for not toeing the line of the former ruling party, the Christian Democrats, calling it a 'complete disaster'. It is not the first time the environment ministry has come under fire over spending. Podivinsky recently announced that he plans to replace his department's fleet with 130 new cars.","Ministry blew £18,000 on pants, umbrellas and 6,000 pens .

With just four days until Christmas, crowds gathered under the arches of Wells Cathedral for one of the longest-running carol services in the country. According to the church's archives, the choir has been marking occassions such as Christmas since 909 AD. The 36 choristers - 18 boys and 18 girls - go through meticulous trials, train habitually, and tour internationally. Hundreds came together last night under the 'scissor arches' of Wells Cathedral lit just by candlelight to watch the 36 choristers mark Christmas . The boys and girls sang with older members of the cathedral's singing groups . For the carol service, they are joined by the Vicars Choral, nine professional singers and vicars in the cathedral. The candlelight affair, conducted by Matthew Owens and accompanied by Jonathan Vaughn on the organ, took place under the scissor arches in the main hall. Though many believe them to be modern additions, the ecclesiastical arches were built in 1348 as a quick fix for the spire which was beginning to show cracks. The choir in Somerset dates back to 909 AD and has survived through the 1104 years . The members go through meticulous trials and train habitually, before performing in numerous concerts and touring the world . Architects tried many different . techniques to strengthen the building internally, until the famous . â€˜scissor archesâ€™ were constructed by William Joy in a last ditch . attempt.

If you get into the festive spirit the moment you hear a Christmas song or see rows of tinsel for sale, you’re best advised to keep clear of these roads. Streets such as Tinsel Lane, Noel Road, Frosty Hollow and Advent Way may look out of place in the summer months - but they come into their own in December. Research by Royal Mail staff has found that the UK has 3,369 Christmas-themed street names, based on analysis of every street name in the nation. Festively-named Tinsel Lane in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, was this year decorated by residents Michelle Orton and her three-year-old son, Matthew . Sisters Niamh Davey (left), eight, and Ciara Davey, five, pose in front of their street name - which might look a bit out of place in the summer - in Northampton .

The research also found that the Midlands has a total of 560 Christmas street names, more than any other region in the UK. The region has a grand total of 560 Christmas themed street names and enjoys festive street names such as Reindeer Road, Noel Street, Bell Close and the ubiquitous Holly Street. The ratings came from analysis of Royal Mail’s database of all 29 million UK addresses. The database also reveals our love for Santa’s Reindeers, with seven of the nine reindeers represented on a street name. These include: Dasher, Dancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner and Rudolph. Residents of Tinsel Lane in Nuneaton have this year made a particularly big effort by dressing their sign up like a Christmas tree. Three-year-old Matthew and his mother, Michelle Orton, have already been to decorate the street sign in tinsel. Meanwhile, Frosty Hollow in Northampton will attract many festive photographs during this month. And sisters Niamh Davey, eight, and Ciara, five, appear to have beaten their friends to it, dressed in their Christmas hats. Noel Road, in Ealing, West London, takes a little more imagination but can still be considered a very Christmassy-sounding street, if pronounced in the right way . Reindeer Close is a little more blatant, and is bound to get East London residents in the Christmas spirit come December . Four-year-old Poppy Grout poses for a photograph with her grandmother, Jane Long, near their home on Mistletoe Green, Oxford . On this picture evidence, though, not as . much fun is being had in London, where festive-themed street signs are . more common and treated with less enthusiasm. Some of the signs pictured take a little bit of festive imagination, such as Noel Road, which takes a special pronunciation, and Star Road. But in other cases - Reindeer Close and Holly Way - there can be no escaping the Christmassy significance of the names. Turkey Street might get Enfield residents in the mood for their Christmas dinner, but they have to travel all the way to Tower Hamlets to find Cranberry Lane . Three Kings Yard in the City of Westminster, London, provides a festive name with a more biblical background . You have to use your imagination a little, but at least one resident of Star Road in Caversham, Reading, recognised the Christmas reference . At the other end of the street from Matthew, three, and mother Michelle Orton, housewife Sue Wykes poses with her decorated Tinsel Lane sign .

The Nation reported that crew sent the pilot's request to the national carrier's catering department and then to PIA's management office in Karachi.

Two former soldiers have been jailed for six years each for firebombing a mosque in the aftermath of Lee Rigby's murder. Stuart Harness - who was once based at Woolwich Barracks - and Gavin Humphries were caught on camera throwing petrol bombs at an Islamic centre, having previously filmed themselves making the weapons on their own CCTV system. They were jailed today at Hull Crown Court by judge Mark Bury, who criticised them for targeting 'law-abiding Muslims' in a misguided attempt at revenge for Rigby's death at the hands of Islamic terrorists. Scroll down to see the CCTV . Attack: Stuart Harness and Gavin Humphries were caught on CCTV bombing an Islamic cultural centre . Jailed: Harness, left, and Humphries, right, have each been sentenced to six years in prison . The pair admitted arson, while an accomplice, Daniel Cressy, was jailed for three years after being found guilty of aiding and abetting them. 'This was a crime of violence where a particular religious group was deliberately targeted in an act of retribution,' the judge said. 'This kind of attack cannot be tolerated. A severe sentence is required to punish but, more importantly, to deter.' Mr Bury acknowledged the outrage felt over the killing of Lee Rigby by two extremists who were yesterday convicted of murder, but said that Harness, 34, and Humphries, 37, had gone the wrong way about expressing their anger. Reprisal: The two former soldiers were apparently trying to avenge the terrorism death of Lee Rigby . Explosion: A judge criticised the pair for wrongly targeting 'law-abiding Muslims' 'Whatever your feelings of outrage were, you should have allowed justice to take its course,' he said. 'Instead you carried out a retaliatory act of throwing petrol bombs at the Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre. 'As is usual in these cases, the victims had nothing to do with the events that so enraged you. They were entirely innocent law-abiding Muslims who were practising their religion in a peaceable way.' The court heard how Harness and Humphries launched two petrol bombs each at the mosque in Grimsby on May 26 - four days after Fusilier Rigby was murdered. They were spotted by police community support officers and followed back to Harness's nearby house where they were arrested. Detectives found they had inadvertently filmed themselves bringing petrol into the house, building the bombs and leaving with them on a CCTV systems at Harness' home. Caught in the act: The pair were filmed making the petrol bombs at Harness' house . Red-handed: Harness apparently did not realise that he had left his own CCTV camera rolling . Heading off: Harness and Humphries were then seen carrying their home-made petrol bombs to the scene of the crime . Accomplice: Daniel Cressey was jailed for three years for helping the pair carry out the attack . The CCTV footage, excerpts of which were played to Hull Crown Court, showed the whole process of making the bombs until they left in Cressey's car. Jeremy Evans, prosecuting, said the bombs exploded outside the main doors of the mosque. He said it was 'lucky' that the people remaining in the building were just on the other side of the doors and realised quickly what was happening. They put out the flames despite being scared and there were no injuries and minimal damage. The judge heard how both Harness and Humphries served in the Army with unblemished records. Mr Evans told the court how Harness had been in the Army for 13 years and experienced 'active warfare' during deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. He said Harness had been based at Woolwich Barracks, where Rigby was also based and outside which he was hacked to death by Michael Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo. Richard Hackfath, defending Humphries, said his client had also served in the Army with distinction, most notably as a close protection officer for senior officers. He added that the defendant was not a racist, and had previously worked in Qatar teaching English to local Muslim children. Charlotte Baines, for Harness, said her client apologied for his 'foolish, absurd and reckless behaviour' and said he was 'ashamed and disgusted' by what he had done. Return: The camera also showed the moment when the attackers returned to the home afterwards . Blast: The explosion was so large it could even be seen by a camera in a nearby car park . Fury: The crime took place just four days after the killing of Lee Rigby in Woolwich . Cressey drove the other two men to the mosque but did not throw any of the bombs, the judge heard. The judge said the offences were all religiously aggravated. Speaking after the case concluded, a spokesman for the Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre said: 'Our faith teaches us that in order to be perfect Muslims, we have to be model citizens of the area in which we live. 'It is with that aspiration that we want to move forward now and leave the events of May 26 behind.' Det Sgt Stewart Watson, from the Serious Crime Team in Grimsby, said: 'We welcome the sentences handed to the three men. 'This was a very serious offence that could have resulted in people inside the mosque being fatally injured, thankfully nobody was inside at the time and only minimal damage was caused to the building. 'These three men took it upon themselves to react to incidents happening elsewhere in the country and retaliated by targeting the Islamic Centre.'","Stuart Harness, 34, and Gavin Humphries, 37, pleaded guilty to arson .

Many retailers are slashing prices by more than 70 per cent in a last-ditch bid to tempt people through the tills. One industry insider said: ‘The high street is a bit of a bloodbath. Everyone is on promotion. ‘Some . retailers went on some sort of sale really early this year, which makes . it very difficult for others to hold their full price position. ‘There . is also the weird psychology of Christmas falling on a Wednesday, which . means people are shopping later and think they have got more time. ‘Unless retailers really hold their nerve you end up with this intense promotional landscape.’ Andrew .

Supermarket giant Tesco has revealed half of all its Christmas sales this year have been online.

This represents a significant rise of online purchasing compared last year. Online . purchases represented 20 per cent of the total sales of present in . Christmas 2012, so the trend towards more online shopping is clear. Tesco says this is undoubtedly spurred on by increased use of mobile devices. The average price discount is 46 per cent – a greater cut than the 44 per cent recorded at the same time last year. Mark Hudson, retail consulting leader at PwC, said: ‘As we all get ready for that frantic last weekend of shopping before the big day … promotions are still a key weapon to drive footfall. ‘Expect to see further sale activity on the final two days as savvy last-minute shoppers hold out for pre-Christmas bargains.’ Tesco is opening more than 500 stores around the clock between now and Christmas Eve, except for Sunday, while Asda is trading 24 hours a day from more than 200 outlets.

Britain's longest-serving Father Christmas has donned the festive suit for more than half a century - and has no intention of hanging up his beard and buckled red suit. Grandfather Ray Hulse, 69, has been playing the bearded gift-bringer since he was just 18 and has been spreading yuletide joy for 51 years. Ray Hulse, 69, Britain's longest serving Father Christmas pictured in his suit back in 1967 . He is so committed to his role that he has built his own sledge and created a grotto out of his own garage. Thousands of gleeful children have sat on his knee and he has distributed hundreds upon hundreds of gifts to make Christmas dreams come true since 1962. He had always loved Christmas and was determined to spread the festive cheer as much as he could. Retired carpet fitter Ray, from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, created his first grotto at a simple Ford garage - with people coming from far and wide to offer Santa their Christmas wish list. Grandfather Ray Hulse, 69, seen here in 1994 has been playing the bearded gift-bringer since he was just 18 . He said: 'I started out there then I did one in a scout hut and it just grew from there. 'At first, I had to borrow a costume. But it soon took off and became so popular that I had my own costume made.' 'I used to ask for donations, I used to raise around Â£15 in old money. But it's got better and better since then. 'I'd raise money for the Church of England's waifs and strays, then I started to do it for other charities. 'I wouldn't like to guess how much I've raised down the years, but I imagine it must be around Â£50,000.' Not only has he been entertaining children over all these years, Christmas-loving grown-ups have also sat on his knee . As the years rolled on, Ray took his role as Santa more seriously. He built his own sledge - complete with 'Santa 1' registration plate - and he even had a custom-made suit created. The hospitals Ray visits this year will all provide him with gifts to give to the sick children, which is a far cry from the early years when he used to beg high street shops for freebies for him to take around the wards. But one thing that hasn't changed over five decades is the feeling the experienced Santa gets when he dons the famous outfit and says 'ho ho ho'. Ray, who has two sons with wife Kath, 71, . said: 'The magic is in the expressions that you see on the kids' faces. That's the reward.

'Sometimes I'll joke with them, and tell them that they were naughty last year because their mummy or daddy left the fire burning and I burned my bum. 'Or I'll tell them I came down their chimney and got covered in soot. 'A lot of these modern houses don't have chimney pots, so I tell the children that Santa has a magic key. 'I ask if they want to touch it, the expression on their faces when they are touching my magic key is extraordinary. 'It's those little touches that make it special for them.

Private contractors Serco has agreed to repay £68.5million to the taxpayer after over-charging for tagging criminals. The firm was investigated by the Ministry of Justice over claims that together with rival company G4S it over-charged for tens of thousands of criminals, including those who had left the country, been returned to prison or even died. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling condemned the 'wholly unacceptable' conduct, but also hit out at his own department which 'had been found wanting' in its handling of the contracts. Fired: Security giants Serco and G4S have been dumped as the contractors responsible for tagging thousands of criminals . Today it emerged Serco has agreed to pay £68.5million for overcharging for electronic tagging contracts which were not properly delivered. The sum also included costs incurred during the investigation. They had already agreed to return £2million in past profits after it was found staff claimed to have escot prisoners to courts when they had not. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has already been called in to investigate Serco and G4S over electronic tagging. In addition, G4S has been referred to the . SFO again after the Ministry of Justice uncovered further problems with . two contracts for facilities management in the courts. An audit by big four accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, launched in May, alleged that overcharging began at least as far back as the start of the current contracts in 2005. Mr Grayling said: 'From the outset I made clear that I intended to take robust action to deal with evidence of unacceptable conduct by suppliers under my department’s contracts, and to recover any monies overpaid as a result of these practices.' He went on: 'Unlike Serco, G4S has not yet agreed a position on repayment. However, discussions are ongoing and I remain determined to pursue all legal options to recover the taxpayer’s money. 'While it is evident that both suppliers’ conduct under these contracts has been wholly unacceptable, I made clear in my statement in July that my department had been found wanting in its management of the electronic monitoring contracts.' Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has called in rival firm Capita to run carry out the work on an interim basis . The UK-based security firm traces its roots back to a guarding company founded in Denmark in 1901. G4S was formed when Group 4 merged with Securicor in 2004. The company has a long record of blunders including: . In 1993 Group 4 became the first private company to run prisoner escort services,m and lost seven inmates in three weeks . A year later a hunger striker escaped from Campsfield House detention centre, guarded by Group 4 . In 1997 it emerged the firm had transferred a prisoner between two vans on a petrol station forecourt . Three prisoners escaped from Peterborough Crown Court in 2001 . In . 2011, G4S staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over . Birmingham Prison Workers put an electronic tag on criminal Christopher . Lowcock's artificial limb . In 2012 the firm failed to train enough guards for the London Games which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave . In March this year a G4S guard at Heathrow ordered Royal Navy engineer Nicky Howse to change out . of her uniform before flying to the US because it was 'offensive' Francis Maude, minister for the Cabinet Office, which led the broader review of Serco and G4S contracts, said: 'It's good news for taxpayers that Serco has agreed to recompense £68.5 million for overcharging. 'We are confident that the company is taking steps to address the issues which our review has identified. 'Since day one this Government has been working to reform contract management and improve commercial expertise in Whitehall.' Bill Crothers, chief procurement officer for the Government, who led the review, said: 'Opening up public services to a diverse range of suppliers means that we can access the innovation that the public sector, private companies and the voluntary sectors can bring. 'We need the very best commercial skills to be able to make the most of these opportunities and we know that these skills are not yet strong enough across Government.' The . government launched a review of all contracts with G4S and Serco signed . by every government department after doubts were raised about the use . of taxpayers’ money. The scandal could date back as far as 1999, when tagging of criminals began in England and Wales. Since then the taxpayer has spent £1billion on tagging and monitoring offenders. The current contracts began in 2005. In . some cases private contractors charged the Government for years after . tagging had stopped and cases included being charged for tags for dead . people. G4S has . apologised and offered to repay £24.1 million. A spokesman said it accepted it ‘wrongly . considered itself to be contractually entitled to bill for monitoring . services when equipment had not been fitted or after it had been . removed’. The company insisted an . independent review it commissioned ‘has not identified any evidence of . dishonesty or criminal conduct by any employee’. But the Ministry of Justice made clear that the government would not accept the voluntary offer. A National Audit Office report into . the electronic monitoring contracts found evidence the . firms were charging for multiple tags on individual criminals. In one case Serco charged more than £15,000 for monitoring an offender whose home was not even fitted with the equipment.","Tagging scandal suggests one in six of 18,000 tags billed for were not real .

But remarkably, on the same day in August this year, both girls were told that donors had been found. The pair are now fighting fit, and are looking forward to Christmas with their families. Kirstie said: 'I couldn’t believe how lucky I had been to find another donor match but for Katie to get her wish too and on the same day - it was the best day of our lives.' Doctors told Kirstie that she was being transferred to a hospice after her first transplant from 2011 began failing.

They had both even planned their own funerals because they had become so unwell. Kirstie said: 'I didn’t want to make the situation any worse for my husband and family so I thought planning my funeral myself would help them.' The friends first met on social networking site Facebook through a CF communitysupport page. Katie said: 'I met Kirstie online and we instantly became friends as we had so much in common because of our condition. 'She is not only my best friend but an inspiration to many as her journey of survival is incredible. 'We never thought in a million years that we would both get a transplant on the same day.'

Despite her excitement, Kirstie had to keep the lung donor news to herself until doctors confirmed everything. Kirstie said: 'I wrote a status on Facebook that read ""I have an exciting secret but I can’t tell you what it is yet"" and Katie messaged me straight away to ask if it was lungs. Moving on: Kirstie and her husband, Stu, have just moved into their first house together - something they never thought would happen due to her ill health . 'I felt bad knowing that I was going to receive a second lung transplant when she hadn’t got her first match yet.' However, Katie, who was struggling to breathe so much so that she was on constant oxygen, also received a lifesaving call that day.

Recovered: Katie has now been able to return to school . Her mother, Angie Hart,46, said: 'It was such an emotional time, we were obviously all so relieved but at the same time really nervous as it’s such a big operation.' Luckily the operations went well and both girls are now looking forward to the future and Christmas. Katie said: 'I have been able to go back to school now which is great as I missed out on so much when my breathing got really bad.'

BBC chairman Lord Patten was under fire last night after blocking the release of a secret report on a disastrous £100 million IT project. Auditors are expected to release a devastating report this week on the BBC’s botched Digital Media Initiative (DMI), which was scrapped in May. A review by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) is expected to be sharply critical of the BBC’s management of the project, which was meant to digitise the BBC’s archives. Lord Patten has allegedly vetoed the release of the report under Freedom of Information laws, saying its publication would be likely to 'inhibit the free and frank provision of advice from BBC staff to senior managers' But is has also emerged that Lord Patten has frustrated attempts to get to the bottom of exactly how much the BBC’s senior management knew about the project. Minutes of a meeting of the BBC’s executive board in June 2011 show that the board discussed a report on the progress of the initiative. But the Guardian yesterday reported that Lord Patten has vetoed the release of the report under Freedom of Information laws, saying its publication would be likely to ‘inhibit the free and frank provision of advice from BBC staff to senior managers’. Criticism: Tory MP Rob Wilson said Lord Patten was making a . 'dreadful mistake' in trying to cover up the BBC's mistakes . Tory MP Rob Wilson last night said Lord Patten was making a ‘dreadful mistake’ in trying to cover up the BBC’s mistakes rather than opening them up to scrutiny. Mr Wilson said: ‘It is no surprise that a report from PWC criticises the BBC’s system of governance, as the past year’s events have shown there is very little real leadership and management taking place at the most senior levels. ‘Lord Patten is once again making the dreadful mistake of hiding the truth and failing to expose the BBC to any form of openness and transparency. One wonders how much more management failures the ordinary, hardworking and decent members of BBC staff can take.’ The . revelation comes just days after the Commons public accounts committee . warned that the BBC’s leadership system was ‘broken’. MPs accused the . BBC management of a ‘culture of cronyism’ in a damning report on the . huge pay-offs handed to senior figures. The . secret 2011 report on the DMI is potentially embarrassing for the BBC, . which did not finally abandon the initiative until May this year, when . it was scrapped by Lord Hall in one of his first acts as the . corporation’s new director-general. Lord Hall said the project had ‘wasted a huge amount of money’ - estimated at £98.4 million. At the time he said he had ‘serious concerns’ about the way the scheme had been managed.Whistleblowers have revealed that BBC bosses were told three years ago that the DMI initiative was heading for the rocks. Senior . managers were warned in 2010 that the projected £95 million benefits of . the scheme were ‘hugely optimistic and difficult to deliver’. Bill . Garrett, former head of technology in the BBC’s programme making . department, also wrote to Lord Patten also wrote to Lord Patten . personally in May 2012 to warn him of ‘serious concerns’ that costs were . spiralling out of control. The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was meant to allow BBC staff to access everything in the archive from their computers, doing away with the need for video or audio tapes . But despite the warnings, the project was allowed to continue for years, clocking up millions of pounds of waste. The DMI, which was dubbed ‘Don’t Mention It’ by BBC staff because of repeated problems, was meant to allow all footage to be recorded digitally, doing away with the need for video and audi tapes. But it proved so unreliable that traditional tape editing machines had to be installed at the BBC’s headquarters. The National Audit Office is expected to launch a fresh investigation into the affair following the release of the PWC report. The Commons public accounts committee is also expected to summon former BBC director-general Mark Thompson to explain why the corporation continued with the project for so long.","Review expected to be sharply critical of the BBC's management of project .

A six-year-old Indian girl who was locked in a room and raped is being forced to marry the eight-year-old son of her alleged attacker. The victim, who lives in the village of Keshavpura, in Rajasthan, was attacked by the 40-year-old around two weeks ago, it is claimed. Instead of going to police, her family complained to council elders who held a meeting to decide what should happen to the alleged rapist. The girl was raped in Keshavpura in the Kota district of Rajasthan (above), India . Astonishingly, they then told the girl's parents that their daughter must marry her attacker's eight-year-old son. Meanwhile, the girl is believed to have been raped by the same man again on Wednesday, according to NDTV. The victim's family has refused to accept the elders' decision. The case is the latest in a string of horrific sexual assaults on women and young girls in India, including a fatal attack on a 23-year-old medical student in Delhi late last year and the rape of a photojournalist in Mumbai last month. In the latest case in Keshavpura, which . is about 150 miles from the city of Jaipur, police only became involved . after social activists brought the victim and her parents to Mahaveer Nagar police station in Kota to file a . complaint.

Children of the 80s will remember the classic, and sometimes infuriating, childhood game of Screwball Scramble. It involved moving a pinball over an obstacle course of steps, swings and slides and remains popular today. But now a group of Lego enthusiasts have created an amazing modern-day version complete with escalators, robotic hands and even a pneumatic ramp. Scroll down for video . The Great Ball Contraption, pictured, was built by members of the Tsukuba Lego Circle in Japan. Each section is made from an individual 'module' with various motorised arms, scoops, lifts, escalators, robotic hands and corkscrews that transport the balls from one module to another . Each module should have an ‘in’ basket, and should move balls to the next module's ‘in’ basket. This basket should be at least 10 studs wide, by 10 studs long and high, with an 8x8 opening. The ‘in’ basket should be built onto the left-hand side of a module, and the output should go to the right. Each module should be able to accept balls at an average rate of 1 per second and balls can be passed one at a time, or in a batch of fewer than 30 balls. Called the Lego Great Ball Contraption, the mechanical device is said to contain around 11,000 bricks and is made up of modules submitted by various members of a Japanese Lego fan club. One of the largest stretches was built by 22-year-old Kawaguchi Akiyuki from Shimane. He built 17 of the modules using around 3,000 bricks. It took him almost 600 hours to build, and his modules include a ball factory followed by a zigzag stair and lift. A pneumatic ramp scoops the balls into a cup and the balls are then thrown towards a miniature basketball hoop. The action is so precise that the majority of the balls go through the hoop. A mechanical train then picks these balls up and moves them to a spiral lift before a mechanical plastic fork scoops the balls from the lift puts them onto a moving step. A belt conveyor then moves the balls to the next module. Other members who contributed to the construction include Fin, Makoto Uda, Toise, Matk, Momonga, Kosaku-jin, Katsumata and Yattaran also contributed modules.

A belt conveyor then moves the ball to the next module . The modern-day Lego GBC works in a similar way to the 1980s Tomy game Screwball Scramble, pictured . Akiyuki has been building with Lego since he was a child and said during a Blocumentary - a documentary series that interviews Lego fans on YouTube: ‘Since I was little I’ve always like watching Lego that move. I like the movements that look like robots.’ A great ball contraption or (GBC) is a machine which moves small balls from one module and passes them to another module. It is based on the Rube Goldberg machine, which is a contraption that performs a simple task in a complex way, usually involving a chain reaction of events to take place in order to perform this task. Lego enthusiasts around the world make GBC and there are even rules. For example, each module should have an ‘in’ basket, and should move balls to the next module's ‘in’ basket. This basket should be at least 10 studs wide, by 10 studs long and high, with an 8x8 opening.

Kawaguchi Akiyuki continued: ‘When you start building GBC it’s very hard to come up with your own original creation. I think you should start by copying other people’s modules. That way you can learn faster. You shouldn’t think about it too much, you should just start moving your hands and building. You will make mistakes but eventually you’ll get it to work.‘ .","The machine was built by members of the Tsukuba Lego Circle in Japan .

Exercise may hold the key to combatting some of the negative side effects that antidepressants can have on a woman’s sex drive. Just 30 minutes of exercise immediately before having sex, ‘significantly’ improves sexual functioning in women taking the drugs and boosts their ability to orgasm, new research suggests. The findings could have important health implications for alleviating some side effects of antidepressants. Exercise may hold the key to combatting some of the negative side effects that antidepressants can have on a woman's sex drive, according to new research by the University of Texas . The study, published online in the journal Depression and Anxiety, shows that sexual dysfunction can be effectively treated with an inexpensive, non-invasive prescription of moderately intense workouts. ‘These findings have important implications for public health, as exercise as a treatment for sexual side effects is accessible, cheap and does not add to burden of care,’ said Tierney Lorenz, an Indiana University post-doctoral research fellow, who conducted the study at the University of Texas at Austin with psychology professor Cindy Meston. The researchers examined 52 women who reported sexual side effects from antidepressants. The study participants had sex without doing an exercise for the first three weeks of the experiment. Over another three weeks, half of the group then exercised for 30 minutes immediately before having sex and the other half did 30 minutes of strength training and cardio exercise three times a week whenever they liked. The two groups then reversed roles in the last experiment. The scientists discovered that regular exercise improved the ability of the women to orgasm. They also found that those who exercised immediately before sex experienced significantly stronger libidos and overall improvements in sexual functioning . Women who exercised regularly were asked to add three extra sessions to their workout routines and all the participants self-reported their sexual function, desires, satisfaction and psychological health before and after each part of the experiment. The scientists discovered that regular exercise improved the ability of the women to orgasm. They also found that those who exercised immediately before sex experienced significantly stronger libidos and overall improvements in sexual functioning. The researchers believe this is because moderately intense exercise activates the sympathetic nervous system, which facilitates blood flow to the genital region, while antidepressants have been shown to decrease this system. Scheduling regular sexual activity and exercise may be an effective tool for alleviating these adverse side effects, Dr Lorenz said. ‘Considering the wide prevalence of antidepressant sexual side effects and the dearth of treatment options for those experiencing these distressing effects, this is an important step in treating sexual dysfunction among women who are taking antidepressants,’ she said.

Suspect: James Smith, 41, has been charged with attempted murder, kidnapping and sexual battery in the abduction of two young brothers . A Mississippi man has abducted two young brothers, took them to his trailer, where he sexually assaulted both children and slashed the throat of the older boy, police said. James Harold Smith, 41, has been charged with attempted murder, kidnapping, sexual battery on a child and resisting arrest. He is being held on $3.5million bond. The 8-year-old boy is hospitalized and is expected to survive the Wednesday attack, said Don Bass, chief deputy with Hancock County sheriff's office on the Mississippi coast. Bass said the older brother, with his throat cut, escaped the suspect's trailer Wednesday evening and ran about 500 yards to a neighbor's house. The neighbor called police. The children were abducted Wednesday afternoon from a residence in Pearl River County and taken to the trailer in rural Hancock County where Smithy sexually abused the 8-year-old and his 5-year-old brother, Hancock County Sheriff Ricky Adam said in a news release. Smith was released from prison to house arrest in June after serving only a few months of a lengthy sentence in a racketeering case involving methamphetamine and assaulting a police officer, according to corrections officials and court records. Shane Tucker, chief deputy with Pearl River County sheriff's department, said Smith is a cousin of the boys' father's live-in girlfriend. Crime scene: The camper trailer in Leetown where Smith allegedly took two boys after kidnapping them from Pearl River County . He said Smith had not been around the boys much, but was familiar with them, and lured them away while they played in the yard of their caretaker's home. After the older child escaped Smith's trailer located off Mitchell Road in Leetown, Bass said Smith grabbed the younger boy, put him in a car and was trying to get away when Hancock County sheriff's deputy Tommy Bethea spotted them and blocked the car's path. The suspect jumped out of his car and Bethea was able to rescue the 5-year-old, Bass said. Survivor: An 8-year-old boy had his throat slashed, but managed to walk 500 yards to a neighbor's home and ask for help . Sheriff's dispatchers got a call just before 5.30pm about a bleeding boy who showed up at a home on Mitchell Road and said someone had tried to kill him, The Sun Herald reported. Authorities said the older boy's escape and the information provided by his brother were instrumental in their survival and the case against the suspect. ‘Those boys did an amazing job,’ Tucker said. Bass said Smith tried to get away by running through thick woods but was caught about 8pm a few miles away on a highway. Smith hurt himself somehow in the woods and was treated for injuries, Bass said. The 8-year-old was airlifted to USA Medical Center in Mobile, Alabama, and was in stable condition Thursday, Adam said. According to officials, the child’s husky built may have saved his life . Smith has a lengthy criminal record. Tara Booth, a spokeswoman with the Mississippi Department of Corrections, said Smith was sentenced to more than four years in 2006 for receiving stolen property. His probation was revoked in January 2011 for failure to report and pay fines, and he was sentenced to more than two years.

"By . Robert Verkaik . and Sharon Churcher . PUBLISHED: . 20:36 EST, 5 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:06 EST, 5 January 2013 . A tycoon accused of hiding a multi-million-pound fortune from his former wife in an acrimonious divorce battle has been sentenced to two years in jail. Lawyers say the prison term, the longest of its kind, will serve as a stark warning to husbands who defy the courts in an effort to stop their ex-partners sharing their riches. The man at the centre of the case is David Thursfield, a 67-year-old cigar-chomping former boss at the Ford motor company. He was nicknamed Darth Vader by colleagues for his role in closing Ford’s Dagenham factory in 2002. Tycoon: David Thursfield, pictured with his third wife Rachel, was sentenced to two years in jail for hiding his fortune during a divorce row . His fearsome reputation for cost-cutting helped him earn a salary of up to £1.2 million a year and a jet-set lifestyle which included the use of a string of luxury properties in exotic locations around the world. But he is now a wanted man after a High Court judge sentenced him in his absence to two years’ jail  for ‘a continuing failure’ to disclose his alleged hidden wealth in a case which his ex-wife of 27 years brought against him. Last night Mr Thursfield’s ex-wife Linda, 61, a British-born dental  surgeon, blamed the break-up of the marriage on her husband’s interest in Rachel Measures, 40, whom he married after their divorce settlement was finalised in 2005. Speaking from her home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, she said: ‘I’d moved all over the world with David and I’d given up my profession for him. It was like I’d passed my expiration date and he was trading me in for a younger model.’ The Thursfields met when he  was a plant manager with British  Leyland in the Midlands in the  Seventies. The couple married in Birmingham and during his career he landed top jobs in Australia, Spain, Essex, Germany and the US. Linda Thursfield, 61, blamed her marriage break-up on her husband's interest in Rachel Measures, 40 . Mrs Thursfield filed for divorce in the US while her husband was based at Ford’s Detroit headquarters. In 2005 she agreed a cash settlement of £1.1 million and their heavily mortgaged mansion in a Detroit suburb. Mr Thursfield was awarded a grand property named Prospect House in Cheltenham, which he has since sold for £1.6 million. After the settlement Mrs Thursfield hired private detectives and a forensic accountant to track her husband’s alleged wealth to a bank account in Switzerland and a family trust fund which, allegedly, is being used to control his fortune for the benefit of his third and latest wife. In 2011, Mrs Thursfield took her case to the High Court where she successfully obtained a freezing order against her husband – to stop him disposing of his property or money. She was entitled to sue in this country because the High Court agreed there was sufficient relationship between Mr Thursfield and his assets and British jurisdiction. Mr Thursfield was deemed to have breached the High Court judge’s order to disclose details of his alleged wealth. In the legal proceedings it was claimed that he had recently been given £3.5 million in payments  from one of his former employers, Cerberus Capital Management, a New York private equity firm. Mrs Thursfield’s investigators said that he also bought a £1.5 million property in an exclusive Bahamas harbour-front development called the Ocean Club – where scenes from the James Bond movie Casino Royale were filmed. But Mr Thursfield told the court he was now ‘virtually penniless’ and said the £31,000 cost of his third wedding and £118,000 in school and university fees for the daughter he had with Linda had contributed to his fall from riches to rags. He also claimed the running costs of the property in the Bahamas between 2005 and 2010 were £200,000. Asset: The house in Cheltenham the tycoon kept in the settlement . According to the High Court judgment, when he was asked in 2009 by a Michigan court about reasons for ‘strange dealings’ with a £2.5 million loan deposited into a Swiss bank account, he said: ‘Because I did not want to be encumbered by you people and constrained on what I do with any of the money that I earned or borrowed. It becomes tiresome when you meddle in my affairs.’ High Court Judge Charles Purle QC ruled that Mr Thursfield ‘deliberately refused to say what had happened’ to the £3.5 million from Cerberus. The judge added that ‘millions of dollars appears to have vanished  . . .  I am satisfied that the husband is deliberately refusing to reveal what happened to it.’ Ruling that Mr Thursfield was in contempt of court, the judge said he was imposing a punitive sentence ‘as a coercive measure in order to encourage full and prompt compliance hereafter’. Last night Amanda McAlister, a family law expert at international law firm Slater & Gordon, said: ‘This judgment undoubtedly will send shivers up the spine of husbands  and wives whose strategy is to  hide assets.’ Last night a spokesman for Mr Thursfield said: ‘David is appealing [against the prison sentence] and maintains that the original settlement was more than adequate.’","David Thursfield, 67, is a wanted man after a High Court .

"By . David Williams . and Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 03:28 EST, 29 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:42 EST, 30 May 2013 . Britain was embroiled in a costly legal farce last night over the fate of up to 90 Taliban detainees suspected of trying to kill UK troops. Lawyers for the Afghans – given a huge platform yesterday by the BBC – claimed the prisoners are being illegally detained at a ‘secret’ prison within Camp Bastion in Helmand Province and demanded they be brought before a court or released. But when Defence Secretary Philip Hammond indicated that the military was prepared to release them to the Afghan authorities, the same lawyers – funded by legal aid – said they might launch fresh action in the UK courts to prevent that happening. Held without trial: A Chinook helicopter flies out of Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, where up to 90 inmates are being held, it was revealed today . Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, pictured left in Downing Street, has defended Britain's policy of holding Afghan nationals at Camp Bastion while human rights lawyer Phil Shiner (right), the lawyer representing inmates has claimed it is unlawful and amounts to internment . They claim handing the prisoners over . to the Afghan police would place them in danger of being tortured, and . therefore infringe their human rights. To add to the confusion, the Afghan . defence ministry is now demanding the detainees be delivered to be dealt . with ‘according to our judicial laws’. The case had been presented on the BBC’s flagship Today programme as the scandal of Britain’s Guantanamo Bay. But last night it appeared more fiasco than scandal. Until last year, British forces in . Afghanistan were allowed to detain suspects for a maximum of 96 hours . except in ‘exceptional cases’ before handing them over to be dealt with . by the Afghan authorities. But in 2010 the High Court ordered . that detainees should not be released into the hands of the Afghans . because of concerns over torture. Military vehicles sit in a compound in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, awaiting redeployment to the UK after returning from the battlefield . In training: Camp Bastion is also used as a training ground for Afghan forces . So the only alternative to detention . now is the release of prisoners into the local Afghan community, with . the clear risk they would soon be launching fresh attacks on British . troops. Yesterday it was revealed that up to . 90 Afghans are being held at Bastion, including a teenager who has been . in custody for 14 months, without trial or access to lawyers in what . British human rights lawyer Phil Shiner said was a breach of . international law. But Mr Hammond hit back, dismissing . the claim of a secret jail as ‘patently absurd’ and warning that the . release of the men – arrested by British soldiers in raids in Helmand . and Kandahar provinces and believed to be responsible for the killing . and wounding of troops – would put the UK military at risk. An armoured vehicle passes a watchtower at Bastion Airfield at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province, Afghanistan . He said: ‘These are people suspected . of murdering British troops by facilitating or planting or being . involved with IEDs (improvised explosive devices) at a time when most . people are focused on how we protect our troops from being murdered, . whether it’s on the streets of London or on the battlefield.’ Mr Hammond said Britain had been . working with the Afghans to establish a ‘safe pathway’ for the transfer . of the detainees and pointed out the legal proceedings were at ‘the . expense, of course, of the British taxpayer’ because they are funded by . the legal aid system. ‘We want nothing more than to be able to hand these people over,’ he said. And last night the Ministry of Defence said it had found a ‘safe route’ to hand over the prisoners. But Mr Shiner, of Public Interest . Lawyers, representing some of those involved in the court action, . claimed the Government was failing to deal with the suspects ‘humanely’ and according to international law. ‘The UK could have trained the Afghan . authorities to detain people lawfully with proper standards and making . sure that they are treated humanely,’ he said. ‘They could have monitored that, . including inspections to make sure  the Afghans were obeying the law. They have chosen not to do so.’ Richard Stein from law firm Leigh Day, . who is representing one of the detainees, said: ‘We have been asking . for access to our client since March and, to date, it has still not been . provided.’ Last night General Zahir Azimi, a . spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defence, demanded: ‘The prisoners . must be handed over to the Afghan authorities. ‘They will be dealt with according to our laws, and agreements reached with the international community.’ However the lawyers may take more court action to prevent the men being handed over. Crusading: The Guantanamo comparison was made by lawyer Phil Shiner, pictured, a long-time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan . Listeners to BBC radio were assured . that it was a scandal to compare with Guantanamo Bay and the American . detention of terror suspects without time limit and without trial. Breathlessly, . reporters revealed that they had been given documents showing 85 . Afghans were in a British holding camp near Kabul. This might amount to . unlawful detention and internment, they said. A . little later a familiar name appeared in the BBC reports. The . Guantanamo comparison was made by crusading lawyer Phil Shiner, a . long-time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in Iraq and . Afghanistan. Indeed, it was . Mr Shiner who led the case that ended with a 2010 High Court block on . the transfer of detainees from Camp Bastion to the Afghan authorities, . which compelled the British military to keep so many prisoners in . detention in the first place. In . January 2010 he wrote on the Guardian’s website: ‘My firm’s next case . focuses on the UK’s detention policy in Afghanistan, where we routinely . hand over Afghans to the Afghan authorities in full knowledge of the . torture, summary executions and disappearances occurring within their . facilities.’ Mr . Shiner, 56, was a Birmingham University graduate who became an articled . clerk and then a solicitor in the city. He worked for a decade for legal . firms, a council estate project, a law centre and the Barnardo’s . charity before founding his own firm in 1999. The . father of five is also a visiting professor at London Metropolitan . University, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, and was . awarded the title ‘Human Rights Lawyer of the Year’ in 2004. He has repeatedly denied that he is an ‘ambulance chaser’ and calls the idea that he trawls for work‘ laughable’. His . firm, Public Interest Lawyers, made its name in Iraq, where Mr Shiner . represented alleged victims of abuses by British troops, including . relatives of Baha Mousa, who died in 2003 in British custody. Nearly £3million has been paid in compensation to the family of Mr Mousa and other men. Mr Shiner sent a representative to Iraq to find and interview people . who claimed to have been harmed by the British, and their claims were . brought to the British courts. Public . Interest Lawyers says it is currently acting for more than 130 former . detainees who allege that they or their family members were unlawfully . detained, ill-treated, or killed by UK forces in Iraq. Controversial: The detention facility at Camp Bastion, where the BBC said up to 90 Afghans are held . The firm’s interests are, . however, not exclusively abroad. It says its mission is ‘helping . individuals like you challenge the unlawful behaviour of those who . govern us both nationally and locally’. Its . most recent highly-publicised domestic case was last month when it . represented a campaign group who objected to the use of unpaid workers . in Surrey libraries on the grounds they had not received equality . training. It won the case . and the county council was barred by a High Court judge from using . volunteers to work in its libraries. This was, said Mr Shiner, a . ‘fantastic result’. The libraries are now threatened with closure.","Eight of the inmates have been held for as long as 14 months .

A village dog show has been scrapped after fighting broke out between competitors who acted like 'football hooligans'. The annual dog-grooming competition began as an event for families in sleepy Higham, in Kent, five years ago and has grown in popularity. Organisers expecting a record 700 dogs for this year's event found themselves overwhelmed by a crowd of nearly 2,000. Trouble started at this year's dog show in the village of Higham, in Kent, after visitors struggled to find room to park . The annual dog-grooming competition began as an event for families five years ago and has grown in popularity . An 18-year-old volunteer was allegedly hit by an angry motorist and a cyclist because of the queueing traffic. Little Lexie is pictured, right, at this year's Higham Memorial Hall Field dog show . The huge numbers put pressure on facilities at the village's Memorial Hall playing fields and trouble erupted when visitors struggled to find room to park. One motorist got so angry at queueing traffic he allegedly punched an 18-year-old volunteer. A cyclist is also said to have hit the volunteer because traffic was blocking up the street. The bad feeling spilled over to dog owners who apparently turned on event organisers complaining their pets had not won a rosette and demanded compensation. Two women rivals allegedly started fighing and rubbish and verbal abuse was thrown at show organisers. It was also claimed football fans turned up without dogs looking for a showdown with rival supporters. Police were called to resolve the parking disputes and angry pet owners were sent home without compensation. The huge numbers put pressure on facilities at the village's Memorial Hall playing fields . Event founder Rachel Hodges, 49, said she was so saddened by the ugly scenes she was cancelling the event for good. The former Crufts-winning owner said: 'We're not doing it next year. 'I had rubbish thrown at me and I had abuse thrown at me. Girls in the tent who were taking donations were reduced to tears. 'We had to separate two women who started scrapping. I couldn't believe it. We are just a village dog show. People arrive for the Higham Memorial Hall Field dog show in Kent . 'My husband and niece were also verbally abused by people who were not winning in the show. 'They were like football hooligans. One of them turned up just to cause trouble. It was frightening. 'Somebody told me after the show that there actually were football fans coming across from London just on the off chance that fans from a rival team might be there. 'People were storming up to the volunteers and demanding they get Â£20 compensation because we had ruined their bank holiday. Event founder Rachel Hodges said the event has now been cancelled as she 'can't put my family and friends at risk' 'It was a free event and all proceeds went to charities. We were giving money to Help for Heroes for that poor soldier and people were demanding we give them compensation. 'If we did it again we'd probably need a security team and so we decided to just stop. I can't put my family and friends at risk. It's just sad that people want to do this.' Parking and entry was free to the show on Bank Holiday Monday which featured Mugly the world's ugliest dog. Police said they attended the show but only had one call, complaining about the number of people parked near the venue making it difficult to drive through the village.","Trouble started at dog show when visitors struggled to find room to park .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:18 EST, 21 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:47 EST, 21 December 2013 . Web investor Tim Draper has a grand vision to divide California into six new states, freeing Silicon Valley from the rest of the Golden State. The plan, which would need government approval, is to split the state into six smaller ones: Jefferson, North California, Central California, West California, South California, and Silicon Valley. Each new state would have its own government and elected officials, meaning the enclave of Silicon Valley would be free to achieve its techno utopia dreams. Golden age: Tim Draper wants to divide California into six smaller states . As outrageous as it sounds, the plan has backing from Chuck Reed, the mayor of Silicon Valley's largest city - San Jose. The venture capitalist told NBC Bay Area: 'It's absolutely appealing to cut ourselves off from the drag of the rest of California.' While the idea may appeal to many of California's 38 million residents, if the six-state plan were approved it would come down to government and not voters. 'Getting such a measure on California's . wacky ballot will be no easy task ... attempts to get initiatives on . the state ballot can cost millions of dollars, and often fail,' Gawker reported TechCrunch as saying. His plan was met with a mixed reaction on Twitter, with Nuzzel founder Jonathan Abrams tweeting: 'Tim Draper has idea even sillier than moon colony or seasteading.' Josh Elman, who has worked at various web companies such as Twitter and Facebook, tweeted that the plan reminded him of Ecotopia, a novel set in an ecologically sound future. And Bram Cohen of BitTorrent tweeted: 'Is Tim Draper just engaging in performance art or is he just delusional?' Co-founder of CentUp Len Kendall imagined what the resulting 'utopia' would look like, tweeting: 'AND THEN teenagers from the various territories will fight to the death in a closed arena to win health benefits.' The proposal has a long way to go, although raising the funds for such a campaign would not be problematic for Mr Draper, who just stepped down from his billionaire partnership at Draper Fisher Jurvetson, which backed more than 500 start ups including Hotmail, Skype and Telsa electric sports cars. Innovative: Venture capitalist Tim Draper says the plan will mean Californians have better representation . Dividing lines: If the plan wins approval, Silicon Valley will become a separate state . In an email to TechCrunch he said the reason for dividing the state up was so its large population had more appropriate representation in Washington. He added that this would mean decisions being made by government would be more relevant to the population. ''This initiative encourages more competition and less monopolistic power,' he said. 'Like all competitive systems, costs will be lower and service will be better.' The man behind other ground-breaking initiatives such as Draper University in San Mateo, added: 'Each new state can start fresh. From a new crowd-sourced state flower to a more relevant constitution.' Mr Draper added that Californias had been backing the idea of a divide since 1859, when 'Voters overwhelmingly approved the splitting of California into two states ... but Congress never acted on that request.'","Tim Draper puts forward vision to create smaller states with better representation .

The UK is evacuating Britons from South Sudan today after 500 people were killed in a suspected coup attempt. The Foreign Office says it has been contacted by 150 British nationals who need help leaving the African nation following fighting on the streets of the capital Juba. A spokeswoman said: 'A UK aircraft is en route to Juba to evacuate British nationals who wish to leave from Juba airport on Thursday 19 December. Scroll down for video . The UK is airlifting Britons out of South Sudan today after an armed coup attempted to force President Salva Kiir (pictured) from power . 'If you are a British national and you wish to leave Juba you should contact the FCO as soon as possible.' President Salva Kiir has declared a night time curfew in the city and accuses ex-Vice President Riek Machar of trying to oust him from power. The British embassy in South Sudan will remain open, but a spokesman said the situation is under 'constant review' while the Foreign Office is also advising against all travel to Juba, Jonglei State and South Sudan's border with Sudan; and against all but essential travel to the rest of the country. According to the UN around 20,000 civilians have so far taken refuge in its camps around the city to escape the fighting. Machar was fired along with the entire South Sudan cabinet back in July after announcing he would contest the 2015 general election. Since the clashes began ten ex-government ministers have been arrested, with the exception of Machar, who is now though to be in hiding. Machar denies using troop loyal to his cause to try and stage a coup, saying the fighting is due to a misunderstanding between presidential guards. French UN ambassador Gerard Araud has warned that the conflict has the potential to turn into a civil war between ethnic groups because Kiir is from the minority Dinka population, while Machar is a Nuer. Following UN calls for an end to the violence, Kiir has said he is willing to enter talks with Machar, but says he is unsure what the outcome will be. The conflict began on Sunday when President Kiir accused uniformed soldiers of opening fire at a government meeting. After sporadic fighting Kiir appeared on television to announce the government was back in control and to impose the curfew, but since then clashes have continued and the conflict is now entering its third day. Since becoming an independent nation in . 2011, South Sudan has struggled to establish a stable government, and . there are many active armed groups across the country. Government tanks have taken to the streets in order to regain control and President Kiir has imposed a curfew . Fighting began on Sunday after troops loyal to ex-Vice President Riek Machar allegedly opened fire at a government meeting. Clashes have continued ever since leaving 500 dead and 20,000 seeking shelter in UN camps (file picture) After declaring independence South Sudan became Africa's third most oil-rich country, after Nigeria and Angola, taking two thirds of Sudan's oil reserves. In 2012 a dispute with Sudan over oil lead to a 15-month halt in production which cut the country's economy in half. So far there is no indication that oil production has been affected by the latest clashes.

Figure skater Brian Boitano announced that he is homosexual in a statement released today in response to his inclusion on the presidential delegation to Sochi, where Russia’s anti-gay propaganda laws will be in effect. ‘I am many things: a son, a brother and uncle, an athlete, a cook, an author and being gay is just one part of who I am,’ the 1988 Olympic gold medalist wrote. Back on the ice: Brian Boitano, seen here at an event on December 11, won a gold medal in the 1988 Calgary games and today he came out as gay . ‘First and foremost I am an American athlete and I am proud to live in a country that encourages diversity, openness and tolerance. I hope we can remain focused on the Olympic spirit which celebrates achievement in sport by peoples of all nations.’ In addition to his gold medal from the Calgary Olympics in 1988, he also came in sixth place in the 1994 games and is a two time World Champion. He had never addressed his personal life before today, but felt compelled to do so in light of the Sochi Games. ‘It has been my experience from competing around the world and in Russia that Olympic athletes can come together in friendship, peace and mutual respect regardless of their individual country’s practices,’ he wrote. Then and now: Boitano's career high was the gold medal win in 1988 (left) but also won two World Championships and a sixth place distinction in the 1994 games . Boitano will be one of three openly gay athletes who will be traveling to Russia as part of the delegation, which President Obama is sending in his place as neither he nor Michelle or Vice President Joe Biden will be attending. This is the first time since 2000 that the U.S. will not send a president, former president, first lady or vice president to the Games. France and Germany are among the other countries who will not send their presidents to Sochi for the Games. The other two openly gay athletes who will be a part of the American delegation are tennis star Billie Jean King, who President Obama awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009, and hockey player Caitlin Cahow. Ms King, who said she was ‘deeply honored’ to be included, will be attending the opening ceremonies while Ms Cahow will attend the closing ceremony.

It's those flyaway hemlines worn on windy airport runways Kate should be most concerned about. Now the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite dressmaker, London's Jenny Packham - the woman behind the infamously feather-light  yellow frock that almost cost the elder Middleton sister her modesty at Calgary Airport - has revealed she'll be weighting down the royal hemline from now on. Kate wore a specially designed Jenny Packham primrose yellow shift dress during her tour of Canada, and had a slight wardrobe malfunction on the windy runway at Calgary Airport. 'I had a little handwritten letter from a lady in Wisconsin passionately criticising me for the primrose yellow shift dress I made for the duchess,' Packham, who was born in Southampton, told London's Evening Standard. 'She said didn't I know about putting weights around the bottom of a hem so it can't blow up? 'Well, I didn't know it was going to be worn on a windy runway - but I did think maybe in future I will put in more weighting, just in case...' The Duchess suffered a similar sartorial slip-up on the runway at Brisbane airport as she and her husband Prince William were returning home from their Diamond Jubilee tour of the Far East and South Pacific. This time she was wearing not a Packham creation but a floral dress by Project D, the label of Danni Minogue and Tabitha Somerwet Webb. Queen Elizabeth takes tailored measures to ensure her skirt always knows its place. Perhaps Kate would benefit from the sage advice of her grandmother-in-law. Queen Elizabeth herself is reported . to be a fan of having tiny lead weights sewn into the hemlines of her . skirts and dresses to save her from embarrassment of this type. The monarch also ensures all her . dresses and skirts are made made with underskirts of a tighter . circumference than normal. That way there is no chance of them lifting above . knee-height. Similarly, to stop her getting too warm when she is on official business, the Queen insists on loose clothing. All her clothes are made of natural fibres, and Angela Kelly, her personal assistant and curator of the royal wardrobe, ensures that a duplicate for every outfit is close to hand. That way. if something is spilled on her clothes or there is any other mishap, Her Majesty can discreetly change into a new set without anyone knowing. No item of the Queen's wardrobe is sent to a dry cleaner — all clothes are hand-washed, steamed and pressed by one of her three dressers to avoid any unpleasant chemical smells. Kate wore Jenny Packham's duck-egg blue pleated dress in Malaysia, left, and Singapore, right, during the Diamond Jubilee tour. Back in London, Packham's flagship boutique is on the site of a former bank in Mayfair. Indeed, the private dressing room - where clients such as the Duchess of Cambridge and Hollywood actresses including  Kate Winslet, Elizabeth Hurley and Angelina Jolie are presented with their bespoke clothes - is a windowless room inside a former vault. The place is full of scented candles, flowers and zebra-print furniture. Kate wearing two Jenny Packham gowns to events in London alongside her husband, Prince William. Packham - who also designed the emerald green floor-length dress the Duchess wore to the Olympic concert at the Royal Albert Hall, two of the dresses she wore on her recent Jubilee tour in Singapore, and a pale grey floral summer dress worn in Los Angeles last year - does not sell the designs she has made for the young royal. Each and every one of them are bespoke, designed for Kate alone. 'We're not Reiss,' said Packham, who admits she is not high fashion and doesn't 'feel the need to be quirky or avant garde'. Still, business has gone up by 40 per cent in the past 18 months thank to the 'Duchess effect'. And anyone who does wish to buy one of Packham's non-bespoke, off-the-rack creations must be prepared to part with anything from £2,000 to £3,000.

During one episode, the pair were shown embracing on screen before sharing a glass of wine together, while Miss Grillo tasted ice cream made by Miss Lawson. Team Cupcake: Lisa Grillo was pictured on Nigella Lawson's BBC series in 2007 where they shared wine . Miss Grillo first began working as an au pair and nanny for Miss Lawson’s children around 16 years ago and her sister Francesca was recruited as a housekeeper by Charles Saatchi in 2001. During the trial, the television cook told how her team of assistants was nicknamed ‘Team Cupcake’, a titled dreamed up in 2010. She even explained how she regarded the Grillo sisters as ‘family’ and how the group had a feeling of sisterhood. She said she had ‘loved’ Lisa, and had regularly confided in her. She was happy to treat her to thousands of pounds worth of dental treatment and personal gifts, and allow her access to her family doctor. Miss Lawson had become emotional when telling the trial how Lisa had been ‘a stalwart and helped me through a very difficult time when my first husband was ill and died’. ‘She was a rock,’ she said. ‘I would have done anything for her.’ Hugs: The pair were close on- and off-screen after they met when Lisa was hired as Miss Lawson's au pair .

A visibly exhausted President Obama was pictured boarding Marine One with his daughters Malia and Sasha Friday night as the first family left Washington, DC for Hawaii. Every year the Obama family spends Christmas in the president's home state, where he recharges with shaved ice, football on the beach and a few holes of golf. Like many of us, Mr Obama already seemed in a vacation state-of-mind when he gave his last press conference of the year earlier in the day. 'You know, the end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see what can you do better next year,' Mr Obama told reporters. 'That's how I intend to approach it. I am sure that I will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun.' Scroll down for video .

This . will be the first family's sixth Christmas in Hawaii since he was . elected president, and in keeping with tradition they are expected to . spend their 17-day vacation in the Oahu neighborhood of Kailua. The . White House announced last week that the Obamas would depart  on December 21, since it was expected to be a light work schedule for the president in . Washington. The first family are spending their sixth Christmas in a row in Hawaii which will cost taxpayers $100,000 . The president and his family traditionally spend their Christmas break in a rented private beach front residence with spectacular ocean views. The Obamas cover the cost of the accommodation that typically costs up to $3,500 a day, or $75,000 a month, but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill which costs in the region of $1 million. For his first three years in office, the Obamas rented a $24,500-per-week gated Plantation Estate, which offered security and privacy on the white sand beach of Kailua Bay. Since then the Obamas have rented a few different houses on Kailuana Place, which has provoked different opinions from those who live in the area. Christmas traditions: The Obama will surely stop by Island Snow in Kailua for some shaved ice . The Obama's will cover the cost of their accommodation, but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill . 'It's exciting. It's really an honor to have him here, and when he's around â€“ actually the place is super safe because we have all this security around,â€™ Lanette Hayashi, who lives locally, told Hawaii News Now. 'We go through two security points and so the second one, we have to get out of our car.  We have to be searched ourselves, plus our car has to be completely searched,' said a woman called Madeline, who has lived on the street for more than four decades. When the President visits, the canal running through the Kailuana Street neighborhood is off limits and is patrolled by Navy seals and a Coast Guard cutter is positioned in the bay. It is one of the many security measures put in place, including military blockades on the beach and security checkpoints along the street where he stays.

'I understand he's the President and so he needs his security, but I'd like for him to pick next year another spot. This would be really nice,' said Madeline. 'At first it was exciting, but now it's no longer exciting.  It's maddening.' Last year, Obama was forced to cut short his vacation and fly back to Washington on the day after Christmas to resume negotiations on an emergency budget deal with Congress. This year, Congress is on track to approve a two-year budget deal before the Christmas holiday and so he isn't scheduled to return to Washington D.C. until January 5.","The first family left Washington tonight for their annual Christmas trip to Hawaii .

The Winter Solstice is the moment when the sun reaches its most southern point, after which days get longer again. It creates an alignment at neolithic sites around the world, including Stone Henge, Newgrange in Ireland, and Cerro del Gentil pyramid in Peru. Neo-druids, neo-pagans, and Wiccans - a variation on paganism - gather to chant spiritual mantras and bless the sun. This year, the chief druid blessed a baby, which is a great honour for druids. Many of our traditional Christmas tokens, including the Yule log, mistletoe, and decorating Christmas trees, started as Winter Solstice rituals. The head of a Neolithic man was even created to mark the biggest capital project English Heritage has ever undertaken. But it sparked a row with the druids, as the bones on which the model was based are now displayed for context. In protest against the new visitor site, Chief Druid Arthur Pendragon, who claims to be a reincarnation of King Arthur, led a counter celebration on the other side of the monument. Their prayers and chants coincided with a protest, as druids held up signs and banged on drums urging tourists to boycott the site. Mr Pendragon said: 'The Winter Solstice was incredibly over-managed this year. The situation with parking was awful and everyone was herded like sheep. 'People were asked to leave before midday, when in previous years they have stayed at the Solstice until well after 5pm. 'I got the impression that English Heritage wanted worshippers out of there as quickly as possible because they thought they got in the way of tourists. 'I'm sad to say that it was an utter shambles.' Chants of 'rebury the dead' and 'grave robbers' were shouted at the visitor centre by the group, while tourists were told 'don't pay, go away'. As dawn approached, Mr Pendragon produced a bouquet of flowers before a woman who held mistletoe over it, chanting. Ian Temple, arch druid of Dorset, dressed as the green man for the event.

A man once employed by the real Wolf of Wall Street has revealed just what working at the dodgy Long Island firm Stratton Oakmont described in the film was like. Josh Shapiro, 41, found himself caught up in the 1990s in a life of Quaaludes, prostitutes, and fooling investors under the guidance of infamous brokers Jordan Belfort and Danny Porush. Now Shaprio has revealed to the New York Post that working for the men fictionalized by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill was a nightmare and that the snake oil salesmen have gotten off way too easy for their shady ways. ‘These people were some of the worst people that I have ever met in my life,’ Shapiro told the Post. Shapiro . arrived home to Long Island from the Marines in 1993 and soon got a job . at Stratton Oakmont after his physician father suggested he enter the . business co-owned by his partner’s son, Danny Porush. ‘I was a little hesitant at first. I had no interest in stock brokerage. I didn’t know anything about it,’ he told the Post. Porush is fictionalized in the film as Donny Azoff, played by Jonah Hill. When Danny Porush told him he could make $100,000 per month, Shapiro leaped onboard. ‘I was blown away by the intensity,’ he said. ‘You could feel the pulse when you walked into the place.’ Soon, he realized that pulse was fueled with rampant drug use, among other vices.

Daniel Hall, 50, said that his disgraced father's charity work should 'not be whitewashed' because of his court admission. Lawyer Daniel, his sister Francesca, 52, and their mother Hazel, 72, are standing by the broadcaster who confessed that he indecently assaulted 13 children over an 18 year period. He told the Daily Express: 'It does not change my relationship with my dad - he's been a superb father and grandfather. 'My father's massive work for charity for 50 years, for which he was awarded an OBE, and a lifetime of good work should not be whitewashed in one brushstroke. 'That would not be fair.' Former It's a Knockout presenter Hall and his family were leading fundraisers in the North-West. MPs signed a motion in the House of Commons in 1999 congratulating Hall on four decades in broadcasting. He was awarded the OBE just last year for his services to television and charity. Hall was described as an 'opportunist predator' by the Crown Prosecution Service after it was revealed on Thursday that the 83-year-old pleaded guilty to carrying out the attacks between 1968 and 1986 when he appeared before a judge at Preston Crown Court. He had fiercely denied all the allegations and read out a strident condemnation to reporters in which he labelled the claims as 'pernicious, callous, cruel and above all spurious' after he was charged last year. The former sports commentator said he had endured 'a living nightmare' and but for his 'very loving family' may have considered taking his own life. Loyal: Daniel and Stuart Hall pictured together in the 1990s . But when he appeared before a judge on April 16, he calmly and repeatedly answered 'guilty' when the charges were put to him.

Since his guilty admission was revealed, it has been claimed that BBC managers turned a blind eye to Stuart Hall’s regular practice of luring young girls into his dressing room. The BBC said it would not be setting up a separate inquiry into the Hall case and neither would it be setting up a hotline for allegations about the presenter. But the broadcaster confirmed it would be forwarding ‘some information about Stuart Hall’ onto the Dame Janet Smith review.

There are 120,000 applications available for Windows Phone, but some apps that are popular on other systems are notably missing from Windows Phone because it can be hard to get developers interested in writing programs for a small number of smartphones.

Actress Jessica Alba smiles on stage during the Microsoft Windows Phone 8 event at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium on October 29 . The firm has signed up major operators around the world for the handsets. Verizon executives in the US have said that they want to see a viable 'third ecosystem' alongside Apple's iPhone and Google's Android. Having more potential partners to work with provides the carriers with more leverage against each one and would make them less dependent on the whims of Apple and Google. Microsoft released Windows 8 for desktops, laptops and tablets last week. That event was devoid of surprises, as Microsoft needed to work with hundreds of partners such as computer makers ahead of time. With smartphone software, the number of partners is much smaller, so Microsoft was able to save some details for Monday's launch event. For example, Belfiore revealed that Windows Phone 8 will come with a 'Kid's Corner' feature. If enabled, kids will be able to start up the phone from the lock screen, gaining access to apps and games that the phone's owner has designated as safe for them. Belfiore brought his three children on stage to demonstrate the feature. Actress Jessica Alba lent star power to the event, endorsing Kid's Corner as a 'busy mom.' Owners will also be able link apps to their lock screen, giving them at-a-glance information such as sports scores. Windows 8 for computers has borrowed its look from Windows Phone 7, presenting applications not as icons but as 'Live Tiles,' which can be animated with data from the application. For instance, the 'Pictures' tile shows a slideshow. Jessica Alba talks about how she uses the new features on the new Windows Phone 8 as a working mother and business owner . The live tiles and the distinctive user interface remain Microsoft's biggest selling points for Windows Phone. In terms of third-party applications and the features of the phones, it's mostly playing catch-up to the iPhone and Android. Microsoft will be emphasizing the consistent look across devices in a massive advertising campaign that will talk not just about its new software, but its venture in hardware manufacturing. On Friday, Microsoft released its first tablet computer, the Surface. 'Between Windows 8, Microsoft Surface or Windows Phone 8, you won't be able to turn on the TV or open a magazine without seeing a Microsoft Windows ad,' Ballmer said.","Firm hopes combination of new desktop, tablet and phone software will attract consumers .

Obama has attempted to pacify jittery gun-owners by talking about his love of clay pigeon shooting. The President's words will be seen as an attempt to reassure conservative voters who are angry about his plans to ban assault weapons as part of a drastic overhaul of gun laws. In a soon-to-be published interview with The New Republic, President Obama is asked whether he has ever fired a gun. He said:  ‘Yes, . in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time.’ Scroll down for video . Shooter: Obama has spoken of enjoying clay pigeon shooting at Camp David as an angry debate over gun law changes goes on . He added: ‘Not the girls, but oftentimes guests . of mine go up there. And I have a profound respect for the traditions of . hunting that trace back in this country for generations. 'And I think . those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake.’ The President's plans for tighter firearms regulations were drawn up by Vice President Joe Biden and include a ban on military-style assault weapons and a 10-shot limit on the magazines of weapons. They are a response to the shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, last month. Tough sell: Obama faces strong opposition to his proposed new gun laws, despite which he says he has a 'profound respect' for the nation's history of hunting with firearms . However, President Obama told gun control advocates . they need to do 'a little more listening' as he discussed his stance on . assault weapons. 'Part of being able to move this . forward,' President Obama says, 'is understanding the reality of guns in . urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural . areas.' According . to the Associated Press, the president says in the interview that he . has a 'profound respect' for America's long tradition of hunting with . firearms. He pointed to this history as the reason many gun rights advocates are so protective of their constitutional right to bear arms. The proposals to change gun laws have been made in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre . 'If you grew up and your dad gave you a . hunting rifle when you were ten,' the president said, 'and that became . part of your family's traditions, you can see why you'd be pretty . protective of that.' Obama referred to the gap between . urban and rural views on gun ownership as 'part of the biggest task over . the next several months' in his fight for public support of his assault . weapons ban. 'And that' he says, 'means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening . than they do sometimes.' Earlier . this month, the president signed 23 executive actions aimed at . tightening gun laws. These do not require congressional approval. Gun . rights advocates like those at the National Rifle Association, who say . Obama's move to overhaul gun control will only affect honest, law-abiding gun . owners. Long battle: Obama's gun laws are unlikely to be passed through the Republican-dominated House and both sides say they are prepared for a drawn out battle . 'Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation,' the NRA said in a statement after Obama signed his order alongside Vice President Joe Biden and several children who wrote him letters asking for greater gun controls. Obama has also asked congress to renew the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, restrict magazines to no more than 10 rounds, and expand background check requirements to cover gun conventions and private sales. The interview will appear in the February 11 issue of The New Republic.","President said 'we do skeet shooting all the time' at Camp David .

British expats in South Sudan have described their daring rescue by RAF pilots as the African nation teeters on the brink of civil war. Hundreds of Brits packed onto the runway at Juba airport desperately waiting for the C17 Globemaster to spirit them to safety while the distant sound of gunfire grew louder. But minutes before the 266-tonne plane was due to arrive, a Sudanese passenger jet crash landed on the tarmac making it impossible far any other plane to touch down. Dave . Stanley, who was waiting for evacuation, said the nose undercarriage of . the Boeing 737 appeared to have collapsed with the sound of an explosion . as it landed completely blocking their only escape route. Stricken: The South Sudanese Boeing 747, owned by Nova Air, crash landed on the runway blocking the British RAF Globemaster from landing . Relief: Hundreds of British expats packed onto the plane after the daring landing as they fled the country that sits on the brink of all-out civil war . Above them circled the Globemaster, which had completed a nine-hour, 3,500-mile journey from Brize Norton air base in Oxfordshire, as air chiefs in Britain prepared to call off the mission and try again tomorrow. But by a stroke of luck, a crane belonging to the United Nation happened to have been left in a nearby yard and . the Sudanese jet was eventually towed out of the way, allowing the . pilot of the Globemaster to make what the Ministry of Defence . described as a 'daring, precision landing' on the cleared runway. Globemaster: The C17 (pictured) is designed to carry out high-angle, steep approaches at relatively slow speeds, which allows it to operate into small airfields with short, narrow runways in difficult conditions . Mr . Stanley, from Ashton in Kent, told Radio 4's Today programme that . until Sunday, Juba had seemed calm with 'no warning of any trouble'. But on Monday morning, he was told not to leave his hotel. 'We . were hearing gunshots,' he said. 'But things really picked up quite dramatically . after about 9 o'clock in the morning when there were gun battles pretty . much all around Juba, as best we could tell. 'There . was shooting close to the hotel and it was actually closer the . following day, but we couldn't tell who it was. We were told it was . government soldiers fighting rebels or insurgents, whatever you want to . call them.' Of the rescue, he added: 'It was . chaotic, because we arrived at the airport before 10 o'clock in the . morning and we had to wait to try to find out what was happening. 'One . of the Sudanese airlines, Nova Air, came in with a flight - it may well . have been a charter flight for evacuation - and on landing we heard an . explosion and we subsequently saw the aircraft and the front landing . gear had collapsed. Whether a tyre had burst or whether it was the . collapse of the landing kit I don't know, but it left the Boeing 737 . stuck in the middle of the runway. Fears: As the British expats waited for the C17 Globemaster to spirit them to safety, the distant sound of gunfire echoed from the streets of Juba, growing louder . Power struggle: On Sunday President Salva Kiir (pictured) said that troops loyal to his ousted Vice President Riek Machar opened fire on a government meeting in an attempted coup . 'We . were told that the RAF plane was going to do a fly-past to look at the . runway. Obviously their intention was to see if they could land on what . remained of the runway. They did that and decided that they couldn't . land, in fact. Then there was an announcement on the ground that the . flight was going to be delayed until the next day, which caused some . other problems. 'But at that . point, while the aircraft was still there, they managed to find a crane . from the UN and move the damaged aircraft off the runway. Fortunately, . the RAF plane was still circling and was able to land very quickly.' Dangers: US President Barack Obama has warned that South Sudan's 'great progress' towards breaking the cycle of violence in the country could be undone by this latest spate of fighting . The . commanding officer of the RAF's 99 Squadron, Wing Commander Stuart . Lindsell, said: 'We practise short landings in training but getting down . on a runway with a crashed aircraft taking up a large part of it would . really concentrate the mind and is way outside what we would normally . expect. 'I think it's fair . to say that this C17 captain and his crew have had one of the toughest . days anyone on this squadron has had since we were stood up 12 years . ago. It's not just the air crew but the RAF regiment who provided . protection on the ground, the movers who helped get the passengers on . board, the medics and the engineers - all of them have all performed . brilliantly and I'm extremely proud of them.' On . board the RAF aircraft were medics, force protection and air movements . personnel, and Foreign Office officials whose job was to assist people . wanting to leave the country. Some 182 Britons and Commonwealth and EU . citizens were evacuated to Entebbe, 350 miles away in neighbouring . Uganda, but some had to leave their luggage behind at the airport. 'They . told us that normally on one of these RAF C17 transporters they can . take 132 passengers,' said Mr Stanley. 'In the end they just filled it . up as much as they could. People had to leave their luggage pretty much . on the runway at Juba airport and they put on everybody they could. The . final number was 182, which they said was a record for this kind of . operation.' Since the fighting started Kiir has imposed a night time curfew and has arrested ten former ministers . The . C17 is designed to carry out high-angle, steep approaches at relatively . slow speeds, which allows it to operate into small airfields with short, . narrow runways in difficult conditions. Within the last year it has . used these capabilities delivering aid to typhoon victims in the . Philippines and transporting military equipment to Mali and the Central . African Republic. Fighting has . spread through the newly formed East African state, which gained its . independence in 2011, following a reported coup attempt in the capital . at the weekend. The conflict in South Sudan began on Sunday when . troops loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar allegedly opened fire . at a government meeting in an attempt to force President Salva Kiir (pictured) from . power. Machar was sacked . along with the entire rest of the cabinet in July after announcing he . was going to contest the 2015 general election. Fears that fighting could spread into . all-out civil war stem from the fact that Kiir is from the minority . Dinka ethnic group, while Machar is a Nuer. Around . 20,000 South Sudanese are now sheltering in UN camps, with the Akobo . base being attacked yesterday with the possible death of civilians. As . well as drawing the attention of the US President, the conflict has . also concerned neighbouring African states including Ethiopia, Kenya, . Uganda who have sent mediators to attempt to find a resolution. In . a statement on Thursday, Kiir said he was willing to talk to anyone who . would listen, but that he was unsure what the possible outcome could . be. The Foreign . Office has strongly advised all remaining British nationals to leave the . country amid fears it could prove difficult to get out if there is any . further deterioration in the situation. 'The . UK plans to send a second flight to South Sudan to evacuate British . nationals who wish to leave from Juba airport on Friday December 20, . following the evacuation of some British nationals on December 19,' a .

In a statement the President said: 'In 2011, millions of South Sudanese voted to forge a new nation, founded on the promise of a more peaceful and prosperous future for all of South Sudan's people.

Rain is the likely culprit in a pair of California tour bus accidents only miles apart that have left one dead and dozens injured. The buses overturned in both accidents, which occurred about 30 miles and about 10 minutes apart on Interstate 15 north of San Diego- one in Fallbrook claimed the life of one passenger and left 22 injured, the one in Corona left 30 injured. The Fallbrook crash involved seven or eight vehicles and killed one person while 22 others were taken to local hospitals â€“ the deceased is a woman who was ejected from and pinned underneath the wreckage, according to NBC Los Angeles. Those injured in Corona were mostly minor, with one in critical condition at a local hospital, according to the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin. Scroll down for video . Deadly: The Fallbrook crash killed one and injured 22 - many of whom were ejected from the bus . Blame it on the rain: The Corona accident happened after the bus hydroplaned on the rain-slicked highway, according to the driver . The Fallbrook bus, operated by Five Star Bus Charter, was traveling southbound on I-15 at 55mph at about 2.30pm when it began swerving, the driver told investigators, according to ABC 10. Multiple other people were ejected from the bus, according to KABC, but only one person died, the others somehow suffered only minor injuries. The deceased has not yet been publicly identified. The highway was slick after it had been raining in torrents a short time earlier, which the driver blamed for the deadly accident, the station said. The overturned bus caused massive delays as multiple lanes of the highway had to be closed during the rescue operation. Taken away: This man is carried away on a stretcher after surviving the Fallbrook bus accident . Several injuries: Almost two dozen people were injured in the Fallbrook accident, many were tended to right next to the highway . OUtdoor triage: One of the injured is wheled away while another is tended to in the wet grass . Shaken: A woman wrapped in a blanket is led away from the wrecked bus . Authorities are still investigating the accident, but havenâ€™t ruled out rain as the cause. The bus had been traveling from Los Angeles to Valley View Casino, in San Diego, according to ABC 10. The deadly accident happened only 30 miles from a separate accident in Corona. The Corona accident, which occurred at 2.43pm, left 30 injured, mostly minor, according to the Los Angeles Daily News. A California Highway Patrol Officer told the paper that it was raining hard at the time of the accident, but it is not yet clear if that is the main cause. Kicked out: Survivors in the Corona bus accident crawled out through escape hatches in the roof and were carried out through the removed windshield by rescuers . Wheeled away: Another victim of the Fallbrook crash is loaded into an ambulance to be taken to a local hospital . A massive undertaking: Several dozen emergency workers tended to the injured and investigated the cause of the deadly Fallbrook accident . As far as the eye can see: Traffic was snarled for miles as lanes were closed and motorists slowed down to look at the deadly Fallbrook accident . All northbound lanes were closed while fire fighters pulled injured people from the overturned bus, others wriggled their way through kicked-out escape hatch on the roof, according to KTLA. The bus was heading to nearby Garden Grove from the Pala Casino Spa & Resort, also in San Diego, according to KABC. Both accidents resulted in massive traffic delays going in both directions as passersby slowed down to take a look. The bus, owned by Sina Coach, was carrying mostly Vietnamese gamblers, a spokesperson told NBC Los Angeles. Five Star Bus has had two crashes in the past two years, but Sina Coach has zero. The cause of both accidents remains under investigation, according to reports.","Buses overturned in heavy rain while traveling on Interstate 15 .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 13:36 EST, 20 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:49 EST, 20 December 2013 . Male soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen are now sharing most of their duties with women, and their testosterone-fueled wartime activities are bringing the worst out of many when women are in close quarters with them . President Obama put his foot own on Friday – sort of – and demanded to know what the Defense Department is doing to stem the tide of military sexual assaults. But the answer, he said, can come on December 1, 2014. That's after the midterm congressional elections, weeks too late to be politically damaging if the military he commands publishes a reminder of how many sex abusers are in the ranks that Obama leads as commander-in-chief. Thursday saw the passage of a wide-ranging national defense budget authorization bill, which included a watered-down version of sexual-assault reforms favored by New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. The new law requires the Pentagon to assign an advocate to every servicewoman or man who reports an assault. It also bars commanders from overturning sex-assault verdicts. But missing from the final bill were Gillibrand's more aggressive proposals, including a move to take sexual assault cases completely out of the military chain of command, and another giving prosecutors – not commanding officers – discretion in deciding which cases to take to military court. A Republican Senate aide with knowledge of the back-room deals struck as final passage of the bill neared told MailOnline on Friday that the Obama administration and many on Capitol Hill take a more pragmatic approach than Gillibrand. 'Honestly, . I think there's a fear that the more you demand the Pentagon . investigate this, the more ugly stuff they'll find,' the aide said. 'And . when you come right down to it, no one really wants to lower the . testosterone levels in the military. That's how we win.' Gillibrand's office did not reply to a request for a response to that statement. Kirsten Gillibrand is among a group of female U.S. senators who have taken a zero-tolerance position on military sexual assaults . 'The more you demand the Pentagon investigate this, the more ugly stuff they'll find,' predicted one Senate aide on the Republican side of the aisle . Obama responded to the new law on Friday by setting a progress deadline for Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey, giving them more than eleven months to report back to the White House. 'I do not want to wait another year to . enact the one reform survivors have asked for,' Gillibrand said in a statement immediately after Obama released his instructions to the military. She said the priority should be 'removing commanders . with no legal training and conflicts of interest from the decision of . whether or not to prosecute a rape or sexual assault.' '[M]y immediate focus,' Gillibrand added, 'will remain on earning the votes to pass the fundamental reform needed to address the fact that last year alone an estimated 23,000 sexual assault victims lacked the confidence to report their attacks out of fear their chain of command would not act – or worse yet – retaliate against them.' The White House had released a statement from the president describing how he had 'directed Secretary Hagel, Chairman Dempsey and our entire defense leadership team to step up their game exponentially in preventing and responding to the serious crime of sexual assault in our military.' 'Today,' Obama said, 'I instructed Secretary Hagel and Chairman Dempsey to continue their efforts to make substantial improvements with respect to sexual assault prevention and response, including to the military justice system. I have also directed that they report back to me, with a full-scale review of their progress, by December 1, 2014.' 'If I do not see the kind of progress I expect, then we will consider additional reforms that may be required.' Major players: Sen. Claire McCaskill (R) pressed her colleagues behind the scenes for tougher action, while Majority Leader Harry Reid (L) promised Gillibrand a separate vote on her no-nonsense measures that were left out of the larger defense bill . What Would Michelle Think? One Senate aide speculated that the president pushed back his deadline until after the 2014 midterm elections because he fears public recognition of how much sexual assault goes on in the military he commands . A White House official told MailOnline that the president 'is serious about resolving this problem in a way that improves, instead of weakens, our military readiness.' But the GOP Senate aide said that 'there's no way Gillibrand was going to get everything she wanted.' 'First, there are some old-boy types in the Senate who think a lot of this is exaggerated – don't ask me why,' he told MailOnline. 'And then there are some on our side who really don't want to give Democrats another reason to scream ""war on women"" next November.' Far-reaching crisis: A Denver man offered $20,000 in cash, a Mercedes-Benz and a $14,000 ring to fellow inmates in an attempt to kill a military rape victim before she testified at his trial . Obama's move to push his next deadline back to December, the aide said, is likely a way 'to keep Democrats' neck out of the noose during the midterms. After all, Obama owns this military, five years in.' The Senate approved the larger defense bill on an 84–15 vote Thursday. While it includes more than $632 billion for everything from combat pay to new airplanes, the sexual assault provisions provided the most contentious parts of the debate. The Pentagon has estimated that more than 26,000 military women and men may have been sexually assaulted in 2012. White critics say that estimate is far from a hard number, Defense Department analysts say it could be too low since thousands more are thought to have been too scared to come forward. Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire . McCaskill, one of seven women on the Senate Armed Services Committee, . praised the outcome Thursday as 'a huge win for victims of sexual . assault, and for justice in America's armed forces.' 'In . the months and years ahead, vigilance will be required to ensure that . these historic reforms are implemented forcefully and effectively,' she . said. Gillibrand's more . far-reaching proposals will likely have another hearing as part of a . separate bill. Majority Leader Harry Reid has reportedly promised her . that he will give the more aggressive legislative package a vote early . in 2014. A Pentagon aide . told MailOnline that the Defense Department expects to work with the . White House to develop a series of minimum-standards benchmarks that . will govern how the military responds to sexual-assault allegations in . 2015 and beyond.","Obama set a Dec. 1, 2014 deadline for a military report on combating sexual assaults .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:49 EST, 20 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:02 EST, 20 December 2013 . The number of U.S. sailors who claim to have been poisoned by radiation while serving during the 2011 tsunami in Japan - resulting in cases of leukemia, thyroid and testicular cancers, chronic bronchitis and brain tumors - has jumped to 51, as the group continue to fight the company they say didn't report the contamination when it happened. The U.S. Navy members who were allegedly infected - who served aboard the USS Ronald Reagan and its sister ship the USS Essex - started to develop strange symptoms and sicknesses in the months following their mission near the Fukushima nuclear power plant, such as lumps, night sweats and dramatic weight-loss. Now the majority of the group who worked in the rescue effort have been diagnosed with an assortment of diseases, after their ships' desalination systems pulled in contaminated seawater that was used for drinking, cooking and bathing. Sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76) conduct a counter-measure washdown to remove potential radiation contamination while operating off the coast of Japan providing humanitarian assistance in the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami. Some 51 sailors involved in the effort are claiming to have been contaminated . Sailors working aboard USS Ronald Reagan during the 2011 tsunami effort in Fukushima, where a nuclear power plant went into meltdown, have been diagnosed with a variety of cancers they claim is a result of radiation contamination . Aerial shot shows white smoke billowing from a window in the No. 2 reactor building at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima, northeastern Japan, following a tsunami in March 2011 . In a lawsuit filed against Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the plaintiffs claim the power company delayed telling the U.S. Navy the tsunami had caused a nuclear meltdown, sending huge amounts of contaminated water into the sea and, ultimately, into the ship's water system. 'At our level, we werenâ€™t told anything,' Jamie Plym, who has been fighting bronchitis and hemorrhaging, told FoxNews.com. 'We were told everything was OK.' 'They said as long as the plume was avoided we would be fine. 'But we knew then that something was going to happen. 'Common sense tells you that the wind would blow it everywhere. You donâ€™t need to be a nuclear scientist to figure that out.' San Francisco Attorney Charles Bonner, who is representing the allegedly cancer-stricken sailors, initially filed a federal suit in the Southern District of California more than a year ago on behalf of a dozen sailors. Aftermath: Aerial view of tsunami damage in an area north of Sendai, Japan, taken from a U.S. Navy helicopter assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan on March 13, 2011. An earthquake measuring 8.9 on the Richter scale hit the northeast coast of Japan causing a tsunami . The lawsuit was initially dismissed, when the court ruled that any ruling would hinge on interpreting communication between the Japanese and U.S. governments, which could violate the separation of powers. But Bonner is amending the suit to add new allegations that would fall under the court's jurisdiction. And the number of plaintiffs has more than quadrupled as more service members come forward with radiation-related illnesses, he said. 'They went in to help with rescue efforts,' said Bonner. 'They did not go in prepared to deal with radiation containment.' The new suit will be refiled on January 6. The plaintiffs don't blame the U.S. Navy, which they believe acted in good faith, Bonner said. It was the plant's operators who sat on the meltdown information during the crucial hours following the March 11, 2011 disaster, he said. 'TEPCO pursued a policy which caused rescuers, including the plaintiffs, to rush into an unsafe area which was too close to the [Fukushima nuclear power plant] that had been damaged,' Bonner charged in an April filing now being updated to add more plaintiffs. The damaged roof of reactor number No. 1 (L) is seen next to an undamaged reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant after an explosion that blew off the upper part of the structure in Fukushima Prefecture, northeastern Japan, March 12, 2011. Japanese authorities battling to contain rising pressure in nuclear reactors damaged by a massive earthquake were forced to release radioactive steam from one plant  after evacuating tens of thousands of residents from the area . 'Relying upon the misrepresentation regarding health and safety made by TEPCO, upon information and belief, the U.S. Navy was lulled into a false sense of security. 'The officers and crew of the U.S.S. Reagan (CVN-76) and other vessels believed that it was safe to operate within the waters adjacent to the FNPP, without doing the kinds of research and testing that would have verified the problems known to the defendant TEPCO at the time.' Nathan Piekutoski, 22, who served aboard the USS Essex, which was in the same deployment as the Reagan, said sailors had no choice but to trust what they were told. 'They did say it was safe at the time,' Piekutoski said. 'We had to take their word for it.' Piekutowski now suffers from leukemia and, while he is currently in remission, doctors have told him that he may need a bone marrow transplant. The Pentagon has been monitoring and collecting data on radiation exposure in the region, a Department of Defense spokesman said. TEPCO officials have not responded to requests for comment. Soldiers aboard the USS aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan (pictured) were unaware they were being contaminated by radiation while serving in the 2011 Japanese tsunami effort Fukushima and were told by authorities the conditions were safe, claims their attorney . But during a recent meeting before members of the Japanese press on December 12, former Prime Minister Naoto Jan said the first meltdown occurred five hours after the tsunami, not the next day as reported at the time. Bonner believes the statement means the Japanese government knew radiation was being leaked and did not inform the U.S. Navy. 'They knew there was an active meltdown and they deliberately hid it from the public as well as the Navy,' Bonner said. 'Those sailors went in there totally unaware and they were contaminated as a result.' Plym says she is prepared to have her symptoms questioned in court, should the case go to trial. But with so many U.S. sailors coming forward, she believes justice will prevail. 'People will say that out lawsuit is fake and that we are doing this for money, but itâ€™s really about getting the correct information out there,' she said.","USS Ronald Reagan and its sister ship USS Essex worked the rescue effort near the Fukushima nuclear power following the Japanese tsunami in 2011 .

Hard sell: Edward Snowden has previously sought asylum in Brazil and now is trying to get the public on his side by writing an open letter, describing how he would be able to help in their fight against surveillance . Snowden's lengthy letter said that . he's been inspired by the global debate ignited by his release of . thousands of National Security Agency documents, and that the NSA's . culture of indiscriminate global espionage 'is collapsing.' In . the letter, released widely online, Snowden commended the Brazilian . government for its strong stand against spying and wrote that he would . aid them in investigating claims that Brazil is one of the victims of . NSA - if they give him asylum. However, several Brazilian politicians, mainly opponents of Rousseff's leftist government, said granting Snowden asylum would be counter-productive and would lead to further deterioration of ties with the United States, the country's largest trading partner after China. Revelations about the NSA's spy programs were first published in June, based on some of the thousands of documents Snowden handed over to the Brazil-based American journalist Glenn Greenwald and his reporting partner Laura Poitras, a U.S. filmmaker. The documents revealed that Brazil is the top NSA target in Latin America, spying that has included the monitoring of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's cellphone and hacking into the internal network of state-run oil company Petrobras. The revelations enraged Rousseff, who in October canceled an official visit to Washington that was to include a state dinner. She's also pushing the United Nations to give citizens more protections against spying.Handle . Offended: Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has blasted President Obama and cancelled a state visit to America over the revelations of how records of her personal cell phone calls were collected . In his letter, Snowden dismissed U.S. explanations to the Brazilian government and others that the bulk . metadata gathered on billions of emails and calls was more 'data . collection' than surveillance. 'There . is a huge difference between legal programs, legitimate spying ... and . these programs of dragnet mass surveillance that put entire populations . under an all-seeing eye and save copies forever,' he wrote. 'These programs were never about terrorism: they're about economic spying, social control, and diplomatic manipulation. They're about power.' Brazilian senators had asked for Snowden's help during hearings about the NSA's targeting of Brazil, an important transit hub for trans-Atlantic fiber optic cables that are hacked. Both Greenwald and his domestic partner David Miranda spoke before the senate, and Miranda has taken up the cause of persuading the Brazilian government to grant political asylum to Snowden. Snowden, who is living in Russia on a temporary one-year visa, previously requested political asylum in Brazil and several other nations. On Tuesday, neither Brazil's Foreign Ministry nor the presidential office said they had immediate comment on Snowden's letter or any pending asylum request. 'Six months ago, I revealed that the NSA wanted to listen to the whole world,' Snowden wrote. 'Now, the whole world is listening back, and speaking out, too. Trying to help: Journalist Glenn Greenwald and his Brazilian partner have taken up Snowden's case and have lobbied the Brazilian government, to no avail at this point . â€˜The culture of indiscriminate worldwide surveillance, exposed to public debates and real investigations on every continent, is collapsing.' Several members of Brazil's congress have called for Snowden to receive asylum, so that he could assist lawmakers' investigation into NSA activity in Brazil. Rousseff recently joined Germany in pushing for the United Nations to adopt a symbolic resolution which seeks to extend personal privacy rights to all people. The Brazilian leader has also ordered her government to take several measures, including laying fiber optic lines directly to Europe and South American nations, in an effort to 'divorce' Brazil from the U.S.-centric backbone of the Internet that experts say has facilitated NSA spying. The Snowden letter was first published Tuesday in a Portuguese translation by the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper. The AP later obtained the original English version. It comes one day after a U.S. district judge ruled that the NSA's bulk collection of millions of Americans' telephone records likely violates the U.S. Constitution's ban on unreasonable search. The case is likely to go to the Supreme Court for a final decision.","Brazil have no plans to grand asylum to Snowden, government officials say .

For Bella Hosford, dealing with the loss of her beloved great grandma did not come easy. Minnie Sue Watts died in August 2012, and the little girl, from Chapel Hill, Tennessee, misses her each day. 'I really do miss her, because she was my favoritest grandmother ever,' Bella said. 'The last day I got to see her, it was a really special day to me, because I knew that she was going to go to Heaven,' Bella said. 'When I hugged her, the last thing she ever said to me was, ''I love you, Bella''.' Recently, Bella decided she needed to send a message to Heaven, according to KLTV. Touched by an angel: When Bella Hosford, from Chapel Hill in Tennessee, sent a balloon to heaven with a message for her late great-grandma, she never anticipated what she would get in return . Message on a balloon: Bella Hosford missed her late great grandmother Minnie Sue Watts (left) so much she decided to attach a note to a balloon asking her to 'come visit soon' and cast it off into the summer air . With the help of her mom, Tricia Hosford, they got a helium balloon and attached a note to it on pink saying: 'Tell Mawmaw I love and to come visit soon. Love Bella.' Months passed, but then on Monday a mysterious package arrived in the mail to their home in Chapel Hill, a rural Marshal County town of only about 1000 people. It was a box wrapped in brown paper, along with the broken balloon and Bella's pink note. Inside the box was a beautiful silver locket. And on the back on the original note read the message: 'Dearest Bella. Mawmaw is always with you. Just close your eyes and you will see her. Love, your guardian angel.' The package: On Monday: Bella Hosford and her mother Tricia found quite a surprise in their mailbox - Bella's letter and balloon, along with a new note and a gift-wrapped box . Prized possession: Inside the box was this silver locket, which must have been sent by a Good Samaritan who found the balloon and its message . Gobsmacked: Bella and Tricia Hosford said they sat on their driveway for 'five, ten minutes' and 'cried and embraced and absorbed the moment' Both mother and daughter were completely floored. 'We stood at the end of the driveway for probably five, 10 minutes, just crying and embracing and just absorbing the moment,' Tricia said. The pair have no idea who sent the poignant package. 'It was a very selfless act, especially at this time of the year, that is worth volumes,' Tricia Hosford said. 'I have no idea. No idea. It's priceless.' The Hosford family live in a small farming town in Tennessee called Chapel Hill, with a population of only about 1000, which only adds to the intrigue of how someone managed to find the balloon . Bella said she initially couldn't consider it to be from anyone 'but mawmaw', but her mom has explained it to her. 'If I knew who that person was, I would walk up to them and hug them on their neck and tell them thank you,' Bella said, adding that the locket is now her most prized possession.","Bella Hosford, of Chapel Hill, Tennessee, has missed her great grandma, Minnie Sue Watts, since she passed away in August 2012 .

A new smartphone app could finally solve the scourge of abandoned trolleys and the damage they cause to the British countryside. The Trolleywise app - available for Apple and Android devices - lets users send photos of abandoned trolleys along with their GPS locations to a national collection service. One of 47 local Trolleywise vans can then be sent to the location within 24 hours to recover the trolley and return it to nearby supermarkets - saving local authorities and retailers millions of pounds in clean-up costs each year. Scroll down for video . The new Trolleywise app lets users take photos of abandoned trolleys on their smartphone phones. The photos and the GPS coordinates are then sent to a national collection service, which sends a van within 24 hours to recover and return the trolley to nearby supermarkets . According to Trolleywise, more than half of all shopping trolleys in service in the UK - around 1.5 million - go missing from supermarket car parks each year. Many end up on wasteland, housing estates, parks, railways or water ways and are dangerous to wildlife and children. Jeff Whyatt from The Canal and River Trust said: 'We have a national treasure of canals in this country, but they're often blighted by fly-tipped trolleys. 'They're an eyesore, but also they're a danger to boats and the ecology of the canal. 'Furthermore they make the canals just look unloved.' His company has been working with Trolleywise for three years to help deal with the problem in the 'most efficient manner.' The Trolleywise app is free and is available on Apple and Android devices. The company has 47 collection teams in vans across the country that can respond to abandoned trolley reports. Users can specify a location, shown in the right-hand screen grab, or use GPS to automatically locate them . According to Trolleywise more than half of all shopping trolleys in service in the UK - around one million - go missing from supermarket car parks each year. Many end up on wasteland, housing estates, parks, railways or water ways . There are around two million trolleys in operation in the UK at any one time. Around 1.5 million trolleys are taken from supermarket car parks each year. Many are abandoned in wasteland, parks, waterways and housing estates. Trolleywise has 47 collection teams that pick up around 400,000 trolleys a year. According to Whyatt, if all the trolleys recovered were stacked on top of one another, they would be taller than Canary Wharf. Local authorities, retailers and environmental charities spend millions of pounds each year returning trolleys to supermarket car parks. Local authorities are currently responsible for . rounding up abandoned trolleys. They then charge some of the repatriation back to the . supermarkets, often by way of fines. These costs are passed onto consumers through increased council tax bills and higher food prices. The new Trolleywise system, which is . backed by all the major supermarkets including Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's, lets consumers 'take control of a . more rapid and joined-up clean-up.' A Sainsbury's spokesperson told MailOnline: 'All our stores want to be a good neighbour so we work with Trolleywise to ensure any abandoned trolleys are quickly collected. 'We hope other retailers will follow our lead in recognising their responsibilities to the communities they serve and sign up to this scheme.' Tony Barber, managing director of Trolleywise said: 'We have made a substantial impact in managing the . abandoned trolley challenge, with Trolleywise retrieving almost one . million trolleys since 2012. The Trolleywise has three main sections - a welcome screen, a Report A Trolley function that lets users send abandoned trolley locations to a national collection service, and a stats page that shows the users how many trolleys they're reported and where they found them . 'However, we want to eliminate the problem . altogether and return pride to our local communities. 'The app makes it . very easy for people to report trolleys quickly and accurately.' For every trolley collected by Trolleywise, the team donates to independent charity Trees for Cities. The campaign hopes to . raise enough money to plant at least 2,000 new trees in Britainâ€™s urban . areas each year, the equivalent of taking almost 150 cars off the UK . roads. Barber continued: 'By . swapping abandoned trolleys for trees, we want to make a positive impact . on communities.'' A graphic from Trolleywise explaining the enviornmental impact of abandoned trolleys . Sharon Johnson, CEO of Trees for Cities, added: 'We often come across . abandoned trolleys as part of our tree-planting work in local . communities. 'We hear from our volunteers that there is confusion about . how to report them and whose responsibility it is to pick them up. 'Weâ€™re delighted that Trolleywise has launched this app to make . the process so simple.' As well as being eyesores, abandoned trolleys can cause environmental damage. Local authorities are currently responsible for recovering trolleys and returning them to supermarkets. This can costs both councils and retailers money and these costs are then passed onto consumers through council tax and food price rises . Trolleywise launched in 2006 to help reduce the impact abandoned trolleys have on the local environment, said Barber: 'because when they get abandoned there's a big drain on the local councils and on  retailers to try and collect the trolleys and put them back into service. ' He said that trolleys can end up in many places and the company had even recovered a trolley from on top of a bus stop.

It’s a familiar feeling of panic – that moment you realise you’ve spilt the entire contents of your coffee cup all over computer. Right now in offices up and down the country, thousands of people are holding their heads in horror and scrabbling for anything dry to limit the damage. Now, one inventor from Connecticut has come up with a remarkably simple solution to put an end to the hazards of drinking while working. A new cup holder has been invented to stop office workers spilling drinks on their keyboards. The special device looks like something that might be found in a car and clamps on to the side of a desk to hold a drink . The contraption, named the Vector Cupholder, was invented by Cliff Thier after some of his friends broke their computers or burned themselves when spilling their drinks. The £30 gadget can hold any size drinks from small plastic cups all the way up to a large takeaway container, pint glass, and a thermos. Because the centre of gravity of the beverage has been moved, it makes it almost impossible to knock over. The contraption, named the Vector Cupholder, was invented by Cliff Thier after some of his friends broke their computers or burned themselves when spilling their drinks . The Vector cupholder is made of a solid aluminum and clamps to tables, desks and trays up to 1.5 inches in thickness. The £30 device has the ability to support a variety of containers and mugs up to three inches in diameter. It can also support paper and plastic cups,  thermos bottles and even the odd cup you get on airplanes. Because the centre of gravity of the beverage has been moved - up to the container's rim - it makes it almost impossible to knock over. Mr Thier drew up a series of designs and built a prototype before putting it on a crowd funding website Kickstarter to raise money for the manufacturing process. He aimed to raise £1,500 but was given a total of £7,000 and he is now manufacturing the handy device. The 52-year-old said: ‘I know people who have burned themselves and fried their computers when they've knocked over a drink. ‘I started thinking about the problem as we are more frequently working alongside a tall drink whether at home, work, a classroom, on the road or in a cafe or hotel. ‘I collected and took the measurements of . every cup I could get from cafes and sketched out different approaches . before making several prototypes and then a final design.

Al-Shihri is reported to have been involved in the failed operation that targeted assassination of the Saudi interior minister, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef in 2009, as well as kidnapping of foreigners in Yemen and the 2008 embassy bombing. The news of his death came as an official watchdog warned of the threat from the Yemeni-branch of Al Qaeda. The independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC, reported that terrorism plots in Britain are becoming less complex and involve fewer participants, but highlighted the threat from Yemen. ‘We are certainly not seeing now what we saw in the years around 2005, 2006, which are the large, ambitious, 9/11-style plots perhaps to bring down simultaneously several airliners,’ he told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘However, Al Qaida has been diversifying or fragmenting - particularly in the Yemen. ‘Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula do still have good technicians and they have people who can make bombs.

Ostreicher charged later that prosecutors . and other government employees had illegally sold 18,000 metric tons of . the venture's rice and stole equipment as well as demanded a $50,000 . payoff to get him out of jail.

'They robbed me of close to $50 million worth of assets,' Ostreicher told the AP in an interview a year ago. He said that in addition to the rice, about 900 cattle disappeared along with 37 tractors and harvesting equipment. Bolivian authorities have said since that 15 people had been arrested in the alleged extortion ring, including an assistant to the judicial director of the Interior Ministry. Last June, prosecutors said two low-ranking officials among those arrested had pleaded guilty and were cooperating in hopes of serving less jail time.","State Department official confirms Jacob Ostreicher has left Bolivia .

So many migrants flooded into Britain from Eastern Europe that authorities were unable to count them, Whitehall admitted yesterday. Official migration figures missed out nearly half a million people who came to the UK after their countries joined the EU in 2004, according to a newly-published document. The scale of the problem was only revealed in the 2011 census, which showed the population was even bigger than estimated. A document shows migration figures missed out nearly half a million people who came to the UK after their countries joined the EU in 2004 . The admission comes amid growing concern over immigration, as Britain prepares to open its doors to citizens from Romania and Bulgaria. Workers from the two countries will have free access to jobs in this country from the end of the year, but the Government has failed to confirm how many people they expect to arrive. The 2011 census found there were 464,000 more people living in England and Wales than originally thought. Now a paper, published by the Office for National Statistics, has acknowledged for the first time that the majority of the people who slipped through the net were Eastern European migrants. Between 2002 and 2010, mass immigration under the Labour government was running at its highest. Until now ONS officials claimed at least 200,000 were long-term British inhabitants. But the new ONS paper said: 'At national level the difference is believed to be largely due to international migration. 'In particular an underestimate of the number of immigrants from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that joined the EU in 2004.' A paper, published by the Office for National Statistics, has acknowledged for the first time that the majority of the people who slipped through the net were Eastern European migrants . The mistake led to repeated pronouncements that there were 700,000 or fewer Poles and Eastern Europeans in Britain. Now authorities accept that the figure is actually more than a million. The ONS results show the difference between the official population count and the real population was more than 25 per cent in some places. In Newham in East London there were supposed to have been 242,400 residents before the census. That figure has now been scaled up and revised to 310,500. Romanian and Bulgarian citizens may work freely in Britain at  the end of this year because  the seven-year period in which Westminster was allowed  to impose restrictions is at an end. Both countries joined the EU in 2007. A BBC poll last week found  that more than 8 per cent of Romanians and nearly 14 per cent of Bulgarians said they would consider migrating to Britain. The MigrationWatch think-tank believes around 50,000 Bulgarian and Romanians will arrive every year for the next five years.","Scale of the problem was only revealed in the 2011 census .

The White House later confirmed that he 'will be joining the White House staff as a counselor to the President' in 2014.

More than 900 adults and children died after drinking cyanide-laced punch . Congressman Leo Ryan (L) was killed while investigating reports that Americans were being kept prisoner at the Jonestown religious colony.

'For . those whoâ€™ve forgotten, a Democratic member of Congress was murdered in . Jonestown and a current one, Rep.

'If this is the attitude of the new White House, it's hard to see how the president gets anything done again.' Jim . Jones, the charismatic 'Peoples Temple' cult leader, brought his . followers to Guyana in 1977, settling in a compound named 'Jonestown' in . his honor.

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 10:29 EST, 20 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:24 EST, 20 December 2013 . A new report has cleared the Secret Service in any institutional wrongdoing and blamed the Colombian prostitution scandal on a few misbehaved agents. 'Although individual employees have engaged in misconduct or inappropriate behavior, we did not find evidence that misconduct is widespread,' the Inspector General's report says. The other most egregious example of professional misconduct came in the form of one incident in 2010 that was described as being 'similar to Cartagena. Brushing past it: The report says that the agency does not have institutional issues but just problems with certain agents who were found to solicit prostitutes and drink with locals while prepping for presidential visits . Many of the identifying details of that incident have been redacted, but ABC News does tell how the agent in question was abroad 'in support of a presidential visit' and drank with locals before he was spotted arriving at the airport with locals that day. Unlike the public debacle that ensued following the Cartagena incident, this 2010 occurrence did not lead to any thorough investigation and the agent in question had their proposed sanctions withdrawn. 'Individuals consumed alcohol; interacted with (female foreign nationals); and were untruthful when initially questioned by managers,' the report reads according to The Washington Post. In addition to brushing past the Cartagena, Colombia scandal that occurred in May 2012, the 18-month investigation also found that there were a handful of reports of agents soliciting prostitutes including one as recent as this year. Again details were scant in the report, but the agent who 'engaged in sexual activity in exchange for money' earlier this year had his security credentials report. All told, the report did not find that 'employees frequently engage in behaviors... that could cause a security concern'. International incident: In May 2012, a Secret Service agent who was in Colombia ahead of the President's visit to the country got into an altercation with a prostitute . Woman in the middle: Dania Suarez was identified as the prostitute involved in the Cartagena scandal . 'Furthermore, we did not find any evidence that [Secret Service] leadership has fostered an environment that tolerates inappropriate behavior.' That statement comes well after the agency's response, as Julia Pierson was promoted to lead the Secret Service in the wake of the scandal's blowback. Administrators are going to have trouble defending the findings, however, as many have questioned the way in which the investigation was completed. Even though technically the investigators heard back from 2,575 employees, their responses came through an anonymous online survey . Ms Pierson, the first female head of the male-dominated industry, slammed the report, wrote that survey participants were told to 'speculate about the personal, sexual, and potential criminal activities of co-workers' based largely on 'rumor and gossip'. Restoring trust: Even new Secret Service head Julia Pierson thinks that the report is flawed since it is based on an anonymous survey of agents who were effectively asked to report 'rumors and gossip' She attached a copy of her letter to the report, which will be released fully today, and tried to assure the public that while the findings may be flawed, the agency has made a number of efforts to right  some of the apparent wrongs. The report cited 14 possible ways for the agency to improve, 11 of which have already been implemented. ‘The criticality of the Secret Service’s mission demands that we maintain the highest levels of integrity in our workforce. I remain committed to investigating and adjudicating all instances of misconduct that are brought to my attention,’ she wrote. The prostitution incident that occurred this year that was alluded to in the report was not the agency’s most recent embarrassment, however, as two Secret Service agents on President Obama's detail were reprimanded in May after one was caught trying to force himself into a woman's hotel room to collect a bullet that he had left there after meeting her hours before in the hotel bar. Scandal prone: The latest Secret Service incident happened in May of this year when an agent (not one of those pictured above) tried to get a bullet that he left in a woman's hotel room . Ignacio Zamora Jr., who works as a senior supervisor in charge of more than 20 agents, was investigated by his superiors after a hotel staffer reported his unusual behavior. The ensuing investigation also found that he and another agent, Timothy Barraclough, were sending sexually suggestive emails to a female subordinate. Both men have now been suspended from the Secret Service and the incident remains under investigation.","Inspector General is releasing an 18-month investigation today that looked at the Colombian prostitution scandal of May 2012 .

A woman who plunged to her death from a bridge with her father and their pet Chihuahua had dreamed of becoming a model before battling with depression, her mother has revealed. More details have emerged hinting at what could have sparked the suicides at Bond Bridge in Kansas City, Missouri on Thursday morning. The father, who is believed to be in his 50s, and his 29-year-old daughter have still not been identified as her mother does not wish to name them and police have not released the details. The pair, who lived together at a mobile home in Peculiar, jumped from the bridge while hand-in-hand and carrying their dog. They fell 120 feet to the water and their bodies have not been recovered. Hunt: Search crews scour the water after a father and his daughter jumped from a bridge with their dog in Missouri last week. The woman's mother has revealed she struggled with depression . The woman's mother, who divorced her . husband two decades ago, said her daughter had struggled with depression . but was happy in recent months and had been planning activities for the . summer. She said she was stunned by . the fact that her ex-husband joined his daughter in jumping from the . bridge, as he had been so instrumental in helping her get through her . depression. 'This has literally blown me away,' the mother told the Kansas City Star, adding that her ex-husband had also previously suffered from depression. 'I'm just numb.' She told the Star that her daughter . was slender and six-feet tall and had dreamed of becoming a model - but . that they had been unable to afford her portfolio. Freezing temperatures: The search has now been called off for the pair in the Mississippi River . Friends remember how she worked . different jobs after high school, but she quit when co-workers were mean . to her. One friend told the Star that she simply did not learn things . as quickly as others. She began working as a babysitter and thrived at the job, her mother said. But around 18 months ago, she had a 'dark period' and spoke of suicide, friend Ryan Wheale said. 'I tried to talk her out of it,' he said. 'But she wouldn't change her mind. She seemed at peace with it.' Afterwards, she cut out many of her friends and started to take medication. Her mother said she thought things began to get better and was planning fundraising events for the summer and told her mother she would download Skype so they could talk more. Investigation: Authorities have not yet suggested why the father and his daughter jumped from the bridge . 'She didnâ€™t seem to be in that state of . mind, not when sheâ€™s texting about doing something that she thought . would be so fun,' the mother said. 'There's no note. No nothing. I'm . lost.' Authorities called off the search for the pair hours after they were seen jumping from the Bond Bridge at 11.35 a.m. on Thursday. Witnesses said they saw the two people get out of their truck, climb over the railing on the bridge and jump to the water 120 feet below, the Kansas City Star reported. Police say the woman was holding . something in a blanket that initially was thought to be a baby but more . likely was the family's Chihuahua-mix, named Skeeter. Scene: They reportedly parked their car and climbed over the railing at the Bond Bridge in Kansas City . Authorities were granted a search . warrant for the vehicle on Thursday night but found nothing inside apart . from the father's cellphone. The truck was towed by police. Emergency workers scoured the river by boats for more than an hour, while the Kansas City Fire Department put spotters on the Chouteau Bridge and at Interstate 435 for a view over the river. The Missouri Highway Patrol estimated the water's temperature was in the 40s, but Jeff Grote from the Kansas City Fire Department said people are less likely to drown in cold water than warm water. But a fire spokesman told FOX 4 that when someone jumps off a bridge, they typically do not resurface and tend to travel for miles under water before resurfacing.","Father and daughter jumped from Bond Bridge in Missouri on Thursday .

More than 200 people helped fashion the one-tonne log boat over a three-week period from a section of fallen 80ft oak tree. The 15ft vessel is a scaled down copy of a 35ft Iron Age log boat discovered at the bottom of Poole Harbour almost 50 years ago. The National Trust has constructed a 2,300-year-old Celtic log boat over the course of three weeks in tribute to the one discovered in Poole harbour in 1964 . The original boat, discovered in 1964, was discovered after routine dredging work but it is now only display at Poole Museum. Visitors to Brownsea Island, the largest of eight islands in Poole Harbour, helped shape the flat-fronted boat using an adze, an ancient axe-like tool used for wood carving. Two 4ft paddles were sculpted from the same piece of timber as the boat. For years it was kept submerged in fresh water to help preserve and protect it, but experts feared it could disintegrate. The original Bronze age boat is preserved with sugar in Poole museum. Thought to date back to 300BC, it was accidentally uncovered in during dredging work in Poole Harbour . Historians spent many painstaking hours on the Brownsea island oak tree to convert it into an ancient logboat. They used an adze, an ancient axe-like tool used for wood carving, to make to boat more authentic . The original boat is thought to have been built by the Durotriges, an ancient Celtic tribe that inhabited Dorset, to navigate Poole Harbour's 14 square miles of water . The Bronze Age in Britain spanned from 2,500BC to 800BC. It is generally thought that the new bronze tools and weapons identified with this age were brought over from continental Europe. The skulls recovered from burial sites in Britain from the Bronze Age are different in shape from Stone Age skulls. This would suggest that new ideas and new blood were brought over from the continent. Stone and bronze can be used together, subject to the availability of both materials. True bronze is a combination of 10% tin and 90% copper. Both materials were readily available in Britain at this time.Before its entry into Britain, the Bronze Age was in full swing in Europe. The island of Crete was centre for the expansion of the bronze trade to Europe. The Mycenaeans created the finest bronze weapons. In 1995 the ancient boat was soaked in ten tonnes of sugar solution, where it remained for five years.It went on show in Poole Museum in 2007. The . original boat is thought to have been built by the Durotriges, an . ancient Celtic tribe that inhabited Dorset, to navigate Poole Harbour's . 14 square miles of water. Its replica will now go on display at Brownsea Island. Reuben Hawkwood, the island's head ranger, said: 'The idea of building a log boat had been suggested a few times and then one day a huge oak tree was blown down. 'It all came together and we thought it would be a fun, interesting and relevant project. 'We cut the log to size and then enlisted the help of staff, volunteers and around 200 visitors to chip away at the log. 'It . took three solid weeks to make.

Canada has removed all anti-prostitution laws after sex workers fought for safer working conditions following the serial killings of prostitutes by a pig farmer in British Columbia. The 9-0 Supreme Court ruling found that the laws violated the guarantee to life, liberty and security of the person but it will not take effect immediately because Parliament has a one-year reprieve to respond with new legislation. Prostitution isn't illegal in Canada, but many of the activities associated with prostitution are classified as criminal offenses. Scroll down for video . Cracking the whip: Dominatrix Terri-Jean Bedford was one of three plaintiffs in the case pushing for the decriminalization of certain activities associated with prostitution like running a brothel . Concern: Sex workers felt that by banning the likes of street solicitation, their health and safety was at risk . The high court struck down all three prostitution-related laws: against keeping a brothel, living on the avails of prostitution, and street soliciting. The landmark ruling comes more than two decades after the Supreme Court last upheld the country's anti-prostitution laws. The decision upheld an Ontario Court of Appeal ruling last year that struck down the ban on brothels on the grounds that it endangered sex workers by forcing them onto the streets. Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, writing on behalf of the court, said Canada's social landscape has changed since 1990, when the Supreme Court upheld a ban on street solicitation. 'These appeals and the cross-appeal are not about whether prostitution should be legal or not,' she wrote. 'They are about whether the laws Parliament has enacted on how prostitution may be carried out pass constitutional muster. I conclude that they do not.' Happy day: Valerie Scott (center) is a former sex worker who helped push for the change in laws after six prostitutes were found dead on a pig farm that belonged to a serial killer . A Vancouver sex worker who was part of a group that brought the case applauded the court's decision. 'I'm shocked and pleased that our sex laws will not cause us harm in a year,' Amy Lebovitch said in a news conference. Katrina Pacey, a lawyer for the group, called it 'an unbelievably important day for the sex workers but also for human rights.' 'The court recognized that sex workers have the right to protect themselves and their safety,' she said. Sex-trade workers argued that much has happened since the high court last considered prostitution, including the serial killings of prostitutes by Robert Pickton in British Columbia. Pickton was convicted in 2007 of killing six women whose remains were found on his farm outside Vancouver. In 1990, the two women on Canada's Supreme Court dissented on the ruling upholding the ban on street solicitation. This time, all six men on the court justices sided with their three female colleagues. Now and then: Scott (left) and Bedford (right) are both retired but the change in legislation will effect current sex workers like Amy Lebovitch (center) when it goes into effect next year . Peace of mind: Scott and Lebovitch hug after the ruling was announced, which cited sex workers' right to life, liberty and security of the person . 'The harms identified by the courts below are grossly disproportionate to the deterrence of community disruption that is the object of the law,' McLachlin wrote. 'Parliament has the power to regulate against nuisances, but not at the cost of the health, safety and lives of prostitutes.' The Supreme Court appeared to acknowledge the Pickton case in the ruling, saying: 'A law that prevents street prostitutes from resorting to a safe haven such as Grandma's House while a suspected serial killer prowls the streets, is a law that has lost sight of its purpose.' Grandma's House was a safe house established to support street workers in Vancouver's drug and violence-riddled Downtown Eastside, at about the same time as fears were growing that a serial killer was prowling the streets. The Supreme Court also struck down the law that makes living off the avails of prostitution illegal, rejecting the Ontario government's argument that it is designed 'to target the commercialization of prostitution and to promote the values of dignity and equality.' The three principles in the case are: Lebovitch, retired dominatrix Terri-Jean Bedford and former prostitute Valerie Scott, of Toronto. Parliament could ask the Supreme Court for an extension on the effect of the ruling, if it has tabled legislation but can't meet the one-year deadline. The ruling told Parliament it needs to reshape the legal framework around prostitution.","Prostitution was already legal in Canada but a number of related laws attempted to curb the practice .

It comes just days after pictures emerged of him clapping, singing and dancing bizarrely in front of a gospel congregation at the predominantly black West Toronto Church of God, where one churchgoer remarked that he ‘smells like ganja’. The mayor looked far happier dancing in the council chamber than he did during the past few weeks when he has had to field questions . from journalists about his drug and drink-fuelled antics. Hallelujah: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford (far right) was filmed dancing bizarrely in front of a congregation at the West Toronto Church . The controversial 44-year-old has been plagued by a string of damaging stories since video emerged of him smoking a crack pipe. This week he insisted he did not intend . to suggest during a television interview that a Toronto Star reporter . is a pedophile, but the journalist rejected the apology and said he . would proceed with a defamation lawsuit. Ford . said it is 'unfortunate that the word I did not say has been ascribed . to me by the media but I wish to sincerely apologize.' Reporter Daniel Dale served Ford with a libel notice last week, demanding Ford apologize.

Ford has rebuffed intense pressure to resign over his admitted crack use and revelations of other erratic behavior. The Toronto City Council has stripped him of most of his powers in an attempt to sideline him but the conservative mayor has vowed to seek re-election next year. The bombastic mayor has not shied from the limelight. During a council session Tuesday, Ford danced vigorously to a band playing 'One Love' on the chamber floor - around the same time that Dale was sending his Twitter messages. Red faced: For once it wasn't the embarrassing revelations which left Rob Ford blushing, it was his enthusiastic dancing . Ford has said he has quit drinking alcohol and is exercising daily after having a 'come to Jesus moment.' His lawyer, Dennis Morris, said Ford has lost 26lbs in the last five weeks. The mayor weighed himself in his office Tuesday and found he was down to 310lbs said Morris, who was at City Hall to pick up some bobblehead dolls of Ford to give as Christmas gifts. The mayor has signed some of the bobbleheads for charity. Ford has taken pointed shots at the media, calling journalists maggots. Allegations about Ford smoking crack surfaced in May when two reporters for the Toronto Star and one from the U.S. website Gawker said they saw a video of Ford appearing to smoke from a crack pipe, but they did not obtain a copy. Ford vilified the Star, accusing the paper of trying to take him down. Ford first denied the tape existed but later when Toronto police announced in October they had obtained a copy, the mayor admitted he had smoked the drug. Ford lashed out at Dale's bosses at the Toronto Star on Tuesday, saying they put him and Dale in this situation . Toronto City Councilor Shelley Carroll called Ford's apology 'insincere.' 'He's an expert at non apologies. He's been doing it for years. A real apology is `I caused you harm Daniel, I am sorry for that,' Carroll said.

Hostages: Journalist Judith Spiegel and her partner Boudewijn Berendsen were seized at the start of June as they left their home in the Hadda district of the Yemeni capital Sana'a . 'Now there's another 10 days to do something. These people are armed. If no solution is found after 10 days, they'll shoot us dead,' Spiegel, speaking in Dutch, says in a trembling voice. She did not say how the couple had contacted the ambassador or what the kidnappers had demanded to secure their release. Her partner, Boudewijn Berendsen, said they were afraid. 'Everyone in the Netherlands should get the government and the ambassador into action,' he said, seated beside her. The Dutch embassy in Sanaa referred questions to the foreign ministry in The Hague, where no officials could be reached. A Yemeni police source said last month that Spiegel, who had been working in Yemen as a researcher, vanished with her partner after they left their home in Sanaa's Hadda district, which houses many diplomatic missions. No one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Threat: The couple say they will be shot in ten days if their captors' demands are not met.

On road to freedom: Russia's former richest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky is set to be pardoned by Vladimir Putin after ten years in jail . President Vladimir Putin says he will pardon one of his best-known opponents, the jailed oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Putin made the announcement that he would soon free Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, after a marathon news conference in which he exuded confidence that he has reasserted his authority in the face of street protests. He also confirmed that women from the Pussy Riot group would be also be released. But he remained firm on Russia's response to a Greenpeace protest over Arctic oil drilling which he said should serve as a lesson even though all charges against them look set to be dropped under a new amnesty bill. He insisted that Moscow would toughen steps to guard against interference in its development of the region. Khodorkovsky, 50, spectacularly fell . out with Putin a decade ago and had his Yukos oil company dissolved . following his arrest on fraud and tax evasion charges in 2003. He . became Putin's nemesis, a symbol of what investors say is the Kremlin's . abuse of the courts for political ends - and share prices rose in . Moscow on the news he would be pardoned. Putin . has long singled out Khodorkovsky, who would be due for release in . August, for bitter personal attacks, once saying that 'a thief should . sit in jail'. On Thursday, he said: 'He has been in jail already more than 10 years. This is a serious punishment.' Saying . that Khodorkovsky's mother was ill, he added: 'I decided that, with . these circumstances in mind, we should make a decision to pardon him.' Russian stocks rose by 1.3 per cent after Putin's comment, even though his lawyers and mother said he had not asked for a pardon. One of the lawyers said, however, that Putin did not need a pardon request to release him from prison. Sympathetic: Russian President Vladimir Putin discusses his decision to pardon his political nemesis in part because of his mother's ill health - a move which caused share prices to rise . Khodorkovsky (pictured being escorted into court in 2011) spectacularly fell out with Putin a decade ago and had his oil company dissolved following his arrest on fraud and tax evasion charges in 2003 . Vladimir Putin today made the controversial claim that there was no difference between 'dictators' Josef Stalin and Oliver Cromwell. The Kremlin leader was commenting on plans to restore statues of the Soviet tyrant and other Communist leaders more than two decades after they were toppled. One contentious plan backed by Russian hardliners would see monuments to Stalin and the feared founder of the Soviet secret services Felix Dzerzhinsky brought back in Moscow, moves which Putin likened to the monument to Cromwell outside the Houses of Parliament. 'How in particular is Cromwell so different from Stalin? Can you tell me? Not in any way at all,' he said. 'From the point of view of liberals, he is the same bloody dictator.' Of Cromwell - a soldier and statesman who signed Charles I's death warrant before becoming England's Protector  - he said: 'He was quite a treacherous dude, one has to say.' Investors had long seen the treatment of a man who built a business empire on the ruins of Soviet communism as evidence of the weakness of property rights and the rule of law in Russia. Supporters say Khodorkovsky was jailed to curb a political challenge to Putin, bring his oil assets under state control and send a signal to other wealthy 'oligarchs' to toe the line. His assets were sold off, mainly into state hands. In the eyes of Kremlin critics at home and abroad, Khodorkovsky's jailing is one of the biggest stains on the record of Putin, who was first elected president in 2000 and has not ruled out seeking another six-year term in 2018. Khodorkovsky's mother, Marina, who will turn 80 next year, said she had just heard the reports and was unaware of a request for a pardon. 'I want to believe he will pardon him,' she told Reuters. 'I want to believe Putin is not totally lost.' Khodorkovsky is due for release in August. But . he has previously had his jail term extended on other charges and . analysts have said Putin would allow Khodorkovsky to walk free only if . he no longer regarded him as a political threat. Freeing Khodorkovsky and the two women . from Pussy Riot, jailed over a profanity-laced protest against Putin in a . Russian Orthodox Church, could ease criticism of the president before . the Sochi Olympics in February. Rivals: Putin has long singled out Khodorkovsky, who would be due for release in August, for bitter personal attacks, once saying that 'a thief should sit in jail' He has staked a great deal of personal prestige on the Games, and is under fire over a law banning the spread of 'anti-gay propaganda' among minors. Meanwhile, Putin suggested Greenpeace . activists detained for a protest at a drilling platform operated by . state-controlled Gazprom in September may have been carrying out an . order to undermine Russia's development of Arctic energy resources. 'Why . was this (protest) carried out? Either it was to put pressure on a . company or on someone's orders interfere with Russia's offshore . development,' Putin said, suggesting foreign rivals could have been . behind it but naming no nation. 'This is a serious thing for us. And we do not plan to soften (our stance), we will only be toughening it.' New law: British Greenpeace activist Alexandra Harris, from Exeter, pictured in court in Saint Petersburg, may finally be able to return home after a new law could see her charges for hooliganism dropped . Released: Anthony Perrett, from Newport in South Wales, was arrested by Russian authorities during a Greenpeace protest in the Arctic - he was freed on bail after spending two months in detention . Russia's treatment of the 30 activists from 18 countries, has drawn criticism from Western nations and a number of global celebrities. The 30 were held in custody for two months and face up to seven years in prison if tried and convicted. Speaking at an annual news conference, Putin said an amnesty passed this week that lawyers say will enable the Greenpeace activists to avoid trial and return home was not drafted with them in mind. 'As for the fact that they can now get amnesty... we are not doing this for them,' Putin said. 'What happened must be a lesson and should, I hope, dispose us, with Greenpeace, to working positively together.'","Russia's former richest man found guilty of tax evasion and fraud .

Ian Learmonth and Ann Barnes are accused of keeping complaints into police's handling of the case quiet . Police chiefs have been accused of a cover-up as one of Britain’s most senior officers prepares to retire while secretly being investigated over an alleged conflict of interest. Ian Learmonth, chief constable of Kent, was reported to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) in July over a review of the police inquiry into the death of Lee Balkwell, who was found dead in a cement mixer lorry in 2002. Mr Learmonth faces criticism for letting his officers in Kent investigate how Essex Police handled the case because he himself was working for the Essex force at the time of the original inquiry. Neither Kent Police nor the force’s elected crime tsar, Ann Barnes, who referred the case to the IPCC, have made the complaint – by Mr Balkwell’s father, Les – public. Mr Learmonth announced he was retiring in October and will step down on January 3, before the probe begins. Les Balkwell, who has campaigned relentlessly for justice for his son, said: ‘I made my complaint in June and, six months later, Ann Barnes has not even found an outside force to take on the investigation. ‘I am not surprised to see more attempts to cover up the truth about my son’s death. Mr Learmonth has questions to answer about his role in Essex. 'He should not have been allowed to retire.’ Lee Balkwell, 33, was working as a cement mixer driver for Upminster Concrete when his body was discovered in July 2002 stuck between the drum and chassis of a mixer lorry on an Essex farm. Despite suspicions of foul play, the death was ruled a ‘tragic accident’ by Essex Police. In 2010, after a series of reviews, it was announced that Kent Police would look into the case. Last year, the IPCC ruled that the original inquiry by Essex Police was ‘seriously flawed’, and in March Lee’s body was exhumed by detectives. Lee Balkwell (left) was found dead in a cement mixer in 2002. Last month his boss Simon Bromley (right) was charged with manslaughter . Last month, company boss Simon Bromley was charged with manslaughter. Earlier this year, Mr Balkwell discovered Mr Learmonth had been assistant chief constable at Essex in late 2002, at the time of the original inquiry. Mr Balkwell then wrote to Mrs Barnes, Kent’s police and crime commissioner, to complain. On July 1, Mrs Barnes’s office referred the complaint to the IPCC, but this decision was not made public. The IPCC told Mrs Barnes that an investigation had to be carried out, but did not specify by whom. The complaint was initially resolved locally. In early October, Mr Learmonth announced his retirement, but again no mention was made of the complaint. Mr Balkwell appealed against the dismissal of his complaint, and this was upheld by the IPCC, which ruled his concern had to be looked at externally. Earlier this month, Mrs Barnes’s office wrote to Mr Balkwell to inform him Mr Learmonth’s involvement would be considered by a senior officer ‘ from outside of Kent and Essex’. Again, this decision was not made public. Mrs Barnes posted a photograph of herself with Mr Learmonth and his retirement cake, in the shape of a police helmet, on Twitter last week.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel today hailed a role played 'behind the scenes' by former German foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher in helping to secure the release of Kremlin critic and Russian ex-oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky. 'The German government appreciates the efforts of former federal minister Genscher who worked intensively on the case behind the scenes,' Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement. 'He worked successfully on possibilities for a solution with a great level of commitment and the support of the chancellor and the foreign ministry.' Genscher, 86, said in a statement he had decided to support Khodorkovsky's case 'for humanitarian reasons' having met him several times in the past. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Political prisoner: A police officer guards the road in front of the Penal Colony 7, where Mikhail Khodorkovsky was released from in the village of Segezha near the Finnish border . Genscher, who served as Germany's top . diplomat from 1974 to 1992, said he welcomed the pardon by Russian . President Vladimir Putin, whom he said he had met twice to discuss the . Khodorkovsky case, saying in a statement that the decision was . 'significant and encouraging for other cases'. He . also thanked Merkel, a fellow German former foreign minister and the . German ambassador in Moscow for lending 'the greatest possible support' to his efforts. Genscher, . who arranged the flight on a private jet from Russia and picked . Khodorkovsky up at the airport in Berlin, told news website Spiegel . Online that Khodorkovsky was doing well under the circumstances. 'He . is exhausted but very happy to finally be free,' he said by telephone, . adding that Khodorkovsky now wanted to rest and would stay out of the . public eye. Spiegel said Khodorkovsky could be heard in the background talking to friends and relatives by phone. It said he had received a visa that would allow him to stay for one year in the Schengen passport-free zone. An Emergency Situations Ministry helicopter takes off near the prison where Khodorkovsky was being held .

It is not known if he left in this helicopter . Activity: Emergency Situations Ministry officers move a stretcher near an ambulance, although it is not clear if this was linked to the release of Khodorkovsky . Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service . said in a statement that Khodorkovsky had petitioned to be allowed to . travel to Germany to meet his mother who is reportedly being treated for . cancer. In his 10 years in . prison on politically tinged charges of tax evasion and embezzlement, . 50-year-old Khodorkovsky turned from a powerful oligarch into a . respected dissident, becoming a political thinker who argued for social . justice and placed the blame on Mr Putin for Russia's stagnating . economy. It wasn't clear whether Khodorkovsky would continue his opposition to the Kremlin. Mr Putin's announcement less than 24 . hours before that Khodorkovsky would be pardoned appeared to catch both . the public and Khodorkovsky's lawyers by surprise. His . release was equally shrouded in mystery. Several hours before, . Khodorkovsky's lawyers and family said they still had no idea when he . would be let out. Reunion: The Russian prison service said Khodorkovsky was on his way to Germany where his cancer-stricken mother Marina Khodorkovskaya (right), who is undergoing medical treatment . Compassionate grounds: Vladimir Putin said that Russia's most famous prisoner had asked for clemency on humanitarian grounds as his mother was ill . Khodorkovsky's . father, Boris, speaking on the phone from the Moscow region said he and . his wife, are in Moscow and are going to fly to Germany on Saturday. Khodorkovsky's . second wife and three children live in the Moscow region. His eldest . son from the first marriage lives with his family in New York City. In a shock remark after his annual . marathon news conference yesterday, Putin had said that Russia's most . famous prisoner had asked for clemency on humanitarian grounds as his . mother was ill. The Kremlin followed with a swift announcement today that Putin had already signed the pardon decree. 'Guided . by humanitarian principles, I decree that Mikhail Borisovich . Khodorkovsky... should be pardoned and freed from any further punishment . in the form of imprisonment. 'This decree comes into force from the day of its signing,' said the decree signed by Putin and published by the Kremlin. Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev were convicted of fraud and tax evasion in 2005. Intense atmosphere: Putin pictured during a meeting with Khodorkovsky in 2002, a year before the oil tycoon was snatched off his corporate plane in 2003 soon after Putin warned oligarchs against meddling in politics . Vladimir Putin made the controversial claim that there was no difference between 'dictators' Josef Stalin and Oliver Cromwell. The Kremlin leader was commenting on plans to restore statues of the Soviet tyrant and other Communist leaders more than two decades after they were toppled. One contentious plan backed by Russian hardliners would see monuments to Stalin and the feared founder of the Soviet secret services Felix Dzerzhinsky brought back in Moscow, moves which Putin likened to the monument to Cromwell outside the Houses of Parliament. 'How in particular is Cromwell so different from Stalin? Can you tell me? Not in any way at all,' he said. 'From the point of view of liberals, he is the same bloody dictator.' Of Cromwell - a soldier and statesman who signed Charles I's death warrant before becoming England's Protector  - he said: 'He was quite a treacherous dude, one has to say.' Khodorkovsky was then convicted of embezzlement in a second . trial in 2010 and had been due for release in August. It . remained unclear exactly when the 50-year-old would be freed from his . prison colony in the town of Segezha in the Karelia region of . northwestern Russia. The circumstances of the pardon also remained murky. The . former chief of Yukos oil company, once Russia's richest man, had . repeatedly said he would not ask Putin for a pardon because it would be . tantamount to admitting guilt. The Kommersant broadsheet, citing . unnamed sources, said on Friday Khodorkovsky had made the decision to . seek a pardon after a recent meeting with representatives of Russia's . security services, who had raised the menace of a third trial against . him. Members of the security . services met with Khodorkovsky over the last several days, told him the . health of his cancer-stricken mother Marina, 79, was worsening and . warned him about a possible third criminal case against him. 'This . conversation, which was conducted without lawyers, forced Mikhail . Khodorkovsky to turn to the president,' said the newspaper. Economists and political analysts put the . announcement down to the Kremlin's bid to improve its dismal rights . record and international image ahead of the Winter Olympic Games that . Russia is hosting in Sochi in February. Khodorkovsky had been due to be . released in August 2014 but Russian prosecutors earlier this month . raised the threat of a third trial for the former tycoon on . money-laundering charges. Putin told reporters on Thursday that he saw no prospects for the third case. Economists and political analysts said that while . Khodorkovsky's imminent release was a watershed moment it would not . dramatically change Russia's battered investment climate or . international image. Rivals: Putin has long singled out Khodorkovsky, who would be due for release in August, for bitter personal attacks, once saying that 'a thief should sit in jail' 'It is a . very important signal,' said prominent economist Sergei Guriev, who . co-authored a critical report on Khodorkovsky's second conviction in . 2010. 'In and of itself it will not change anything but it will give hope to investors,' Guriev told AFP in e-mailed comments. He said, however, that Putin's promise to release Khodorkovsky was not enough to make him return to Russia. Earlier . this year, Guriev had fled to France after coming under pressure from . investigators for his role in the Khodorkovsky report. The . Eurasia Group consultancy said the former tycoon's release was a 'charm . offensive' ahead of the Sochi Olympics amid reports that heads of major . states like Barack Obama of the United States and France's Francois . Hollande will not be in attendance. Political enemy: Supporters have said that Khodorkovsky (pictured when he CEO of Yukos oil company in 2001) had been thrown into jail after two trials for daring to finance opposition to the Russian strongman . Vedomosti business daily compared the announcement to a 'a trump card' Putin pulled out of his sleeve at a critical moment. 'Khodorkovsky . personally no longer presents a threat to the system,' it said, noting . that his release would not 'heal the wounds inflicted on the economy and . society 10 years ago.' 'Investments . will not return, businesses that were closed down or were never created . will not be born again, those who emigrated will not come back,' said . Vedomosti.

"By . Martin Beckford . PUBLISHED: . 17:03 EST, 21 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:03 EST, 21 December 2013 . A British woman with the mental age of a child was forced to marry a Pakistani immigrant and have his baby so that he could gain the right to live in Britain. A secret court heard that the 37-year-old, who has a reading age of seven, was slapped around the face by her mother to make her smile for her wedding photograph. The judge’s ruling, seen by The Mail on Sunday, reveals that fears were raised she was being ‘manipulated’ and her parents were being paid £20,000 to marry off their daughter to the Muslim student, who was facing deportation. Judgment: A British woman with the mental age of a child was forced to marry a Pakistani immigrant and have his baby so that he could gain the right to live in Britain, the court of protection was told . But despite concerns, registrars allowed the ceremony to go ahead and the woman’s husband, 33, is now using his human right to a family life as a reason to remain in the UK, despite the ‘grossly cruel’ ploy. The case came to light in the Court of Protection – which has the power to make life-or-death decisions on behalf of people deemed to lack mental capacity – and can be revealed today after an anonymised judgment was published. The judge in the case, Mrs Justice Parker, said: ‘I think there is a very significant possibility that this marriage was entered into, and indeed this child created, for reasons solely to do with immigration status.’ She added: ‘To put an incapacitated person in a position whereby she bears a child which she cannot look after is grossly cruel.’ The case has lifted the lid on the grim exploitation of people with severe mental health problems who are being ‘groomed’ and then forced into marriage for passports, money or free care. 'Grossly cruel': The court was told that the British woman had been married and divorced twice before. (Picture posed by model) Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘To force anyone into  marriage without their consent or the capacity to consent is wrong and is a serious abuse of human rights.’ The court was told that the British woman, who had been a Sikh but later converted to Islam, had been married and divorced twice before. In 2011, she entered into a Muslim marriage with the man from Lahore, who was facing deportation after his student visa ran out and an appeal was rejected. She became pregnant ‘almost immediately’ and the following year they were about to have a civil wedding in a register office when social services tried to stop the ceremony. The UK Border Agency was also informed by registrars of suspicions that there was ‘money changing hands’ and the husband’s immigration status was the reason for the wedding. Registrars also said the woman was ‘confused about her husband’s name’ and spoke in a  ‘simplistic way’. The judge said ‘an anonymous informant’ had telephoned the register office to state that the woman’s father ‘had received £20,000 in consideration of the marriage’, but the judge added this was ‘hearsay’ and she could not establish if it was true. The woman’s family produced an opinion from a local doctor claiming that she did understand what marriage meant, but the judge said he ‘may have had some connection with the family’ and the doctor is now under investigation by a medical watchdog over the report. A senior registrar was ‘concerned about being seen not to have taken into account the cultural background and [the woman’s] right to marry and found a family’, according to the judge, so the ceremony was allowed to go ahead in February 2012.  During the event, the woman’s mother ‘slapped her on the face to get her to smile for a photograph’ and the registrar was ‘worried about her demeanour’. Mrs Justice Parker said it was  ‘difficult for me to be clear’ why the wedding was allowed to go ahead. She called for registrars to be given better guidance on how to spot the signs of people with learning disabilities being forced into marriage. The General Register Office is now considering the request. The couple went on to have a baby boy but social workers had to become involved as the mother  cannot look after him safely, the court heard. Carers who have lived with them painted a ‘worrying picture’ in which the husband is distant from his wife, rarely speaks to her and ‘walks ahead of her with the baby in his arms’. 'In reality another child': Mrs Justice Parker ruled that the woman in the case could not consent to sex, marriage or where she lived . The man told the court he now wants to be rehoused in a two-bedroom flat, with social workers visiting for two hours every morning and evening so he can ‘go to the mosque and also to pray at home’. ‘I was left with a very strong doubt as to what his true commitment and ability was to providing full-time seven-day care to the baby,’ the judge said. Mrs Justice Parker added the woman was ‘being used’ and was ‘in reality another child’. Last year, the woman suffered a broken jaw, supposedly by yawning, but the judge said that this was ‘most unlikely’. After the judge’s ruling that the woman could not consent to sex, marriage or where she lived, the husband and the baby are likely to be rehoused separately by the council. The couple’s marriage has not been annulled, nor have divorce proceedings begun, but the judge said that in the husband’s view ‘all pretence this is or could be a functioning marriage has now evaporated’. A total of 114 people with disabilities were helped by the Government’s Forced Marriage Unit last year, but it is feared this is just the tip of the iceberg. A new law is to make forced marriage illegal but cases involving people with learning disabilities rarely come to light, because the victims may be unable or unwilling to report the abuse. Human rights activist Mandy Sanghera said: ‘Forced marriage of people with learning disabilities is often hidden. We need to be clear about protection – we can’t let political correctness and cultural sensitivities get in the way of this.’ Although the judge ordered that none of those involved can be named to preserve the anonymity of the woman, in other cases the parties have been identified. Critics said it meant the registrars, who faced criticism for not stopping the wedding, could not be held to account.","Court of Protection hears bride was ‘confused about her husband’s name’

Macabre yet strikingly beautiful images of skeleton couples have been produced by two Japanese art students. Saiko Kanda and Mayuka Hayashi used a CT scanner and X-ray machine to photograph four couples in intimate embraces - but the results are not in the least bit cuddly. While the photographs might be a simple extension of medical X-rays, they paint an intimate yet eerie picture of human relationships. Saiko Kanda and Mayuka Hayashi used a CT scan and X-ray machine to photograph four couples . The students, from Musashino Art University, Japan, said: ‘X-ray images usually show the finite nature of our bodies composed only of matter.’ ‘But these couples' portraits reveal a pulse that isn’t normally seen.’ The duo won a prize in the recent Mitsubishi Chemical Junior Designer Awards for their stark compositions according to Japanese art and culture blog, Spoon & Tamago. They explained on the Mitsubishi Chemical awards website that they wanted to ‘eliminate the information of two people,’ and get to the bare bones of a relationship, highlighting the 'pulse' between a couple. While the photographs might be a simple extension of medical X-rays, they paint an intimate but eerie picture of human relationships. The students chose to use X-rays to create their art as they show the 'finite nature of our bodies' The artists didn't want to dwell on sentiment like more traditional portraits. Many couple-centred photographs focus on the way two lovers look at each other,but in this new installation, they concentrated solely on the position of the bodies. While the pair are not the first to exploit X-ray machines for art they were interested in the way bones ‘overlap’ between the two transparent bodies. The artists added that the images manage to be both familiar and unusual and are perhaps  compelling because they strip away all the individual characteristics of couples to dwell on the mechanics of the human body.","Two art students from Musashino Art University, Japan, used an X-ray machine and a CT scanner to create their artworks .

Former BBC director-general Mark Thompson is at the centre of a new cronyism row following the release of a bombshell document about the ‘Crowngate’ affair. The secret internal briefing note, written in the wake of a £500,000 payoff to ex-BBC1 controller Peter Fincham, last night prompted one Tory MP to accuse Mr Thompson of giving potentially misleading evidence to a Commons committee. The document, marked ‘strictly private and confidential’, details the background to Mr Fincham’s dismissal, which came after he inaccurately stated that the Queen had walked out of a photoshoot featured in a Royal documentary ‘in a huff’. Former BBC director general Mark Thompson is at the centre of a new cronyism row . It later emerged that a promotional trailer for the programme had been misleadingly edited. Mr Fincham agreed to leave in the wake of the 2007 row – but still walked away with a half-million pound ‘golden goodbye’. When Mr Thompson appeared before the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in September, he was asked if such ‘eye-watering’ payoffs were part of a ‘culture of extravagance’ at the BBC. Asked about the specific payment to Mr Fincham, Mr Thompson said he had left as part of a ‘consensual termination’, adding: ‘We were going through a difficult negotiation, a lawyer-to-lawyer negotiation.’ The secret note sent about the payoff which has been seen by the Mail on Sunday . However, the newly released document suggests that Mr Thompson played a much more direct role in setting the size of the payoff. The briefing – prepared earlier this year for the current BBC director-general Lord Hall – states: ‘There is no documented approval for the payment; it is understood that Mark Thompson gave verbal instructions to the BBC legal team.’ The note goes on to say: ‘The lawyer who constructed the compromise agreement is no longer with the BBC; however, a team member recalls the lawyer saying that Mark Thompson gave verbal instructions to her as she drafted the compromise agreement.’ The document concludes: ‘It is essential that this note is kept strictly confidential and is not shared with anyone.’ Peter Fincham (right) agreed to leave his post after a promotional trailer for a royal documentary included misleadingly edited footage of The Queen (left) Tory MP Rob Wilson, who has waged a long campaign to force the BBC to release the document under Freedom of Information rules, has written to the Labour chairman of the PAC to question Mr Thompson’s  evidence to the committee. ‘I would like to draw your attention to the possibility that the PAC was potentially misled,’ he writes. ‘The BBC’s internal account paints a very different picture to that presented to your committee by Mr Thompson. Far from the outcome of the payoff being essentially the result of negotiations between  lawyers which the BBC was obliged to accept, the lawyer who drafted the compromise agreement which included the payoff was in fact taking her instructions directly from Mr Thompson himself.’ Mr Wilson added that this showed ‘the practice of granting payoffs at the top of the BBC in recent years owed more to a culture of cronyism than standards of good practice’, and that ‘Mr Thompson’s suggested behaviour was inappropriate’. A spokesman for Mr Thompson did not return calls last night. Top BBC executives are spending tens of thousands of pounds  of licence fee-payers’ money  on ‘champagne and seabass’  meals with each other at  exclusive restaurants. The lunches and dinners – described in BBC accounts as ‘editorial meetings’ – contributed  to a total inter-executive wining and dining bill of more than  £30,000 last year. One £155,000-a-year executive has managed to notch up a personal dining tally of more than £11,000 over the past four years. Gweneth Williams enjoyed glasses of champagne, salmon and seabass . According to documents and receipts released by the BBC, there were 269 claims for executives dining with each other last year, which amounts to more than one for every working day. Each claim cost more than £100 on average. The biggest claimant was  David Holdsworth, the controller of English regions, who has spent £11,050 on wining and dining since 2010. The second most lavish spender was Peter Johnston, the £152,000-a-year director of BBC Northern Ireland, who spent £5,185, while Roger Wright, the £227,000-a-year controller of Radio 3, spent £4,758. Receipts from some of these ‘meetings’ show how convivial they can be. Gwyneth Williams, the £183,000-a-year controller of Radio 4, enjoyed glasses of Champagne Billecart-Salmon, chablis and seabass at an ‘editorial/leaving lunch’ in May 2012 with Mary Kalemkerian, the former head of programming for Radio 4. Ben Gale, the former head of Bristol Factual, billed £79.45 for a ‘programme development meeting’ at a Bristol restaurant which included a 31-day dry-aged fillet steak – served on a lava rock heated to 500F – costing more than £28 with a sauce. And another meeting, between Ken MacQuarrie and Rhodri Talfan-Davies, the heads of BBC Scotland and Wales, was held at the Royal Dragon in Soho, Central London, where they  enjoyed the Peking set dinner and six Asahi beers. The executives dined out at the restaurants even though they can choose from 166 meeting rooms at New Broadcasting House.

Figures show that since 2010, the ‘internal hospitality’ spend by top executives has risen from £19,181 to £30,350 –  an average of £1,017 a year for those who submitted claims. The executives also received another perk: the BBC spent a total of £7.8 million on paying tax bills incurred by employees on perks such as taxis and meals. Last night, a BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC employs 20,000 people and this expenditure, released under our disclosure rules, equates to £1.50 per person, per year. ‘Like many other UK businesses, the BBC pays tax on certain taxable benefits, such as the cost  of ensuring staff can travel home safely late at night.’","Ex-BBC 1 controller accused of providing misleading evidence .

One in three homeless Big Issue sellers are now from eastern Europe, the founder has revealed. John Bird, himself a former offender who lived on the streets, set up the publication in 1991 to help homeless people earn some money from selling the magazine. But Mr Bird has revealed that less and less British people are now living rough and a third of vendors are now migrants from poorer European countries. Statistics: One in three Big Issue homeless vendors are now from eastern European countries . Of those, he said the majority are from Roma communities who are escaping lives of 'feral poverty' in their own countries. But Mr Bird added that the Big Issue is still vital for helping the homeless make an income - wherever they may be from. He told The Sunday Times: 'Don't slag The Big Issue off because we are working with east Europeans. First-hand experience: Big Issue founder John Bird was once a former offender who lived on the streets . 'What would you have them do? You are not going to offer them a legal job. Take the attitude the police have: thank God you have offered people who might have got into trouble the legal means to make money.' Mr Bird also said he raised concerns when the Labour government first decided to open up freedom of movement in the UK to residents of other EU countries. 'I said, ""Don't open the sluice gates to the ferally poor — go to their countries and help them earn their way into an economy which is more equal"". But I was accused of being a fascist.' Mr Bird's comments come as Nick Clegg has pledged to block any fresh attempts to curb immigration from the European Union. The Deputy Prime Minister dismissed Home Office proposals for a 75,000 cap on EU migrants as 'pointless' and claimed without freedom of movement the National Health Service would 'fall over'. His statement follows David Cameron's warning just a few days ago, that he would veto further expansion of the union's borders unless reforms were agreed to crack down on 'benefit tourism'. A ban on EU migrants claiming out-of-work benefits from the moment they arrive in the UK is also being rushed through Parliament to be in place in time for the January 1 lifting of access restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian nationals. Migrants from all EU states will have to wait for three months before applying for jobseeker's allowance (JSA) and other out-of-work benefits.

The number of children in the UK who have non-British parents has soared, with almost nine in ten babies born in 2012 born to at least one foreign parent. Just three in 10 London babies born in 2012 had both parents born in the UK, and in three London boroughs, as few as one fifth of babies had British-born parents. Across England and Wales, one in three babies had non-UK born parents, according to the Office for National Statistics. Births: One in three babies born in the UK has at least one foreign parents, ONS figures show . The number of non-British people who come to the UK to have children has increased, as the proportion of babies with foreign-born mothers or fathers went from 21.2 per cent in 2000 to 31.4 per cent in 2012. The number of foreign-born people in Britain has quadrupled over the past 60 years, with immigration being at the heart of almost half of all population growth. David Cameron has announced that restrictions on EU migrants claiming benefits in the new year, which he said would make the UK a 'less attractive place for EU migrants'. EU citizens who come to the UK will have to wait three months . before they can claim out-of-work benefits, while those who fail an English test will also be denied some benefits. But the restrictions are coming into place at the same time as restrictions are dropped on Romanians and Bulgarians taking certain jobs when they come to Britain. Cap: David Cameron's proposals include a cap of 75,000 EU migrants and limiting access to benefits . Previously, temporary restrictions - which had been extended to their maximum period of seven years after Bulgarians and Romanians gained the right to visa-free travel in the UK in 2007 - meant low-skilled workers were restricted by quotas, employers had to apply for work permits and migrants for an 'accession worker card'. Once these restrictions expire, Bulgarians and Romanians should be entitled to claim the same benefits and NHS care as other EU citizens. The Home Office has proposed a 75,000 cap on EU migrants - although Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has slammed this as 'pointless', 'arbitrary' and 'distracting'. Meanwhile, Labour's immigration policy has been blamed for allowing foreign workers an 'open door'. Conservative MP Nigel Mills said: 'The rate . of change over the past decade has been staggering.

But kind-hearted locals in Boulogne have now turned Adelaide Kabou's grave into a flower-filled shrine after hearing of her plight. The case of Adelaïde, who was 15 months old, sent shock waves around France when details emerged of how her mother Fabienne Kabou, 36, travelled to Berck sur Mer in November to dispose of her because she was 'incompatible' with her relationship with her artist boyfriend.

David Cameron has been challenged by Labour to 'come clean' about his links to the lobbyist . David Cameron last night faced being dragged into a damaging ‘lunches for lobbyists’ scandal over a £400 million property scheme. The Prime Minister was challenged by Labour to ‘come clean’ about his links to Simon Hoare, the lobbyist at the centre of the row over plans for a massive rail freight terminal. No 10 has already been accused of a ‘whitewash’ after Cabinet Minister Theresa Villiers was last week cleared of wrongdoing over a private lunch with Mr Hoare – at which the development on a former airfield in Hertfordshire was allegedly discussed. But Labour last night switched the attack on to Mr Cameron’s own links with the lobbyist, a Tory member of the West Oxfordshire council that covers the Prime Minister’s Witney constituency, and has been pictured with him on election leaflets. Labour claimed Mr Hoare was a ‘close friend’ of Mr Cameron and demanded to know if the two men had ever discussed the rail depot project first proposed in 2006, which is still awaiting approval from Ministers. Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Jon Ashworth said the Prime Minister must answer a series of questions over his relationship with Mr Hoare, chief lobbyist for rail depot developers Helioslough. That included whether he had been invited to No 10 by Mr Cameron and how many times the Prime Minister had met him without officials present since 2010. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood last week rejected a complaint from St Albans Tory MP Anne Main over Ms Villiers lunching with Mr Hoare in 2011 when she was a Transport Minister. After the lunch, Mr Hoare reportedly emailed asking her to ‘press the case for a speedy and supportive decision’. Sir Jeremy insisted Ms Villiers, now the Northern Ireland Secretary, took no action as a result of the lunch which she described as a ‘personal engagement with a long-standing friend’. Simon Hoare (left) is at the centre of a row over the £400m rail depot project. Last week Cabinet Minister Theresa Villiers (right) was cleared of wrongdoing over a private lunch with the lobbyist . But Mr Ashworth said Mr Cameron should not have referred the complaint to the Cabinet Secretary – given his personal links with Mr Hoare. The Labour frontbencher said: ‘He should have passed it outside the remit of No 10 to the independent adviser on Ministers’ interests.’ Last night, Mrs Main – who has branded Sir Jeremy’s inquiry a ‘whitewash’ – declined to comment on the Prime Minister’s links with Mr Hoare. But the local MP, a fierce opponent of the plan to build five warehouses with railway sidings on the Hertfordshire greenbelt, revealed she had resubmitted her complaint about Ms Villiers. In a letter to the Cabinet Secretary, she accused him of seemingly not even considering the ministerial code requiring Ministers to ‘ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests’. Mrs Main added: ‘Many of my constituents believe Ms Villiers’s actions directly point to a conflict of interest, so there is at least the perception of a conflict.’ But No 10 last night denied any wrongdoing.","Prime Minister told to 'come clean' about links to Simon Hoare .

A robber who mugged a disabled pensioner man for £10 and a 78-year-old woman for £6 wept as he was jailed for five years. Colton Bridgeman, 20, ran up behind the elderly man as he walked with a zimmer frame in Ipswich, Suffolk. Bridgeman, a drug addict, rifled through the shell-shocked 89-year-old's pockets, taking out his belongings and throwing them on the floor. The callous man pushed his victim against a wall before running off with just £10 on August 10. Two days later a 78-year-old woman was cruelly targeted. Again Bridgeman ran up behind her and snatched her purse containing just £6 cash from her handbag. Both victims were targeted after they had been shopping in a town centre Sainsbury's. Bridgeman, of Harwich, Essex, admitted two offences of robbery. He also asked for seven offences, including theft and burglary, to be considered. He wept as he was given five years detention at a young offenders' institution. Ipswich Crown Court heard how the robber had caused great distress to his elderly victims. Speaking about the disabled pensioner, Marcus Croskell, prosecuting, said: 'He was so flabbergasted he sat down. He was very upset.'

Guilty: Iain Merrick, 39, is facing jail after sending a homemade bomb to a post office in Manchester . A man is facing jail after sending a homemade bomb to a post office because he had developed a 'long-standing grudge' against the Royal Mail. Iain Merrick, 39, claimed he was wrongly receiving up to 30 letters a day that were supposed to be delivered to his neighbours. After making numerous complaints, he built an improvised device from nails, razor blades, light bulb fragments and fish hooks. He then posted it in a letter box near his home in Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester. A postman later opened the postbox to find the cigarette packet-sized device, which had a 12-volt battery and two wires protruding from it - each one attached to a nail. The discovery triggered a mass evacuation of the immediate area and a 100-metre cordon being placed around the scene, while bomb disposal experts were called to make the device safe. If the two nails had touched, an electrical circuit would have been completed - prompting an intense fire which could have injured the postman. Today, Merrick was found guilty of sending an explosive substance, as well as making and . distributing indecent images. When police searched Merrick's home, officers found a pen drive in a boiler cupboard which contained terrorism-related documents entitled Bombs: Explosives, Experiments, The Anarchist Cookbook and Mujahideen Explosives Handbook. They also discovered he had also sent letters to six primary schools containing pornographic images of children - using the names and occupations of postal workers in a bid to smear them. Crime: Merrick planted the explosive device outside Winter Hey post office (pictured) in Horwich, near Bolton . Discovery: A shocked postman later opened the postbox to find the cigarette packet-sized, 12-volt device . He had also put white stickers around the area falsely claiming one postal worker was a convicted paedophile. Manchester Crown Court was told Merrick had developed a 'long-standing grudge' toward employees of the Royal Mail in 2008 after he began to experience problems with his post at his flat where he lived alone. Merrick claimed his upstairs neighbour would mistakenly receive his post - causing him to ask for his own mail to be redirected to another address for six months. Eventually it was agreed that staff would hold his mail at the post office and he would go to collect it personally. Response: The shocking discovery triggered a mass evacuation by police (pictured) in Horwich, near Bolton . Grudge: Merrick developed a 'long-standing grudge' against the Royal Mail after 'wrongly receiving up to 30 letters a day that were supposed to be delivered to his neighbours', Manchester Crown Court heard . But in July 2010, he complained of receiving letters addressed to his neighbour and made several complaints to the post office. During the trial, Merrick said: 'It could range from three to four letters a week to 30 a day, more than that. I did go down to the depot, but they said they are not allowed to hold onto any mail. However, the court was told Merrick became 'obsessive' about his mail and would constantly carry a voice recorder in his pocket so he could record every conversation he had with postal workers during complaints. Later, he researched the postmen on Google and the electoral role in an attempt to find out where they lived. Making the area safe: Police stand guard in a street close to where Merrick's bomb was discovered . In November 2010, police spoke to Merrick about him harassing Royal Mail workers - causing him to reply: 'I'm not going to send a bomb in the mail or anything'. The following April, the homemade bomb was found by postman Ian Platt as he emptied the postbox outside Winter Hey post office. Vanessa Thomson, prosecuting, said: 'He had a long-standing grudge towards employees of the Royal Mail. This grudge caused him to harass postal workers in a variety of ways but that conduct turned quite sinister.' Police raided Merrick's home in September 2012 and discovered a pen drive containing a folder entitled 'Dangerous'. It comprised hundreds of pages including an article containing a diagram and instructions on how to make a pipe bomb from a 2010 issue of the terrorist publication 'Inspire'. Another folder provided details of how to handle chemicals, the methods used to make explosives and how to avoid detection. Officers also found handwriting and scribbles with legible words and phrases related to . creating explosive devices, such as 'gunpowder,' 'flash paper' and 'big . boom.' They later discovered 533 indecent images of children and internet searches for mocked-up 'psuedo' nude images of Harry Potter actress Emma Watson. Forensic analysis of Merrick's DNA found 13 matches on the bomb. He had also posted videos on how to make a pipe bomb and the mechanics of an electronic fly zapper on YouTube. However, when questioned, Merrick denied any wrongdoing and claimed he had been 'experimenting' with chemicals at home. He added that he had even 'blown himself up' twice during his bizarre experiments. Speaking outside court, Detective Sargent Russ Stubbs, of the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, said: 'Merrick waged a one-man crusade against the post office, a one-sided conflict that seems to have been ignited by the tiniest of sparks. 'A perceived problem with mail going to the wrong house was all it took for Merrick to launch an escalating vendetta which involved sexual slurs and sending a letter bomb to a post office. 'Had this crude device gone off, then the unfortunate postal worker who opened it could have suffered very serious injuries. 'You do not need a vivid imagination to foresee the kind of damage that razor blades and fish hooks could have caused to a human being. 'One of his most damaging actions was to post indecent images of children and babies to local primary schools, with details of two postal workers on the back. 'Had this information got out into the wider public, as was presumably his intention, then these completely innocent people would not only have had their careers and reputations destroyed, but they could have been subjected to vigilante attacks. 'Thankfully Merrick was never allowed to succeed in his plans which could have left careers destroyed and innocent postal workers with severe mental distress and physical injury.' Merrick has been remanded in custody until sentencing in February.","Iain Merrick sent homemade bomb to post office in Horwich, Manchester .

Protesters trashed a Domino's Pizza outlet in a Mumbai suburb on Friday in protest over the arrest and subsequent strip-search of an Indian diplomat in New York.Activists from the small Republican Party of India are demanding a ban on all American goods until charges are dropped against Devyani Khobragade, 39, who was arrested on allegations of visa fraud and under-payment of her housekeeper last week.The case has caused an international spat, with the Indian government retaliating by revoking the privileges of American diplomats in India and removing security barriers from outside the U.S. embassy in New Delhi. Protest: Shattered glass is visible in this picture of the Mumbai Domino's outlet that was attacked by protesters demanding the U.S. drop charges against Devyani Khobragade . Diplomatic row: Devyani Khobragade was arrested in New York and released on a $250,000 bond after pleading not guilty in court . Members of the Republican Party of India sent pictures of a broken glass door to media organizations following the ransacking of the pizza chain, saying it wanted all charges against India's deputy consul general in New York dropped. Khobragade was arrested last Thursday outside her daughter's Manhattan school last Thursday and released on $250,000 bail after giving up her passport and pleading not guilty to charges of visa fraud and making false statements about how much she paid her housekeeper. She faces a maximum of 15 years in prison if convicted on both counts. Prosecutors say Khobragade claimed on her visa application that she paid her Indian maid $4,500 a month but that she actually paid her $3 an hour. In an email published in the Indian media on Wednesday, Khobragade said she was treated like a common criminal. Ill feeling: Anti-American sentiment is rife in India after the arrest of Khobragade, which has been perceived as an affront to the whole country . 'I broke down many times as the indignities of repeated handcuffing, stripping and cavity searches, swabbing, in a holdup with common criminals and drug addicts were all being imposed upon me despite my incessant assertions of immunity,' she wrote.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed regret over the case in a phone call to India's national security adviser this week, but U.S. prosecutors have defended the investigation against Khobragade and her treatment.Police in Mumbai said they were stepping up patrolling of major U.S. outlets including McDonald's after workers of the small Republican Party of India attacked the Dominos store. The group sent pictures to media organizations showing a broken glass door.'The fact is that [the] American authorities have behaved atrociously with an Indian diplomat. And obviously, America has to make good for its actions,' said Manish Tiwari, minister for information and broadcasting. Reinforcements: Indian police are stepping up security at American fast food chains such as McDonald's after the attack . 'So therefore, I think it is a legitimate expectation, that if they have erred, and they have erred grievously in this matter, they should come forth and apologize.' The U.S. Justice Department confirmed that Khobragade was strip-searched after her arrest. A senior Indian government source has said the interrogation also included a cavity search, although U.S. officials have denied this. 'I want these false and fabricated charges to be dropped,' said Uttam Khobragade, the diplomat's father, adding that he would go on a hunger strike if his demands aren't met. 'That will be my last option.' Protesters also gathered at the U.S. consulate in Hyderabad for a second day on Friday, shouting slogans, local media said. Furious that one of its foreign service officers had been handcuffed and treated like 'a common criminal,' India on Tuesday removed security barriers outside the U.S. embassy in New Delhi and withdrew some privileges from U.S. diplomats. Mass indignation: Members of the National Students Union of India protest outside the U.S. consulate in Mumbai on Friday . But the reaction was even more intense because none of the political parties preparing for next year's election wanted to be seen as weak against a superpower. Politicians, including the leaders of the two main parties, refused to meet a delegation of visiting U.S. lawmakers. 'Because of the election, they will try to outdo each other,' said Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst and a former political editor of Indian Express newspaper. 'They don't want to be seen as weak on the issue when the mood in the country is one of huge anger about this.' The party that runs India's most populous Uttar Pradesh state urged Khobragade to stand for parliament, highlighting how public outrage has turned the case into a battleground for votes. Desperate measures: Uttam Khobragade, father of Devyani Khobragade, has said he will go on a hunger strike if she is not exhonerated . 'Whatever happened with her is condemnable,' said Azam Khan, the state's urban development minister, according to media reports. 'If she returns to India, we are ready to give her a ticket for the 2014 polls.' Breathless and indignant coverage by Indian TV news channels has added to a sense that national pride has been wounded. There has been little focus, however, on the predicament of the housekeeper, whose lawyer says was denied her wages, underpaid, and now feels it would be unsafe to return to India. 'One wonders why there is so much outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian national accused of perpetrating these acts, but precious little outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian victim and her spouse,' Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement on Wednesday.","Members of the small Republican Party of India ransacked a suburban Mumbai Domino's .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:27 EST, 20 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:27 EST, 20 December 2013 . More than 1,000 Muslim couples tied the knot at a mass wedding Thursday in Nigeria's second city of Kano, part of a government programme aimed at promoting stable families. The elaborate event at the city's central mosque included 1,111 previously divorced women and an equal number of men, many of whom had also been married before. The mass wedding programme was launched last year by the state government and sharia police, or Hisbah, who enforce Islamic law, in response to what officials have described as a divorce epidemic. Bride and joy: Nigerian Muslim women pictured before they tie the knot in Kano, Nigeria . 'We are gathered here today to solemnise the weddings of 1,111 couples under Kano state’s mass wedding programme,' Deputy Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje said at the ceremony, the fourth of its kind since May 2012. 'The high divorce rate in our state leads to rampant cases of births outside wedlock, with children being born and dumped which leads to appalling social decay,' Ganduje said. Hisbah chief Aminu Daurawa said the programme has arranged 4,461 marriages over the last 18 months. The deputy governor called for stricter policies to discourage divorce and, when marriages do break up, harsher penalties for men who fail to pay alimony so that single mothers can 'provide a good upbringing for their children and make them good citizens'. Religious authorities married 1,111 couples in a bid to combat rising rates of divorce and births out of wedlock . Under the match-making programme, the state government pays the traditional bride price, provides brides with furniture and seed money to start a small business. Kano's government and the Hisbah have launched a massive crackdown on so-called 'immorality', arresting hundreds of people accused of using drugs, engaging in commercial sex and dressing inappropriately. The Hisbah also destroyed 240,000 bottles of beer at a public ceremony last month. Officially, sharia was restored across Nigeria's mainly Muslim north in 2001, but the Islamic legal code has been unevenly applied. Daurawa told AFP the crackdown on immorality and the marriage programme are also being applied to Kano's minority Christian population. 'We have included 50 Christian couples in this batch in liaison with the Christian leaders in the state and they will have their weddings in church,' he said.","The event in Kano saw 1,111 previously divorced women remarry .
The spectacle was part of a programme aimed at promoting stable families ."
