"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Police clashed with hundreds of rioters in eastern Belfast on Tuesday in the second straight night of sectarian violence there. About 700 people had amassed in the streets Tuesday night, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said. Molotov cocktails, fireworks and bricks were being thrown, police said. Police fired water cannons on the crowd and asked the media to move away from the area. Two men suffered burns and one man was injured after shots were fired, police reported. Reporters retreated from the area after a newspaper photographer was shot in the leg. Sectarian rioting began late Monday in eastern Belfast, with leaders from both Catholic and Protestant communities reporting attacks on homes overnight. Police reported Molotov cocktails were being thrown as a large crowd gathered on the streets that separate Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods in the area, a longstanding Northern Ireland flash point. Ambulance services reported two people injured early Tuesday, and reporters attempting to cover the disturbances were threatened. The Irish republican party Sinn Fein said up to 100 masked men raided Catholic-owned homes in the Short Strand neighborhood after allegations by unionist politicians that Protestant homes were attacked Sunday. Police had no information on any of Sunday's reported attacks. Sinn Fein blamed the attacks on Catholics on members of the Ulster Volunteer Force, a loyalist paramilitary group that officially disarmed in 2009. Police had no immediate comment on the assertion. After a long period of quiet in its ongoing ""Troubles"" between Catholics and Protestants, Northern Ireland has seen a resurgence of violence in recent months. Tensions also are typically elevated in early summer, when Protestant groups hold commemorative marches to celebrate the 17th century victory of England's King William III over his Catholic predecessor, James II. ""We would appeal to anyone with any influence to continue to work with police to tackle these issues which are damaging for the whole community,"" Assistant Chief Constable Alistair Finlay said Tuesday in a statement. ""This is an issue that cannot be addressed by police alone.""","Rioters pelt police with petrol bombs, fireworks and bricks, police say .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from the devastating tornado that ripped through Joplin, Missouri, last month has risen to 155, a city spokeswoman said Monday. The previous death toll, reported on Friday, was 154. The most recent death was Edmon A. Cooper, Joplin city spokeswoman Lynn Onstot said. Cooper died from injuries sustained during the May 22 tornado, Onstot said. No other details were immediately available. The Joplin tornado was the deadliest single U.S. twister in more than 60 years, according to National Weather Service records. It left a 13-mile-long trail of destruction through the southwest Missouri city, stripping the bark from trees and smashing homes into unrecognizable rubble.","The previous death toll, reported on Friday, was 154 .

"(CNN) -- A self-help guru who was convicted in the deaths of three participants in an Arizona sweat lodge ceremony deserves a new trial, his attorneys argued Tuesday. James Arthur Ray was found guilty of negligent homicide in the deaths of the participants, but an Arizona jury in June deemed him not guilty of manslaughter charges. Negligent homicide means a defendant should have known better, while manslaughter suggests that the defendant knew and blatantly disregarded this knowledge. Ray's attorneys went before a Superior Court judge in Yavapai County, Arizona, claiming he should be tried again because of prosecutorial misconduct, a court official said. The official, who was not authorized to speak to the media, said the hearing started shortly after 11 a.m. MT and ran until a lunch break. The hearing is scheduled to run for the rest of the day. The defense claims the prosecution did not disclose evidence on time. Ray's sentencing, originally scheduled for July 25, has been pushed back. The case stems from an October 2009 ceremony in Sedona, Arizona. Prosecutors claimed that Ray's recklessness in operating the sweat lodge caused the deaths of Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York; James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee; and Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota. At least 15 others who took part in the sweat lodge ceremony became ill. More than 40 others were uninjured. Prosecutors argued that the lodge, made of willow trees and branches and covered with tarpaulins and blankets, was heated to a perilously high temperature, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke. They also said Ray didn't monitor the temperature inside the lodge or the well-being of participants and was indifferent to those clearly having trouble. Ray's lawyers countered that what happened was a tragic accident, not a crime. They asked witnesses who were in the sweat lodge whether they signed a release form warning them of the dangers. All replied that they signed, but some said they didn't read the form. Ray's attorneys also suggested that exposure to an unknown toxin in the lodge -- perhaps a pesticide, rat poison or something in the type of wood used to heat the rocks -- could have caused the deaths. Event participants paid up to $10,000 to seek ""new areas of consciousness"" at the October 2009 Spiritual Warrior retreat in the desert, according to trial testimony. Many had attended previous James Ray International seminars.","Defendant's lawyers want a new trial .

"(CNN) -- A 43-year-old Missouri man -- who told police he suffocated his 3-year-old neighbor with a plastic bag, then stuffed her body in the same bag and tossed her from a highway -- appeared in court Tuesday, but did not enter a plea. Shawn Morgan of Senath has been charged with first-degree murder. His next court appearance is scheduled for August 30. The girl, Breeann Rodriguez, was last seen on August 6, riding her pink bicycle with her brother outside their home in Senath. While authorities have found her bike, authorities continue to search for her body, Dunklin County Prosecuting Attorney Stephen Sokoloff said. Sokoloff added -- and the Dunklin County court clerk's office confirmed -- that Morgan does not yet have an attorney. The August 30 court appearance will be a counsel status hearing, the prosecutor's office said Tuesday. According to a probable cause affidavit dated Saturday, police interviewed Morgan on Friday at the police department in Kennett, a larger community about 10 miles northeast of Senath. The suspect said that he spotted the girl standing on a ladder by the pool in his backyard, in Breeann's neighborhood. He told police that he grabbed the girl and carried her inside his house. There, according to the affidavit, the man ""suffocated the girl with a white plastic trash bag, by holding it over her face and mouth. ""Morgan states that he felt like it took an hour for the girl to die,"" the document adds. It says Morgan told police he put the girl's body into the same trash bag, and then drove to Missouri's Highway 164 and got rid of the body by throwing it over a railing into a floodway ditch. After returning home, Morgan said, he then dismantled the girl's bike and dumped it into another, related waterway, the document says. A bicycle was recovered there and identified by Edgar Rodriguez as belonging to Breeann, his daughter. Police said Thursday that they had found two training wheels similar to those on the girl's bike. In addition to murder, Sokoloff said in a statement Saturday that Morgan is charged with armed criminal action and tampering with physical evidence. The suspect, who Sokoloff said has three children of his own, is being held at the Dunklin County Justice Center. Meanwhile, the approximately 1,800 residents of Senath -- a town in southeast Missouri's ""bootheel"" area, about 90 miles north of Memphis, Tennessee -- are trying to come to grips with what happened. Sharon Haddock, who raised two children on the same street as both the victim and her alleged killer, said Monday that she knew Morgan as ""a little boy"" and knew some of his family members as ""very nice people."" ""It's just beyond belief that anybody ... could have done this, but now anybody on your street,"" she told HLN's Vinnie Politan. ""You think you know your neighbors, but you don't know them as well as you think you do. I would have never dreamed this in a million years."" Another neighbor, Estelle Floyd, said she had lived 89 of her 90 years always feeling safe. But that sense of security has been shaken, and she's still trying to make sense of what happened. ""All these neighbors ... they'd do anything for anybody at any time,"" Floyd told HLN. ""This was such a shock. ... It has touched the hearts of everybody in this town.""

"Oranjestad, Aruba (CNN) -- An FBI official has arrived in Aruba to assist with the investigation into the disappearance of a Maryland woman during a vacation there, an island official said Tuesday. In addition, investigators plan to mount another search for 35-year-old Robyn Gardner in the coming days, Solicitor General Taco Stein told CNN. The efforts will be focused on the southern tip of the Dutch Caribbean island, Stein said, with police, firefighters and Dutch troops taking part. FBI agents have already been involved in the case, searching the Gaithersburg, Maryland, home of the man now being held in connection with Gardner's disappearance. A judge in Aruba ordered Monday that the suspect, Gary Giordano, be held for another 16 days while police continue their investigation. According to Aruban prosecutors, the missing woman and the suspect arrived on the island July 31 from the United States. She was last seen August 2 near Baby Beach, on the west side of the island. Giordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office. He said Gardner was nowhere to be found when he reached the beach, according to prosecutors. Giordano's lawyer, Michael Lopez, argued unsuccessfully Monday that there was not enough evidence to keep his client behind bars.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Dozens of Atlanta public school educators falsified standardized tests or failed to address such misconduct in their schools, Gov. Nathan Deal said Tuesday in unveiling the results of a state investigation that confirmed widespread cheating in the city schools dating as far back as 2001. Some of the cheating could result in criminal charges, Deal said. ""I think the overall conclusion was that testing and results and targets being reached became more important than actual learning for children,"" Deal said. ""And when reaching targets became the goal, it was a goal that was pursued with no excuses."" Falsifying test results made the schools appear to be performing better than they really were. But in the process, students were deprived of critical remedial education and taxpayers were cheated, as well, Deal said. Investigators said 178 teachers and principals working at 44 schools were involved. The educators, including 38 principals, were either directly involved in erasing wrong answers on a key standardized test or they knew -- or should have known -- what was going on, according to Deal's office. Deal's office said 82 of the educators acknowledged involvement, according to the report. Six principals declined to answer investigators' questions and invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Deal said. Whether to bring criminal charges will be up to prosecutors, Deal said. Georgia State School Superintendent Dr. John Barge and Kathleen Mathers, executive director of the governor's Office of Student Achievement, released a joint statement Tuesday condemning ""unethical behavior."" ""Some educators, including those in leadership positions, chose their own interests over helping students entrusted to their care,"" the statement said. ""While this story has dominated the headlines over the last couple of years, it is important to remember that the vast majority of the educators in Georgia are ethically sound and work diligently with the best interests of their students in mind."" The investigation's findings have been forwarded to the state teacher licensing board, Deal said. That agency could take disciplinary action against the educators involved. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who was briefed on the report, said the investigation ""confirms our worst fears."" ""There is no doubt that systemic cheating occurred on a widespread basis in the school system,"" Reed said in a statement. ""Further, there is no question that a complete failure of leadership in the Atlanta Public School system hurt thousands of children who were promoted to the next grade without meeting basic academic standards."" The cheating was brought to light after marked improvements in the district's performance on the 2009 statewide Criterion-Referenced Competency test (CRCT) revealed a pattern of incorrect test answers being erased and replaced with correct answers. Investigators compared the results with test results from other Georgia schools and found that such patterns did not occur normally, Deal said. That the district's CRCT results fell in 2010 further confirmed the findings, according to the report. A spokesman for Atlanta Public Schools said district officials would have no immediate comment. The cheating accompanied a ""culture of fear, intimidation and retaliation"" within the district, according to a summary of the report released by Deal's office. The report also found a ""major failure of leadership"" within the district. Beverly Hall, who was superintendent of the district when the cheating scandal surfaced, has since resigned. Hall won accolades for the district's apparent successes during her tenure, and she was named superintendent of the year by the American Association of School Administrators in 2009. Neither Hall nor her attorney, Richard Deane, has seen or been briefed on the report, Deane said Tuesday. The full text of the report was not released. Deal said it was being withheld pending consultation with the state attorney general's office.","New: Educators chose own interests over helping students, superintendent says .

"(CNN)  -- The world's poorest countries could pay 40 percent more for food this year than they did last year because of rising prices, according to a United Nations report released Thursday. Rising food prices have left many people, like this Ugandan boy, unable to afford food and malnourished. In those countries, nearly a billion people are on the brink of malnourishment and, as food prices climb, more at risk of starving. The latest Food Outlook report, compiled by the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization, shows that countries which spend a substantial part of their budgets on food will pay $169 billion this year for food imports. That is 40 percent higher than last year and four times higher than in 2000. ""Food is no longer the cheap commodity that it once was,"" FAO Assistant Director-General Hafez Ghanem said. ""Rising food prices are bound to worsen the already unacceptable level of food deprivation suffered by 854 million people. ""We are facing the risk that the number of hungry will increase by many more millions of people."" The FAO lists 82 countries as ""Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries"" that cannot produce or import enough food to meet their all their population's needs. More than half of the countries are in Africa. Riots from Haiti to Bangladesh to Egypt this year over surging food prices brought the issue to a boiling point. The United Nations' World Food Program and World Bank President Robert Zoellick recently appealed to the international community to donate $500 milllion to help meet emergency needs by those hit by the high food and fuel prices. Last month, U.S. President Bush ordered the release of $200 million in emergency aid. The money, to be drawn from a food reserve, will address food needs in Africa and elsewhere, the White House said. The United States is the world's largest provider of food aid, delivering more than $2.1 billion in food aid to 78 countries last year, the White House said in a statement. ""This is the world's big story,"" said Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University's Earth Institute. ""There are riots all over the world in the poor countries. ... Our own poor are feeling it in the United States."" Zoellick has said the rising costs could mean ""seven lost years"" in the fight against worldwide poverty. ""While many are worrying about filling their gas tanks, many others around the world are struggling to fill their stomachs, and it is getting more and more difficult every day,"" Zoellick said last month in a speech opening meetings with the world's finance ministers. ""In just two months,"" Zoellick said, ""rice prices have skyrocketed to near historical levels, rising by around 75 percent globally and more in some markets, with more likely to come. In Bangladesh, a 2-kilogram bag of rice ... now consumes about half of the daily income of a poor family."" The price of wheat has jumped 120 percent in the past year, he said, meaning that the price of a loaf of bread has more than doubled in places where the poor spend as much as 75 percent of their income on food. ""This is not just about meals forgone today or about increasing social unrest. This is about lost learning potential for children and adults in the future, stunted intellectual and physical growth,"" Zoellick said. In the United States and other Western nations, more and more poor families are feeling the pinch. In recent days, presidential candidates have paid increasing attention to the cost of food, often citing it on the stump. The issue is also fueling a rising debate over how much the rising prices can be blamed on ethanol production. The basic argument is that because ethanol comes from corn, the push to replace some traditional fuels with ethanol has created a new demand for corn that has thrown off world food prices. Jean Ziegler, U.N. special rapporteur on the right to food, has called using food crops to create ethanol ""a crime against humanity."" Sachs said, ""We've been putting our food into the gas tank; this corn-to-ethanol subsidy which our government is doing really makes little sense."" The ethanol industry rejects the focus on ethanol in examining food prices. ""The contrived food vs. fuel debate has reared its ugly head once again,"" the Renewable Fuels Association, which lobbies Congress on the behalf of the industry, said on its Web site, adding that ""numerous statistical analyses have demonstrated that the price of oil -- not corn prices or ethanol production -- has the greatest impact on consumer food prices because it is integral to virtually every phase of food production, from processing to packaging to transportation."" Analysts agree that the cost of fuel is among the reasons for the skyrocketing prices. Another major reason is rising demand, particularly in places in the midst of a population boom, such as China and India. Also, Sachs said, ""climate shocks"" are damaging food supply in parts of the world. ""You add it all together: Demand is soaring; supply has been cut back; food has been diverted into the gas tank. It's added up to a price explosion.""","Report: Poor countries will spend $169 billion this year on food imports .

"(CNN) -- The Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) has written to motorsport's governing body about the 2011 race calendar amidst a backdrop of confusion over the re-instated Bahrain Grand Prix. FOTA confirmed to CNN they had sent a letter to the International Automobile Federation (FIA) and the Bahrain International Circuit discussing the season's schedule, after the recent decision to stage the Bahrain race in October. The original event was canceled in March due to ongoing civil unrest in the Gulf kingdom but Max Mosley, former head of the FIA, told CNN Tuesday that he would be ""astonished"" if the grand prix went ahead. Mosley said any change to the race calendar would have to be unanimously supported by all 12 F1 teams -- something he thought was highly unlikely. Mosley: Bahrain Grand Prix will not go ahead . Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone also admitted to CNN in Monaco that he was unsure whether the race would go ahead. When asked if F1 could take a stand against the violence in the country he said: ""I think it would be difficult to do that, but I think we'd have to -- sort of -- do something that would keep everybody peaceful."" Red Bull driver Mark Webber criticized the FIA's decision saying on his personal web site: ""I'll be highly surprised if the Bahrain Grand Prix goes ahead this year."" In a statement, FOTA confirmed to CNN: ""The Teams have discussed the 2011 calendar within FOTA and have expressed their views privately in a letter to the FIA, FOM (Formula One Management) and the Bahrain International Circuit."" Canada is the next stop on the schedule for Formula One, as they prepare for this weekend's Montreal Grand Prix, where questions over the Bahrain race will remain high on the agenda. The UK Press Association reported Tuesday that the FOTA letter demanded the FIA abandon plans to return to Bahrain due to ""logistical and safety concerns."" They also claimed the plan to switch the Indian Grand Prix to the end of the season, in December, in order to accommodate the Bahrain race was ""unbearable to our staff."" On Tuesday, Mosley told CNN there was little chance of the Bahrain GP going ahead and claimed there would be no serious damage done to the sport's reputation if the FIA were to swiftly cancel plans to return. He said: ""When you're going to change something in the middle of the season, like the proposal to move the Indian race for example, that needs the unanimous agreement of all the teams. I don't think there's the slightest chance of that actually being given. ""The teams have complete power in this particular case because although the governing body can cancel an event for reason of force majeure - as happened in the case of Bahrain -- when you want to put an event on or move an event, that's a change to the conditions under which the teams entered for the season and that's like any contract -- you can only change it if both sides agree. ""All 12 teams would have to agree to change the Indian date and go back to Bahrain, so it only takes one team to say 'I don't agree' and that'll be the end of it. It would not be possible for it to happen.""","Formula One Teams Association write to sport's governing body about 2011 calendar .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two suspected U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal region killed 21 alleged militants Tuesday, intelligence officials said. Two Pakistani intelligence officials said one suspected drone fired four missiles, killing 13 people at an alleged militant hideout in the area of Shawal in South Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan. The second strike occurred hours later on another suspected militant hideout in North Waziristan. Eight people were killed, the officials said. The officials asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media. On Monday, a similar attack killed 10 suspected militants in North Waziristan. The overwhelming majority of drone strikes have targeted areas in North and South Waziristan. Analysts say the areas are havens for militants fueling the insurgencies in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The United States does not comment on suspected drone strikes. But it is the only country in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones -- which are controlled remotely.

"(CNN) -- For the third time this weekend, U.S. jet fighters on Sunday intercepted a small private plane that violated restricted airspace in the area of Camp David, Maryland, while President Barack Obama stayed there, the North American Aerospace Defense Command said. Two F-15E fighters under NORAD control intercepted a Cessna 182 civilian aircraft on Sunday morning and led it out of the temporary restricted area, according to a NORAD statement. The Cessna landed at the Carroll County Regional Airport, the NORAD statement said. On Saturday, two similar incidents occurred involving other aircraft that violated the restricted area around the presidential retreat, a NORAD spokesman confirmed. There was no extra security threat involved in any of the incidents beyond the violation of the temporary restricted area. Authorities attribute the multiple violations to the temporary expansion of restricted airspace around Camp David when Obama is there. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the temporary flight restriction in the Camp David area this weekend was scheduled to last from noon Saturday until 6 p.m. Sunday.","NORAD scrambles jet fighters twice on Saturday, once on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- British supermodel Naomi Campbell called an ad campaign comparing her to a chocolate candy bar ""insulting and hurtful,"" hinting that she might sue the company that ran the ad in magazines and on billboards. The ad featured a photo of the Cadbury Dairy Milk Bliss sitting on a pile of diamonds below the slogan ""Move over Naomi, there's a new diva in town."" A spokesman for Cadbury told CNN Tuesday the chocolate maker never intended ""to cause any offense and the campaign itself is a light-hearted take on the social pretensions of Cadbury Dairy Milk Bliss."" Campbell, in a written statement sent to CNN Tuesday, said she was shocked.

"(CNN) -- A day after her sister Serena's comeback was ended in Eastbourne, Venus Williams suffered a similar fate losing in the quarterfinals to Daniela Hantuchova. The Slovak battled hard in blustery conditions on the south coast of England as she recorded a 6-2 5-7 6-2 win -- her first over Venus in 11 meetings. Williams had been out of action for five months with an abdominal injury before returning for the warm-up tournament ahead of Wimbledon and showed flashes of her old self in the second set. Hantuchova told the WTA's official web site: ""I was not thinking about our other matches at all. I was just focusing on my game today. ""I had a good win yesterday and I wanted to build on that. But I still feel there is a lot of room to improve. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I feel like I'm on the right way, which is pretty exciting for me."" Hantuchova breezed through the first set in just under 40 minutes after breaking Williams' serve twice to take it 6-2 and led the second 4-2 before Venus hit her stride. Williams then stormed back to take the second set before Hantuchova restored her dominance in the decider, breaking Williams twice and sealing the tie with her first match point. Venus said: ""The wind didn't make it very predictable, but I give her credit for hanging in there. On a day like today, you have to just hang in there. ""I think Daniela had a lot of motivation -- we've been playing I don't know how many years, and I am sure she has wanted to get a win against me for a long, long time."" ""It wasn't the best luck today, but I feel good about my preparation (for Wimbledon). More than anything I was able to get a lot of great competition. This has been ideal. I would have liked to win here, but there are positives here too."" Hantuchova said she was glad the Williams sisters were back in tennis. ""I think they're great for the game. I was really looking forward to the match today and really pleased I was able to make it through,"" she said. Hantuchova will now face fifth seed Petra Kvitova, from the Czech Republic after she battled back from dropping the opening set to beat Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska 1-6 6-2 7-6. The other semifinal will pit French No.6 seed Marion Bartoli against No.7 seed Samantha Stosur, from Australia. Bartoli was 6-2 2-0 up against Victoria Azarenka when the Belarusian retired, while Stosur triumphed 4-6 7-6 6-4 over number one seed Vera Zvonareva.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Seven Estonian cyclists kidnapped in northern Lebanon in March were released Thursday, the Lebanese Army said. All seven were in good health and will be taken to Beirut, the army said. They were found in the Bekaa Valley, the same area where they were abducted March 23. Lebanese Interior Minister Marwan Charbel told the LBC channel that 9 people implicated in the abduction of the Estonians have been arrested so far. They include Lebanese suspects and people of other nationalities, he said. Officials did not say whether a ransom was paid. ""The main thing now is for our seven fellow countrymen to get home to their families and loved ones as quickly as possible,"" Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet said. The men were abducted by ""local criminals"" in the Bekaa Valley as they bicycled into northeastern Lebanon from Syria, police told CNN earlier. They then were handed over to an unknown group. The following month, the men pleaded for help in gaining their release. In a video, which was sent as a YouTube link in an e-mail to the Estonian foreign ministry, one of the cyclists reads in English from a statement calling on Lebanese officials and the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and France to do anything in their power to get them back home. After that, each of the other men makes a short plea for help. The same month, a statement was posted on a Lebanese news portal by a previously unknown group calling itself the Renaissance and Reform Movement, saying it had carried out the kidnappings.

"(CNN) -- Cockiness and swagger serve him on the golf course, but there's much more to golf's young phenom, Rory McIlroy. The U.S. Open winner might hang with tennis great Rafael Nadal, knock back some Heinekens or slip the electronic dance sounds of Swedish House Mafia into his iPod. Such tidbits are rolling out these days from the 22-year-old hero of Holywood, Northern Ireland, who won the tournament by eight strokes and instantly drew comparisons to Tiger Woods. ""I didn't realize how much my life would change, even in the last 10 days,"" McIlroy said on ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" aired Thursday. As Woods has done over the years, McIlroy simply left the competition in the dust. He was the youngest winner of the tournament since the legendary Bobby Jones in 1923. For someone under a spotlight these days, the athlete with a tousle of hair looked at ease during his interview with Morgan. ""To me, I won a golf tournament and that was the end of it,"" McIlroy said. But it really is bigger than that."" He paid tribute to his parents, who both worked when he grew up. His father, Gerry, held down three jobs and was a ""calming influence"" during the U.S. Open, said McIlroy, an only child. The U.S. Open gave the golfer a shot of redemption after his final-round meltdown at the Masters in April. ""If anything it made me more determined to prove to people and myself that I wasn't ... a choker,"" McIlroy said. While saying he was inspired by Woods, McIlroy isn't one to compare himself. But he doesn't feel intimidated, either. ""I don't want to feel inferior to any other golfer in the world,"" he told Morgan. ""If you do that, you give them an advantage from the start."" While the young McIlroy has one major championship, Woods has 14, including three U.S. Open wins. Woods, 35, has had no PGA wins since taking a brief leave from the game in late 2009 after admitting infidelity. Life on the tour can bring its own problems, McIlroy conceded. ""You need a good team around you to keep you grounded."" McIlroy, who plays in the British Open next month, said he and girlfriend Holly Sweeney are a ""normal couple."" They have two dogs and she is completing her university degree. A fan of boxing and soccer, McIlroy said he doesn't want the flash of fame to affect him. After all, there are more tournaments to win. ""I'm very confident in my own abilities. I believe in myself,"" McIlroy said. ""I'm not playing for money. I'm playing for a place in history.""","Northern Ireland native won U.S. Open by eight strokes .

"(CNN) -- He grew up as the second son of late Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, deep in the shadow of his father. Bashar al-Assad was never meant to rule. He studied medicine in Britain, receiving a degree in ophthalmology, and headed the Syrian Computer Society. He switched his focus to military science, however, after the death in a 1994 car accident of his older brother, Bassel, who had been groomed to follow his father into the presidency. The death meant Bashar al-Assad was the next heir to power. When the elder al-Assad died in June 2000, it took only hours for the Syrian parliament to vote to amend the country's constitution to allow Bashar al-Assad to become president. The parliament lowered the age of eligibility of the president from 40 to 34, allowing the then-37-year-old son to take over. Read the latest news about the unrest in Syria . Within weeks, Bashar al-Assad was also made a member of the regional command for the ruling Baath Party, another requirement of succession. Now, the unrest in southern Syria, with amateur videos of violent protests and bloodied bodies, is starting to define al-Assad's rule in the eyes of the world. Human rights groups say such scenes are evidence of Syrian security forces firing on their own people, though state-run television disputes the claims. Syrians have lived in fear of political repression for decades. Hafez al-Assad ruled with an iron fist, ruthlessly putting down dissent by jailing dissidents and crushing the opposition. Since 1963, the country has been under emergency law, which effectively suspends most constitutional protections, according to the U.S. State Department. The law authorizes the government to conduct preventive and arbitrary arrests, according to the British Foreign Office. Security forces don't need to obtain arrest warrants and suspects may be detained for prolonged periods without charge or trial, or access to lawyers. Critics say Bashar al-Assad's security machine still holds a grip on the country -- and the president himself -- though he rejected that suggestion in a 2005 interview with CNN. ""They should choose,"" he said of his critics. ""You cannot be a dictator and not be in control."" Al-Assad, now 45, denies he is a dictator, seeing himself instead as a modern leader. His official website says he has built free-trade zones, licensed more private newspapers and private universities, and fought government waste and corruption. He has also worked on social and economic reform. While there have been some changes during his 10 years of rule, al-Assad's promises have largely not been delivered. Human Rights Watch calls it ""the wasted decade"" with a media that remains state-controlled, a monitored and censored internet, and prisons still filled with dissidents. Activists say that with the current protests, however, al-Assad can no longer look away. ""He has to start listening,"" said Wissam Tarif, executive director of the human rights group Insan. ""It's the time to start listening and acting. He can't afford any more promises."" Other analysts say force may have worked in the past to quell dissent, but not this time. ""The government is going to try to continue to use the tactics that it has for a very long time, which is just to snuff out any protest,"" said Anne-Marie Slaughter, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University. Now, however, ""the wall of fear is coming down."" CNN's Stan Grant contributed to this report.","Bashar al-Assad has ruled Syria since June 2000 .

"(CNN) -- More than two years after a chimpanzee mauled her, Charla Nash will once again be able to eat solid foods and regain her sense of smell thanks to a full face transplant, doctors at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital said Friday. ""I am happy to report that the team has achieved tremendous success,"" said Dr. Elof Eriksson, chief of the Division of Plastic Surgery. Surgeons also transplanted two hands to Nash, but they didn't thrive and were removed. In February 2009, Sandra Herold had called her friend Nash for help in getting her pet chimpanzee, Travis, back inside her house after he used a key to escape. When Nash arrived, the chimp, who had been featured in TV commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, jumped on her and began biting and mauling her, causing serious injuries to her face, neck and hands. Police shot Travis to halt the attack and he later died of gunshot wounds. Doctors say they see Nash as more than an animal attack victim. ""To us, Charla is a courageous, strong person. (She) inspired the team to do everything possible, using our collective expertise, to restore her quality of life,"" Plastic Surgeon Director Dr. Bohdan Pomahac said. Nash's face transplant was different than others done before because of the extent of damage to it, the doctors said. She is the third person at Brigham and Women's Hospital to receive a full face transplant; Dallas Wiens was the first in the United States to have such a surgery in March, also at the hospital. Nash is the second to receive a double-hand transplant at the same time as a face transplant; the first was performed in France in 2009.  That patient died of a heart attack in a later operation. Nash had lost her nose, upper jaw, most of the soft tissue on her face, and both upper and lower lips. She was also left blind. The surgery, which was performed last month, involved removing some tissue and attaching skin and underlying muscle, based on vessels and nerves that provide motor and sensory functions, Pomahac said. The entire hard palate and teeth were also transplanted. The result was ""miraculous,"" said Nash's brother, Steve. The thing Nash is most looking forward to, her brother said, was visiting their favorite hot dog stand. As for the double hand transplant, doctors successfully attached the new hands, but a few days later Nash became sick and her blood pressure fell, causing circulation problems to the new limbs. After a few days, doctors saw that the hands were not thriving and removed them. In the next three months, Nash will regain sensation to her face, and in six to nine months will be able to smile, control her lips and otherwise make facial expressions, Pomahac said. ""All these things will gradually improve,"" he said. Nash skipped her child's high school graduation because she was afraid of taking away from the occasion, but thanks to the transplant, can look forward to being present for college graduation, Pomahac said. The surgery will give her a chance to have a more normal social life, he said.","Charla Nash was attacked by a chimpanzee in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- The man described by counterterrorism officials as al Qaeda's ""military brain,"" Ilyas Kashmiri, was killed in a drone strike Friday night in Pakistan, a spokesman for his group, the jihadist Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami, said. Pakistani and U.S. officials, however, said they have not confirmed Kashmiri's death. Kashmiri was killed, along with some aides, in a strike at 11:15 p.m., spokesman Abu Hanzla Kashar said. ""The oppressor U.S. is our only target and, God willing, we will take revenge on the U.S. soon with full force,"" he said. A senior Pakistani military official said that in all, nine were killed by the drone strike. The official reiterated that they had not confirmed Kashmiri's demise. Kashmiri, who was known to operate in North Waziristan, had moved to South Waziristan and was seen at the site of the attack on Friday, the official said. If confirmed, his death would be the first major kill or capture since Osama Bin Laden, and the highest profile drone target since Beitullah Mehsud in 2009. It could also be seen as an embarrassment for Pakistanis, who have twice in just over one month, had a major al Qaeda figure killed on their territory without their participation. U.S. drones now operate entirely autonomously in Pakistan, a Pakistani intelligence source has told CNN. Whereas before the United States cooperated with Pakistan and used their intelligence, today, the Americans have an intelligence network that allows them to go after terrorists unilaterally. Kashmiri, a veteran jihadist, is considered one of the most dangerous men in the world by counterterrorism officials on three continents. He was commander of ""Brigade 313"" of Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami, which has formed a close relationship with al Qaeda. Kashmiri is also said to have ties with David Coleman Headley, the U.S. citizen who confessed to helping scout . targets for the Mumbai attack in November 2008. After his arrest, Headley said he had twice met Kashmiri. During questioning by India's National Intelligence Agency, which was given access to him in Chicago, Illinois, in June 2010, Headley said he'd been taken to Pakistan's tribal territories to meet Kashmiri early in 2009. A copy of the interrogation obtained by CNN reveals that Kashmiri sent Headley on another trip to survey targets in India. One place he said he videotaped was a bakery that was later attacked in Pune in February 2010. Kashmiri in his early years fought the Indians in the disputed territory of Kashmir and the Russians in Afghanistan, where he lost an eye. He famously escaped from an Indian jail and went to fight with a unit of Pakistan's special forces. Eventually, he fell out with his sponsors in the Pakistani military, and moved his operations to North Waziristan. At one point, he was arrested in connection with an attempt to assassinate Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, in 2003. For reasons unknown, Kashmiri was released a short time later. CNN's Nasir Habib, Nick Paton Walsh and Tim Lister contributed to this report.","NEW: Kashmiri was seen at the location of the strike .

"(CNN)  -- Novak Djokovic shrugged off an injury problem to turn out for Davis Cup holders Serbia in the doubles rubber against Sweden, but it proved in vain as the Wimbledon champion and Nenad Zimonjic slipped to defeat Saturday. Djokovic pulled out of Friday's second singles match in Halmstadt with a knee problem, but he was not missed as his replacement Janko Tipsarevic gave  Serbia a 2-0 lead. But the new world number one, who has lost just one singles match all year, was found wanting in doubles as he and Zimonjic went down 6-4 7-6 7-5 in two hours 24 minutes to unheralded home pair Simon Aspelin and Robert Lindstedt. ""I expected myself to adjust a little bit better in the rhythm of the return -- one of my main weapons wasn't working well as I was missing a lot of returns but that's because of their serves as well, which were great, and they were playing really well at the net,"" Djokovic told the official Davis Cup website. But he added: ""We are coming into the third day 2-1 up which is the most important thing and tomorrow we will try to end this tie.""

"(CNN) -- In recent days, President Barack Obama has applauded efforts to bring former Serb Gen. Ratko Mladic and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi before international courts. It's another indication his administration is more willing than its predecessors to promote the role of international justice in prosecuting those accused of gross human rights abuses. But don't expect the U.S. to sign up to the International Criminal Court anytime soon. The ICC prosecutes individuals accused of crimes against humanity, war crimes, crimes of aggression and genocide. It was set up at an international conference in 1998 and came into being in 2002. Since then, 115 states have ratified the treaty -- though the United States, Russia, China and Israel are not among them. Its very existence has long been a combustible issue in the United States. President Clinton signed the treaty establishing the ICC on January 3, 2000 -- the last day it was open for signature. But at the same time he said he would ""not recommend that my successor submit the treaty to the Senate"" -- saying ""the United States should have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the court before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction."" Conservatives have long loathed the ICC. Sen. Jesse Helms fulminated against it as ""an unprecedented assault on American sovereignty."" President George W. Bush ""unsigned"" the treaty, concerned that U.S. troops and policy-makers alike could face action from a politically-motivated prosecutor. As then-White House spokesman Ari Fleischer put it, ""The president (George W. Bush) thinks the ICC is fundamentally flawed because it puts American servicemen and women at fundamental risk of being tried by an entity that is beyond America's reach, beyond America's laws and can subject American civilians and military to arbitrary standards of justice."" However, the Bush administration did accept the role of the ICC to bring to justice the perpetrators of what it described as genocide in Darfur, Sudan. In 2005, the U.S. abstained rather than veto a Security Council resolution referring allegations of war crimes in Darfur to the ICC. Within the current administration, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appears the most enthusiastic about joining the ICC. Two years ago, at an event in Nairobi, CNN's Fareed Zakharia asked Clinton whether it was more difficult to pursue human rights issues so long as the US was not a signatory. ""That is a great regret, but it is a fact that we are not yet a signatory,"" she said. ""But we have supported the work of the court and will continue to do so under the Obama administration."" On Thursday Clinton was effusive about the capture of Mladic. ""Mladic's arrest serves as a statement to those around the world who would break the law and target innocent civilians: International justice works,"" she said pointedly. Mladic will actually be prosecuted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, but the sentiment is clear and Obama echoed her view. ""From Nuremberg to the present, the United States has long viewed justice for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide as both a moral imperative and an essential element of stability and peace,"" he said in a statement issued at the G8 summit. While not expending political capital at home on a battle to ratify the Rome Treaty that established the court, Obama backed the ICC's decision in 2009 to issue an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in connection with the killings in Darfur. The Obama administration also supports the involvement of the International Criminal Court in Libya. In February, the United States voted for U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970 that referred the situation in Libya to the ICC, stating that ""widespread and systematic attacks currently taking place against the civilian population may amount to crimes against humanity."" The ICC's chief prosecutor has since issued arrest warrants for Moammar Gadhafi, his son Saif al-Arab Gadhafi and Libyan intelligence chief Abdullah Sanussi. Those who want the United States to lend its full weight to the court say fears that U.S. officials and soldiers would find themselves in the dock are overdone. The ICC is designed as a court of last resort, to take action when the host country is unable or unwilling to prosecute individuals accused of grave crimes. They also argue that the Bush administration's refusal to sign up reinforced perceptions overseas that it was ""unilateralist."" In a column for the Los Angeles Times this week, Lt. Col. Butch Bracknell, a serving Marine and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, recalled a conversation he had on a recent training trip to Iraq: ""One Iraqi officer asked me, 'If the United States believes in accountability over impunity, why are you not a party to the International Criminal Court?' I did not have a satisfactory answer."" But Iraq and most other Arab states have also turned their back on the court -- for one reason: Israel. Qatar's attorney general, Al Bin Fetais al Marri, said this week: ""Between the Arab world and the court there is a big problem of misunderstanding,"" saying the court was selective in its investigations. Some African commentators point to the fact that the great majority of arrest warrants issued so far have been for Africans. After the arrest warrant was issued for Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir, a Sudanese official dismissed the court as ""one of the tools of the new colonization."" So despite modest progress (though as yet no convictions) the ICC is far from establishing itself as a universally respected institution. Justice -- like beauty -- is in the eye of the beholder.","ICC prosecutes individuals accused of crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide .

"(Wired) -- A Minnesota hacker that prosecutors described as a ""depraved criminal"" was handed an 18-year prison term Tuesday for unleashing a vendetta of cyberterror that turned his neighbors' lives into a living nightmare. Barry Ardolf, 46, repeatedly hacked into his next-door neighbors' Wi-Fi network in 2009, and used it to try and frame them for child pornography, sexual harassment, various kinds of professional misconduct and to send threatening e-mail to politicians, including Vice President Joe Biden. His motive was to get back at his new neighbors after they told the police he'd kissed their 4-year-old son on the lips. ""Barry Ardolf has demonstrated by his conduct that he is a dangerous man. When he became angry at his neighbors, he vented his anger in a bizarre and calculated campaign of terror against them,"" prosecutor Timothy Rank said in a court filing. ""And he did not wage this campaign in the light of day, but rather used his computer hacking skills to strike at his victims while hiding in the shadows. ""Over months and months, he inflicted unfathomable psychic damage, making the victims feel vulnerable in their own home, while avoiding detection."" Ardolf's attorney, Kevin O'Brien, said in a telephone interview that ""it was a lengthy sentence for a first-time offender."" The defendant also forfeited his house and computer gear. Ardolf had no criminal record, but an investigation revealed that he'd also hijacked the Wi-Fi of other neighbors, and terrorized them as well. A father of two, Ardolf had turned down a 2-year plea agreement last year to charges related to the Biden e-mail. After that, the authorities piled on more charges, including identity theft and two kiddie-porn accusations carrying lifetime sex-offender registration requirements. He pleaded guilty to them all last year. The bizarre tale began in 2009 when Matt and Bethany Kostolnik moved in the house next door to Ardolf, who at the time was a Medronic computer technician living in the Minneapolis suburb of Blaine. On their first day at their new home, the Kostolnik's then-4-year-old son wandered near Ardolf's house. While carrying him back next door, Ardolf allegedly kissed the boy on the lips. ""We've just moved next door to a pedophile,"" Mrs. Kostolnik told her husband. The couple reported Ardolf to the police, angering their creepy new neighbor. ""I decided to 'get even' by launching computer attacks against him,"" Ardolf later wrote in a letter to the judge. Rank, the prosecutor, put it not so mildly: . ""It was apparently this incident which caused the defendant to begin a calculated campaign to terrorize his neighbors, doing whatever he could to destroy the careers and professional reputations of Matt and Bethany Kostolnik, to damage the Kostolniks' marriage, and to generally wreak havoc on their lives,"" he said. Ardolf downloaded Wi-Fi hacking software and spent two weeks cracking the Kostolnik's WEP encryption. Then he used their own Wi-Fi network to create a fake MySpace page for the husband, where he posted a picture of a pubescent girl having sex with two young boys. Under the ""about me"" section, he wrote: . ""I bet my coworker that since I'm a lawyer and a darn great one that I could get away with putting up porn on my site here. I bet that all I have to do is say that there is plausible deniability since anybody could have put this on my site. Like someone hacked my page and added porn without my knowledge. This is reasonable doubt. I'm a darn good lawyer and I can get away with doing anything!"" He then e-mailed the same child porn to one of the husband's co-workers, and sent flirtatious e-mail to women in Mr. Kostolnik's office. ""You are such a fox,"" read one of the e-mails. He sent the message's through the husband's genuine e-mail account. After the husband explained to his law office superiors that he had no idea what was happening, his bosses hired a law firm that examined his network and discovered that an ""unknown"" device had access to it. With Kostolnik's permission, they installed a packet sniffer on his network to try and get to the bottom of the incidents. Then, in May 2009, the Secret Service showed up at Kostolnik's office to ask about several threatening e-mails sent from his Yahoo account, and traced to his IP address, that were addressed to Biden and other politicians. The subject line of one e-mail read: ""This is a terrorist threat! Take this seriously."" ""I swear to God I'm going to kill you!,"" part of the message to Biden said. A forensics computer investigator working for Kostolnik's law firm examined the packet logs, and found the e-mail sessions sending the threats. In the data surrounding the threatening traffic, they found traffic containing Ardolf's name and Comcast account . The FBI got a search warrant for Ardolf's house and computer, and found reams of evidence, including copies of data swiped from the Kostolniks' computer, and hacking manuals with titles such as Cracking WEP Using Backtrack: A Beginner's Guide; Tutorial: Simple WEP Crack Aircracking and Cracking WEP with BackTrack 3 -- Step-by-Step instructions. They also found handwritten notes laying out Ardolf's revenge plans, and a cache of postal mail that Ardolf had apparently stolen from the Kostolniks' mailbox and stashed under his bed. ""One of the manuals had Ardolf's handwriting on it and another had the unique identifying ID for the Kostolniks' router typed into it,"" Rank, the prosector, wrote. Also discovered in Ardolf's possession was the pornographic image posted on MySpace and sent to the husband's co-worker, and evidence that he'd secretly staged a similar harassment campaign against a neighbor at Ardolf's previous home in Brooklyn Park, another Minneapolis suburb. Among other things, he sent that family a postal-mail message consisting of a one-page, color print-out of the family's ""TurboTax"" return with personally identifying information, in addition to several skull images. ""I told you about a year ago that you should be very afraid. I can destroy you at will, you sorry-ass excuse for a human,"" the letter said. The Brooklyn Park family told the FBI they believed Ardolf was upset that their personal care attendants, who looked after their two disabled twin daughters, parked their car in front of his house.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria has set its sights on making multibillion-dollar oil deals with China amid peace moves with militants. Hundreds of militants have laid down their weapons in exchange for a pardon and a job. Lawmakers in the west African country -- one of the world's top producers of oil -- are crafting new money-making changes for its state oil corporation, as officials negotiate multibillion-dollar oil deals with China. At the same time, the government is brokering peace with bandits whose attacks have cost the oil industry millions. Nigeria's minister for state of petroleum, Odein Ajumogobia, talked this month about the developments. The changes aimed at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation will address allegations of corruption and mismanagement, he said. ""Some of the excesses we've seen in the industry are as a result of the lack of regulation,"" Ajumogobia said. ""We are going to make sure that the petroleum directorate, for example, where the minister will reside, is going to be manned by professionals who understand the industry and have the experience."" Nigeria welcomes China's recent interest in investing in Nigeria's oil industry, Ajumogobia added. The state-run China Daily reported in September that the China National Offshore Oil Corporation was negotiating with Nigeria over a $30 billion oil deal. The talks are part of China's oil-buying binge this year. Its government-controlled oil companies have closed or floated a slew of deals all over the world, including billion-dollar deals with Russian oil company Rosneft and Brazil's Petrobras. The Nigerian minister offered few details about negotiations with China. ""There is no deal yet,"" he said. ""We all know the appetite of the Chinese for energy -- a huge population and so on -- and they're looking for oil and Nigeria has a lot of it."" Oil bandits have plagued Nigeria for years, attacking pipelines and cutting production by over 1 million barrels of oil a day. But many of those attacks might end, thanks to a cease-fire with the militant group MEND, or the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta. The truce was negotiated in the summer and was extended in September. MEND has demanded a fairer distribution of oil wealth in the Niger Delta and wants oil revenue reinvested in the region, instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians. Last week, the group said it was calling off the truce, but there have not been renewed attacks. Nigeria hopes to leverage the fragile peace to reap big dollars from its oil industry, Ajumogobia said.","Nigeria aims to make huge oil deals with China and peace with militants .

"HOUSTON, Texas (CNN) -- A comic-book character popular in Mexico for generations has run into a cultural barrier at the border, where Americans see him as a racist caricature. Comic book character Memin Pinguin is ""a disgrace,"" an African-American activist says. For more than 60 years Mexicans have followed the adventures of ""Memin Pinguin."" But the dark-skinned Memin's exaggerated features in ""Memin for President"" came as a shock to Houston, Texas, Wal-Mart shopper Shawnedria McGinty. ""I was like, OK, is that a monkey or a boy?"" McGinty said. ""To me it was an insult."" She'd never heard of ""Memin Pinguin."" She bought a Spanish-English dictionary and tried translating but still didn't like what she saw.  Watch what upset McGinty » . ""So I asked my boyfriend, does that look like a monkey to you?"" she said. ""And we went back and forth and he was like, no, that's a black woman,"" referring to the character's Aunt Jemima-like mother. McGinty and Houston community activist Quannel X want the comic books removed from the stores. ""This is absolutely insensitive toward race, in particular the African-American culture, and also people of color,"" Quannel X said. ""This is poking fun at the physical features of an entire people."" But Mexican readers who grew up following the shenanigans of Memin say critics need to look beyond the cover and understand the stories. ""They will bring a smile to their face because we're so fond of that character,"" said Javier Salas, a Spanish-language talk show host on Chicago radio station WRTO. ""We respect him, we love him. And that's why it's so absurd for us to hear complaints from people who don't know, don't understand Memin."" Memin is a poor Cuban-Mexican kid with bug eyes, thick lips and protruding ears. The mischievous and caring boy helps his mother by selling newspapers and shining shoes. ""We grew up reading, learning and educating ourselves with a lot of the topics they always touched on, which was honesty, justice, tolerance. He was a very unique character,"" Salas said. Wal-Mart spokesman Lorenzo Lopez said the retailer has instructed stores to remove the books from shelves and discontinue sales. ""We received the customer complaint regarding the book, which we knew was based on a popular cartoon character in Mexico. We looked into it further, and we decided to no longer distribute the book and are in the process of removing the books from the stores."" The store has received no other complaints about Memin, Lopez said. ""We have a wide array of products that we provide to Hispanic customers, but when we looked at this more carefully and given the sensitivity of the topic, we thought it was best to no longer carry the book in our stores,"" he said. He did not know how many copies of Memin books the chain had or how long it would take to remove them from displays. Memin is no stranger to controversy. Three years ago, a series of Mexican stamps honoring Memin ignited an international uproar. The stamps were discontinued because of protests from African-American leaders. ""This is saying we respect and regard the African-American community by making them look like Sambos on a stamp?"" the Rev. Al Sharpton said at the time. ""This goes over the line."" Quannel X called the comic book ""a disgrace."" ""Look how they portray his mother, with huge ethnic lips, dark skin, making her look like the big gorilla and him like the little monkey."" But fans of Memin say the valuable lessons of a beloved comic book character tackling real-life problems have been lost in translation.","Wal-Mart pulls popular Mexican books after shopper complains .

"Madrid (CNN) -- A man arrested in Madrid on suspicion of planning an attack against a demonstration to protest the visit of Pope Benedict XVI was a volunteer for the papal visit's organizing committee, a committee senior spokesman said Wednesday. The suspect was arrested on Tuesday at the IFEMA fairgrounds by plainclothes police officers as he was about to receive a backpack and a green shirt worn by volunteers, said the spokesman, Rafa Rubio, the communications director for World Youth Day, told CNN. A police statement Tuesday said a man studying chemistry in Madrid was arrested on suspicion he was planning an attack against a march set to protest the high cost of the visit of the pope to the Spanish capital starting Thursday, the police said. The suspect ""planned to attack using noxious gases and other chemical substances,"" the national police said in a statement. The alleged target was a protest march set for Wednesday evening in Madrid, on the eve of the pope's four-day visit. A police spokeswoman on Wednesday said the suspect is a Mexican national. The police statement said the suspect was studying general organic chemistry at Spain's government-backed Higher Council for Scientific Investigations. Rubio said the suspect, age 24, had completed the process to become a volunteer for World Youth Day and he added that the arresting officers at the volunteer check-in area were so discreet that many in the World Youth Day organization were not aware of what had happened until hours later. The man is no longer a volunteer, Rubio said. ""His apparent thinking is not in the spirit of Christianity,"" Rubio said. ""World Youth Day rejects all violence."" World Youth Day has 30,000 volunteers, many of them from outside of Spain. At the suspect's home in the upscale Salamanca neighborhood of the capital, police seized a laptop computer, a portable memory device and two notebooks with notes about chemical procedures which were not related to his official studies, the statement said. The suspect also allegedly was trying to recruit adherents through the Internet. The police statement said citizen collaboration helped lead police to the man. The cost of the pope's visit to Spain, suffering a deep economic crisis with nearly 21% unemployment, has been top news here in recent days. Benedict XVI is coming to World Youth Day, a weeklong series of religious events that the Roman Catholic Church organizes internationally every three years, last held in Sydney, Australia. Organizers expect at least a million youth for the event and Madrid's streets already are filled with many thousands of young Catholics from around the globe, carrying their national flags. Organizers say the $70 million cost is totally paid by the young people and corporate sponsors -- with no cost to the taxpayer. But others in Spain say there are substantial hidden public costs, including the 10,000 police officers on duty for security, the use of the Cuatro Vientos military air base for Mass, and a discount for visiting Catholic youth on the city's metro, at the same time as regular metro fares have risen sharply. Critics including Spanish groups called Christian Networks, Lay Europe and a third run by atheists convened a protest march over the costs on Wednesday, and they said they expect up to 10,000 people.","Wednesday march meant to criticize costs of pope's visit .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Massive downpours in South Korea -- the heaviest rains in a century -- are blamed for 35 deaths, according to the country's Central Disaster Relief Agency. Heavy rain was still falling Thursday morning across parts of the country. It was raining in some areas around Seoul at a rate of two inches an hour (50 millimeters an hour) and was expected to continue Thursday. The most recent numbers released by the Central Disaster Relief Agency indicated that much of the death toll comes from landslides triggered by the rain.  In Chuncheon, 13 people were killed by landslides, while 15 were killed by the same phenomenon in Seoul.  Five people were still missing, the agency said. Five neighborhoods on the outskirts of Seoul were under evacuation orders. But officials were able to restore electricity to many thousands of homes that had lost power.  Earlier, there were 116,000 homes without power, said the agency.  Early Thursday, that number stood at 1,190. Earlier, the agency warned that hundreds of families had lost their homes. The weather caused major traffic disruptions across portions of the country as well. The Korea Meteorological Agency issued a special heavy rainfall alert for cities in the center of the country.  The forecast called for the downpour to continue at a rate of 60 millimeters (2.4 inches) per hour over the next day. South Korea typically experiences a rainy season during the summer.","NEW: Rain falling at a rate of 2 inches an hour in some areas .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In November we step inside the world of design as show host Becky Anderson searches for the Spirit of Architecture. The ""Gherkin"" designed by Norman Foster is one of the most familiar features on London's skyline. In late October, Barcelona hosts the World Architecture Festival during which the great and good will attempt to choose the best building in the world. CNN will get exclusive access to the event, the nominations, and the jury which includes some of the world's greatest architects. The program will start with an explanation of Barcelona's unique architectural heritage. It will then feature short pieces on six of the architects and the buildings that have been nominated for awards. These profiles have been filmed in Mumbai, Tokyo, Pretoria, Munich, London and Maryland. The program will also feature interviews with some of the world's leading architects including Lord Norman Foster, Zaha Hadid and Wolf D Prix. Foster is the founder of the London-based Foster and Partners architecture company which has recently won a competition to build Virgin Galactic's New Mexico Spaceport Authority Building for space tourism. In September 2007, Foster was awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, for his efforts on the Petronas University of Technology, Bandar Seri Iskandar, Malaysia. Hadid meanwhile has won numerous international architecture awards and is currently involved in the construction of a 17,500-seat aquatics centre for London -- one of the venues being built for the 2012 Olympics. Finally, the Austrian-born Prix, who founded top company Coop Himmelb(l)au is a legend of the architecture world. Prix has scooped many of the top international architectural awards over the last quarter century, and today continues his active involvement in the world of design. Once we have taken you through the festival highlights, at the end of the program the best building in the world will be chosen and we will interview the winning architect.","November's show comes from the World Architecture Festival in Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- You can almost hear them now. The throngs descending on San Diego Comic-Con, ready to devour as much pop culture as they can possibly muster over an extra-long weekend. Officially, the Con begins on Thursday of next week. But, there is that magical time known as Preview Night on Wednesday, when the number one, two and three items on the agenda are to snag as many exclusive goodies as possible... namely, toys! Comic-Con exclusives tend to be nostalgic in nature, and Hasbro's ""Lost Wave"" of ""Indiana Jones"" figures -- revealed for the first time on CNN.com -- is no exception. In honor of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark's"" 30th anniversary, the toy company is adding to the 2008 line of figures, including two new versions of Indy and one of Marion. John Frascotti, chief marketing officer with Hasbro, explained that these figures were never released in stores as planned in 2008. ""They truly are a special edition, because it was never made available to the public,"" he said. ""It ties right into what collectors at Comic-Con are looking for, which is something unique, something special, something that no one else has."" The major and smaller toy companies have been offering up exclusives as part of the explosion in interest in the convention over the past five years. ""It's really a unique event,"" said Frascotti. ""It's a special chance for many elements of our company to interact with people that have a special passion for these brands."" The new Indy figures are sure to get fans drooling at Comic-Con, and here are five more toys that should fly off shelves on Preview Night. -- ""Back to the Future"" Hot Wheels vehicle . Fellow toy giant Mattel also has a major presence on the convention floor, and this year the company is offering fans their very own ""Hot Wheels"" version of a Delorean from the movie ""Back to the Future."" The best part of this, however, is the packaging. It's a mini-version of the briefcase in which Dr. Emmett Brown kept the plutonium! (As for sending the Delorean back to the future -- or the past -- you'll have to figure out how to get it up to 88 mph first.) ""This is a 1/64 scale time machine, which comes in its own plastic display case right in front of the clock tower, with flames coming out of the tires just like it's jumping into time,"" said Scott Neitlich, manager of Boys' Entertainment at Mattel and a collector in his own right. The exclusives like these cater to the hardcore fans, as opposed to casual collectors of all ages. ""We look very carefully at what brands we have that play up to the key demographics at Comic-Con,"" said Neitlich. ""Obviously not every brand is appropriate for Comic-Con. We will go with the obvious ""low-hanging fruit"" brands like Ghostbusters, Masters of the Universe and DC Comics. Hot Wheels is not necessarily a Comic-Con brand, but when you apply it to a sci-fi, geekdom vehicle, like the Delorean, then it becomes a great item for Comic-Con."" -- The ""Revenge of the Jedi"" collection . Taking its name from the original title of ""Return of the Jedi,"" this collection includes special versions of ""Jedi"" characters Boba Fett, Wicket the Ewok, Salacious B. Crumb and an R2-D2 who serves drinks. -- Skystriker with Cobra Commander . This one will basically blow the minds of fans who grew up in the 1980s. Here we have what is a version of the ""Transformers"" character Starscream being piloted by Cobra Commander. ""We're mashing up 'Transformers' and 'G.I. Joe,'"" said Frascotti. ""We're giving the Skystriker plane from 'G.I. Joe' a custom makeover and making it the Decepticon Starscream. Fans of both franchises really like it when we do this type of mashup."" -- Voltron . This year, Mattel will be introducing its very first Voltron figure at the Con, for those who look back fondly at the anime character from the 1980s (recently brought back on a current NickToons series). ""Obviously, there have been many other Voltron figures in the past. What we're offering is the first ever 6-inch scale Voltron,"" said Neitlich. ""This figure makes Voltron at the same size with other figures that collectors may have."" Best of all, Voltron comes with his blazing sword. -- ""Dexter"" Dark Defender . Aside from the nostalgia factor, there are some more recent properties that do well on Preview Night. Last year's ""Dexter"" bobblehead was a hot seller for smaller toy company Entertainment Earth. This year, they've created a Dexter action figure complete with its own card packaging showing star Michael C. Hall. ""America's Favorite Serial Killer"" is certainly for the grownup collectors out there. Whether you're there to relive a part of your childhood or celebrate genre entertainment in the present, fans can usually find at least one thing that they're dying to part with their hard-earned money to get, and in the age of fan conventions, companies continue to tailor their special-release toys like these to what the geek crowd wants. So if your colleague comes back to work after his trip to San Diego with a bobblehead TARDIS, now you know it came from Preview Night.","Fans look forward to San Diego Comic-Con exclusives every year .

"Washington (CNN) -- Top administration and congressional officials are expected to continue working this week on a measure to raise the federal debt ceiling by up to $2.5 trillion, embracing a version of a fallback plan designed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to avoid a potentially catastrophic default. At the same time, GOP leaders are planning a series of votes on a proposed balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and sharp caps on future spending.  The bills have no chance of clearing Congress or winning the approval of President Barack Obama, but would allow Republicans to demonstrate their preference for steps favored by their party's conservative base. The maneuvering will take place against a backdrop of heightened anxiety as fears rise that Washington will not be able to pay its bills starting next month.  If Congress fails to raise the current $14.3 trillion debt ceiling by August 2, Americans could be hit with rising interest rates, a plummeting dollar, and increasingly jittery financial markets, among other things. The seriousness of the overall situation was reinforced Thursday when a major credit rating agency, Standard and Poor's, said it was placing the United States' sovereign rating on ""CreditWatch with negative implications."" Moody's Investors Services -- another major rating agency -- said Wednesday that it would put the sterling bond rating of the United States on review for possible downgrade. Obama warned last week that he could not guarantee older Americans will receive their Social Security checks next month if a deal is not reached in time.  Republicans accused the president of resorting to scare tactics. Nevertheless, the two sides continued their talks over the weekend.  Obama met at the White House Sunday with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, according to a spokesman for Boehner. ""We're making progress,"" the president said Monday.  ""We can't let politics stand in the way of doing the right thing."" It ""was never going to be easy (and) it certainly doesn't look easy today,"" added White House spokesman Jay Carney. However, Carney added that all the congressional leaders in the talks were committed to reaching a deal, whether a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement sought by Obama, a smaller version or the fallback option that focuses on raising the debt ceiling. ""We have to ensure that there is a fallback provision; that there is a measure through which Congress will act and we can ensure that the United States will not default,"" Carney said. ""And the leaders in that room are unanimously in support of doing that."" McConnell's plan appears to have gained momentum over the past few days as hopes have faded for a grand bargain including tax hikes on the wealthy and reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.  The Republican leader's proposal would give Obama the power to raise the borrowing limit by a total of $2.5 trillion, but also require three congressional votes on the issue before the 2012 general election. Specifically, Obama would be required to submit three requests for debt ceiling hikes -- a $700 billion increase and two $900 billion increases.  Along with each request, the president would have to submit a list of recommended spending cuts exceeding the debt ceiling increase.  The cuts would not need to be enacted in order for the ceiling to rise. Congress would vote on -- and presumably pass -- ""resolutions of disapproval"" for each request.  Obama would likely veto each resolution.  Unless Congress manages to override the president's vetoes -- considered highly unlikely -- the debt ceiling would increase. The unusual scheme would allow most Republicans and some more conservative Democrats to vote against any debt ceiling hike while still allowing it to clear. McConnell, R-Kentucky, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, are also working on two critical additions to the plan, according to congressional aides in both parties.  One would add up to roughly $1.5 trillion in spending cuts agreed to in earlier talks led by Vice President Joe Biden; the other would create a commission meant to find more major spending cuts, tax increases and entitlement reforms. Changes agreed to by the commission -- composed of an equal number of House and Senate Democrats and Republicans -- would be subject to a strict up-or-down vote by Congress.  No amendments would be allowed. Sources say the panel would be modeled after the Base Closing and Realignment Commission, which managed to close hundreds of military bases that Congress could not otherwise bring itself to shut down. As congressional leaders continue laying the groundwork for the plan, Republicans are moving ahead with a more partisan measure to ""cut, cap and balance"" future budgets.   The plan includes major spending cuts, caps on future spending as a percentage of economic production, and a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The White House released a statement Monday promising a veto if the GOP plan reaches Obama's desk. ""Instead of pursuing an empty political statement and unrealistic policy goals, it is necessary to move beyond politics as usual and find bipartisan common ground,"" the statement read. Boehner called it ""disappointing"" that ""the White House would reject this common-sense plan."" ""If we are going to raise the debt limit and avoid default, the White House must be willing to demonstrate more courage than we have seen to date,"" the speaker said in a written statement. The GOP initiative stands in sharp contrast to Obama's stated preference for a package of roughly $4 trillion in savings over the next decade composed of spending reforms and tax increases on the rich. ""I'm a little frustrated that (administration officials are) never willing to be specific about the reductions in spending that they would be willing to do,"" conservative Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, said Sunday. ""The president always just holds out this idea that, well, if you'll raise taxes, and he is very specific about the taxes he wants to raise, then (he) might be willing to look at cuts elsewhere,"" Kyl said. ""Well, of course, that's just not good enough.  So, the point I'm trying to make is when the president says he's willing to compromise, understand why Republican leaders have been pretty reluctant to go along with this deal because we frankly don't know where the spending reductions come, but we do know where the taxes are."" Republicans have repeatedly insisted that they are the only side offering concrete proposals to address mounting deficits and the federal debt. Democrats in turn have belittled the GOP's push for a balanced budget amendment, a perennial favorite of conservatives. ""This notion that we somehow have to change the Constitution to do what we were elected to do is just plain wrong,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""Bottom line is, those who want to push a balanced budget amendment are saying, 'I can't promise you that I won't steal again, but I will vote for the Ten Commandments.' "" At the heart of the current debate is Obama's call for more tax revenue by allowing tax cuts from the Bush presidency to expire at the end of 2012 for families making more than $250,000.  His plan would keep the lower tax rates for Americans who earn less. Republicans insist they will not agree to any tax increases, arguing that such a move would derail an already weak economic recovery. Obama noted last week he is not looking to raise any taxes until 2013 or later.  In exchange, the president said, he wants to ensure that the current progressive nature of the tax code is maintained, with higher-income Americans assessed higher tax rates. But resistance to higher taxes is now a bedrock principle for most Republicans, enforced by conservative crusaders such as political activist Grover Norquist. Norquist's group, Americans for Tax Reform, has sponsored a high-profile pledge to oppose any tax increase. The pledge has been signed by more than 230 House members and 40 senators, almost all of them Republicans. CNN's Ted Barrett, Kate Bolduan, Candy Crowley, Ana Sebescen, Deirdre Walsh and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","NEW: White House spokesman says all the leaders in the talks agree on the need for a deal .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Two more blasts struck Nigeria on Monday, bringing the total to five since President Goodluck Jonathan was inaugurated Sunday. One blast Monday was directed at a military patrol in Maiduguri, in northern Nigeria, military spokesman Mohammed Yerima said. No casualties were reported. The other was in Zaria, also in northern Nigeria. It was the second blast in Zaria in less than a day. On Sunday, an explosion struck a beer parlor in Zaria, wounding two people, National Emergency Management Agency spokesman Yushau Shauib said. There were no casualties reported in the bombings Monday. The other two blasts Sunday were at a market in Bauchi, east of Zaria, and a beer hall in Zuba, on the outskirts of the Nigerian capital of Abuja. In the Bauchi explosion, at least 13 people were killed and 20 were wounded, Shauib said. In the Zuba blast, two people were killed and 11 others were hospitalized, Shauib said. In recent weeks, the African nation has been rocked by a series of bombings thought to be engineered by Boko Haram, an Islamic group that has challenged Nigeria's government. Explosions in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno killed a few and wounded dozens in late April in the days leading up to the national governorship elections. Police described the attacks as attempts to intimidate voters who had picked Jonathan. Northern Muslims in some areas charged that the presidential election was rigged. Armed protesters in the region took to the streets chanting the name of former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, the main opposition front-runner. This is Jonathan's first full term. As vice president, he took over the presidency in May 2010 upon the death of then-President Umaru Yar'Adua, who had suffered from a heart condition.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The City Council of Fullerton, California, approved Tuesday evening the hiring of an independent consultant to reform the city's police force and review last month's arrest and subsequent death of a homeless schizophrenic man, a spokeswoman said. Before a gallery of residents angry about the death, the council voted 5-0 to award a one-year $50,000 contract to Michael J. Gennaco, a consultant whose rate is $260 an hour, to examine the police department's policies and practices, city spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer Mudrick said. The council then approved 4-1 a second contract, also for up to a year, paying Gennaco $30,000 to prepare a public report looking at the July 5 incident involving police and the death of Kelly Thomas, Mudrick said. Gennaco told the council he will begin investigating the death after the Orange County District Attorney's office completes its own inquiry into the incident, Mudrick said. Gennaco is currently chief attorney for a civilian oversight committee created by the Los Angeles County supervisors to monitor the sheriff's department. Thomas, 37, died five days after what the Orange County district attorney has called ""a violent and desperate struggle"" last month with Fullerton police. Meanwhile, a Los Angeles attorney said he is planning to file a police brutality lawsuit in federal court this week against Fullerton officers in a new unrelated case. But one of the officers in that case was also involved in the Thomas arrest, said the attorney, Garo Mardirossian. Mardirossian is also representing Thomas' father, Ron, who is alleging that his son was a victim of police brutality and has notified Fullerton city officials that he plans to pursue legal action against them. In the second alleged instance of police brutality, Veth Mam, 31, of Orange County, California, had an altercation with Fullerton police officers in October that was recorded on his iPhone and posted on YouTube. Mam wasn't seriously injured, Mardirossian said. Mam, who works in an automation factory, was acquitted of battery against an officer and resisting arrest -- both misdemeanors -- last month, Mardirossian said. On Tuesday, acting Fullerton police chief Kevin Hamilton, named to the post last week, said he was concerned about the Mam case based upon information brought to his attention. He has ordered an internal affairs investigation ""to determine what happened that evening in October 2010 and the court case this year,"" said police spokesman Sgt. Andrew Goodrich . ""There is a strong possibility that we arrested the wrong person that night (Veth Mam),"" Goodrich said in an e-mail to CNN. Mardirossian claims the iPhone video by Mam contradicted the police report and an officer's testimony in the case. How Fullerton police officers write their reports is also a matter of controversy in the Thomas case because officers were allowed to view a videotape of the Thomas arrest before filing their reports, Mardirossian said Tuesday. In the federal lawsuit to be filed later this week, Mam will claim conspiracy to falsify arrest reports, conspiracy to violate the civil rights of a citizen and police brutality, Mardirossian said. Mardirossian said the suit will support his claim that the Fullerton Police Department engages in a ""pattern or practice"" of civil rights violations. Fullerton Deputy City Attorney James Touchstone declined to comment Tuesday on the anticipated legal actions by Thomas' father and by Mam. Touchstone and police spokesman Goodrich also declined to comment on Mardirossian's accusation that one Fullerton police officer was also involved in both cases. Mardirossian identified that officer, but city officials declined to confirm the name Tuesday. The attorney for the six officers didn't return phone calls Tuesday. Meanwhile, Thomas' father and some angry residents have been pressing city officials to release a videotape of the six Fullerton police officers engaged in the arrest and alleged beating. City officials have declined to release the tape. In the July 5 incident, six officers responded to reports that a man was trying to break into cars near a bus depot, according to police. The officers have been placed on involuntary paid administrative leave, and city officials haven't released their names. Police Chief Michael Sellers has also taken a paid medical leave, as two of the city's five council members have called upon him to resign. Gennaco has said he will look at how Fullerton police officers wrote their reports only after watching the videotape. He said police departments have different policies on whether officers can look at their tapes before writing their reports. Gennaco said taxpayers could expect police ""reform"" out of his work. Meanwhile, there are two external investigations into the death, by the FBI and the Orange County district attorney's office. The FBI is looking at civil rights violations. Also, residents notified the city that they are going to start a recall petition drive for the other three members on the city council: Mayor F. Richard Jones, Mayor Pro Tem Don Bankhead and Councilman Pat McKinley. The mayor and mayor pro tem positions are one-year terms rotated among the five council members, officials said. CNN's Irving Last, Stan Wilson and Marie Malzberg contributed to this report.","NEW: The Fullerton City Council approves two contracts totaling $80,000 .

"Dusseldorf, Germany -- While America gets ready for the finale of ""American Idol"" and tunes into hot new shows such as NBC's ""The Voice,"" Europe is busy watching the continent's annual vocal competition that many say gave rise to the entire phenomena of televised singing throw-downs: Eurovision. Since 1956, European nations have sent representative artists and songs to battle for the boasting rights as top songsmiths. On Tuesday evening the first semi-final of 2011 took place in a Dusseldorf, Germany, arena. And just like on U.S. shows such as ""Idol,"" losers went home and winners advanced. The only difference is that in this competition, entire countries are left saddened when songs fail to impress the voting public in Europe -- and members of a jury: The vote is split 50/50 between fans and a panel of experts. Serbia, Greece, Lithuania, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Switzerland, Hungary, Iceland, Russia and Finland all advanced Tuesday evening, while countries such as Turkey, Norway, Armenia, Portugal, Malta, Croatia, Albania and Poland were sent packing. The biggest shockers were arguably Iceland's inclusion and Norway's exclusion from the finals. The winners advance to Saturday's final, where they will join the top contenders from Thursday's semi-final in an anticipated live broadcast of 25 artists from 25 countries singing their country's representative tunes in a winner-takes-all evening that is among Europe's most watched events of the year. Between 100 million and 120 million are expected to tune in this year for all three events. Germany -- last year's winner -- the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain all automatically qualify for Saturday's final as members of the ""Big Five."" Americans largely ignore Eurovision, as they have little reason to pay attention: U.S. broadcasters do not show the telecast and America has no official entry. But this year, some in the United States are taking more interest than ever, thanks to a fresh crop of singers and increased exposure of the Eurovision brand brought about via Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. To be sure, the European Broadcasting Union has a long way to go to gain fans in North America. For starters, they have no official media partner to show the semi-finals this week or the finals on Saturday. Fewer than 20 U.S. journalists were accredited out of over 2000 total print, television, radio and Web journalists at Eurovision in 2011. France, by comparison, has around 125 journalists, many representing major news outlets. Still, interest in Eurovision is up in the U.S. The number of American media outlets attending Eurovision this year has more than doubled from 2010 and Eurovision officials say website traffic from North America overall is comparable to last year and even up slightly. Many view the competition as a curiosity. This year's crop at Eurovision has already produced two giggle-inducing entrants: Israel's official song in contention this year is simply titled ""Ding Dong"" while Belarus went with the not-exactly-subtly titled ""I Love Belarus."" But the level of songwriting across the board seems to be on the rise at Eurovision. After all, this is where ABBA first made their mark on the world stage and every year great songs rise above the din at the event, with several this year piquing interest -- many are raving about a song from Azerbaijan. This year's hopefuls might surprise curious American pop fans. Blue's ""I Can,"" from the U.K. and Eric Saade's ""Popular"" from Sweden, rival anything on U.S. Top 40 radio at the moment, with slick production and memorable hooks. It remains to be seen just who will get the final nod Saturday. Odds makers have France and the United Kingdom atop many lists at the moment, but that could change. Whatever transpires at Eurovision this week, one thing is certain: It won't be dull.","European nations compete in friendly music competition at Eurovision .

"(CNN) -- A man was killed by a grizzly bear Wednesday morning at Yellowstone National Park, according to the National Park Service. The visitor was hiking with his wife along the Wapiti Lake trail when he surprised a female bear with her cubs, the park service said. The bear attacked and fatally wounded the man in an attempt to defend her cubs. A group of nearby hikers called police after they heard the victim's wife crying for help. The name of the victim is being withheld pending notification of family members. There have been no reports of bear encounters along or near the Wapiti Lake trail this season, park spokesman Al Nash said in the statement. A bear warning sign was posted at the head of the trail because of known bear activity along access points. All trails and back-country campsites have been closed until further notice. Park rangers are working to clear the area of all back-country users. ""It is extremely unfortunate that this couple's trip into the Yellowstone backcountry has ended in tragedy,"" said Dan Wenk, superintendent of Yellowstone National Park. ""Our heart goes out to the family and friends of the victim as they work to cope with their loss."" This is the first bear-caused human fatality in Yellowstone since 1986, Nash said. Bear attacks are extremely rare. No visitors were injured by bears in the park in 2010. Park visitors are advised to hike in groups of three or more people and to be alert for bears and make noise in blind spots. It is not known if the victim or his wife was carrying bear pepper spray at the time of the incident. Bear pepper spray has been effective in stopping aggressive bears.","A man, traveling with his wife in Yellowstone, was killed by a grizzly .

"(CNN) -- While suspended star striker Wayne Rooney was recovering from a hair transplant, England's hopes of automatic qualification for Euro 2012 suffered a blow on Saturday as Switzerland claimed at 2-2 draw at London's Wembley Stadium. The balding Manchester United player, who was booked in March's win over Wales to trigger the ban, revealed on Twitter before kickoff that he had used his time off to visit a hair specialist. ""Just to confirm to all my followers I have had a hair transplant. I was going bald at 25, why not. I'm delighted with the result,"" he wrote on the social networking website. ""It's still a bit bruised and swollen when it dies down u will be first to see it. Anyone recommend any good hair gel. Haha."" France held by Belarus in Euro 2012 qualifier . It was more serious for Fabio Capello's team, who had to come from two goals down after goalkeeper Joe Hart was badly caught out by two free-kicks from Tranquillo Barnetta just after half an hour. Frank Lampard reduced the deficit with a penalty before halftime and his replacement Ashley Young leveled soon after coming on at the interval. The result meant Montenegro joined England on 11 points at the top of Group G after five games after also being held at home, 1-1 by Bulgaria. Bulgaria and the Swiss have little chance of earning second place and a berth in the playoffs, with both nations having five points with three matches left. England next travel to Bulgaria on September 2, when Montenegro visit pointless bottom nation Wales. Hart looked on in bemusement as Barnetta's curling set-piece drifted past his defenders and into the far corner in the 32nd minute, and he was caught out at the near post by the same player from wide out on the left soon after. However, Lampard made it 2-1 in the 36th minute when Jack Wilshere was fouled in the box by his Arsenal teammate Johan Djourou, and Young leveled six minutes after his halftime introduction after being set up by fellow substitute Leighton Baines. Striker Darren Bent blazed over the bar when he should have hit the target for England with 20 minutes left, and both teams went close in the closing stages. England manager Capello said his players were tired after a long season. ""You can see the Switzerland players were fresher. They have had a different season,"" the Italian said. ""We had three clear chances to score goals but at the end of the game, in the last 10 minutes, some players were without energy."" Slovakia, Russia and the Republic of Ireland are tied on 13 points at the top of Group B after all three won on Saturday. Slovakia edged a 1-0 win at home to bottom nation as striker Robert Vittek scored the only goal in the 63rd minute. Russia triumphed 3-1 at home to Armenia thanks to a hat-trick from striker Roman Pavlyuchenko, while the Irish defeated Macedonia 2-0 away as skipper Robbie Keane netted both goals to pass a half-century in internationals. Greece returned to the top of Group F with a 3-1 victory over Malta, with two goals from young attacking talent Giannis Fetfatzidis and another by teenage debutant Kyriakos Papadopoulos. That moved the Greeks a point above Croatia, who were joined on 12 by Israel following that nation's 2-1 win in Latvia. Midfielder Yossi Benayoun and Tal Ben Haim, with a penalty, scored in the first half to keep Israel's qualification bid alive. Group H also has a three-way tie at the top with Portugal, Denmark and Norway battling for automatic qualification. Portugal beat Norway 1-0 at home as striker Helder Postiga scored the only goal eight minutes after halftime. Denmark joined them on 10 points, winning 2-0 in Iceland thanks to second-half goals from Lasse Schone and Christian Eriksen. In a friendly international, five-time World Cup winners Brazil drew 0-0 with three-time runners-up the Netherlands. The home team had midfielder Ramires sent off in the 79th minute for his second booking. Current world champions Spain crushed the United States 4-0 in Massacheusetts as Santi Cazorla scored twice, with the other goals coming from fellow striker Alvaro Negredo and his halftime replacement Fernando Torres. The U.S. upset Spain in the semifinals 2009 Confederations Cup, but this time conceded three goals in 13 minutes from just before the half-hour mark. Spain visited in a warm-up match for the Americans ahead of the CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament which the U.S. is hosting this month.","England held 2-2 at home by Switzerland in absence of suspended Wayne Rooney .

"London, England (CNN) -- The diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks throw up revealing details about how the world looks at Britain's royal family, as well as highlighting the occasional episode when erstwhile-royal behavior forces its way on to the agenda of international meetings. There is a frank assessment of Prince Charles by the political director of the Commonwealth group of countries. Amitav Banerji tells an officer at the U.S. Embassy in London that the prince does not ""command the same respect"" among Commonwealth members as does Queen Elizabeth, according to a cable sent on June 11, 2009. Banerji says Commonwealth officials were trying to get the prince ""more involved"" in the organization, according to the cable. It goes on to report Banerji saying the issue of whether Prince Charles would succeed his mother as head of the Commonwealth would be dealt with after the queen passes. There is no rule stipulating the British monarch must head the organization, the cable notes; nor is there any procedure for selecting a new head. Approached by CNN for a response, a spokesman for the Commonwealth said it did not comment on privileged communication. Prince Charles also crops up in a cable sent from Amman, Jordan, on February 19, 2004. This time the assessment is less frank and rather more bizarre. The cable details a briefing to the U.S. ambassador by the then-Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher, who is describing what the cable calls the ""stark ignorance"" shown by Syria towards the rest of the world. By way of an example, he cites comments by Syria's Foreign Minister Farouq Sharaa, to Jordanian officials, that Prince Charles was on the point of being implicated in a Scottish judicial investigation into Princess Diana's death; as a result, said the Syrian minister, the prince was about to embark on a trip to Iraq and Iran ""to seek the support of the Muslim world."" ""They just don't get it,"" Muasher told the U.S. ambassador, referring to the Syrians. And Prince Charles' one-time sister-in-law, Sarah Ferguson, landed Britain's former Foreign Minister David Miliband, in hot water, according to a cable described in the Guardian newspaper but not yet published by WikiLeaks. The newspaper, which has had sight of the cables in advance of their publication, reports that a documentary made by the former Duchess of York about the treatment of disabled children in Turkish care centers ""topped the agenda"" at talks between Miliband and his Turkish counterpart, Ali Babacan, in November 2008. Turkey said the documentary, which saw Sarah Ferguson disguise her identity to gain access to the centers, was aimed at compromising its efforts to join the EU, the paper says. Miliband is reported to have reminded Babacan that as Ferguson was no longer a member of the royal family, ""her activities could no longer be controlled.""","Commonwealth officer says prince doesn't ""command the same respect"" as the queen .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of spectators turned out to cheer on competitors in the 2011 Dakar Rally as the historic race got underway in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Saturday. The 15-day race will see 407 vehicles (of 430 original entries) embark on a grueling 13 stages and attempt to cover a distance of 9,500 kilometers (5,900 miles), before crossing the finish line back in the Argentine capital on January 15. A total of 140 cars, 170 motorbikes, 67 lorries and 30 quadbikes started stage one of the race from the Buenos Aires' Avenue of July 9. All competitors are heading northwest to Victoria, in the Argentine province of Entre Rios, 377 kilometer (234 miles) away. The race will begin in earnest on Sunday with the second stage to Cordoba. Racers will cross the border into Chile on Wednesday heading north towards the border with Peru before heading back south through the Andes mountains and on to the Atacama Desert. From there, they will head east and back into Argentina for the closing stages of the race. Fear and loathing in South America . The rally which began in 1978 was traditionally held in Europe and Africa. But after concerns about terrorism forced the cancellation of the 2008, the rally was relocated to Argentina and Chile the following year. Last year's winner in the car race, Spain's Carlos Sainz -- driving for Volkswagen Motorsport -- is back to defend his title, but he'll face a stiff challenge from the likes of Nasser al-Attiyah from Qatar and Mark Miller from the United States. But the Spaniard and former double world rally champion remains undaunted by the competition. ""I'll only be thinking about how I'm going to race and to do my job well. As usual, I'll be racing at my pace and in my own special way,"" Sainz told www.dakar.com on Friday.

"Washington (CNN) -- Usually in Washington it's Republicans and Democrats battling each other but on Thursday night they joined together to battle a common enemy: the Washington Press Corps. In the third annual Congressional Women's Softball game, members from both sides of the aisle came together to play the Capitol Hill Press Corps to raise about $50,000 for the Young Survival Coalition, a group that assists young women facing breast cancer. Rep. Laura Richardson, D-California, started things off with a three-run home run in the first inning but the press women came back to eventually tie things up in the top of the 6th inning, 4-4. The nail biter went down to the bottom of the 7th and last inning. CNN's Erika Dimmler made an incredible outfield somersault catch to make it two outs but then Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida, came to the plate. Wasserman Schultz, whose jersey simply read ""DWS"", made the incredible game winning hit, driving in Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-California, to win the game 5-4. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a long time New York Yankees, fan threw out the first pitch as the crowd cheered her on.

"Ras Lanuf, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan opposition fighters marched west Sunday, seizing control of two key cities, CNN observed, and gaining ground as coalition airstrikes continued to pound the North African nation. Rebel forces told CNN that forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi pulled back from Ras Lanuf. A CNN crew in the city witnessed damaged vehicles on the outskirts of the town, though the town appeared to have avoided major destruction. There were some homes that appeared burned, and others had gaping holes. The damage looked to be from fighting when Gadhafi's forces had originally pushed the rebels out. There were no clashes reported Sunday, rebels said. Rebels also appeared to have taken control of the key oil town of Brega, a CNN team on the scene observed. Some opposition fighters focused on securing Brega's entrance while others traveled in trucks heading west, encountering little resistance along the way. The gains signify that the rebel forces have reclaimed all the territory they lost to Gadhafi's forces at the start of the war. The opposition comeback was paved in part by coalition airstrikes designed to stop the killings of civilians, and that have hit Gadhafi's forces. Coalition airstrikes continued Sunday as NATO approved an operations plan that will shift the entire Libyan military mission to alliance command, officials said. The new NATO mandate will begin in two to three days, NATO officials said, allowing the current coalition, led by the United States, the United Kingdom and France, to stand down. Coalition officials say the airstrikes are aimed at enforcing a no-fly zone and protecting civilians in Libya. But Libyan government officials have countered that claim, arguing that coalition forces only target troops loyal to Gadhafi. ""The rebels are making their advance and no one is stopping them. And no one is even talking to them or saying, 'Where are you going?' or 'Why are you taking offensive positions and attacking the Libyan army and Libyan cities?' "" Moussa Ibrahim, a Libyan government spokesman, told reporters in Tripoli. He accused NATO of ""starving the Libyan population to get Libya on its knees to beg for mercy."" ""They are trying to weaken our spirits. They are not trying to protect civilians,"" he said. Ibrahim added that 29 people were injured Sunday when a ""peace convoy"" came under attack by ""armed militias."" No one was killed, he said. While the opposition rolled westward, the city of Misrata -- located between the rebels' current position and Tripoli -- remained under siege by government forces for the 11th consecutive day, an eyewitness told CNN. The city remained under shelling and pro-Gadhafi snipers remained on rooftops, he said. Pro-Gadhafi forces appeared to be shelling strategic places like the port and a main industrial area, he said. Busloads of soldiers have arrived in the city dressed as civilians, the witness said. The soldiers ostensibly came to participate in a peace march, but it appeared to be a ploy to set up positions around the city, he said. ""The snipers are firing into the main streets and into the back streets. There are also tanks,"" he said. According to him, 116 civilians have been killed in the last week. A doctor in Misrata working at a hospital said eight civilians were killed and 22 injured in the violence Sunday. CNN could not immediately confirm his report independently. French warplanes on Sunday led airstrikes on armored vehicles and on a large ammunitions depot in the regions of Misrata and Zintan, according to the French Ministry of Defense. After Ras Lanuf, the next major city on the highway toward the capital of Tripoli is Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte. Rebel forces told CNN they expect a long and bloody battle there. In Tripoli on Sunday, CNN's Nic Robertson reported he heard six loud explosions and saw heavy anti-aircraft tracer fire. The CNN team there heard at least four explosions early Monday, followed again by anti-aircraft fire. Meanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that Gadhafi is placing the bodies of people his regime has killed at the sites of some missile strikes by the U.S.-led coalition, according to intelligence. In an interview broadcast Sunday on the CBS program ""Face the Nation,"" Gates said he was unaware of coalition attacks causing civilian casualties. ""The truthof the matter is we have trouble coming up with proof of any civilian casualties that we have been responsible for,"" Gates said in the interview conducted Saturday. ""But we do have a lot of intelligence reporting about Gadhafi taking the bodies of the people he's killed and putting them at the sites where we've attacked."" Asked how often it has happened, Gates replied: ""We have a number of reports of that."" Determined to topple Gadhafi's nearly 42-year reign, rebels have said they will continue the westward march to Tripoli. ""The dictator has chosen to take the bloody road. ... We encourage him to leave or we will force his removal,"" opposition spokesman Col. Ahmed Omar Bani told reporters Saturday. State television reported that civilian and military locations in Sabha and Gadhafi's birthplace of Sirte were bombed overnight. Coalition planes flew at least 96 airstrike missions in a 24-hour period that ended Saturday, according to statistics released by the Pentagon, and leaders reported damage to Gadhafi's ground forces. Opposition fighters chanted gratitude for the coalition's support Saturday after they wrested control of Ajdabiya, considered a gateway to Libya's vast oil fields and a stopping point en route to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. The coalition's air campaign continued Saturday, further limiting loyalist movements. French warplanes destroyed at least five Libyan combat planes and two helicopters over a 24-hour period, the Ministry of Defense said. Explosions and airstrikes were also reported in Tripoli, Tarhunah and Misrata.

"(CNN) -- Brazil secured their first win of the 2011 Copa America with a 4-2 victory against Ecuador on Wednesday to seal their progression to the quarterfinals of the competition in Argentina. Forwards Alexandre Pato and Neymar both scored twice in response to a brace from Ecuador's Felipe Caicedo to ensure Mario Manezes' Brazil finished top of Group B. The eight-time tournament winners will now play Paraguay, who qualified from the same group as one of the two best-performing third-place teams. The game's opening goal arrived after 27 minutes, when AC Milan's Pato met Andre Santos' cross with a powerful header. Inter Milan goalkeeper Julio Cesar gifted Ecuador an equalizer 10 minutes later, when the 31-year-old allowed Caicedo's drive to slip through his legs into the net. Santos' Neymar put Brazil back in front four minutes into the second half, when he latched onto Ganso's pass to coolly place the ball beyond Marcelo Elizaga in the Ecuador goal. But Ecuador responded once again, Levante's Caicedo finding the bottom corner with a crisp shot from the edge of the penalty area. Pato, 21, restored the five-time world champions' advantage with his second goal of the game, the former Internacional striker reacting quickest after Elizaga spilled Neymar's drive in the 61st minute. It was Neymar who confirmed Brazil's triumph with 19 minutes remaining when he converted from close-range after right-back Maicon's low cross. Brazil face Paraguay in the city of La Plata on Sunday, after Gerardo Martino's side shared an exciting 3-3 draw with Venezuela. Venezuela took the lead with five minutes gone when forward Salomon Rondon found the net with a stinging 20-yard shot. Defender Antolin Alcaraz equalized for Paraguay when he slammed home following a goalmouth scramble, and Borussia Dortmund's Lucas Barrios edged Paraguay ahead with a scrambled effort just past the hour mark. Cristian Riveros looked to have made sure of the win for Paraguay with his 85th minute strike, but two goals in the last couple of minutes from Getafe's Miku and defender Grenddy Perozo earned Venezuela a draw.

"Zintan, Libya (CNN) -- Forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi have unleashed their biggest attack yet against a rebel stronghold in the mountains of western Libya, one of the Libyan leader's former generals said Friday. The attack began at dawn Thursday, the former commander said. He now commands rebels in Zintan, using the name Hajj Usama. The attack began Thursday when about 150 of Gadhafi's infantry troops began firing on three fronts near Zintan, he said. They were supported by about 40 vehicles, including long-range ""Grad"" rocket launchers and 14.5 mm heavy machine guns with a range of 6 kilometers. Zintan lies about 90 miles southwest of the capital, Tripoli. Zintan, population 40,000, is at the eastern tip of a 170-mile ribbon of rebel-held mountains that stretch westward from the Tunisian border. After decades in the Libyan army, including a tour of duty in neighboring Chad, Hajj Usama said he now despises his former commander in chief, whom he called a terrorist. ""He's never used infantry like this,"" said the trim, gray-bearded rebel commander. In previous battles, Hajj Usama said, Gadhafi's artillery forces had taken over nearby civilian housing in Zuwail al Bagul and shelled from a distance. Gadhafi's forces simultaneously attacked Thursday on three fronts, Hajj Usama said -- to the north of Zintan, firing Grad rockets into the eastern part of the nearby town of Rayayna, and attacking to the southeast and to the east of Zintan. In response, he dispatched hundreds of fighters to cut off Gadhafi's advance, Hajj Usama said. As of Friday night, one rebel was dead and three were wounded, one of them critically, he said. Fresh trenches cut deep in the stark, red sand here underscore the rebels' readiness to continue defending the town. The absence of Gadhafi's forces has buoyed the confidence of the rebel fighters. Some of the fighters who returned late Friday from the front lines -- crammed into the backs of pickup trucks -- appeared to be school-age. They carried only a handful of weapons, a few hunting rifles and old, bolt-action shotguns. Nevertheless, Hajj Osama said, ""they are keen and determined to fight for their freedom."" The attack that began Thursday, he speculated, was intended to regain control of Rayayna, population 12,000. Residents east of the town had ""declared their support for the rebels a month ago,"" he said, while the rest of the town remains loyal to Gadhafi and his former head of internal security, Nasar al Mabout. Hajj Usama said al Mabout lives there. Since the raids began, Hajj Usama said, he has lost contact with rebels in Rayayna with the exception of one commander who managed to make the dangerous journey to Zintan after his house was destroyed in the shelling. As dusk fell Friday the shelling visible earlier from the roofs of Zintan abated. But shortly before 10 p.m., the attack resumed with sporadic barrages of gunfire. The rebels said the night shelling may have been intended to terrorize Zintan's residents so they would flee. Some have, but most were staying to brave out the battle they fear is far from over, Hajj Usama said. Early Friday, NATO jets pounded Libyan ports, destroying eight of Gadhafi's warships, an alliance spokesman said. NATO targeted the ships in Tripoli, Al-Khums and Sirte after it was apparent that Gadhafi's forces were increasingly using naval vessels to launch attacks on civilians, said Mike Bracken, NATO's military spokesman. Gadhafi was indiscriminately mining waters in Misrata and hampering the flow of humanitarian aid, Bracken said. ""He was using maritime forces to lay mines. These were legal targets,"" Bracken said at a briefing in Brussels, Belgium. He did not say whether crew members were aboard when the ships were hit. The NATO campaign is progressing and Gadhafi's combat power had been severely curtailed, Bracken said. But the Libyan leader's forces continued their heavy shelling of Dehiba, on the Tunisian border, where thousands of refugees have amassed in recent weeks. The border crossing, through which humanitarian aid is often trucked in, was closed Friday. Along the southern borders, rebels had gained control of border crossings between Libya and Sudan and Libya and Chad and had regained control of Kufra in the southeast, according to a report by the International Medical Corps, which has teams in Libya and Tunisia. The global medical organization said rebel control along the Chad border was significant because supplies flow through there to Gadhafi's forces. ""While control of the entire border will be difficult, the rebels are reported to have a large force in the region,"" it said. ""The Niger and Morocco border crossings remain under Gadhafi control."" Meanwhile, the African Union announced it will hold a two-day meeting of heads of state in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa next week to address the conflict in Libya, as well as other security issues in Africa. In another development, the family of South African freelance photojournalist Anton Hammerl, who has been missing in Libya since April, said late Thursday they believe he was killed by Libyan government forces. The statement was posted on the ""Free photographer Anton Hammerl"" Facebook page and followed interviews given in The New York Times, Global Post and The Atlantic by two journalists who said they were with him when he was shot. ""On 5 April 2011, Anton was shot by Gaddafi's forces in an extremely remote location in the Libyan desert. According to eyewitnesses, his injuries were such that he could not have survived without medical attention,"" according to the Facebook statement. Hammerl was last reportedly seen in a remote region of the Libyan desert. He was reportedly captured by Gadhafi's forces near the town of al-Brega, a key oil town in eastern Libya, that has been the site of intense fighting.","NEW: The attack on Zintan began at dawn Thursday and continued through Friday .

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- Sudan and Southern Sudan have signed an agreement on border security amid tensions over the disputed Abyei border region, the African Union said Tuesday. The deal, negotiated Monday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, is designed to ""ensure that the two parties can maintain stable and secure relations,"" the African Union said in a statement.  ""The agreement also establishes a Common Border Zone between North and South Sudan, which is to be demilitarized and jointly monitored and patrolled."" The deal was brokered by the African Union and signed by top military and political officials. Additional negotiations will be held within a week, the statement said. In the wake of January's lopsided vote for independence by residents of Southern Sudan, the autonomous region has been scheduled to become an independent state in early July. But Ezekiel Gatkuoth, the representative of Southern Sudan to the United States, said war could break out between the two sides if the international community does not demand that Sudan withdraw its forces from Abyei so residents who have fled can return. ""People are dying daily. They have no food. They have no shelter,"" he said. ""We are asking the world to respond to this catastrophe."" The World Food Programme said rains made roads impassable in areas south of Abyei, where refugees went, temporarily disrupting food distribution, which had resumed Tuesday. Rain and impassable roads were also making it harder to find people as they fled into the bush, which has made it tough to get a reliable estimate of the number of the displaced. The Sudan People's Liberation Army has cited 150,000; the United Nations has cited 30,000 to 40,000. Last week, the president of the Southern Sudanese government demanded an immediate withdrawal of the Sudanese armed forces that occupy Abyei. And on Monday, the government of Sudan requested that the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) leave the country by July 9, the date set for South Sudan's independence. ""The Sudanese foreign minister has sent a letter to Ban Ki-moon that UNMIS' mandate in Sudan comes to an end at the end of the transitional period, on July 9,"" said Khalid Musa, spokesman for the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, referring to the U.N. secretary-general. Asked whether tensions in Abyei could lead to an extension of UNMIS' mandate in Sudan, Musa said: ""The government is open to dialogue as realities unfold on the ground, but UNMIS' mandate ends on July 9."" UNMIS spokesman Koudeir Zerrouk confirmed the request. ""The government has informed us of its request and a letter was sent to the U.N. secretary-general,"" he told CNN. UNMIS was established following passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1590 to help facilitate peace-building and humanitarian efforts in Sudan shortly after the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Fighting began May 19, when the north accused Southern Sudanese forces of ambushing a U.N. convoy carrying northern troops to Goli, killing at least 22 soldiers. In retaliation, Sudanese troops attacked and took control of Abyei, a move condemned by the United States as a breach of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ended the county's decadeslong civil war between the predominantly Arab and Muslim north and predominantly black animist and Christian south. The conflict led to the deaths of two million people, many from starvation. The U.N. compound in Abyei was shelled by mortar rounds and two peacekeepers were wounded, according to a statement from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's press office. The Sudanese armed forces said the military in Southern Sudan was behind the May 19 attack, but the Sudan People's Liberation Army denied responsibility. Also Monday, the Sudanese government disputed claims by actor George Clooney's Satellite Sentinel Project that government forces were involved in ethnic cleansing by destroying Banton Bridge -- a key link with Southern Sudan.  Pictures posted by the organization show the demolished bridge sitting in a river bed. The government challenged Clooney to prove his allegations. ""I do not think that he has any evidence for ethnic cleansing,"" said Ibrahim Ghandour, minister of information for the ruling National Congress Party. The Satellite Sentinel Project and the Enough Project accuse the government of having greater ambitions. ""Along with the military occupation of Abyei, the Khartoum regime is laying the groundwork for a takeover of oil fields near Sudan's north-south border, its ultimate objective,"" said Enough Project co-founder John Prendergast. ""If there are no consequences for these violations of the north-south peace deal and for the war crimes being committed in Abyei, the likelihood of full-scale war increases daily."" The Satellite Sentinel Project uses satellite imagery to monitor developments in Sudan. CNN's Jenifer Fenton and journalists Jane Ferguson and Isma'il Kushkush contributed to this report.","NEW: Sudanese government asks United Nations to leave by July 9 .

"(CNN) -- Jason Terry can keep the tattoo. One of the many story lines in the NBA Finals won by the Dallas Mavericks Sunday night was Terry's bold tattoo. Terry said he had the Larry O'Brien championship trophy tattooed on his right bicep before the season began because he was confident the Mavs would clinch the title. Losing would've been painful for Terry, literally, as he said he would have the tattoo removed. The Mavs won 105-95, with Terry leading the team with 27 points. It was the Mavs' first NBA championship in franchise history. Dallas clinched the series by a margin of 4-2. Prior to their Game 6 victory, no player on the Mavs had won an NBA title. ""When you did something as crazy as I did, you have to back it up,"" Terry said showing his tattoo to the television cameras.  ""This team never gave up when faced with adversity.  We never gave up. Tonight we got vindication."" The Mavs used furious scoring barrages by Terry and weathered an uneven game by star forward Dirk Nowitzki to win.  In the end, Miami could not overcome Dallas' zone defense. ""I still really can't believe it. The team worked so long and so hard.  The team deserves this. The Mavs nation deserves this,"" Nowitski said. ""I could not get in a rhythm today but the team carried me to this win."" ""I gotta give it up for the fellas,"" Nowitski said. Despite a poor shooting night, Nowitzki still had 21 points. The Mavs held a slim 53-51 lead at halftime and were able to grow the lead. They led by nine at the end of the third quarter. They pulled away in the fourth quarter, helped by Miami's sloppy play and turnovers. The loss was devastating for Miami, a team that seemed to be put together for a championship. Before the season, the Heat added perennial all-star forward Chris Bosh and superstar forward LeBron James to a team that was headed by talented guard Dwayne Wade. A dejected James shook a few hands before quickly walking off the floor. The rest of the Heat stayed out to shake the hands. ""It hurts, of course. But I am not going to hang my head low,"" James told reporters after the game. The win not only means the first championship for star power forward Nowitzki, it also means his Mavericks avenged their crushing loss against the Heat in the 2006 NBA Finals. That year, Nowitzki and the Mavericks watched a 2-0 series lead in the NBA Finals evaporate at the hands of Wade and the Heat. For 38-year-old Dallas point guard Jason Kidd, Sunday's victory was a long-time coming. ""It's something that you always dream of when you come into the league,"" Kidd said shortly after the victory. ""And it just shows the character of this team... I guess the third time's a charm."" The post-game celebration resulted in at least 14 arrests in downtown Dallas, according to police, including four for disorderly conduct and six for public intoxication.

"(CNN) -- Near Yosemite National Park's beautiful Mist Trail, a young man lost his footing, slipping close to the edge of a waterfall. A female companion frantically grabbed for him, but stumbled. Another hiker followed and the three were swept over the powerful 317-foot Vernal Fall, joining a deadly trend at the park this year. Authorities at Yosemite National Park are still searching for two of the bodies from that deadly July accident. And others are searching for answers to explain the recent rash of deaths at the national park in California. This year, 16 people have died from incidents at Yosemite, rangers say. That is about twice as usual. While five visitors have died this year from natural causes, the others were accidental and often entirely preventable. Rangers say some visitors take part in dangerous practices such as hiking treacherous trails in flip-flops, or climbing over safety rails to get better pictures or swimming in waters that are perilously close to waterfalls. Witnesses said the three hikers who were swept over the waterfall in July had climbed over a safety rail. ""We don't station a ranger in every possible dangerous place that's out there,"" said Kari Cobb, a park ranger. ""People have to come here and realize that Yosemite is nature and it is a very wild place."" Bill Ott, a hiker, says he has seen people swimming in dangerous waters. ""We saw a number of people wading just steps from going into the faster water. It's crazy. Just crazy,"" he said. Visitor Tim Timmerman says he has a plan to keep his family safe. ""We aren't worried because we think if you stay where you're supposed to stay, you're safe and it's exciting,"" Timmerman said. ""It'll be a little scary for them but it's not dangerous if you do what you're supposed to do,""","This year, 16 people have died at Yosemite National Park .

My dad had to carry our dog, Belle, who was too old to take the stairs. Hearing the tornado pass through my house is a memory I keep buried. When most of it was over, we couldn't see much. My dad walked to the bottom of the stairs and looked up into what should have been our home, but it was gone. It was just sky. He cleared a path through the debris so he could stand in what should have been our living room. I'll never forget that image of him, the sky above him illuminated with lighting more raw and powerful than I'd ever seen. The tears that streamed down his face let me know it was so much worse than I had thought. The days that followed were some of the hardest. We made trips back and forth to the house where we stayed. We salvaged what we could and picked apart the rubble that used to be our home. Old toys and school work I hadn't seen in years resurfaced and other things, I'll never see again. The stuff I really wanted, you could never find. The days were a blur -- we took photo albums and furniture from the basement to storage units and helped neighbors and friends anyway and everywhere we could. I was depressed, angry, bitter, frustrated. Why us? Why Joplin? More than anything, I hated that it only took the tornado minutes to tear apart my town, but it would be months before life could be anything close to normal. Impact Your World: How to help tornado victims . All those times I'd heard, ""Life's not fair,"" finally made more sense than it ever had before. Before we found a rental house, we stayed with family friends and then my grandparents. Their homes on the other side of town were fine. The rental is nothing like my old house, but my mom has managed to make it feel home-y. I say ""home-y"" because my home -- the house where I grew up and have memories in every room -- is just an empty lot right now, waiting to be rebuilt. It doesn't look like much now, but I love every inch what used to be there. My dad and I talked about the good and bad things that came from the tornado. The bad were a lot easier to list. In fact, I sat there trying to think of good things for a long time before my dad said, ""For every bad thing the tornado has done, think of a good thing, too. That way you keep a balance. You always have to have a balance."" It's something I'm working on. We'll have a new house. The whole town will be newer and nicer than before. All our friends and family are OK. It was always the kind of community where people helped each other, but now everyone knows it. I'm more excited than usual to start school again. The normality that comes with the school year will be a welcome change from the wild card summer we've been dealt. Our new school is in a mall, and it's a cool space to have your senior year. It's just juniors and seniors, so I won't be with my brother for his freshman year. But I'll have the same schedule I wanted before the tornado, and all the sports and activities are starting like usual. Joplin marching band tries to bring back the music . The Friday before the tornado hit, my chemistry teacher, Mr. Parker, had written on the board: If the world ends Sunday, there will be no school Monday. It was just a joke about end-of-the-world predictions in the news, but our world would kind of end. It stopped spinning in those second the tornado was over us, and then started spinning faster than it had before. I think about the tornado every day, but it gets easier. The anger and resentment have worn off. The tornado ruined a lot of things, but we're still here. Our town is being rebuilt, and our schools are starting on time. Good things are still keeping the balance.","A tornado that hit Joplin, Missouri, in May destroyed parts of town and killed more than 150 .

"(CNN) -- Two videos newly posted on YouTube show what Syrian opposition activists say is the gruesome slaughter of civilians in the besieged city of Daraa who had tried to feed people during a recent uprising. One video shows what appears to be a group of Syrian security forces standing over dead bodies, making jokes and discussing planting weapons on them. The gruesome images include the bloody, mangled bodies of five men in civilian clothes. They lie close together on a rooftop, in pools of blood. A group of men dressed in military uniforms walk around them, talking. ""Show me those weapons,"" one says, ""put them here."" Someone drops what seems to be weaponry onto the torso of one of the bodies. ""These are the weapons the committee will come film,"" a voice says. Throughout the uprising in Syria, the Syrian government has described protesters as ""armed criminals"" and ""terrorists,"" at times saying photos prove that the ""criminals"" were armed when security forces shot them. In the video, the people speaking know they are are being taped, addressing the camera at times. Some of them are smiling or laughing. One jokes about ""eyeliner"" on one of the dead bodies. Deadly clashes at Syrian border . Another video of what appears to be the same scene at a different point in time shows the dead bodies. A young man in military uniform then turns to the camera himself and says, ""These are his criminals."" It is not clear who he is referring to. The gory videos -- in which the bodies are bleeding from different areas -- are labeled online as having been shot April 30. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the videos. Two activists with the Syrian opposition explained the incident. One is Abdullah Abazeed, an activist in Daraa, Syria, where the videos were apparently taken. The other activist, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity, is in the United States and helps Syrian activists post videos online. Abazeed said members of his group, the Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union, negotiated the purchase of the two videos from a member of the security forces for 200 Syrian pounds ($40 U.S.) and put them on YouTube. The incident took place in Daraa, which was under siege by Syrian security forces. Four of the men were working out of a mosque in Daraa, supplying food rations to people, the activists said. Two were the sons of Daraa-Abu Ibrahim, the man who calls for the prayers at the mosque; another two were his nephews, the activists said. Syrian forces marched into the mosque and took the four men, along with a fifth unidentified man, to the roof of a neighboring building, the activists said. The mosque's minaret is visible in the background of the videos. The forces shot the men at point blank range, the activists said. Members of the security forces took videos themselves, the activists said. On April 30, Ibrahim -- whose sons and nephews were just killed -- was forced into making a statement on Syrian state television, the activists said. Syrian state television aired video of Ibrahim making a statement at the time. ""The army came to me and asked me for help so I can move a group of people on the roof of the mosque,"" he said. He added that he was ""surprised to find my son was inside. I told him, 'My son, surrender and leave.' I tried twice, and three times and then took myself and left."" He said he told the army lieutenant what had happened, who then told him to go back again. ""There was a gunfight between the army and the group inside which included my children and my nephews,"" Ibrahim said on state TV. ""The thought that they could get martyrdom and their idea was to get freedom. Freedom is not gotten this way, not by means of killing, never ever by killing."" He added that he ""saw them carrying weapons and killing and shooting at the army."" The opposition activists told CNN that Ibrahim's statement was coerced by Syrian security forces, who threatened the rest of his family. Throughout the uprising, the Syrian government has generally ignored requests for comment from CNN, which has not been granted access into the country and is unable to independently verify the accounts. A call to the Syrian embassy press office Sunday was not immediately returned. CNN's Josh Levs and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","Videos show people in military uniforms discussing putting weapons on dead bodies .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- In an attempt to curb runaway inflation, India's central bank raised its benchmark interest rates for the tenth time in sixteen months on Thursday, despite a slowdown in economic growth. The Reserve Bank of India said in a statement that inflation had reached ""uncomfortable levels"" and increased the repo rate at which it lends to commercial banks by 25 basis points to 7.5 percent. The reverse repo rate at which the central bank pays commercial banks for deposits was raised to 6.5 percent. These measures come as government data this week showed Indian's inflation climbed to a higher-than-expected 9.06 percent in May from a year earlier, driven mainly by an increase in prices of manufactured goods. But the central bank's previous rate hikes have made little difference in the cost of living in India. ""If India is to grow in a fast pace then demand must increase and an approach for controlling demand by hiking interest rates will not exactly increase the growth rate or the development of this economy,"" economic adviser to the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Anjan Roy said. India now has the highest inflation rate of any large Asian economy. Analysts say the government's priority is to tame inflation even if its at the expense of economic growth. Reserve Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said in a statement last month that bringing the current elevated rates down should ""take precedence even at the cost of some growth in the short run."" The government has delayed a decision to hike diesel fuel prices fearing it would further stoke inflation. ""Inflation is a very important factor in India, in fact the fortunes of governments depend on the course of inflation particularly food items, so it is predictable that the RBI will take this course,"" Roy said ""but to be honest inflation in India has proven to be insensitive to interest rate hikes. Inflation is going up and interest rates are going up."" Roy said the Indian government must now take a supply side management approach to curb rising prices. Asia's third largest economy grew 7.8 percent from January to March, the slowest pace in five quarters. Analysts say the slower growth is making it harder for the second-fastest-growing major economy in the world to pull hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.","Reserve Bank of India raises key interest rates .

"(CNN) -- The wife of former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn said she is closing down her popular French blog. Anne Sinclair, who has been writing about life in the United States on her blog, ""Two or Three Things Seen in America"" since 2008, wrote Monday: ""You understand the circumstances which force me to temporarily suspend this blog."" She closed by saying, ""See you soon."" Strauss-Kahn, who is awaiting a trial on sexual assault charges, was released on bail from the Rikers Island jail Friday. He is accused of trying to rape a maid this month in his suite at the Sofitel hotel in New York. He will stay with his wife. Strauss-Kahn faces two counts of criminal sexual act; two counts of sexual abuse; and one count each of attempt to commit rape, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. In the charge of criminal sexual act in the first degree, Strauss-Kahn is accused of having ""engaged in oral sexual conduct with an individual ... by forcible compulsion,"" an indictment states. There appears to be growing popular sympathy for Sinclair, a former television broadcaster described by some as the ""Barbara Walters"" of France. ""She is very courageous,"" said Jack Lang, one of the elders of France's Socialist Party, as well as a friend and neighbor of Strauss-Kahn.

Breitbart, appearing on the ""Opie and Anthony"" show on the Sirius XM radio network, showed the picture on his cell phone during the interview, according to Breitbart and the show's hosts. A television camera recorded the image of the cell phone with the picture on its screen, and that image was then sent out on Twitter by the show host known as Opie, whose real name is Gregg Hughes. According to Breitbart, he got the photo from a woman who communicated with Weiner online. The woman told Breitbart that Weiner sent her the photo. Dems privately urge Weiner to resign . On Monday, Breitbart told reporters he had an ""X-rated"" photo that had been sent to a woman by Weiner. Breitbart said then he wasn't going to release it publicly for now.

Both Breitbart and the ""Opie and Anthony"" hosts said Wednesday that the public release of the photo occurred without Breitbart's knowledge. In a video posted on YouTube explaining what happened, Hughes said a viewer using screen-capture technology sent co-host Anthony Cumia the televised image of Breitbart's phone showing the photo.

"(CNN) -- Famed evangelist Billy Graham, 92, was being treated Wednesday at an Asheville, North Carolina, hospital for pneumonia following an overnight health episode, according to a spokesman. Graham was in good spirits and humor and signed all admission forms, spokesman A. Larry Ross said. Initial pulmonary testing suggested pneumonia, and further tests showed Graham's heart was normal, Mission Hospital said. The minister, who lives in nearby Montreat, North Carolina, was reported to be in stable condition and fully alert. He was receiving antibiotics. No date was set for Graham's release, but Ross said he hopes it will be soon. Graham had episodes of sweating and coughing overnight, according to Ross. The evangelist had a slight fever and difficulty breathing, but was not believed to be in an acute situation. The founder of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association has preached to millions over six decades, and has provided counsel to generations of U.S. presidents, beginning with President Harry S. Truman. Graham's son, Franklin, was on a humanitarian mission in North Korea for Samaritan's Purse, a relief and evangelism organization. Franklin Graham leads the evangelistic association and was not expected to return home because of his father's illness. Daughter Anne Graham Lotz will continue a missionary trip to Israel, Ross said. The pastor expressed appreciation to the medical staff and hospital and had a large lunch because he missed breakfast, Ross said. Billy Graham has been hospitalized or treated for several ailments over the years, including head surgery, a fall, intestinal bleeding, prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease. According to Ross, Graham has remained in good health overall. Age-related conditions -- including macular degeneration and hearing loss -- have kept Graham at home in recent years, but the evangelist is involved in writing projects, including a manuscript for a book about aging, Ross said. Graham's wife, Ruth Bell Graham, died in 2007. CNN's Anna Rhett Miller contributed to this report.","NEW: Billy Graham in good spirits and humor, spokesman says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Department of Defense announced Tuesday that capital charges have been refiled against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other alleged co-conspirators in the September 11, 2001, conspiracy to allow prosecution before a military commission at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, naval base. The move comes after the Obama administration dropped plans to prosecute the suspects in federal court in New York. Besides Mohammed, the other suspects accused of participating in the 9/11 plot are Walid bin Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. All five are at Guantanamo. A Pentagon statement said the charges ""allege that the five accused were responsible for the planning and execution"" of the 9/11 attacks, resulting in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people. Charges against all five accused include conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destruction of property in violation of the law of war, hijacking aircraft and terrorism, the statement said. The filing of capital charges means the defendants could face death sentences if convicted. The final decision about whether the death penalty can be pursued is in the hands of retired Vice Adm. Bruce McDonald. In military terminology he is the convening authority of the military commissions, the equivalent of a civilian criminal court. The last military execution was in 1961, involving a U.S. Army private who had been convicted of rape and attempted murder of an Austrian girl. Mohammed was first charged in May 2008 before a military commission in Guantanamo, but the charges were suspended in early 2009 when the Obama administration took over and sought a fresh review of all detainees at the overseas prison. Later that year, Attorney General Eric Holder announced Mohammed and several other key terror suspects would face prosecution in the military justice system. The Obama administration had considered transferring some terror suspects to the United States for prosecution in either special military or civilian courts. But after widespread opposition across the political platform, the president announced earlier this year all prosecutions would be in military courts in Guantanamo. Obama also had pledged to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility within a year of becoming president. However, it remains open due to legal complexities involving the status of some detainees and congressional opposition to holding trials for high-profile suspects in U.S. criminal courts.

"Tijuana, Mexico (CNN) -- Hidden between tomato stalks, the Mexican army found what officials describe as the largest marijuana plantation in the nation, a top military official announced Thursday. Gen. Alfonso Duarte Mugica said the plantation six hours south of Tijuana is 168 times larger than the soccer field in Mexico City's Azteca Stadium. It spans for 120 hectares (about 300 acres), he said. Tomatoes growing there hid marijuana plants that were up to 2.5 meters (8.2. feet) tall, Duarte said. Authorities detained six people this week during the operation to seize the field, which is located in the area of Ensenada, Baja California. The takeover means drug traffickers will not receive 1.8 billion pesos ($153 million), he said, apparently referring to an estimated sales value of the crop. Duarte said 250 soldiers will destroy the drugs seized within the next week. Since Mexican President Felipe Calderon's administration began in December 2006, officials have destroyed more than 83,251 hectares (206,000 acres) of marijuana, according to a report from the country's defense department. Journalist Jose Israel Ibarra of CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.","The plantation is 168 times the size of the field in Mexico City's soccer stadium .

"(EW.com) -- James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales' followup to their excellent 2002 ""Saturday Night Live"" book, ""Live From New York,"" is an oral history of ESPN, and its contents have been a closely guarded secret (GQ recently posted some of the book's juiciest Olbermann sections). Until today, that is. Publisher Little, Brown just lifted their embargo, meaning that we can now reveal some details of the much-anticipated project. So what's the big secret? The book is enormous -- 700-plus pages of interviews with big names like Keith Olbermann, Chris Berman, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Eisner, Erin Andrews, and many, many more. The authors talked to more than 550 people and cover an amazing amount of ground. It's a serious, impressive piece of work, if a little too long and padded out with less-interesting material. The book offers a nuanced look at ESPN, does some top-notch TV-biz reporting on the early days of the cable industry, and offers compelling behind-the-scenes stories about a number of big events (ESPN's botched takeover of Monday Night Football, the creation of the X Games, the Rush Limbaugh-Donovan McNabb blowup). But what everyone will probably want to talk about, at least for now, is the dirt. And there's a bunch of it: the book is packed with huge egos and bad behavior. Here are just a few highlights: . -- ""The company would have Christmas parties up at some horrible place in Bristol [Connecticut, where ESPN is based],"" says former general counsel Andy Brilliant. ""A couple of them were drunken orgies.... It became like a big frat party. There were a lot of drugs being done in the bathroom. There was quite a bit of screwing going on afterward, a lot of it extramarital. But everybody went back to business the next workday."" -- ""There was screwing in the hallways,"" says onetime reporter Sal Marchiano of ESPN's early days. ""Okay, maybe not in the hallways, but there were a couple of stairwell stories.... There were drugs in the building, that I knew. There was one guy who dealt pot."" -- At one point in the '80s ESPN kept an apartment in New York City. ""I remember [an ESPN exec] coming in and saying, 'We gotta get rid of this apartment...because the mail boys got a couple of our secretaries hooking over there,'"" says former ESPN CEO Bill Grimes. ""Hooking! That's what he said.... 'They're making money after work when no one's there. It's getting out of control.'"" -- Sexual harassment was an ongoing issue. In the late '80s the problem got so bad that anchor Karie Ross actually stood up in front of 200 or so people in the cafeteria and demanded that it stop. Her plea didn't have much impact. ""No fewer than fifty cases of sexual harassment were reported by women on the staff to ESPN management in the first half of the 1990s,"" the authors write. -- Keith Olbermann is hardly the network's only cranky anchor. ""I was introduced to [Chris Berman], and my title was mentioned,"" recalls marketing senior VP Lee Ann Daly. ""He was like, 'Oh, goddammit, do we need another vice president?' And I just said, 'Nice to meet you, too, Mr. Berman.' ....there was really no need to be a jerk. But that kind of stuck with me. I noticed that Chris Berman was rarely happy. He was always very difficult to please."" -- The biggest villain in the book? Quite possibly the town of Bristol, Connecticut, which is apparently so isolated and dull that it drives ESPN execs who work there to all sorts of boorish behavior. ""I think part of the sexual harassment stuff was location,"" says former ESPN chairman Steve Bornstein. ""It's one hundred miles from real civilization, and you got the kind of testosterone, jock mentality, frat house approach that's pretty much a recipe for stupid decisions being made."" Or as another exec, Bill Creasy, puts it, ""What a s---hole. I mean, what were they thinking [locating ESPN HQ there]?""

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has split from the management company which has helped him become one of the world's wealthiest sportsmen since he joined it at the start of his professional golf career back in 1996. The former top-ranked player announced on Monday that he will be staying with his longtime agent Mark Steinberg, who has left IMG after his contract expired. ""Staying with Mark Steinberg. Total confidence in him,"" Woods wrote on social networking website Twitter. ""Excited about the next stage in my professional life. Fond memories of Mark McCormack."" McCormack founded IMG, one of the world's leading sports management companies, but died in 2003. Sliding Tiger drops out of golf's top ten . Woods' endorsements have been handled by Steinberg since 1998, but the golfer's declining fortunes have reportedly led to his agent's departure from IMG. Woods has not won a tournament since the end of 2009, and the scandal about his marital infidelities that broke after that resulted in the loss of some lucrative sponsorship deals. The 35-year-old has dropped to 15th in the rankings, struggling this year with injuries, but he still earned $70 million in 2010 from his existing deals according to Golf Digest. Harmon expresses fears for Woods' career . Sports Business Journal and the New York Times both reported that Woods' reduced earnings meant that IMG could no longer afford Steinberg's salary. IMG has instead promoted Guy Kinnings and Robbie Henchman, its senior vice-presidents in Europe and Asia Pacific respectively, to be co-heads of its golf division. Woods is battling to be fit for this month's U.S. Open, a major tournament he has won three times, due to ongoing leg problems he suffered at the Masters in April. He had to pull out of last month's Players Championship after only nine holes when he aggravated his injuries -- his only on-course action since finishing fourth at Augusta. Meanwhile, Steve Stricker won his 10th PGA Tour title on Sunday as he finished a shot clear at the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio. The 44-year-old triumphed for the first time this season as he saved par from bunkers at 16 and 17 then bogeyed the last hole to head off fellow Americans Brandt Jobe and Matt Kuchar, who finished strongly with seven-under-par 65s. It was his first top-10 finish in 11 visits to the event at Muirfield, hosted by golf legend Jack Nicklaus, as he held his nerve despite a two-hour weather delay. Former world No. 1 Vijay Singh, who tied for 37th as he also closed with 65, may miss the June 16-19 U.S. Open at Congressional after the veteran Fijian failed to show at a qualifying event. The 48-year-old, a three-time major champion, has played the past 67 of golf's four main tournaments.","American golfer Tiger Woods decides to stay with his agent Mark Steinberg .

"(CNN) -- Ongoing sectarian violence has left 52 people dead in a southern Pakistani city in the last few days, police said Thursday. Unknown gunmen opened fire Thursday evening on two buses in the city of Karachi, killing 10 people and wounding 20, said Muhammad Aslam, a Karachi police official. In a separate incident Thursday evening in Karachi's Orangi Town neighborhood, three people were killed by shooting on a residential colony, Aslam said. Another 11 people were killed Thursday, 18 on Wednesday and 10 on Tuesday, during clashes in several neighborhoods in Karachi, said Arslan Umar, a police official in the city. The clashes have been blamed on a bitter rivalry between the political parties of Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and the Awami National Party (ANP). The MQM mostly represents Urdu-speaking people, who migrated to Pakistan from India during partition in 1947, while the Awami National Party, represents Pashto speakers -- more of whom are moving to Karachi from northwest Pakistan in search of jobs.

"London (CNN) -- Media baron Rupert Murdoch broke his silence on a scandal swirling around his flagship British tabloid newspaper Wednesday, calling allegations that journalists illegally hacked into the voice mails of murder and terrorism victims ""deplorable and unacceptable."" The head of News Corp. issued the statement after the father of a bombing victim said his phone may have been hacked. allegations that Prime Minister David Cameron called ""absolutely disgusting."" Graham Foulkes, whose son was killed in a 2005 London terrorist attack, said Wednesday his phone number and home address were found in the files of a private investigator working for the News of the World, a Sunday tabloid. The accusation came after allegations that journalists also hacked into the phone messages of missing teenager Milly Dowler, who was later found to have been murdered. Police launched a special investigation this year into accusations that News of the World engaged in widespread phone hacking targeting politicians and celebrities. Actor Hugh Grant told CNN Wednesday that police had visited him as part of their investigation. Hugh Grant on UK tabloid scandal: 'Vote with your wallets' Now, following allegations this week that the paper also illegally eavesdropped on murder victims and the families of people killed in terrorist bombings, Cameron said an independent inquiry was needed. ""We are no longer talking about politicians and celebrities but murder victims, potentially terrorist victims. It's absolutely disgusting what has taken place,"" Cameron said in the House of Commons. ""I think everyone in this house and country will be revolted by what they've heard and seen on their TV screens."" But Cameron said the inquiry could not begin until after the police investigation was done, for fear of interfering with it. News Corp. subsidiary News International, which owns News of the World, said it welcomed ""calls for a broad public inquiry into standards and practices in the industry."" Hacking scandal exposes secrets at Murdoch's tabloid . The list of possible victims widened further Wednesday, when the British Press Association reported that relatives of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan may have been victims of the hacking scheme. ""The Ministry of Defence was seeking clarification from Scotland Yard as sources said families of dead servicemen were being contacted by detectives over the scandal,"" the report said. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense told CNN: ""This is a matter for the Metropolitan Police who are investigating these allegations. It would be inappropriate for us to comment whilst this investigation is ongoing."" The British Press Association said News International had told it that it would be ""absolutely appalled and horrified"" if the allegations proved true. A News International spokesman told the association: ""News International's record as a friend of the armed services and of our servicemen and servicewomen, is impeccable."" Separately, London's Metropolitan Police said Wednesday they were opening an investigation into the possible bribery of police officers by people working for the News International media group. Papers given to the Metropolitan Police by News International lawyers ""include information relating to alleged inappropriate payments to a small number of... officers,"" Commissioner Paul Stephenson said in a statement Wednesday. News International confirmed it had given police paperwork related to the possible bribery, calling the handover evidence of its ""determination as a company to deal responsibly and correctly with the issues."" The company also said Wednesday it was ""shocked and appalled at any serious allegations with regards to victims of crime."" ""Our company must fully and proactively cooperate with the police in all investigations, and that is exactly what News International has been doing and will continue to do under (CEO) Rebekah Brooks' leadership,"" Murdoch said in his separate statement. A senior police officer involved in the phone hacking investigation called Graham Foulkes Tuesday to say his details were in the files of a private investigator working for the News of the World, the victim's father said Wednesday. Foulkes' son David was among the 52 people killed on July 7, 2005, when suicide bombers struck three London Underground trains and a bus. Foulkes said police did not tell him whether his phone had been hacked, but the possibility horrified him, he said. London's Metropolitan Police refused to comment Wednesday. ""We'd obviously been having very intimate and detailed personal conversations, so to think now that these people may have been listening in to that at such an important time, such a dark and difficult time, is quite unbelievable,"" Foulkes said. He and his wife had just been talking about ""how horrendous it must have been"" for the Dowler family ""to be told that someone had been listening in to them,"" when he learned that he, too, might have been a victim of hacking, he told CNN affiliate ITV. If the allegations of hacking are true, he said, the perpetrators ""need to be punished, and punished severely."" He called on News International to be truthful and honest about what happened and ""put their hands up and say, 'We're sorry.'"" Labour Party leader Ed Miliband said Brooks should resign in the face of what he called ""the biggest press scandal in modern times."" Cameron refused to back Miliband's call, saying it would be fairer to let the investigation run its course. Murdoch's statement suggests he is standing by Brooks. Phone hacking involves calling a phone from two other phones at the same time, sending one caller to voice mail. That caller then enters the code number to retrieve voice mail remotely. Hackers depend on the fact that many people never change the default PIN for voice mail retrieval. Initial complaints about hacking came from politicians and celebrities, but the story took a new turn Tuesday with the accusation that the paper hacked into the voice mails of the murdered girl. ""The family are completely horrified. They thought this was all over"" after the disappearance of Milly Dowler in 2002 and the conviction of a man for her murder this year, Dowler family lawyer Mark Lewis said Tuesday. But in April, police told the Dowlers that journalists had hacked into their phones and those of their daughter, he said. Journalists deleted some of Milly Dowler's messages to make space for more, thus giving her parents hope she was still alive when she was dead, Lewis said. The paper has apologized for hacking into the voice mails of celebrities and politicians, paying compensation to actress Sienna Miller and offering money to others. But the Dowler case marks the first time the newspaper is accused of interfering with a police investigation. Police have declined to say whether Milly Dowler was among the victims of phone hacking. Brooks told staff Tuesday that it was ""almost too horrific to believe that a professional journalist or even a freelance inquiry agent working on behalf of a member of the News of the World staff could behave in this way."" Brooks, who was editor of the paper at the time of the alleged Dowler hacking, told staff she was ""sickened that these events are alleged to have happened."" CNN obtained a copy of the e-mail Brooks sent to staff on Tuesday. News International confirmed it was genuine. Brooks acknowledges in the message that there is speculation she might resign, but said she was ""determined to lead the company to ensure we do the right thing and resolve these serious issues."" At least five people have been arrested in connection with phone hacking investigations this year since a new investigation, Operation Weeting, was launched in January. Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and a journalist working for the News of the World were sent to prison in 2007 for hacking into the voice mails of royal staff in an earlier investigation. Police launched the new investigation this year in response to widespread complaints from politicians, celebrities and other high-profile figures who fear they may have been targets. News International has apologized for unspecified cases of hacking. They say they have been cooperating with police since the new investigation was launched in January. The tabloid in April offered compensation and ""apologized unreservedly"" for the ""unacceptable"" acts. It did not name the victims. In addition to owning News of the World, News International owns the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times in Britain. Murdoch's News Corp. also encompasses Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers. CNN's Carol Jordan, Antonia Mortensen, Jonathan Wald, Dan Rivers, J.P.

"(CNN) -- One of the worst wildfires in Arizona history grew by 40,000 acres Monday, forcing the evacuation of thousands as crews battled heavy winds in trying to prevent the 30-mile line from advancing further, officials said. The ""Wallow Fire,"" as the blaze is known, has scorched 233,522 acres as of Monday evening -- up more than 21% from the 192,746 acres reported that morning -- said Terri Wildermuth, a spokeswoman for the Incident Management Team that is overseeing firefighting efforts. ""We had a hard day today,"" Joe Reinarz, an incident commander, told those attending a town hall meeting in Greer, Arizona, on Monday evening. ""I don't know exactly where that fire is at this moment, because it is moving so fast."" The eastern Arizona wildfire, which began May 29, has forced the closure of the Apache National Forest and prompted the evacuation of about 3,000 people, said Mark Weldon of the Arizona Red Cross. Some 2,000 of those are in Alpine, about 700 are in Greer, 200 to 300 are in Nutrioso, and fewer than 100 are in Sunrise. The National Weather Service instituted a ""red flag warning,"" which means weather conditions are ripe for wildfires, for much of the northern half of the state. In eastern Arizona, southwest winds blew 25 to 28 mph through the region Monday with nighttime gusts forecast to blow as strong as 40 mph. Wind speeds are expected to slow somewhat but still be strong in the coming days, the weather service said, with daytime temperatures in the most affected regions forecast in the mid-60s. ""Tomorrow, (the wind) is supposed to pick back up all through Thursday,"" said Reinarz. ""We've got two or three days ahead ... that will try all of us."" The U.S. Forest Service said the fire is the fourth largest in Arizona's history, but Brad Pitassi of the incident management team said it is the third largest. While there have been no significant injuries so far, officials and area residents complained of heavy smoke that has blanketed the area like fog. ""To me, it feels like I'm suffocating,"" Deanna Davis told CNN affiliate KTVK. ""Smoke just sits in this valley and it sucks the air right out of you."" Davis, who manages Davis True Value Hardware store in Springerville, Arizona, said the fire and resulting smoke had forced a run on her store from customers looking to buy face masks. Among the evacuees was Jessie Walker, who along with his wife, Holly, abandoned the house he built in Nutrioso with his own hands to escape the approaching fire, according to Phoenix-based CNN affiliate KNXV. ""What a person don't realize is is how hard it is to face something like that,"" Walker told KNXV. ""You think you're prepared for it, you think you're mentally prepared for it, physically prepared for it. You're not. ""It's hard,"" Walker said, fighting back tears. The Walkers took as many of their possessions as they could even though there wasn't enough time to pack. Those belongings are now stored in a trailer out of harm's way. Walker said he has a brother who stayed behind. ""He wants to fight for what's his and I don't blame him,"" Walker said. The fire has bedeviled fire crews with its unpredictable path, thanks to wind gusts that have carried burning embers up to three miles.  Apache County Deputy Chief Sheriff Brannon Eagar on Monday evening urged people in the area, even if they haven't been ordered to evacuate yet, to get ready to leave. ""They can't predict how fast it's going to go,"" Eagar said at the town hall event in Greer. ""So make sure, please, you get ready. ""If I can convince anybody, please go. It'll make your life so much easier,"" he added. ""This thing is huge."" CNN's Ben Smith, Chelsea J.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Explosions at three government facilities in eastern China Thursday left two people dead, including the alleged perpetrator, the country's state-run Xinhua news agency reported. At least six people were injured in the blasts, which occured within a half hour of each other, local officials told CNN. ""A car bomb went off at 9:18 a.m. in the parking lot of the Fuzhou city prosecutor's office, followed by a blast at 9:20 a.m. at the Linchuan district government building and another car bomb at 9:45 a.m. near the local drug administration building,"" said Zhang Baoyun, a spokesman for the government of Jiangxi province, where Fuzhou is located. One body was found in the district government building and another person died in the hospital, Zhang added. Xinhua, citing police sources, reported that one of the people who died in the blast was the man suspected of setting off the explosives.  The man was identified as Qian Mingqi, 52, an unemployed resident of the area. Earlier, Xinhua said a disgruntled local peasant farmer had set off the bombs because of an ongoing lawsuit. On the Weibo page allegedly belonging to Qian, the bio line reads: ""I am physically and mentally normal, and have no criminal record or history of illegal petitions. When my new house was illegally torn down, it caused me huge financial loss. After a futile ten years of appealing for justice, I am forced to take a path I don't want to."" Weibo, the country's most popular microblogging service, is the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. Photos from the scene show large crowds gathering near one of the blast sites with a thick plume of black smoke in the air. State-run Xinhua news agency quoted eyewitnesses as saying glass windows were shattered at the eight-story prosecutor's office building, while ambulances rushed in and out of the district government compound. Authorities are still investigating the explosions, while the injured -- including three in serious condition -- are at local hospitals, Zhang said. Fuzhou is a city of nearly 4 million residents some 1,600 kilometers (975 miles) south of Beijing. Last September, clashes between residents and officials in Yihuang, a county in Fuzhou, gained national attention. Three residents doused themselves with gasoline and burned themselves to protest the forced demolition of their homes by the local government. One died in the hospital, prompting widespread outrage that eventually forced provincial authorities to sack several local officials.

"(CNN) -- Japan's cabinet on Friday approved a $49 billion budget to help in the reconstruction of areas decimated by last month's earthquake and tsunami. The Disaster Relief Fund will pay for removal of rubble and debris, temporary housing, rebuilding of roads, farms, airports and schools, and loans to small- and medium-sized businesses. Seeking to turn the nation's focus to the arduous task of rebuilding, Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan last week invoked the imagery of his country's recovery from World War II. ""We must renew the determination that we had in the post-World War II reconstruction period, and we must tackle the task of reconstruction after this earthquake,"" he said. The devastation left behind by the March 11 earthquake is an opportunity to build ""a new, better future than before,"" said the prime minister, who was born in 1946 -- a year after the end of the war. Kan said the Japanese people ""stood up bravely and achieved a reconstruction that amazed the world."" The fund is only expected to cover a fraction of the total cost of recovery. The double disaster could cost Japan's government in excess of $305 billion, Deputy Finance Minister Mitsuru Sakurai told reporters last month. The monster 9.0-magnitude quake that rocked the country also spawned a tsunami, leaving nearly 28,000 people dead or missing.

"Dadaab, Kenya (CNN) -- When I was in the third grade, a classmate of mine died of leukemia. None of us knew he was sick, only that his mother hadn't let him attend school in a while. More than 30 years later, I still remember the awful day my mom told me my friend had passed away. I made a card for his mother, and walked to their house to deliver it. She was too overcome to take any visitors, but thanked me and took the card. I can recall her broken up face when she shut the door. Over time we lost touch, but during the holidays a couple of years ago, I stopped by her home to pay a visit. She recognized me right away, smiled and invited me in for a cup of coffee. And then, while hanging my jacket, she began to tremble and cry. So many years later, the sorrow was just under the surface. The experience left an indelible impression on me, one that I better understood after becoming a parent myself. It violates a natural order of life to bury your own child, and I am not sure the grief ever goes away. Impact Your World: How you can help . That's the position 30,000 Somali parents found themselves in this summer. And, 600,000 more children may be buried before the end of the year. In just about any other place on Earth, those numbers would scream out from international headlines, but not here in East Africa. Inside the Dadaab Refugee Camp, a mass burial site sits within walking distance of the close cluster of tents. Amin Hassan took me to see the tiny burial site of her 1-month old daughter, Addison. It was nearly lost among all the other shallow, hastily dug graves. Small sticks mark these raised plots of dirt with nothing else except bits of colored plastic trash stuck in the ground and blowing in the wind. There are no nameplates, no flowers and no reminders of their lives. People here just vanish. Misery in world's largest refugee camp . ""She was perfectly healthy when she arrived,"" Amin told me. They had left Somalia in search of food and water, and felt relief when they finally reached the camp. It may have been contaminated water that caused little Addison's intractable diarrhea and vomiting or an overwhelming infection. Pertussis or whooping cough is something they see quite often here. ""And measles,"" one of the doctors told me. Many of these infections are wildly contagious, especially among the hundreds of thousands of unvaccinated kids in these camps. Saving Ahmed from starvation . As I stood and spoke to Hassan, with all those tiny burial sites around us, I couldn't help but think of my friend and his mother.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Doctors have given a woman a new windpipe with tissue engineered from her own stem cells in what experts have hailed as a ""milestone in medicine."" Claudia Castillo, 30, suffered from tuberculosis for years. The breakthrough allowed Claudia Castillo, 30, to receive a new section of trachea -- an airway essential for breathing -- without the risk that her body would reject the transplant. Castillo was given the stem cell surgery, the controversial branch of medicine that some say could lead to human cloning, after suffering a severe lung collapse. The condition, caused by long-term tuberculosis left Castillo, a Colombian now living in Barcelona, unable to carry out simple domestic duties or care for her two children. The only conventional option was a major operation to remove her left lung, a risky procedure with a high mortality rate. Sound off: What do you think about this medical breakthrough? A team from the universities of Barcelona, Spain; Bristol, England; and Padua and Milan, Italy, decided instead to replace Castillo's lower trachea and bronchial tube to her left lung with a lab-grown airway. The operation, reported Wednesday in the British medical journal The Lancet, has been hailed as a major leap for medicine that could offer new hope for patients suffering from serious illness. ""Surgeons can now start to see and understand the very real potential for adult stem cells and tissue engineering to radically improve their ability to treat patients with serious diseases,"" said Martin Birchall, professor of surgery at the University of Bristol, who was part of the team that did the operation. ""We believe this success has proved that we are on the verge of a new age in surgical care."" To create the new windpipe, the team took a seven-centimeter (2.75-inch) segment of trachea from a 51-year-old who had died. Over a six-week period, the team then removed all the cells from the donor trachea, because those cells could lead to rejection of the organ after transplant. All that remained of the donor's stripped-down trachea was a matrix of collagen, a sort of scaffolding onto which the team then put Castillo's own stem cells -- along with cells taken from a healthy part of her trachea. Birchall had already taken Castillo's stem cells from her bone marrow and grown them into a large population in his Bristol lab.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain the procedure » . Four days after putting Castillo's stem cells into the donor trachea, the team was able to perform the transplant operation at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona. Castillo had no complications from the operation and was discharged from the hospital 10 days later. ""We are terribly excited by these results,"" said Paolo Macchiarini of the University of Barcelona, who performed the operation in June.  Watch Macchiarini describe the operation » . Macchiarini said just four days after the operation, the transplanted windpipe was ""almost indistinguishable"" from the patient's normal bronchi. After one month, he said, the blood vessels had successfully grown back. ""We think that this first experience represents a milestone in medicine and hope that it will unlock the door for a safe and recipient-tailored transplantation of the airway in adults and children,"" the authors said in their report. ""We hope that these future patients will no longer suffer the trauma of speech loss, severe shortness of breath and other limited clinical and social activities."" The doctors said Castillo is now able to care for her children and enjoy a normal quality of life. She can walk up two flights of stairs and occasionally even go out dancing at night. In a comment accompanying the Lancet report, Toshihiko Sato and Tatsuo Nakamura of Kyoto University in Japan said the operation should be highly regarded, but follow-ups from longer evaluation periods are needed to better evaluate the results.","Only a few windpipe, or trachea, transplants have ever been done.

"(CNN) -- Sunday has long been a day for reflection in Joplin, Missouri, with residents flocking to churches and other places of worship for guidance, understanding and a sense of community. Now, several of those churches are gone, as are scores who might otherwise be going to them, thanks to a horrific tornado that ripped through the southwest Missouri city one week ago. That makes this Sunday especially significant, not to mention the subsequent days, as religious leaders try to offer meaning after such a senseless disaster. ""You could see ... the challenge they are going to face, as they preach funerals in the weeks to come,"" Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said after meeting faith-based leaders this week. ""It's enormous."" Nixon, along with President Barack Obama, will be among those attending a special memorial service at Missouri Southern State University for the 142 killed (as of Saturday evening) and thousands more affected by the tornado. Obama to view Joplin tornado damage . Then at 5:41 p.m. -- exactly one week after an EF-5 tornado, with winds over 200 mph, first touched down -- the city will go silent. That moment will be a stark contrast to the fury the Rev. Justin Monaghan experienced as the twister barrelled toward St. Mary's Catholic Church. The 70-year-old pastor got in a bathtub at the church, put his face down and prayed. When the winds ceased, Monaghan found himself trapped in the rubble -- where he remained until some of his parishioners rescued him, unscathed. While he's still coming to grips with what happened, Monaghan said he believes that good will come out of this tragedy and in fact already has. ""God allows things to happen that we don't know why,"" the pastor said earlier this week. ""But when we look back, we always hear the good things that happen as a result."" That positive energy was on display Saturday on the church grounds. There, parishioners and volunteers picked through the debris looking for items to salvage, Monaghan said. One found the pastor's Bible, and another was able to save his golf clubs. Two tornado-wracked towns unite through tragedy, charity . ""The enthusiasm was unbelievable, even as people were shedding tears,"" Monaghan said. ""It's just wonderful to see."" On Sunday, Monaghan said he will celebrate Mass at St. Peter's, another Catholic church in Joplin. And if and when his church is rebuilt -- something that he expects will happen, with the parish council's support -- the pastor said a 6-foot cross that somehow braved the storm will be a part of it, behind the altar. ""We wouldn't dream of not using that,"" he said. The Bridge Ministries, a nondenominational Christian youth organization, has opened its doors to schools, relief agencies and churches in need of space. They include members of St. Paul's United Methodist Church, which will hold their Sunday services at the ministries' center after their own facility was severely damaged in the storm. Dan Mitchell, the organization's president, said he has been impressed that so many people, from near and far, offered help. Food, water and clothing have come in everything from car trunks to tractor-trailers, he said, and the center's parking lot has transformed into a distribution point for supplies. Meanwhile, Mitchell said that locals directly affected have seen their faith strengthened in the past week. ""Faithful Christians who understand that God creates order from chaos have stood up and done what it takes,"" he said. ""They have given up their lives. If they come up against roadblocks, they get around them and they get it done.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The perjury trial of ex-baseball all-star Roger Clemens ended in a mistrial Thursday after jurors heard statements in a prosecution video that the judge had ruled inadmissible until later in the case. U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said prosecutors should have modified a video that showed a congressman talking about a deposition from the wife of Clemens' old teammate, former New York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte, during a 2008 congressional hearing. Walton had decided earlier that prosecutors couldn't include references to Laura Pettitte's testimony unless it was brought up on rebuttal. ""I can't in good faith leave this case in a situation where a man's liberty is at risk when the government should have taken steps to ensure that we were not in this situation,'' Walton said after Clemens' lawyers asked for a mistrial. ""I don't see how I can unring the bell.'' The decision came on the second day of testimony in the trial. Walton set a September 2 hearing on whether to retry the case. Clemens left the courthouse without comment after the ruling, telling reporters, ""I'd appreciate it if y'all would let me walk home now."" Clemens, nicknamed ""Rocket,"" is accused of perjury, obstruction of Congress and making false statements about his alleged use of steroids and human growth hormone. During an appearance before a House committee in 2008, he testified that he never used illegal performance-enhancing substances during his career -- a statement prosecutors say is contradicted by witnesses and physical evidence. He faced a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a $1.5 million fine on the counts against him. Clemens was one of the most feared pitchers in all of baseball during 24 seasons playing for the Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, Houston Astros and New York Yankees. He retired in 2007 with 4,672 strikeouts, seven Cy Young awards and two World Series titles. But that December, he was among the players named in an investigative report by former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell on the use of performance-enhancing drugs. The following February, he told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that steroid use was ""totally incompatible with who I am and what I stand for."" ""I cannot in good conscience admit to doing something that I did not do, even if it would be easier to do so,"" he told the committee under oath. But in Wednesday's opening statements, Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Durham said prosecutors have needles and used cotton swabs that hold the former player's DNA, as well as residue from anabolic steroids. Those items came from Brian McNamee, a former strength and conditioning coach who claims to have injected Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone. Prosecutors said McNamee held on to the physical evidence for one simple reason: ""He never completely trusted this man,"" Durham said. But Clemens' lawyer, Rusty Hardin, told jurors McNamee has no credibility. ""Brian McNamee is a liar. He was a liar before this started. He's still lying to the government,"" Hardin said.","NEW: ""I'd appreciate it if y'all would let me walk home now,"" Clemens tells reporters .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich have confirmed that Turkish international Hamit Altintop is one of three players who will leave the club after Saturday's final Bundesliga match of the season against Stuttgart. Former Schalke midfielder Altintop, defensive midfielder Andreas Ottl and reserve goalkeeper Thomas Kraft are the trio who will be moving on during the close season, with the club marking their farewell with a bouquet of flowers after the game. Altintop, 28, joined Bayern in 2007 and was a member of the domestic double winning sides of 2008 and 2010, also featuring in the 2010 Champions League final defeat by Inter Milan. However, his time at the club was restricted by injuries, restricting him to just 63 Bundesliga appearances in four seasons. ""This season, Hamit only played three games from the start. He feels that's not enough, and we understand and respect his decision,"" Bayern chairman Karl- Heinz Rummenigge told the club's official website. It is unclear where Altintop will play his football next season, although there have been reports linking Real Madrid with a move for the player. Meanwhile, Ottl leaves Bayern after joining the club in 1996 aged just 11. The 26-year-old never fully established himself in the senior side, making 91 appearances and scoring five goals during his time with the Bavarian giants. A valuable squad member, Ottl has won three Bundesliga titles and three German Cups during his time with Bayern. Meanwhile, Kraft has decided to leave Bayern in search of regular first team football, and has agreed a deal to join Bundesliga newcomers Hertha Berlin for next season. Director of sport Christian Nerlinger said of the 21-year-old: ""I can understand that Thomas Kraft's aim is to be a first-choice goalkeeper, but we could not give him that guarantee.""","Hamit Altintop is one of three players who will leave Bayern Munich after Saturday .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan survived a no-confidence vote in parliament on Thursday. The final tally was 293 against the motion and 152 for it. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party filed the no-confidence motion Wednesday, and needed a simple majority for it to pass in parliament, and fell far short of that number. It cited his handling of the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and ensuing nuclear crisis as a reason for the motion. Had the motion passed, Kan would have been required to step down within 10 days or dissolve the lower house of parliament and force a snap election. A devastating tsunami struck Japan's Pacific coast after the massive earthquake in March, triggering the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl as the cores of reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant overheated and spewed radioactive chemicals. Kan, who was unpopular before the disaster, has come under fire as the nation battles to contain the nuclear and economic woes. Adding on to the problems, ratings agency Moody's Investors Service placed the country's local and foreign currency bond ratings on review for possible downgrade. Political in-fighting remains a problem in Japan, which has seen six prime ministers in the past five years. Last year, after only a few months in office, his main political opponent within his own party attempted to take control of the Democratic Party of Japan, effectively taking over the premiership. Kan managed to hold onto the title of party leader. Kan's one-year anniversary in office is June 8.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned Tuesday that any future NATO airstrikes that kill civilians will be considered attacks against the Afghan people. The statement came three days after an airstrike killed 14 civilians in southern Afghanistan, according to Afghan officials. ""This is my last warning to the NATO forces: No more attacks on the homes of Afghans will be allowed,"" Karzai told reporters. ""If they continue such operations to kill civilians, international forces will change to a force who is not fighting against terrorists but fighting against Afghan people."" Army Gen. David Petraeus, commander of NATO-led troops in Afghanistan, joined two other generals in offering ""sincere apologies"" Monday for the airstrike that killed nine civilians in Helmand province. There was no immediate explanation for the disparity between this figure and Karzai's account of 14 killed: 10 children, two women and two men. Maj. Gen. John Toolan, head of NATO's International Security Assistance Force command in southwest Afghanistan, pleaded with Afghans to not only forgive, but to also work with coalition forces in hopes of bolstering their security. ""I offer our heartfelt apologies to the families and friends of those killed,"" Toolan said in a statement. ""I ask that the Afghan people continue to trust and assist their security forces, so that together we can stop the senseless killing brought upon us by an enemy who wants to exploit the Afghan people through fear and violence."" Karzai said Tuesday that the international community has turned the war against terrorism into political objectives. ""They seek their own interest and played politics,"" Karzai said. ""...

"(CNN) -- Public attitudes about HIV and AIDS have changed dramatically since the first AIDS cases were reported 30 years ago. But in many parts of the world, the stigma is still powerful. CNN Hero Patricia Sawo, a pastor and AIDS activist in Kitale, Kenya, recently spoke with CNN's Kathleen Toner about how much has changed since she was diagnosed with HIV -- and how much work remains to be done. Kathleen Toner: What was the stigma like when you tested positive for HIV in 1999? Patricia Sawo: It was hard in those days. No one wanted to take care of people with AIDS. So for me, that was the worst part of it. I was going to die, and die alone. And I was worried not only for myself, but for my children. I was afraid. The stigma was the painful part of it. After I went public, within one week, I lost my job, my husband lost his job ... the landlord wanted us out of his house. If I'd died in those days, I was not going to die of AIDS. I was dying of the stigma. Toner: You mentioned your children. Did the stigma impact them? Sawo: My kids went through it because people knew I was HIV-positive. I remember one day I visited my children in school, and they were crying because their friends wouldn't play with them. Their parents had told them not to, because they said they might get infected. I was testing my children so they would know their own HIV status. So I told them (to tell the other children) that your parents are better than their parents, because at least they know their status and you know your status. Their parents probably don't even know their status, so they are the ones who are at risk. It caused a big problem in the school. But I had decided to educate the community. Toner: Tell me some of the other ways you're trying to change people's attitudes in your work as an AIDS activist. Sawo: I do a lot of work in the church. Before I tested HIV-positive, I personally believed that HIV was a disease for sinners. So for me, HIV was about people outside the church. I believed it, I preached it, and I thought if they changed their lives -- even if they are HIV-positive -- God would heal them. In 2002, I realized my attitude was wrong. HIV is not a moral issue. It is a virus which, with the correct information and knowledge, can be taken care of. So the church must change its attitude. The church leaders must change their way of preaching. Today, I do pastors workshops and train church leaders. I take them through HIV information and lead them to be able to begin congregational responses on HIV and AIDS. As church leaders, we need to shepherd and take care of the people, and that's why we need all information of all kinds. I'm also a trained HIV counselor and peer educator. There are also young people that I've mentored. I've taken them through accepting their status (as HIV-positive). And there are many young people that now go out in schools. They are teachers that I've helped who even speak about their HIV status in schools. Toner: You're doing so much work. Has the situation improved? Sawo: Things have gotten better where stigma has been reduced, because there, people have accurate information. But there are areas where people don't have the knowledge and look at it as a punishment or curse, or maybe as a traditional illness or taboo. ... We have to educate. Toner: What is your hope for the future? Sawo: My dream is that finally we will have an AIDS-free world. With the information that we have now, HIV is something we can deal with. People don't have to die of AIDS. HIV is something that can end with the people who have it. With the right information, attitude change and access to treatment, HIV can end with us. There's still a lot of work to do, especially in Africa. But HIV is something that we can overcome.

"(CNN) -- While the eyes of golfing world were on rising star Rory McIlroy on Thursday, two surprise names claimed the first-round lead at the British Open. A tearful Thomas Bjorn overcame the recent death of his father to shoot a superb five-under-par 65 despite difficult early conditions -- then late in the day 20-year-old amateur Tom Lewis shocked everyone by joining him at the top of the leaderboard with a record-breaking effort. The duo share a coach, but apart from that their stories could not be more different. The 40-year-old Bjorn was able to tee off at Royal St. George's -- where he blew his best chance of winning a major title in 2003 after squandering a four-shot lead on the last day -- only after several players pulled out, including Tiger Woods and lastly Vijay Singh on Monday. Ugly and unforgiving: Why Britain offers golf's toughest test . The Dane, 11 times a winner on the European Tour, has made the halfway cut just twice since his father passed away in May following a long illness, but at the windswept English links course he rediscovered the form that earned him two winning Ryder Cup appearances. ""Dad meant a lot to me,"" the world No. 80 told reporters before wiping tears from his eyes. ""He would have been very proud of what I did today. That's all I've really got to say about that. ""Today was a massive step in the right direction for me. I have been finding golf extremely difficult but I did a lot of work with (coach) Pete (Cowen) yesterday and some things just started to make a bit of sense. ""I don't know if I can keep this up for the rest of the week. The start-all-over process has taken a lot longer than I wanted to, but I suppose that's part of the process. Let's just say I have realized this year there's more important things in life than golf."" Lewis has already tasted success at Royal St. George's, having won the British boys' amateur title there in 2009. His father Brian, a former tour professional, named him after five-time British Open champion Tom Watson -- who was one of the Englishman's playing partners, with the 61-year-old American ending the day equal 71st after a 72. Showing no nerves in such illustrious company, Lewis carded the lowest round by an amateur at golf's oldest tournament, surpassing the 66 shot by Frank Stranahan in 1950, Tiger Woods (1996) and Justin Rose (1998). He also became the first non-professional to lead the tournament after the opening round since 1968. ""It was really great out there today,"" Lewis told reporters. ""When we started, I heard a lot of shouts like, 'Come on Tom' but I suspect they might have been for the other Tom, not me. But in the end I thought maybe there were a few for me, -- it would be nice to think so anyway."" Lewis birdied four of his last five holes to catch Bjorn as they took a one-shot advantage into Friday's second round from Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez and Americans Lucas Glover and Webb Simpson. Glover, who won the 2009 U.S. Open, finished with three successive birdies while Simpson -- still seeking his first professional title -- picked up shots at the last two. They were two shots ahead of a group of 12 players tied for sixth place, including U.S. PGA champion Martin Kaymer of Germany, 2010 U.S. Open winner Graeme McDowell and former European Ryder Cup star Darren Clarke. Among that cluster was American debutant Kyle Stanley, a 23-year-old who qualified for the 140th staging of the tournament when he finished second at the PGA Tour's John Deere Classic last weekend. McIlroy, playing for the first time since winning his breakthrough major at the U.S. Open three weeks ago, battled back from a bad start to card a one-over 71 for a share of 51st. The 22-year-old bogeyed two of his first three holes, but responded with birdies at the eighth, 13th and 17th holes to match the score of world No. 1 Luke Donald, second-ranked Lee Westwood, U.S. Open runner-up Jason Day of Australia and South Africa's Masters champion Charl Schwartzel. The Northern Irishman, seeking to be the youngest winner since 1893, led last year at St Andrew's after a first-round 63, but crashed with 80 in the second. ""I struggled a bit with my speed all day on the greens, but it was a day where you just needed to grind out a score, and anywhere around even par was a good start,"" McIlroy said. ""On a day like this you can shoot a high number and put yourself out of the golf tournament, so it was nice to go out and shoot a decent score. I feel like if you keep it around level par this week you're going to have a good chance."" Donald, who like Westwood has never won a major, is one of the favorites following his victory at last weekend's weather-shortened Scottish Open. The Englishman carded two birdies and a bogey in his front nine, but dropped three shots between 11 and 15 before pulling one back at 17. They were a shot better off than American Phil Mickelson, who was in another sizeable group tied for 36th on 70 that also included Spain's Sergio Garcia, after carding two birdies and two bogeys. Mickelson's compatriot John Daly, the 1995 winner, was tied for 71st on 72 along with South Africa's 2002 champion Ernie Els and reigning titleholder Louis Oosthuizen.","Thomas Bjorn takes early clubhouse lead in first round of British Open .

"(CNN) -- Hours after the inauguration of President Goodluck Jonathan, a bomb blast rocked the northern Nigerian city of Bauchi, a government spokesman said. Yushau Shuaib, a spokesman for Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency, confirmed that there are several casualties, though he did not give a specific number. ""Most victims were moved to hospitals and dead bodies were evacuated,"" he said. The emergency management agency has been mobilized ""to contain the situation,"" Shuaib added. Another explosion rattled a beer hall in Zuba, on the outskirts of the Nigerian capital of Abuja. Shuaib said there were no serious injuries in that blast, with three victims taking themselves to a nearby hospital. In recent weeks, the African nation has been rocked by a series of bombings thought to be engineered by Boko Haram, an Islamic group that has challenged Nigeria's government. Explosions in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno killed a few and wounded dozens in late April in the days leading up to national governorship elections in attacks that police described as attempts to intimidate voters who had picked Jonathan. Northern Muslims in some areas charged that the presidential election was rigged. Armed protesters in the region took to the streets chanting the name of former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, the main opposition front-runner. This is Jonathan's first full term. As vice president, he took over the presidency in May 2010 upon the death of then-President Umaru Yar'Adua, who had suffered from a heart condition.","NEW: 3 hurt in a blast at a beer hall near Abuja, a government official says .

"(CNN) -- A single hair that shows evidence of decomposition was similar to that of Casey Anthony's 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, an FBI evidence analyst testified at the Orlando, Florida, woman's trial Saturday. Investigators found the hair in the trunk of Casey Anthony's car. Prosecutors are trying to link the hair to Caylee as evidence that her body was in the car. But defense attorney Jose Baez attacked FBI trace evidence examiner Karen Lowe's findings as little more than unreliable opinion in a morning of fitful testimony that produced frequent objections and huddles among the attorneys out of earshot of the jury. A crime scene investigator, the operator of a towing company and members of Anthony's family all have testified they smelled a bad odor coming from Anthony's car after it was found abandoned in a parking lot on June 27, 2008, then towed four days later. Caylee was last reported seen by her family on June 16, 2008, but no one alerted police until July 15, 2008 -- after the girl's grandmother tracked Anthony down and demanded answers. Caylee's skeletal remains were found in December 2008. Anthony, 25, is charged with seven counts in Caylee's death, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading police. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. Prosecutors say she used chloroform on her daughter and then put duct tape on her nose and mouth to suffocate her. She has pleaded not guilty and has denied having anything to do with the girl's disappearance or death. The Orlando woman's attorneys argue Caylee drowned in the family pool on June 16, 2008. They say Anthony and her father panicked and covered up the death. George Anthony denied the claim during his testimony last week. Testimony about the hair marks a departure from the dramatic testimony and evidence of the last nine days, in which friends and acquaintances contradicted Anthony's claims that she was frantically searching for her daughter during the month she was missing. Instead, according to evidence and testimony in the case, she was spending time with her boyfriend, shopping and going to nightclubs. In dry, scientific terms, FBI trace evidence analyst Karen Lowe testified Saturday how a 9-inch piece of hair sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, appeared similar to a piece of hair recovered from a brush belonging to the girl. But she said hair analysis is not as precise as DNA analysis, so she could not say with absolute certainty that the hair belonged to the girl. The hair had a dark band that Lowe testified has only been seen in hairs remaining in the scalp of a decomposing body. A crime scene investigator, Gerardo Bloise, testified Friday that he recovered a human hair from the trunk of Anthony's car, and also that the car smelled of decomposition. In cross-examination, Baez questioned the validity of Lowe's testimony, first asking if there was any way to prove how the hair got into the trunk. ""I couldn't say how the hair got there,"" Lowe said. ""It's consistent with transfer or contact of some sort, but I don't know from whom."" She also testified under questioning from Baez that while the hair is clearly not Casey Anthony's, it could belong to any other light-haired relative on her mother's side of the family. The kind of DNA testing authorities were able to perform on the sample reveals DNA passed down only through maternal lines. Lowe also testified there are no standards for identifying the bands and that such decisions are based on her opinion and that of a fellow investigator. Baez also questioned Lowe's experience, saying she had failed a 2000 proficiency test and that she has never before testified on hair banding. He also questioned the entire premise of hair analysis, citing a 2009 National Academies of Science report that broadly questioned the use of microscopic hair analysis and other forensic science results in criminal cases. Lowe said she agreed with the report's findings -- that hair can't uniquely identify an individual and that it's important to send samples for DNA analysis, which she said she did in the Anthony case. Lowe, who is not a DNA expert, has not testified about the findings of the those tests. The hair in question was recovered after Anthony's car was picked up from her family's home, after it had been abandoned in a parking lot, towed to an impound lot and then driven back to the family home two weeks later by Anthony's father. According to testimony, Anthony asked her boyfriend to pick her up from the parking lot on June 27, saying the car had run out of gas. She also told a friend that she believed an animal carcass was lodged in her car's frame. The car was towed to an impound lot on June 30, 2008, where a manager said he also smelled the odor of decomposition. An analysis of the car after the Orange County Sheriff's Office took possession of it did not show any such evidence, Bloise testified. Also on Saturday, Orange County crime scene investigator Mike Vincent told jurors about collecting air samples from inside Anthony's car. A scientist later found evidence of chloroform and gases associated with decomposition in those samples. Baez questioned whether the air inside the trunk on August 29, 2008, when it was tested, was the same as that in the car when it was recovered in July. He also sought to raise a question whether a trash bag found in the car when it was recovered might have been the source of the smell. Vincent also sampled air from the inside of that bag. The contents of the bag were dry when Vincent tested the air inside, he testified. The trash might have smelled different when, and if, it was wet, Vincent said under questioning from Baez. Before prosecutors began presenting scientific evidence in the case on Friday, jurors watched recordings of jailhouse visits between Anthony and her parents. In one conversation played Friday, Anthony scoffed at a media report her mother brought up speculating that Caylee had drowned in the family swimming pool. ""Surprise, surprise,"" Anthony said of the rumor, which is now the primary defense theory in her capital murder trial in Orlando. In recordings of visits played for the jury, Anthony frequently accused the media of failing to accurately report on the case. A videotaped exchange, during which Anthony became agitated with her parents as they pressed her for details of Caylee's whereabouts, was one in a series shown to jurors the past two days. ""We need to have something to go on,"" Cindy Anthony pleaded during the visit. ""Mom, I'm sorry. I don't have anything,"" Casey Anthony angrily replied. ""I've been here a month. Do you understand how I feel?"" Some legal experts say these taped conversations could hurt Anthony in the eyes of jurors. ""These tapes are so devastating to the defense,"" defense attorney Richard Herman told HLN's Nancy Grace. ""Now at this point, there is no way Casey Anthony can take the stand in the case. They cannot get an acquittal."" Prosecutors allege Anthony was not looking for her daughter during the month she was missing. Instead, she was staying with her boyfriend, spending time in Orlando with numerous friends, attending parties, going shopping and hitting nightclubs, including participating in a ""hot body"" contest, according to evidence in the case. Her former boyfriend, friends and acquaintances have all testified that she did not mention her daughter being missing during that time and that they noticed nothing different about her demeanor. Anthony's defense team explains her behavior in the weeks following Caylee's death by saying she had been sexually abused by her father and had been taught to conceal her pain. George Anthony has denied abusing his daughter. The trial will resume Monday morning. Prosecutors expect their case will take two more weeks, after which Baez will begin to mount the defense case. Overall, the trial is likely to last another four to six weeks, based on initial projections. Watch Nancy Grace Monday through Sunday starting at 8 p.m. ET on HLN.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Tuesday that he invited Democratic and Republican leaders from both chambers of Congress to the White House for a meeting Thursday to discuss deficit reduction and the need to raise the federal debt ceiling. Obama said he wanted the meeting to ""build on the work that's already been done and drive toward a final agreement"" that would address expanding federal deficits and bring congressional approval for increasing how much money the government can borrow. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who earlier invited Obama to come to Congress to discuss the issue, will attend the White House meeting, his office announced. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also plans to attend, and House Speaker John Boehner indicated that he will take part but warned that Congress will not accept tax increases sought by Obama and Democrats. ""I'm happy to discuss these issues at the White House, but such discussions will be fruitless until the president recognizes economic and legislative reality,"" Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement. He added, ""I'm pleased the president stated today that we need to address the big, long-term challenges facing our country."" According to Obama, who made an unscheduled appearance in the White House briefing room, talks on deficit reduction over the Fourth of July weekend with congressional leaders from both parties made progress, but ""we still have to work through some real differences."" Both parties need to come out of their ""comfort zone,"" Obama said. But ""this should not come down to the last second."" White House spokesman Jay Carney later said Obama believes that everyone knows the issues involved in forging a comprehensive agreement to reduce federal deficits by as much as $4 trillion in the coming decade. Now it is time make hard decisions, with both sides compromising in order to reach an agreement that benefits the nation as a whole, Carney said. ""The ideal will never become law, whether you're a conservative House Republican or a liberal Democrat or the president of the United States,"" Carney said. ""You're never going to get everything you want, because our system doesn't work like that."" The Senate returned to work Tuesday, cutting short the planned weeklong Fourth of July recess, with its leaders resuming their tough talk on negotiations to cut federal deficits amid a looming deadline to raise the government's debt ceiling. The three-day Fourth of July weekend did little to change the rhetoric of recent weeks over deficit reduction talks and the need for Congress to increase the amount of money the government can borrow. In his opening remarks after the Senate reconvened, Reid, D-Nevada, accused Republicans of putting the nation's economic recovery at risk by threatening to oppose an increase in how much money the government can borrow. McConnell, R-Kentucky, followed Reid by accusing Democrats of wanting to increase spending to solve a deficit problem. Before Obama's invitation, McConnell repeated an invitation for Obama to come to Congress and hear from Republicans why they won't support any agreement that includes tax increases. Reid said his side was willing to compromise but would not allow Republicans to put the needs of ""a few millionaires and billionaires"" ahead of the rest of the country. With House members scheduled to return Wednesday, congressional leaders remain at sharp odds over what sort of conditions should be attached to a hike in the current $14.3 trillion ceiling. Republicans are refusing to go along with any increase unless it includes deep spending cuts and avoids any tax increases.  Democrats are trying to minimize the impact of cuts to social services and are calling for the elimination to certain tax breaks and loopholes benefiting wealthier Americans. Treasury Department officials and leading economists have warned of potentially catastrophic consequences if the ceiling is not raised by August 2, at which point the country could default on its debt obligations. Among other things, the country could face skyrocketing interest rates and a plummeting dollar. Increasing the debt ceiling will allow the government to borrow more money in order to pay for spending already accrued. Given the short time frame, Congress and the White House may be forced to agree to a relatively small increase in the debt ceiling covering only a few months. Such a compromise -- including cuts already agreed to on both sides of the aisle -- would give leaders more time to negotiate serious budget reforms, including possible changes to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. However, Obama said he's opposed to a short-term increase in the debt ceiling. ""I don't think the American people sent us here to avoid tough problems,"" Obama said. The debt ceiling dispute is a ""'unique opportunity to do something big"" and put the ""economy on a stronger footing for the future."" Over the weekend, top Democrats and Republicans gave no public indication that a potential compromise is in the offing.  Talks led by Vice President Joe Biden recently collapsed over the tax dispute. ""The principle of not raising taxes is something that we campaigned on last November, and the results of the election was the American people don't want their taxes raised and they wanted us to cut spending,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""They don't want compromise."" Various frameworks for a possible deal have been floated. Conservatives demand deep spending cuts, caps on future spending and a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution in return for their support to raise the debt ceiling. Both the House and Senate are planning votes on a balanced budget amendment in coming weeks. However, with such an amendment requiring approval from a two-thirds majority in both chambers and then ratification by at least 38 states, eventual approval is unclear in a process that can take years. For his part, Obama has chided congressional Republicans for refusing to make ""tough decisions"" at odds with their conservative base. He calls for what he characterizes as a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes more revenue for education, infrastructure and clean energy, areas he considers critical to long-term economic growth. The Democratic position includes spending cuts elsewhere, including the military, as well as reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, the government-run health care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the indigent. Republicans seek more sweeping entitlement reforms that Democrats contend would eliminate the safety net the programs were intended to provide.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The United Nations nuclear watchdog agency said Wednesday that Japan underestimated the hazard posed by tsunamis to nuclear plants but praised the country's response to the Fukushima Daiichi crisis as ""exemplary."" The International Atomic Energy Agency announced a preliminary summary of safety issues related to the crippled power plant. The plant was damaged after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern Japan and killed more than 14,000 people and left another 10,000 people missing. An international team of nuclear experts from 12 countries participated in a fact-finding mission and completed its preliminary assessment Wednesday, the agency said. The team said nuclear designers and operators should ""evaluate and provide protection against the risks of all natural hazards."". ""These tsunami waves overwhelmed the defenses of TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi facility, which were only designed to withstand tsunami waves of a maximum of 5.7 meters (18.7 feet) high. The larger waves that impacted this facility on that day were estimated to be larger than 14 meters (46 feet) high,"" the report said, referring to the plant's owners, Tokyo Electric Power Co. ""The tsunami waves reached areas deep within units causing the loss of all power sources except for one emergency diesel generator ... with no other significant power source available on or off the site, and little hope of outside assistance."" The team also said despite the ""brave and sometimes novel"" efforts by operational staff to control and cool reactors and spent fuel, the fuel was severely damaged and a series of explosions occurred. ""The operators were faced with a catastrophic, unprecedented emergency scenario with no power, reactor control or instrumentation,"" the summary said. ""They had to work in darkness with almost no instrumentation and control systems to secure the safety of six reactors, six associated fuel pools, a common fuel pool, and dry cask storage facilities."" Team leader Mike Weightman, the UK's chief inspector of nuclear installations, said the team was humbled by massive damage caused by the tsunami. ""We are also profoundly impressed by the dedication of Japanese workers working to resolve this unprecedented nuclear accident,"" Weightman said in an agency statement. The team also praised Japan's ""long-term"" response, including the ""impressive and well organized"" evacuation of the area around the stricken reactors. ""A suitable and timely follow-up program on public and worker exposures and health monitoring would be beneficial,"" the team said. The draft report summary was delivered to Japanese authorities Wednesday, the agency said. A final report will be delivered to the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety at the agency's headquarters in Vienna in late June.","International nuclear experts assess safety issues stemming from Fukushima Daiichi .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- At least one demonstrator died and a bodyguard protecting Turkey's prime minister was hospitalized after clashes erupted around a campaign rally Tuesday, less than two weeks before Turks go to the polls to vote in parliamentary elections. The violence erupted in the Black Sea town of Hopa, where Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was scheduled to address a rally. Turkish television showed protesters hurling stones and climbing police barricades, as security forces fired tear gas and water cannons to break up the demonstration. An emergency room doctor confirmed to CNN that a demonstrator named Metin Lokumcu died of a heart attack after being brought to the emergency room of Hopa State Hospital. But in a statement released on the website of the opposition Freedom and Solidarity Party (ODP), the party's deputy chairman Onder Isleyen accused Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of killing the protester. ""As a result of the AKP's murderous attack, our brother and friend Metin Lokumcu died,"" Isleyen wrote. ""The AKP is attacking the public everywhere using tear gas and batons."" Two officials with Erdogan's entourage, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that a demonstrator died in Hopa on Wednesday, though one of the officials told CNN the man died as the result of a heart attack. Later in the day, a small group of demonstrators hurled stones at Erdogan's campaign bus as it was leaving the scene. ""One of the stones hit a bodyguard on the head and he fell off the bus, and when he fell he also hit his head on the ground,"" said one of the officials with Erdogan's campaign, again speaking on condition of anonymity. Turkish television news filmed dramatic footage of the bodyguard tumbling from the bus, apparently unconscious as it sped down the street. The bodyguard was later hospitalized with head-wounds. At a subsequent campaign rally in the Black Sea port of Trabzon, Erdogan lashed out at the protesters, calling them ""bandits."" ""Bandits with stones in their hands came to Hopa and unfortunately, of course, they attacked our vehicles with stones,"" Erdogan said. Hours later, several hundred flag-waving demonstrators from leftist and secularist political parties hurled bottles and debris at riot police in Istanbul and chanted ""murderers"" as they ripped down a giant campaign poster of Erdogan. Polls predict Erdogan's party will win another term in office in parliamentary elections scheduled for June 12. The party has been in power since it swept to an initial electoral victory 2002.","Violence erupted as the prime minister was scheduled to address a rally .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It's Friday -- awesome! -- and I'm Carl Azuz. First up today, a headline that some people have waited 15 years to hear. First Up: Ratko Mladic Captured . AZUZ: Ratko Mladic, the former commander of Serbian forces in Bosnia, has been arrested. This conflict in Bosnia happened back in the 1990s. It was the deadliest war fought in Europe since World War II. And Mladic was the highest ranking war crimes suspect who hadn't been caught. Bosnia was part of the former country of Yugoslavia. The war there lasted from 1992 to 1995. Serbians, Croats and Muslims fought against each other for control of territory. Serbian leaders, like Mladic, are accused of genocide, attempting to wipe out the other groups. Mladic was the leader of Bosnian Serb forces who allegedly attacked the city of Srebrenica and killed thousands of Muslims. Only one other top Serb leader is currently held and awaiting trial. And with Mladic now in custody, Hala Gorani looks back at some of the reaction to what could be the end of this dark chapter in history. (BEGIN VIDEO) HALA GORANI, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: After almost 16 years on the run, one of the world's most wanted alleged war criminals is finally captured. Serbian authorities arrested Ratko Mladic Thursday. They reportedly caught up with him in Lazarevo, a village near the northern town of Zrenjanin. Mladic was a Bosnian Serb general during the Balkan wars of the 1990s, and the highest-ranking Yugoslav war crimes suspect still at large. He's wanted for genocide, extermination and murder, and is accused of masterminding the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica. LORD DAVID OWEN, FORMER EU ENVOY TO FORMER YUGOSLAVIA: General Mladic has a very heavy responsibility for what was a tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina for many years, but particularly for the massacre of over 8,000 Muslim males, which has already been judged to be a genocide. GORANI: The capture was praised internationally as a victory for the rule of law in Serbia. ANDERS FOGH RASMUSSEN, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: The arrest of Ratko Mladic is a very important step towards full integration of the entire region in our Euro-Atlantic community. GORANI: Mladic now faces extradition to the Netherlands and will eventually be tried by an international criminal tribunal. JAMES RUBIN, FORMER U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE: When I was the State Department spokesman back in the late '90s, journalists every day would often ask what's happening with Mladic, what's happening with Karadzic, and all I could say at the time was his day will come. And his day has finally come. OWEN: I expect to see him in the Hague very soon, and I think that justice will then be done. GORANI: Hala Gorani, reporting. (END VIDEO) Shoutout .

Mr. Sarkozy has been the president of France for four years. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! G8 Meeting in France . AZUZ: Right now, President Sarkozy is welcoming other world leaders as France hosts the annual meeting of the G8, or Group of Eight. Along with France, the G8 includes the U.S., Britain, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and Russia. These are the world's biggest economic powers. They meet every year to discuss major issues happening around the globe. The group got together yesterday in France. And in addition to big topics -- like the global economy, the environment, terrorism -- the recent Japanese earthquake and tsunami also came up. Japan's prime minister thanked President Obama for America's help in recovering from that disaster. Immigration Law . AZUZ: The U.S. Supreme Court is ruling on whether state or federal laws take priority when it comes to immigration reform. A majority of the court ruled in favor of an Arizona law. It punishes businesses that don't use a federal system to check a potential employee's immigration status. Other groups had argued that the system is supposed to be voluntary. There are several cases involving this ""state versus federal"" question, so we could hear more on this very soon. Why So Many Tornadoes? AZUZ: Officials in Missouri have released a list of more than 230 people missing since a tornado hit the city of Joplin on Sunday. They're asking anyone with information to call in and help. The tornado in Joplin was just one of the storms that has torn across the U.S. Rob Marciano is here to explain the science behind how these twisters form. Rob? ROB MARCIANO, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR: The set-up across the U.S. is different from any other place in the world, where you have cold Canadian air that comes down from, obviously Canada. And this time of year in May and April, we still have cold air at the upper levels of the atmosphere, because it's not quite totally warmed up. And we have warm humid air coming in from the south, and then also dry air coming in from Mexico. It makes this year a little bit different. At least earlier on, we have this La Nina that we've talked about, and what that does it really starts to kink up the jet stream a little bit more than usual, and that gives it more energy. That allows more cold air to drop down, and that allows the battleground to light up a little bit more. Blog Promo . AZUZ: On our blog at CNNStudentNews.com, you'll see a list of this school year's top stories. Severe weather is definitely one of them. We want to include your thoughts in our year-end wrap-up. Go to the blog, leave your comments on these stories. You might see them in our show next Friday. Don't Fry Day . AZUZ: Today, obviously, is Friday. But some organizations have dubbed today ""Don't Fry Day."" Hmm? Brooke Baldwin is going to shine a light on what this is about. (BEGIN VIDEO) BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: The National Sun Safety Day, also known as ""Don't Fry Day,"" is a campaign by the EPA and members of the National Council on Skin Cancer Awareness. Now in its third year, Don't Fry Day is aimed at educating the public about skin protection in the sun. It's held just before Memorial Day weekend. DRUSILLA HUFFORD, EPA: Our hope in holding it on the Friday before Memorial Day really has been to peg to the expectation in most American families that that is the gateway to summer. As of now, 1 in 5 Americans is expected to be diagnosed with skin cancer over a lifetime. So, EPA and the National Council are asking folks to remember to slip, slop, slap and wrap. First, slip on some protective clothing. Secondly, wear sunscreen. Next, slap on a hat. Finally, wrap on some sunglasses. BALDWN: Dermatologist Rutledge Forney says sunscreen is key. DR. RUTLEDGE FORNEY, DERMATOLOGIST: The first thing they ought to look for is a large number. We really believe that 30 or higher is very important. The second thing is that they need to have a broad spectrum, that is UVA and UVB coverage. (END VIDEO) Is This Legit? ERDMAN, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Memorial Day used to be known as Decoration Day. This is true! And the holiday always falls on the last Monday in May. Honoring the Fallen . AZUZ: The holiday that Americans observe on Monday goes back almost 150 years. It was named Decoration Day because the first people who observed it would decorate -- put flowers -- on the graves of troops killed in the U.S. Civil War. So why late May? Well, it's believed this time of year was chosen because flowers are in bloom all across the nation. This is Arlington National Cemetery. It's where the first major Decoration Day observance was held in 1868, though smaller observances were made throughout the country before that. Instead of flowers, today's military usually places small American flags beside more than 250,000 graves at Arlington. The flags will stay there through Memorial Day. But Decoration Day, Memorial Day, how did we get from one name to the other? The Great War, the war to end all wars; what's known today as World War I. It not only changed the world, it changed how the U.S. remembers its fallen troops. After this brutal event, Decoration Day became Memorial Day to memorialize Americans killed in any of the nation's wars. This is what distinguishes this holiday from Veterans Day, which honors anyone who's served in the U.S. Armed Forces. And while Memorial Day's traditions have changed over the years, its significance remains. At 3:00 p.m., wherever you are on Memorial Day, there's a National Moment of Remembrance. It encourages you to pause for one minute in honor of those who've died fighting for the country. Before We Go . AZUZ: Well, before we go today, we have proof for you that one person really can make a difference. The flag flying over the pier in Oceanside, California was pretty torn up. So, Luke Smith decided to do something about it. He wrote a letter to the mayor. The eight-year-old said that flying a torn flag was disrespectful to the country and its troops. He asked the mayor to replace it. Done! New flag flying, all thanks to one person's determination. Goodbye . AZUZ: Time for us to wave goodbye. No show on Monday due to Memorial Day. Enjoy the long weekend. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz.","Serbian authorities arrest an alleged war criminal from the Bosnian War .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Specialist military divers have arrived at the site where a Russian cruise ship sank over the weekend, killing more than 100 people, the Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday. The highly trained divers, who specialize in rescue operations and lifting sunken ships, have orders to present a plan to raise the ""Bulgaria"" from the Volga River as soon as possible, the ministry said in a press release. Some of the divers participated in lifting the Russian nuclear submarine ""Kursk,"" which exploded and sank in the Barents Sea in August 2000, the Defense Ministry said. The bodies of two more children were recovered Wednesday from the ship, Russian authorities told CNN, bringing the number of bodies recovered to 102.  There are still 20 people missing of the more than 200 people believed to have been on the vessel, officials said. At least 85 of the victims have been identified, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. Four people face charges over the sinking of the ship Sunday, which Russian media are calling the most devastating river accident in the country's history.  The vessel went down in the Russian republic of Tatarstan. Svetlana Inyakina, general director of Argorechtur, the company that rented the cruise boat ""Bulgaria,"" and Yakov Ivashov, a manager at the Kama River Register, have been detained, Russia's Investigative Committee said. They are charged with providing services that do not meet safety standards which resulted in multiple deaths, and if convicted could be jailed for up to 10 years. Criminal charges are also being brought against the captains of two ships that are accused of passing the sinking boat without stopping to help the people in the water, the committee said. They could face heavy fines or up to three years in prison. Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin, who is also head of the special government commission investigating the accident, said divers will search around the clock until all of the victims are found.  Recovery efforts will also include small planes conducting reconnaissance flights as far as 80 miles downstream, the minister said. There were 175 scuba divers working on the scene, authorities said Tuesday. Russian state TV said they were working underwater in low visibility and against a heavy current that is moving the boat, which is lying at the bottom of the river. Russia observed a day of mourning Tuesday with church services all across the country, flags flying at half-staff and national television canceling all entertainment programming. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the federal government would pay 1 million rubles ($35,500) to the families of each of the dead. He also promised 400,000 rubles ($14,250) to those who suffered major and moderately severe injuries, and half that sum to people with minor injuries. Among the bodies to have been recovered are those of the ship's captain Alexander Ostrovsky and his wife, local officials in Tatarstan told Russian media at the site of the accident. At least 79 people were rescued, some of whom have been released from hospitals after receiving medical treatment, according to government agencies. The ship did not have a license to transport passengers, was overloaded, and was last repaired more than 30 years ago, the Russian Prosecutor's Office said Monday. Prosecutors also established that the left engine of the ship was damaged, they said on their website. Russian state TV reported the vessel had an operational limit of about 150 passengers, citing a top government official on site. State TV also reported, citing law enforcement officials, that there were life vests on board for only 156 people. Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu said earlier there were 208 people aboard the ship, of whom 25 passengers were not officially registered and didn't have tickets. The state news agency RIA Novosti reported that 205 people were on board. The ferry was built in 1955 in Czechoslovakia, according to Russian law enforcement officials. The double-deck cruise ship went down near the village of Syukeyevo in Tatarstan, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the city of Kazan. Kazan is about 724 kilometers (450 miles) east of Moscow.

"(CNN) -- Six members of Pakistan's paramilitary forces accused of killing an unarmed teenager last week have been turned over to police and will be tried under the country's terrorism act, a police official said Monday. The Supreme Court has sent the case to an anti-terrorist court, which was ordered to conclude proceedings within a month, said Ahtisham Ali, a senior Karachi police official. Anti-Terrorist Courts in Pakistan are special courts where hearings are expedited and decisions come more quickly than in the regular court system. The accused -- members of the Sindh Rangers -- can be seen opening fire on 17-year-old Sarfraz Shah in a chilling video captured by a local television cameraman and broadcast across Pakistan's networks last week. Before being shot twice, Shah pleads with the men carrying automatic rifles. ""I am helpless,"" he cries. ""Please do not fire."" Shah begs to be taken to a hospital before bleeding to death. The incident was the latest in a series of human rights incidents that has horrified the south Asian nation and deeply eroded public confidence in security agencies. ""This kind of anger among the public and even politicians hasn't been seen before,"" said Zohra Yusuf, chairwoman of the Pakistan Human Rights Commission. ""It was the way the young man was brutally shot dead in close quarters,"" she said. ""And the footage showed very clearly that he was not armed. The footage itself is so crystal clear. It tells the whole story."" Shah tried to rob people at a park named in honor of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Karachi police official Rafiq Gulsaid Shah pointed a pistol and wanted to steal cash and cell phones. He was handed over to park security and then to the Rangers. Shah apparently tried to snatch the Rangers' guns, Gul said. That's when the soldiers opened fire. The video shows Shah reaching for their weapons before backing away. Pakistan's Supreme Court ordered Friday transfers for the heads of the Sindh Rangers and the provincial police force, according to Ikram Chaudhry, a senior Supreme Court lawyer. Interior Minister Rehman Malik vowed justice but tempered his comments about Shah. ""There should be no doubt that this video shows an unjust action,"" he said. ""Action will be taken against the soldiers, but no one should forget he [the victim] is a criminal. He pointed a pistol at two women and then he tried to rob them. ""There are two things -- one, his criminal record, and another, an unjust killing,"" Malik said. ""I assure the relatives of the victim the investigation will be transparent and neutral and the results will be made public. These are the criminals that create problems for the public, but it does not justify killing like this."" Shah's family insisted that the Rangers had killed an innocent man. ""My son was innocent,"" his mother said. ""They killed him."" CNN's Phil Black and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","A 17-year-old man is shot in video that horrified the nation when it was broadcast .

"(CNN) -- The Bolivian government expelled an Iranian minister to avoid a diplomatic rift with Argentina, the country's foreign minister said. Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi is wanted in Argentina for his alleged role in planning the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994 that killed 85 people. Interpol has issued a ""red notice"" for Vahidi, which seeks other governments' help in detaining him for possible extradition. An Argentine umbrella organization for the Jewish community, DAIA, demanded that the Bolivians arrest Vahidi once they learned of his official visit. Bolivia opted to ask him to immediately leave the country instead. In a letter to his Argentine counterpart, Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said that Bolivia was ""unfortunately unaware"" of Vahidi's history. Bolivia values its relations with Argentina, and acted for that reason, he wrote. Bolivia asked Vahidi ""to immediately abandon Bolivian territory and in this way demonstrate with clarity that Bolivia does not wish to interfere with any legal proceedings that could exist."" The letter didn't address the Interpol notice and why the country had not acted upon it and arrested Vahidi. Vahidi was in Bolivia at the invitation of the country's defense ministry to attend the inauguration of a military academy for members of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our Americas, or ALBA. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his allies founded the group a few years ago in an attempt, they said, to counterbalance United States influence in Latin America. Bolivian President Evo Morales also was present at the event. In remarks during his visit to Bolivia, Vahidi said that Iran is prepared to ""deliver a firm response"" to any provocations from the United States, the state-run Press TV reported.","Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi was on an official visit to Bolivia .

"(Mashable)  -- What would you do after Cisco killed your beloved product? For Jonathan Kaplan, the inventor of the Flip video camera, the answer was simple: start a venture-backed nationwide chain of grilled cheese sandwich joints. That may sound like Kaplan has lost his marbles, but bear with us. Kaplan's genius, as shown in the highly popular Flip, is creating super-easy, mass-produced technology. With his new business, The Melt, he's done that twice over. Buy a grilled cheese on your smartphone, and you get a QR code to swipe in store when you arrive. The back-end software ensures that you get a piping hot grilled cheese in your hands within 60 seconds of checking in. Kaplan has also invested a lot of effort on making his grilled cheese hardware easy and effective. He tapped European appliance giant Electrolux to create a brand-new grill with a built-in microwave. It nukes the cheese for 15 seconds, then toasts the bread for another 30 seconds. We can confirm that the resulting sandwiches, doing the rounds here at the D9 conference, were uniformly tasty. Win or lose, you can't deny that Kaplan has put a lot of thought into this scheme. He found a breadmaker in Chicago whose bread was kneaded in such a way that it created air bubbles for the cheese to fill. He's pairing different kinds of bread with different kinds of cheese, as well as simple but tasty soups (The Melt's only other sale item, apart from Crackerjacks). Sandwiches will go for $5 apiece, or $8 with soup. ""We're selling nostalgia and happiness,"" Kaplan told Mashable. ""Grilled cheese makes people happy."" Evidently, his backers at Sequoia Capital agreed. Kaplan won't say how much funding he received, but he plans to start more than 500 Melt locations in the next four years. Each store will cost between $500,000 and $1 million. You do the math. Famed VC Michael Moritz is sitting on the board, as is Apple retail head Ron Johnson, and the first handful of stores will open in San Francisco in August. Some will stay open as late as 2 a.m., a big deal in a town that largely shuts down at 10 p.m. Another reason the whole Melt concept might work out better than expected? One word: calories. Put a grilled cheese sandwich and a cup of soup next to just about any other fast food option, and it's going to look like a plate of greens. Chipotle may be able to offer you online ordering (and Chipotle, by the way, is a $9 billion business), but good luck working off the 500-odd extra calories a burrito is going to give you compared to the Melt's offerings.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli and Lebanese forces traded fire Monday, with each blaming the other for the exchange. No one was hurt. Israel said its soldiers were fired upon while on routine patrol along Lebanon's border. The soldiers then returned fire, the military said. Lebanon's national news agency said a southern Lebanese army post came under fire from Israeli forces, prompting Lebanese soldiers to fire back. Fifteen Israeli soldiers advanced 50 meters inside Lebanese territories, security sources told the news agency. The National News Agency of Lebanon said the gunfire lasted 15 minutes and that Israel bolstered its presence in the area with 10 personnel carriers, three tanks and 100 soldiers. ""We will implement the Israeli sovereignty and ensure the safety of our citizens,"" the Israeli military said in a message to the United Nations Interim Fore in Lebanon (UNIFIL). UNIFIL troops are deployed along the Blue Line separating Lebanon and Israel to reduce tensions between the two sides. In an unrelated incident in the West Bank, five Israeli soldiers were lightly injured overnight when they were pelted with rocks during an arrest at the Kalandia refugee camp, a military spokesman said Monday. Israel said it received a report about injuries to two Palestinians during the incident and was investigating, while hospital officials in Ramallah said two men were killed and one injured.

"(CNN) -- The longtime companion of notorious fugitive James ""Whitey"" Bulger pleaded not guilty in Boston Thursday to charges she harbored and concealed him, said a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. Catherine E. Greig, 60, who is being held without bail, allegedly assisted Bulger from January 1995 until June, when the pair was arrested in California, the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement last week. ""It is alleged that Greig conspired to take steps to prevent Bulger's discovery and arrest, after knowledge of the fact that a warrant had been issued for his apprehension,"" the office said. Greig's attorney, Kevin Reddington, did not immediately return calls for comment Thursday. According to the indictment, Greig and Bulger posed as a married couple under different false identities and claimed to be from states other than Massachusetts. She would shop and handle bills so that Bulger would ""minimize his time in public,"" it asserts. Government prosecutors last month released a series of photographs showing cash, weapons and even a grenade recovered from the Santa Monica, California, apartment where Bulger and Greig apparently lived for 15 years while he was being hunted by the FBI. If convicted of the charges against her, Greig could be sentenced to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine, according to the U.S. Attorney's office. Bulger has pleaded not guilty to all counts against him, including his alleged role in 19 murders. Prosecutors say Bulger was the head of a South Boston Irish gang before he fled an impending racketeering indictment in 1995.

"Havana (CNN) -- The founders of Cuba's biggest independent music festival accused the government of ""kidnapping"" their festival on Wednesday, saying the Culture Ministry had taken over organization of this year's event and barred them from meetings. ""They're kidnapping, stealing our festival,"" said founder and until-now executive director Michel Matos. ""It's not a simple case of censorship, of them shutting it down. It's an abduction,"" he said during a small press conference in his living room. ""On the one hand, they're taking it away from us and on the other hand, they are organizing it themselves through official institutions."" The government was not immediately available for comment. The Rotilla Festival, a hugely popular three-day rave on a beach outside Havana, was launched in 1998 by Matos and a handful of friends. Last year, it attracted some 20,000 people. ""Up until now, we were tolerated,"" Matos said. Often referred to as ""Cuba's Woodstock,"" the festival's focus has traditionally been on apolitical electronic music and DJs, although last year the main attraction was the polemic hip-hop group Los Aldeanos. Matos said they collaborated with government officials on logistics and security and sometimes faced pressure. ""Traditionally, there was a dialogue with authorities, where they pressured us so that certain groups wouldn't participate and we cooperated so that the festival would be permitted,"" he said. ""It hasn't always been comfortable."" Less well-known outside Cuba than some of the smaller, more political, rap festivals, Rotilla has long been a popular musical event for young people on the island. The festival was financially independent, receiving funding from the Serbian electronic music festival EXIT and the Dutch and Spanish embassies. The bands and DJs played for free. Matos said the Cuban government had taken over the festival without any warning or explanation. When organizers came to a meeting on logistics and security with local authorities, they were met in the parking lot and told they were no longer the organizers, he said. They have since been barred from meetings at the Culture Ministry, where he said plans are underway to stage a ""Rotilla Festival"" organized by the government on the same dates, but with a different lineup. The bands are being offered $1,000, he said.","Rotilla was largely apolitical 3-day rave .

"(CNN)  -- Holders Brazil needed a last-gasp equalizer from Fred to salvage a 2-2 draw against Paraguay in their Copa America Group B match Saturday in Cordoba. It was another lackluster performance from the five-time world champions after being held to a goalless draw by Venezuela in the opening match of their title defense. They took a first half lead through Jadson, but trailed 2-1 with only a minute left when substitute Fred spared their blushes. Jadson replaced Robinho in the starting line up as Brazil coach Mano Menezes rung the changes after the disappointing performance against Venezuela. The Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder repaid that confidence with a fine strike six minutes before halftime in the Mario Kempes stadium. But Paraguay, themselves held by Ecuador in their opener, leveled 11 minutes into the second half through Blackburn striker Roque Santa Cruz. Paraguay then took a shock lead with Dani Alvez losing the ball to Santa Cruz, who found Haedo Valdez. He scored with a deflected shot and a real upset looked on the cards. But Menezes replaced Neymar with Fred and he struck at the death to grab a point for the favorites. The start of the 12-team tournament has been marked by sub-par displays from hosts Argentina and Brazil, with both still looking for a victory after two games apiece. The top two teams from each of three groups of four qualify for the quarterfinals with the two third-placed teams with the best record.

"(CNN) -- Mexican federal police rescued 51 migrant hostages who were being held in northeastern Mexico, the country's public security ministry said Tuesday. The hostages were found Monday inside a house in the city of Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas. The operation followed the rescue of 68 hostages the previous week, also in Reynosa. The city is about 90 miles north of the town of San Fernando, where authorities recently uncovered 177 bodies from mass graves. Many of the bodies are believed to be those of bus passengers who were kidnapped. San Fernando is also where the bodies of 72 migrants were found last year. Among the rescued people this week, police identified 27 Mexicans, 14 Guatemalans, two Hondurans, two Salvadorans and six Chinese. Two people were arrested in connection with the earlier rescue, but no one was taken into custody for Monday's discovery. The state of Tamaulipas, where Reynosa and San Fernando are located, is the site of a bloody battle between rival drug cartels. The Gulf cartel and Zetas cartel used to work together, but split more than a year ago and are now fighting for control of lucrative smuggling routes into the United States.","Federal police rescued 51 hostages in Reynosa, Mexico .

"(CNN) -- A hacker publicly posted Wednesday the home addresses and other information of all 102 police officers with San Francisco's Bay Area Transit system, the second hacking incident against one of its websites since Sunday, a spokesman said. The website for the BART Police Officers Association was broken into Wednesday morning, and the names and phone numbers of its entire membership were also posted publicly on the Internet, BART spokesman James K. Allison said. The officers association, or union, took down their website after the hacking incident, Allison said. It wasn't clear Wednesday who was to blame for the latest hacking incident. In the prior hacking incident on Sunday, members of the well-known hacking group Anonymous took credit in online messages for breaking into a link off BART's website, and information from BART's internal network was posted, including phone numbers of hundreds of people. BART has been at the center of controversy about shootings by its officers, the latest being last month that resulted in the death of Charles Hill, 45. BART officials denounced Wednesday's hacking. ""We condemn this latest attack on the working men and women of BART,"" interim general manager Sherwood Wakeman said in a statement. ""We are deeply concerned about the safety and security of our employees and their families. We stand behind them and our customers who were the subject of an earlier attack. We are deeply troubled by these actions."" Meanwhile, protestors are planning to hold demonstrations next Monday at BART's Civic Center subway station, and transit system officials are planning to beef up security, Allison said. ""We're getting prepared to keep our customers safe as always,"" Allison told CNN. Last Thursday, protestors tried to organize a public demonstration, but BART officials cut off cell phone signals at some subway stations ""as one of many tactics to ensure the safety of everyone on the platform,"" officials said. But the decision to cut cell service was criticized by civil liberty organizations, the San Francisco Chronicle's editorial page and others. The August 11 protests never materialized. After the transit system's shut down cell phone signals, Anonymous threatened in a news release and related Twitter pages that it would make a cyberattack Sunday on the BART website. Then, on Monday night, BART officials temporarily opened and closed downtown subway stations to stem the threat of spreading protests, with police officers in riot gear standing at the Civic Center station. Only small groups of protestors gathered on the streets to criticize BART and its officers' shooting incidents.","A hacker posts personal info of all 102 BART police officers .

"(CNN) -- Two-time Cincinnati champion Andy Roddick is out of the Western and Southern Open after a 6-7 (7-5) 7-5 6-1 first-round defeat to Philipp Kohlschreiber. Roddick, seeded ninth for the hard court tournament, was one set and a break of serve up on his German opponent, but double faults from the American at decisive moments handed momentum to world number 47 Kohlschreiber. It got worse for 2003 U.S. Open winner Roddick in the final set, when he was handed a point penalty for hitting the ball into the stands at the Lindner Family Tennis Center having previously smashed his racquet. ""For two sets tonight I actually hit the ball well considering,"" Roddick, 28, told the ATP Tour's official web site. ""I hit the ball a lot better than I thought I would, if I'm being totally candid. ""I probably will wake up tomorrow morning feeling a little bit better about where I'm at than I did when I woke up this morning.""

"(Mashable)  -- Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss must accept their $65 million settlement from Facebook and move on. A U.S. appeals court ruled Monday that the settlement -- which was featured in the movie ""The Social Network"" -- still stands, despite the Winklevosses' claim that Facebook did not disclose an accurate valuation. The suit stems from the Winklevosses' claim that Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for the social-networking site. Zuckerberg and Facebook deny the allegations, but agreed to settle in 2008. Since then, the Winklevoss twins have attempted to secure a higher settlement by claiming that Facebook is guilty of securities fraud. ""The Winklevosses are not the first parties bested by a competitor who then seek to gain through litigation what they were unable to achieve in the marketplace,"" Chief Judge Alex Kozinski wrote in today's ruling. ""And the courts might have obliged, had the Winklevosses not settled their dispute and signed a release of all claims against Facebook."" With both the district court and appeals court in agreement, it seems this may be the end of the Winklevosses' claim to any additional shares of Facebook. ""For whatever reason, they (the Winklevosses) now want to back out. Like the district court, we see no basis for allowing them to do so,"" Kozinski wrote.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Some of the tens of thousands of refugees who fled to China to escape fighting in Myanmar are beginning to return home as tensions have eased, police said. Refugees from Myanmar sit with their possessions at a camp in Zhenkang, in southwest China, on Sunday. An estimated 37,000 people were displaced by the fighting, Meng Sutie, police chief in southern China's Yunnan Province, told China's state-run Xinhua news agency Sunday. The exodus of residents along the border grew to a flood last week as Myanmar government troops battled ethnic minority groups and their armies in the country's northeast. The region has an estimated population of 150,000. There were casualties on both sides of the border, according to Meng. Shells fired into Chinese territory killed one person and injured two others, while fighting in Myanmar killed a Chinese and wounded 13 more. In a rare criticism of Myanmar's ruling military junta, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said Friday that China hoped Myanmar could properly solve its domestic issues and safeguard the stability of its border with China, Xinhua reported. China has been providing emergency shelter, food and medical care for the refugees.","Some refugees from Myanmar returning home from China's Yunnan province .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's embattled president has been huddling with members of his ruling party in neighboring Saudi Arabia as world and regional powers press for an end to the political crisis in his country and a smooth transition of political power. Ali Abdullah Saleh met on Wednesday with officials and leaders of his ruling General People's Congress party, the state-run news agency SABA and a high-level party official said . This comes amid ""Immense pressure from the international community"" to accept an agreement for a transition of power, the official told CNN. The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, a group of Gulf Arab states, has come up with a plan to ease Saleh out of office, a move that would placate widespread anti-government sentiment in the impoverished Arab nation. The official said Salehwants to make sure he consults senior party officials before he would sign a power transfer deal. Saleh and other top Yemeni officials were badly injured in June during an assassination attempt on the presidential palace amid a tribal revolt against his 32-year rule. Saleh was taken to Saudi Arabia for treatment. SABA reported on Thursday that the party officials congratulated Saleh and others for their recovery and on the advent of the holy month of Ramadan. The president and the others reviewed conditions in Saudi Arabia and touched on the Security Council statement, SABA reported. Saleh underscored the GPC's commitment for ways to solve disagreements with the opposition. ""He underlined the significance of keeping on the positive dealing with the Gulf initiative and to look for the appropriate mechanism to be carried out and to ensure peaceful and smooth transfer of power in accordance with the constitution,"" SABA said. Yemen has endured months of protests and militant violence. Protests against Saleh began in January after the successful uprising in Tunisia triggered regionwide reform movements. The protests led to open street battles after Saleh balked at the political transition deal. At the same time, the government has also faced off with Islamic militants, including the al Qaeda wing in Yemen, regarded by analysts as a potent and dangerous group. Saleh had been discharged from a military hospital, but it was not clear when he would return to Yemen. Saleh's vice president, Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, has been running the government since then.","Saleh met with party officials in Saudi Arabia, where he was treated for wounds .

"(CNN) -- The radio was going on about the space shuttle's last mission. I've never been a space person, but there was still something sad about it. America losing its step. No more space for us. Shuttle launches were like America's homeroom. The whole country checked in. The whole business left me feeling wistful as my friend and I hurtled along in our own white craft drawing a line across the desert from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. A quarter of the way there: Tyvek flapping like flags in the wind. Half-built houses mark the edge of L.A. Metro. The high-water mark of the building boom. Halfway there: We stop in Barstow for cheeseburgers and Cokes. And then it was back into the Mojave Desert. Mountains the color of cocoa sticking up from the earth. The sun a French fry lamp on the side of my face. Guilt from leaving work early tugged on me like the air conditioner dragged on the car engine. Escape to Las Vegas. ""Lost Wages"" my father used to call it. A pun pointed at the town's gambling industry that now just as easily applies to its entire economy. The great recession walloped Vegas harder than most places. It was a subprime boomtown that is now the foreclosure capital of America. What's Vegas like in a down economy? Are there a few more sips left in the champagne bottle? Yes. But it's flat. When we arrived on the Las Vegas Strip, storm clouds were gathered around the Statue of Liberty replica. A double take confirmed that they were real. Rain in the desert, what were the odds? A rhetorical question in any city but this one. The Strip. America's Id. Visiting there is like stepping into mainstream television: common-denominator vulgarity that you can't keep your eyes off of. ""Pleasure"" pumped into elephantine proportions. Like a basket containing the world's largest gourd held by a woman with the world's largest breasts. Don't get me wrong, I like sex, gambling and tippling, but its hyper-commercialization brings me down. Like how passing a blown-up picture of a chili dog on a semi ruins your appetite instead of whetting it. In the belly of the MGM Grand parking lot we unload our bags. Parents walk by holding children. Slightly older children walk by holding suitcases of beer. Everyone tingles with anticipation. There is an optimism inherent in a clean hotel room at the beginning of a weekend. This will be my headquarters. I will hang my clothes here. This will be my desk. Las Vegas hotel stays carry an additional air of mischief. We'll drink here before we go out. I will close the curtains so the sun doesn't come in tomorrow. I'll choose this bed because it's closer to the door and God knows when I'm coming back. We decided to walk over to the recently renovated Tropicana hotel and casino. In the postmodern Epcot Center that is Las Vegas, the Tropicana is Miami's South Beach. The building's handsome white gleam and jaunty retro sign held the promise of an excellent martini, and soon I was behind one the size of an office trash can. We were the only people at the bar; 7 p.m. is a dead zone in summertime Vegas. All day long people attend pool parties. And then late at night they attend clubs. From 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. is reserved for showers, TV and energy drinks. Our booby prize was a video screen behind the bar showing an endlessly looping video of, well, boobs, and other body parts wrapped up in bathing suits and gyrating to music. Like songs that tell you how to dance, the decorations in Las Vegas are constantly showing you how you are supposed to behave. Later, while eating hamburgers at Hubert Keller's ""Burger Bar,"" we are surrounded by picture of hamburgers -- hamburgers that look much juicier and more appetizing than the ones we were eating. Hours of blackjack. In my back pocket I had a set of tips my father sent me. Don't hit if the dealer has 3-6 and you have a bustable hand. If you're dealt two aces always split them and then pray for tens, etc. I withdrew $300 from the ATM and watched my pile go up and down for hours. Up. Down. Up. Down. I toggled from scotch to seltzer. Scotch. Seltzer. The dealers rotated. The fast one who prefers the ladies. The deliberate one who wordlessly guides the players. The efficient, emotionless machine who just deals, deals, deals. And then there was the ever-changing cast of players. The fat drunk tanktopper smoking a cigarette filter. Two Irish kids with gelled sea anemone hair. The chubby secretary who would scratch the table with her pink-painted fingernail every time she wanted a hit. And at one point in the night, superstar singer Michael Buble and his Argentine underwear-model wife sidle up to the table and do well until a crowd of squealing girls forms and he is forced to cash out. It's 3:30. Walk back to the room. A fight breaks out behind me. A girl lies legs-splayed on a flower planter in the lobby. A couple ruts next to the soda machine. A man lies face down in his own vomit. Prostitutes roam the floor looking for drunk prey. A topless guy smokes a cigarette in my elevator. As the door shuts and the elevator lifts, I can still hear the bingbinging clamor of America spending its energy-drink money on Texas hold 'em. In the morning it's dim sum on Spring Mountain Road, Vegas' version of Chinatown. Yes, the city has the skyline of New York and Paris, the canals of Venice and the pools of South Beach, but the real spin around the world happens in the neighborhoods that surround the Strip. About 22% of Las Vegans are immigrants who were attracted by the low cost of living and the abundance of service jobs that don't require a higher education. The city's strip malls are an international food court. Eritrean and Chinese food. Mexican and Thai. We meet cabbies from Burma, Ethiopia, and the Philippines. This global village aspect of Vegas is one of the most exhilarating parts of the area and could be a draw unto itself. They could call it ""American Census 2050."" From Vegas' future to its past: Downtown. The city's soul. Iconic Vegas. Neon and $9 prime rib specials. The home of old guard Vegas -- Binion's, the Gold Spike and the Golden Nugget. There are $5 blackjack tables here and strawberry daiquiris with whipped cream. To draw some of the action back from the Strip, businesses chipped in and created the Fremont Street Experience, a barrel vault canopy 90 feet high and four blocks long. It shelters folks from the sun in the day and turns into a light show at night. People rappel under the canopy. Buskers perform there. Concerts play. It's livened up the area, but it's what hasn't been done to the neighborhood that's going to save it: The old gambling houses in this neighborhood just feel right. An old piece of America that has hung on. A symbol that there is life after a bubble. The next day we leave the greatest example of American excess and visit the greatest example of American restraint: Hoover Dam. There are only 3,485 days and counting of water left in Las Vegas, literally. The canyon surrounding Hoover Dam is the evidence. Its walls are chalk white where the water line used to be. You have to move your head forward toward your belly to see where the water line is now. I piss in one of the magnificent marble art deco restrooms that sit on top of the dam. The windows there provide a dramatic view of this modern wonder of the world. Nowhere in America today is a bathroom being built like this, nor will one be built in the near future. Unless, maybe, someone decides to open up a resort on the strip called ""America Then."" They could buy a mothballed space shuttle and hang it in the lobby.","Brendan Francis Newnam takes road trip to ""Lost Wages""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- In some countries, the written word brings more than just readers to those bold enough to publish. Local journalists who attach their names to scrutinizing articles in Afghanistan are often subject to threats of kidnapping, acid attacks and death -- especially if the writer is a woman. That's the daily reality for Afghan journalist Farida Nekzad, who says she's been threatened by extremist groups warning her against publishing articles that cast a critical lens on local customs and national politics. ""You have to fight everyday,"" said the former managing editor of the Pajhwok News Agency, the country's largest local provider of independent news. ""You have to accept the risk, and that's why we face such challenges."" The once fledgling news agency began as a small project in 2003, and later flourished into a nation-wide network of correspondents with eight bureaus and an average output of three dozen stories per day, according to its website. Nekzad began as a journalist there, also having worked as a radio reporter. Earning her stripes covering the local effects of the U.S.-led war and her country in transition, she took over as managing editor and began training a corps of budding young journalists. Many of them were women. ""Everyone needs information, particularly women need to know and have information for their awareness,"" she told CNN. ""I think one of the ways we can do something is by starting with this profession."" But after years of receiving threatening e-mails and phone calls, the prospect of violence became reality when a bomb detonated on the driveway of her home. ""I was displaced from my home for nine to about 10 months,"" forced to leave because her neighbors complained. They said ""you have to leave your building,"" according to Nekzad. Leaving Pajhwok in 2009 in an effort to lower her profile, the longtime journalist says she sought to avoid the limelight that had brought extremists to her door. ""The threats and warnings scared me,"" said Nekzad, who at the time was pregnant with her daughter, Muska. But she had also laid the ground-work for what would become her next venture, working alongside her husband to set up a separate news agency called ""Wakht,"" meaning ""Time."" Today, Nekzad is the agency's director, overseeing a staff of more than two dozen journalists who cover Afghanistan's forbidding terrain in an effort to root out stories in all of its 34 provinces. And again, many of her reporters are women. ""She typifies the double jeopardy under which women journalists in Afghanistan are forced to operate,"" said Bob Dietz, Committee to Protect Journalists Asia Program Coordinator. ""Reporting and editing and running a news operation is tough enough there, but doing it as a woman makes it much more of a challenge."" Even after the ouster of the Taliban from Kabul in 2001, social and cultural restrictions against women in Afghanistan have remained heavy-handed. Despite the adoption of a constitution that greatly expands women's legal rights, most women are never taught to read. About 14% of Afghan women are currently literate, according to a statement from the Ministry of Education. They ""are uneducated and away from education,"" said Nekzad. ""Women need for women to share their experiences, share their problems and share their challenges of how they suffer."" But with Internet access restricted and its penetration especially low in rural areas, online news agencies -- like Wakht -- struggle to deliver information beyond the country's few metropolitan areas. Still, there are signs afoot of a quietly developing women's rights movement. Last week, a handful of women -- mostly Kabul residents -- marched in the capital streets, carrying placards in protest of male harassment. And yet with NATO in the process of a drawn-down, handing over the first seven designated areas to Afghan Security Forces, many fear the effects of a resurgent Taliban or a negotiated settlement that allows militants to come back. ""This is really a very critical question,"" said Nekzad. ""The biggest problem is that there is no guarantee (for women's safety)."" The veteran journalist said that while she supports negotiations that could lead to peace, she questioned ""who will guarantee that the Taliban...will agree that women should be a part of the activity and a part of the society to work?"" Although the troubles of Afghan women were there prior to the Taliban's arrival in the mid-90s, the hard-line group has traditionally taken a tough stance against them. ""When the Taliban first entered Kabul, the religious police beat men and women in public for not having long enough beards or not wearing the burka properly,"" wrote Pakistani author Ahmed Rashid in his widely-acclaimed book ""Taliban."" Still, the costs of the near decade-long conflict seems to appeal less and less to the war-weary public of Europe and the United States, whose electorates are still reeling from the aftermath of recession. Last month, nearly three-quarters of Americans polled said they support the United States pulling out some or all of its forces out of the country. How those factors will affect international resolve to promote local institutions and bring about lasting security in Afghanistan is still unclear.","Afghan journalist Farida Nekzad says she's been threatened by extremist groups .

"(CNN) -- Syrian tanks stormed the flashpoint city of Hama Sunday in one of several clashes that rights groups said left more than 70 people dead and more than 100 injured nationwide. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported that at least 71 people were killed across the country, with at least 50 killed in Hama. Other human rights organizations offered different assessments of the situation, with some reporting that more than 100 people died in the city of Hama alone. A doctor in Hama said that more than 100 people were killed in the city and its surrounding areas. ""I feel terrible. I am exhausted, psychologically exhausted, the pain. I can't imagine a brother is killing his brother. And what for? For the president? It's terrible here. We see a lot of this blood and things -- 115 dead -- it's too much for one day,"" he said. CNN was unable to independently confirm the death tolls. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said security forces were responding to ""armed groups"" in Hama who blocked streets with barricades and terrorized citizens by firing from the rooftops of buildings, while human rights groups described the arrival of tanks as a raid on the city. Three members of security forces were killed in clashes in Hama and three members of the military were killed in Deir Ezzour, SANA said. The government-run agency said ""armed terrorist groups"" had taken to the streets in Deir Ezzour, attacking police headquarters and stealing weapons. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an affiliation of groups that reports on protests in the nation, reported at least 11 people were killed in Deir Ezzour. In Hama, throngs of residents took to the streets in an attempt to block the tanks, a local activist said. More than 100 were injured in the city, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria. One Hama resident told CNN he was awakened at 4 a.m. by the sounds of bombs, machine guns and yelling. He said hospitals have begun calling people to come donate blood, but security forces have blocked the roads so people cannot reach the hospital. ""Security forces and army tanks, whenever they see a car moving, they start shooting at the car,"" he said. ""I'm talking to you from the streets. I have my knife,"" he said. The man said he and his neighbors are trying to protect the neighborhood, using only sticks, swords and knives. ""People are not scared here any more,"" he said. ""What's the worst? The army and security people are already killing people. We are not scared of death at all. We are willing to pay anything -- our souls, anything -- just to get our freedom."" Tanks rolling near the border met fierce resistance from residents, said Omar al Habbal, a member of the committees. ""Hama will be very harsh to them,"" said al Habbal, who lives in the city. ""The whole city has decided to resist with stones, not weapons. The army will either join the demonstrators or leave our city."" Gunfire rang through the air for hours, and thick black smoke covered areas where residents reported shelling and civilian casualties, al Habbal said. ""Mosques have been broadcasting repeated chants of 'Allah Akbar' all morning, and everybody is in the street chanting, 'The people and the army are one hand,' "" al Habbal said. Local residents reported negotiating with the troops, with protesters standing up on the tanks and cheering, ""Syria is united!"" CNN could not independently verify the accuracy of the reports. The raid marks the latest violence as anti-government protesters in the nation have called for a new regime since mid-March. Activists blame the deaths of civilians in demonstrations on security forces, but the government has consistently attributed the violence to ""armed groups."" President Bashar al-Assad has drawn criticism at home and abroad for his tough crackdown on the protesters calling for his ouster. A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Sunday the United Nations chief was ""deeply concerned"" about reports of hundreds of protesters killed and injured. ""He strongly condemns the use of force against the civilian population and calls on the government of Syria to halt this violent offensive at once,"" the spokesman said in a statement, referring to Ban. U.S. President Barack Obama said he was ""appalled"" and pledged that U.S. officials will increase pressure on the Syrian regime, ""isolate the Assad government and stand with the Syrian people."" ""The reports out of Hama are horrifying and demonstrate the true character of the Syrian regime,"" Obama said in a statement. British Foreign Secretary William Hague also condemned the reported attacks. ""The attack appears to be part of a coordinated effort across a number of towns in Syria to deter the Syrian people from protesting in advance of Ramadan. The attacks are all the more shocking on the eve of the Muslim holy month,"" he said in a statement. ""President Bashar is mistaken if he believes that oppression and military force will end the crisis in his country. He should stop this assault on his own people now."" Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch said government forces targeted the city. ""Hama is the latest city to fall victim to President Bashar al-Assad's security forces despite his promises that his government would tolerate peaceful protests,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""Security forces have responded to protests with the brutality that's become familiar over the past several months."" The humanitarian watchdog said earlier this month that the forces raided homes, opened fire and set up checkpoints in and around the restive city, the site of a deadly military clampdown nearly 30 years ago. CNN's Arwa Damon, Rima Maktabi and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","NEW: A doctor in Hama says more than 100 people were killed in and around the city .

"Dolo, Somalia (CNN) -- The World Bank has pledged more than $500 million for famine victims in Somalia as the United Nations met in emergency session Monday to address the aid response in Somalia, the hardest-hit nation in the region. ""Immediate relief and recovery is the first priority, and it is important to act fast to reduce human suffering,"" World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick said in a news release. Also Monday, representatives of 191 member countries of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization met in Rome to devise a plan to head off the imminent food crisis, which the UN has said is affecting more than 12 million people. Two regions in southern Somalia are suffering famine. ""World leaders have no excuses for not generously responding,"" Oxfam Chief Executive Barbara Stocking said in a statement. ""This should not be happening. It is a colossal outrage that the warnings went unheeded, that the lessons of previous famines have been ignored. Yes, we need to save lives today, but we also need to ensure that people have a future. Above all, we need to build a global food system that allows everyone enough to eat."" But such efforts will take time to translate into aid on the ground for the many people in Somalia whose needs are immediate. In Dolo, across the border from Ethiopia, World Food Program workers were registering women and children Monday in a rocky square in this dusty town dotted with thorn bushes. In a visit Monday by CNN, no one appeared to be receiving aid, and no one was receiving medical help -- they were just getting registered. Aid officials said they hoped to get food to areas in need in the coming days. They said that some people who had fled across the border into neighboring Ethiopia or Kenya were returning after hearing that distribution was set to begin soon. At a second registration point nearby, neat lines of women, their children and grandchildren also waited to get registered. Mixed with the town's residents were people who had fled from other parts of the country in search of aid. Children were drinking water from an oil drum perched atop a donkey. CNN's journalists reached the town by driving in a convoy protected by armed militia members aligned with the government. The militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab, which has sworn allegiance to al Qaeda and is designated a terrorist group by the United States, is less than 50 miles away and could easily move into this area if they wished, according to UN security officials on the scene. Al-Shabaab has reversed a pledge to allow foreign aid agencies to operate in famine-struck regions in the nation. The group originally banned the aid agencies from areas under its control in 2009, describing them as Western spies and Christian crusaders. ""We are building up in Mogadishu, where we are reaching up to 300,000 people,"" Josette Sheeran, executive director of the World Food Program, said about the violence-ravaged capital. ""But the World Food Program has lost 14 people since 2008, just trying to get kids food. It's dangerous, and it's risky, and we are committed to going to where the people need the most."" The World Food Program has airlifted supplies to Dolo, which borders Ethiopia. ""One thing that is important is to get the supplementary nutritional foods to these children, because children get very weak quickly on these treks,"" Sheeran said. The International Committee of the Red Cross said operating in the nation is a challenge. ""We have teams deployed throughout the country,"" said Yves van Loo, a spokesman for the Red Cross. ""Logistically, it is very complex to operate in Somalia."" More funds are needed to expand aid, the spokesman said. ""We are covering most of the most vulnerable people in the areas we reach, but more needs to be done,"" he said. ""If we can get more money, we can do it."" He said the ICRC was continuing to operate throughout Somalia, as it has for the past 20 years, without encountering problems with Al-Shabaab. ""We are deployed in all provinces, while most of the organizations have just a few spots,"" he said. The World Bank announced Monday that it is providing more than $500 million to assist drought victims and $12 million in immediate aid to the hardest-hit areas. The drought has led to starvation and the loss of crops and livestock. Food prices have nearly tripled in some areas since last year, worsening the crisis. The funds will go toward battling the worst drought in 60 years in Horn of African nations, including Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, the World Bank said. The pledge comes as international aid groups warned that most Somalis have no access to food, and failure to reach them puts children most at risk as their parents trek for days in search of help. ""Women have been telling us throughout the area that they've had to leave children along the road who can't make it, who are too weak to make it and have died along the way,"" Sheeran said. As the crisis escalates, relief agencies are scrambling to find ways to deliver supplements to areas that are hardest-hit. About 60% of the Somali population is not getting aid, Sheeran said. Aid groups are hoping to reach Somalis in the country before they flee to overcrowded camps in Kenya and Ethiopia for help. ""When children have to move long distances, their bodies deteriorate very quickly,"" Sheeran said. ""For children under 5 years old, their bodies and brains can't grow normally."" CNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","NEW: In Dolo, people are getting registered but the aid had not yet arrived .

"(CNN) -- For 45 years, Jerry Lewis and the Muscular Dystrophy Association's annual Labor Day fundraiser have been synonymous, so much so that it's now known as the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon, in honor of the comic's tireless efforts. But this September, the 85-year-old star will don his tuxedo to entertain the masses and help ""Jerry's Kids"" for the last time, the charity announced Monday. ""As a labor of love, I've hosted the annual telethon since 1966,"" Lewis said in news release issued by the Muscular Dystrophy Association. ""And I'll be making my final appearance on the show this year, by performing my signature song, 'You'll Never Walk Alone.' "" Lewis hit it big at age 20 in 1946, teaming up with Dean Martin to become one of the most popular comedy partnerships in history. Together, they headlined thousands of sold-out performances, 16 hit movies and two dozen top-rated television shows. After the break-up of the Martin and Lewis team, Lewis made a successful solo career. In 1959, he signed a seven-year, $10 million contract with Paramount -- at the time, the largest contract ever between a studio and performer. His solo film career included classics such as ""The Nutty Professor,"" ""The Bellboy"" and ""The Geisha Boy."" Still, for several generations since, Lewis has been known as much as a philanthropist as a movie star. That's because of his work with the Muscular Dystrophy Association, a nonprofit dedicated to curing that disease, ALS and related ailments as well as providing support, education and other services. Lewis joined the cause in the early 1950s, and he gave it star power in 1966 when he became the host of what would be the charity's first of many telethons over Labor Day weekends. In between occasional songs, comic bits and passionate pitches for people to donate, his biggest challenge was keeping the variety show lively and engaging for as long as 21.5 hours straight. Scores of television stations across the country picked up the program, while volunteers stood by to take calls from people pledging donations. The 2010 edition, for instanced, raised $58,919,838 after performances by the likes of acrobatic dancers from Cirque du Soleil, ""American Idol's"" David Archuleta and a host of comedic performers. Still, throughout the plethora of acts, the one constant over 900 hours of programming has remained Lewis. This year's event, on September 4, will be shorter than many of years past at six hours. Still Lewis promised that it ""will be spectacular, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it."" Even as he steps down as host, Lewis said he will continue to serve as national chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association. The group's president, Gerald Weinberg, thanked the comic for remaining committed to the cause, as well as for his efforts over the years. ""All of us who've been privileged to work beside him, and the hundreds of thousands throughout the world affected by the myriad of muscle diseases MDA battles, will acknowledge in our hearts forever the unrivaled role Jerry has played in our lives and the lives of all Americans,"" Weinberg said in the news release.","Jerry Lewis has co-hosted the MDA's annual telethon since 1966 .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic has told CNN he expects Chelsea and Manchester City to challenge for English Premier League honors. Vidic, 29, led Alex Ferguson's team to a record 19th English league title last season, and the Serbia defender is confident United can keep the Premier League trophy at Old Trafford if they make a strong start to the campaign. ""I would say Chelsea is always there because of experience,"" said Vidic when asked who the Red Devils' main rivals would be. ""They have players who have been playing a few years together, and they know each other very well. And they will be hungry to win the title yet again. Big kick-off: Who will win Europe's top leagues? ""City, they have a made few signings, I think they will be even stronger this year, especially because they play one year together. I think they will be our bigger rivals."" Vidic has won a host of honors since arriving in Manchester from Spartak Moscow in 2006, including four English titles and the European Champions League in 2008. Despite this success, the former Red Star Belgrade center-back said he is still hungry to win and he is eyeing an FA Cup triumph to complete his collection of English winner's medals. ""If you want to play for Manchester United you have to win everything,"" he said. ""You have to be successful, otherwise, new players come and you have to fight for your place. I still have hunger to play, hunger to win the trophies, and I'm really happy. ""I would really like to win the FA Cup as well. I haven't won the FA Cup yet, this is the trophy I really want to win."" Since signing for United, Vidic has been under the guidance of the club's long-serving manager Alex Ferguson. The veteran Scot has forged a reputation as one of the game's top coaches during his 25 years with the club, winning 12-top flight championships, five FA Cups and twice leading United to Champions League glory. ""I have to say what he brings to the club is stability,"" Vidic said of Ferguson. ""He builds a road which all players follow. ""This is a great thing. At other clubs you have the problems in terms of the change of the coaches; they are changing new players and coaches. Sometimes they really have the problem, to build the team."" Vidic will lead his United teammates out for their first Premier League match of the season against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns on Sunday.","Nemanja Vidic highlights Chelsea and Manchester City as United's title rivals .

"(CNN) -- Alaska election officials will begin counting write-in ballots Wednesday despite a federal court challenge by the campaign of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joe Miller, state director Gail Fenumiai said. The complaint filed in federal court Tuesday afternoon asks Fenumiai's office to ""adhere"" to state law in the counting of write-in ballots, limiting what the suit called ""subjective"" voter intent rules that were issued this week. Miller's campaign has blasted the Division of Elections' standards as ""extraordinarily ambiguous."" The suit requests a court hearing Wednesday over the rules and asks for an injunction. The guidelines say poll workers must consider the voter's intent when determining whether to count a ballot for a write-in candidate. The Miller suit says, according to state election law, that a write-in vote can't be accepted if the voter did not correctly write either the full name or last name of a candidate; the voter wrote a candidate's name incorrectly, or misspelled it; or the name written on the ballot is not the name used on the candidate's certificate of candidacy. ""The Miller Campaign has consistently maintained that every valid, lawful vote should be counted,"" campaign attorney Ton Van Flein said in a statement. ""We have further held to the expectation that the state laws, as written, should be followed, and that they should not be changed now, after the votes have been cast. ""Yesterday, the state issued a new policy -- after the votes have been cast -- imposing a new election standard for write-in ballots,"" he continued. ""We believe this action to be unconstitutional and contrary to express legislative mandates."" Miller is believed to be locked in a tight race with incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who ran as a write-in candidate. In last week's election, Miller received 34 percent of the vote, Democrat Scott McAdams, who conceded, collected 24 percent and 41 percent of ballots were for write-in candidates. Based on pre-election polling, the vast majority of write-in votes are expected to go to Murkowski, who lost to Miller in the Republican primary. Murkowski, however, was one of 161 eligible write-in candidates, giving Miller hope that he might still win. He currently has about 13,000 fewer votes than the write-in total. ""It is clear the Miller campaign wants to exclude as many votes from being counted as possible,"" Murkowski campaign manager Kevin Sweeney said early Wednesday. Murkowski said she intends to caucus with the Republicans should she return to the Senate. ""I'm not my party's nominee, but I am a Republican,"" she said. With a victory, Murkowski would avenge her August primary loss to Miller in the latest chapter of a feud with his main backers and her long-standing tension with former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who backed Miller. Murkowski was first appointed to her post by her father, then-Gov. Frank Murkowski, in 2002. Palin defeated him in the 2006 GOP gubernatorial primary.

"(CNN) -- An Arkansas court has called a short-notice hearing Friday for three men convicted of killing three West Memphis boys in 1993, with authorities tight-lipped about the nature of the proceeding in a closely watched case. All three of the men -- Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley Jr. and Jason Baldwin, dubbed the ""West Memphis Three"" -- are expected to attend the session in Jonesboro. The state attorney general's office said it could not comment on the matter, citing a gag order on participants in the case. Stephanie Harris, a spokeswoman for the state court system, said the convicts would appear before a judge in chambers before the public hearing is held. Echols was sentenced to death and Misskelley and Baldwin were given life sentences in the May 1993 slayings of second-graders Steven Branch, Michael Moore and Christopher Byers. The boys' bodies were mutilated and left in a ditch, hogtied with their own shoelaces. Prosecutors argued that Echols, Misskelley and Baldwin, then teenagers, were driven by satanic ritual and that Echols had been the ringleader. But DNA testing that was not available at the time failed to link any of the men to the crime, and the state Supreme Court ruled in November that all three could present new evidence to the trial court in an effort to clear them. The case has drawn national attention, with actor Johnny Depp and singer Eddie Vedder trying to rally support for the men's release. CNN's Nick Valencia and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","A new hearing for the ""West Memphis Three"" is set for Friday .

"New York (CNN) -- A day after state lawmakers were due to head home, a pair of controversial issues seem to stubbornly postpone their summer recess. The first is something that many call a quintessential New York battle: Whether to enact the first statewide cap on property taxes. The cap is linked to the extension of rent control laws that apply to roughly 1 million apartments, most of them in New York City. The second is the subject of national debate: Should New York become the sixth state in the union to adopt same-sex marriage laws? Monday was technically the last official day of the legislative session, but the votes are still pending. On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos said lawmakers had reached a ""framework for an agreement"" on the rent and tax issues, but acknowledged that same-same sex marriage was not a part of those deliberations. The Senate has struggled to bring to the floor a bill that would legalize the unions, but separate talks continued Tuesday, according to a spokesman for Skelos. A vote on the measure, which the state Assembly passed Wednesday night, has been stalled in part by Republican concerns over protections for religious institutions against the potential for litigation in the wake of the proposed law. Republicans, led by Skelos, have expressed concerns over the ""unintended consequences"" of a bill that redefines the legal parameters of marriage. On Monday, hundreds of demonstrators filled the state Capitol in Albany in anticipation of the vote, chanting slogans and wielding signs for and against the controversial measure. At last public count, 31 senators, including two Republicans, were in favor of the bill. Its backers need one more GOP member to vote in favor for it to pass. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who proposed the bill, says it would grant same-sex couples equal rights to marry ""as well as hundreds of rights, benefits and protections that are currently limited to married couples of the opposite sex."" The first-term governor has lobbied opposition and undecided senators in an effort to secure the lone vote needed for the bill's passage. Meanwhile, Greg Ball -- one of several Republican senators who are considered on the fence over the pending vote -- reiterated his party's concerns about the legislation's potential impact on religious institutions. ""I'm not going to vote for a bill where Catholic adoption agencies or religious organizations are shut down or are opened up to lawsuits,"" he said Friday, noting that adoption agencies were closed after same-sex marriage laws were adopted in other states. He declined to elaborate. Democrat Tom Duane, an openly gay member of the state Senate, countered Friday that there are ""already laws on the books in New York state which protect people of faith."" ""Marriage is a civil right. People get married, and it is recognized in government,"" he said. ""We're talking about the government recognizing same-sex equality."" But the passage of same-sex marriage laws faces a daunting history in the New York state legislature. The Senate rejected a bill to legalize same-sex marriage in 2009 and has blocked the last three attempts by the state's lower house to get the proposed legislation signed into law. Although New York currently does not grant same-sex marriages, a 2008 appellate court ruling upheld the right of couples to have their same-sex marriages recognized if they are performed elsewhere. The current measure would amend the state's Domestic Relations Law to say, among other changes, that ""no application for a marriage license shall be denied on the ground that the parties are of the same or a different sex."" Five states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont and New Hampshire -- and the District of Columbia currently grant same-sex marriage licenses. CNN's Dana Garrett contributed to this report.","Senate leader says lawmakers reach ""framework for ... agreement"" on rent, tax issues .

"(CNN) -- Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska, was closed Thursday night, stranding hundreds of passengers, after being struck by two violent storms packing high winds and massive hail, the airport director said. Omaha Airport Authority Executive Director Steve Coufal said that the airfield had been closed for several hours, with at least one reported injury: a pilot who was taken to a local hospital after being struck by hail. Southwest Airlines spokesperson Ashley Dillon said two of the airline's planes were on the ground -- one of them Flight 751 to Chicago, which was being boarded -- when the first storm hit. The decision was made to deplane the 137 passengers from the Boeing 737, and a male pilot was struck by hail while standing in the jetway. Dillon said he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital. Southwest discontinued its flights for the remainder of the night. Dillon said 13 flights were affected: eight arrivals and five departures. The first storms came through Omaha at about 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET). The airport was subsequently shut down so that airport officials could evaluate damage done to equipment. After about an hour-and-a-half, the airport was reopened, but was closed again minutes later when the second storm came through, packing very strong winds and heavy rains, Coufal said. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said hailstones were reportedly up 2.75 inches in diameter, or approximately baseball-sized. Video footage from local CNN affiliate KPTM seemed to confirm that estimate, as the windshields of several cars in the airport parking lot were either shattered or bore large holes and craters. The airport director said winds of about 100 mph were reported, and visibility was 5-10 feet. Airport officials were inspecting damage and meeting with transportation officials Thursday night to address passengers' needs. Coufal said seven commercial planes received some degree of damage, and parked surface vehicles had extensive damage. Also, the roof, some windows and signage were damaged at the facility. One jet bridge was blown into an aircraft by the winds, according to Coufal. CNN's Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report.","Injured pilot was conscious when taken to the hospital, airline official says .

"New York (CNN) -- If ""Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark"" can rise above devastating reviews and headline-grabbing injuries, much of the credit will go to director Philip William McKinley. McKinley was hired four months ago to salvage the troubled show, which officially opens Tuesday evening. ""Well, they say I'm either the bravest or stupidest man in New York,"" McKinley said. As stuntmen flew overhead before an afternoon matinee preview, McKinley says he took the job in large part because of the commitment of the show's team. ""From what the cast had gone through, I knew they had the dedication, the creativity, the formidability to do it. And that meant a great deal to me,"" he said. McKinley, a Broadway veteran, has the creative experience for the job. When ""Spider-Man 2.0,"" the nickname for the retooled version, opens, it will have gone through millions of dollars in development costs, six delayed openings and a record-setting 180 preview performances. The original concept for ""Spider-Man"" was the vision of Julie Taymor, the Tony Award-winning director of the stage version of The Lion King. She was pushed aside by producers in March, although she reportedly retains some involvement in the show. Musical collaborators are U2 bandmates Bono and the Edge, who wrote the show's music and lyrics, stayed on and added several new songs while rewriting a few others. Also added to the revamped show are an additional five flying sequences and expanded roles for Aunt May, Uncle Ben and love-interest Mary Jane Watson. But despite the changes, many fear the worst for the show financially. Foxwoods Theatre is one of the largest on Broadway. If ""Spider-Man"" is going to be successful, the show will have to fill the seats in the house for years to come. ""The weekly running costs just to pay the actors, the stagehands and all that stuff is $1.3 million,"" said NY Post Theater Critic Michael Riedel. ""Now the show is grossing, according to Variety, over a million dollars a week. But that's just breaking even. They haven't even begun to chip away at the $80 million production costs."" Still, McKinley says audiences seem to love the show. And from the very first preview since the big revamp, the cast has been pumped, he said. ""The magical moment was when the curtain went down, the cast completely lost all their composure, began jumping up and down, began high-fiving each other like at a baseball game or a football game,"" he said. ""They were just cheering. "" ""The song in the show, 'Rise Above,' that's kind of become our motto and kind of become the anthem.""","Getting the production to opening night has cost an estimated $80 million .

"(CNN)  -- Sergio Aguero scored twice on his Manchester City debut as Roberto Mancini's men thrashed Swansea 4-0 in their English Premier League opener Monday. The Argentina international had just come on as a second half substitute when he struck the second for City. Causing havoc in the Swansea defense, Aguero then cleverly set up David Silva for the third. A thumping shot for the fourth rounded off a spectacular first match for Aguero and completed a miserable night for promoted Swansea. Edin Dzeko opened the scoring for the home side just before the hour mark after a goalless first half. The victory takes City joint top with Bolton in the early standings as they attempt to wrest the Premier League title from city rivals Manchester United. Mancini was delighted by Aguero's performance, but warned he will improve. ""I think he needs to recover as he only finished the Copa America three weeks ago,"" he told Sky Sports. ""He needs another two to three weeks to be 100%, maybe. For me he`s a fantastic striker, young, and he`s going to be a fantastic player for us."" The result was a little harsh on Brendan Rogers'  Swansea, who played neat and containing football in the first half, but their goalkeeper Michel Vorm was kept busy and Gareth Barry was denied by the woodwork as the home side pressed. In other English Premier League news Monday, Tottenham striker Robbie Keane is to join David Beckham at Los Angeles Galaxy on a two-year deal. Keane, who is the the 10th-leading goal scorer in the history of the Premier League, has been capped 110 times by the Republic of Ireland. He has fallen out of favor at Tottenham and spent the end of last season on loan at relegated West Ham. ""I am delighted, honored and very excited to be joining the LA Galaxy,"" Keane told their official web site.

"(CNN) -- They recline in their bras and panties, some wearing pearls and Brigitte Bardot-inspired bouffants, shooting smiles at the camera. The images are just like many a lingerie ad designed to entice, but these are images of young girls -- those who aren't even old enough to need bras. French company Jours Après Lunes has designed a line of ""loungerie"" -- a compromise between loungewear and lingerie -- for children between the ages of 4 and 12. A line for teenagers and infants is seemingly age appropriate, but the designs for children are drawing fire. The company's mission is to be ""the first designer brand dedicated to 'loungerie' for children and teenagers, comprised of loungewear and lingerie to be worn over and under, inside and outside."" Fashionista.com first broke the story, stating ""What's disturbing about Jours Après Lunes is not just the fact that it's lingerie for people who probably shouldn't be old enough to even know what lingerie is, but the photographs on their website."" In the comments, readers went back and forth over the appropriateness of the lingerie, asking if these girls were old enough to make decisions about how they want to look and, even more hotly contested, if the styling of the photos sexualizes the lingerie, rather than the designs themselves. In an interview with the Lingerie Trade website, Jours Après Lunes creator Sophie Morin defended her brand and the photographs included in the ad campaign. ""There is no vulgar connotation,"" she said. ""The materials are totally opaque, there is no transparency, no lace. The triangles -- there are only two in the collection -- are used in swimwear for the smallest children and as a first support for young girls, even by young women who are not looking for proper support since the tops I design do not offer any. There is no bra in my collection. ""The children are not wearing heels, nor nail polish, nor lipstick,"" Morin added. ""Their hairstyles are exaggerated, just as are games and the child's universe. These models are professional models and not 'Lolitas' who have stolen women's clothing."" Comments on the Fashionista story show that many who have viewed the ads don't take away the innocent ""child's universe"" that Morin was hoping to convey. The makeup on the models, although it may not include lipstick, was another upsetting factor for viewers, and while Morin says there are no bras in the collection, it was assumed that the ""swimwear tops"" were lingerie-esque in appearance. Morin also said that the loungerie is not distributed in the U.S. or the UK. The criticism of the French clothing line is not unlike when Abercrombie and Fitch released its ""Ashley"" push-up bra, originally designed for 7-year-olds but later marketed to 12-year-old girls after a public outcry. Previously on CNN.com/opinion: Parents, don't dress your girls like tramps . In 2007, the American Psychological Association developed a task force of psychologists to tackle the issue of sexualization of girls in every form of media. Dr. Tomi-Ann Roberts was a part of that task force and continues to address female body image and sexuality. Dr. Roberts and her colleagues on the task force say that sexually objectifying women at a progressively younger age has been occurring for the last 20 years in advertising. The photo spread by Jours Après Lunes came as no surprise to her, although she still considers these ad campaigns to be ""nauseating and sick."" In a society that continues to value younger women, we've reached an ultimate low, Roberts said. This campaign, with its prominently featured stuffed animals, is eerily similar to a recent Victoria's Secret fashion show, where scantily-clad models ""dragged teddy bears down the catwalk,"" she said. And as for the girls involved in the photo shoot, Roberts believes they know how to portray a sexualized look. ""I think the advertising world is trying to convince all of us that youth is the only good time of life,"" Dr. Roberts said. ""Now it's like, we've been obsessed with youth, so we might as well have them be 6 years old. Today's girls equate pretty with 'trumped-up sexy.' ""We have now said, as a society, that attractiveness today is constituted by a pornographied, voyeuristic look-at-me kind of sexuality. Girls know it very well. If I say 'Look pretty' to a young girl, she lowers her chin, slants her eyes and turns to the side. That's everywhere around them. ""What we have taught them by posing them this way that there's something about their bodies that is publicly consumable."" Discussion: Would you buy this kind of lingerie for your young daughter?

"(CNN) -- A leading international children's charity has warned that Elton John's desire to adopt a 14-month-old baby boy could lead to more children being abandoned. Elton John kisses baby Lev during his visit to the orphanage in Ukraine on Saturday. The singer, 62, made the announcement during a visit with his partner, 46-year-old David Furnish, to an orphanage for HIV-affected children in Ukraine on Saturday. ""David always wanted to adopt and I always said no because I am 62 and I think because of the traveling I do and the life I have, maybe it wouldn't be fair for the child,"" he told reporters. ""But having seen Lev today, I would love to adopt him. I don't know how we do that but he has stolen my heart. And he has stolen David's heart and it would be wonderful if we can have a home. I've changed my mind today."" While EveryChild praised the British musician for helping raise awareness of children affected by HIV/AIDS, it said international adoption is sending out the wrong message. James Georgalakis, EveryChild's Communications and Advocacy Manager, told CNN: ""Research conducted in the Ukraine in 2007 which showed high-profile celebrity adoptions and news around foreigners coming into the country and adopting children generally was actually encouraging vulnerable young mothers to abandon their children into homes hoping their child would be adopted by a rich foreigner and have a better life. ""So it's quite well documented that these high-profile adoptions could actually be increasing the number of children in institutions."" Do you think celebrity adoptions are a good thing? According to research by the charity's Web site, 95 percent of the children in Ukraine's institutions are not orphans, with babies born to HIV+ mothers facing particular discrimination. They are separated from their mothers and often end up in children's homes and institutions segregated from children not affected by HIV. It argues that governments such as Ukraine need to be encouraged to put more emphasis on keeping families together rather than placing them in outdated Soviet-era children's homes. ""After a great deal of campaigning by charities such as ours, the Ukraine government introduced a new 'gate-keeping' system which means the authorities will have to consider all available options before a child is placed in an institution,"" Georgalakis said. ""So when a child is taken into care or abandoned, they will have look at whether a child has other family or can be fostered by another family for example. This is a huge step forward and one that needs support. ""We will definitely be speaking to Elton and his representatives about this."" Elton John is the latest high-profile figure to be linked with a case of this kind. Earlier this year, Madonna won a court appeal to adopt a second child from Malawi. Critics of the pop-star accused the pop superstar of taking advantage of ""archaic adoption laws"" in a bid to adopt three-year-old Chifundo James. Madonna's initial attempt was denied because she did not meet a residency law that requires applicants to have lived in the country for some time before adoption. This condition was waived when Madonna -- and then husband Guy Ritchie -- adopted her first Malawian child, David Banda. The judge in that case said the interest of the child outweighed the issue of residency. Meanwhile, the British Association for Adoption and Fostering said around 4,000 children need to be adopted in UK each year, with many facing a considerable wait. BAAF Chief Executive David Holmes told CNN: ""While Elton John may be considered too old under current guidance to adopt a baby in the UK, there are many children, particularly older children, sibling groups, children with disabilities, and children from black minority groups, all waiting for a family. ""We'll certainly be reinforcing this message during National Adoption Week in Britain later this year.""","Elton John, 62, made announcement during a visit to an orphanage in Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- The Yankee soldier, who had meager possessions, must have been proud of his ring and its distinctive diamond-shaped centerpiece. Somehow, the size-11 ring was lost, discarded or left behind, only to be swallowed by the earth on a rise near Millen, Georgia. Untouched by human hands for nearly 150 years, the ring recently was discovered by archaeology students who have unearthed more artifacts at the site of Camp Lawton, a Civil War stockade and prison. The Georgia Southern University team is finding personal items that will help tell the desperate story of Union soldiers who tried to stay alive while food was scarce and disease rampant. ""The camp is as rich in information as we thought it was,"" said Kevin Chapman, a graduate student who last spring found the first of what promises to be an astounding yield of artifacts. The university in Statesboro Thursday unveiled more than a dozen of the 60 to 70 items uncovered last month. The school's museum also has acquired what's believed to be the only surviving letter from a prisoner at the short-lived camp. The recent finds include a pocketknife, buckle, a Michigan-made token used for trading and a couple of keys. The man's ring and a uniform or cap badge were found within 10 feet of each other, according to Chapman. The badge also includes a diamond feature. The Georgia Southern team believes the diamonds may represent the Union's III Corps, which saw action in numerous battles, including Fredericksburg and Gettysburg, before a reorganization in March 1864 saw it merged with other units. The corps used a diamond on its flags and insignia. ""They were so proud of their service they wore badges long after it disbanded,"" Chapman said of the III Corps veterans. Chapman says if that portion of the camp is shown to have housed veterans of the III Corps, descendants may one day be able to gaze at the precise spot where an ancestor lived. ""You can touch that ground and connect to 150 years before,"" he told CNN. Chapman found the precise location of the slave-built stockade last year and, in the soil beneath tall pine trees, the first of nearly 300 artifacts recovered at the site of the Confederacy's largest prison. The first find was detailed this time last year by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and Georgia Southern University. The prisoner artifacts were located on federal property -- the Bo Ginn National Fish Hatchery. The camp's location also extends into state property, the adjoining Magnolia Springs State Park, where the Confederate commissary, hospital and commander quarters existed. Only archaeologists and other officials are allowed on the fenced-in dig site on the hatchery grounds. This discovery of so many Civil War-era items -- including a smoking pipe, uniform buttons, a picture frame, coins, utensils, bullets and objects fashioned by Union prisoners -- is unparalleled for many reasons, archaeologists said. Civil War prisoner's letter: 'Hopeing the scene may soon change' With the exception of a farmer's plow 100 years ago, the 42 acres about 80 miles northwest of Savannah have been largely untouched. That includes being missed by relic hunters and looters who, federal officials say, ""are both thieves of time."" Over the years, people have picked clean known Civil War sites, including the notorious Andersonville prison site in west-central Georgia. Camp Lawton was built to help ease Andersonville's overcrowding. The site's remote location and maps describing it as brushy and overgrown likely saved it from relic hunters, archaeologists said. Some of the artifacts are on display at the Georgia Southern University Museum in Statesboro, about 40 miles south of the camp. The university museum recently purchased a letter written by Cpl. Charles H. Knox to his wife in Schroon Lake, New York. Knox, a member of the 1st Connecticut Cavalry, wrote it only eight days before the camp was evacuated when Union forces approached. Knox expresses hope that he will be part of a prisoner exchange between Union and Confederate forces and advises his wife, Frances, to consider selling the family cow to raise money. ""I am here & shall get out some time & hope that will be soon, but don't know,"" Knox wrote. The horseman was shipped back to Andersonville and not paroled until late February 1865, near war's end. Using modern technology along with shovels, prisoner drawings and topographic maps, Chapman pinpointed the prisoner site and found a U.S. cent of a type that was last manufactured in 1858, six years before Camp Lawton opened. Nails and other items showed that the sloped camp was the living area for nearly 10,000 men who built shelters and lean-tos near Magnolia Springs. Having just survived the scorching 1864 summer, they dug into the earth to shelter them from a cold winter, which included a November snowfall. Then, suddenly, in late November 1864, the camp was abandoned. The prisoners were taken to other camps, including back to Andersonville, as the Yankees approached during the famous March to the Sea. Archaeologists think that prisoners may have been taken to the depot in Millen in the middle of the night, and were forced to leave behind their camp belongings and thousands of keepsakes from their homes up north. Between 725 and 1,330 men died at the prison camp in the six weeks it existed. Officials said they know the ""general vicinity"" of soldier graves, but have no plans to disturb them. Conditions in Northern POW camps often weren't much better. About 3,000 imprisoned Confederates, for example, died in Elmira, New York. ""Some of the saddest part of our history was the handling of prisoners on both sides,"" John Derden, professor emeritus of history at East Georgia College in Swainsboro, told CNN last year. There are no known photos of Camp Lawton and few details of the stockade, but a Union mapmaker painted watercolors of the prison. He also kept a 5,000-page journal that included descriptions of the misery at the camp. ""The weather has been rainy and cold at nights,"" Pvt. Robert Knox Sneden, who was previously imprisoned at Andersonville, wrote in his diary on November 1. ""Many prisoners have died from exposure, as not more than half of us have any shelter but a blanket propped upon sticks. ... Our rations have grown smaller in bulk too, and we have the same hunger as of old."" The land slipped into obscurity for about 70 years, when some of it became part of Magnolia Springs State Park. Until last year, a few entrenchments were the only signs of Camp Lawton. That began to change in late June 2010, when federal officials erected a locked and guarded fence to safeguard the artifacts found at its hatchery. They are working with their Georgia counterparts to ensure the site is not touch by unauthorized individuals. Some coins, tokens and other objects that have been found were made in Europe, and indicate Union regiments made up of soldiers with Irish and German ancestry, Chapman, 37, said last year. Chapman said the team wants to learn about daily life for Union prisoners and their Confederate keepers. ""Right now we are estimating the limits of the encampment and the prisoner occupation area,"" he said Wednesday. ""We are going to continue exploring the Confederate side."" He estimated less than 1% of the site occupied by prisoners has been surveyed. ""We are just getting our feet in the door,"" said Chapman. ""This is once in a lifetime.""","Nearly 300 artifacts have been found in early archaeological investigations .

"(CNN) -- On the afternoon of August 3, a graying, slightly paunchy, well-dressed man in a mask and carrying a baseball bat strolled into the bedroom of an 18-year-old Australian woman studying for a school exam. He strapped something that seemed to be a bomb to her neck and told her not to move. Then he left. With that, a man police now identify as Paul Douglas Peters, 50, touched off a baffling international investigation that eventually reached 9,317 miles across the ocean to Buckner, Kentucky, where an FBI team arrested Peters on Monday. Authorities say Peters attempted to extort money from Madeleine Pulver's family in suburban Sydney by fastening a black box around her neck that he said in a note contained ""powerful new technology plastic explosives"" that would go off if she did not follow his instructions, according to a complaint for provisional arrest filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Louisville. Those instructions included orders to write to an e-mail address and wait for details on handing over an unspecified amount of money. Pulver spent nearly 10 agonizing hours in her bedroom as authorities tested the box to make sure it would not explode before removing it from her neck. At the same time, authorities allege, Peters was stopping off in his four-wheel-drive Range Rover at a library and video store to check the e-mail account he'd given Pulver and whiling away at least part of the time at a liquor store browsing for wine, a Sauvignon Blanc to be precise. Peters' attorney, Scott Cox, said the investment banker and attorney will contest the charges. ""It is my understanding that he has no criminal history whatsoever,"" Cox added. ""We are enormously relieved that an arrest has been made,"" father Bill Pulver said. ""These past two weeks have been a very difficult time for us."" On Wednesday, Madeleine Pulver told reporters the incident was ""all very surreal."" ""I'm glad it's all over,"" she told CNN affiliate Seven Network in  Australia. Investigators in Australia and the United States say they were able to link Peters to the e-mail address using video surveillance and access logs, and found credit card records showing that he had purchased a thumb drive, lanyard and baseball bat identical to those used in the extortion attempt, according to the complaint. A magistrate in Kentucky ordered Peters, an Australian national, held without bail until at least October 14, when he may be allowed to apply for bail. That's also when Australia will be required to request Peters' extradition. Cox told CNN Radio that the proceedings may include a probable cause hearing. Australian police plan to seek charges against him including kidnapping, aggravated breaking and entering with intent to commit a serious indictable offense, and demanding property by force with intent to steal, according to the complaint. Peters is not accused of any U.S. offenses. Assistant Commissioner David Hudson of the New South Wales Police Department said Peters was not yet a suspect when he flew to Louisville on August 8, arriving the next day. But ""a fairly detailed chain of circumstantial evidence"" -- including Pulver's detailed description of the ""heavily disguised"" assailant -- ultimately led them to the United States and the arrest. According to the complaint, a man wearing a business shirt, slacks and a blue, yellow and white mask that covered everything but his mouth and a pair of ""saggy and wrinkly"" eyes sauntered into Pulver's room, carrying a backpack and a black aluminum baseball bat. He said he wasn't going to hurt her, forced a black box around her neck using something like a bike chain and locked it. To this he added a lanyard with a green thumb drive and a plastic document sleeve containing a note. ""Count to 200,"" the man said, according to the complaint. ""I'll be back."" Pulver waited a few minutes, called out to the man but got no response. She contacted her parents and asked for police, and after a tense nine or 10 hours, tests concluded that the device was not a bomb. Australian and U.S. authorities say the e-mail account listed in the note was created May 30 at a computer using an Internet address assigned to the Chicago airport, where travel documents indicate Peters was on that day. Investigators say video surveillance linked him to the only three logins to the account, all in the hours after the break-in at the Pulver home. Surveillance cameras at a library in Kincumber, Australia, showed him pulling up in a silver Range Rover and leaving moments after the first login. The next two came at a video store in Avoca Beach, Australia. Surveillance cameras from a liquor store next to the video shop showed a man resembling Peters entering the store on two separate occasions that evening, each shortly before the e-mail account was accessed. Peters apparently spent part of this afternoon waiting for a response by shopping for Phillip Shore Sauvignon Blanc wine, according to a liquor store employee who police said remembered talking to Peters. The man, the store clerk said, appeared to be just ""wasting time,"" according to the complaint. Investigators say credit card receipts indicated that Peters bought the thumb drive, lanyard and baseball bat used in the incident in the weeks leading up to it, as well as a deleted file on the thumb drive that forensic analysis showed was created on a computer called ""Paul P."" Authorities in Australia alerted their U.S. counterparts to Peters after finding travel records showing that he had flown to Louisville on August 8 and had previously wired money to a woman living in Buckner, Kentucky, who turns out to be his former wife. The FBI sent an agent to check out the house two days later and spotted Peters in the backyard. ""I don't think he resisted in any respect,"" Scott said. Authorities do not believe his ex-wife was involved in or aware of the plot. The couple divorced in 2007, according to Cox. Peters is a globe-trotting investment banker who went to primary school in Hong Kong, attended college in Sydney, ran investments in Malaysia and spent quite a bit of time in the United States, where his ex-wife and three school-age children live, according to authorities and his attorney. A woman who identified herself as his hairdresser was quoted by the Daily Telegraph newspaper in Australia as saying he was a ""happy-go-lucky chap."" ""I was actually really shocked, you know, I couldn't believe it because he was such a nice fella,"" the newspaper quoted Tammy Schreiber as saying. How he ended up in the wealthy Sydney suburb of Mosman, where many athletes and celebrities live, allegedly attempting to extort money from the Pulvers remains something of a mystery. An Australian police official who accompanied FBI agents on the raid in Bucker said the Pulvers didn't know Peters. But it appears he was formerly employed by a company with which the Pulvers have links, according to the complaint filed in federal court. The complaint didn't elaborate, and the nature of the specific link wasn't immediately clear Tuesday. A LinkedIn profile that appears to be Peters' lists his job as managing director at Douglas Corp., formerly Allco Finance Group Malaysia. No Web listing for such a company could be immediately located. Peters was formerly the U.S. managing director at Connell Finance Co., according to the profile.

"(CNN) -- World number three Roger Federer avenged his loss in the 2009 U.S. Open final as he defeated Juan Martin del Potro 6-3 7-5 in the second round of the Western and Southern Open on Tuesday. Federer, a 16-time grand slam winner, managed to avoid a third-straight defeat to the 22-year-old, having previously lost to Del Potro at the 2009 ATP World Tour Finals. The Swiss broke Del Potro, ranked 19 in the world, once in each set and sealed victory in one hour and 32 minutes. ""I expected a tough match with Juan Martin for obvious reasons, and it went better than I thought,"" Federer, who is looking to win the Cincinnati event for a record fifth time, told the ATP Tour's official web site. Can anybody stop Novak and Serena? ""I thought I played a wonderful first set and a very good second set, too. That was obviously enough tonight. I don't think I really allowed Juan Martin to be able to play the game he usually plays."" Del Potro will now focus his attention on the U.S. Open, which gets underway on August 29, where he will return for the first time since his triumph two years ago. Federer will face wildcard James Blake in the third round, after the American defeated Italy's Fabio Fognini 6-4 6-2. Czech fifth seed Tomas Berdych also sealed victory on Tuesday as he picked up his fifth-career win over Del Potro's compatriot Juan Monaco. In the remaining first round matches that were played, Wimbledon semifinalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat Croat Marin Cilic 6-3 6-4. The 15th seed will play American qualifier Alex Bogomolov Jr., who emerged from a clash with his wild card compatriot Robby Ginepri with a 6-4 6-3 success. In an all-Spanish encounter, ninth seed Nicolas Almagro advanced at the expense of Albert Montanes with a 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 triumph.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Thursday placed the United States squarely on the side of democratic reform in the Middle East and North Africa, declaring in a major policy speech that the wave of change sweeping the region ""cannot be denied."" Addressing a global audience, Obama condemned the use of force against Arab Spring protesters by longtime allies and adversaries alike.  He also said the eruption of demands for greater opportunity in Arab nations could be used to kick-start stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. At the same time, Obama applied his own pressure by declaring as policy the long-held idea that a future Palestinian state should be based on borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war. In the past, the United States has unofficially supported a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict based on the borders in place prior to the war 44 years ago in which Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights and Sinai Peninsula. Obama became the first president to formally endorse the policy, but he acknowledged the need for modifications through the negotiating process due to conditions on the ground. Obama also dismissed the notion of al Qaeda-style extremism appealing to future generations of Muslims, asserting that the organization was ""losing its struggle for relevance"" long before the killing of Osama bin Laden on May 2. The president's speech -- the subject of intense speculation in recent days -- was a long-promised overview of America's changing Middle East policy in the wake of the Arab Spring that started unfolding in Tunisia last December. In recent months, Washington has often appeared to struggle to keep up with the pace of events not only in Tunisia, but also in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, and elsewhere. Administration officials have also wrestled with an Arab suspicion of U.S. motives fueled by decades of American support for the region's autocratic regimes. ""Shouts of human dignity are being heard across the region,"" Obama declared, speaking in front of a group of diplomatic and military officials at the State Department.  ""We support political and economic reform in the Middle East and North Africa that can meet the legitimate aspirations of ordinary people throughout the region."" The president acknowledged that ""there will be times"" when America's ""short-term interests do not align perfectly with our long-term vision."" ""But we can -- and will -- speak out for a set of core principles"" including freedom of religion and expression, and equality under the law, he promised. ""It will be years before this story reaches its end,"" Obama said.  But ""the events of the past six months show us that strategies of oppression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore."" Among other things, Obama accused Iran of hypocrisy for publicly supporting protests in parts of the Arab world after violently cracking down on protests at home. He blasted the Syrian regime for reacting to dissent by choosing ""the path of murder and the mass arrests."" ""The Syrian people have shown their courage in demanding a transition to democracy,"" Obama said.  President Bashar al-Assad ""now has a choice: he can lead that transition, or get out of the way."" On Wednesday, Obama imposed new sanctions against al-Assad and other top officials in Damascus. Obama also criticized the crackdown against Shiite protesters in Bahrain -- a key Persian Gulf ally and home of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet.  The president made no mention of struggles for greater rights in neighboring Saudi Arabia, another close ally. A large portion of the president's speech was devoted to the Israel-Palestinian conflict.  The administration's strategy for a comprehensive settlement has been seemingly derailed in recent months.  Former Sen. George Mitchell unexpectedly submitted his resignation as the president's Mideast envoy Friday, and deadly clashes broke out Sunday between pro-Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces. Ongoing Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and Palestinian steps toward a unilateral declaration of statehood have driven the two sides further apart since Obama took office. Additional doubts about the viability of the stalled peace process were raised this month in the wake of a formal reconciliation agreement between the two largest Palestinian factions: President Mahmoud Abbas' party, the West Bank-based Fatah; and the Islamist group Hamas, which rules Gaza. Both Israel and the United States consider Hamas a terrorist organization and have voiced strong opposition to the inclusion of the group in any unity government, demanding that it first renounce violence, recognize the state of Israel and abide by all previous agreements. Nevertheless, the president renewed his push for a two-state solution Thursday, declaring that the borders of Israel and a future Palestinian state should be based on pre-1967 lines ""with mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states."" ""The full and phased withdrawal"" of Israeli security forces from the West Bank has to be accompanied by evidence of a Palestinian state that can help secure the peace and prevent attacks against Israel, he said. But a continued Israeli presence in the West Bank is inconsistent with long-term dreams of a secure Jewish and democratic state, Obama said. ""The Palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves, and reach their potential, in a sovereign and contiguous state,"" the president said. Neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis offered a warm response to Obama's speech. Hamas called Obama's remarks ""empty of concrete significance"" and promised not to recognize ""the Israeli occupation.""  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stated that Washington should stand by previous U.S. commitments relating ""to Israel not having to withdraw to the 1967 lines, which are both indefensible and which would leave major Israeli population centers ... beyond those lines."" On a broader regional level, Obama stressed the importance of economic development to accompany political reforms.  Toward that end, he announced $1 billion in debt forgiveness for Egypt, as well as another $1 billion in loan guarantees for Cairo. He also promised a new ""comprehensive"" trade and investment partnership initiative with the Middle East and North Africa.  Europe will play a key role in moving the initiative forward, he said. Obama also defended U.S. and NATO intervention in Libya, arguing the move was necessary to prevent an imminent massacre. ""Time is working against (Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi,"" he asserted.  When Gadhafi goes, ""decades of provocation will come to an end"" and a democratic transition can begin, he said. Thursday's speech came nearly two years after Obama delivered an address in Cairo, the Egyptian capital, that called for ""a new beginning"" between the United States and the Muslim world. Today, many in the Middle East and North Africa consider the Cairo speech a collection of lofty ideals that lacked sufficient follow-through, and they have been looking for Obama to signal substantive and concrete policies that support the aspirations of the region's people. Marwan Muasher, a former Jordanian foreign minister and longtime advocate of Arab reform, said Wednesday that the Middle East is a new environment now, where young men and women are laying their lives on the line for democracy throughout the region. They need to be told their cause is just and how the United States will support them. If Thursday's address is viewed as just ""another Cairo speech, forget it,"" said Muasher, now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""It was great two years ago, and even then the feedback was mixed, because people wanted to see what he would do.  If he doesn't have much to add this time, people will not be fooled by it."" Gigi Ibrahim, a 24-year-old Egyptian activist and blogger, predicted Obama's words will have little impact in her country. ""At this point, whatever President Obama will address will really be irrelevant to what the situation is now because we're really building democracy from the bottom up,"" Ibrahim told CNN, adding that ""America is not the model of democracy that we are striving for."" She called U.S. policy on the Middle East ""hypocritical"" because, she said, the United States ""will support a dictatorship if it's aligned with its interests."" That attitude is still rife throughout the Middle East and North Africa, noted CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. With Egypt facing economic crisis, the Libyan conflict at a stalemate, an ongoing harsh crackdown on demonstrators in Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process at a standstill, there is little belief in the region that Obama or the United States can do much to help, Gergen said. ""I think it's going to be very difficult in the near term to generate excitement about his policies in the Middle East,"" Gergen said. Obama's speech came in a week when the White House is strongly focused on Middle East issues. He met Tuesday with Jordan's King Abdullah II at the White House, and will meet Friday with Netanyahu.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Rebels marched toward Tripoli Wednesday, capturing a town southwest of the capital from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces, a rebel fighter told CNN. Fighting also engulfed Misrata, east of Tripoli, where 14 rebels were killed and 42 others wounded, according to Mohamed Ibrahim, a rebel spokesman in the city. Three civilians also died in rocket attacks launched by Gadhafi's men, Ibrahim said. CNN could not verify the information. Just west of Misrata, in Dafniya, 14 rebel fighters were killed and 42 were wounded Wednesday during a firefight with Gadhafi forces, said Ibrahim. The rebels ran over Al-Qawalish, a town of about 4,000 residents 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of Tripoli, a stronghold for Gadhafi since the start of the uprising in February. Their attacks got under way around 7 a.m. from the north, the west and the south. On the western front, journalist David Adams said rebels were using Grad launchers, two Russian tanks and a number of other vehicles, rockets and guns. The rebels captured the town around 2:30 p.m., entering from all three fronts, some having captured vehicles belonging to Gadhafi forces. Some rebel fighters could be seen breaking windows, shooting doors of houses and rummaging through families' belongings. Some said they were looking for weapons, but they appeared to be looting. After they had lost control of the town, Gadhafi forces began shelling its periphery with Grad rockets. At least 12 government soldiers died, six were wounded and seven were captured, said Adams. Rebels, whose casualties included at least seven dead and 15 wounded, said their next target would be Al Assabiah, said Adams. Hassan Al-Jiwali, a rebel fighter from the Nafusa Mountains, said 50 of Gadhafi's men were killed and 15 were captured in the offensive. Fighting has erupted in the western mountains in recent weeks as more than four months of battles have failed to yield a decisive victory for either side. The first United Nations joint mission to reach the devastated mountain region found many people in dire need of food. A World Food Programme statement said markets were not functioning due to limited fuel and cash, and basic services such as electricity and water were lacking in some areas. The rebels said they were moving northward, closer to the capital on the Mediterranean Sea. They intended to march to the city of Garyan, which sits on the main highway to Tripoli. Also Wednesday, NATO said its air forces targeted military re-fueling equipment in the Brega area southwest of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. ""These precision strikes will limit the ability of pro-Gadhafi forces to threaten Libyan civilians and significantly degrade logistical support for Gadhafi's campaign in eastern Libya,"" said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, commander of Operation Unified Protector, in a news release. France has acknowledged arming the rebels, saying the weapons were for self-defense. However, French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said Tuesday the weapons were no longer necessary because the rebels were becoming ""more autonomous."" But debate continued over France's decisions. In a contentious closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting Tuesday, Russia argued that, by sending weapons, France had violated the council's resolution that authorized the use of NATO force in Libya. CNN's Kareem Khadder and Kathryn Tancos contributed to this report.","NEW: NATO warplanes targeted military refueling equipment near Brega .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. official in charge of investigating fraud in Iraq said Monday he is carrying out a third audit to see if it might determine what happened to $6.7 billion in cash that was flown into Iraq eight years ago and is now missing. ""It has not been properly accounted for,"" said Stuart Bowen, special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction. The money -- which belonged to Iraq -- was part of a sum of $20 billion that was shipped into war-torn Baghdad in bricks of hundred-dollar bills. They were shrink-wrapped and stored in the Central Bank of Iraq to pay for reconstruction. ""Our job as auditors is to find out how that was used, whether it was wasted or fraudulently misused, as we fulfill our mandate to get to a conclusory answer,"" he said. Bowen blamed the system that existed then. ""The system was too loose and unregulated in 2003 and 2004,"" he said. ""Billions of dollars being flown into, effectively, a war zone; an insurgency exploding into a civil war; and fairly continuous turnover in government ministers and ministry personnel presented an atmosphere that some have described as Wild West-like and I think that's a fair description."" Bowen said he did not want to speculate on who the potential criminals might be, then added, ""But this money was delivered to Iraqi control, and we have in the past had a number of cases reported to us about interim ministers who did steal."" During 2003 and 2004, he said, the money was under the aegis of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the entity created by the United States to govern Iraq after the fall of the regime of Saddam Hussein. Afterward, Bowen said, the Pentagon and the fledgling Iraqi government shared responsibility for safeguarding some of the money; it was the Pentagon that asked him to investigate the whereabouts of the cash. A Pentagon spokesman contacted by CNN said the investigation found that ""all of these funds remained under the control of the government of Iraq at all times."" The money came from the sale of Iraqi oil, and was diverted by international sanctions and stored at a Federal Reserve facility in the United States before being shipped to Iraq. Though it was never U.S. taxpayer money, Americans may still be on the hook for some of it. Iraqi officials have told Bowen they may sue to reclaim the lost money, and they may have a case, said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, the former chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""The truth of the matter is, the U.N. said to the United States, 'You are now entrusted with this money; you have a fiduciary responsibility for the Iraqi people to use it for their benefit,'"" Waxman said. ""And now we can't account for $6.7 billion."" The Iraqi Embassy in Washington did not respond to suggestions that Iraqi officials may have stolen some of the money, but a high-ranking Iraqi official said the inspector general's report has shown that ""the United States failed to put in place accountable and transparent financial controls to safeguard Iraqi funds."" Already, fraud and abuse have been uncovered and a number of convictions obtained, Bowen said. He predicted that, before the matter is closed, there will be more prosecutions.","Stuart Bowen's job is to try to find out what happened to $6.7 billion in missing funds .

"(CNN) -- Ivory Coast international Emmanuel Eboue has completed his move from Arsenal to Turkish side Galatasaray, just one day after former Gunners captain Cesc Fabregas left the club to join European champions Barcelona. Eboue, 28, has cost the Istanbul-based team $5 million and has signed a four-year contract at the Turk Telekom Arena. The right-back joined Arsenal from Belgian side Beveren in 2005 and made 214 appearances for Arsene Wenger's side. Fabregas signs five-year Barcelona contract . ""Arsenal have agreed terms with Turkish side Galatasaray for the transfer of Emmanuel Eboue,"" read a statement on Arsenal's official web site. ""Everyone at Arsenal thanks Emmanuel for his contribution towards the club and wishes him the best of luck for the future."" Eboue was a member of the Arsenal side beaten in the 2006 Champions League final by Barcelona -- and has played for the Ivory Coast at the last two World Cups -- Germany 2006 and South Africa 2010. Another player leaving the Emirates Stadium is Mexican striker Carlos Vela, who has joined Spanish side Real Sociedad on loan. What now for Arsenal and Fabregas? Vela spent the second half of last season on loan at West Bromwich Albion, where he scored two goals in 12 appearances. In the wake of Fabregas' departure on Monday, Arsenal have announced Dutch international striker Robin van Persie will take over as club captain. Van Persie, 28, joined Arsenal from Feyernoord in 2004 and was their top scorer last season with 18 league goals.

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish warplanes bombed suspected Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq's rugged mountains for a second consecutive night Thursday after an ambush on a southeastern Turkey highway killed eight soldiers and a government-employed guard, the semi-official Anatolian News Agency reported. In the second operation, F-16s took off Thursday night from Diyarbakir and bombed targets in northern Iraq, returning three hours later, the agency said, citing ministry sources. Earlier Thursday, the military had said in a statement that Turkish artillery pounded more than 100 targets in the border region. ""Similar activities of the Turkish Armed Forces, both domestic and abroad, will continue with determination until the separatist terrorist organization that uses northern Iraq as a safe haven and an attack base against Turkey is eliminated,"" the military said. The Kurdish Firat News agency, which is sympathetic to the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, confirmed Wednesday night's air and artillery attacks in the rugged mountains of northern Iraq, where the rebels have long operated. Firat quoted an unnamed rebel commander saying that the air raid was expected. ""It wasn't a surprise for us.  We had measures.  Air raids happen almost every year.  We are a 30-year guerrilla movement. Therefore, they didn't achieve any results from yesterday's attack,"" the rebel commander said. Turkish war planes were once again spotted flying over the Qandil mountains of northern Iraq on Thursday, Firat reported. Ankara said fighters from the PKK carried out Wednesday's deadly ambush. Thursday, military helicopters carried the flag-draped coffins of the eight soldiers to a funeral ceremony in the eastern border city of Van. ""Our pain is very big.  Our sorrow is like the mountains,"" Brig. Gen. Levent Kose, a senior Turkish military commander, announced at the ceremony.  He then issued a bellicose warning to the PKK. ""They won't win, they won't achieve anything.  They will melt in their own darkness.  They will dry in their own quicksand.  They will choke on their own blood."" Meanwhile, Turkey's president, prime minister and top military commanders gathered for a meeting of the country's national security council in Ankara Thursday.  The officials were expected to discuss policy challenges, including the conflict with the PKK and official Turkish frustration with another neighbor, Syria, where the regime has violently cracked down on anti-government protesters. The latest round of fighting with the PKK could present a major test for the Turkish armed forces.  Long one of the most powerful political institutions in Turkey, the military has been shaken after scores of generals and admirals were arrested and put on trial for allegedly plotting to overthrow Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government. In an unprecedented move last month, the country's four most senior military commanders all resigned simultaneously. Kurdish fighters have been locked in a bloody conflict with the government since the 1980s. More than 30,000 people have been killed in the fighting, many of them ethnic Kurds. The Kurds are Turkey's largest ethnic minority. For decades, Ankara imposed oppressive policies, which banned Kurdish names and their language, and sometimes referred to the community as ""mountain Turks."" Erdogan's government has attempted to improve relations with Turkey's Kurds in recent years by launching a Kurdish channel on state television and acknowledging ""mistakes were made"" in the way Ankara treated the minorities. But tensions have escalated between the government and the main Kurdish nationalist political party in recent months. After winning a larger number of seats in June parliamentary elections, the main Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) boycotted the swearing-in ceremony for new lawmakers. Kurdish lawmakers are protesting a decision by Turkey's electoral board, which disqualified a prominent Kurdish candidate from participating in the June election. Politician Hatip Dicle was barred from running due to a 20-month prison sentence he received for ""making propaganda for a terrorist organization,"" a Turkish reference to the PKK. Meanwhile, PKK fighters have claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks, including a Saturday ambush near the southeastern province of Sirnak that killed at least three soldiers. In a statement e-mailed to CNN, the PKK also claimed responsibility for last week's sabotage of a natural gas pipeline between Turkey and its eastern neighbor, Iran. The rebel strikes, as well as a battle last month that left at least 13 Turkish soldiers dead, have raised fears of an escalation in the long-simmering war between the Turkish state and Kurdish separatists.","NEW: F-16s strike suspected PKK camps for second consecutive night .

"(CNN) -- Four more people have died in Germany, health officials said Sunday, bringing the total number of deaths from an E. coli outbreak to 35. All but one of the deaths were in Germany, with the other occurring in Sweden, according to the World Health Organization and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. The number of people infected with E. coli as of Sunday was 3,256, according to the European center (ECDC). Of those, 812 have the severe form of the intestinal illness. All but five people had traveled to or lived in Germany during the incubation period for infection, typically three to four days after exposure, the WHO said. German authorities have indicated that food items including bean sprouts and other vegetables originating from a producer in Lower Saxony, Germany, are the most likely source of the infection. German health authorities have declared that all food products originating from the producer be pulled from the market, according to the ECDC. The agricultural ministry in Lower Saxony said Sunday that it is still not clear how sprouts from a farm in the state became contaminated with the bacteria. ""It is not clear whether an employee brought the bacteria into the company or whether it was brought in with seeds which then contaminated the worker,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""Finding this out is important, however, so that we can create early warning systems to prevent such outbreaks in the future,"" the statement said. Investigators found bean sprouts were the cause of the outbreak when 17 people became ill after eating at the same restaurant, said Reinhard Burger, president of the Robert Koch Institute, which is responsible for disease control and prevention in Germany. Only those who ate food containing the sprouts became ill, he said. Farmers in Spain, France, the Netherlands and Belgium have been seeking compensation for their losses. The European Commission has proposed that the European Union pay about $300 million, but Spain alone claims about $600 million in losses. In Spain, the produce exporter Frunet filed suit last week over the Hamburg state government's initial claims that Spanish produce was to blame for the outbreak.  The company, based in Spain's southern Malaga province, expects to file another suit against the government seeking 1 million euros, or $1.4 million, in losses from fresh produce it had to destroy, Frunet owner Antonio Lavao told CNN. Health officials first blamed Frunet's organic cucumbers for the outbreak. CNN's Al Goodman and Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","Health officials say the cause of contamination is still unclear .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- For 53 hours this weekend and early Monday, a 10-mile stretch of Interstate 405 will be closed in western Los Angeles for a bridge demolition. You would think the world is coming to an end. The project -- dubbed ""Carmageddon"" -- has brought countdown clocks, traffic apps, detour maps and warnings to stay away or enjoy the weekend on the couch. Amtrak and JetBlue are offering specials to get away from it all. The good news? With the aim of eventually reducing traffic congestion, the northbound section of the freeway between U.S. 101 and Interstate 10 will be closed Saturday and Sunday for the demolition of the Mulholland Drive Bridge. The weekend work will clear the way for the widening of the freeway through the Sepulveda Pass. A northbound high-occupancy vehicle lane also will be added. The bad news? With historic traffic backups expected, the northbound section of the freeway between U.S. 101 and Interstate 10 will be closed Saturday and Sunday for the demolition of the Mulholland Drive Bridge. ""Severe traffic conditions are anticipated in local and regional areas during the weekend of the full freeway closure,"" Metro warns on its website. The 405 freeway, which hosts about 500,000 cars a day, stretches from the San Fernando Valley south into many of the city's posh neighborhoods, including Beverly Hills and Bel Air, and on to Irvine. A four-mile southbound section will be closed between U.S. 101 and Getty Center Drive ramps. Los Angeles International Airport is urging travelers to get there by public transit, especially rail, or to stay at nearby hotels for early morning flights.

""We're going to actually plant trees and grow coffee in China, in the Yunnan Province."" The U.S.-based chain is making what Schultz calls ""a comprehensive strategic commitment to doing business in China, in a way that's locally relevant."" Yunnan coffee is already known as some of the best in Asia, owing to the southern province's fertile soil, weather and water. Starbucks is working with Yunnan's provincial government ""to share our coffee knowledge, to help Yunnan continue to develop into a top-quality coffee-growing region and bring the distinctive Yunnan coffee taste to our customers around the world,"" Schultz said.

""We've discovered a part of the area there that can produce the world's best coffee,"" the CEO said. ""And in three to four years, we will bring coffee from Yunnan to the world."" In a country full of tea drinkers, Starbucks is making good progress, Schultz said. ""We've been here for 12 years now, with 400 stores in the mainland, 800 stores in greater China,"" he said. As far as what's driving business in China, Schultz said, ""Obviously, there's a tremendous size, in terms of the aspirational middle class, the numbers of people who have access to disposable income. And also they're quite familiar with western brands. One of the things that surprised us the most is how aware they were of Starbucks before we got here. ""And how fast they embrace change is another thing that has really surprised us. People were drinking black coffee when we got here. Now they are drinking cafe latte and cappuccinos and Frappuccinos,"" Schultz said. ""China is going to be the fastest-growing, biggest market for the future of Starbucks, outside of North America,"" he added.","Starbucks expects to start exporting Yunnan beans in three or four years .

"(CNN) -- Wimbledon champion Serena Williams recovered from an awful start to beat Tsvetana Pironkova in the opening round at the Eastbourne grass-court event, her first match since victory at the All England Club last year. The American lost the opening five games to her Bulgarian opponent, but gradually found her form to secure a 1-6 6-3 6-4 victory in just over two hours. The 13-time grand slam champion, who has been off the court for nearly a year because of a long-standing foot injury, before developing a blood clot in her lungs, will now face top seed Vera Zvonareva in a repeat of last year's Wimbledon final. Serena: 'I came back from death bed' Williams told reporters: ""It wasn't an easy match but more than anything, I wanted to win. ""She's an unbelievable player and beat Venus at Wimbledon last year. When I saw the draw I thought 'Oh my god.' I'm a little rusty but I enjoy being back on the grass."" Russian Zvonareva secured her place in the second round with a 6-3 6-3 victory over Briton Heather Watson. Serena's win followed on from older sister Venus knocking out eighth seed Andrea Petkovic in her comeback match on Monday. Fourth seed and former French Open champion Francesca Schiavone is also through after a 7-6 6-1 win over Kaia Kanepi of Estonia, while another former Roland Garros winner, Ana Ivanovic of Serbia, saw off up-and-coming German Julia Goerges 6-4 6-3. Ivanovic told reporters that she is starting to find her form again after a dismal last couple of years. ""In the last few weeks I'm starting to gain more confidence again and there are things that I have to work on during matches,"" she added. British number one Elena Baltacha, who is now up to 61st in the world, gave the home crowd some cheer with a 6-2 6-1 thumping of Frenchwoman Aravane Rezai, while holder Ekaterina Makarova of Russia struggled past Croatian qualifier Mirjana Lucic 6-1 3-6 6-4. In the men's section, South African sixth seed Kevin Anderson defeated British qualifier Alexander Slabinsky 7-5 6-3, but fifth seed Sergiy Stakhovsky suffered a shock 6-3 6-2 defeat at the hands of former Wimbledon semifinalist Rainer Schuettler. Later in the afternoon, Queen's Club runner-up and top seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga enjoyed a comfortable 6-2 7-5 victory over Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan. Meanwhile, there was a major shock in the UNICEF Open in s'Hertogenbosch with top seed Kim Clijsters crashing out in the second round. Clijsters, the reigning U.S. Open and Australian Open champion, was beaten 7-6 6-3 by Swiss-born Italian qualifier Romina Oprandi, ranked 82nd in the world. Clijsters later told reporters she would undergo more tests on the right ankle that she hurt while dancing at a cousin's wedding earlier this year. ""I'm going to have some more tests and then I'll be able to give a more specific answer about the situation,"" said Clijsters. ""I feel like I was hitting the ball very well in practice. I was moving well. I wasn't really worried too much,"" she added. Oprandi will next face Kimiko Date-Krumm after the Japanese veteran beat Lourdes Dominguez-Lino 7-6 6-0.","Wimbledon champion Serena Williams through to the second round at Eastbourne .

"(CNN) -- Wildlife officials in Colorado say they have killed a bear believed to have been involved in an attack on a teenage boy Friday morning. Park officials used 10 tracking dogs to hunt for the brazen black bear, which wandered into a heavily-populated campsite overnight. They established a scent trail by late afternoon, said spokesman Randy Hampton of Colorado Parks and Wildlife. At the end of the trail, they discovered a 200-pound  bear that matched the description of the one involved in the early morning attack. It was shot and killed. Officials had said earlier they would have to kill the bear, pointing to the bold and aggressive behavior it exhibited when it wandered into the site with so many campers. The incident occurred in an encampment filled with hundreds of people participating in a bow-hunting event, Hampton said. ""We manage wild bears for a healthy and thriving population,"" said Dan Prenzlow, regional manager for wildlife with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. ""But when an individual bear enters a tent and attacks a sleeping person, we manage that animal to protect the public safety."" The bear entered a tent occupied by a teenage boy and at least one other person early Friday. It bit the boy on the leg, but the teen fought it off.  The bear was then chased away by the teen and other campers at the site. Wildlife officials who responded to the scene determined that the black bear had been poking around the campsite before it attacked the teenage boy.  Investigators said they found a ransacked cooler and evidence that food had been eaten before the bear entered the tent. The teenager was taken to a hospital in nearby Leadville, Colorado, Hampton said.  He was treated for deep lacerations on one of his legs and released.  He is expected to recover but will receive followup treatment. Hampton estimated that there are around 12,000 black bears on Colorado's 23 million acres of public land.  There are no known brown bears or grizzlies in the state. Earlier this month, a man was killed in a grizzly bear attack in Wyoming's Yellowstone Park.  But park officials said the man, who was hiking with his wife, surprised the female grizzly while she was with her cubs.  They determined that she was acting defensively and decided not to put the bear down. CNN's Nigel Walwyn contributed to this report.","Black bear enters a tent and bites a teenage boy in the leg .

"(CNN) -- Former ""Gunsmoke"" actor James Arness, who played Marshal Matt Dillon in the western TV series for 20 years, died Friday from natural causes, according to his website. He was 88. Over the two decades of ""Gunsmoke"" episodes from 1955 to 1975, Arness worked with hundreds of actors, some of them just up-and-comers such as Harrison Ford, Burt Reynolds and Charles Bronson. He also worked with Bette Davis. Arness left behind a letter to his fans, which was posted on his website after his death: . ""I had a wonderful life and was blessed with some many loving people and great friends. The best part of my life was my family, especially my wife, Janet. Many of you met her at Dodge City so you understand what a special person she is,"" Arness wrote. ""I wanted to take this time to thank all of you for the many years of being a fan of 'Gunsmoke,' 'The Thing,' 'How the West Was Won' and all the other fun projects I was lucky enough to have been allowed to be a part of. I had the privilege of working with so many great actors over the years. EW: Why Arness was greatest TV Western lawman . ""I was honored to have served in the army for my country. I was at Anzio during WWII and it makes you realize how very precious life is,"" Arness wrote. ""Thank you again for all the many letters, cards, emails and gifts we received from you over the years. You are and always have been truly appreciated,"" he concluded. Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 26, 1923, Arness later served in the Army and was sent in 1944 to Anzio, the Italian beach that the Army said was the setting for the largest and most violent armed conflict in the history of mankind. Arness was wounded in his right leg and received the Purple Heart. According to an Army website, during the four months of the Anzio Campaign, the Allied VI Corps experienced more than over 29,200 combat casualties (4,400 killed, 18,000 wounded, and 6,800 prisoners or missing) and 37,000 noncombat casualties. German combat losses were estimated at 27,500 (5,500 killed, 17,500 wounded, and 4,500 prisoners or missing), according to the Army.

"New York (CNN) -- ""The Book of Mormon,"" a musical satire about religion written by the creators of ""South Park,"" and ""War Horse,"" a British play about a boy's search for his beloved horse, dominated the 65th annual Tony Awards Sunday night. The apparent predestination of ""The Book of Mormon"" as the big winner was not lost on comedian Chris Rock before he presented the best musical Tony. ""This is such a waste of time,"" Rock joked. ""It's like taking a hooker to dinner."" ""The Book of Mormon"" got the best musical Tony, along with eight other trophies. The show had been nominated in 14 categories. What the show lacked in suspense was made up with entertainment as two-time Tony host Neil Patrick Harris guided the three-hour broadcast from Broadway's Beacon Theatre. Harris, who is openly homosexual, opened the show with a tongue-in-cheek number proclaiming ""Broadway's not just for gays anymore."" Most of the dozen song-and-dance performances were from nominated musicals, but the leading actors for ""Spider-man, Turn Off the Dark"" sang a duet from the show that opens on Broadway next Tuesday. ""War Horse"" was the big winner among plays, winning all five categories in which it was nominated -- including the best play Tony. It is the story of a teen's journey to find his horse after it was shipped to France for duty in World War I. If an award was given for the most emotional and breathless acceptance speech, it might have gone to Nikki M. James, the 30-year-old actress who claimed her first Tony after a decade of work on Broadway. ""They say wrap it up, but I will not leave the stage,"" James said, well into her acceptance of the best featured actress in a musical Tony. James, who played an African girl in ""The Book of Mormon,"" claimed the only acting award given to the show. ""The Book of Mormon"" wins set up what might have been the most unlikely of Tony ""thank you"" speeches. ""It it weren't for you, we wouldn't be here,"" Trey Parker told fans of his Comedy Central animated series ""South Park"" as he and Casey Nicholaw accepted the Tony for best direction of a musical. Later, when Parker accepted the best musical award, he thanked ""Joseph Smith, the founder of the Morman religion."" ""He couldn't be here tonight, but you did it, Joseph, you got the Tony,"" Parker said. John Larroquette now has a Tony to sit on a shelf with his five TV Emmys. The former ""Night Court"" actor won the best featured actor in a musical for his Broadway debut in ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying."" Ellen Barkin, a veteran film and television actress, won the best featured actress in a play Tony for her Broadway debut in ""The Normal Heart."" ""Performing in 'The Normal Heart' is a very profound experience for me,"" Barkin said in her acceptance speech. ""It's the proudest moment in my career."" Barkin's ""Normal Heart"" co-star John Benjamin Hickey was given the best featured actor award. The play, which focuses on the early years of the AIDS epidemic in New York, was chosen the best play revival. The best leading actor in a play award went to Mark Rylance for his role as Johnny ""Rooster"" Byron, a former daredevil motorcyclist in ""Jerusalem."" Norbert Leo Butz, who portrays FBI Agent Carl Hanratty in ""Catch Me If You Can,"" captured the best leading actor in a musical Tony.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The guard who killed the half-brother of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, had for years worked with International Security Assistance Forces against Taliban militants, according to three local officials with direct knowledge of the dealings. Sardar Mohammed, who authorities say shot and killed Kandahar's provincial council chief Ahmed Wali Karzai, received training from ISAF and participated in intelligence gathering against militants across the region, according to Besmellah Afghanmal, a provincial council member with close ties to the Karzai family. He ""was one of the trusted commanders for the Karzais,"" Afghanmal told CNN. ""Sardar Mohammad was working with American Special Forces closely and he was participating in many operations with American Special forces against the Taliban in (the) south."" Others, like provincial parliament member Hashim Watanwal, say Mohammad had worked with both U.S. and Canadian forces in Kandahar -- an ethnically Pashtun dominated region long-considered the Taliban heartland. Baz Mohammed, a Kandahar tribal elder with close connections to the Karzai clan, said the guard was ""a trustworthy person"" who collaborated regularly with ISAF in Kandahar. An ISAF spokeswoman declined to comment on the claims. Though suspected of corruption and opium dealing, Wali Karzai was considered a major power-broker in Afghanistan's restive south and a bulwark for his brother against the Taliban militancy. His death Tuesday sent shock-waves across Afghanistan's political landscape, and prompted President Karzai to weep as mourners gathered for his half-brother's burial the following day. Saidkhan Khakrezwal, a member of the Kandahar provincial council, said he and others were with Wali Karzai when the guard came into the room and asked to talk to him. The guard took ""Wali to another room and shoots him with a pistol that he had in his hand,"" Khakrezwal said. Local authorities say the shooter was then shot dead by other guards. The Taliban soon claimed responsibility for the shooting, saying Mohammed had been working for them. It is not clear whether the guard had been a member of a Taliban sleeper cell or if the killing was motivated by some other factor. On Thursday, in a brazen strike illustrating the power and reach of Afghan militants, a suicide bomber slipped into a Kandahar mosque and killed at least six people, wounding 15 others. The attack occurred as several high-ranking Afghan officials gathered to remember Wali Karzai.

"Havana (CNN) -- More than 50 years after the fact, Cuba has published the diary that Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara kept during the armed struggle that he waged alongside Fidel Castro from the Sierra Maestra mountains. ""Diary of a Combatant"" recounts Guevara's experiences from coming ashore in Cuba on December 2, 1956, until shortly before the bearded rebels declared victory January 1, 1959. According to Guevara's widow, Aleida March, the goal is ""to show his work, his thoughts, his life, so that the Cuban people and the entire world get to know him and don't distort things anymore."" The book was edited by the Che Guevara Studies Center, which is directed by March, and published by Australia's Ocean Press/Ocean Sur. Researchers said that Guevara kept his diary in hand-written notebooks and that part of the reason they put off publishing the diary was because some of the notebooks were missing. ""Where are the notebooks? We don¹t know, and there are a lot of different versions,"" Maria del Carmen Ariet, a leading researcher from the Che Guevara Studies Center, said at a press conference to launch the book. But she also said that much of the material was included in ""Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War,"" a more polished account of his time in the Sierra Maestra mountains that Guevara published in 1963. ""We'd have to ask if he really wanted the 'Diary of a Combatant' published,"" she said. Some of Guevara's other diaries have been commercially successful, most notably ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" the memoir of a 23-year-old medical student on a road trip in Latin America. Guevara was born in Argentina in 1928 and met Castro in 1955 in Mexico City, where he was plotting his return to Cuba to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. During the guerrilla fighting in the mountains, Guevara was the first subordinate to be promoted to the rank of ""comandante"" by Castro. He went on to become Cuba's Central Bank chief before heading to Africa and then Bolivia to continue armed struggles. He was killed in 1967.","""Diary of a Combatant"" spans period between 1956 and 1959 .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Divers have completed their search of a Russian cruise ship that sank last weekend with the loss of many lives, the Emergency Situations Ministry told CNN Friday. The official death toll has reached 114 -- including 66 women, 28 children and 20 men, the ministry said. The bodies of 15 people are still missing. There were 208 people on the ""Bulgaria"" at the time of the accident Sunday, of whom 79 were rescued. Divers have checked all the boat's compartments, the ministry said, and are now looking for more bodies around the boat as well downstream on the Volga River, where they could have been carried by the current. The area where search efforts continue has been enlarged to 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the scene, Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin said at a briefing Friday. Preparations are under way for the cruise ship to be raised from the river bottom in the coming days. Two large boat cranes, one from Moscow and another one from Volgograd, which will be used for the lifting, are on the way to the accident site. ""We have asked the Emergency Situations Ministry to keep 23 divers at the scene to continue the search for bodies even during the lifting operation,"" Levitin said. Specialist military divers were brought in mid-week to aid in the search efforts. Four people face criminal charges over the sinking of the ship, which Russian media have called the most devastating river accident in the country's history. All agencies and organizations involved in tourism must be held accountable, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said at a special government meeting Friday devoted to the accident. ""This means that not only people who rubber-stamp documents, not only scapegoats, but also organizers of cruises must answer,"" he said, in comments broadcast by Russian state TV. ""The measure of punishment to be chosen must make it clear to each executive, irrespective of rank, that he or she will be held responsible for each cruise not only administratively, but also criminally. Criminal liability must be sufficiently serious."" Medvedev said it would be too expensive and complicated for Russia immediately to replace the fleets of ageing ships in use on rivers and at sea. But, he said, that did not mean those carrying out inspections should not be thorough. ""It is our task to find out the causes of the accident -- they are more or less clear now -- and also to prevent disasters,"" he said. ArgoRechTour, the company that sub-leased the ""Bulgaria"", had illegally organized five cruises on the ship in the summer of 2011 prior to the accident, the Russian Prosecutor General's Office said in a report published on its website Friday. The vessel did not have a license to transport passengers, was overloaded, and was last repaired more than 30 years ago, the prosecutors said earlier this week. They had also established that the left engine of the ship was damaged, the prosecutors said on their website. The vessel was built in 1955 in Czechoslovakia, according to Russian law enforcement officials. The double-deck cruise ship went down near the village of Syukeyevo in Tatarstan, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the city of Kazan. Kazan is about 724 kilometers (450 miles) east of Moscow.","NEW: The search for bodies has been extended to 125 miles from the scene, the transport minister says .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A Georgia woman has been convicted of human trafficking and other charges for bringing two Nigerian women to the United States and forcing them to work in her lavish home like slaves, the U.S. Justice Department said Monday. Bidemi Bello, 41, was convicted on eight counts by a federal jury late last week: two counts each of forced labor, trafficking for forced labor and making false statements in an application to become a U.S. citizen, and one count each of document servitude and alien harboring. ""The evidence showed that this was a case of modern-day slavery hidden within an expensive home in an upscale neighborhood,"" said Sally Quillian Yates, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. Bello recruited her first victim, identified as ""Laome,"" in 2001, according to prosecutors. The girl was 17 when she traveled, using a fake British passport that Bello had gotten for her, they said. The second victim, identified as ""Dupe,"" traveled to the United States in 2004, when she was 20, also on a fake passport. Both women were promised a better life and told that Bello would help further their educations. But upon arriving in the United States, they discovered a decidedly darker reality. Bello beat the women for any perceived infraction -- not cleaning well, not responding quickly enough to the cries of her child, talking back -- with whatever weapon was available: shoes, a large wooden spoon, electric cords and her hands, evidence showed. Testimony also revealed that Bello forced the women to sleep on the floor or couch and bathe with a bucket. They were not allowed to eat what they cooked, and Bello sometimes gave the women spoiled food, evidence showed. Prosecutors said Bello never paid the women for their years of work and made them dependent on her for all their basic necessities. Attempts to contact Bello's attorney were unsuccessful Monday. Laome managed to escape with the help of a friend, buried beneath blankets in the back of the other woman's car, while Dupe scrounged enough money to pay for a cab and sought help at a local church, prosecutors said. Both women testified during the one-week trial. Bello, who holds both American and Nigerian citizenship, is scheduled to be sentenced August 24. The two forced labor charges and the two trafficking for forced labor charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. She is also expected to be stripped of her American citizenship, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan Coppedge. If she is, Bello would be deported after serving her expected sentence. Around the world, as estimated 12.3 million adults and children -- 56% of whom are women and girls -- are the victims of forced labor, bonded labor and sex slavery, according to U.S. State Department. The trade puts approximately $32 billion into the pockets of traffickers each year. Coppedge, who is helping prosecute Bello's case, said she is sure similar cases exist in Atlanta and elsewhere in the United States. ""Unfortunately, yes,"" she said. ""I do think there are others."" Her office urged anyone with information on a human trafficking case to contact the Atlanta FBI at (404) 679-9000.","Bidemi Bello was found guilty on eight counts .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spain's opposition conservatives were heading to victory Sunday over the ruling Socialists in local and regional elections, with 84% of the vote counted, according to official results. The opposition Popular Party had 37% of the vote to the Socialists' 27%. The Socialists lost two major posts to conservatives: mayor of Seville and presidency of the Castilla La Mancha region --- where the famed Don Quijote novel was set. This will be the first time in 30 years Socialists will not be at the helm of the La Mancha region. Exit polls indicated the Socialists could also lose the prized Barcelona mayor's post after 32 years to the moderate Catalan nationalist party, Convergence and Union. Polls predict the ruling Socialist Party will suffer deep losses to the conservatives in voting for all 8,000 Spanish city and town mayors and for presidents of 13 out of the 17 regional governments. The outcome is viewed as a bellwether for national elections, due no later than March 2012. The elections came after a campaign overshadowed by week-long protests in Madrid and other cities over the nation's deep economic crisis. Despite a court-approved ban on demonstrations the day before the elections, the demonstrations had continued on Saturday. The Socialist government did not order the police to disband the peaceful demonstrations on Saturday, despite the electoral board's ban that said the day prior to balloting should be a day of reflection, without politicking. Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba had said earlier that police would not create even more problems than already existed in the streets. Rubalcaba voted early on Sunday, shortly after polls opened at 9 a.m. Rubalcaba is widely expected to seek the nomination of the Socialist Party as candidate for prime minister in the next general elections. The current prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, announced last month he would not seek a third term. His government has been squeezed by Spain's 21% unemployment rate, the highest in Western Europe, and a financial crisis that prompted unpopular austerity measures. That's what helped start a wave of protests May 15, when Spaniards using social media sites like Facebook convened demonstrations that attracted large crowds. The protests against the political and financial establishment continued and gained force throughout last week, as demonstrators set up encampments in Madrid's central Puerta del Sol plaza and at emblematic plazas in Barcelona and many other Spanish cities. Overall, reports indicated that tens of thousands took to the streets across the nation in the past week, and news media attention on the protests quickly overshadowed the campaign. Protesters decided Sunday to stay at least another week in Madrid's central Puerta del Sol plaza, said Juan Lopez, a protest spokesman and internet technology manager who is currently unemployed. ""The assembly has just approved that,"" Lopez told CNN by phone. The protesters have divided themselves into decision-making bodies they call assemblies, which debate and then vote on issues. Lopez said the decision applies only to the protest in Madrid, which has been the largest in Spain. Barcelona and other cities would make their own decision. ""We are trying to coordinate,"" he said, but added that, so far, nationwide collaboration is not in place. The sprawling tent city in Madrid's plaza includes a kitchen, a painting workshop to churn out protest placards, a communications office to answer media inquiries and even a day care nursery. Young people dominated the protests on Saturday, but there were also families with young children, senior citizens and many people who have jobs and said they're concerned about the nation's future. Spain has a 42% jobless rate for people ages 16 to 24. A total of 34 million Spaniards were eligible to vote on Sunday, including 500,000 foreigners, mainly from other European Union nations, who have established residency in Spain. About 100,000 police officers were on duty to maintain safety.","Conservatives have 37% of vote to Socialists' 27% with 84% votes counted .

"(CNN) -- South Africa declared national days of mourning Saturday to honor Albertina Sisulu, an icon of the anti-apartheid movement who died this week. Sisulu was 92. The president said flags would fly at half-mast and mourning would last until her burial, which will take place with military honors. Funeral plans for Sisulu, who died Thursday, have not been finalized. Sisulu was married to anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu for nearly 60 years. The couple played a pivotal role in the anti-apartheid movement, and her husband was imprisoned for decades with former South African President Nelson Mandela. Affectionately called ""Ma Sisulu,"" she was also detained numerous times and was held in solitary confinement for seven weeks in 1963, the ruling African National Congress said. As soon as she was free, she took to the streets to rally against the trials of anti-apartheid movement leaders. ""Soon after her husband was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964, Albertina was served with a harsh five-year order prohibiting her from attending any gatherings of more than two persons, confining her to her location and preventing her from any political activities,"" the ruling party said. Years later, she faced various bans, including one confining her to her home at nights, weekends and public holidays. Despite the bans, she continued with her quest for liberation. ""Although politics has given me a rough life, there is absolutely nothing I regret about what I have done and what has happened to me and my family,"" she said, according to the ruling party. ""Instead, I have been strengthened and feel more of a woman than I would otherwise have felt if my life was different."" Sisulu and her husband dedicated their lives to the struggle for freedom in South Africa, and endured banishment, detention and humiliation, said President Jacob Zuma. ""Mama Sisulu has over the decades been a pillar of strength not only for the Sisulu family, but also the entire liberation movement as she reared, counseled, nursed and educated most of the leaders and founders of the democratic South Africa,"" Zuma said. The president said the nation has lost a leader and a role model. Sisulu founded the Federation of South African Women and other civic groups. She gave political guidance and served as a mother figure to activists and other civic organizations, the African National Congress said. ""South Africa remains eternally grateful and indebted to this stalwart of the liberation and an assuming leader of all races of our people,"" Zuma said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Gary Kirsten has been named as the new coach of South Africa's national cricket side following his successful three-year stint with India. The 43-year-old decided not to renew his contract with India after leading the sub-continent team to victory in the limited overs Cricket World Cup in April. Kirsten, a former opening batsman for South Africa, also transformed India into the world's top-ranked team in the five-day Test format. ""I believe this is a natural progression as far as my coaching career is concerned. My coaching philosophy will not be any different than it was for the Indian team,"" he told the Cricket South Africa website on Monday. ""I always endeavor to influence players in a positive way and give them options so that they can grow both as cricketers and as people."" CSA chief executive Gerald Majola said he was delighted to appoint a man who scored more than 7,000 runs in 101 Tests for his country, scoring 21 centuries. ""The selection of Gary has brought to an end a process that started several years ago when he first expressed interest in the position,"" Majola said. ""Gary's credentials and cricketing experiences speak for themselves and the Board of CSA is confident that he will lead the Proteas to new heights in all formats of the game."" Kirsten fills the gap left by caretaker coach Corrie Van Zyl, who took the Proteas to the quarterfinals of the World Cup after Mickey Arthur quit in January 2010. He will be assisted by coach Russell Domingo, while former South Africa star Allan Donald will be the team's bowling coach. Kirsten has appointed A.B. de Villiers as the Proteas' new captain for limited overs matches, and the batsman will be Graeme Smith's deputy for Test matches. Meanwhile, the rain-hit second Test between England and Sri Lanka at Lord's appeared to be heading for a draw after the hosts built a 142-run lead going into the final day in London. Alastair Cook followed up his first-innings 96 with an unbeaten 61 as England reached 149-2 at stumps on Monday. The opener put on 117 for the second wicket with Jonathan Trott (58) after captain Andrew Strauss was dismissed for a second-ball duck by Chanaka Welegedara. Sri Lanka had earlier been dismissed for 479, seven runs behind England, after resuming the fourth day on 372-3. Steven Finn took 4-108 to become, at 22, the youngest English bowler to reach 50 Test wickets. England will be hoping to set a target and see if they can repeat the final-day demolition of the Sri Lankan batsman that earned an innings victory in the opening match in Cardiff last week.","Cricket South Africa appoints Gary Kirsten to be new national coach .

"(CNN) -- The Canadian woman who was rescued after being stranded and alone for 49 days in a Nevada wilderness left behind handwritten notes about her ordeal, officials said Monday. The notes were found in the van where Rita Chretien was found on Friday, said Owyhee County (Idaho) Sheriff Daryl Crandall. The van was in remote territory near where Oregon, Idaho and Nevada meet. ""Please help. Stuck"" is the way one note begins. The call for help has a date written below it that simply reads ""since Mar 19/11."" According to officials, the date marks the last time anyone had seen Chretien or her husband. The next line continues with ""No food. No gas. Dead bat. (battery) Lost my way!"" Then the writing gets smaller as the space on the paper begins to run out, the note now reads, ""Al went to get help. Find Mountain City. Did not return!"" And finally, the last words on the page written in red read, ""Maybe died along the way?"" Written in smaller spaces on the paper in a different ink is the couple's name, where they are from, and their phone number. The note also gives name and number of the couple's son, and the date the couple is expected back in home. A second note starts with detailed GPS readings on it, and then outlines the couples inability to get cell service in the rugged mountainous area. Scribbled on the side of the second note is a message that started ""We're headed to Vegas"" and ended ""Got lost."" Pictures of these notes were taken by the Owyhee County Sheriff's Department amid the weekend search for Albert Chretien, who remained missing three days after his wife's rescue. He left his wife to get help three days after their minivan got stranded off-road in the cold, untamed wilderness. That left Rita alone without much beyond some hard candy, a bag of trail mix, some books and the clothes she'd packed for her trip to Las Vegas. Plus, according to her son Raymond Chretien, she always had faith. Scores of men and women had searched for the Chretiens since the Penticton, British Columbia, residents were last seen March 19 leaving a Shell gas station convenience store in Baker City, Oregon. On Friday, more than a month later, hunters wandered into the area where the van was sitting. Rita Chretien shot up from her spot in the 2000 Chevrolet Astro's backseat when she heard them outside, mustered her lingering strength to open the door and step out shoeless. She waved. Three days later, she was in fair condition, resting comfortably in an Idaho hospital, spending time with her children. ""Right now, we're just celebrating,"" said her son, Raymond, on Sunday, Mother's Day. Even the doctor who oversaw Chretien's care at St. Luke's Magic Valley Medical Center in Twin Falls, Idaho, acknowledged it was not easy to explain how a 56-year-old woman could have such a positive prognosis and demeanor given what she'd gone through. ""In this case, for a person with suboptimal nutrition to survive so long -- let's just say that it is understandable to call it a miracle,"" Dr. James Westberry told reporters Sunday. While rainy and overcast weather forced authorities to call off the first day's air search for Albert Chretien, Cpl. Dan Moskaluk of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Saturday that a search dog and about 20 people, riding six to eight all-terrain and four-wheel drive vehicles were on the case. A K-9 unit was also brought in by the Owyhee County Sheriff's Department to help search for the missing man on Saturday. Paula McCollum and her dog Viva covered about four miles in each direction looking for any sign of Chretien. But after the daylight started to fade and weather took a turn for the worse, search efforts came to halt. McCollum said she was shocked that Rita Chretien was able to survive the cold, mountainous region alone, and she wished her husband had remained at her side. ""People keep going,"" McCollum said as she recounted her efforts to locate Albert Chretien, ""they don't turn-around."" But by backtracking the Chretiens may have found their way back to a road, she said. Sheriff Crandall agreed. He said the couple's van was found five to eight miles from a ranch where they could have gotten help. Pictures released by the sheriff's department show the van in a extremely remote area with no visible roads. The van was stuck in caked mud, ,a shovel pictured near the back of the van, indicating that someone had been trying to free the vehicle from the mud. While the odds are dwindling that Albert Chretien will be found alive, authorities certainly are not ruling it out, said the police spokesman. ""Neither family nor investigators would have thought that we'd be reporting, after seven weeks, of actually finding somebody alive,"" Moskaluk said. ""Until we know exactly what happened to Al, it remains a mystery."" Rita and Albert Chretien's stop in Baker City was recorded on the store's surveillance tape. They were en route to a trade show convention in Las Vegas. But they later turned off the highway onto a forest service road that led into Nevada, intending to enjoy the ""scenic route,"" said her son, who'd heard the full story from his ailing mother. The couple took some wrong turns and had thought, based on their map, that their road was better than it was. Then, about 20 miles from the highway, ""apparently the road conditions ... degraded quite drastically,"" said Moskaluk, the police spokesman. By the time darkness fell, the minivan had succumbed to the combination of snow and mud, and was unable to move. On March 22, Albert Chretien left the van, setting off to get help. His wife, who Raymond Chretien said is ""not an outdoorsy type of person,"" remained behind. Rita Chretien rationed the little food available -- a beef jerky, some trail mix, fish oil pills, and one piece of hard candy per day. She'd go outside for a walk once a day, using the sunlight to melt snow for drinking water and going to a nearby stream. In the meantime, she had plenty of time to read a few books (some several times) and the Bible, and record her thoughts in a journal. ""She did it because she didn't know the outcome of this,"" her son said, adding that he had not yet read the journal. ""It was intended to sort of tell the story what happened over (those) days."" All the while, Rita Chretien got weaker, losing 20 to 30 pounds, according to Moskaluk. Her son said that, in her last few days in the wild, she'd come to peace with the sense that her time was dwindling. She penciled May 6 as a critical day in her mind: -- either she'd be rescued or she'd die. ""She definitely had hope. But of course, just like us, every day goes by, you start preparing yourself for both options,"" her son said. ""So she was prepared for either."" After her discovery, Rita Chretien was airlifted to the Idaho hospital. There, doctors worked first to address her starvation and dehydration, then to build up her ability to eat meals again and gain strength. By Sunday, Westberry said he still hadn't seen her walk, but he said there were no indications of long-term problems and her prognosis was good. Her spirits and evident desire to live, the doctor said, were even better. ""It is unusual for us to see someone in this type of situation to actually not only survive, but to be doing so well at this time,"" Westberry said. ""She obviously had the mindset of survival, and that must have been something that helped her go as long as she did."" For her son, the best thing was how little his mother had changed after her ordeal. She laughed just the same, and was just as warm, genuine and caring as she'd always been, he said. ""I would have hardly known anything had happened to her,"" he said. ""It was just beyond belief. It's just her. It's amazing.""

"(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal had to battle hard to reach the third round of the French Open after a stiff test against fellow Spaniard Pablo Andujar. After being taken to five sets by American John Isner in the opening round, Nadal was made to work hard for a three-hour 7-5 6-3 7-6 (7-4) victory at Roland Garros. The 24-year-old, who is looking for his sixth French Open title, will now play Antonio Veic in the next round after the Croatian defeated Russian 28th seed Nikolay Davydenko 3-6 6-2 7-5 3-6 6-1. After his match, AFP reported that Nadal refused to blame the conditions: ""For a moment today I played better, but in general the match wasn't good for me -- not because of the wind though,"" Nadal said. ""I am practicing well, but not playing well when I play matches -- no excuses. The conditions can have an effect, but it's better to find solutions inside myself than outside. ""My movement is still a little bit slow. I am not happy, but I am here. The beginning of Roland Garros is always tough for me."" Just like in his opening match, Nadal was sluggish in patches and world number 48 Andujar took advantage to push his opponent to the wire in the first and third sets. The pair exchanged four consecutive breaks of serve in the opening set but when Nadal clinched the second 6-3 with relative ease, a comfortable win looked on the cards. But Andujar raced into a 5-1 lead in the final set after breaking serve twice, Nadal surviving an incredible seven set points to force the match into a tie-break, which he eventually won 7-4. Elsewhere, British fourth seed Andy Murray beat Simone Bolelli 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 7-5 in blustery, overcast conditions on Court Philippe Chatrier. A series of double faults cost Murray ground in the opening set but he battled back into contention to force two set points before taking the tie-break 7-3. Murray's game came together in the second set as he broke his opponent's serve in game seven and took the set but the third was another evenly matched affair. The world number four said the ""brutal"" conditions made life difficult on court. ""The wind was swirling the whole time,"" Murray told reporters. ""It was changing during the rallies so you'd think on one shot 'I've got the wind with me' and it was changing, so there's no real rhythm -- it was really tricky today."" Fifth seed Robin Soderling, from Sweden, beat Spanish qualifier Albert Ramos 6-3 6-4 6-4 while Spaniard Fernando Verdasco beat Belgium's Xavier Malisse 6-4 3-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-1. American Mardy Fish eased past Robin Haase, while Colombian Alejandro Falla knocked out German 20th seed Florian Mayer. Sam Querrey, the 24th seed, was defeated by Ivan Ljubicic and Serbian 15th seed Viktor Troicki saw off Tobias Kamke.","Rafael Nadal beats Pablo Andujar in the second round of the French Open .

"New York (CNN) -- The International Monetary Fund announced its search for a new managing director as its former chief, Dominique-Strauss-Kahn, is confined to a Lower Manhattan apartment following his release on bail from a Rikers Island jail. A private security guard will monitor Strauss-Kahn around the clock, a source with knowledge of the bail agreement said. Strauss-Kahn, who is accused of trying to rape a maid last week in hissuite of rooms at the Sofitel hotel in New York, will pay the cost of the security guard at the apartment in the city's financial district, the source told CNN. A real estate website states two-bedroom apartments with 9-foot ceilings in the landmark, 23-floor, turn-of-the-century building with a doorman start at $4,250 per month. The rental application asks, ""Do you or do any of your occupants have charges pending against you or against them for any criminal offense(s)?"" Strauss-Kahn does. He faces two counts of criminal sexual act; two counts of sexual abuse; and one count each of attempt to commit rape, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. In the charge of criminal sexual act in the first degree, Strauss-Kahn is accused of having ""engaged in oral sexual conduct with an individual ... by forcible compulsion,"" an indictment states. Supreme Court Judge Michael Obus ordered the release of the 62-year-old economist on Friday over the objection of the prosecution, which said he is a flight risk. While Strauss-Kahn is in his apartment, where he is to stay with his wife, Anne Sinclair, he will not be able to leave except for medical reasons, Obus said. Once he is in a longer-term location, the former banker must give six hours' notice before leaving. Defense lawyer William Taylor alluded to Strauss-Kahn's reported failure to win approval to stay at another apartment in pleading Friday with members of the news media to grant his client privacy. ""The reason that he had to move is because members of the press attempted to invade his private residence and interfere with his family's privacy,"" Taylor said. The conditions of Strauss-Kahn's release included $1 million cash bail and $5 million bond. A document signed by bondsman Ira Judelson shows that the bond was secured by money from Sinclair. Judelson would not divulge what Sinclair put up as collateral. ""I feel very comfortable with the bail package (and) the family is,"" Judelson told reporters. ""I worked with them all last night on putting this together. They're good people."" On Friday, more details emerged about the alleged attack May 14 in Suite 2806 of the Sofitel hotel. A law enforcement source with knowledge of the case said a room service attendant entered the suite a short time before the 32-year-old Guinean maid arrived. The room service attendant didn't think anyone was in the suite of rooms and used a pass key to let himself in to retrieve some room-service items, the source said. He told police he left the door ajar while inside, according to the source. When the maid showed up at the door about noon, the room-service attendant told her to enter, then departed, the source said. Once inside, the maid parked her cleaning cart in the doorway, as dictated by hotel policy. A short time later, Strauss-Kahn emerged naked from a room and attacked her, the victim has alleged. Prosecutors allege that Strauss-Kahn chased her through his suite, sexually assaulted her and tried to rape her. A criminal complaint states Strauss-Kahn shut the door at one point during the alleged attack. The law enforcement source said the maid escaped about 1:30 p.m. About an hour before his 4:40 p.m. flight was to take off from John F. Kennedy International Airport for Paris, Strauss-Kahn called the hotel to say he had left his cell phone. He asked security to look for it in his room and to have it delivered to the airport, the source said. By then, police had been called to the hotel. Though hotel staff never found the phone, they followed police orders, telling Strauss-Kahn they had found it and would deliver it to him, the source said. Port Authority police took over from there, walking a compliant Strauss-Kahn from his first-class seat to a squad car at the airport, the source said. At the time, Strauss-Kahn was in the fourth year of a five-year term with the global financial institution and was paid $441,980 in 2010, according to the most recent annual report. He also got $79,000 and first-class travel for him and his family while he was on company business. On Friday, the IMF said that Strauss-Kahn will receive a $250,000 separation payment and a ""modest annual pension"" thereafter. We don't disclose pension payments,"" said IMF spokesman William Murray. ""But it is well below the separation payment figure."" The dean of the IMF Executive Board, Shakour Shaalan, announced Friday that the institution adopted a procedure to select its next managing director. In a statement, Shaalan said the board will meet with final candidates in Washington ""with the objective of completing the selection process by June 30, 2011."" Strauss-Kahn proclaimed innocence in a resignation letter to the IMF Executive Board late Wednesday. ""To all, I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me,"" he said. His next court appearance is set for June 6. The judge granted the bail Thursday on condition that, in addition to posting $1 million in cash and a $5 million bond, Strauss-Kahn surrender his travel documents and submit to home detention. A criminal court judge denied him bail Monday, saying the fact that he was taken into custody aboard an Air France jet made him a flight risk. Strauss-Kahn's lawyer argued Thursday that his client had bought the ticket on May 11, and that he was not fleeing anything. The maid testified before a grand jury Wednesday, according to her attorney. Defense attorney Benjamin Brafman has disputed her allegations, saying ""forensic evidence, we believe, will not be consistent with a forcible account, and we believe there is a very, very defensible case."" CNN's Susan Candiotti, Adam Reiss and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","Strauss-Kahn is staying in a New York apartment after leaving a Rikers Island jail .

"Joplin, Missouri (CNN) -- A Missouri mother said Thursday that her 16-year-old son was killed by this week's powerful tornado, one of scores who have been confirmed dead even as authorities try to track down many others who are considered missing. Michelle Hare told CNN that her son Lantz, who was ripped from a car Sunday night by winds exceeding 200 mph in Joplin, is dead and his body has been located. In the wrenching hours and days since the tornado, the boy's father, Mike Hare, said he'd searched hospitals and continually called his son's cell phone, getting no answer. ""It rang for the first day and a half, and now it goes straight to voice mail. But just in case he gets it, I want him to know his dad loves him,"" the father said earlier this week. Lantz Hare was among those on the list, released Thursday by the Missouri Department of Public Safety, of 232 people from the southwest Missouri city for whom missing persons reports have been filled out. At least 126 people in Joplin had died due to the storm as of Thursday night, said Newton County Coroner Mark Bridges. That makes the tornado the single deadliest to touch down in any U.S. community since modern record-keeping began in 1950. The Hares were among many around Joplin, still desparately searching for missing loved ones and clinging to hope. Christina, Caleb and Robert Hayward, for instance, have not seen their mother since the tornado. ""She went for pizza and never came back. It was three, four hours, and we knew,"" Robert Hayward said Wednesday.  ""We all miss her. She was a great person. She didn't deserve this at all. Any one of us would trade places with her."" One of the frustrations for families desperately trying to find their loved ones was a holdup at the morgue. Some were told that they may have to wait for two weeks before they can visit the morgue to search for relatives. Bridges told CNN that people who can make a positive identification of a relative, such as through tattoos, will be allowed to view a body matching that description. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said state officials were brought in ""to get this information out much more quickly and respectfully for these families that need to hear the information about the loved ones who are -- have been lost."" Families of the missing have provided DNA samples and contacted dozens of hospitals, shelters and nursing homes in their bids to learn whether they have a ""John Doe"" or ""Jane Doe"" that could be their loved one. Charles Writer, 74, is one of 12 residents of Greenbriar Nursing Home on the unaccounted for list. Ten residents and a staff member at the home were killed, a company official said. Writer's family received conflicting reports on the Alzheimer's patient's possible fate, said Leah Mitchell, whose husband is Writer's nephew. They have handed out flyers and used a spreadsheet to contact about several dozen facilities. ""There are two sides of the family,"" said Mitchell. ""One has accepted he's deceased, the other side is not sure."" Patricia Dawson's family Thursday continued its search for the 74-year-old Joplin homemaker. They, too, have contacted many hospitals and nursing homes within 200 miles. Daughter-in-law Sharyn Dawson said the missing woman ""is an awesome granny to our 6-year-old,"" who hasn't been told about the situation.

"(CNN) -- Darren Clarke holds a one-stroke lead going into the final round of the British Open at Royal St George's, Sandwich, as the Northern Irishman carded a one-under-par 69 to defy the wind and rain that plagued the early part of the day. The 42-year-old, who has never won a major championship, is now just 18 holes away from breaking that duck, as he lies on a five-under-par total of 205, one of just six players to be under par after three rounds. Clarke, who is looking to go one better than his second place in the 1997 British Open, will be paired alongside American Dustin Johnson on the final Sunday, after the 27-year-old from South Carolina posted a joint-best 68 for a 54-hole total of 206 (-4). Numbers game: British Open stats you need to know . Johnson is also seeking his first major success, although he was deprived of a possible win in last year's U.S PGA Championship when he was controversially penalised two shots in the final round for grounding his club in a bunker. The only other player to shoot under 70 was American Rickie Fowler -- and the Ryder Cup star's 68 was enough to put him joint third with veteran Dane Thomas Bjorn on 208, three strokes behind Clarke. Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez (72) and joint overnight leader Lucas Glover (73) are another stroke behind to complete the sextet who remain under par. Clarke, who is bidding to become the third Northern Irishman to win a major tournament in just over a year, following the achievements of compatriots Graeme McDowell and McIlory, told the official European Tour website: ""From tee to green I can't really play any better than that. Ugly and unforgiving: Why Britain offers golf's toughest test . ""I had one of those days where I had full control of my ball flight, although I didn't have the speed with my putting at all. But if somebody had said before the start I could have a 69, I would have bitten their hand off."" The popular Clarke was cheered loudly throughout his round and he commented on the support: ""I think most of the crowd identify with a guy who's not quite an athlete and likes a pint! ""I have a chance to realise a dream now and that would be fantastic. I have been fortunate to win Ryder Cups and world championships, but a major has so far eluded me,"" he added. The third round began in terrible weather conditions, making low scoring practically impossible, although the wind and rain did ease up later in the day to make for a more benign atmosphere for the later starters. Among those players whose chance of victory were swept away with the wind and rain were Paul Casey (78), Pablo Larrazabal (76), Masters champion Charl Schwartzel (75), defending champion Louis Oosthuizen (74) and tournament favorite Rory McIlory (74). However, world number three Martin Kaymer remains in touch on level par despite carding a three-over-par 73, while former world No.1 Phil Mickelson shot a superb 71 to also lie on level par.","Darren Clarke leads British Open by one shot after carding a one-under 69 .

"(CNN) -- The United States must beat Guadeloupe on Tuesday to guarantee a quarterfinal place at the Gold Cup, having suffered a shock first group-stage defeat in the CONCACAF region tournament. Bob Bradley's team go into the final match of pool play in Kansas on the back of Saturday's 2-1 loss to Panama in Florida -- the nation's first such Gold Cup setback in 27 matches and the first in nine encounters with the Central American side. ""I don't think the heat was a factor. On the night we were not sharp enough,"" coach Bradley told the U.S. Soccer website. ""With the fast turnaround, we're clearly going to consider some changes and be ready to go Tuesday night in Kansas City."" Five Mexico stars banned after failing drugs test . Panama led 2-0 with first-half goals from Luis Tejada and Gabriel Gomez, the latter a penalty after Tim Bream fouled Blas Perez. Striker Clarence Goodson reduced the deficit in the 68th minute when Michael Bradley flicked on Landon Donovan's corner, but the four-time Gold Cup champions could not manage an equalizer. The win put Panama on top of Group C with two victories from two ahead of the final match against Canada, who are level with the U.S. on three points after beating 10-man Guadeloupe 1-0. Jean-Luc Lambourde was sent off in the fourth minute after a foul on Will Johnson, while Dwayne De Rosario scored the winner from the penalty spot in the 51st minute after Stephane Zubar was booked for fouling Ali Gerba. The Panamanians lost to the U.S. in the 2005 final after a penalty shootout, and reached the quarterfinals in 2007 and 2009. In Sunday's Group A games, defending champions Mexico take on second-placed Costa Rica having already qualified for the last eight after two successive 5-0 wins. However, Mexico's hopes have been hit by the suspension of five players -- Guillermo Ochoa, Francisco Javier Rodriguez, Edgar Duenas, Antonio Naelson ""Sinha"" and Christian Bermudez -- who tested positive for the banned drug clenbuterol. To finish second, El Salvador -- whose only point came in a 1-1 draw with Costa Rica -- must beat bottom nation Cuba by 11 goals and see the 2009 semifinalists lose to five-time champions Mexico. Group B concludes on Monday, with Jamaica already through to the quarterfinals after two victories ahead of the clash with second-placed Honduras in New Jersey.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The bloody beating of Nicolas Cage's son on a Hollywood sidewalk last week followed a search for the 20-year-old because the actor wanted to see his son before leaving town, a source with knowledge of the incident said. A lawyer for Cage said he was ""looking for Weston because he didn't have his cell phone and he wanted to get in touch with him to do some recording."" Cage's request that the man he paid to be his son's assistant locate his son ""doesn't justify what occurred, which was a deliberate, provoked attack where Weston was in no condition to defend himself,"" Cage attorney Martin Singer said Monday. The younger Cage asked Los Angeles police to investigate the assistant, Kevin Villegas, for the alleged assault, according Los Angeles Police Sgt. John Gomperz. Villegas was fired after the incident last week. Weston Cage was placed under a psychiatric hold after Los Angeles police responded to the incident Tuesday, but he was released over the weekend. Cell phone video posted online showed Weston Cage being repeatedly hit as he was pinned down on a sidewalk. ""He wanted Kevin to leave, and what happened, at least three witnesses told me, there was a provocation,"" Singer said. ""Weston threw a weak kick. He put Weston down on the floor, and he began a barrage of punches, 13 to 15 to the face."" ""I deeply lament the incident that occurred between me and Weston last Tuesday,"" Villegas said, ""and plead with the media and the public to suspend their judgment of the episode until all of the facts come to light."" The violent incident came amid a dispute between Weston Cage's mother, Christina Fulton, and Nicolas Cage over how to deal with their son's psychological issues, which are outlined in legal document filed in Fulton's lawsuit against Cage. She said she put her acting career on hold for two decades to raise the child while Cage, one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors, pursued his career. Fulton is suing Cage over unpaid taxes and the Hollywood home where she raised Weston, and is seeking to regain legal control over her son, who court documents say suffers from ""a number of mental, psychological and physical ailments."" He lived with Fulton after she and Cage, who were never married, split up when Weston was a child. Villegas was hired several years ago as Weston Cage's personal wrestling coach when he was in high school. He later became a personal assistant to Nicolas Cage to help with his son. ""Because of a confidentiality agreement, I am limited in what I can share publicly on this matter,"" Villegas said. ""I'm grateful that Weston is getting the care that he needs and wish him all the best."" Villegas was following orders from Nicolas Cage to find and hold on to his adult son the afternoon of the incident, said the source, who asked not to be identified because of legal and confidentiality issues. The older Cage's lawyer denied the actor asked the assistant to hold on to his son.  He only wanted to have the younger Cage call his father, Singer said. The source disputed an initial report that the fight began when Villegas told Weston Cage he could not order a certain item from a restaurant menu. Fulton blames Nicolas Cage for what she said is her son's downward spiral since he turned 18 and left her legal guardianship. ""I do not want him with Nicolas Cage,"" Fulton said. ""I do not want him in that care. That is not the care my son needs."" Weston Cage, in a statement delivered through his father's lawyer Friday afternoon, said that he did not want his mother to be involved in his care. ""I am an adult,"" Weston Cage said. ""I don't want to have anything to do with my mother. Any problems that I have ever had is because of the relationship that I had with my mother."" When Fulton heard the quote, she called it ""an absolute disgrace,"" suggesting that Cage's lawyer solicited a statement from her son while he was under a psychiatric hold at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. ""My son is under a spell. He's under a trance,"" Fulton said. ""Weston would say whatever his dad wants him to say."" Fulton said it is Nicolas Cage's fault that their son is in a hospital. ""He had his chance,"" she said of the elder Cage. ""He had his chance to make it right. My son had a healthy environment here. He had a system that was fantastic. I built that with myself and my team."" She said she fired Villegas three years ago, but Nicolas Cage rehired him, she said. Nicolas Cage, in a statement from his spokeswoman Friday, called Fulton's comments blaming him for his son's psychiatric troubles ""unfortunate and inappropriate."" ""This is a time to focus only on giving love and full support to Weston, not an opportunity to lay blame on his father, a man who loves his son very deeply,"" Cage said. Fulton said Cage was rarely around for her son growing up, while she dealt with his medical and psychological issues. ""For 18 years, I raised Weston so Nicolas could go be Nicolas Cage, and go be a superstar, and he did,"" she said.  ""So I raised this boy, 24/7, we were glued to the hip."" After Weston's 18th birthday, his father ""orchestrated"" his removal from her care by persuading the employees she hired to work for him and giving Weston his own home and money, Fulton said. ""They all go work with Nicolas Cage because he has the money and he has the bank account and he has the fame, and I don't,"" she said. Weston's special needs were not being met without her, she said. ""My son right now has been under the care of Nicolas,"" she said. ""That didn't work. It's very obvious it didn't work. It failed miserably, failed miserably."" Singer, Cage's lawyer, said Fulton's lawsuit against Cage is her motivation for attacking her son's father. ""Ms. Fulton comments about Mr. Cage are absurd, and it's very unfortunate that she would lash out like this because her son does not want to have anything to do with her,"" Singer said. ""This is clearly all about money for Ms. Fulton."" Fulton's lawyer said she would file for conservatorship of her son next week so she could ensure that he will get the care he needs when he is eventually released from the psychiatric hold. ""I'd like my son to be with his mom, where it worked,"" Fulton said. ""I'd like my son to be in an environment where it worked.  You know, 18 years of being successful, 18 years of watching my son respond to all the medical intervention that I have given him and all the support. Why would you mess with that? Why would you interfere with that? My son needs to be home.""","NEW: Cage's lawyer confirms the actor sent an assistant to find his son .

"Key West, Florida (CNN) -- They are both baby boomers, both still living their dreams, but only one of them is feeling secure about retirement. She has her eyes on valuable coins, while he is following butterflies. The ultimate guide to retirement . The Key West Butterfly and Nature Conservatory is a tropical oasis. As you walk along the path, through the gazebo and across the little bridge, butterflies are all around you. Some will land on your shoulder if you stand still long enough. Here in the habitat, there are 60 species of butterflies and 29 species of birds, says co-founder George Fernandez. ""This is a unique experience,"" he says. He's always sharing his knowledge like a proud kid. ""The Atlas moth is very unique. It lives only four to five days, very, very short life cycle,"" he tells two of his guests. The conservatory opened in 2003. Just like the butterflies, it has been flying high ever since. Thousands of people come here every year. ""It starts with having a passion, having a dream, having a mission,"" says Fernandez. Now after 20 years of hard work, the former gallery owner says that dream, that passion has given this baby boomer and his partner some security. ""We have invested everything that we have and we own into making this a success, and by God, we were gonna do it, and by the grace of God, it came to fruition,"" says Fernandez. Fernandez could retire tomorrow if he chose. But he says that won't happen, ""In the course of eight years, we have found that this has been incredibly rewarding financially, spiritually, emotionally. I wouldn't trade it for the world."" How much do you need to retire? Like Fernandez, 62, Carol Tedesco, 52, says she's fulfilled. ""Would I do it differently? No. I really wouldn't,"" Tedesco says. But unlike Fernandez, Tedesco couldn't retire tomorrow if she wanted to. ""I love my life,"" she says, ""I make enough money for the life that I have, but I don't have a retirement."" 4 in 10 American's can't afford to retire . Tedesco is a freelance photographer, writer and expert on treasure coins recovered from shipwrecks. On her desk is a book she's written, ""Treasure Coins of the Nuestra Senora de Atocha and the Santa Margarita"" and albums of wedding photos she's done for clients. Tedesco came to Key West years ago. She didn't even bring her car, figuring she'd only be here for a few months. But she's never left. While she hasn't parlayed her dream into wealth, she is living it. ""My dream was to work with historic sunken shipwrecks and with the people who make up that whole field. My fear was being an old person and not having done it."" Retiring on $3,500 a month . It's not like Tedesco doesn't think about the future. She does. She just thinks about it a bit differently. ""I do plan for the future,"" she says, ""but when I'm planning for the future, I'm planning my next project or my next book or the next photography exhibit or whatever the case may be. So, I'm planning. I'm not necessarily planning on how much money I can put away and what it's gonna grow into."" Both Tedesco and Fernandez are driven. It's a work ethic both say may have come from being a part of the baby boomer generation. Working hard was instilled in them early. It came from his parents, Fernandez says. ""I could not say, 'Write me a check for. Can I borrow your credit card for.' No, that never existed. I think that was instilled in both myself and my sister and to this day I will pass it on. You can make it. You have to have that drive that is with you all day long, 24/7. "" Neither Tedesco nor Fernandez have children. He has a second home in North Carolina. She has a small Key West home encased in lush tropical foliage. While they came at it differently, neither Tedesco nor Fernandez gaze into the future with worry. They are happy with their lives. Fernandez says, ""I have no dream of ever retiring. I will be here for as long as I can."" As for Tedesco, ""Well, I have spent a little time in Latin America,"" she says, ""and a Social Security check can go a long way there.""","Tedesco and Fernandez are two baby boomers who are doing what they love .
Both are driven by a work ethic that might stem from being part of the baby boomer generation .
Tedesco doesn't have retirement like Fernandez, but neither want to stop working ."
"(CNN) -- One of the prosecution's final witnesses, Casey Anthony's mother took the stand again Tuesday in her daughter's capital murder trial, breaking into tears from time to time as she discussed items found with the remains of her 2-year-old granddaughter, Caylee. The prosecution plans to rest its case Wednesday, prosecutor Jeff Ashton told Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. The defense was unable to move its first few witnesses, Perry said, and will begin its case Thursday. Cindy Anthony began crying when a photograph of Caylee wearing a shirt reading ""Big trouble comes in small packages"" was introduced into evidence. Previous testimony has suggested that scraps of the shirt were found at the scene along with Caylee's skeletal remains. Cindy Anthony said she did most of the laundry at the home, and ""I don't ever remember seeing that shirt."" She also identified photographs of objects similar to canvas laundry bags she said were in the Anthony home and said that Caylee had a Winnie the Pooh blanket but that she had not seen the blanket since the end of May, before Caylee disappeared. A canvas laundry bag and Winnie the Pooh blanket were found with the little girl's remains. Cindy Anthony's testimony followed that of a long line of investigators and forensic experts, called to the stand in the Orlando courtroom in an effort to support prosecutors' theory that Casey Anthony, 25, killed her daughter by knocking her out with chloroform and putting duct tape over her nose and mouth. They allege she then put the little girl's body in black garbage bags and stored it in her trunk before dumping it in woods near her home. Caylee's skeletal remains were found in December 11, 2008. She was last seen June 16, 2008, but her disappearance was not reported until July 15, 2008, after Cindy Anthony demanded answers from her daughter about Caylee's whereabouts. Anthony faces seven counts in Caylee's death, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. She has pleaded not guilty. Her attorneys have said Caylee was not killed but rather drowned in the family pool on June 16. Defense attorney Jose Baez told jurors that Casey Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked when they discovered the body and covered up her death. George Anthony rejected that scenario in his testimony the first week of the trial. Cindy Anthony testified Tuesday that duct tape was also in the home, stored in the garage, but she could not recall making a previous statement that duct tape was used at a command center after Caylee went missing. Baez pointed out that in a July 2009 deposition, Cindy Anthony was asked whether Casey Anthony had removed any duct tape from the home while out of jail on bond and said she didn't think so, as the family had only one roll and her husband was using it. Cindy Anthony explained that at the time, both she and her husband were using the tape on ""no trespassing"" signs on their property because of protesters outside. The final witness of the day was Bobby Williams, a tattoo artist who applied a tattoo to Casey Anthony -- ""Bella Vita,"" Italian for ""beautiful life"" -- on July 2, during the time Caylee was missing but before her disappearance was reported to police. Williams testified that Anthony did not appear to be upset and did not mention Caylee. He said he spoke to her again July 15, when she came into the shop to make an appointment for herself and a friend for July 19. She mentioned at the time that Caylee was with the nanny but would be with her July 19, Williams said. A host of witnesses including Anthony's former boyfriend, friends and acquaintances have testified that Anthony was not upset and did not mention her missing daughter in the 31 days before police were notified the little girl had disappeared. Anthony told authorities afterward that she had been frantically searching for her daughter during that month. After Williams' testimony, Anthony's defense team moved for a mistrial on several grounds, including the fact that prosecutors asked Williams whether she seemed remorseful, although Perry did not allow Williams to answer. Prosecutor Jeff Ashton countered that the question came in response to Baez's asking Williams whether customers do not often get tattoos to remember departed loved ones. Perry denied the mistrial motion. Defense attorneys said they will move for acquittal when the prosecution rests. Earlier Tuesday, FBI forensic examiner Catherine Theisen said that neither Anthony nor Caylee could be excluded as the source of a hair found in Anthony's trunk. Theisen said she subjected a portion of the hair to mitochondrial DNA testing. Such testing is used, she told jurors, when a specimen such as hair or skeletal remains may not contain enough nuclear DNA for testing. Nuclear DNA, she said, is inherited from both parents and can identify a person to the exclusion of all others. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited from a person's mother, and testing shows whether a person cannot be excluded as the source of evidence -- along with their mother, their siblings and anyone else in the maternal family line. Theisen said she compared the hair portion to cheek swabs from Anthony and found that they matched. She said she would not expect to see that DNA type in more than .26% of the African-American population, 1.85% of the Caucasian population and .39% of the Hispanic population. She also acknowledged that the testing could not exclude Anthony's mother, Cindy Anthony; her brother, Lee Anthony; or any maternal uncles as the source of the hair. Theisen also testified Tuesday that she tested the ""hair mass"" found with Caylee's remains and found that it shared the same mitochondrial DNA type as the hair in the trunk. On cross-examination, Baez attempted to question Theisen, over numerous objections from prosecutors, about whether she was aware that Lee Anthony owned the car before his sister. Theisen said she did not recall seeing the name Lee Anthony in the communications she was given about the case. Cindy Anthony also took the stand Tuesday and told prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick that she has bleached her hair blonde for years. She said that Casey Anthony has also highlighted her hair off and on and that Lee Anthony has always kept his hair short. She said Caylee's hair was never colored or processed. FBI trace evidence examiner Karen Lowe previously testified that a 9-inch piece of hair from the trunk appeared similar to a piece of hair recovered from the little girl's hairbrush and was not similar to Casey Anthony's hair. Cindy Anthony said that it was possible her mother had been in the car and that her hair, a mixture of blonde, brown, white and gray, has been shoulder-length for years. Following Theisen to the stand Tuesday was Alina Burroughs, an Orange County Sheriff's Office crime scene examiner who helped process the scene where Caylee's remains were found and helped execute a search warrant at the Anthony home. Burroughs identified photographs of several sheets of heart-shaped stickers found at the home, as well as the sheets themselves, with some stickers missing. On Monday, an FBI latent print examiner testified that adhesive in the shape of a heart was found on a corner of a piece of duct tape that was covering the mouth portion of Caylee's remains. Elizabeth Fontaine explained the find to jurors by asking them to think about when they remove an adhesive bandage from their skin and some of the adhesive remains in the shape of the bandage. Instead of a bandage, however, the outline was the shape of a heart, she said, and about the size of a dime. A sticker was also found at the site where Caylee's remains were discovered on a small piece of cardboard. An FBI analysis showed that sticker did not match those found at the Anthony home. Asked by Baez whether she found a sticker like that in the home, Burroughs said she did not. Jurors sent a note to Perry on Tuesday asking to see the photograph of the sticker recovered from the crime scene. Perry granted that request but made clear to jurors that the sticker has since separated from the cardboard. Fontaine said Monday that she found the heart-shaped adhesive while examining the three pieces of duct tape found on Caylee's remains for fingerprints. She said she didn't find fingerprints but didn't expect to, given the months the tape and the remains had been outdoors and exposed to the elements. Any oil or sweat from a person's fingertips would have long since deteriorated, she said. Perry told jurors Monday testimony in the case could conclude by the end of next week, although he cannot say for sure. Deliberations could begin by June 25, he said. Roy Kronk, the meter reader who discovered Caylee's remains, has been subpoenaed by the defense, his attorney, David Evans, said Tuesday. He was not given a date to appear in court, Evans said.

"(CNN) -- A single phone call by Osama bin Laden's trusted courier tipped off U.S. officials to his Pakistan compound, ultimately leading to the raid that killed the al Qaeda leader, a senior Pakistani intelligence official told CNN Saturday. The telephone call the courier made was ""not the final one -- it was the initial piece of evidence"" that sparked the focus on the compound in Abbottabad, the official said. Four years ago, U.S. officials uncovered the identity of a trusted bin Laden courier -- later identified as a Kuwaiti named Abu Ahmad -- whom they believed was living with and protecting the al Qaeda leader. The Washington Post, citing U.S. intelligence officials, reported Friday that Americans had intercepted a ""catch-up phone call"" Ahmad took from an old friend. ""This is where you start the movie about the hunt for bin Laden,"" one U.S. official briefed on the intelligence-gathering leading up to the early Monday raid on the compound told the Washington Post. The Pakistani official told CNN the phone call was made by the courier, though he didn't know when. The courier and his brother were among those killed in Monday's raid. In recent days, the materials taken from bin Laden's compound continued to yield a trove of intelligence, including details about a possible attack on the 10th anniversary of 9/11. At a briefing Saturday focusing on the intelligence aspects of the raid, U.S. officials released five videos showing the al Qaeda leader. They were seized at his compound. One video looks like a home movie, a portrait of a graying man watching television, but it is an image that suggests how conscious bin Laden was of his image. The other videos showed him in more formal attire, making remarks, but U.S. officials removed the audio in all five videos. As early as February 2010, al Qaeda members discussed a plan to derail trains in the United States by placing obstructions on tracks over bridges and valleys, the alert said, according to one law enforcement official. The plan was to be executed later this year, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, though no specific rail system was identified, the official said. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed a notice was sent to federal, state, local and tribal authorities. ""We have no information of any imminent terrorist threat to the U.S. rail sector, but wanted to make sure our partners are aware of the alleged plotting. It is unclear if any further planning has been conducted since February of last year,"" spokesman Matt Chandler said. Rail agencies across the United States heightened security. A U.S. official said that ""valuable information has been gleaned already"" from the information gathered at bin Laden's compound, though no specific plots or terrorist suspects were identified. But the material suggests that al Qaeda was particularly interested in striking Washington, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, according to the law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity. U.S. authorities have found that al Qaeda appeared especially interested in striking on significant dates like July 4, Christmas and the opening day of the United Nations. The material seized from the compound included audio and video equipment, suggesting bin Laden may have taped messages there, a U.S. official said. Ten hard drives, five computers and more than 100 storage devices, such as disks and thumb drives, were also found, a senior U.S. official told CNN. Dozens of people in Abbottabad have been arrested because of their suspected connections to the compound where Osama bin Laden was shot and killed, a Pakistani intelligence official said Friday. Investigators want to know whether any of the people are al Qaeda members or sympathizers. The United States and Pakistan have been allies for years in the anti-terrorism effort, but U.S. concerns that Pakistanis haven't been robust enough in the fight against Islamic militants and suspected U.S. drone attacks that killed innocent civilians have heightened tensions. Another suspected drone strike killed 12 suspected militants on Friday in the Pakistani tribal region. Questions remain over why and how Pakistani intelligence officials could not have known bin Laden was hiding out in the city, which is home to a military academy and has a strong military presence. Pakistani armed forces chiefs issued a statement Thursday admitting ""shortcomings in developing intelligence"" on the terrorist leader's presence in the country. The army chief of staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, ""made it very clear that any similar action, violating the sovereignty of Pakistan, will warrant a review on the level of military/intelligence cooperation with the United States,"" the statement said. Since the raid, Pakistan has ordered U.S. military personnel on its territory drawn down to the ""minimum essential"" level, the statement said. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report .","NEW: U.S. officials release five edited videos found at bin Laden's compound .

"(CNN) -- Trying to choose a luxurious spot for the honeymoon of your dreams can be overwhelming. Hawaii, with its tourist-friendly islands and exotic feel without the passport, gets a lot of attention from honeymooners. But there are other scintillating destinations you don't want to overlook in your search. CNN asked Jacqueline Gifford, travel editor of Brides Magazine, for some unforgettable honeymoon ideas. She shared the results from a recent poll of top travel agents from Signature Travel. These are some of their favorite destinations. French Polynesia . In a relaxing contrast to Hawaii's big waves, the blue lagoons of French Polynesia provide calm waters. The French Polynesian islands are also a favorite of celebrities -- Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman honeymooned there as did Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher. Skip the silver, register for a honeymoon . ""It's all about the overwater bungalows,"" Gifford said. ""They have amazing rooms and you're able to jump right off your deck and go snorkeling. Swimming with (reef) sharks is also very popular with young couples."" Tahiti, Bora Bora and Moorea stand out as honeymoon favorites among the nearly 130 islands that make up French Polynesia. It's a haul from any spot in the U.S., but it creates an unforgettable experience for newlyweds. Five spectacular overwater hut resorts . ""It's a once-in-a-lifetime trip,"" Gifford said. ""When we were there, we talked to a few couples and they said, 'This is our honeymoon, we want to do something special and different. We might not ever get back here.' "" Fiji . If you've ever imagined your honeymoon as a secluded escape, Fiji's private island resorts are just what you're looking for. ""It's the ultimate 'Gilligan's Island' fantasy come to life,"" Gifford said. There are a limited number of villas on each island, so it isn't deserted, but seclusion remains a priority. Although staying in one of Laucala Island's 25 villas can cost up to $3,800 a night, the expense is all-inclusive. In other words, requesting five bottles of champagne won't cost you any extra. iReport: Share your scenic destination wedding photos . But with various price ranges for different islands, you can more affordably stay in a beach-front private cottage, or bure (pronounced like ""beret""), Gifford suggested. ""For people who like to be by the water, Fiji's islands are great,"" Gifford said. ""You see other people, but it still feels private -- nothing like a big resort."" Italy . When it comes to romantic honeymoons in Italy, couples tend to think of the Amalfi Coast and Capri, or major cities such as Venice, Florence and Rome. But venturing off into the Tuscan countryside or the northern Lake District makes for equally scenic getaways, Gifford said. While Tuscany is well-traveled, its countryside provides an inviting environment for couples who enjoy exploring during the day and relaxing over a good meal and a bottle of wine at dusk. Lake Como is also a gorgeous destination for honeymooners looking to take in the Italian scenery and culture without the rush of the cities. ""The whole region around the Lake District is beautiful, and I'm not sure people are completely in the know about it,"" Gifford said. Bali . If planning your wedding was a little too hectic, then Bali, the ultimate relaxation destination, is for you. As seen in the movie ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" expect to enjoy a natural getaway in a place where life slows down to take pleasure in the little things. ""Bali is the zen destination,"" Gifford said. ""You're enjoying a blissful culture and looking out over serene rice paddies."" While Bali's beaches provide a nice place to stay, the hills are home to relaxing, isolated retreats. Gifford also recommends taking in some of the spa culture while visiting. Bermuda . Although often associated with the Caribbean, Bermuda is actually situated about 650 miles off the coast of North Carolina. For people living on the East Coast, the plane ride to paradise lasts less than two hours. Travel Snapshots: Bermuda . ""Bermuda has amazing beaches, the pink sands, great food, warm people and all the pampering and nice hotels without having to travel far,"" Gifford said. A small island, Bermuda gives off a close-knit community feel while providing an exotic flavor. Pastel-colored buildings and crystal blue waters give the scenic impression that you're far from home without the long journey. For couples taking a ""mini-moon"" -- and compensating with a longer honeymoon when time allows -- Bermuda provides a special weekend getaway where you can still make it back to work on Monday, Gifford said.","The French Polynesian islands' overwater bungalows are perfect for honeymoons .
Fiji's private island getaways are available in a wide price range .
Bali and the Italian Lake District provide secluded, relaxing spots for honeymooners .

"(CNN)  -- Germany coach Joachim Low has put an end to speculation over his future by signing a two-year contract extension which will keep him at the national side until after the 2014 World Cup. Low -- whose contract was originally due to expire after Euro 2012 --had been linked to the soon-to-be vacant position at Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich, following the news that current boss Louis Van Gaal will step down from the role at the end of the season. However, in a statement on the German Football Federation (DFB) website on Tuesday, Low confirmed that his foreseeable future lay with the national team. ""I am pleased that we were able to agree quickly to a continuation of the cooperation until after the World Cup,"" the 51-year-old former Stuttgart and Fenerbahce boss said. ""We believe that it makes sense to continue along this successful path with the national team. I enjoy this wonderful job and believe in the quality of our players and see good prospects for our team."" Low replaced fellow German Jurgen Klinsmann at the head of the national side in 2006, leading them to the runners-up spot at Euro 2008 and third place finish at the 2010 World Cup. The former under-21 international has admitted that uncertainty over his future overshadowed last year's tournament in South Africa and said he wanted to avoid a repeat of that for the upcoming European competition. The DFB also confirmed that Low's backroom staff -- assistant Hansi Flick, goalkeeping coach Andreas Kopke and team manager Oliver Bierhoff -- have signed new two-year deals. Meanwhile, Bernd Schuster, the German coach of seventh-placed Turkish League club Besiktas has quit following the Istanbul-based side's string of poor results that has seen them claim just one win in their last seven matches. The 51-year-old ex-German international and former Real Madrid boss' side also suffered a humiliating 8-1 defeat to Dynamo Kiev in the last 32 of the Europa League.","Germany coach Joachim Low extends contract until after the 2014 World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Passengers were evacuated from a Delta aircraft after smoke began coming from the wheel area, after it landed at Atlanta's airport Saturday afternoon, a witnesses and company official said. Flight 2284 had just arrived at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport from Pittsburgh, around 4:14 p.m. when the incident occurred, said Delta spokeswoman Leslie Parker. Parker said the plane's brakes overheated, causing smoke. According to Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen, one of the plane's tires blew out. ""After (the plane) landed there was a big boom, and then just a line of smoke,"" Kalel Dunst, who saw the incident from a hotel room nearby, told CNN. ""It turned off the runway, and the fire got a lot bigger."" According to Parker, none of the 44 passengers or five crew members on board were injured. All were safely evacuated and bussed to the terminal. She said they departed the plane by slides, though Bergen said they took the back stairs. The aircraft -- an MD 88 -- will be taken out of service and evaluated, the Delta spokeswoman said.

"Diyarbakir, Turkey (CNN) -- At a campaign rally in the predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan tried Wednesday to draw parallels between the oppression and persecution Turkey's largest ethnic minority has faced and the pressure he himself faced under Turkey's former secularist leaders. ""We went through the same suffering as you,"" Erdogan told a crowd of thousands of people who gathered amid rain and tight security in they city's main square. ""Your brother (Erdogan) was jailed for only reciting a poem. ... I know what the status quo made my Kurdish brothers live through. I come from within this struggle. I know policies of dismissal, I know denial."" Erdogan referred to the six months he spent in jail in the late 1990s when he was the mayor of Istanbul. Turkish authorities imprisoned him after he recited a poem that was ruled to have Islamist connotations. In his speech on Wednesday, Erdogan emphasized ""brotherhood"" with the Kurdish people. For nearly 30 years, southeastern Turkey has been the primary battleground for a guerilla war between Kurdish separatists and the Turkish state that has claimed more than 30,000 mostly Kurdish lives. ""For decades we lived in poverty together. For decades, we lived the pressure, oppression, the fascist oppression of the status quo together. What was banned for you, was also banned for us,"" Erdogan said. Security was tight ahead of Erdogan's speech. The Diyarbakir governor's office issued a written statement announcing security forces confiscated dozens of gasoline bombs as well as ingredients for Molotov cocktails during operations launched before the rally. It said it had had information of ""possible attacks on the security forces, political party election bureaus and party offices with Molotov cocktails, flared, and handmade bombs."" Tensions were raised by clashes that erupted Tuesday during an Erdogan rally in the Black Sea town of Hopa. Diyarbakir has long been a hotbed of support for the Kurdish opposition activists, and intermittent clashes were reported there Wednesday, including one case in which the driver of a large van was pulled onto street after exchanging words with pedestrians. People were subjected to thorough checks before going into the rally, although once inside the mood was jovial, with people praising Erdogan and some women writing notes and giving them to his bodyguards in the hope that they might be passed on to the prime minister. But not far from the rally, in the Kurdish neighborhood of Baglar, almost all of the shops were closed in silent protest against Erdogan. Men on the streets sang political songs and waved flags in support of the Peace and Democracy Party, the main Kurdish political party. Later in the evening Molotov cocktails and other homemade explosives were thrown at police gathered to contain the protests. Fires were quickly put out by heavily armored police trucks and minutes then passed before the next device was thrown. No one was reported hurt in the incidents. In the clashes Tuesday in Hopa, a demonstrator died of a heart attack and one of Erdogan's bodyguards was hospitalized with head wounds after demonstrators hurled stones that struck him as he was riding Erdogan's campaign bus away from Hopa. The demonstrators in Hopa were for the most part members of leftist and secularist groups. Parliamentary elections are to be held in Turkey on June 12. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party is widely expected to once again win a majority of seats in parliament. It first swept to power in 2002. CNN's Ivan Watson and Yesim Comert contributed to this report.","Prime Minister Erdogan says he ""went through the same suffering"" as Kurds .

"(CNN) -- Vietnamese authorities are on alert for animal smugglers after four bags of deadly snakes were found on a train from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, according to local press reports. The bags contained an undetermined number of snakes including some king cobras, the on-line news service VnExpress reported. A guard and a conductor found them while inspecting the train when it made a stop at Quang Ngai railway station on Thursday, the website reported. The guard and conductor were not injured. Passengers panicked when they heard about the snakes, VnExpress said. The snakes, which are protected by law in Vietnam, were handed over to the Quang Ngai forest protection agency on Friday and released into the wild. Some of the snakes weighed more than one kilogram (2.2 pounds) each, said Nguyen Van Han, chief of the forest protection unit. Officials in Quang Ngai will increase patrols and inspection the North-South railway, roads and restaurants to prevent the smuggling of wild animals, according toTuoitrenews, an online publication of a Vietnamese newspaper. The king cobra is the world's longest venomous snake with a length up to 13 feet (4 meters) according to New York's Bronx Zoo, which had an Egyptian cobra escape earlier this year. That cobra was found in the zoo's reptile house a week after it escaped from its enclosure.","Four bags of venomous cobras are found on a train bound for Hanoi, local press reports say .

"(CNN) -- Former Manchester City manager Mark Hughes has resigned as coach of English club Fulham amid reports linking him with the vacant job at Aston Villa. Hughes has only been in charge at Craven Cottage for a season, joining the London-based club seven months after he was sacked by City. He led Fulham to eighth place in the English Premier League last season and the club qualified for UEFA's Europa League competition due to their standing in Europe's fair play table. Hughes said he wanted a new challenge but insisted he hadn't been approached by any other club. In a statement he said: ""I hope the supporters and all those connected with the club will understand I wish to move on to further my experiences. ""I would also like to take this opportunity to clarify that neither myself nor my representative have approached or have been approached by another club. This decision to leave Fulham has not been influenced by any outside party."" Hughes, a former Manchester United and Barcelona striker, spent 18 months in charge at Manchester City, as the club were taken over by Abu Dhabi billionaire Sheikh Mansour, who has since spent around $1bn. But Hughes was dismissed in December 2009 after a slump in league performances before he returned to the game to coach Fulham -- a job he claims he has done well. ""I would like to thank the chairman, directors, players and fans of Fulham Football Club for their support over the last 12 months and wish them every success in the future,"" he added. ""I believe my management team and I have done a good job and the club has a strong foundation from which they can go forward. ""I sincerely wish Fulham a successful campaign in the Europa League next season and for their continued progress on and off the field."" A statement on Fulham's official web site confirmed that Hughes had left the club. It read: ""Fulham Football Club can confirm that Mark Hughes has provided notice, under the terms of his contract, to leave the club at the end of June.

"(CNN) -- When looking at the world's lowest unemployment rates, one of the first things you might notice is that many of the countries are in Southeast Asia. Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam all have unemployment rates at or below 3%, ranking them in the top six overall, according to tradingeconomics.com. ""One reason why the unemployment rates in those countries are low is because they're starting to get a lot of investment that used to go to China and would have gone to China,"" said George T. Haley, a professor of marketing and international business at the University of New Haven and co-author of ""New Asian Emperors: The Business Strategies of the Overseas Chinese."" Haley said high wage inflation in China has prompted companies to start outsourcing to other countries instead. But investing in Southeast Asia is far from a new thing in the corporate world. ""The U.S., in its policies back during the Vietnam War, encouraged and gave actual subsidies to companies that would source from Southeast Asia because they wanted to use the investment to combat the spread of communism,"" Haley said. ""And over time, it just became a good place to invest. You had relatively low cost of labor ... you had investment support from the U.S. government, and you had the growing economy, which just fed on itself."" Speaking of the U.S., its unemployment rate is 9.2%, which ranks it close to the bottom among the countries on our table of 67 countries. While business is definitely booming in Southeast Asia, take its unemployment numbers with a grain of salt. Many countries define unemployment differently, so it's sometimes difficult to accurately compare rates from different regions. It's also important to note that the table above shows only unemployment rates that have been released since December 2010. Many countries are not on this list because they haven't released their rates in years, if at all. So while the table shows that Angola and South Africa are last on the list at 25%, they are likely far from the world's worst. The latest CIA World Factbook has estimated unemployment rates for most of these missing countries, and eight of them are above 50%. Zimbabwe might have a jobless rate as high as 95%. Other notable countries on the table: . *** America's unemployment rate is well behind its nearest neighbors, Mexico (5.2%) and Canada (7.4%). *** One of the roots of the so-called Arab Spring has been the lack of jobs, especially for young people in the Mideast and North Africa. Tunisia, the first government to fall, had an unemployment rate of 13% one month before its revolution. Egypt's rate was just under 12% in March. Morocco, another country in North Africa experiencing unrest, reported a rate of 9.1%.  *** Some of the highest rates on the list come from three countries that have recently received bailouts from the European Union. Ireland and Greece are both above 14%, while Portugal is just a few points behind at 12.4%. But it's Spain, at 21.3%, that has the highest unemployment rate in the EU.","Jobs appear to be plentiful in many Southeast Asian countries .
One of the reasons, an expert says, is that China -- not just the West -- is outsourcing there .
The United States' jobless rate is higher than the rates in Canada and Mexico ."
"(CNN) -- Opener Tillakaratne Dilshan scored a superb century as Sri Lanka forced their way back on the second day of the first Test against India in Ahmedabad. Dilshan smashed 112 and featured in solid partnerships with fellow-opener Tharanga Paranavitana (35) and captain Kumar Sangakkara (31) as Sri Lanka completed a day of dominance. Fast bowler Zaheer Khan opened a window of opportunity for the hosts by snaring Dilshan and Sangakkara in successive overs in the final session, but Mahela Jayawardene (36 not out) and Thilan Samaraweera, five from a half-century, denied the home side further inroads as Sri Lanka ended on 275 for three, 151 in deficit. Zaheer had looked menacing with the new ball, but with little assistance from the pitch, Sri Lanka were off to a good start and Dilshan looked comfortable. Together with left-handed Paranavitana, Dilshan added 74 for the opening wicket at a brisk pace, effectively putting the pressure back on the home side. Ishant Sharma eventually severed that stand, forcing Paranavitana to fend at a delivery that moved away a touch and he edged to wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni who held an excellent catch in front of first slip. Save for that burst from Zaheer with the new ball, India's attack had looked ordinary and it allowed Sangakkara to hit his stride. With the Sri Lankan skipper holding up one end, Dilshan continued to play freely and eventually reached his 10th Test hundred -- his fifth this year -- by cutting leg-spinner Ishant for a boundary. The two had added 115 for the second wicket when Zaheer produced another fine burst to snare both batsmen. Dilshan was tempted with a short ball, but mistimed his pull and ended up presenting Rahul Dravid a simple catch at gully. Sangakkara was also done by a short ball, the captain top edging to Sachin Tendulkar at fine leg. The twin dismissal left Sri Lanka at 194 for three, but Mahela and Samaraweera put the visitors' pursuit back on track. Both batsmen began cautiously until Samaraweera, who has already scored 1083 runs in eight Tests in this calendar year, shed the shackles by driving Mishra for consecutive boundaries. The fourth-wicket pair have so far added 81 in an unbroken stand. In the morning, master spinner Muttiah Muralitharan finished with three wickets as the hosts were bowled out in the first session. Muralitharan, who had snared Yuvraj on Monday, added the wickets of tailenders Harbhajan Singh and Ishant to his tally, while fast bowler Chanaka Welegedara removed Dravid, the batsman falling without adding to his overnight score of 177. Dravid fell in the third over of the morning, Welegedara collecting his fourth wicket by bowling the batsman via an inside edge as he attempted to drive. Harbhajan, two overnight, then added 25 for the eighth wicket with Zaheer taking India's total past the 400-run mark in the process. But Sri Lanka's spinners made short work of the tail. Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath trapped Zaheer in front, while Muralitharan claimed the wickets of Harbhajan and last man Ishant to finish with a three-wicket haul.","Opener Tillakaratne Dilshan scores a superb century for Sri Lanka against India .

"(CNN) -- Sales of a drug widely used by poultry producers on their flocks will be suspended because a study found the livers of chickens given the drug contain inorganic arsenic -- a cancer-causing agent. ""We would like to stress that the levels of inorganic arsenic were very low, representing a very low health risk to people who eat chicken,"" said Dr. Bernadette Dunham, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine, in a Wednesday conference call with reporters. The drug, called 3-Nitro (Roxarsone), contains organic arsenic and has been used by poultry producers since 1944. Alpharma, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., will suspend the sales voluntarily in the United States, the FDA said. A company spokesman would not say how profitable the drug is. The announcement that the FDA plans to suspend U.S. sales of the drug came after an FDA study of 100 broiler chickens detected inorganic arsenic at higher levels in the livers of those treated with 3-Nitro than in those who did not get the drug. Inorganic arsenic causes cancer in humans. That increase concerns ""a very low but completely avoidable exposure to a carcinogen,"" said Michael R. Taylor, FDA deputy commissioner for foods. Pfizer plans to continue selling the product for the maximum allowed 30 more days in the United States. ""The company stated that allowing sales for this period will provide time for animal producers to transition to other treatment strategies and will help ensure that animal health and welfare needs are met,"" the FDA said in a news release. Dr. David Goldman, assistant administrator of the Office of Public Health Science at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service, said the risk to consumers posed by continuing to eat chicken given the drug during the phaseout period was ""very low."" The FDA's study was carried out after other studies indicated that organic arsenic could transform into the more dangerous inorganic form, the FDA said. Pfizer, in a statement on its website, equated the average levels of inorganic arsenic in poultry tissue with those found in an 8-ounce glass of drinking water. The product is also sold in Canada, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Venezuela, Brazil, Australia, Pakistan and Jordan. Asked whether the company would continue selling 3-Nitro abroad, a Pfizer scientist said the company was informing other countries' regulatory systems of the U.S. action but did not say that sales would be suspended. ""We'll work under their regulatory systems to take the appropriate action,"" said Dr. Scott Brown, senior director for metabolism and safety, veterinarian medical research and development for Pfizer Animal Health. The drug is used primarily in broiler chickens to help control a parasitic disease called coccidiosis and ""for weight gain, feed efficiency and improved pigmentation,"" the FDA said. Richard Lobb, a spokesman for the National Chicken Council, said the drug is widely used but not universally so. ""This is the treatment of choice,"" he said. Though it is not administered to organic chickens, they represent only about 1% of the 8.7 billion broilers produced each year in the United States, he said. The average American eats 85 pounds of chicken per year, Lobb said. A telephone receptionist for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association said no one was available for comment.","Study found that the livers of chickens given the drug contained low levels of a carcinogen .
Suspension does not kick in for 30 days .
Pfizer says that delay will give time for producers to transition to other treatment strategies, according to the FDA ."
"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The first stage of the NATO handover to Afghan security forces began Sunday, marked with a ceremony at a police station in Afghanistan's Bamiyan province -- a small relatively stable area situated in the country's mountainous central region. Bamiyan -- where New Zealand troops are serving -- is the first of seven areas to transfer security responsibilities, said Seddiq Seddiqi, an Interior Ministry spokesman. ""There is no particular security problem here in Bamyan,"" said provincial spokesman Abdul Rahman Ahmadi. ""The only challenge that we worry about will be the interferences of the insurgents from Bayman's surrounding provinces."" The other six provinces to be transferred include parts of Herat, Balkh, Panjshir, Kabul, Laghman and Helmand. A handover in Lashkar Gah -- Helmand's provincial capital -- is set for Wednesday. Helmand province is home to the small farming community of Marjah, where thousands of NATO and Afghan troops launched a massive offensive that drove  Taliban forces from the area, despite fierce  resistance and heavy losses. Sunday's ceremony in Bamiyan came a day after a series of Afghan-led raids targeting Taliban leaders in the country's southern and eastern regions. The ensuing firefights left more than 10 insurgents dead in Nangarhar province, while government forces captured weapons and supplies in Khost and Logar provinces, NATO reported. ""Militants were hidden in a school"" and opened fire on government forces, said Nangarhar provincial spokesman Ahmad Zia Abdulzai. The spokesman said Afghan forces returned fire on the empty school, as NATO airstrikes pummeled the building. CNN can not independently verify Abdulzai's account. Currently, there are 150,000 ISAF forces in Afghanistan, including nearly 100,000 from the United States -- the largest NATO presence in the region since the U.S.-led war began in 2001. News of the transfers have raised questions about the country's future. While some welcome the transition, critics question whether the country's security forces can repel a resurgent militancy without the same levels of foreign intervention. Last week, the first batch of U.S. soldiers left Afghanistan, beginning a drawdown of 10,000 American troops scheduled to leave by year's end. The full NATO drawdown is expected to take place by the end of 2014. Sunday's transfer ceremony came as Gen. David Petraeus -- the outgoing top commander of the NATO forces in Afghanistan -- prepared to formally transfer authority on Monday to incoming commander Marine Lt. Gen. John Allen. Petraeus plans to retire from the military before taking over operations as the head of the CIA. CNN's Reshad Fazel and Matiullah Mati contributed to this report .","Bamiyan province is the first province to transfer security responsibilities .

"(CNN) -- Argentina striker Sergio Aguero may have scored two goals as a second-half substitute on his Manchester City debut, but the club's manager Roberto Mancini maintained the 23-year-old has yet to regain his full fitness. City opened their English Premier League campaign on Monday with a 4-0 victory over top-flight newcomers Swansea City, with Aguero netting a brace after replacing Nigel de Jong on 60 minutes. Italian coach Mancini said Aguero, who joined City from Atletico Madrid for a club-record fee in July, was short of peak fitness because of his appearances for Argentina at the recent Copa America. ""I think he needs more training,"" Mancini, 46, told the Citizen's official web site. ""He's trained for only one week with the team. I think he needs to recover after the Copa America because I don't think he's 100%."" Aguero double in Manchester City debut . City took the lead through Bosnia's Edin Dzeko after 57 minutes, before Aguero scored his first when he swept home a Micah Richards cross from close range 11 minutes later. The former Independiente forward then assisted Spain's David Silva for City's third goal, before completing the scoring with a stunning 25-yard strike in injury time. ""A better debut than this I don't think is possible,"" reflected Mancini. ""He played 30 minutes, scored two goals, two important goals which closed the match."" Mancini said it was important for the team to bounce back after they surrendered a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 against cross-city rivals Manchester United in the Community Shield, a preseason friendly that starts the English football season. ""I'm very happy for the supporters because after the Community Shield it was important to start the season very well. ""Silva, Aguero, Dzeko, Yaya Toure all played very, very well. But I think all the team started the season very well.""

"(CNN) -- Football officials and players will hold last minute talks Friday to avert a strike that could see the start of the Spanish football season postponed for the first time in 27 years.  Representatives of the Spanish Football League (LFP) and the Spanish Footballers' Association (AFE) will make a final attempt to avoid a shut out, called due to the growing issue of unpaid wages. If an agreement can't be reached, Spain's footballers will go on strike from Friday to Monday, effectively canceling the start of both the first and second divisions. Barcelona and Real Madrid will be the highest profile casualties of the postponement. ""We have made clear that all the players support the players' association,"" Barcelona striker David Villa told the Associated Press. ""If a solution is not found, we won't play."" The disagreement stems from Spain's bankruptcy laws, which allow for the payment of wages to be delayed like any other debt. Six teams in Spain's top flight are currently under bankruptcy protection with the AFE dealing with the cases of over 200 players owed close to $72 million. There has been almost universal support from players and coaches within the Spanish game. When CNN spoke to former Danish international Michael Laudrup, who is now in charge of La Liga side Majorca, he pointed to the discrepancies between the riches of Barcelona, Real Madrid and the rest of Spanish football. ""Not everything is Barca and Real Madrid here in Spain,"" he told CNN's World Sport. ""There are a lot of players not earning so much money and, of course, if they don't pay you in twelve months, well, you have to get a loan from the bank."" ""I think it's ok what the players are doing now."" If agreement can't be reached Friday morning, the strike will go ahead as planned and the start of the Spanish season will be delayed for the first time since 1984.","A proposed players' strike could postpone the start of the Spanish season .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghanistan's acting central bank governor says the country's second largest private lender is not in crisis, warning outspoken lawmakers -- who claim the bank is in trouble -- against spreading fear among its account holders. ""Azizi Bank was neither facing any crisis before, (and) is not facing (a crisis) now."" Mohebullah Safi told CNN. ""Many Afghans have accounts... and we shouldn't panic the people, which could affect our national interest."" Safi, who addressed parliament earlier this week at the request of lawmakers, said the central bank is investigating investment problems with Azizi Bank, but noted that its $588 million in reserves are safe. He added that officials are working to change the country's banking laws to better monitor investments made by Afghan banks and their partners both domestically and abroad. But Afghan parliament member Haji Zaher Qader claimed share holders tried bribe him to keep quiet over the bank's lending practices. ""They offered me a million dollars that I keep silent and not to talk about (the) Azizi Bank crisis, but I refused their offer,"" he told CNN. Qader would not elaborate as to who offered him the alleged bribe or provide specifics about banking practices that are a cause of concern. Still, lawmakers have called for a forensic audit of the bank's finances in an effort to prevent a similar scandal to last year's massive fraud at the country's largest private lender, Kabul Bank. More than $900 million in loans went missing from Kabul Bank, many of them interest-free and made without proper documentation, no collateral or repayment plans. The recipients allegedly used the loans to finance lavish lifestyles outside Afghanistan, triggering a crisis that threatened a collapse of the entire Afghan financial system. It also exposed widespread corruption throughout the Afghan banking sector. Kabul Bank handled salary payments for thousands of Afghan soldiers, police and public workers and was reported to have held up to $1 billion in deposits belonging to Afghan citizens.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Israel's foreign minister Tuesday denied that an American-Israeli law student being held as a spy in Egypt worked for Israeli intelligence. Avigdor Lieberman has no idea why Ilan Grapel, 27, should be detained, he told Israel Radio. Grapel was apprehended Sunday and ordered held for 15 days on suspicion of spying for Israel, said Adel Saeed, a spokesman for Egypt's general prosecutor. Grapel was taken into custody in a five-star hotel in downtown Cairo, Saeed said Sunday. Grapel's mother said he had been staying at a $9-a-night youth hostel. Israeli diplomats visited Grapel on Tuesday, according to Egypt's Israeli embassy, and found him to be in good health. Israel continues working for Grapel's release, the embassy said. Grapel's mother denied Monday that her son was involved in espionage, saying: ""Law students don't have time to be spies."" ""There is no chance he's a spy,"" Irene Grapel said from her home in New York. Her son, a former paratrooper in the Israel Defense Forces, holds dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship. He worked briefly for St. Andrew's Refugee Services in Cairo, said its assistant director Fiona Cameron. ""Ilan Grapel worked for us for four days last week. We were unaware of his dual citizenship or of his military record,"" she told CNN Tuesday, saying he had been ""thoroughly vetted before he came, though obviously not thoroughly enough."" The organization had ""no reason to be suspicious of his activities"" for the four days he'd been with them, she said. She learned of Grapel's detention from his friends when she called them to ask why he hadn't shown up for work, she said. Cameron said St. Andrew's had been ""pro-actively in touch with the Egyptian authorities"" about his case. St. Andrew's Refugee Services seeks to help ""the isolated and vulnerable refugee communities in Egypt to come together for empowerment, education, community development and social services,"" according to its website. Grapel is a rising third-year student at Emory University School of Law in Atlanta, school officials said Monday in a statement. ""We are in touch with his family and are working with them to provide support and assistance,"" it said. He is involved in the Emory Public Interest Committee as well as Emory Law's Pro Bono program, working with Student Legal Services, it said. He traveled May 10 to Cairo to volunteer at St. Andrews, his mother said. Though Grapel was working without pay, he received a public-service grant from Emory, which has no link to the organization, his mother said. Grapel's IDF work could have been what led Egyptian authorities to focus on him, his mother said. ""He loves the Arab culture. He loves the Arab religion,"" she said. Grapel speaks Arabic, which he studied at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and he spent his junior year at Ben Gurion University in Israel. ""He gravitates toward Arabic-speaking students on campus so he can speak with them, simply to use the language,"" Irene Grapel said. She said she spoke Monday morning with her son, who told her he was being held at a security center in Cairo. Saeed, the general prosecutor spokesman, said Grapel had participated in the Lebanon war of 2006 and was relieved of field combat duties after being injured. Investigators had been following his activities for months, Saeed said. The Israeli government allegedly sent Grapel to Egypt after the January 25 revolution to take advantage of the security vacuum that then existed by recruiting others to provide the Israelis with military and political information, Saeed said. The revolution forced former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak from power; he stepped down February 11. The suspect, who was present at most of the protests, tried to incite sectarian violence between Muslims and Christians and encouraged demonstrators to engage in violence against the military, Saeed said. His goal was to foment chaos between the Egyptian people and the military, Saeed said. The supreme state security prosecutor has questioned Grapel, and the general prosecutor will announce the results of the investigation when it is complete, Saeed said. Egyptian newspapers carried the story on their front pages Monday alongside photos of Grapel republished from his Facebook account. ""Egypt arrests Israeli Intelligence Officer, a big blow to the Israeli Mossad Intelligence Agency,"" one headline said. Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979. The United States has been granted consular access to Grapel and is following the investigation to determine the exact charges, the State Department said Monday. ""We've confirmed that he was in good health, Mr. Grapel's family is aware of his arrest, and refer you to the government of Egypt for details on the charges against him,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday. The Egyptian authorities provided the United States with ""almost immediate consular access"" to Grapel, Toner said.  ""Our function, as they would in that case of any American citizen held overseas, is to provide them with consular services, work with local authorities to make sure he's being treated fairly under local law, provide information about the local legal system and facilitate communication with his family and friends.""

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony's white Pontiac Sunbird is a crushed slab in a Florida junkyard, nearly seven weeks after she was acquitted of murder in her 2-year-old daughter's death, according a person in a law office close to the case. An assistant in the office of Mark Lippman -- who represents George and Cindy Anthony, who owned the car before giving it to their daughter, Casey -- said Friday that the car was destroyed a day earlier. The assistant declined to be named. That the vehicle had been crushed was first reported and documented by Florida TV station WOFL. The car, and the odor emanating from its trunk, had been central to the prosecution's case in Anthony's murder trial. On June 27, 2008, she abandoned the Pontiac at an Orlando business, saying it had run out of gas, according to testimony. It later was towed to a wrecker yard, where it remained until July 15 of that year, when George and Cindy Anthony got a letter from the yard and went to pick up the car. Several witnesses, including a tow yard employee and George Anthony, said there was a vile smell coming from car's trunk. The prosecution alleged -- and expert witnesses testified -- that the odor was that of human decomposition. They claimed Casey Anthony duct-taped her daughter's mouth and nose to suffocate her, and then put the body in the Pontiac's trunk before disposing of it. But the defense rebutted these claims, with attorney Jose Baez blasting what he called ""the state's fantasy of forensics"" in his closing argument. Defense attorneys maintained the child, Caylee, drowned in the Anthony's above-ground pool on June 16, and that Casey Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. George Anthony denied that in his testimony. Baez claimed a ""phantom stain"" in the trunk should have included more in the way of DNA evidence. He said the state used ""junk science"" relating to the odor and stain in the Pontiac's trunk to reach its conclusions. After Anthony was cleared on the murder charge -- and convicted on four lesser counts of misleading law enforcement -- alternate juror Russell Huekler told HLN that he had a difficult time accepting that Caylee's body had been in the car trunk.

"(CNN) -- Peru will face either Argentina or Uruguay in the Copa America semifinals after claiming a shock 2-0 last eight victory over Colombia on Saturday. After a goalless 90 minutes, Peru scored the opening goal 11 minuites into extra time when Carlos Lobaton reacted first to fire the ball home after goalkeeper Luis Martinez fumbled an attempted punched clearance. And they sealed their victory six minutes into the second period when Paolo Guerrero set Juan Vargas free on the counter-attack -- and the Fiorentina star drilled home the decisive second goal. Colombia went into the match as firm favorites to progess after winning their group ahead of Argentina, while Peru scraped through as a best third-placed finisher from the group section. However, they missed a host of chances to win the match in extra time, notably when highly-rated Porto striker Radamel Falcao fired a penalty wide. Dayro Moreno hit the post and Fredy Guarin the crossbar as Colombia did everything but score during regulation time. And they were made to pay for those misses as Peru netted twice in extra time to reach the semifinals for the first time since 1997.","Peru shock Colombia 2-0 top reach the semifinals of the Copa America .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Even though a Peruvian judge postponed a preliminary hearing for Joran van der Sloot Wednesday, it still was a dramatic day in court for the father of the young woman van der Sloot is accused of killing. Ricardo Flores said Wednesday was the first time he saw the alleged killer of his daughter face to face. ""It was a very tough moment,"" he told CNN shortly after leaving a courtroom inside Lima's Castro Castro prison, noting that it seemed van der Sloot was enjoying many privileges. ""I thought I'd see someone skinny ... but no, he was fatter than when he first went to prison."" The judge rescheduled the closed-door hearing -- which involves some evidence in the case -- for next Tuesday, because van der Sloot did not have legal representation in the courtroom Wednesday, Flores said. His daughter, Stephany Flores, was found dead in a Lima hotel room registered to van der Sloot in May 2010. Police say van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. Earlier this month, van der Sloot's defense attorney, Maximo Altez, resigned, citing unspecified differences in strategy. If van der Sloot does not have an attorney next week, the judge said he would appoint one, Flores said. The 23-year-old van der Sloot was once the prime suspect in the disappearance in Aruba of American Natalee Holloway, who vanished at age 18 while on a graduation trip. He was arrested twice but never charged in connection with her disappearance. Shortly after his 2010 arrest, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges that he tried to extort $250,000 from the Holloway family. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Natalee Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. Peruvian authorities have yet to file formal charges against van der Sloot. Once the discovery phase of the case ends, prosecutors will file charges and a trial date will be set. It could be weeks before the Peruvian trial begins. Ricardo Flores said the family hoped van der Sloot would be charged with robbery and homicide, which would carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. Before his resignation from the case, Altez told In Session his client attacked Flores after she found something on his computer that tied him to Holloway. He gave In Session a copy of a motion he filed asking that van der Sloot face a lesser charge for a crime of passion. ""My client ... admits having murdered the victim, but not with ferocity, for profit or pleasure, nor any of the other element(s) that make up this murder, but only by violent emotion that overtook him at the time he was attacked by the victim,"" the motion read. However, Ricardo Flores and Edward Alvarez, an attorney representing the Flores family, argued that a police investigation indicated the last time anyone had searched for information about Holloway on van der Sloot's computer was the day before Flores' death -- suggesting the attorney's explanation that van der Sloot attacked Flores after she read an e-mail on his computer was a lie. ""That hypothesis has already been defeated,"" Ricardo Flores said Wednesday. Despite the latest delay in the case, he said he was confident that justice would prevail, and that he would be able to face van der Sloot in court again. ""I am confident that God will give me the strength,"" he said. In Session's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","Ricardo Flores says Wednesday was the first time he saw van der Sloot face-to-face .

"(CNN) -- Talk show queen Oprah Winfrey took her final bow in a taped episode that aired Wednesday, marking the end of her 25-year daytime talk show with a tearful goodbye. ""You all have been a safe harbor for me,"" Winfrey told her audience. ""My hope is that you will be that safe harbor for someone else."" The media mogul signed off by walking through her audience and offering an e-mail address -- oprah@oprah.com -- by which her many fans may contact her. ""I want you to know that what you have to say matters to me,"" she said, pledging to read as many e-mails as possible. Minute-by-minute blog of Wednesday's show . The final ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" audience included her boyfriend, Stedman Graham, filmmaker Tyler Perry and her fourth-grade teacher, a woman she called Mrs. Duncan. Winfrey said she has no regrets, though wished she could have done more to combat sexual predators of children. She then turned to Perry, who sat beside 200 other men in the audience who were once victims of sexual abuse as children. ""They are standing together to lift the veil of shame,"" she said. Each man carried a photo of himself as a child. Photos: Oprah through the years . In the end, Winfrey said her departure isn't bittersweet, but rather ""all sweet and no bitter."" ""Every single day I came down from my makeup room, I'd offer a prayer of gratitude for the opportunity to have done this work. To be embraced by all of you, it's one of the greatest honors a human being can have,"" she said. ""Many of us have been together for 25 years. ... So I thank you all for your support and trust in me. I thank you for tuning in every day. ... I won't say good-bye, I'll just say, until we meet again."" Beyond her studio audience, people like Funda Ray also reminisced about how Winfrey turned her daytime talk show into a televised forum for self-help. When Ray arrived on these shores two decades ago from her native Turkey, she hardly spoke English. But she learned, went to school and even college. Today, she works as a financial adviser's assistant. And she said it's all because of Oprah. ""She inspired me so much,"" said Ray, 44, of Hibbing, Minnesota. ""If it wasn't for her, I would have sat at home."" Gayle King: ""Oprah was so ready for this moment"" Ray was recording the last episode of Oprah Winfrey's show Wednesday -- she couldn't be home in time to watch. ""I'm going to miss her so much,"" she said. The talk show queen capped three days of farewell broadcasts that included appearances by Hollywood's top celebrities. Winfrey announced in 2009 that she was leaving the show that catapulted her into a household name and made her a part of American culture and a worldwide celebrity. Even Ray's mother, who arrived from Istanbul for a U.S. visit last week, got off the plane and asked her daughter: ""Do you know Oprah is retiring?"" Winfrey's popularity and credibility go hand in hand: If she gushed about a book, it became an instant best-seller. An appearance on her show was almost always followed by a rise in profile for the guest. Paula Pervall, 44, administrative assistant at the Elmhurst House of Friendship, an assisted living home in Wheeling, West Virginia, is among millions of Oprah fans. Oprah fans hold viewing parties . ""I think that it's sad that the up-and-coming generation is not going to be able to experience what she offered my generation -- the self-help, the inspiration to do better,"" Pervall said. ""She was very inspiring to people. She taught a lot of lessons."" The most important lesson? ""To be the best me that I can be,"" she said. Oprah has had many great people on the show, Pervall said. She remembers the woman who had the face transplant; she was from West Virginia -- ""that one jumps out at me."" Another show featured someone kicked out of a West Virginia town because of HIV. Winfrey taped the teary finale last week that included surprise tributes from superstars including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Aretha Franklin, Michael Jordan, Will Smith and Madonna. The finale aired in three parts starting Monday and featured -- one by one -- dozens of Winfrey's famous friends taking to the stage to pay tribute to the talk show host at Chicago's United Center. Show producers kept her out of the loop about the guests. iReporters weigh in on Oprah's impact and legacy . Winfrey, who has in the past made it clear that she does not like surprises, gasped as her celebrity friends made appearances to thunderous applause, sometimes after a clue phrase. ""Pulling off this surprise has been mission impossible,"" Hanks said Monday, a nod to the famous movie starring Cruise, who walked on stage right after. Winfrey took in the scene in an arena filled with giant photographs of memorable show moments and thousands of adoring admirers. Winfrey had kept mum about plans for the final show, leaving her fans with one last surprise. Kathy Pittman, 55, of Columbus, Ohio, won't find out until Saturday. She'll be watching it with her daughter then, after the work week is over. For Pittman, who is African-American, Winfrey transcended racial barriers with her talk show. She first connected with Winfrey just months after the debut of ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" when the host visited Forsyth County, Georgia, a hotbed of racial tensions at the time. Pittman was intrigued by Winfrey's courage and her confidence to put herself in the middle of a volatile situation. Opinion: There will never be another Oprah . ""No one sees her as a black woman,"" Pittman said. ""She appeals to everyone. She showed us ... that you can do whatever you want to, that the sky's the limit."" It was refreshing to see an African-American woman rise to such enormous power and then use it to help heal the world, said Sondra Miller, 33, vice president of community engagement for Cleveland's rape crisis center. ""I think Oprah has built credibility over the years,"" said Miller, a subscriber to Winfrey's magazine and viewer of her show from childhood. ""She takes topics with an extreme amount of stigma, like sexual abuse, and makes people OK to talk about it."" Male survivors of sexual abuse was one such topic, Miller said. Winfrey interviewed actor, director and producer Tyler Perry about his own experience and had an audience filled with such survivors. Miller thought that was remarkable. ""I don't think we ever could have imagined that happening 10 years ago,"" she said. Miller was drawn to Winfrey's knack for approaching intimidating topics in a sensitive and empowering manner. For many of her fans, Winfrey's last show was history in the making. Her show will end, they said, but her legacy is lasting. Part of it will live on through runner Raymond Britt, 50, who first saw Winfrey at the Chicago Marathon in 1994. He had never run a race before, let alone a marathon. There was so much behind him but so far to go still -- five miles to the finish line. At mile 21, he caught a glimpse of Winfrey, who had just run the Marine Corps Marathon, cheering on the runners. She stood alone, without an entourage, simply encouraging everyone to keep going. ""If she could do it, then I could do it,"" thought Britt, of Winnetka, Illinois. He finished that day and went on to run 125 more races, including 85 marathons. ""It's possible I wouldn't have finished that first one without Oprah at the 21,"" he said. ""She inspires the human race."" And part of it will live on through Britney Deatherage, 26, of Lexington, Kentucky, who watched the shows with her mother and became a fan. The topics were more than current events, said Deatherage, a hairdresser. They focused on ""people's real lives and what they experienced."" ""She's just kind of like an idol to every woman,"" she said, illustrating that ""women can be what they want to be."" Winfrey is one of the most recognizable talk show hosts and has built a media empire, including launching her own cable television network, OWN. ""My vision for OWN is to create a network that inspires our viewers and makes them want to be who they are on their best day,"" Winfrey said. As Winfrey devotees mourn the end of her 25-year run, some speculate who -- if anyone -- can fill her void. Some already have a leg up on the competition. ""I've spent seven to eight years training at Oprah University,"" joked Mehmet ""Dr. Oz"" Oz, a Winfrey protege whose show will upgrade to 83 time slots and stations where ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" had aired. Oz added that he is grateful for the opportunity to take over the time slot, which is among the most sought-after in TV land. Winfrey's show made people like Dominique Taylor, 23, of Brooklyn reorient their lives. Taylor rescheduled her cheerleading practice, her voice lessons, everything around 4 p.m. so that she could be home in front of the television. Winfrey made the young woman laugh, made her cry. Today, Taylor sees herself as an embodiment of Winfrey's show, another part of her legacy. She's a young filmmaker who hopes to involve Winfrey's production company in her project. ""Her show was a platform for so many people to tell their story, for them to know they weren't alone,"" Taylor said. At 4 p.m. every day, Taylor, like millions of others, felt that she mattered.

"(CNN) -- A reactor at Japan's Ohi nuclear plant will be shut down following problems with an emergency cooling system, Kansai Electric said Saturday. The move follows an emergency alarm late Friday triggered when the pressure dropped in the tank for the cooling system, company spokesperson Masaki Todatake said. Pressure returned to normal within about an hour after an injection of liquid nitrogen, but engineers plan to manually stop the No. 1 reactor at the Ohi plant in Fukui Prefecture to carry out a full inspection,Todatake said. It is not known how soon the reactor might start operating again, the company said, but there is no danger of radiation leak. The reactor's closure leaves only 18 of Japan's 54 nuclear plants producing electricity, worsening power supply problems following March's earthquake and tsunami. The 15-meter (48-foot) tsunami inundated Japan's coastal Fukushima Daiichi power plant, leading to a triple meltdown, the aftermath of which Tokyo Electric Power Co. engineers are still struggling to manage. The disaster has caused Japan to rethink its commitment to nuclear energy.

"(CNN) -- South Africans gathered at a stadium Saturday for the funeral service of a woman considered the mother of the nation's liberation struggle. Albertina Sisulu, 92, died at her home last week. Crowds gathered at a football stadium in Soweto for the service, which follows a week of national mourning. Flags were flown at half mast in the nation and its overseas consulates during the mourning period. ""One of the most steadfast, dignified and disciplined pillars of our struggle has fallen,"" said South African President Jacob Zuma, who attended the funeral. ""An era has ended."" Sisulu was married to anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu, who was imprisoned for decades with former South African President Nelson Mandela. In his book, ""Long Walk to Freedom,"" Mandela says the couple's home was ""a mecca for activists"" during the fight against apartheid. ""It was a warm (and) welcoming place,"" he says, and describes her as having ""a wise and wonderful presence."" But the woman affectionately called ""Ma Sisulu"" was also an icon in her own right. She helped nurture a new generation of leaders in between detention periods that included a 1963 seizure by the apartheid government that led to a solitary confinement for weeks South African officials said, . Sisulu would take to the streets as soon as she was freed to rally against the trials of anti-apartheid movement leaders, the ruling African National Congress said in a statement. After her husband was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964, she was banned from attending gatherings of more than two people and taking part in political activities, the ruling party said. In the 1960s, she faced various bans, including one confining her to her home at nights, weekends and public holidays, according to the party. Despite the setbacks, she continued with her quest for liberation. ""Although politics has given me a rough life, there is absolutely nothing I regret about what I have done and what has happened to me and my family,"" she has said. ""Instead, I have been strengthened and feel more of a woman than I would otherwise have felt if my life was different."" Zuma described the diminutive woman as a ""pillar of strength not only for her family, but also the entire liberation"" movement. ""She reared, counseled, nursed and educated most of the leaders and founders of the democratic South Africa,"" the president said in a statement. Sisulu founded the Federation of South African Women and other civic organizations. Her husband died in 2003.","Zuma describes her as a ""dignified and disciplined"" pillar for the fight to end apartheid .

"(CNN) -- The return of wild oryx to the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula is being hailed as a conservation success story. The latest International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species states that the wild population of the two-horned antelope species now stands at around 1,000, nearly 40 years after the last wild animal was hunted and killed. ""To have brought the Arabian Oryx back from the brink of extinction is a major feat, one which we hope will be repeated many times over for other threatened species,"" said Razan Khalifa Al Mubarak, Director General of the Environment Agency -- Abu Dhabi. The species is now listed as ""vulnerable"" and is the first time an animal listed as ""extinct in the wild"" has improved its status by three categories. The turn-around has been the result of conservation efforts that began in 1982 in Oman. Captive bred oryx were successfully released back into the desert habitats of the country and then in regions of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Israel and Jordan. Known locally as Al Maha, the Arabian Oryx is thought to be uniquely adapted to living in harsh, dry environments with its ability to smell water from miles away. It is thought that it was also the source of the unicorn legend, as when viewed in profile the two horns appear as one. The latest published findings from the IUCN Red List also have new additions to the ranks of endangered and threatened species. Eight new species of amphibians are classified as critically endangered, just one place from ""extinct in the wild."" The IUCN says that amphibians are one of the most threatened species groups with an estimated 41% at risk of extinction. The main threats come from habitat loss, pollution, diseases and invasive species. The IUCN estimates that human impact has meant extinctions are happening at anything between 100 and 1,000 times the natural rate.","Arabian Oryx return to wild hailed as 'conservation success story'

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- The Ivorian government announced the creation Thursday of a national investigation commission on the crimes perpetrated during the post-election crisis amid mounting pressure fom human rights organizations and the United Nations. Bruno Kone, spokesman for the government, made the announcement on national TV, following a Cabinet meeting.  The ""national investigation commission will shed light on all the human rights violations perpetrated during the post-electoral crisis,"" said Kone. ""The president called for all investigations to be carried out without delay so that those responsible could be identified and be applied sanctions if needed,"" the statement added. President  Alassane Ouattara has recurrently promised no mercy for human rights abusers no matter which side of the conflict there are from. But Human Rights Watch pointed out earlier Wednesday in a statement by senior West Africa researcher Corinne Dufk that ""no one from Ouattara's camp had yet been arrested for abuses committed during the post-electoral conflict."" ""There is a growing divide between the Ouattara government's rhetoric that no one is above the law and the reality that justice appears one-sided and delayed,"" the statement said. So far those who are under investigation currently, either by the military prosecutor or by the civilian prosecutor, are all from the former officials of the government of Laurent Gbagbo, said Suleiman Baldo, a member of a U.N. investigation team on Ivory Coast post-electoral violence. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said she is concerned by the violence following the disputed election, including reports of summary executions, rape, torture and the use of children by parties to the conflict. ""We need concerted action designed to break the cycle of impunity, bring perpetrators to justice and rehabilitate victims in their rights and dignity,"" Pillay said in a statement Wednesday. Rights groups have said both sides violated human rights. ""Some of the crimes committed during the post-electoral crisis are particularly serious and might well constitute crimes against humanity,"" said Vitit Muntabhorn, who leads the commission of inquiry into Ivory Coast. ""This can be said, for example, of the generalized and systematic attacks on communities who were targeted because of their supposed political beliefs or their ethnicity."" More than 300,000 people are still displaced two months after the political crisis was settled, the U.S. State Department said this week. Displaced people are further at risk because they are in areas with food shortages and the threat of disease, heightened by the rainy season. Ongoing violence has also prevented their return home. Communal tensions are still high in the southwestern Sassandra region, where more than 280 civilians were killed last month by mercenaries on the run from the commercial capital of Abidjan, the U.N. refugee agency said. ""Many of the dead are buried in mass graves,"" said Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for the refugee agency. About 17,000 people are displaced in that region, including an unknown number still hiding in the forest, she said. Ouattara has urged the International Criminal Court to investigate major crimes committed during the political standoff. This month, the United Nations called for investigations after reports of attacks by forces loyal to Ouattara in areas known to support Gbagbo. ""The new government must show zero tolerance for the behavior of some elements of the Republican troops who continue to commit exactions,"" Muntabhorn said. Ouattara has named former Prime Minister Jean Konan Bany to a truth and reconciliation commission. The west African nation plunged into bloody chaos after a disputed presidential vote in November. Incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo defied international calls to step down after he lost the election to Ouattara. Forces loyal to Quattara seized the Gbagbo in April, essentially ousting him and ending the political stalemate that had raged for four months.

"(CNN) -- It was wet, cold and windy, and he hadn't been in contention to win golf's oldest tournament for 10 years, but Darren Clarke finally made the breakthrough at the British Open on Sunday. Two decades after he first entered the season's third major event, the 42-year-old made history as he triumphed by three shots from Americans Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson in its 140th staging at Royal St. George's in England. Clarke, whose previous best finish was runner-up in 1997, lifted the coveted Claret Jug at his 21st attempt -- breaking the record of the tournament's previous longest wait, the 15-try streak that Zimbabwean Nick Price snapped in 1994. He is the oldest British Open winner since Roberto de Vicenzo's 1967 victory aged 44, and the oldest of any major champion since 43-year-old Ben Crenshaw won the 1995 Masters. Ugly and unforgiving: Why Britain offers golf's toughest test . ""It's been a long and bumpy road, I have had some good things happen to me and some bad things, but I've had so much support from an awful lot of people,"" Clarke said at the prize-giving ceremony. ""I'd like to thank my parents and my fiancee Alison, and there's someone up there watching as well. To everybody, thank you very much."" Clarke became the third player from Northern Ireland to win a major title in the past 13 months, following Rory McIlroy's U.S. Open triumph last month and Graeme McDowell's success at the same tournament last year. He is the first from his country to win the British Open since Fred Daly in 1947. See highlights of the 2011 British Open on Golf.com . Clarke's agent Chubby Chandler now has three current major champions in his stable, with South African Charl Schwartzel winning the Masters in April before McIlroy's eight-shot triumph at Congressional. Clarke has twice won World Golf Championship events, in 2003 and 2003, while he has finished second on the European Tour's money list three times. He famously helped Europe win the Ryder Cup against the U.S. in 2006 -- his fifth appearance in the prestigious teams event -- a month after his wife Heather died from cancer. Clarke dedicated his victory to his sons Tyrone and Conor, who were back in Northern Ireland where the family has returned after years living in London. ""It's for the kids. They played Royal Portrush (golf course) this morning and were watching on TV,"" he said. Clarke, who last finished in the top-10 when he placed third at Royal Lytham & St. Anne's in 2001, could afford to bogey the final two holes as he carded a level-par 70. It was his worst score in four rounds at the links course, which has been buffeted by the weather this week, as he took home the $1.45 million first prize to the cheers of the crowd in Sandwich. Having started the final day one shot ahead of 27-year-old Johnson, Clarke faced a strong challenge from fellow 40-something Mickelson. The left-hander, seeking to add the British Open to his three Masters and one U.S. PGA Championship crown, carded three birdies and an eagle to grab a share of the lead. But Clarke restored his advantage as he also picked up two shots at the par-five seventh and then rattled off nine successive pars despite the difficult conditions, while his main rivals faltered. Mickelson's challenge fell apart at the 11th hole, where he missed a routine short par putt. More bogeys followed at 13, 15 and 16 as he finished with a 68 to be two-under 278 for the tournament. Johnson, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer. He also dropped a shot at 18 to fall back level with Mickelson. First-round leader Thomas Bjorn, whose father died in May, finished fourth on 279 after the 40-year-old Dane closed with 71. He was followed by three Americans -- Rickie Fowler (72), Anthony Kim (70) and Chad Campbell (69) -- who were tied for fifth on 280. France's Raphael Jacquelin was eighth on 281, while Spain's Sergio Garcia, Englishman Simon Dyson and U.S. Ryder Cup captain Davis Love tied for ninth on 282. Five-time champion Tom Watson tied for 22nd after a closing with 72, while McIlroy was equal 25th after a 73. England's Tom Lewis was the top amateur, with the 20-year-old tied for 30th as he fell away after sharing the early lead with Bjorn following his opening 65. Defending champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa was tied for 54th on 293 after ending with a 77.","Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke wins golf's British Open for the first time in 21 attempts .

"(CNN) -- The Boston Bruins won their first Stanley Cup in 39 years, defeating the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 Wednesday night in the seventh and deciding game of the National Hockey League's annual championship. The loss didn't go over well with hundreds of mostly young Canuck fans, who took to the streets and set several overturned vehicles afire a few blocks from Rogers Arena where the game was played. Some fans stopped to pose in front of the flames. Others danced on top of another overturned vehicle. A dull cloud of gray smoke choked some areas of downtown. iReport: Fires, rioting and looting in Vancouver . Aerial footage showed Vancouver police wading into the unruly crowd that continually taunted and threw things at the officers. Members of the crowd leaped over one street fire, and officers wrestled several fans to the ground. ""We're unable to release anything formal at the moment but officers are busy dealing with a few core groups of people bent on committing criminal acts like mischief, vandalism, and fights,"" Vancouver Police Media Relations Officer Lindsey Houghton said in a statement. ""We're working hard to get everyone home safe."" Freelance Journalist Jorge Contreras told CNN that 1,000-2,000 people were on the streets in downtown Vancouver, and that six police vehicles had been set on fire. After dropping the first two games in Vancouver, the Bruins took four of the last five games from the Canucks, who struggled to stay in Game Seven after going down 1-0 in the first period. The Bruins blew open the game in the second, after rookie Brad Marchand sprung on a rebound off of Canuck goalie Roberto Luongo to put away his second goal of the match. ""We knew the second goal was going to be huge,"" Marchand, the 23-year-old rookie said in a post-game interview. ""It was nice to get that one, and we kept pushing forward after that."" Marchand would finish the game with two goals and one assist. But the game was really decided by Thomas, who polished off his spectacular playoff performance with a Game Seven shutout to take the coveted Conn Smythe trophy. Tim Thomas -- whose unorthodox goalkeeping mystified the Canucks all night -- set the NHL record for most shots faced and most saves in playoff history. He also shattered Johnny Bower's 1960s record for most saves in a Stanley Cup final. Coming into the series, Vancouver was considered the superior squad on special teams, especially on power plays. But that wasn't the case in this year's Stanley Cup, as Boston put away five power play goals to Vancouver's two. Vancouver was also outscored 10-0 in the second period. ""We finally brought our game from home on the road,"" Zdeno Chara told Team Radio Canada. ""We played physical and took care of the puck, played extremely hard and paid attention to the details."" Patrice Bergeron's first period goal should have been enough for fans to know the game's outcome, as the team that scored the first goal won every game in this series. The Bruins now have won the Stanley Cup six times, fourth-most among all NHL franchises, but hadn't captured the sport's most coveted prize since 1972. They had been to the finals five other times since they last won, but this time marked their first appearance since 1990. The Canucks have been to the finals three times in their 40 seasons in the league, but have never won. Holding the home-ice advantage, they won the first two games of the series, but lost all three games played in Boston before losing at home on Wednesday. They were seeking to become the first Canadian team to win the NHL title since the Montreal Canadiens in 1993.","Police move in after Vancouver fans set vehicle afire, throw items .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- The term of service for the president should be extended from its current four years -- renewable once -- to a single term of ""a little more than four years,"" Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said Tuesday in a statement. He said he will send a bill to National Assembly to pass the changes to the constitution that would set the parameters he is seeking. It will be his first bill since he took the reins of power in April. Jonathan insisted he would not benefit from the change, since it would not go into effect until the next election, in 2015. But it was not clear that he was being sincere. Several presidential sources told CNN that Jonathan is pushing for a six- or seven-year term. And, though he implied this year during a speech in East Africa that he would not run again in 2015, Jonathan has never made such a statement publicly in Nigeria. The last elections, in April, were among the most violent in the country's history and influential elements (particularly from the predominantly Muslim north of the country who feel it is their turn to have the presidency) staunchly oppose his extending his hold on power. April's elections pitted residents of the country's north against those of the (predominantly Christian) south, where Jonathan is from. Since then, violence in the north has escalated -- much of it attributed to the Islamic militant group Boko Haram and almost daily attacks in the northeastern city of Maiduguri. Such violence could escalate still further, as could attacks in the capital city of Abuja, where many residents resent what they consider to have been Jonathan's hijacking of the election from the north. Though Jonathan took power in May, his hold on it remains tenuous: He has yet to form a complete cabinet; has failed to push through passage of a major petroleum bill; and has failed to quell violence in the north. Public expectation is for him to encourage economic growth and investment, as well as private reforms in the power sector -- the two main issues of his campaign platform. It would be difficult to focus on these two major areas if the start of his presidency is focused on such a controversial bill. The length of the presidential term has been a hot-button issue for years. Jonathan's predecessor, Olusegun Obasanjo, attempted to run for a third term before his constitutionally approved two-term limit expired in 2007. That bid failed in the face of opposition from the north. Jonathan's bill could be seen as a ""rebranding"" of Obasanjo's attempt to push third-term bill. In his envisaged bill, the tenure of members of the National and State assemblies would also be extended to a little more than four years, though lawmakers would be eligible for re-election. Jonathan said his commitment to a single term for the president and governors was a reflection of his belief that a longer term would help stabilize society and strengthen democracy. It would minimize the acrimony and unrest that quadrennial elections generate at the federal and state levels, he said, adding that it would also save the government the expense of conducting party primaries and general elections every four years. ""The proposed amendment bill is necessary to consolidate our democracy and allow elected executives to concentrate on governance and service delivery for their full term, instead of running governments with re-election as their primary focus,"" he said. Jonathan noted that ""certain reports in a section of the media"" had interpreted his move as an attempt to lengthen his hold on power. But, he added, ""Nothing can be more untrue. The energy that has been devoted to speculations on the content of the likely bill is akin to an attempt to force the abortion of a nonexistent pregnancy. The details of the bill will be clear in terms of its provisions when it is forwarded to the National Assembly for consideration.""","Jonathan wants to extend slightly the current 4-year presidential term .

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony walked free from a Florida jail early Sunday morning, three years and one day after she was first arrested for her role in the disappearance and, eventually, death of her 2-year-old daughter. Anthony walked out of the front door of the Orange County Jail at 12:09 a.m. with her lawyer by her side and two Special Response Team officers with green vests. Sheriff's deputies had two contingency plans laid out, but in the end opted to go with a public release. ""We have made every effort to not provide any special treatment for her,"" said Allen Moore, the spokesman for the Orange County Corrections Department in a statement. ""She has been treated like every other inmate in her custody class."" Anthony had not received threats against her at the jail, but ""this release had an unusual amount of security. So therefore, in that sense, it would not be a normal release,"" Moore said. With $537.68 from her inmate account handed to her, Anthony offered a quick thanks to a Special Response Team sergeant. She then walked out of the jail building doors and into a dark-colored sport utility vehicle. Her hair was pulled up in a tight bun and she had on a bright pink V-neck T-shirt, blue jeans and sneakers. She did not show any emotion. Given the threats against her life by those furious at the not-guilty verdict, Anthony's lawyers have not said where she will go next. News helicopters that tracked the SUV showed it head to downtown Orlando and into the parking garage of her lawyer  Cheney Mason's office. Throngs of television camera crews and a crowd of about 1,000 people were at hand outside the jail to witness the release. Most of those who waved placards in the jail parking lot were there to voice their opposition to Anthony's release, but they did so peacefully. Police, some on horseback, kept a wary eye. As Anthony left, some demonstrators shouted and jeered. Some screamed, ""Killer!"" The Orlando woman's release comes 12 days after a jury acquitted her on murder and child neglect charges. That verdict brought an abrupt end to a six-week trial that drew intense media hype for its elements of family drama and mystery over what happened to young Caylee Anthony. While Anthony was cleared on the more serious charges, the jury of seven women and five men did convict her on four counts of misleading law enforcement agents who were investigating Caylee's whereabouts. Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. gave Anthony credit for time served in determining the release date. She was initially taken into custody on July 16, 2008, and had been jailed -- with some brief exceptions, having been freed on bail on multiple occasions -- for most of the past three years. Her toddler girl's skeletal remains were eventually found in a wooded field not far from the home of Casey Anthony's parents in December 2008, seven months after she was last seen. Protesters on Sunday staged a silent march between the parents' home and where the toddler's remains were found, which has been turned into a memorial site. They said they wanted the day to be about Caylee and not about Anthony being released from jail. Prosecutors tried, unsuccessfully, to convince jurors that Anthony used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious and then duct-taped her mouth and nose to suffocate her. Her defense lawyers, meanwhile, painted Caylee's death as an accident, claiming that she'd drowned accidentally at the family pool and that Casey and her father George Anthony both covered it up. The questions about how Caylee died, and who was responsible, remain open. But a more immediate issue is what happens next to the girl's mother, who attracted intense anger, revulsion and even sympathy from a public that she will once again be a part of. While there have been cash donations to her jailhouse account, the more widespread sentiment is against Casey Anthony, with many believing she got away with killing her daughter. This fury has led to speculation that the polarizing subject of the ""I Hate Casey Anthony"" Facebook page -- and the source of ire for its more than 40,000 fans -- might change her name and appearance, and move someplace far away. ""If her attorneys are doing the right thing and are doing their jobs, they're going to have to explain to her that there is real hatred out there for her, that there have been death threats, that she cannot just walk amongst the population,"" HLN legal contributor Sunny Hostin said. ""That is not just going to happen."" Florida corrections officials, and Anthony's lawyers, have offered few details. That's in part likely due to the intense emotions Anthony's release has generated. ""I know it's bad God Forgive me but i hope someone wipes that smirk off her face. With a mack truck,"" one poster on the ""I Hate Casey Anthony"" Facebook page wrote. Visiting the Orlando site where Caylee's remains were found, Rebecca Stone said she believed the toddler's mother ""put her here"" -- even if the jury did not reach the same conclusion. When asked about what's next for Casey Anthony, the Flowery Branch, Georgia, mother of two told CNN, ""I don't think she will be alive for long."" An Oklahoma woman said she has already faced the kind of ire Anthony may face when she's no longer behind the protective walls of the Orange County Jail. Sammy Blackwell told CNN affiliate KOTV that a woman who mistook her for Anthony on July 8 rammed her car twice, flipping it over. ""She said that I was trying to hurt babies, I was killing babies and she was going to stop it before it happened again,"" Blackwell told the station. As it happens, Blackwell has a daughter named Caylee too, but that's the end of the similarities. She says she really doesn't even look that much like Anthony and worries for women who do. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said Tuesday that investigators are assessing threats to Anthony's safety. While he said the department was not aware of any credible threats to her life, it's a concern that was clearly on his mind. ""Nobody has a right to take the law in their own hands,"" he said. ""Casey Anthony had her day in court and the jury made a decision. I would hope people would step back and would not go out and commit another crime."" It's also a concern for her attorneys. ""Myself and other members of the team are concerned for her safety, very much so,"" one of her attorneys, Dorothy Sims, told HLN. What Anthony will do now is unclear. ""If I knew at this point, I'm sure you can appreciate that I wouldn't tell you,"" Sims said. ""I don't believe that that has been resolved. My hope for her would be that she would be left alone and her privacy would be respected."" Hostin said on CNN that she's heard reports that Anthony will go into hiding, live under an assumed name or get plastic surgery. ""But I think we are going to hear her story, because people have offered her a million dollars already for her story,"" she said. Anthony also still has legal issues to deal with. Her criminal team is appealing her convictions for misleading police, and she is being sued in two separate actions in civil court. One is filed by a woman with the same name Anthony gave to investigators as the name of her daughter's fictitious nanny. The other involves a search group that wants Anthony to repay expenses they incurred looking for Caylee. Anthony may be offered money for book and movie deals, but one offer won't be on the table. Playboy founder Hugh Hefner told CNN's Piers Morgan that the magazine won't be offering Anthony a pictorial. ""I wouldn't reward someone like that for what has happened,"" Hefner said. Defense attorney Mason, who once said he thought of Anthony as a granddaughter, said he doesn't know what life holds in store for his client, but has hopes. ""She is only 25 years old. A decade from now, hopefully, she'll have some stability in her life and maybe a husband, and they can be somewhere in Montana and start over,"" he said. CNN's Greg Botelho, Martin Savidge and journalists Mike Pearson and Catherine Callaway contributed to this report.","Sheriff's deputies had two contingency plans .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- The Turkish government moved Friday to resolve a crisis that erupted earlier in the day when the country's top four military officers left their jobs en masse in the latest power play between the government and the Turkish military. Late at night, the government turned to the only top commander who has not quit his position, naming former Gendarmerie Commander General Necdet Ozel acting chief of general staff and land force commander. According to people familiar with Turkey's procedures, he needs to serve at least for a day as a force commander before he can be appointed to the top military position of chief of general staff. The announcement came hours after Chief of Staff Gen. Isik Kosaner tendered his retirement letter to the prime minister, the country's state-run Anatolia News Agency reported. Land Forces commander Gen. Erdal Ceylanoglu, Navy commander Adm. Esref Ugur Yigit and Air Forces commander Gen. Hasan Aksay, all asked for their retirement. Their departures came in the face of disagreements by the military with the government over the fate of officers jailed for allegedly plotting to overthrow the ruling Justice and Development Party. And they come at a key time -- three days before Monday's planned meeting of Turkey's Supreme Military Council, which will decide what happens to the officers, state-run media reported Friday. The government wants active-duty officers who are defendants in the case to retire. The military says the officers, some of whom are up for promotions, have not been proven guilty and therefore should not be forced to leave. Kosaner had met earlier Friday with President Abdullah Gul and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who won his third term in office last June in a landslide victory, a show of political power that has energized his base of support. About 200 soldiers, including senior ones, both retired and active-duty, are defendants in an ongoing court case about an alleged coup plan dubbed ""Sledgehammer"" said to have been cooked up eight years ago at a meeting of military officers. ""It's unprecedented to have the chief of staff and three force commanders resigning en masse,"" said Bulent Aliriza, director and senior associate of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Turkey Project. ""It's an expression of displeasure with the civilian government and, frankly, leaves in disarray the promotion process that was about to begin,"" he said.  ""This is their clearest possible response to Prime Minister Erdogan."" He said it comes at an important time, with the Turkish military fighting the Kurdistan Workers' Party in the southeast, and predicted the moves will create massive complications among the land forces. Aliriza said the military establishment, according to its traditions, puts forth its own promotion recommendations, with the participation of the prime minister and the defense minister. Once they reach an agreement, the list is sent to the president for approval. But there have been tensions between the country's military, which has supported the secular system over the years, and Erdogan's party, which has Islamist roots. Accusations by Erdogan's government that military and secular figures were involved in coup plots have intensified hostilities. The government wants to prevent these officers from getting promoted and holding key positions in the military while the military does not want them to be forced to retire. Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish research program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a visiting professor at Georgetown University, wrote in an article for CNN's Global Public Square on Friday that the military ""is snapping under the weight of the ruling Justice and Development Party,"" known as the AKP. ""Historically the most-respected institution in the country and the kingmaker in Ankara, the military has seen its prestige and power free-fall since the AKP took power in 2002,"" Cagaptay wrote. ""Coup allegations, including assertions that the military was planning to bomb Istanbul's historic mosques to precipitate a political crisis, have hurt the Turkish army's standing. The military's status as the most trusted institution in the country is plummeting: in 2002, around 90 percent of the Turks said they trusted their military, while now most polls show that barely 60 percent say they do."" He mentions another court case, known as Ergenekon, which also accuses the military of involvement in a coup plot: ""For the first time in its life, the Turkish military is like a deer in headlights, facing the political high beams of the Ergenekon case."" ""And now the military has snapped. The straw that broke the camel's back came earlier this week, when pro-AKP media suggested that 14 active-duty generals and admirals who had been arrested in relationship to the Ergenekon case, though not yet indicted, would not only be bypassed in their promotions, but also forced to resign. Furthermore, only yesterday, the police arrested 22 additional top brass officers, blocking their likely promotion."" He said the ""officer corps is demoralized,"" with generals and hundreds of other officers jailed with no indictments in sight. ""This is the Turkish military leadership's way of telling the government: 'We are done playing with you. Set up your own team -- if you can,"" he said. Yesim Comert reported from Istanbul. Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta.","NEW: The only top commander who did not quit is promoted .

"(CNN) -- The United States is deeply concerned about the well-being of Eman al-Obeidy, according to a State Department source, and worked closely with officials in Europe and Libya to get her safely out of the country.  The same source said the U.S. is ""prepared to provide whatever help and support Eman may need."" Al-Obeidy grabbed the world's attention this spring when she accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's security forces of gang-raping her. She is now on the way to Malta with her father, according to another high-level U.S. State Department source. She will eventually head to a processing center in Europe before leaving for a final destination. She has told CNN on repeated occasions that she wants to go to the United States. One of the State Department sources told CNN that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ""has been deeply interested in the case and has followed it throughout."" Al-Obeidy was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported Thursday and sent back to Libya. She was reportedly beaten before being deported. Najah Dawaji, a U.S.-based Libyan pro-freedom activist, said she was with three key members of Libya's Transitional National Council when they first learned that al-Obeidy was forced from Doha and arrived in Benghazi, Libya, on Thursday. She said al-Obeidy had a black eye, bruises on her legs and scratches on her arms. Al-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her. But, according to Dawaji, she did not blame the rebel group for the beating itself. Al-Obeidy told CNN that when she asked her attackers why they were beating her, they said that Mahmoud Shammam and Mahmoud Jibril, both leaders in the Libyan rebel movement, had sent the Qataris an ""urgent letter"" saying that she had to be deported immediately. After arriving in Qatar, al-Obeidy had made public statements saying the Transitional National Council was using her. The council denied that. Council members were upset upon seeing al-Obeidy's condition and vowed to open an investigation, Dawaji said. Al-Obeidy told CNN that in the hours leading to her deportation, armed guards were posted outside her hotel room, preventing a representative from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees from helping her. The U.N. agency had prepared papers for her departure from Qatar to begin a new life. She said Qatari authorities took her and her parents from the Kempinski Residences and Suites in the Qatari capital. She said she was beaten and handcuffed, then forced onto a military plane to Libya. She said the Qataris had taken everything from her and her parents -- including cell phones, her laptop and money. When told by the UNHCR that she was protected under refugee status, Qatari agents said, ""We don't have an agreement with the U.N.,"" according to al-Obeidy. Al-Obeidy said a group of men and women beat her, her father and her sister in a parking lot, and they were beaten more at the airport. The United States said it was ""disappointed"" by al-Obeidy's expulsion, which it said was ""a breach of humanitarian norms."" Amnesty International called the deportation ""outrageous,"" saying the action by the Qatari government ""is a serious breach by Qatar of its international obligations."" CNN's Khalil Abdallah and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","NEW: State Department source: U.S. prepared to help Eman Al-Obeidy .

"(CNN) -- Jason Baldwin paused Saturday on his first morning of freedom in 18 years to share a revelation he gleaned in prison while serving a life sentence. The ""West Memphis Three"" member recalled telling inmates he had figured out the secret of life. ""What is it?"" they asked. ""I said, 'Enjoy it. Enjoy it,'"" Baldwin told CNN Memphis affiliate WMC. And enjoy it he did Friday and Saturday. Baldwin, Damien Echols and Jessie Misskelley Jr. -- freed Friday in Arkansas after a complicated plea arrangement -- spent time with family, friends and supporters. Echols and Baldwin saw the sunset Friday from the rooftop of the Madison Hotel in Memphis, across the Mississippi River from West Memphis, Arkansas. Supporters Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks joined the party. The three men, who served 18 years in prison following their convictions in a 1993 triple-slaying in West Memphis, walked free Friday to cheers from a supportive crowd after entering rarely used pleas in which they maintained their innocence but acknowledged that prosecutors have evidence to convict them. They had been imprisoned for the slayings of second-graders Steven Branch, Christopher Byers and Michael Moore. The boys' bodies were mutilated and left in a ditch, hogtied with their own shoelaces. Prosecutors argued that the defendants, teenagers at the time, were driven by satanic ritual and that Echols, sentenced to death, had been the ringleader. Baldwin and Misskelley received life sentences. Attorney Stephen Braga, who represented Echols, said his newly freed client and Baldwin were fascinated by new foods, cell phones and other technology Friday. ""It was if you could see two little 5-year-old kids at their first Christmas,"" Braga told CBS' ""Early Show"" Saturday. ""The idea you could take pictures with an iPhone totally blew them away."" Misskelley spent Friday night with his family near West Memphis. CNN affiliate WREG said Echols, who met his wife while serving time, and Baldwin left Saturday for undisclosed locations to enjoy seclusion. Echols and Baldwin entered what is known as an Alford plea on three counts of first-degree murder. Misskelley entered similar pleas to one count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder. Craighead County Circuit Judge David Laser sentenced the three to the 18 years already served and imposed a 10-year suspended sentence -- meaning they could be returned to jail if they violate the law. ""I don't think that it will make the pain go away to the victims' families. I don't think it will make the pain go away to the defendant families,"" Laser said, adding it was nevertheless the best for all involved. Critics of the case against the men argued that no direct evidence tied the three to the murders and that a knife recovered from a lake near the home of one of the men could not have caused the boys' wounds. More recent DNA testing also demonstrated no links, according to the men's supporters. Baldwin said he didn't initially want to accept the deal. ""This was not justice,"" he said, adding that he dropped his opposition to pave the way for Echols' release from death row. ""I have now spent half my life on death row,"" Echols said in a statement released Saturday. ""It is a torturous environment that no human being should have to endure, and it needed to end. I am innocent, as are Jason and Jessie, but I made this decision because I did not want to spend another day of my life behind those bars."" While prosecuting attorney Scott Ellington said the pleas entered Friday validate the decision of jurors who sent the men to prison, it also spares Arkansas the possibility of a retrial, which would have been difficult to prosecute after so many years, or a potential civil lawsuit by the men. The trio had been on course to win the right to new trials later this year. Ellington said he believes the pleas resolve the case. ""I have no reason to believe there was anyone else involved in the homicide of these three children but the three defendants who pled guilty today,"" he said. But he said the state could file charges against others if new evidence emerges implicating someone else in the case. John Mark Byers, whose stepson Christopher Byers was one of the three victims, said he believes the three men are innocent and releasing them without exonerating them of the crime is an outrage. ""They're innocent. They did not kill my son,"" Byers said before the hearing. The father of another of the victims, Steven Branch, also blasted the decision, but for another reason. ""I don't know what kind of deal they worked up,"" Steve Branch told CNN affiliate WMC-TV before the hearing. ""Now you can get some movie stars and a little bit of money behind you, and you can walk free for killing somebody."" Baldwin, who said he prays for the victims' families, told WMC Saturday he hopes to return to school. ""Right now, I am floating on the hands of people who love and care for me, people trying to get my feet under me and everything,"" he said. ""I'm just trusting God to take care of me."" Braga credited new DNA evidence, a new hearing and a new judge as instrumental to Friday's proceedings. The attorney claims the three freed men and supporters will push to see that the real killer eventually is found. ""He's still out there,"" Braga told CBS. ""The right guys have been set free.""","The ""West Memphis 3"" go free after entering new pleas in a 1993 murder case .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords has been released from the hospital in Houston, Texas, and expects to begin outpatient treatment soon, according to a statement released Wednesday by TIRR Memorial Hermann. Giffords was shot in the head January 8 during a mass shooting incident in Arizona. She is expected to move into her home in League City, Texas, where she will continue rehabilitation therapy. ""We are very excited that she has reached the next phase of her rehabilitation and can begin outpatient treatment,"" said Dr. Gerard Francisco, the hospital's chief medical officer. Francisco will continue to supervise Giffords' case. Giffords will still get intensive therapy as an outpatient and will work with the same rehab team that has been with her from the beginning, the statement said. She has been at TIRR Memorial Hermann since late January. ""Gabby gives her all to everything she does, and that's exactly what she's been doing at TIRR since January 26,"" said Navy Capt. Mark Kelly, Giffords' husband. ""The remarkable progress she has made since then is a testament to both her single-minded determination to get better and the team of medical professionals overseeing her care."" Jared Lee Loughner, 22, is charged in the mass shooting in which six people were killed and 13 others, including Giffords, were wounded in front of a Safeway grocery story in Tucson, Arizona. A federal judge ruled last month that Loughner is not competent to stand trial. His next court date is scheduled for September 21. Giffords' road to recovery has been marked by a number of public milestones, including a trip to see the space shuttle launch that carried her husband on a 16-day mission in May and the recent release of new photos showing a smiling, relaxed Giffords. When the photos were posted on Giffords' Facebook page, she received an outpouring of well wishes. ""You are so special,"" Facebook poster, John Evanchik, wrote. ""And you have so much courage and fortitude that I am so proud to say that you are a real role model for so many people who, in their circumstance, they probably give up, but not you, Congresswoman. Yes, God has blessed you."" The photos were taken prior to Giffords' May 18 surgery to replace a portion of her skull removed earlier to relieve pressure on her brain. Francisco said Wednesday that doctors are enthusiastic about Giffords' recovery and expect it to continue to go well. ""Living and working in a rehab facility for five months straight has been especially challenging for her,"" Kelly said in the hospital statement. ""She will still go to TIRR each day but from now on, when she finishes rehab, she will be with her family.""","NEW: Husband, ""She will be with her family.""

"London (CNN) -- The dust may only just have settled in Tunisia after the Jasmine Revolution, but that has not stopped the launch of a highly provocative marketing campaign designed to entice British and French holidaymakers to the country. Adverts humoring the historic events of just a few months ago -- in which at least 300 people were killed according to the U.N., and which unleashed a wave of pro-democracy movements across the Middle East --have sprung up on London's famous red double-decker buses and Paris metro stations. One of the adverts shows a woman being massaged next to the words: ""They say that in Tunisia some people receive heavy-handed treatment."" In another one, ancient Roman ruins are juxtaposed alongside this caption: ""They say Tunisia is nothing but ruins."" The company behind the campaign, Memac Ogilvy, defended using the recent revolution in a humorous context. Nicolas Courant, creative director of Memac Ogilvy in Tunis, said: ""We wanted to create a debate, it is a way to drive awareness... there is a perception in Europe of there still being a security problem in Tunisia. ""We wanted to do something with our Tunisian humor, it is a nice way to show how things have changed... it is OK to live here, we are living here."" Income from tourism is a significant part of the Tunisian economy but slumped during the uprising. Visitor numbers are slowly recovering, according to figures from the Tunisian National Tourist Office in London, but they are still expected to be 50% down on 2010, says Mehdi Houas, the Tunisian Trade and Tourism Minister. Tourist numbers for 2011 are expected to fall to 3.5 million. That's in contrast to 7 million in 2010, who brought in $2.55 billion in revenues. ""It's been terrible. The only sector affected was tourism, and of course (related) work. But it's terrible for the economy as a whole because it's 50% of our foreign exchange,"" Houas told Reuters.com . Protests against the former president Zine el Abidine Ben Ali -- who had ruled Tunisia since 1987 -- began to erupt late last year. Fed up with corruption, unemployment and escalating prices of food, people began demonstrating en masse after the self-immolation suicide of a fruit cart vendor in December. The revolt led to Ben Ali's ouster and triggered a wave of protests against longtime rulers across North Africa and the Middle East. Ben Ali will be tried in absentia next week, the country's interim prime minister said Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- A seminary student who was in Haiti along with his wife and cousin is believed to have been killed in the magnitude-7.0 earthquake that struck the island nation, his family and seminary said Thursday. Benjamin Larson, 25, from LaCrosse, Wisconsin, the son of two Lutheran ministers, was in his fourth year as a master's of divinity student at Wartburg Theological Seminary in Dubuque, Iowa. He was in Haiti, along with his wife, Renee, and his cousin Jonathan Larson, both of whom also are fourth-year seminary students, to help with the new Haiti Lutheran Church, said a statement on the Web site of the First Lutheran Church in Duluth, where Benjamin Larson's mother, the Rev. April Larson, is pastor. His father, the Rev. Judd Larson, is interim pastor at Our Savior's Lutheran Church in Duluth. ""Pastors April and Judd Larson wish to share with you ... the profound sorrow with which they are living, and to ask for your prayers,"" the statement said. The Larsons received a message early Thursday that their son had been killed, according to the statement. Benjamin Larson was teaching at the Pastors and Lay Leaders Theological Conference in Haiti, the statement said. At the time of the quake, the three relatives were staying at St. Joseph's Home for Boys on a mountain in Port-au-Prince, First Lutheran Church said. ""During the earthquake, the building collapsed on all three."" Renee and Jonathan Larson were able to escape, but could not find Benjamin Larson, the statement said. They had to flee down the mountain immediately. Wednesday morning, Renee Larson and others returned to try to find Ben, to no avail, according to the First Lutheran statement and a statement from seminary President Duane Larson. (He is not closely related to the students). Renee and Jonathan Larson were at the U.S. Embassy in Haiti, and were to be evacuated to the Dominican Republic on Thursday, Duane Larson said. They are expected to be returned to the United States this week, he said. Jonathan Larson, of Red Wing, Minnesota, and his cousin were serving as teachers in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Haiti for a January term project, Duane Larson said. Renee Larson, originally of Garrison, North Dakota, was doing interviews and research for her thesis on the beginnings of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Haiti. ""Ben was so excited to become a pastor,"" April Larson said in the First Lutheran statement. ""Ben loved Christ and he loved people."" In an interview with the ECLA news service, cited by the seminary in a written statement, April Larson described her son as ""gentle, in love with Christ, in love with people, in love with life. He's been hearing God's call. His life belonged to God. If you want to know Ben, listen to his music."" Benjamin Larson was the youngest of the couple's four children, the seminary said. His name was the first released of an American victim in the Haiti quake. State Department officials said a U.S. Embassy employee also was among the dead, but did not identify the victim, saying relatives were being notified. A seminary classmate, Corrine Denis, cried as she spoke about Benjamin Larson, who she had known since their pre-seminary college days at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. ""A lot of people say, 'He would give you the shirt off his back,' but Ben really would,"" Denis said. ""He'd give you his hat and his socks and whatever you needed."" She said Larson led the music team at the college's student-led worship service. ""Ben was compassionate to the nth degree,"" she said. When he was headed to their floor on campus, she said, ""You could hear him singing in the stairwell before he got there."" He was ""full of light, and truly Christ's love emanated from him,"" Denis said. ""He was one of a kind, and we will miss him so deeply."" Duane Larson said, ""We so grieve with his parents, April and Judd; for Renee's loss of her husband; Jonathan's loss of a dear cousin, for our loss of a beautiful friend. Ben's baptismal light burned so brightly in our community and for all who came to know him. We grieve the loss of so clear a proclamation, with eyes twinkling, of Christ's love, compassion and humor."" He told reporters he had known Benjamin Larson for a couple of years before he began studying at Wartburg, and is a close friend with his family. ""It's a very personal loss."" He said the seminary student had a commitment to spreading God's word in a ""healing, musical and compassionate and easygoing way."" He said he believed the Larsons had left for Haiti on January 4. Benjamin Larson was a key member of the seminary's basketball team and played racquetball, he said. A family spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment from CNN Thursday. ""He loved God,"" April Larson told the Duluth News Tribune newspaper Thursday. ""He loved the church. He loved people. He was just one of those people that built love and community wherever he was. ""He was somebody who loved life, loved living ... a person filled up with joy. He was just a ton of fun."" In 2008, Benjamin Larson served as an intern at Our Savior's Lutheran Church in Lincoln, Nebraska. Pastor Lowell Hennigs did not want to comment to CNN Thursday, saying he had not spoken with Larson's parents. In a church newsletter from 2008, however, Hennigs wrote that both Benjamin and Renee Larson were ""delightful, outgoing and extremely talented young folks"" and musicians. Benjamin Larson composed music and liturgy and played a wide variety of instruments, he said. Rafael Malpica Padilla, executive director of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America's Global Mission Unit, told the Larsons, ""We will do everything [we] can to help find Ben and bring him home,"" the First Lutheran statement said. A fourth Wartburg student, Sarah Thomson, is safe in Jacmel, Haiti, the seminary said. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","Benjamin Larson of LaCrosse, Wisconsin, died in the Haiti quake, his family said Thursday .

"(CNN) -- At least 150 people drowned when a boat leaving Libya capsized off the Tunisian coast this week, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday. Scores more were still missing as a rescue operation by Tunisian authorities continued. But at least 578 people survived the sinking Wednesday, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. On Thursday, 195 survivors were transferred to a humanitarian aid camp close to the Tunisia-Libya border, according to a statement from the refugee agency. An additional 383 survivors were expected to be taken to the same or nearby camps for help. The overcrowded boat, which set sail May 28 from Tripoli, was headed for the Italian island of Lampedusa carrying about 850 people. The passengers were mostly migrants from West Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh who were fleeing fighting in Libya, the refugee agency said in a statement. The agency said some survivors reported the boat was manned by people with little or no maritime experience. Soon after the boat left Tripoli, it ran into difficulties and by Tuesday, the passengers ran out of food and water. The boat ran aground Wednesday near the Kerkennah Islands, about 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) northwest of Tripoli in the Mediterranean Sea, the refugee agency reported. ""Desperate passengers rushed to one side, seeking rescue by the Tunisian coast guard and fishing boats that had approached the vessel,"" and the boat capsized, the agency said. ""This appears to be one of the worst and the deadliest incidents in the Mediterranean so far this year,"" said Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the refugee agency. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter Europe. More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked the dangerous journey to Lampedusa. At one point, the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa, which numbers less than 6,000. ""Boats loaded with migrants fleeing the ongoing conflict in Libya have been making the journey to Italy and Malta over recent months, sometimes with tragic consequences,"" the refugee agency said in its statement. ""Just last month, hundreds died as a vessel carrying about 600 people broke up shortly after departing Tripoli.""","U.N. refugee agency: 578 people survive the sinking .

"(CNN) -- Uruguay hero Fernando Muslera was delighted after his team stunned hosts Argentina in a penalty shootout to reach the semifinals of the Copa America tournament, despite having a player sent off. The goalkeeper saved a spot-kick by striker Carlos Tevez to earn ""La Celeste"" a clash with Peru, who beat Colombia 2-0 after extra-time in Cordoba earlier on Saturday. The Uruguayans, who reached the last four at the 2010 World Cup, will be seeking to make the Copa final for the first time since 1999 when they line up in La Plata on Tuesday. The upset victory against close neighbors Argentina came exactly 61 years after Uruguay won the World Cup by stunning Brazil in Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium. Peru shock Colombia to reach last four . ""We are very, very happy to make such a big step in the tournament,"" Muslera, 25, told reporters. ""I hope I have just played one of the best matches in my short career. I'm very happy for all the people in Uruguay. This team deserves this win. ""We were better than Argentina, even playing with 10 men. Then, penalties are just a matter of luck."" His teammate Diego Lugano added: ""We fought more than we played. There is a long way to go yet. We have not achieved anything, but we defeated the most difficult rival."" Has Argentine football reached crisis point? Uruguay shocked the home crowd in Santa Fe when Diego Perez scored in the fifth minute after goalkeeper Sergio Romero dived to block Martin Caceres' header from a free-kick by Diego Forlan. Striker Gonzalo Higuain equalized 12 minutes later from a cross by Lionel Messi in a move combining the stars of rival Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona. Perez went from hero to villain just when he received a second booking six minutes before halftime, but Argentina could not capitalize on the numerical advantage -- which was leveled just before the end of regulation play when midfielder Javier Mascherano was also sent off for a second yellow card. Higuain could have won it in extra-time but hit the post with only Muslera in his way, and the goalkeeper took center stage in the shootout when he saved Argentina's third attempt from substitute Tevez. Uruguay won it 5-4 with successful spot-kicks from Forlan, Luis Suarez, Andres Scotti, Walter Gargano and Caceres. River Plate's fate a warning to Latin American giants . Messi, Nicolas Burdisso, sub Javier Pastore and Higuain were on target for Argentina, runners-up the last two times in 2003 and 2007 and winners most recently in 1991 and 1993. Coach Sergio Batista said he had no intention of resigning just five months after taking over team affairs on a permanent basis. ""That's not on my mind, the pain of defeat is here, but you have to keep working,"" he told reporters. ""When my work began ... we were intending to win the Copa America, but our main goal is the World Cup. I do not think it was a failure, we did everything possible to try to win the cup, but we couldn't. Failure is a very strong word, we worked to win the competition.""

"Baghdad (CNN) -- The U.S. Embassy in Iraq is distancing itself from statements made by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher that led to a government spokesman saying the congressman and his delegation are not welcome in the country. Embassy spokesman David Ranz issued a statement Saturday saying ""congressional visitors do not necessarily express the views of the U.S. administration or even a majority of Congress. The visitors this weekend made that clear in their remarks."" In widely reported statements after a meeting Friday with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, the California Republican said he informed the Iraqi leader that his House committee is investigating the killing of Iranian exiles by Iraqi forces. Rohrabacher, the chairman of the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also told reporters during a news conference at the embassy in Baghdad that he suggested Iraq repay some of the cost of the war. ""Once Iraq becomes a very rich and prosperous country ... we would hope that some consideration be given to repaying the United States some of the mega-dollars that we have spent here in the last eight years,"" said Rohrabacher, according to the Agence France-Presse news agency. CNN could not independently confirm the comments that were attributed to Rohrabacher. Multiple calls to his Washington and California offices were not immediately returned. It was unclear whether the U.S. Embassy recorded the news conference. It did not make any video or audio recordings of Rohrabacher's statements available to the media. Iraq has informed the embassy that the delegation is no longer welcome, Ali al-Dabbagh, Iraq's government spokesman, said Saturday. ""We have contacted the U.S. Embassy and they said the remarks of Congressman Dana Rohrabacher expressed his own opinion and not the official opinion of the United States,"" the spokesman said. Al-Dabbagh said the relationship between Iraq and United States is still solid and would not be hurt by Rohrabacher's remarks. Ranz declined to confirm the conversation, saying ""we do not comment on private diplomatic exchanges."" Rohrabacher's comments come at a delicate time for al-Maliki, who is consulting with his government about whether to ask to extend U.S. troops beyond a January 1, 2012, deadline to withdraw. About 47,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq, down from 170,000 in 2007, during the peak of sectarian violence. Rohrabacher's trip was characterized partly as a fact-finding mission over clashes in April between Iraqi forces and Iranian exiles at Camp Ashraf that left 34 people dead and more than 200 wounded. Traveling with Rohrabacher were Democratic Rep. Russ Carnahan of Missouri; Rep. Ted Poe of Texas, a Republican member of Rohrabacher's subcommittee; Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina; Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas; and Democratic Rep. Jim Costa of California. Telephone calls to the district and Washington offices of all five congressmen were either not answered or not immediately returned. Rohrabacher has said his delegation was denied permission by al-Maliki to visit the camp, home to some 3,300 members of an Iranian guerilla group that fought against Iran's government and were given haven by Saddam Hussein's Sunni-majority government. Iraq has ordered the camp be closed by the end of the year and wants the residents to leave the country. The residents are refusing to budge, and do not recognize Iraqi sovereignty over their camp. The result has been a number of deadly clashes in recent years. The United States considers the group, known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, or MEK, to be a terrorist organization. The Iranian dissidents say they will be killed if they are returned to Iran. The U.S. has proposed a plan that would temporarily relocate the MEK within Iraq, farther from the border with Iran. Under the plan, they would later be relocated to other countries. That would not include the United States, since U.S. law bars anyone associated with a terrorist organization from settling there.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona, Buenos Aires and Miami top a list of 29 cities that attract single men on the go. The cities on the list, compiled by the editors of AskMen.com, were considered for factors from the cost of a pint of beer and a cab ride to culture, weather and food. Various aspects of the social scene also proved a dominant factor. From scouting out sports to nightlife, today's single men are looking for an all-encompassing adventure, editors said. Not surprisingly, women are a factor as well. The rest of the top 10 (out of 29) included New York City, London, Seoul, Paris, Melbourne, Bangkok and Las Vegas. Las Vegas and Bangkok have both been the setting for popular guy films ""The Hangover"" and due out at the end of May, ""The Hangover 2."" The cities of Tel Aviv, Berlin and Amsterdam topped the list for best nightlife scene, while Barcelona, Miami, and Uruguay's Montevideo topped the list for best beach cities. Sports are often a factor for single male travelers and not all the top spots are domestic.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The first batch of departing U.S. soldiers left Afghanistan this week, beginning a drawdown of 10,000 American troops scheduled to leave by year's end. About 650 U.S. soldiers left the northeastern province of Parwan on Wednesday, according to Lt. Commander Colette Murphy, a spokeswoman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. Military officials say this is the first group of soldiers whose redeployment will not be replaced by a new rotation of fresh troops. Another 600 troops are in the process of leaving, Murphy said.  Both groups are from the Iowa National Guard. The remainder of a 33,000 U.S. troop surge -- which began in 2009 -- are expected to return home by the end of 2012, President Barack Obama has said. The full draw-down is expected to take place by the end of 2014, gradually transferring responsibilities to Afghan government forces. About 150,000 ISAF forces are currently in Afghanistan, including nearly 100,000 from the United States -- the largest NATO presence in the region since the U.S.-led war began in 2001. But the costs of a near decade-long conflict may appeal less and less to a war-weary public, still reeling from the effects of a global recession. Last month, nearly three-quarters of Americans polled said they support the U.S. pulling out some or all of its forces from Afghanistan. Friday's news comes a day after Gen. David Petraeus -- the outgoing top commander of the NATO forces in Afghanistan -- crossed into Pakistan with his successor, Marine Lt. Gen. John Allen, to meet with top Pakistani military brass. The meeting -- Petraeus' seventh trip to the neighboring country as ISAF commander -- was part of an effort to ""improve regional security,"" according to a NATO statement. The United States is currently holding back $800 million in aid to its longtime ally, after Pakistan decided to reduce the number of visas for U.S. military trainers. Relations between the two nuclear powers had soured after a U.S. raid on former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's compound in May. Tensions have also been strained by U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan's tribal areas that have sometimes resulted in civilian casualties. Meanwhile, Petraeus' exit and the troop draw-down comes amid a rash of recent violence across Afghanistan, particularly in country's restive southern and eastern provinces. On Thursday, a suicide bomber slipped into a Kandahar mosque and killed at least six people, wounding 15 others, a hospital official said. The attack occurred as several high-ranking Afghan officials had gathered to remember President Hamid Karzai's half-brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, the Kandahar provincial council chief and a key powerbroker in the region, who was slain Tuesday by a long-time bodyguard. News of the draw-down has since raised looming queries about the country's future. While diminishing numbers of NATO forces are expected to transfer power to their Afghan counterparts, skeptics question whether Afghanistan's fledgling security apparatus can effectively repel a resurgent militancy without foreign intervention.","NEW: Last month nearly three-quarters of Americans said they support the U.S. pulling out .

"(CNN) -- Syrian troops rolled into the northwestern city of Saraqib early Thursday morning, just hours after evening prayers there called for an end to President Bashar al-Assad's reign, an opposition group said. This came as world powers scurried to find a solution to the five-month-long crisis engulfing the country. At least eight people were killed on Thursday in the ongoing security crackdown on anti-government demonstrators, activists said. In the latest diplomatic development, U.S. President Barack Obama and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan underscored the ""urgency of the situation"" during a phone call on Thursday, the White House said in a statement. Though U.S. officials have condemned the actions of al-Assad, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has not called for him to step down. ""We are, I think, building the -- chorus of international condemnation,"" she told CBS News. ""Rather than us saying it and nobody else following, we think it's important to lead and have others follow as well."" Meanwhile, the violence continued. In Saraqib, residents reported hearing heavy gunfire and seeing troops break down doors of local businesses during a search of the city for opposition activists, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. About 200 people had been arrested in Saraqib since troops seized the city earlier in the day, according to the Syrian Observatory group, which cited reports from opposition activists in the city. The identities of the activists were withheld at their request out of concerns for their security. The site of the latest military action is Idlib province -- whence thousands fled their homes in Jisr al-Shugur for Turkey after the Syrian military took control of that town. The operation has raised concerns that thousands may again flee to Turkey to escape the crackdown. Violence erupted in other towns and amid a growing chorus of international calls for Syria's government to end its brutal drive on peaceful protesters, the observatory said. In al-Qusair, at the Syrian-Lebanese border, five people were killed; in the eastern city of Deir Ezzor, three people died during raids and some activists' homes were set afire, the observatory said. There have been ongoing raids in the city of Daraa and a sit-in in Suwaida, both cities in the south, and heavy gunfire was heard in the Bab Amer neighborhod of the western city of Homs, according to the observatory. Syrian forces had withdrawn from the center of the western city of Hama after troops laid siege to the city more than a week ago, Syria's state-run news agency said. But the observatory said armored personnel carriers and machine guns mounted on vehicles remained in the city and 27 people have been detained. Seventy-two journalists -- including some from the United States and France -- toured Hama Wednesday with permission from the government, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported. CNN was not among them; the government has limited access to the country by journalists in recent months. Scores of people were killed during the siege that coincided with last week's start of the holy month of Ramadan, according to reports by opposition groups, including the Syrian Observatory and the Local Coordination Committees of Syria -- a loose coalition of groups that organize and document protests. The conflict in Syria erupted five months ago when Syrian forces suppressed protests in the southern city of Daraa. Anti-government fervor caught on nationwide as more protests were met with tougher crackdowns. By Wednesday, the death toll had reached 2,417 -- including more than 2,000 civilians, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria. CNN is not able to independently verify accounts of events on the ground or the death tolls. As for Obama and Erdogan, they ""reiterated their deep concern about the Syrian Government's use of violence against civilians and their belief that the Syrian people's legitimate demands for a transition to democracy should be met,"" the White House said. ""They agreed on the need for an immediate halt of all bloodshed and violence against the Syrian people. They further agreed to closely monitor the actions that the Syrian government is taking, and to consult closely in the days ahead.""

"(CNN) -- Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega opened the door to the possibility of his country going back to international bodies in an attempt to get a $17 billion payout from the United States. But the United States considers the case closed, according to William Ostick, a State Department spokesman. The money was originally awarded to Nicaragua in 1986 by the International Court of Justice in the Hague. Nicaragua had gone to the court alleging that American involvement in their civil war by arming, financing and supplying the Contra fighters was a breach of international law. The Central American country also alleged that U.S. overflights and attacks on Nicaraguan ports violated its sovereignty. The court sided with Nicaragua, and ruled that the United States was to pay reparations. Nicaragua asked for $17 billion, though an amount was never set. The United States, which did not recognize the jurisdiction of the court in this case, resisted international pressure to pay, and eventually, under the administration of President Violeta Chamorro, Nicaragua dropped its claim from the International Court in 1991. The International Court subsequently issued an order removing Nicaragua's case from the court's list, Ostick said. ""In due time we will call for a referendum,"" Ortega said Tuesday, referring to the revival of the claim. Ortega was speaking at an event commemorating the fall of former dictator Anastasio Somoza, which brought the Sandinistas to power. The aim of the Contras was to destabilize the Sandinistas, the party Ortega belongs to. The president said he would call for ""a referendum so that the people ... say whether or not we collect this debt that the 'Yankee' government owes."" ""Nicaragua has a legitimate position to be entertained and debated,"" said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs. However, it is unlikely that Ortega would seek such a referendum, which would stir the pot with the United States, he said. In some ways, Ortega has proven to be more pragmatic in his actions than his rhetoric suggests, Birns said. If Nicaragua chooses to revive the lawsuit, it could be because the impoverished nation sees the $17 billion -- or even a settlement at a fraction of that amount -- as a quick boost to the country, he said. The case is most likely closed forever, said Fred Morrison, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who was on the U.S. legal team in the first phases of the case. When Nicaragua dropped its claim, it did so by stating in a letter that it ""had decided to renounce all further right of action based on the case and did not wish to go on with the proceedings."" There is a precedent that such declarations are binding, Morrison said. ""I would think the case is now closed,"" he said.","Ortega says he may hold a referendum to see if case should be revived .

Or that he wants to lift Democratic blues that Wisconsin will turn red in the next election. Nah. Any true space cadet will tell you that Manitowoc was chosen for its ""Sputnik moment."" In his speech Tuesday night, Obama spoke of this generation's Sputnik moment, challenging America to take the next innovative leap forward. Where else to launch that new course of direction but in the tiny Lake Michigan town that's best known for its own Sputnik moment. And it was a whopper. On September 6, 1962 -- when Obama was but a mere lad, John F. Kennedy occupied the White House and the Cold War was raging -- a 20-pound hunk of smoldering metal fell from the sky and crashed in the middle of Manitowoc's Eighth Street. Turns out it was a piece of the Soviet satellite Sputnik IV. The Sputnik moment that Obama referenced happened when the Soviet Union launched the first-man made object into space -- Sputnik I in 1957 -- shocking the United States into a technological boom. Sputnik IV came five years later. It burned up in the atmosphere and ended up linking Manitowoc to Sputnik in a way no other American town is. Two Manitowoc police officers noticed what looked like a piece of cardboard lying in the street, according to the Rahr-West Art Museum, which sponsors a Sputnik festival in Manitowoc every year. They approached the glowing object and kicked it to the curb, thinking it was a piece of slag from a local foundry. Wrong! After they heard about Sputnik IV breaking up in space, they realized what they had stumbled upon and rushed back to retrieve it from the gutter. It was sent to the Smithsonian Institution for analysis and was confirmed as a piece of the Soviet satellite. The Soviets eventually reclaimed their precious chunk. But Manitowoc was forever etched into the history of space exploration, a fact that is now celebrated each year with Sputnikfest. ""48 years later. ... It's wacky! It's tacky! It's time to celebrate with Sputnikfest!"" says the festival's website. ""Be hokey, fun, and ridiculous!"" Elaine Schroeder, a Rahr-West Art Museum staffer, said she watched Obama's speech Tuesday night and after he spoke of the Sputnik moment, she wondered: Is this why he's coming to my town? ""Oh my gosh,"" she said to herself. ""I wonder if he knows we have a (Sputnik) replica here."" No matter, Schroeder said, Obama's visit to Manitowoc is sure to be cosmic.","A chunk of Sputnik IV fell from the sky in Manitowoc, Wisconsin .

"(CNN) -- A trio of rare Snow Leopard cubs have made their public debut at a zoo in Switzerland this week. The as yet unnamed triplets, born in Basel Zoo eight weeks ago, were displayed on Wednesday with their proud parents. Mayhan, the cubs' mother, was paired with father Pator in 2009 as part of a Europe-wide zoo breeding program. The pregnancy was confirmed in January this year. The zoo said the cubs, who are still being suckled by their mother, are expected to remain in Basel for their first three years but will later travel as ambassadors for their endangered species. Snow leopards are usually found in the Himalayan ranges of central Asia at altitudes of up to 6,000 meters. The species has been pushed to the brink of extinction by farmers protecting their livestock and hunters who sell its fur and body parts, which are prized by some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. There are now an estimated 3,500 to 7,000 snow leopards left living in the wild, according to the Snow Leopard Trust.","Rare snow leopard triplets born eight weeks ago .

"Liverpool are close to sealing the first big-money move of the English close season after agreeing a fee for Sunderland midfielder Jordan Henderson. The 20-year-old already has an England cap to his name, playing for Fabio Capello's side in a friendly against France in November last year. Henderson is regarded as one of the brightest young talents in the English game and is going to cost the Anfield club a reported fee of $32 million, according to the UK Press Association, with French striker David Ngog going the other way. It shows that Liverpool's American owners, Fenway Sports Group -- who also own Major League baseball team the Boston Red Sox -- are prepared to spend big in the transfer market to try and haul Liverpool back into the English top four. Who will be football's top transfer targets? The club missed out on Champions League football in 2010-11, finishing sixth in the table, and even failed to secure a Europa League place for next season despite an upturn in fortunes after former player Kenny Dalglish returned as manager. A statement on the club's web site read: ""Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign Sunderland midfielder Jordan Henderson. ""The 20-year-old will today discuss personal terms and undergo a medical on Merseyside after a fee was agreed between the two clubs."" Sunderland also confirmed the news on their web site, a spokesman saying: ""A fee has been agreed with Liverpool for Jordan Henderson and he travels to Anfield with the club's blessing."" Henderson came through the ranks at Sunderland and made his debut for the club in the Premier League back in 2008. He is due to join up with England's Under-21 squad Wednesday ahead of the European Championships. Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn, a former player at the club, said: ""Jordan is a credit to himself, his family and Sunderland's Academy and everyone here wishes him the very best for the future,"" he said. ""I am pleased that we got the deal to a level that we felt was right for our club."" Meanwhile, Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has welcomed news that the club have been linked with Blackburn Rovers defender Phil Jones. The 19-year-old is also part of England's Under-21 European Championships squad and made his debut for Rovers in the English League Cup in 2009. Rooney said on his Twitter site: ""Phil Jones is a good young English player. One of the toughest defenders I played against last season. Can play midfield too."" He later added: ""I don't know if Phil Jones is signing for us, just saying he is a good player that's all. I haven't got a clue if he is signing or not."" In Germany, Bayern Munich have confirmed the signing of Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer on a five-year contract. ""I'm very happy in Germany, I'm the national team goalkeeper, and Bayern Munich is the best club in Germany. That's why I wanted to join Bayern,"" Neuer told the club's web site. ""I know exactly what I want. I'm looking forward to the next five years, and I don't know if it'll just be the five years. I'm sure it could be more.""","English club Liverpool agree fee for Sunderland midfielder Jordan Henderson .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Hi, everybody! I'm Tomeka Jones, and this is the first summer edition of CNN Student News! Where did E. Coli come from? JONES: Every week this summer, we'll be doing these special web shows. Today, we're talking about a story we covered toward the end of the school year: an outbreak of E. coli. That's a specific kind of bacteria. You can get it from contaminated food or water, and it can cause some pretty serious health problems. Officials say this outbreak is limited to an area around one city in Germany. So far, more than 20 people have died from the bacteria. Thousands of people have gotten sick from it. One of the big things officials are trying to figure out is where this E. coli came from. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is going to explain how scientists do that and what people can do to avoid getting sick. (BEGIN VIDEO) Dr. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It can be difficult sometimes to figure out exactly from where this came. You know, this is sort of a real medical investigation. They literally have to trace back from the farm to the fork all the different steps of these different foods. So, for example, bean sprouts being looked at right now. So far, 23 of 40 samples have come back negative. All that tells you is that, so far, they haven't found it. It doesn't mean that it wasn't there. And I can also tell you that sometimes you never get a clear answer as to exactly from where this bacteria originated. About 2,200 people infected; 60% of them women. 600 of them also got a very serious complication of this infection called HUS: hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Your blood doesn't clot as well. Your kidneys can start to fail. 70% of the people that developed that were also women. Unclear why that is. It could be that women are eating more of whatever the contaminated food was. For most people who get this infection, it's going to be a couple of bad days. Stomach cramping, stomach pains. They're not going to need antibiotics. But obviously, in a few people, as you're hearing about, the complications can be more severe. For the consumer, obviously, washing your hands, washing your food, not cross-contaminating your food: these are the things a consumer can do. But distributors, the manufacturers, the people who are getting this food to your table, they obviously have to take some responsibility here as well, in terms of making sure this food is free of contamination. (END VIDEO) E. Coli economic impact . JONES: The German government has been trying to control this outbreak and keep people from getting sick. One way is by putting out a warning about eating some raw vegetables. But that has a big impact on farmers. Fred Pleitgen looks at the economic side of this story. (BEGIN VIDEO) FRED PLEITGEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's a painful sight: case after case of ripe tomatoes thrown away. This produce marketer near Berlin says selling tomatoes has become all but impossible since the E. coli outbreak began. PETRA LACK, PRODUCTION MANAGER, WERDER FRUCHT: ""Things are awful at the moment,"" the manager says. ""We hope this won't continue for the whole harvest season. But if the government keeps telling people not to eat lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers, nothing will change."" PLEITGEN: German authorities are still warning not to eat those vegetables uncooked, and consumers seem to be heeding that warning. The company near Berlin says at one point, demand for tomatoes dropped to only five percent of what they normally sell. The folks here say, in total, they are going to have to destroy about 270 tons of tomatoes. That batch alone is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. And keep in mind, these are perfectly fine tomatoes. But they simply can't sell them because demand has flatlined. German authorities still have not found the source of the deadly E. coli strain in northern Germany. Officials believe it may have originated in this sprout farm, but so far, there is no scientific evidence to back that up. Farmers all over Europe are suffering as fearful consumers are staying away from vegetables. At a crisis meeting in Luxembourg, where especially Spain criticized Germany for suggesting its cucumbers might be the source of the bacteria, the EU agreed to pay 150 million Euros in financial aid for the industry. SÁNDOR FAZEKAS, HUNGARIAN MINISTER FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT: We have to pay compensation for the damages that they have suffered. We need a swift solution, and our commissioner came to our meeting with a set of proposals. PLEITGEN: Andre Becker would rather see his tomatoes on dinner tables than receive compensation for throwing them away. He oversees this green house, and the prime harvesting season is right now. Like so many others, he wants consumers to know his products are safe. ANDRE BECKER, HEAD OF PRODUCTION, HAVELIA VEGETABLES: ""We work according to strict standards,"" he says. ""We test the water we give to the plants, and we also tested for E. coli. The results were negative."" PLEITGEN: The tomatoes have grown exceptionally well this year. But no matter how beautiful and ripe they may be, the workers here know they will probably go straight from the green house to here, to be thrown away and destroyed. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Werder, Germany. (END VIDEO) Promo . JONES: Like we said before, we're doing these special web shows over the summer. But how are you spending your summer break? You can tell us on our blog. Or better yet, send in an iReport. And you can do both of those on our web site: CNNStudentNews.com. Goodbye . JONES: That's gonna wrap things up for now.

"(CNN) -- My decision to join the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) in college was not part of my life plan. I simply needed some science credits, and military science met the ""science"" requirement for liberal arts majors. It also looked a lot like gym class, which I was quite confident I could do without too much trouble. I am very glad that I was wrong about the whole thing! ROTC is about presenting you with challenges and testing you -- physically, mentally and emotionally. I jumped out of perfectly good airplanes, rappelled, solved problems and met some amazing people the 32 years I have served my country. I would not trade one minute of it! Yes, along the way, I encountered people who made snap judgments about me because I was shorter than them, a woman or an African-American. They decided I did not measure up, but I chose to ignore them and believe in myself. My family is full of people who are intelligent, resourceful, strong and stubborn -- traits I inherited and I am certain are the reason I have been able to succeed in life and to overcome people who put obstacles in my path. One of the most affirming moments in my life was the day I was promoted to brigadier general. The look of pride in my father's eyes is something I will never forget. If my mother had been alive, I know she would have had the same look. My father served in the Army Air Corps in the 1950s when he was denied the opportunities I have enjoyed. Men and women like him -- my mother, aunts, uncles, grandparents and great-grandparents -- suffered disappointments and indignities so that I could have choices and opportunities. So, this is NOT about me. It is about realizing their dreams. It is about opening doors for others. It is about living fearlessly every day.

"(CNN) -- European champions Barcelona claim they will sever ties with Real Madrid if their fierce Spanish rivals continue to push the ""bounds of sportsmanship."" The two clubs faced-off five times over the course of last season, culminating in two tempestuous Champions League semifinals in which players from both sides clashed on numerous occasions. Real coach Jose Mourinho was handed a five-match ban by UEFA after comments he made after the first leg of the tie, in which he claimed match officials favored Barcelona. He was also sent to the stands during the game at Real's Bernabeu stadium after criticizing the referee. Arsenal captain Fabregas: My future still to be decided . Real then claimed Barcelona's players had play-acted to con the referee, and that Sergio Busquets made racist comments to their Brazilian defender Marcelo -- a charge UEFA later dismissed. In a press conference on Thursday Barca president Sandro Rosell warned that his club would break ties with Real if next season was again punctuated by poor relations. ""Real Madrid and FC Barcelona are ancient institutions with many supporters and aficionados,"" Rosell said in a statement on the club's official web site. ""Real Madrid crossed the line of acceptable sporting rivalry by making accusations against our club without any foundation. ""If the limits of fair play are passed once again, we shall be obliged to end our institutional relations, something we have absolutely no desire to do. ""The rivalry will continue next season but we will not allow them to go beyond the bounds of sportsmanship."" Rosell also made reference to the ""numerous provocations"" made by Mourinho, pointing to the post-match press conference that landed him in hot water. The Portuguese this week appealed against his ban. He said: ""Comments by the protagonists have always served to enrich footballing debate. But this season a Real Madrid employee, its coach, also went beyond all the limits of necessary sporting rivalry. ""He even went as far as to say that our coach should feel ashamed of some of our victories. The press conference given by the Real Madrid coach after the first leg of the Champions League semi finals at the Bernabeu would certainly have made any sportsperson feel ashamed. ""He accused our club of having won titles thanks to some kind of national and international conspiracy, implicating in this conspiracy the good name of Unicef and the football authorities."" Barca's president went on to claim the club's season was the best in its history, after coach Pep Guardiola secured the Spanish league title to go with the club's fourth Champions League triumph. Rosell also hinted that Barcelona would be willing to spend big if the  right players became available, as speculation over Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas' future continues to grow. ""We'll see what happens in the transfer market. Initially, we have $63 million but we might use part of next year's money too,"" he said. ""Guardiola has his preferences, but he doesn't talk about names, he talks about positions that should be strengthened. ""Cesc? I guess he'd like to join us, like a lot of players would, but we won't go mad and offer silly fees. Last year we offered $56 million for Cesc, this season his value is less. What we can offer will also depend on his salary.""","Barcelona threaten to sever ties with their great rivals Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- Doctors Without Borders has embarked on a massive vaccination campaign in three African countries to combat an outbreak of meningitis that has killed hundreds of people, the organization said Wednesday. A child gets vaccinated against meningitis in Niger in August 2007. The vaccinations are being carried out in Niger, Nigeria, and Chad -- part of a large swath of what is known as the ""meningitis belt"" of sub-Saharan Africa, the organization said. The ""belt"" stretches from Senegal to Ethiopia. Doctors Without Borders, widely known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres, said medical teams have treated and vaccinated 5.4 million people and plan on vaccinating another 1.7 million -- making the vaccination campaign the organization's largest ever. The group said more than 1,900 people have died in this outbreak since January. More than 56,000 cases have been reported in Nigeria, Niger and Chad alone, the organization said. Last month, the World Health Organization said the disease was at epidemic level in 76 areas of in Niger and Nigeria, and a spokesman in Nigeria, Dr. Olaokun Soyinka, said the outbreak was ""bigger than usual."" In March, the organization said a total of 24,868 suspected cases had been reported in the ""meningitis belt,"" including 1,513 deaths. The outbreak began around the start of the year, Soyinka told CNN. It usually peaks in the dry season because of dust, winds and cold nights, before dipping around May when the rains come, he said. Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord, according to the World Health Organization. Several different bacteria can cause meningitis but Neisseria meningitidis -- which is to blame for the current outbreak -- is one of the most important because of its potential to cause epidemics.","Doctors Without Borders embark on vaccination campaign to combat outbreak .

"(CNN) -- Canadian authorities are trying to determine what caused a jetliner to crash near the remote Arctic outpost of Resolute Bay, killing 12 people. The jet, operated by Ontario-based carrier First Air, went down about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the airport on Saturday, First Air Vice President Chris Ferris told reporters Sunday. The dead included the four-member crew and eight of the 11 passengers aboard the Boeing 737-200, he said. ""At this time, the cause of the accident is unknown,"" he said. ""The Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation, and First Air is cooperating fully."" Two of the three survivors were flown to Ottawa, more than 2,000 miles away, for further treatment, Ferris said. His voice cracked as he thanked Canadian troops for assisting in rescue efforts. First Air flight 6560 was lost about 12:40 p.m. Saturday, about 10 minutes after its last reported communication with controllers, the airline reported. The flight took off from Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories. Firefighters, medical teams, police and members of the Canadian military were among the first to respond to the accident, according to Dominique Verdon, a spokeswoman with Canada's Department of National Defence. Authorities recovered the jet's flight recorders at the crash site, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported Saturday. Boeing offered its ""deepest sympathies"" to the families of the victims and said Canadian investigators have asked it to provide technical assistance for the investigation.

"(CNN) -- Englishman Oliver Fisher earned his maiden European Tour victory with a two-stroke success in the Czech Open in Ostrava on Sunday. The 22-year-old, who turned professional at 18 after becoming the youngest-ever Briton to earn a place on the European Tour in 2006, carded a final round three- under-par 69 for a total of 275 (-13). Halfway leader Mikael Lundberg of Sweden also posted a 69 to finish clear in second place, while Paraguay's Fabrizio Zanotti recorded a superb final round 66 to finish third another two shots behind the winner. Fisher had started the final round level with Scotland's Steven O'Hara at the top of the leaderboard, but O'Hara slumped to a closing 75 as Fisher held off the challenge of Lundberg -- securing victory with a superb 25-foot birdie putt on the par-five 17th hole. The victory came as something of a surprise after Fisher missed 20 of his first 21 cuts this season, although he had shown some improvement in recent events in Sweden and Ireland. ""Getting your first win is obviously special, especially as I've struggled so far this season. My form has been horrific, but golf's a funny game,"" Fisher told the official European Tour website. ""I went through a lot of different emotions out there today. I hit it well on the range this morning, so that gave me confidence,"" added Fisher. Meanwhile, Webb Simpson fired a six-under-par 64 to claim a two-shot lead after three rounds of the Wyndham Championship in Greensboro, North Carolina. Simpson, who hails from North Carolina, lies on a 15-under-par total of 195 to hold an advantage over halfway leader Tommy Gainey, who posted a 69.","Oliver Fisher claims a two-stroke victory in the Czech Open on Sunday .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Laura Hathaway initially had no regrets after getting a tattoo on her lower back when she was 21. But now, 10 years later, she wants it gone. Tattoo removal is more painful than the original tattoo, patient Laura Hathaway says. The pharmaceutical sales representative from Atlanta, Georgia, says it doesn't fit in with her current lifestyle as the mother of a 2-year-old boy who just started to talk. ""The other day I bent over and he said, 'What's that?' and it just confirms why I'm having it removed."" Dr. Scott Karempelis of Atlanta Dermatology Associates is performing a multitreatment laser procedure that will gradually erase Hathaway's tattoo with little or no scarring. The process is painful, expensive and time-consuming. Karempelis says that in spite of the drawbacks, ""business is booming."" He and three other dermatologists in his office see more than 30 patients a day who want tattoos removed by laser.  Watch Hathaway's tattoo beginning to disappear » . The American Academy of Dermatology reports tattoo regret is common in the United States. Among a group of 18- to 50-year-olds surveyed in 2004, 24 percent reported having a tattoo and 17 percent of those considered getting their tattoo removed. Karempelis uses a state-of-the-art laser that targets the pigment in the tattoo. ""It goes through the skin without damaging it and hits the pigment depending on which wavelength and which color you have, and it blows it into small pieces."" The tattoo ink is then reabsorbed into the body through the lymphatic system. The process must be completed over several sessions in order to protect the skin from damage. Hathaway expects to go through 10 sessions several weeks apart, each lasting less than a minute. She admits it's a lot more painful than getting the original tattoo. ""It's prickly,"" describes Hathaway. ""It feels like a bee is sitting on your back stinging time and time again. Afterwards, the pain does go away and you're a little sore for a few hours."" Patients with bigger tattoos are sometimes given the option to use a topical anesthetic, but Karempelis points out that it adds to the cost. Like other dermatologists, he charges by the square inch for the laser treatment. By the time Hathaway's done, she expects to pay more than $2,200. There's no guarantee that she won't have a scar. ""Scarring is your major risk,"" says Karempelis. ""Almost everyone gets a little bit of discoloration, a little lighter, a little darker for a while. But in most cases if you wait a year, you cannot see where it was done initially."" Certain tattoo colors, such as green, yellow and purple, are harder to remove, Karempelis says, especially for people with darker skin. Some parts of the body also pose a challenge. ""The farthest away from the heart are hardest to treat, so the ankles are the toughest,"" Karempelis says. He predicts his business will increase in the future, after a new type of tattoo ink hits the market. Freedom-2 is a microencapsulated dye. It's designed to be easily removed by a single laser treatment. ""The laser would hit that pigment and it would completely dissolve immediately. ... You wouldn't need repetitive treatments,"" the doctor says. But until the ink becomes available, Karempelis expects to see a variety of patients going through long sessions to remove reminders of their past. He says the most popular tattoos to be removed in his office are the names of old boyfriends and former spouses. In Hathaway's case, her tattoo of a flower didn't fit the image she wants to portray. She says she got the tattoo long before low-rise pants became popular. ""It's just something I wanted to be private and now it's not."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Honduran President Porfirio ""Pepe"" Lobo has said that there are ""high up"" forces in his country that want him killed, but declined to give details. At an impromptu press conference at an event Monday, Lobo was asked by reporters why the presidential home was undergoing security upgrades, including the installation of a perimeter wall. ""It's unfortunate, but these safety measures must be taken, even more so when they are threatening me,"" Lobo said. ""They say that they shouldn't remove (me) because it's too problematic. Better to send someone to kill him."" The president added that he knows ""who they are and they are not low down, they are high up."" The threats stemmed from a new security tax that would be collected and used to fund police operations, Lobo said. The tax would collect about $78 million. The wall being built around the presidential home was being donated by the Taiwanese government, he said. Lobo assumed the presidency in 2010, the first leader elected after a 2009 coup that ousted former President Manuel Zelaya.","There are people who want him dead, the president says .

"(CNN) -- Both Mainz and Hanover lost their 100% German Bundesliga records on Sunday, with Mainz thrashed 4-2 at home by Schalke and Hanover being held 1-1 at home by Hertha Berlin. Mainz, who blazed a trail at the top this time last year, won their first two matches of the new campaign -- and looked to be heading for a third straight victory after Andreas Ivanschitz and Colombian midfielder Elkin Soto scored within the opening 12 minutes to give them a 2-0 lead. But Schalke roared back with four goals in 33 second-half minutes through Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, captain Benedikt Hoewedes, Cameroon midfielder Joel Matip and Austrian defender Christian Fuchs. The result lifted Schalke up to fourth in the table, while Mainz are eighth, and gave the Gelsenkirchen-based side a further boost following the news that star striker Raul has committed his future to the club. Meanwhile, midfielder Sergio Pinto put Hanover ahead with a 33rd-minute free-kick, only for teenager Pierre-Michel Lasogga to level matters for Hertha seven minutes from time. The result sees Hanover second behind surprise leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach on goal difference, with Hertha in 13th place. However, there is just one point between the top nine clubs following a very open start to the season. Meanwhile, in France, big-spending Paris Saint-Germain claimed their first success of the season with a 2-1 win over Valenciennes. With $60m new signing, Javier Pastore, making his debut, PSG took a 39th minute lead through Kevin Gameiro. However, the visitors equalized on the stroke of half-time when Remi Gomis headed home Renaud Cohade's cross. But the hosts secured victory just past the hour mark when Nene netted from the penalty spot after David Ducourtioux handled. But it is Montpellier who lead Ligue One with the only 100% record after three matches, following a thumping 4-0 win over Rennes. Substitute Souleymane Diawara scored two late goals to secure victory for Montpellier, who lead Toulouse and St Etienne by two points at the top of the table.","Mainz and Hanover both lose their 100% German Bundesliga records .

Tottenham, who had their opening Premier League clash against Everton postponed due the recent London riots, nevertheless looked much the sharper as they raced into a 3-0 lead by half time. It took just five minutes for Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart to take advantage of some calamitous defending to poke Tottenham 1-0 in front before Jermain Defoe and 21-year-old Jake Livermore, scoring his first goal for his club, put the tie beyond the Edinburgh club.

Elsewhere Europe's leading clubs fared badly. Helsinki pulled off arguably the biggest shock of the night by beating German side Shalke 2-0 in Finland.

"(CNN) -- The severe storms that pummeled much of the South on Monday night left at least eight people dead in three states, officials said Tuesday. Local authorities reported one death in Mississippi, six in Georgia and one in Tennessee. Severe winds and pounding rain also toppled trees and power lines, knocking out electricity in some areas. Mississippi had one fatality when a tree falling into the road hit a 20-year-old man, said Copiah County coroner Ellis Stuart. Damage was reported in 20 counties, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said. In Georgia, 70 counties reported damage, as did 43 in Tennessee, according to state emergency management agencies.

"Watts, California (CNN) -- One savings account at a time, ""Sweet"" Alice Harris is trying to save youths from the temptations of crime and violence in Los Angeles' notoriously troubled neighborhood of Watts. Harris, 76, is a humanitarian with a big mission on the most modest of budgets. Twice a year, she tries to instill the importance of saving money for college by offering any youth $5 -- if and only if the youngsters place that money in a savings account. While some may doubt whether such a notion could succeed, Harris can count 40 youngsters who took up her offer over the past three years -- and are now going to junior college. ""The majority of the people who've opened an account have stayed in school,"" said Harris at her community center called Parents of Watts (POW), a nonprofit youth outreach group she began in 1979 to keep kids off the streets and in school. On Saturday, Harris held her latest ""back-to-school community event,"" in which 96 kids applied for a savings account that holds $5, donated by Harris' organization. In exchange for accepting the $5, the youngsters have to pledge that the money will be used for their college education and that the youths will contribute to their own savings over time, Harris said. Harris, who has been living in Watts at least since its 1960s riots, said the savings account program teaches youths discipline and the importance of savings -- as well as letting them know she and her group are there to support their college dreams. Harris operates her micro-giving program through Kinecta Federal Credit Union and Nix Financial. Ariel Flowers, 16, was one of the many to open an account Saturday. She hopes to save the money for college, because she says, ""Pepperdine costs a lot of money."" Through summer jobs and babysitting in the next few years, she hopes to make her dream possible and wishes to open up her own business one day. Danielle Sandoval, 13, of Downey, California, signed up for one of the $5 accounts two years ago and now she has saved $700, through an allowance from her mother and cash gifts to her during her birthdays and Christmas. She dreams of attending California State University at Long Beach -- and wants to become a veterinarian. ""The other kids, maybe, they want to be spoiled. I want to be independent, buy my own car and buy my own house,"" Danielle said at the community center, near a booth set up by the banks. Harris said Danielle is a model saver: the West Middle School student has saved the most in the program over a two-year period. In addition to being on her school's honor role, the girl was given another honor Saturday; Kinecta and Nix Financial awarded her an additional $250 to put in her savings account. ""We want to keep encouraging her to save,"" said Mel Calloway, the executive vice president of Kinecta and Nix Financial. ""We were very proud of her, she had a lot of discipline in her savings."" Harris said she gives out the money for the savings accounts through the donations she receives through her community group. She feels strongly about the programs she runs because of the inspiration she personally received: it was her own mentor who opened up Harris's savings account for her decades ago. ""It helped me go to beauty college. What she did for me, I do for these kids. I know what it's like to feel like nothing,"" Harris said. Harris hopes the kids will finish college. ""I envision that they won't go to jail, they won't gang bang,"" she said. For Harris, the Watts riots aren't forgotten: 46 years after the violence, the neighborhood still faces deep problems. Capt. Phil Tingirides of the Los Angeles police's southeast station said that Watts ""is a very hard community and influenced by violent street gangs."" The four housing projects in Watts have traditionally been violent, with large amounts of drug dealing, he said. But he applauds how ""Sweet"" Alice is pushing the youth in the community to be financially independent. Regarding the $5 that Harris donates, Tingirides stated: ""It's very symbolic on one hand and on the other hand, probably more money than anyone's legitimately ever given many of them.""","""Sweet"" Alice Harris of Watts, California, gives $5 to any kid who wants a saving account .

"(Mental Floss) -- Ben & Jerry's Bagels? Sonic Steakhouse? Be glad that some of our favorite quick-service places evolved into what they are today. 1. When Ben and Jerry decided to go into business, they really wanted to make bagels. But the equipment required to make bagels was rather expensive, so they researched a cheaper product and settled on ice cream. Although they've released plenty of other breakfast-related ice cream flavors -- Cinnamon Buns, Coffee & Biscotti and Maple Grape Nut among them -- they have yet to create a lox and bagel-flavor. Maybe it's in production? 2. Glen Bell, the founder of Taco Bell (who knew the ""Bell"" represented a person?), started his career in the fast food business with a meager hot dog stand. It did so well that he sold it and opened a bigger and better stand, and he started selling tacos for 19 cents out of a side window. Before long, the hot dogs were playing second banana to the tacos, and Bell decided to switch the business. Mental Floss: 10 secret fast food menu items . 3. What if Tim Hortons' Timbits actually referred to chicken nuggets? It could have gone that way -- the ex-hockey player originally focused his post pro-sports career on hamburgers and opened a few burger joints in Toronto and North Bay. They didn't do so well. They retooled the concept and reopened as a small doughnut shop housed in an old gas station, selling coffee for 25 cents and doughnuts for 69 cents per dozen. Today, Tim Hortons employs 100,000 people and has more than 3,000 stores (mostly in Canada, but the company is expanding into the U.S.) 4. What if Dunkin' Donuts had a fleet of vehicles that drove around like the ice cream man, selling sweet, sweet carbs to anyone who could scrounge up some change? Well, they used to, sort of. After working for just such an ice cream company, William Rosenberg used his war bonds and borrowed some money to start a mobile catering business that delivered breakfast and lunch to factory workers. He noticed that his best sellers by far were coffee and doughnuts, and decided to base the whole business around them. Seems to have worked out OK. (I still like the idea of doughnuts coming to me, though.) 5. On the other hand, Al Copeland, who created Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits, started out in the doughnut biz and ended up in poultry. He sold his car to purchase a Tastee Donut franchise from his brother and then decided to fry chicken instead of crullers. The first one failed, even with the tagline ""So fast you get your chicken before you get your change."" But the second version succeeded, making him a multimillionaire. The name, by the way, came from Popeye Doyle from ""The French Connection"" -- not Popeye the Sailor Man. Mental Floss: 15 companies that originally sold something else . 6. How about a Sonic Steakhouse? The founder, Troy Smith, had big plans for an upscale steak eatery when he originally entered the restaurant business. He opened a small diner called Troy's Pan Full of Chicken to generate revenue for the bigger steakhouse and realized somewhere in the middle of things that he was making a load of money selling just root beer, hamburgers and hot dogs every week. He decided to stick with the low-brow menu and scrap the sirloin. 7. Wilbur Hardee, obviously the founder of Hardee's, ran several inn-style restaurants in North Carolina and took that time to study the habits of his patrons. He got rid of the inns and opened his first quick-service place, selling 15-cent hamburgers under the Hardee's name until the chain was purchased by Carl's Jr. in 1997. 8. Speaking of Carl's Jr., Carl Karcher came from similar humble beginnings. Like a lot of the great fast-food giants, Karcher started with a hot dog stand he and his wife purchased by taking a $311 loan out on their car. They also sold tamales. Somehow, I don't think Paris Hilton biting into a big, juicy tamale would have had quite the same effect as Paris Hilton biting into a big, juicy Six Dollar Burger, do you? 9. Chick-fil-A started out as Dwarf Grill (now Dwarf House), a full-service restaurant housed in a tiny little building with a tiny little door. The original can still be found in Hapeville, Georgia, complete with diminutive door (it has a regular door as well). What might be shocking to Chick-fil-A die-hards is that the Dwarf Houses offer steakburgers and hamburgers. Gasp!! What would the ""Eat Mor Chikin"" cows think?! Mental Floss: Was there really a Granny Smith? Fruit and veggie origins . 10. Finally, of course, there's McDonald's. Like our other frankfurter entrepreneurs, Dick and Mac McDonald started with a mere hot dog stand in Monrovia, California. They upgraded, but burgers weren't really their main focus -- they planned to capitalize on their delicious BBQ. They were mistaken. Several years later, they noticed that burgers were the item keeping the store alive and decided to switch exclusively to burgers, shakes, and fries. These days, I suppose they do a little bit of all of that, and more (yes, even the McHotDog). For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN)  -- Amidst reports that the Samsung may be touting inflated numbers for sales of its Galaxy Tab tablet -- and reports that those that do buy the device are returning it at an alarming rate -- one might jump to the conclusion that Apple has little to be worried about in the way of competitors to its iPad. However, that would be a mistake. While Apple sold nearly 15 million iPads in 2010 and closed the year with 75% market share in the tablet space, that was down from 95% in the third quarter of 2010, before the Galaxy Tab went on sale. And regardless of whether or not the Galaxy Tab is a hit or a dud -- Samsung claims its return rate is actually 2% -- a slew of better Android devices are about to invade the market -- not to mention offerings from other players including RIM and Palm. One advantage that upcoming tablets like the Motorola Xoom have on the Galaxy Tab is that they'll be using Honeycomb, Google's operating system that's optimized for tablets that was officially revealed on Wednesday. Believe it or not, the Galaxy tablet is running an older version of Android that's designed to run on smartphones, which essentially renders the device as an awkwardly sized Galaxy S. Also, let us not forget recent history. It was less than two years ago that pundits were beginning to suggest that Android was a failure. At the time, there were only two Android smartphones on the market, despite the dozens of partners that Google had announced at the launch of Android in late 2007. To many, the features of the nascent operating system also seemed underwhelming. Fast forward to today and Android smartphones are outselling iPhones, thanks to the multitude of manufacturers now offering devices at a variety of price points -- all the way down to free. Gizmodo says: ""If you consider where Android was when it started versus how far it's advanced in 18 months with Android 2.2, you might get brain freeze."" All of which should signal that the tablet race is far from over. The next few months will see not only the introduction of the Xoom, but also devices from manufacturers like LG, Vizio and Acer. Much like smartphones, having more than one manufacturer to choose from is one of Android's big advantages, as each device offers its own unique features that consumers can weigh when making their selection. That's no different in tablets, where consumers will be able to choose based on things like operating system, screen size and front-facing cameras, not to mention price. And price could ultimately prove a huge driver of sales of iPad alternatives. Whereas Apple and its carrier partners, AT&T and Verizon, have thus far offered data plans for the iPad on a month-to-month basis, T-Mobile is enticing customers with a $249 retail price when you sign a two-year data contract for the Galaxy Tab. While the contract-less iPad has its advantages, namely the ability to switch devices more than every two years, it also means you'll need to drop at least $629 initially to get a 3G version of the tablet. Meanwhile, much like we saw with netbooks, pricing is likely to drop further -- perhaps all the way to free -- as carriers look to lock in customers on their expensive new 4G data networks and manufacturers churn out devices with lower manufacturing costs -- something Vizio, for example, does well. An iPad 2 (very likely) and subsidized pricing (less likely) could give Apple another pop in the middle of this year, but make no mistake: The same tides that lifted Android past iOS in the smartphone world will soon do the same with tablets. That's not to say that Apple won't continue to build a huge, lucrative and ever-growing market for itself, but rather to point out the inevitability of its competitors also cashing in on the tablet craze. The opinions expressed here are solely those of Adam Ostrow.","It's a mistake to think Apple has little to be worried about in the way of competitors .

"(CNN) -- ""Ninety percent of the people that live in this holler are coal miners or retired coal miners,"" 48-year-old James Dials explains as he winds his pickup through the mountains of southern West Virginia. The rear window of the truck is emblazoned with large decals of a CAT truck, a mountain peak and a bulldozer. He is a proud coal miner. ""As far as I can remember, I never dreamed of being anything else,"" he says. He grew up in tiny Sharples, West Virginia, where he fished for trout, hunted deer and rode motorbikes around Blair Mountain. His extended family still lives here, and he has no intention of leaving. ""If I were to leave here and go to a city, I would be lost trying to do factory work,"" says Dials, the son and grandson of coal miners. ""I'm not going to say I wouldn't try, but I probably wouldn't stay with it."" But Dials, who loves this quiet, small-town, country life, finds himself in the middle of a loud, high stakes fight between coal companies, politicians, environmentalists and impassioned activists. The debate is over mountaintop coal removal, or MTR. See how contentious the battle for Blair Mountain became . Scott Simonton, a civil and environmental engineer who teaches at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, explains the process of coal companies cutting off the top of a mountain to remove coal: ""They will take hundreds of feet off the top of a mountain to get to a few feet of coal."" See the impact of mountain top removal from both sides . In 2009, Lisa Jackson, then the newly appointed administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, placed MTR permits under review so her agency could determine if the projects would pollute area water. ""They need to understand,"" she says, referring to the coal companies, ""yeah you can mine coal, you can give jobs to people, but you can't do it at the expense of their lives, their health, their water, their air, that's too much."" Since then, nearly all new mountaintop removal permits have been frozen. Poll: Majority oppose mountaintop removal coal mining . The environmental agency's permit review set off a battle for the future of mountaintop mining in West Virginia: the coal industry and its supporters on one side, environmentalists and people concerned about the health effects of mining on the other. Dials works mainly in mountaintop removal, driving a rock truck and helping rebuild the mountain slopes destroyed by blasting. To him, MTR permits mean more work. No new MTR permits means jobs like his will eventually dry up. Read more about the march on Blair Mountain . West Virginia University public health associate professor Michael Hendryx has been studying the health effects of mining in Appalachia for five years. ""I think it really is the biggest public health problem that West Virginia faces,"" he says. Recent studies he's published linked  ""multiple illnesses and multiple health outcomes that are problematic in mining areas. Higher rates of cancer is one of them. Higher forms of chronic heart disease, heart attacks, and lung disease like (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), kidney disease,"" he says. ""We have found evidence for all of those."" But Bill Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Association and a lobbyist for the coal industry, takes issue with Hendryx's studies. ""I think what you find is there is a correlation as opposed to a causation and it's got to be analyzed,"" he says. He believes the studies raise more questions than answers. The answer to this fight in West Virginia might be easier to find if there were other opportunities for men like James Dials. But there are few. ""That's the only jobs in the area,"" says Dials' wife, Linda. There are no other jobs in the area for men with his experience and education that would provide his current salary, about $65,000 per year. Activists against mountaintop coal removal often say diversifying West Virginia's economy is a way to increase jobs in the area. But the Dialses believe that is not a short-term solution. ""There are factories everywhere shutting down,"" Linda Dials says. ""What could they put here that would even come remotely close to being what coal and the industry of coal can do for the people of West Virginia?"" The unemployment rate in West Virginia is 8.5%. Even if James Dials was willing to move from southern West Virginia -- he's not -- recent Bureau of Labor Statistics findings say there are nearly five unemployed people for every one job available nationally. Historian Chuck Keeney, an instructor at Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College, believes he has the answer. ""They can mine the coal around Blair Mountain and they can get all the coal out without using mountaintop removal,"" he says. Keeney prefers underground mining to mountaintop removal and is a leader in the fight to save Blair Mountain from the mining method. The mountain was the site of a massive coal miner uprising in 1921, one that eventually allowed the coalfields of southern West Virginia to be unionized. ""They may not make as big a profit ...,"" he says, referring to the coal companies, ""because they will have to hire more miners."" While underground mining jobs do employ about 25% more miners than aboveground -- or surface mining -- jobs, not all MTR projects can be carried out by traditional underground mining. Sometimes the coal is too close to the peak to be reached safely that way. But there is a larger trend: Coal jobs in the state are drying up. In the 1940s, about 130,000 men made their living by mining ""black gold."" Now that number is around 22,000, according to the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration. The administration's projections show that by 2035, coal production in West Virginia will decrease by 40% and require thousands fewer miners. Improved technology has led to the decline. So has economics: It's cheaper and easier to mine in Wyoming, which is now the top coal state, producing 400 million tons a year, four times what's mined in West Virginia. So what's a man like James Dials supposed to do? ""I've got to work,"" James Dials says. ""That is the bottom line, I have got to work."" Rob Howell and Dave Timko contributed to this report.","Miners like James Dials say mountaintop removal coal mining preserves jobs .

"(CNN) -- China evacuated more than 600,000 residents along coastal areas and sent ships back to port as it braced for Tropical Storm Muifa, which pounded some areas with gusty winds and rains over the weekend, state media reported Sunday. Muifa, once a typhoon, weakened Saturday and was eventually downgraded to a tropical storm. It spared the financial hub of Shanghai as it brushed past it. Rain and strong winds hit the city, however. Landfall was expected Monday evening local time in Liaoning province. But even as the storm weakened, authorities cancelled flights and ordered thousands of fishing boats to remain anchored in the eastern coastal province of Shandong, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Police rescued dozens of tourists stranded on an island off the port of Qingdao as water levels rose, submerging a bridge to the mainland, according to Xinhua. The heaviest rain was over water Sunday. The storm was scheduled make landfall in Liaoning province Monday evening. Eastern coastal areas can expect high winds over the next few days, Xinhua said.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and top Pentagon officials including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen attended Tuesday's dignified transfer of the remains of 38 U.S. and Afghan personnel killed on board a helicopter shot down in Afghanistan over the weekend. Obama boarded both of the planes that transported the remains to the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to pay his respects and later joined Panetta, Mullen and U.S. Special Operations Commander Adm. William McRaven in meeting with more than 200 family members and colleagues of the slain service members at a building on the air base, according to background information provided by White House staff members accompanying the president on the trip. Panetta, Mullen and the chiefs of the Navy and Army were among the 11 senior military and Defense Department officials who also attended the dignified transfer, Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said. Because the catastrophic nature of the crash made the remains difficult to identify, all were brought in more than 38 transfer cases to the United States, Lapan said. The Afghan remains will be returned to their families once identifications can be made. The slain U.S. service members represent the worst single-incident loss of American life since the start of the Afghan war. Thirty Americans died in the crash, including 22 Navy SEALs, military officials said. Two U.S. military officials said Tuesday that Panetta has been asked by Special Operations commanders not to release the names of the slain Navy SEALs because they belonged to a covert unit. Even though many of the families have come forward and publicly identified their loved ones, the concern is that families and friends could be tracked down if they are identified, the officials said. According to the officials, they cannot recall a time when names were not released 24 hours after next of kin were notified following an incident. Initial reports on the incident said it occurred when a U.S. Army Ranger unit became pinned down by insurgents in the rugged Tangi Valley area of Wardak province in central eastern Afghanistan. The group called in assistance but instead had to race to the crash scene of a downed NATO helicopter carrying their reinforcements, officials said Monday. Everyone inside the CH-47 Chinook helicopter was killed, NATO reported. Helicopter pilot's son: Don't forget about my dad . However, a U.S. military official confirmed Tuesday that the SEALs were called in as an 'immediate reaction force"" when the Army Rangers who were on the ground in a firefight saw some Taliban break off and begin to escape. The Rangers wanted the SEALs to go after those insurgents, the official said, adding the Rangers were ""not pinned down"" but simply wanted more combat power. The inbound helicopter transporting the SEALs also carried a civilian interpreter and seven Afghan troops, and it crashed after being ""reportedly fired on by an insurgent rocket-propelled grenade."" On Monday, the two military transport aircraft carrying the remains departed Bagram airfield and headed to Dover Air Force Base. The flights arrived Tuesday morning, Lapan confirmed. Van Williams, the public affairs chief for Air Force Mortuary Operations, said all of the 38 sets of remains were ""unidentifiable."" ""The crash they were in was so horrific and the state of remains such that there was no easy way to see this was this person or this was that person,"" Williams told reporters. In a typical dignified transfer ceremony, family members and military carry teams board the plane, Williams said, adding that a chaplain may be asked to speak. The carry team then picks up the transfer case, and the command is given to render honors, according to Williams. The official party and everyone within earshot salutes as the remains are taken from the aircraft to a waiting vehicle for transport to the mortuary, where positive identification occurs, he said. ""For us ... it is a very big source of pride and a sense of duty and honor that we give to the fallen service members and their families,"" Williams said. ""We represent the nation, and a grateful nation at that."" In an earlier statement, the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, Gen. John R. Allen, paid tribute to the fallen. ""In life they were comrades in arms, and in death they are bound forever in this vital cause. We cherish this selfless sacrifice,"" Allen's statement said. ""Today, as we pay our respects to these magnificent troops, we recommit ourselves for the future, and for the freedom, peace and stability of Afghanistan."" Obama has been meeting with U.S. military officials about the incident and spoke with Afghan President Hamid Karzai by phone Sunday. ""We will press on, and we will succeed,"" Obama said Monday, adding that ""now is also a time to reflect on those we lost"" and on the sacrifices of all who have served, as well as their families. ""Their loss is a stark reminder of the risks that our men and women in uniform take every single day on behalf of their country,"" Obama said, discussing the incident at the end of televised remarks focused on the economy. Until Monday, military officials had been largely tight-lipped about the circumstances surrounding the crash, which occurred roughly 60 miles southwest of Kabul. The events leading up to the crash began when insurgents -- armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and AK-47 assault rifles -- engaged in small-arms fire with coalition forces on the ground, NATO reported. ISAF forces were carrying out an operation targeting a known Taliban leader in the area. Several militants were killed in the gunbattle, officials said. Coalition troops called in additional forces to assist in the operation as the firefight continued. ""The recent fighting season has not materialized as the insurgents had predicted,"" NATO spokesman Brig. Gen. Carsten Jacobsen told reporters in Kabul. ""But the insurgents are resilient and far from defeated."" An investigation is under way, Jacobsen said. On Tuesday, the commanding general at U.S. Central Command, James Mattis, announced in a statement that U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Colt was investigating the circumstances surrounding the crash. CNN's David Ariosto and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: All the remains are ""unidentifiable"" for now, an official says .

"(CNN)  -- Beverly Hills, California, police want Lindsay Lohan to turn herself in on an arrest warrant issued Friday. Lindsay Lohan was placed on three years' probation after being convicted of drunken driving in 2007. A police official told CNN on Saturday that officers will be on the lookout for the actress-singer until she does so. It wasn't clear why Lohan was being sought, but the warrant, issued by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge in Beverly Hills, apparently stems from her 2007 convictions for drunken driving, Beverly Hills police Sgt. Mike Foxen said. She is serving three years' probation for those convictions. ""We're hoping that she will turn herself in,"" Foxen said. Calls to Lohan's publicist and manager have not been returned. Once arrested, Lohan, 22, could go free after posting a $50,000 bond, Foxen said. Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on driving under the influence charges, with a cocaine possession charge in the second incident. The first arrest in May came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a Beverly Hills curb. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehab facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police saying Lohan was trying to run her down in a car. A judge sentenced Lohan to three years' probation after she entered guilty and no-contest pleas to the charges. She served less than two hours in jail. Lohan's acting career, which started at age 10 on a soap opera, took off on the big screen a year later when she played identical twins in Disney's ""The Parent Trap."" Since then, she has starred in at least a dozen movies, including ""Mean Girls"" and ""Georgia Rule"" with Jane Fonda in 2007. Her pop music recording career, boosted by her movie roles, has floundered. She last released an album in 2005.

"(CNN) -- For the first time in five years, a relief agency dedicated to refugees airlifted emergency aid into the Somali capital of Mogadishu on Monday, according to a spokesman. The flight left from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Monday morning with 31 metric tons (more than 34 U.S. tons) of emergency supplies and arrived in Mogadishu early Monday afternoon, said Andy Needham from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The aid flight comes just days after Islamic insurgents fled Mogadishu after a heated battle with government and African Union forces. But the trip has nothing to do with improved security, Needham said. ""We took the unprecedented decision to take the airlift for speed due to the famine,"" he said. Needham said the group has warehouses across Somalia and would ""normally re-stock them over land."" But the agency shifted logistics in reaction to starving people flocking to Mogadishu. Monday's plane carried almost 2,500 emergency assistance packages. Each package contains an improvised tent sheet, sleeping mats, blankets, water containers and food utensils. ""The supplies will be distributed almost immediately,"" Needham said. At least two more supply flights are in the pipeline. The next, which is due to land Thursday, will be similar to Monday's delivery. The third flight will include ""high-energy biscuits."" Also Monday, the White House announced that U.S. President Barack Obama approved an additional $105 million for relief efforts in the Horn of Africa. ""U.S. assistance will continue funding the urgently needed food, health, shelter, water and sanitation assistance to those who desperately need help,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. About 100,000 Somalis have flocked to Mogadishu in search of food and potable water, which have disappeared in a devastating famine and drought, according to the U.N. They join more than 370,000 internal refugees already in the capital in war-torn southern Somalia, many of whom also face hunger. The UNHCR is calling for more private and government donations for emergency operations in the Horn of Africa, warning that a lack of funds threatens future aid. The aid organization says it needs $145 million to cover operations through the end of the year, adding that it has received 45% of that amount so far. The U.N. declared famine in five areas of southern Somalia in June, including Mogadishu. In all, about 12 million people in the Horn of Africa region need assistance. Somalia is the worst hit.","NEW: Obama approves additional $105 million in aid for Horn of Africa .
