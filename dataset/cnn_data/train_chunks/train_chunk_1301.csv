"Southampton striker Graziano Pelle scored on his debut as Italy maintained their 100 per cent start in qualifying for Euro 2016. Pelle put Italy ahead in the 24th minute when he poked the ball home after Pasqual's header had sparked a goalmouth scramble. Both Malta and Italy ended with 10 men. Malta captain Michael Mifsud was shown a controversial direct red card for a foul on Alessandro Florenzi in the 27th minute even though TV replays showed there was a minimal contact. Graziano Pelle (second right) scores the winner for Italy in the Euro 2016 Group H qualifier against Malta . Southampton striker Pelle celebrates after scoring on his debut for the Azzurri on Monday night . Malta: Hogg, Zach Muscat, Agius, Camilleri, Mintoff (Baldacchino 72), Rowen Muscat,Failla (Bezzina 90), Briffa,Paul Fenech, Mifsud, Schembri (Cohen 85) Subs Not Used: Haber, Grioli, Scicluna, Ryan Fenech, Kristensen, Pisani, Terence Vella, Farrugia, Nicholas Vella .

Italy: Buffon, Darmian, Bonucci, Chiellini, Candreva, Verratti, Pasqual, Florenzi (Aquilani 59), Marchisio, Immobile (Giovinco 65), Pelle (Ogbonna 76) Subs Not Used: Sirigu, De Sciglio, Poli, Parolo, Pirlo, Zaza, Destro,Perin .

Ref: Ovidiu Alin Hategan (Romania) Minnows Malta, 155 in the FIFA rankings, put up stiff defensive resistance the rest of the way and Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci was sent off for foul on Andre Schembri whehn he was last man in the 73rd minute. Bonucci will have to miss Italy's next Euro 2016 qualifier against Croatia on November 16 in Milan. Croatia and Italy lead with nine points each after three games. 'Having points in the table should give us confidence,' Italy coach Antonio Conte said. 'We won but we could have been more decisive in front of the goal. There's margin for improvement.' Italy has won all four of its matches - including a friendly against the Netherlands - under Conte, who is yet to call up Mario Balotelli. 'We need to improve and we can improve,' Conte said. 'But four wins give us confidence.' The top two finishers from the nine groups qualify automatically. The best third-placed team also qualifies automatically, and the other eight can qualify through a playoff. Italy also struggled somewhat against Malta in their last two meetings, needing an injury-time goal to close out a 2-0 win in 2012 and saving a penalty in a win by the same score last year - both in World Cup qualifying. This match was similar, and Malta nearly went ahead when Clayton Failla shot wide in the 15th. That threat seemed to wake up the Azzurri, though, and Pelle and Giorgio Chiellini hit the crossbar and goal frame seconds apart in the 18th. Then came Pelle's goal. The 29-year-old also has five goals in eight matches for Southampton this season and, at 6 ft 4 in gives Conte a physical presence inside the area. Last season, Pelle scored 23 goals in 28 matches for Feyenoord in the Dutch league but was ignored by then-Italy coach Cesare Prandelli, who resigned after the Azzurri's first-round elimination from the World Cup in Brazil. Antonio Candreva and substitute Sebastian Giovinco hit the goal frame in the second half. The Azzurri sorely missed midfield maestro Andrea Pirlo, who was rested. Malta are managed by Pietro Ghedin, an Italian who was formerly an assistant coach with Italy.

"Robin van Persie has reason to be thankful. If Manchester United had not spent more than £150m on new firepower during the summer, he'd be getting slaughtered for his performances right now. The Dutchman has largely managed to stay under the radar in the opening two months of the campaign despite a series of anonymous, lacklustre displays that perhaps signal the start of a terminal decline. Inevitably the scrutiny has been on the likes of Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Ander Herrera, the latest batch of expensive acquisitions, rather than those who were already at Old Trafford. VIDEO Scroll down to see Louis van Gaal express his disappointment after West Brom draw . Robin van Persie turned in one of his worst performances in a Man United shirt in the 2-2 draw at West Brom . The Dutchman was ineffective all night and had just one shot on target during his 90 minutes on the pitch . Louis van Gaal is still searching for a winning formula at United, who sit sixth in the table after eight matches . But the focus is slowly shifting. Van Persie barely turned up in United's 2-2 draw at West Bromwich on Monday night and fans and pundits alike are starting to notice. Deployed as the spearhead of United's attack at The Hawthorns in the absence of the suspended Wayne Rooney and the jet-lagged Radamel Falcao, a sluggish Van Persie took 75 minutes to make an eye-catching contribution. With instinctive control on the periphery of the box, he unleashed a volley that smacked the base of the post, coming within millimetres of a United equaliser. It was the one glimpse of his best all night. In the end, it required Van Persie's compatriot Daley Blind to rescue the team late on and keep the gap to Premier League leaders Chelsea down to a mere 10 points. For the rest of the match, Van Persie was a shadow of his former self. Absent-minded and ineffective, he roamed around without ever looking like scoring. It required a goal from Daley Blind three minutes from the end to rescue United at The Hawthorns . Van Persie, who captained United, celebrates with Marouane Fellaini after the Belgian's second-half goal . United looked better once Radamel Falcao was introduced during the second half . Goals up to October 21st for club and country . 2012-2013 . 8 for Man United, 2 for Holland . Final season total: 35 . 2013-2014 . 7 for Man United, 6 for Holland . Final season total: 28 . 2014-2015 . 2 for Man United, 1 for Holland . It was a final indignity when Falcao, who had arrived back at Carrington two days later than Van Persie having clocked up several thousand more air miles, looked sharper than the Dutchman when he came on. Sky Sports pundit and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher tweeted that Van Persie, 31, has not been himself for 12 months now and had a point. On this form, Van Persie, who has just two goals for United so far this season, will lose his place leading United's line when Rooney returns and Falcao fully recovers. Comparing this point in time over the last couple of seasons and we see the beginnings of decline. Two years ago to the day, Van Persie scored in a 4-2 home win over Stoke City. It was his eighth goal in a United shirt since joining Sir Alex Ferguson's side from Arsenal. At this stage last season, he already had seven for United and a further six for his country. This season's return so far has been meagre by comparison and Van Persie is injury-free. Sky Sports pundit and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher summed up the thoughts of many fans . Van Persie prepares to re-start the game after one of West Brom's goals at The Hawthorns . Van Persie celebrates his goal against West Ham, one of two he has scored for United this season . Van Persie's heat map from Monday's  match shows most of his touches came too deep to make an impact . Passes: 24 . Passing accuracy: 79.2% . Duels won: 2 . Duels lost: 2 . Shots on target: 1 . Shots off target: 2 . Chances created: 1 . And his all-round influence is fading too. Against West Brom, Van Persie made just 24 passes, had just one shot on target and set-up just one chance for someone else. In all, United had 22 shots on the Baggies goal. His heat map from the evening shows his principal contributions came on the halfway line rather than in the penalty box. It was a shock to discover that he covered 10.93km during the game, second only to Blind and Luke Shaw. It seems most of that running was into the wrong areas. And it is certainly not the first time this season he has looked invisible in games and it was made worse by the fact he was captain for the night. When it was announced that Van Gaal was to succeed David Moyes at Old Trafford before the World Cup, the link-up with Van Persie seemed a match made in heaven. RVP had been heart-broken when Ferguson decided to retire in 2013 but this was going to make up for it. Van Gaal had taken the player under his wing long ago - his captain for the national team, they enjoyed an almost father-son bond and even went on scouting trips together. Just look at the joy on Van Gaal's face as Van Persie raced towards him for a high-five following that sensational diving header against Spain at the World Cup, the trigger for a 5-1 rout. Van Persie scored for Holland against Spain at the World Cup with a sensational diving header . And the striker rushed straight to Louis van Gaal for a high-five after scoring . Van Persie's free-scoring exploits for United appear to be on the wane . The Dutch striker was bitterly disappointed when Sir Alex Ferguson decided to retire in 2013 . Those scenes were going to be repeated every week on the Old Trafford touchline. Perhaps the pressures of a long run in the World Cup are still affecting Van Persie - though he had a very long rest afterwards - or perhaps there is another niggle affecting those ageing legs. Maybe he is still reeling from being second choice to Rooney last season under Moyes, or from Van Gaal's decision to give the captain's armband to his strike partner. The arrival of Falcao has maybe knocked his nose out of joint. Whatever the reason or reasons, Van Persie needs to show an urgent improvement in his game. United have a difficult run of fixtures now in which they play Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal in their next four matches. Van Gaal still believes United can make up the 10-point gap to leaders Chelsea and win the title. To have a sniff of a chance, he needs his favourite son to start performing straight away.","Robin van Persie was anonymous in United's 2-2 draw at West Brom .

"A French city has been made to scrap plans to force homeless people to wear yellow triangle ID tags after they were compared to Nazi-era Star of David badges. Authorities in Marseille wanted beggars to wear the badges, which would have carried information such as their personal details and any health issues, so they could be easily identifiable. But the proposals provoked outrage across France from human rights groups and even government ministers with some comparing the badges to the Star of David Jews were forced to sew on to their clothes during the Nazi era. Homeless man Arnaud shows off one of the yellow triangle ID badges authorities in Marseille were going to make beggars wear . The six-pointed yellow star was forced upon the Jews by Nazis in the Reich to wear to mark them out. French group La Ligue des droits de l'Homme said they were troubled by the badge and its resemblance to the yellow star that had to be worn by Jews. While social affairs minister Marisol Touraine told Le Parisien newspaper: 'Forcing homeless people to carry a yellow triangle indicating the illnesses they might have is outrageous. You don't point the finger at the poorest. The plan provoked outrage with human rights groups and even government ministers comparing the ID tags to the Star of David badges Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany . Earlier this week demonstrators gathered outside the City Hall of Marseille to protest against the plans, which were eventually dropped today . The ID tags for homeless people were compared to the yellow Star of David badges worn by Jews in Nazi Germany, pictured . 'You don't write their illnesses on their clothes. Medical confidentiality, in particular, is a fundamental right. I want this local initiative to be stopped.' Demonstrators also gathered outside the City Hall of Marseille to protest against the badges which they said were discriminatory. They held up signs and placards with one reading '1933-1945 Never Again', with the yellow triangle and Star of David emblem next to it. Council officials had tried to defend the plan saying they were only to help emergency services if they have to come to the aid of a homeless person. Over 100 of the cards had also been distributed around the city. But today, council of France's second largest city, bowed down to pressure and announced that they would be scrapping the plan. The head of the social and medical emergency services SAMU Sociale René Giancarli told The Local: 'It’s finished. There won’t be any more cards.'","Officials in Marseille wanted homeless people to wear triangle ID tags .

"To her family, Amira Karroum was a carefree girl from the Gold Coast who went dancing in night clubs and hung out with her friends. But after moving to Sydney's west in 2011, she and her sister, Rose, became devout Muslims and donned hijabs. Her father - a restaurant owner on Queensland's Gold Coast - described his daughter, who went to an Anglican private school and came from a wealthy family, as 'beautiful'. Scroll down for video . Amira Karroum, left,  was educated at an Anglican private school and in 2011, after moving to Sydney with her sister, became a devout Muslim, donning a hijab, right . Her father, Mohammed Karroum, said his daughter was 'beautiful', and liked barbecues and clubbing . Mohammed Karroum said she and her friends would enjoy barbecues at their waterfront home where she would swim and dance. 'She goes to the nightclub with her sister, just having a good time like any ordinary girl,' he told ABC's 7.30. In 2013, she married Islamic extremist Tyler Perry who was a seasoned jihadist from Brisbane, Queensland and had converted to the religion during his time in the U.S. as a teenager. His mother took him to Colorado after the then-13-year-old's behaviour started getting out of control. It was there he discovered Islam under the teachings of senior al-Qaeda figure Anwar al Awlaki. Perry's half-brother Josiah Turnbull told the 7.30 Report his rebellious brother came back a changed man after his stint in the U.S. and kept out of trouble. In the following years, Mr Turnbull said his half-brother travelled overseas a lot under the pretense he was carrying out missionary work. Ms Karroum had gone to Syria to join Perry (pictured) and died side-by-side with him in the Middle East . Mr Karroum was devastated when he found out his daughter had been killed in Syria . Perry's half-brother Josiah Turnbull said the jihadist came back a changed man after his visit to the U.S. Mr Turnbull said he was not sure what Perry was doing but he could have been taking part in military training camps for al-Qaeda. It was in Sydney the paths of Ms Karroum and Perry crossed. At the time, he was part of Street Dawah - a group looking to convert Australians to the Islamic faith and was led by Mohammad Ali Baryalei. It was through the group that he met Ms Karroum's cousins Bilal Sayadi and Fadl Sayadi. Fadl was one of the men arrested as part of Australian terror plot Operation Pendennis along with Australian jihadist Khaled Sharrouf. In April 2013, the couple were married but their union came as a shock to both their families, particularly to Ms Karroum's father Mohammed who initially refused to sanction the marriage. 'Then my cousin came to me and he started talking to me: ""He's [Perry] alright, he's beautiful person"",' Mr Karroum said. 'And they got married there and then - that day.' But this union would be short lived as Perry and his new bride had plans to join Ali Baryalei in Syria, with authorities believing the Kings Cross security guard has now risen to a senior position of terror group and al-Qaeda off-shoot Islamic State. Perry made the move to the Middle East first before his bride followed earlier this year after a failed attempt to flee the country in December last year. Mohammad Ali Baryalei was the leader of Street Dawah - a group dedicated to converting Australians to Islam - and Perry and Ms Karroum were planning to join him in Syria . Before she left, Ms Karroum made one last visit to her father - who owned a Gold Coast restaurant - in Queensland. Mr Karroum said he had sensed something was wrong. 'She came and saw me before she left, I didn't know she was leaving, and she hugged me and she started to cry,' he said. 'I said to her, ""What's wrong?"", she said to me, ""Nothing, I just love you Dad"". 'And I accepted it - I didn't know she was saying goodbye.' When Ms Karroum arrived in Syria to join her husband, a bloody conflict was playing out in the city of Aleppo between ISIS - which is now known as Islamic State - and another extremist group, Jabhat Al Nusra. It was here she and Perry would spend their final days before they were executed in a home they shared with another couple during a Jabhat Al Nusra ambush. 'She sent me a message: ""Please Dad, pray to Allah and ask him to forgive you for the days, for the years you have not prayed for him, death is around the corner Dad. I love you"",' an emotional Mohammed Karroum recalled. Two days after his daughter arrived in the Middle East, she was killed by a spray of bullets and her body dismembered. 'I love her so much...I missed everything about her. She’s gone forever,' Mr Karroum said.","Amira Karroum married Australian-American jihadist Tyler Perry in 2013 .

"Billionaire businessman James Stunt's £1million calvalcade of cars has been spotted for a second time this week, parked outside another prestigious art gallery in the capital. The 28-year-old, who is married to Petra - the daughter of Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone - was yesterday seen picking up an array of art work at Christie's Art Gallery in London's Old Brompton Road. But it seems Mr Stunt's vast wealth and fortune does not make him exempt from the eagle eye of parking attendants. A traffic warden patrolling the exclusive South Kensington streets close to the prestigious art house, was not intimidated by the five-strong cavalry of Rolls Royce, Range Rovers and a Lamborghini. Billionaire James Stunt and his cavalcade of super cars was spotted out in London again this week, yesterday parked in Old Brompton Road in South Kensington . The 28-year-old, who is married to Petra, the daughter of Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone, parked his Lamborghini super car and fleet of Rolls Royces and Range Rovers, outside Christie's Art Gallery . Mr Stunt's vast wealth and fortune did not intimidate a conscientious traffic warden patrolling the area . The warden appeared to take down the details of the fleet of cars before a note resembling a parking ticket was placed on the windscreen of Mr Stunt's £350,000 Lamborghini . The art collector (left) was spotted instructing his security team to load various works of art into his waiting convoy of cars (right) The conscientious warden did not hesitate in the face of the imposing brigade of cars and security staff, appearing to treat Mr Stunt as any other motorist on his patch. He appeared to take down the fleet's details before a piece of paper resembling a parking ticket was placed on the front window of the Lamborghini super car, which is worth £350,000 and was driven away from the gallery by Mr Stunt himself. Mr Stunt was accompanied by his team of security staff, as he appeared to be adding to his already extensive art collection. Members of his team were spotted carrying paintings from the art gallery, loading them into the waiting fleet of super cars. Just four days earlier, Mr Stunt was spotted in almost identical circumstances, as his convoy pulled up at the Daniel Hunt Fine Art Gallery on Sloane Street in neighbouring Chelsea. Mr Stunt is well known for his art collection, and recently he attempted to purchase a self-portrait by Baroque painter Anthony Van Dyck for his Los Angeles home. But the sale of the painting fell through when art campaigners mounted opposition to the work being shipped out of the UK. The successful campaign raised more than £10million to save the portrait for the nation, and the work, which dates back to 1640, has been offered to the National Portrait Gallery after Mr Stunt agreed to withdraw. Watched by Mr Stunt's security team, the traffic warden goes about his day's work, refusing to treat the billionaire any differently to other motorists on his patch .

He was proud to tell me it's the only one in the world, there isn't another one. 'It's beautiful, but I said: ""What do you want this car for in London?"" He said it's very comfortable. But I said: ""For Christ's sake! Where are you going in it?"" ' ‘James has . got another car following him with so-called bodyguards, but nobody’s . going to kill him,’ 83-year-old Mr Ecclestone added. ‘I told him: “If any one wanted to kill you, which they don’t, those guys that are driving in that car ain’t going to help.” ‘I think he got this from America.

"With only hours left to live, cancer patient and right-to-die activist Brittany Maynard took the time to reach out to a stranger whom she had come to view as a kindred spirit. Maynard, the 29-year-old newlywed suffering from terminal brain cancer who has emerged as the face of the death-with-dignity movement, passed away peacefully at her Portland, Oregon, home November 1 after taking a lethal drug. In the hours before she ended her life, Maynard sent an email to Barbara Mancini, a former nurse from Philadelphia, who had written to her in late October to express her support for her controversial decision. Scroll down for videos . Kindred spirits: Terminally ill Brittany Maynard (left) penned a note to Barbara Mancini (right) encouraging her to continue the fight for the right to die with dignity . Poster girl: Maynard, 29, has become the face of the death-with-dignity movement after going public with her decision to end her life on her own terms . ‘In the note, I told her I admired what she was doing. I felt it was selfless and courageous,’ Mancini told ABC News Thursday. ‘I never expected she would respond because it was late October and I knew she was having daily seizures and she was getting worse all the time.’ Maynard and Mancini never met in person, but the 29-year-old woman knew of her story, which made national headlines last year. Barbara Mancini, a 58-year-old married mother of two, was arrested in 2013 for giving her terminally ill 93-year-old father a lethal dose of morphine to end his suffering. Letter from a stranger: In October, Mancini sent Maynard an email expressing her support for her. Pictured here is Brittany with her husband on their wedding day . Loving family: Maynard's decision to end her suffering was supported by her newlywed husband, Dan Diaz, (left) and her mother, Debbie Ziegler (right) After a drawn-out and costly legal battle that saw Mancini suspended from her job, she was cleared of all charges this past February, but her brush with the law over assisted suicide has left an indelible impression on her. In her email written shortly before drawing her last breath, Maynard wrote to Manicni telling her she was familiar with her ordeal and encouraging her to continue fighting for the right to die with dignity. 'I am so sorry you had to endure that,' she wrote, according to People Magazine. 'It was clear to me, in my heart, that you were doing your very best to care for your terminally ailing father. 'That is a difficult job. As a terminally ill person myself, I understand what the level of sacrifice means for a loving and supportive family on an emotional, physical and financial level. Harrowing tale: Barbara Mancini was arrested last year for giving her dying 93-year-old father (right) morphine . Exonerated: In February, the registered nurse, pictured here with her late father, was cleared of assisted suicide charges . Mancini's supporters said the state of Pennsylvania was imposing itself in Joseph Yourshaw's desire to end his own life after suffering numerous health complications . ‘Stories like yours and mine put human faces on a controversial topic that many politicians are happy to sweep under the rug,’ Maynard wrote. ‘I wish I could have had the pleasure of meeting you in person.’ Mrs Manicni said she was 'deeply touched' by the dying woman's last note and vowed to carry on her legacy. ‘I truly believe it's the right thing to allow dying people who are mentally competent have a choice in how their life ends,’ she said. Late last month, Mancini quit her job as a nurse to become a spokesperson for Compassion & Choices advocating for more death with dignity laws. Brittany Maynard went public with her decision to end her life to raise funds through the organization Compassion & Choices to advocate for assisted suicide as an option for terminally ill patients. She was featured on the cover of People magazine last month. Gracious: With just hours left to live, Maynard, pictured here with her mother, wrote to Mancini telling her she was familiar with her story and encouraging her to continue advocating for the right to die . Rest in peace: Maynard, a brain cancer victim, passed away November 1 after taking a lethal medication . Maynard was diagnosed in January with a glioblastoma brain tumor and moved from her San Francisco Bay Area home to Oregon, one of five states that allow assisted suicides for terminally ill patients. 'Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me … but would have taken so much more. The world is a beautiful place, travel has been my greatest teacher, my close friends and folks are the greatest givers. I even have a ring of support around my bed as I type … . Goodbye world. Spread good energy. Pay it forward!' Since 1997, more than 750 patients in Oregon have died from ingesting medications prescribed under the state's death with dignity law, according to the Oregon Public Health Division. Barbara Mancini, then 57 years old, was charged in the summer of 2013 with giving a nearly full one-ounce bottle of morphine to her father, Joseph Yourshaw, at his Pottsville home in February 2013 for the purpose of helping him end his life. Yourshaw died at a hospital four days later after a hospice nurse called 911. The 93-year-old man had a Do Not Resuscitate order and had made it clear he wanted to die after enduring excrutiating pain for two weeks. In February, a Pennsylvania judge exonerated Mancini after ruling that the state Attorney General's Office failed to prove that the woman had committed a crime.

"Croatia’s government has received a controversial proposal  that says a secluded, barren island of rock known as the Naked Island would be the perfect place to put gay tourists. Goli Otok was used as a penal colony in Communist times and the pitch to transform it into a gay tourism hub is based on its isolated location in the northern Adriatic Sea. The proposal from an independent think tank says the island – miles away from anywhere – would be the perfect spot for gay tourists because it would give them privacy away from others. Barren island of rock: A proposal says isolated Goli Otok would be the perfect place for gay tourists . Former political prison: The island in the northern Adriatic Sea was used as a penal colony by the Communists . Still home to a handful of derelict buildings, the uninhabited island was used by the Communists as a political prison when Croatia was part of Yugoslavia. It housed thousands of prisoners who lived in cramped conditions and were forced into labour and tortured by their captors for opposing communism. Hundreds died before the prison was disbanded. The proposal to turn Goli Otok into a gay tourism destination was put forward by the Association of Eco and Social Forum of Croatia after Croatia's government solicited potential investment opportunities. Aljosa Babic, the head of the association, said it would be a welcome way to boost tourism in the region and it would be easy to implement because Goli Otok is property of the Republic of Croatia. He added cryptically: ‘Because of its past the island could be an attractive destination.’ In response to questions about whether the proposal is homophobic, a spokesman for Zagreb Pride condemned the idea, telling MailOnline Travel: ‘The investor is a local politician from Rijeka that run for public office in many years, but never got elected. We don’t consider his proposal as relevant.’ Abandoned: The prison was disbanded in the late 1980s but several derelict buildings are still standing . Prison of horrors: Political prisoners were forced into labour and tortured on Goli Otok . Mr Babic, who handed the recommendation to tourism minister Darko Lorencin, said the fact that the 1.5-square mile island is not being used is a waste of resources. In the document prepared for the tourism ministry the association said that the big advantage of the island was that it was so secluded and had so little to recommend it that not even locals bothered to go there - and that meant it was private. They wrote: ‘Gay guests could enjoy their time at the island for 24 hours per day without anyone bothering them. It is completely private.’ Croatia places 44th on a list of destinations for gay tourists. According to the European Gay Tourist Association, gay tourists spend up to £50m on holidays, said Mr Babic.

"A New Zealand man who was paid 'shopping money' to smuggle Ice into Bali may now have to pay the ultimate price after being arrested by Indonesian authorities. Anthony Glen de Malmanche is facing the death penalty after allegedly smuggling 1.7kg of crystal methamphetamine into the popular holiday destination. Scroll down for video . Antony Glen De Malmanche sits silently as evidence is placed next to him by customs security . The investigation turned up limited information about the drug smuggling plan, but it appears De Malmanche was not going to make a killing out of the crime. 'It was controlled from the outside. He hasn't said how much he's paid. He only admitted to be given shopping money,' Joni Lai, the deputy of Bali Provincial Police Drugs Squad, said.

De Malmanche had initially travelled to Hong Kong to see a woman he'd met online. From here he flew into Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport from Hong Kong with a suspicious-looking package. The 52-year-old was due to meet the woman in Bali where they were planning to get married, according to media reports. However, customs officers at the airport were alerted after De Malmanche began acting suspiciously while collecting his luggage on Monday morning. Photographers clamour to get a picture of the bag of Ice and De Malmanche . De Malmanche is escorted from the press conference by customs officers . 'From X-ray examination, we found something suspicious in his green backpack,' the airport's head of customs office Budi Harjanto told reporters in Bali on Friday.

A narcotics test found the crystal was methamphetamine, he said. If found guilty De Malmanche could end up facing the death penalty . De Malmanche was charged under a section of Indonesia's narcotics law that carries a maximum penalty of death and a one billion rupiah ($A97,037) fine.

"A couple who got divorced after 21 years of marriage are celebrating their first wedding anniversary - for the second time. Tomorrow is a year since Neville and Barbara Pearce were married again after 35 years apart. Barbara, 79, and Neville, 81, met in 1953, and were married three years later, but then divorced in 1977. But after the death of Neville's second wife, who was also called Barbara, in 2012, the pair found love again. Neville and Barbara Pearce remarried after 35 years apart. Pictured left, their first wedding day in 1956 and right, their second wedding in December last year . They first met at a dance hall when Barbara was 18 and they enjoyed courting at the local cinema. In 1954, Neville fractured his spine whilst working on a roof as a painter and decorator and couldn't work for three years. Barbara walked with him up and down different streets to get him fit again. They first got married at St Mary's Church, Barnsley on July 7, 1956, and had two children, David and Susan. But work and family pressures drove them apart. 'We were young and didn't put enough into it. It wasn't acrimonious, or we wouldn't be married today, there was no reason not to be friends,' said Neville. 'You only get out what you put in, but it's all water under the bridge.' The pair rekindled their relationship after the death of Neville's second wife, also called Barbara, in 2012 . After his second wife died, Neville asked Barbara out for a meal and they rekindled their relationship. They spent more time together after Barbara broke her hip and enjoyed a holiday in Scotland before Neville got down on one knee and popped the question for a second time. Barbara said: 'I didn't say yes straight away, I said I had to think about it. But I thought it was right. We have wasted time not being together.' 'I don't think we've ever stopped loving each other. Our family told us to get on with it, they are really pleased for us,' added Neville. The couple, who live in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, married for the second time at nearby St Thomas' Church in Gawber. And Barbara said the time apart has made for a better marriage. Barbara says they get along better now and Neville adds: 'I don't think we ever stopped loving each other' She said: 'It's more simple now. We've realised as we've both got older that we would do things differently. 'We get along and don't argue. There are not the same strains as before.' Recalling her second wedding day, she added: 'It was a really lovely day. I'd not seen much of Neville's family because they live away. 'But his sister stood up at the reception and said she had got her family back.' After their nuptials and a reception, they spent Christmas in Northumberland with their family. The couple are now looking forward to celebrating the first wedding anniversary a second time around with a bottle of beer and a pork pie.","Neville and Barbara Pearce first met in 1953 and married three years later .

"Holidaymakers who are planning to fly a camera-equipped drone in Paris’ tourist zones risk spending time in jail and being slapped with a hefty fine. An Israeli tourist found out the hard way this week when he was arrested in front of Notre Dame Cathedral while flying a drone above some of Paris’ top attractions. In what has become a growing problem for authorities in Paris and other tourist hotspots, the 24-year-old man spent a night behind bars and was hit with a £310 fine before he was released. Scroll down for video . Grounded: A 24-year-old holidaymaker spent a night in jail after he was arrested for flying a drone in Paris . A police source told Agence France-Presse that the man launched the drone, equipped with a GoPro camera, above the famous Gothic church on Wednesday morning and sent it hovering over the historic Hotel-Dieu hospital and a police station. Police located the man after they spotted the drone on a surveillance camera. When officers arrived at the church square, the tourist told them he was not aware flying a drone in Paris is illegal and he was filming the locations for ‘private purposes’. He’s the latest tourist to be grounded by France’s tough laws around the devices, which are becoming more common among tourists and professional and amateur videographers. In February, police arrested a member of the French Foreign Legion for using his drone around the Eiffel Tower. That same month, police in Nancy charged a teenager who used his drone to film historic sites. A buzz in the air: Drones are growing in popularity among tourists and professional and amateur videographers . Tourists in the US have also landed themselves in trouble for using drones to capture video of amazing landscapes. Donald Criswell of Molalla, Oregon, was fined £625 on Thursday for violating a ban on unmanned aircraft in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. His drone buzzed bison and startled tourists gathered at a popular geyser basin, according to a park spokesman. Hefty fine: A tourist was prosecuted after buzzing bison and startling tourists in Yellowstone National Park . It was the third prosecution in as many weeks of visitors who used the devices despite signs warning of the prohibition. A Dutch tourist last month pleaded guilty to the violation and was ordered to pay penalties of more than £1,800 for crashing a drone into Yellowstone's largest and arguably most famous hot spring in August. Also last month, a visitor from Germany was banned from the park for a year and sentenced to a year of unsupervised probation after admitting to flying a drone in July that crashed into Yellowstone Lake.

"Lionel Messi celebrated the win that moved Barcelona to within one point of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga by saying he would not leave the club for the Premier League. Messi said after the 3-1 win over Atletico Madrid: 'I have not laid down any conditions for me to stay at this club and neither do I have any intention of leaving. I have heard stories about my father already having spoken to Chelsea and Manchester City but it is not true.' Messi mysteriously started following Chelsea on Instagram last Monday - the day he failed to turn up for training complaining of a stomach bug.

"This is the moment a missile fired by an RAF Tornado destroyed an ISIS vehicle in north-west Iraq. The footage, released by the Ministry of Defence, shows the jihadists' vehicle engulfed in a ball of flame after the 110lb bomb slams into it. The vehicle, located in Al Qaim, close to the border with Syria, appears to be a Humvee, an American-built military vehicle that were supplied to Iraqi forces. Scroll down for video . Target: The ISIS vehicle moments before it was destroyed by a missile launched from an RAF Tornado . Strike: The missile hits the vehicle in Al Qaim, close to the border with Syria . Smoke billows from the destroyed vehicle after the Brimstone missile attack . A video shows the remains. Two RAF Tornadoes were investigating ISIS activity following an earlier attack . Many have been captured by ISIS - which also goes by the name Islamic State and another acronym, ISIL - raids on depots and bases. A statement from the ministry said: 'Two Royal Air Force Tornado GR4s were tasked to investigate ISIL activity near the scene of an earlier successful coalition air strike at Al Qaim, north-west of Baghdad. 'The aircraft, as part of the international coalition supporting the Iraqi government, identified and destroyed an ISIL armed vehicle using a single Brimstone missile.' Meanwhile Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighters and moderate Syrian rebels bombarded Islamic State positions in the besieged border town of Kobane, but it was unclear if the arrival of the Iraqi reinforcements would turn the tide in the battle for the besieged Syrian border town. Kobane has become a symbolic test of the U.S.-led coalition's ability to halt the advance of ISIS, which has poured weapons and fighters into its assault of the town that has lasted more than a month. The battle has deflected attention from significant gains elsewhere in Syria by Islamic State, which has seized two gas fields within a week from President Bashar al-Assad's forces in the centre of the country. In Iraq, the group executed more than 300 members of a Sunni tribe that dared oppose it last week, after seizing the tribe's village in the Euphrates valley west of Baghdad. On Monday, a member of the tribe said another 36 members had been executed in the provincial capital Anbar. The eyes of the world have been on Kobane, where weeks of fighting have taken place within full view of the Turkish border, causing outrage among Kurds in Turkey who blame their government for doing too little to help defend the town. The arrival in Kobane of the Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga and additional Syrian Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters in recent days has escalated efforts to defend the town after weeks of U.S.-led air strikes slowed but did not reverse the Islamists' advance. White smoke billowed into the sky as peshmerga and FSA fighters appeared to combine forces, raining cannon and mortar fire down on Islamic State positions to the west of the city, a Reuters witness said. On a mission: RAF jets in Iraq, where the warplanes are engaged in a bombing campaign against ISIS targets . How the trio of Brimstone missiles usually look when they are freshly loaded onto a Tornado warplane . The U.S. military said it bombed Islamic State positions in Syria five times and in Iraq nine times on Sunday and Monday, including near Kobane. An estimated 150 Iraqi Kurdish fighters crossed into Kobane with arms and ammunition from Turkey late on Friday, the first time Ankara has allowed reinforcements to reach the town. '(Their) heavy weapons have been a key reinforcement for us. At the moment they're mostly fighting on the western front, there's also FSA there too,' said Meryem Kobane, a commander with the YPG, the main Syrian Kurdish armed group in Kobane. She said fierce fighting was also continuing in eastern and southern parts of the city. Off to war: Kurdish peshmerga fighters  gesture atop a military vehicle armed with a heavy infantry weapon as they ride towards the Syrian town of Kobane, also known as Ain al-Arab, from Turkey . An estimated 150 Iraqi Kurdish fighters crossed into Kobane with arms and ammunition from Turkey late on Friday, the first time Ankara has allowed reinforcements to reach the town . The peshmerga, the official security forces of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region, have deployed behind Syrian Kurdish forces and are supporting them with artillery and mortar fire, according to Ersin Caksu, a journalist inside Kobane. The fiercest fighting was taking place in the south and east, areas where the reinforcements were not deployed, he said. Despite weeks of air strikes, Islamic State has continued to inflict heavy losses on Kobane's defenders. Late last week hospital sources in Turkey reported a jump in the number of dead and wounded Kurdish fighters being brought across the frontier. In Iraq, Islamic State fighters have stormed through mainly Sunni Muslim cities and towns in the Tigris and Euphrates valleys north and west of Baghdad, in part with the support of many Sunni Muslims angry at perceived mistreatment by the Shi'ite-led government in Baghdad. Smoke rises from the Syrian border town of Kobane. Islamic State militants fired mortar shells against Kurdish fighters, who have been holding off for nearly seven weeks an ISIS offensive . Washington hopes that Sunni tribes can be lured to switch sides, as they did during the U.S. 'surge' campaign against al Qaeda in 2006-2007. But so far, Sunni tribes that have dared to stand up to Islamic State have suffered brutal fates, while complaining of little support from the Baghdad government. More than 320 members of the Albu Nimr tribe, including women and children, have been hunted down, captured, shot and buried in mass graves since their village fell to the fighters. The self-designated Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, known by the acronym ISIS, is also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and, since declaring its 'caliphate' across a swathe of the Middle East, simply Islamic State. In Arabic, the group is known by an acronym that transliterates to 'Da'esh' or 'Dash'.","Ministry of Defence footage shows Tornado attack on militant truck .

Across the country crowds gathered to ring bells, sound sirens and blast vuvuzelas before observing several minutes silence in a touching tribute to his 67 years in public service. It was a time to remember his struggle against white-minority rule and also to reflect upon the country's failure to capitalise on the freedom he fought for. Veterans of the anti-apartheid struggle lay wreaths at the foot of a statue of Mr Mandela in Pretoria and crowds sang 'Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika' (God Bless Africa), the adopted national anthem.

'One year ago the world lost a leader whose struggle and sacrifices inspired us to stand up for our fundamental principles, whose example reminded us of the enduring need for compassion, understanding, and reconciliation, and whose vision saw the promise of a better world,' Mr Obama said. 'As we pause today to remember the legacy of Madiba, I hope we can all take a moment to reflect on how Mandela's life has inspired our own, and will impact the paths of generations to come - including the next generation of world leaders, as while Mandela left behind a world more just and free, there is much more work to be done.

'That's just the spirit of who granddad was, that even after a year that he's gone peace still prevails, people still upholding his legacy and what he stood for, because he stood for peace and reconciliation,' she said. The anniversary has also given people the chance to reflect on the disappointing pace of change since 1994 and vent frustration at President JacobZuma and his ruling African National Congress (ANC) party.

"Islamic State militants are using huge numbers of U.S.-made bullets to maim and kill innocent victims across Iraq and Syria, a new survey has revealed. A study of more than 1,700 shells fired by ISIS in the Kurdish regions of the two countries found that 20 per cent were manufactured in America. Only ammunition from the former Soviet Union and China were found in greater numbers in a list of 21 countries ranging from Serbia and Romania to North Korea and Sudan. Mark of origin: A survey of ammunition fired by jihadists in Iraq and Syria shows huge numbers of bullets were made in the U.S, including these four rifle cartridges which were manufactured at the U.S.-government owned Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 . In the case of the United States, much of the ammunition was likely seized when the jihadists sent Iraqi forces fleeing during its lightning uprising  in June. The report found that many of the 323 U.S.-made cartridges were manufactured between 2000 and 2010 - a period when America was arming the Iraqi army following the second Gulf War. Conflict Armament Research (CAR), which conducted the study, noted in its report: 'IS forces appear to have acquired a large part of their current arsenal from stocks seized from, or abandoned by, Iraqi defence and security forces. 'The U.S. gifted much of this materiel to Iraq.' Analysis of the markings on the bottom of the shells found that many had been made at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Missouri. The shells comprised mainly 5.56 x 45mm cartridges which are used in U.S.-supplied M16 and M4 assault rifles, the report said. Falling into the wrong hands: A study of more than 1,700 shells fired by ISIS fighters (above, file picture) in the Kurdish regions of Syria and Iraq found that 20 per cent were manufactured in America . The spent shell casings were collected between July 22 and August 15 by a private arms-tracing group in four Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria. One of those included the Sinjar Mountains where up to 200,000 Yazidis to flee after the terror group stormed the surrounding villages and captured women to be sold as sex slaves. The wide range of countries which supplied the bullets indicates just how nebulous the situation is on the ground in the Middle East, with different factions obtaining weaponry by various means and sources. CAR, a non-profit research organisation funded by the European Union report, said: 'The sample includes ammunition manufactured in 21 countries during a period of nearly 70 years (1945–2014). 'The variety and age of ammunition used by IS forces indicates a large array of ammunition supply sources, which is attributable to the group having captured materiel during numerous engagements and against various opponents, across Iraq and Syria.' Bullets from the Russian federation were much newer - as recent as seven months - suggesting they had been obtained from Syrian forces, the study said. China 445 . Soviet Union 338 .

"Judging by these pictures he's none too happy about it, but Britain's fattest cat now has his own personal trainer. Ulric, who weighs 2st 2lbs, is getting back into shape with the help of a puppy. The Norwegian Forest cat - who at a staggering 2st 2lbs is twice the weight of a normal feline - has been on a diet since last year but barely lost a pound. Scroll down for video . Desperate owner Jan Mitchell (pictured with Ulric) had bought the puppy to chase Ulric the overweight Norwegian Forest cat around the garden to help shift some weight . Now his desperate owner Jan Mitchell has bought a five-month old puppy to help him flight the flab. Dennis, a pugalier (a pug crossed with a King Charles cavalier spaniel) has got Ulric running and play fighting in a bid to fight the flab after dieting failed. And in three months of forced exercise, the tubby tomcat has already lost 2lbs - more than he lost in 16 months of dieting. Jan, 69, from Dorchester, Dorset, said:  'We wanted to get a puppy in the hope he would play with Ulric but Dennis has turned out to be a bit of a personal trainer for him. 'They get on really well and Ulric now runs around the garden, which he never went in before. Although, he doesn't really have much choice when Dennis is chasing him. Five month old pug-cross Dennis is helping to get Britain's fattest cat into shape as they play together in the garden of their Dorset home . The new doggy trainer seems to be doing the trick as in three months of forced exercise, Ulric has already lost 2lbs - more than he lost in 16 months of dieting . 'They play fight and wrestle on the ground quite a lot which must be doing Ulric some good. Ulric is a lot more active than he's ever been and is starting to lose weight.' Ulric was a normal-size kitten when Jan got him and his sister Ulla at three months old, but his lazy nature and his habit of stealing his sister's food meant by 15 months old he was 1st 3lbs. When he hit two stone - more than twice the average weight of a healthy cat - Jan entered him in a pet slimming competition run by animal charity PDSA. Ulric was the heaviest cat ever to take part in the competition and had his food weighed to make sure he didn't overeat, but after the six-month competition he'd barely lost a pound. Jan, a retired secretary, said: 'We couldn't really work out why Ulric got so fat - his diet only consisted of dry cat food and water, nothing elaborate. The tubby tomcat had been declared as morbidly obese by vets when he ballooned to twice his normal weight after spending years stealing his sister Ulla's food . 'He just kept getting bigger and bigger and when he hit two stone that's when the alarm bells started ringing. 'He is a lovely cat but he's just very greedy and lazy. He didn't do any exercise and spent all day lying around. I tried putting him on a lead and take him for a walk but he refused to move. 'Dennis absolutely loves him and can't leave him alone. 'Ulric is still on a diet but now he is getting more exercise hopefully he should lose a lot more weight.' The seven-year-old Norwegian Forest cat was declared as morbidly obese by vets when he ballooned to twice his normal weight after he spent years stealing his sister Ulla's food and gorging on cat biscuits. He is only a few pounds off what is thought to be the world's heaviest cat, the aptly named Meatball from the US, who weighs in at a whopping two-and-a-half stone. The four-year-old puss was handed over to Maricopa County Animal Care and Control in Phoenix, Arizona, by his former owners. Previous fattest cat, Meow - also from the US - died at 2st 11lbin 2012.

Pampered: City officials shelled out more than $17,000 to prepare a pet care facility at a naval base for Bentley, where vets in hazmat suits checked up on him twice-daily . Pham's beloved dog, a King Charles spaniel, was quarantined for 21 days at secret Dallas navy base and monitored twice-daily by veterinarians in hazmat suits for signs of the deadly virus. The nurse and Bentley were privately reunited November 1 at a secret location. At a news conference held that day, Pham tearfully thanked for the thoughts and prayers for 'me and Mr Bentley,' whom she called 'one of my best friends.' Ms Pham was the first Ebola patient in the US to have been in contact with a pet as she came down with the virus. She requested that her pup be placed in quarantine instead of destroyed like a Spanish nurse's dog. City officials shelled out more than $17,000 to prepare the pet care facility for Bentley, which came equipped with a special cage to collect his excrement for testing and disposal. Another $1,000 was spent on supplies, and more than $2,000 on a generator and to cover labor costs. An additional $6,000 went towards clean-up expenses. Private reunion: Pham traveled to the naval base in November to retrieve Bentley from his isolation unit . Smiles: Pham posed excitedly with her 'best friend' Mr Bentley and one of the vets that cared for him . The cost of the pup's care will be offset by $19,000 in private donations and grants, the city said. 'It speaks to the character of Texans and our love of animals. It was not even an option to put down a dog that had not been tested for Ebola,' Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed told TH Online. The city's other Ebola-related expenses included hazardous material response, police and fire department overtime and bills for the care and security of Duncan's family, who were put under a mandatory quarantine that required relocation from the contaminated apartment Duncan had stayed at. Ebola free: Bentley, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel belonging to cured Ebola patient Nina Pham, was released from quarantine last month. Pictured above in a snap shared by Dallas Animal Services . Where's Nina? Pham had not been allowed to visit her dog as it could have caused Bentley to become anxious . Under observation: Workers in hazmat suits removed Bentley from Pham's home, and took him to a special isolation room at a nearby naval base. He has been treated by veterinarians and other workers every day . Hazmat response totaled nearly $60,000 in expenses, according to the report, and almost $19,000 went toward rehiring paramedics for a 21-day monitoring period. The invoice released by the city does not include expenses paid for by Dallas County, the state or federal agencies in response to the Ebola crisis. Meanwhile, the Texas Department of State Health Services says it incurred about $1.28million in costs.

"Robbie Keane has told the Republic of Ireland to forget the nightmares they have suffered at the hands of Germany in the recent past as they attempt to take the biggest of scalps. Ireland conceded nine goals, six of them on one horrific night the Aviva Stadium, and scored only once in reply during the last World Cup qualifying campaign, with the Germans running riot on their way to glory in Brazil. However, as he prepared to lock horns with Joachim Low's men once again in Euro 2016 qualifying battle in Gelsenkirchen on Tuesday evening, Keane insisted all that was history. Republic of Ireland captain Robbie Keane celebrates scoring against Gibraltar on Saturday during the 7-0 win . Keane scored a hat-trick to take his tally of international goals up to 65 for the Republic of Ireland . The 34-year-old Republic skipper said: 'To be honest with you, I don't think the players are thinking too much about what happened in the past. We have to concentrate on what we are doing now. 'We are certainly a different team than we were a few years ago. The players certainly haven't mentioned it this week, and they shouldn't be, to be honest with you. 'It's a completely different game, and we're going into this game on a good run and with a lot of confidence. 'These games, you have to go and enjoy it. You have seen the stadium here - it's absolutely fantastic. These are games that any player wants to be involved in. You are playing against one of the best teams in the world - go out and enjoy it. Keane, pictured leaving the Aviva Stadium pitch with the match ball, is confident ahead of facing Germany . 'As long as you know what your jobs are and stick to that, go out and give it a go because you are playing against the World Cup champions. 'We have players in this squad who are very, very comfortable in what they are doing at club level, and they and can bring it on to the international stage, there's no question. 'In the last two games, we have got some great results, so we are clearly confident that we can come here and get something out of the game.' The two sides will run out at the Veltins Stadium in contrasting moods, with Germany desperate to bounce back from a shock Group D defeat in Poland on Saturday a few hours after Ireland trounced Gibraltar 7-0 in Dublin to maintain a 100 per cent start to their campaign. Winger James McClean celebrates scoring the first of his two goals against Gibraltar at the Aviva stadium . Manager Martin O'Neill knows the respective challenges represented by the two opponents could hardly be more different, and, while the approach will undoubtedly change, he is hoping the basics will not. O'Neill said: 'I don't think Germany will allow us the same sort of space to play in. But we are obviously going to encounter many different problems during the game. The Germans are world champions and they have a habit of qualifying for competitions. 'We have our own plan. I can't turn around say, 'Stick to plans'. Best-laid plans can disappear after five minutes in a match. Germany's Thomas Muller (centre) appears dejected after Poland's first goal during their 2-0 defeat in Warsaw . 'We are going with some confidence into the game. If we are pressed back, then okay, but if we deliberately sit in, then Germany will eventually pick you off . 'We want to try to attack as well. It's a game to relish. It's one where we want to go out and do something about the game, not just let the game disappear.' Germany coach Low made a point of mentioning Ireland's fighting spirit during his own pre-match press conference, and O'Neill was not at all put out by it. He said: 'I understand that - he's got a fair amount of fight in own team too. I wouldn't decry those attributes - in fact, I am quite pleased that he would mention those. GERMANY (prob, 4-4-2): Neuer; Rudiger, Boateng, Hummels, Durm; Draxler, Kroos, Bellarabi, Schurrle; Gotze, Muller. REPUBLIC OF IRELAND (prob, 4-5-1): Forde; Meyler, O'Shea, Wilson, Ward; Walters, Whelan, Gibson, Quinn, McGeady; Keane. REFEREE: Damir Skomina (Slv). TV: LIVE on Sky Sports 5 from 7pm (kick-off 7.45). 'We are deficient in certain things, but a bit of fighting spirit, I think, pervades the team and that can help. It will not win you every single game you play in, but it's a grand start.' Anything other than victory for the home side would represent another significant surprise, although O'Neill does not believe Poland's heroics have changed the face of the group. He added: 'I think when the 10 games are played, Germany will find themselves in front in the group. They usually do, and I still think they are the best team in it.","Captain Robbie Keane insists past results against Germany are irrelevant .

"In a weekend where the rest of last season's top four - Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool - all dropped points, Chelsea fans could be forgiven for a bit of crowing. Diego Costa's hat-trick inspired the 4-2 win over Swansea which put the Blues top of the Premier League, with the maximum 12 points from their four games so far. However, the last 10 years suggest Chelsea fans shouldn't count their chickens just yet. Diego Costa (centre) has helped Chelsea to achieve maximum points from their first four games . History suggests that Chelsea fans mustn't get carried away with their team's brilliant start . 2013-14: Arsenal - City win title . 2012-13: Chelsea - United win title . 2011-12: United - City win title . 2010-11: Chelsea - United win title . 2009-10: Chelsea - Chelsea win title . 2008-09: Liverpool - United win title . 2007-08: Arsenal - United win title . 2006-07: Portsmouth - United win title . 2005-06: Chelsea - Chelsea win title . 2004-05: Arsenal - Chelsea win title . Only twice in the past decade have the team who have been top after four games ended up as champions. This time last year Arsenal were looking down on everyone after four games, but come May they were in fourth staring up at title winners Manchester City. The Gunners have made a habit of starting well, but ending up without the coveted trophy. Over the past 10 years Arsene Wenger's side have been top three times during the early stages without managing to finish the job while Manchester United have won the league five times without spectacular starts - indeed, in 2006-07, the early leaders were Portsmouth. And just two years ago Chelsea - then European champions under Roberto Di Matteo - were flying high at the top of the league. Arsenal won four of the opening five games last season but fell away as the season progressed . Manchester City were crowned Premier League champions last season despite a bright start from Arsenal . Manchester United won the Premier League title in 2013 after Chelsea led the way during the early stages . Rafael Benitez took over Chelsea after Di Matteo's eventual sacking but they finished way off the pace of Sir Alex Ferguson's final title at Manchester United. The piece of good news for Jose Mourinho, though, is that the trophy has ended up at Stamford Bridge on the two occasions in which a club ahead after four games has won the Premier League. Mourinho's second season in English football, 2005-06, saw his Chelsea team race into an early lead before claiming a second successive title. And Carlo Ancelotti's 2010 Premier League triumph - part of a Chelsea double - kicked off in the perfect way as they won their first six games. However, history is not on Costa, Fabregas and Co's side - and there may be light at the end of the blue tunnel for Chelsea's challengers. Jose Mourinho's Chelsea won the Premier League after a fine start in the 2005-06 season .

"When Siobhan Fields, 18, from Hamilton was offered a tattoo for her 16th birthday present, she jumped at the chance. But the teen was left humiliated after the bungling tattooist produced a portrait of Marilyn Monroe that looked more like a blow up doll. Now Miss Fields, a hairdresser, has finally managed to have the offending inking covered up and said she is 'chuffed' with the results. Scroll down for video . Much better: Siobhan Fields, 18, has had her bungled Marilyn Monroe tattoo covered up . Miserable: Siobhan was left devastated after tattooist Dave Stewart bungled her dream Marilyn tattoo . The new design, which was done on her 18th birthday on Wednesday, shows a woman’s face with long hair and roses attached to it. Although she underwent laser treatment earlier this year following an appearance on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters, the results weren't quite what she wanted and instead, she decided to have a new tattoo. 'I’m really chuffed with the new tattoo, it looks great,' said a delighted Miss Fields, who had her new inking at the Save Our Souls tattoo parlour in Lanarkshire. 'I made a big mistake by getting the first one done and I’ve definitely learned my lesson. I went for a couple of sessions of laser treatment but it didn’t fully take it away. 'I always knew I was going to get one done as soon as I turned 18 anyway so I just had to be patient and wait.' Inspiration: She had hoped for something resembling the actress (left) but got 'a blow-up doll' instead . Painful: She began  laser treatment after an appearance on Extreme Beauty Disasters but it failed to work . Miss Fields was left devastated after being given a botched tattoo by 'conman' Dave Stewart and later reported him to the police. Speaking about the original inking, she said: 'I looked on the internet for pictures of Marilyn Monroe. 'Then I found the tattooist on a social media website, I had a look through his work and they all seemed really nice. But I later found out they were someone else’s work. 'I could see that it looked awful, as he was doing it, but I was too scared to say anything. It definitely wasn’t a success, it looks horrible.' Miss Fields booked the session with Stewart, of Cumbernauld, after being impressed with designs on his Intenze Tattoos page on Facebook. He was fined £300 for operating a tattoo business without a licence when he appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court last year.

"The dying mother of five children killed in a house fire lovingly wrapped herself around her three-year-old daughter in an attempt to save her from the inferno, an inquest has heard. Dr Sabah Usmani, 44, her sons Muneeb, nine, and Rayyan, six, and daughter Hira, 12, died soon after the blaze in Barn Mead, Harlow, Essex, which police believe was started deliberately in the early hours of October 15 2012. Tragic: Sabah Usmani, her sons Sohaib, 11, Muneeb, nine, and Rayyan, six, and her 12-year-old daughter Hira, died when fire ripped through their Essex home . A third son Sohaib, 11, and daughter Maheen, three, were taken to hospital. He died later that morning while she lived for three more days. The only survivor, Dr Abdul Shakoor, who fought hard to save his wife and children, attended the inquest at Essex Coroner's Court in Chelmsford today. Experts told the hearing that the heat of the fire may have reached 800C. Although the inquest heard that the blaze was most likely started deliberately, coroner Caroline Beasley Murray said there was not enough evidence for her to conclude that the deaths were definitely the result of unlawful killing or an accident. She recorded an open verdict. Blaze: Experts told the hearing today that the heat of the fire may have reached 800C . She added: 'In order to record a conclusion of unlawful killing I would have to be sure that somebody killed another without legal justification and intended to kill or cause serious injury. 'The court has come to the view that, sadly, there is also insufficient evidence to say it was an accident. 'I am recording an open verdict; this basically means that not all of the pieces of the jigsaw are there yet.' Referring to Maheen, she said: 'I'm sure all of us were touched by the evidence that her mother was doing her best to protect her at the end. 'The actions of firefighters were nothing short of heroic and the court would like publicly to thank them.' Devastaed: Dr Abdul Shakoor (centre) is comforted by friends while speaking after today's inquest at Essex Coroner's Court in Chelmsford . Retired fire investigation officer David Hajicostas said Dr Usmani was found crouched over Maheen in a desperate bid to save her - an act which gave the girl three further days of life and a chance of survival. He said: 'She was gathered over her on all fours with a blanket over her.' He described the actions of firefighters as heroic. 'One officer went back into the burning inferno four times and recovered four people,' he said. 'It was between 700C and 800C inside the house at the time of rescue.' Detective Superintendent Rob Vinson, of Essex Police, said all the evidence pointed towards the deaths being murder. Shattered father: Dr Abdul Shakoor fought hard to save his wife and children but was the only one to survive the fire . An aerial picture showing the scene at Barn Mead in Harlow after the blaze which gutted the house . 'Lovely people': A note left with floral tributes at Barn Mead following a house fire on the Harlow street . The front door of the house was open, a laptop was missing and there had been a series of burglaries in the area that night. The fire broke out at the family's home in Harlow . Mr Vinson said that although nobody has been charged, it remains an active investigation. 'It's the largest and most complex investigation that Essex Police has ever undertaken,' he said. Fire investigators found that the blaze was most likely caused by a deliberate act, although it was possible that there had been an accident. Forensic fire specialist Iain Peck, who also examined a car blaze outside the house, said the incidents were likely to be linked. He added: 'These were contemporaneous and linked events - they were separate ignitions but not a coincidence.' All members of the family, originally from Pakistan, died from their injuries and inhalation of fumes, a post-mortem examination found. Speaking outside the inquest, Dr Shakoor said his family, and in particular his mother, were still going through a 'very difficult time'. He added: 'So far they are greatly disappointed that nobody has been convicted or charged even after two years have passed, and they fear the possible dangers from the perpetrators who remain free. Funeral: Dr Abdul Shakoor (third left) walks immediately behind the funeral cortege as it arrives at Parndon Wood Cemetery, in Harlow, for the family's burial in January 2013 . Speaking outside the inquest today, Dr Shakoor said his family, and in particular his mother, were still going through a 'very difficult time' 'I believe the community will come forward with information and possible names of those behind this incident and inform police. 'This will bring great comfort and solace and help us so that we can move forward and lead our normal lives. 'I urge everyone again to please come forward and provide whatever information you have. 'As a great nation we have to make sure that justice should prevail regardless of any bindings and associations so that mums and kids will feel safe on the streets and in their homes.'","Dr Sabah Usmani died while trying to save youngest in tragic Essex blaze .

"The Premier League’s attempt to set up a European competition for Under 21 players has been blocked by UEFA. Officials at the Premier League had 16 clubs across Europe ready to participate in the ‘International Cup’ and address a major concern recently highlighted by FA chairman Greg Dyke’s commission; a lack of meaningful, competitive football for players aged between 18 and 21. But after a lengthy consultation process with UEFA over the formation of the competition the Premier League have been left bitterly disappointed by the European governing body’s refusal to give it their approval. As one observer said, ‘it seems a bit small-minded of UEFA to block it’. Chelsea, celebrating victory in the U21 Premier League above, had been ready to take part in the competition . Sportsmail revealed the Premier League's plans for the competition last month . An impressive group of clubs are ready to sign up to a competition that even had a proposed fixture schedule in place.

While from the rest of Europe Celtic, Athletic Bilbao, Benfica, Borussia Monchengladbach, Schalke, FC Porto, PSV Eindhoven and Villarreal are also ready to take part.

Chelsea youngster Lewis Baker celebrates the winner in the final against Manchester United in May . ‘Clubs, coaches and players are looking for this kind of international experience, at this vital transition phase in players’ careers.

'English football is working incredibly hard to produce more and better home-grown players and the European Under 21s is but one element.

"Firefighters in Missouri have rescued a parachutist who became tangled in the wires of a broadcast tower about 155 feet off the ground after he spent two hours dangling high above the ground. First responders were dispatched Thursday night after the man's parachute became snagged on the wires connected to the KETC-TV tower in south St. Louis County. A firefighter climbed the tower and passed an anchor to the hapless base jumper, later identified as 27-year-old Timothy Church, who released himself from his parachute and was lowered to the ground. Scroll down for video . It's all about the base: A parachutist had to be rescued after he became stuck on the wires of a broadcast tower about 155 feet off the ground following a base jump .

Lawbreakers: Parachutist Timothy Church, 27 (left), has been charged with trespassing on private property, along with 26-year-old Brandon Travis (right), who allegedly helped him climb the tower . Authorities say the daredevil became stranded while attempting to perform a base jump from the broadcast tower belonging to the Nine Network of Public Media. Timothy Church was spotted dangling from the tower in the 5400 block of Butler Hill Road at around 9.30pm. The 27-year-old man was stuck about 155 feet in the air and hanging 20 feet from the tower, according to Mehlville Fire Protection District Chief Brian Hendricks. The parachutist had a cellphone with him and was seen communicating with rescuers on the ground during the operation. At around 11.45pm, a first responder ascended the tower laden with 30lbs of equipment and passed an anchor to the stranded Mr Church, who was then able to cut himself free from the parachute.

He appeared in distress caused by suspension trauma, officials said, but was able to walk on his own to the ambulance. ‘For people to do things such as this and put our people in harm’s way, it is disturbing. It bothers us,’ Hendricks told KMOV.

"Read the report from Sportsmail's Matt Barlow on the rise of Martin Odegaard . Martin Odegaard became the youngest player in the  history of the European Championship as he came on as a substitute in Norway's 2-1 victory over Bulgaria. Aged 15 years and 300 days, Odegaard replaced Cardiff's Mats Moller Daelhi in the 63rd minute, as goals from Tarik Elyounoussi and Havard Nielsen either side of a Nikolay Bodurov equaliser saw the hosts run out winners at the Ullevaal Stadium in Oslo. The European Championship has been running since 1960 and Odegaard beat the previous record held by Sigurdur Jonsson of Iceland, who had held it since playing in a Euro 1984 qualifier aged 16 and 251 days.

The appearance of Odegaard in the Group H Euro 2016 qualifier will have been noted Europe's biggest clubs, who have already been hot on the tail of the wonderkid likened to Lionel Messi. Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid lead the hunt, while Odegaard has been to England to train with Manchester United and has spent time in Germany with Bayern, Stuttgart and Borussia Dortmund. Liverpool are also keen on the Stromsgodset star, aware that Martin and his father Hans-Erik are lifelong Reds supporters. Odegaard made his debut for Norway on August 27 in a friendly against United Arab Emirates and came on against Bulgaria in Oslo with his side pushing for a winner. The record for the youngest player to actually appear in the European Championship finals is Jetro Willems, who at 18 years and 71 days came on for Holland in their Euro 2012 group stage match with Denmark. So another record could be in Odegaard's sight should Norway's positive start in qualification continue and take them to France for the 2016 finals. Elyounoussi's 13th minute strike was cancelled out by Bodurov two minutes before half-time before Nielsen volleyed home the winning goal in the 72nd minute. It brought back-to-back wins for Norway who sit third in the qualifying group behind Italy and Croatia who have maximum points after their first three games.

"An 18-year-old girl being held in quarantine in Queensland has tested negative for Ebola. Initial tests on the West African woman, after she showed possible symptoms of the disease, have given her the all clear. The unnamed teen has been held at the the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital since she developed a fever this weekend. 'Yes, they are negative,' a spokeswoman for Queensland Health told AAP on Monday. The woman arrived in Australia from Guinea about 12 days ago with eight members of her extended family. Scroll down for video . The woman will remain at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital for more Ebola tests . Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young, pictured here in 2009, said the chance the woman has Ebola is low . All of the family members were placed in home quarantine immediately after their arrival. In a press conference on Sunday evening, Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young assured Australians the risk of the teenager spreading Ebola - if she is infected - was very low. 'She's been here in Brisbane for 11 days, there's no risk for anyone on that plane,' Dr Young said. 'You need to have symptoms and be excreting the virus, in vomit, in faeces, in sweat, in urine and she doesn't have any symptoms so she hasn't been excreting the virus so someone could get infected.' The health officer said Queensland had been aware of the family's arrival, and the woman, two other adults, and six children had not come into contact with anyone since being in Australia. The 18-year-old woman recently arrived in Australia from West Africa, and Saturday night had a high fever . Staff were checking the family's health daily and on Saturday night the 18-year-old developed a fever . 'There is no risk to the community at all because she (and the family) hasn't left the house or had any visitors,' Dr Young said. Staff were checking the family's health daily and on Saturday night the 18-year-old developed a fever. Doctors received results of the patient's first Ebola test on Monday morning, but the woman cannot be completely cleared until a secondary test is completed in three days. Until then the patient must remain in isolation. Thousands of people have already died from the virus in West African nations such as Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia . 'She's in a negative pressure room, with another room attached to it and all the staff going into that room will be wearing full personal protective gear,' Dr Young said. Despite this, the teenager is doing 'very well' and she and her family have been 'very responsible'. 'It's unlikely she has the disease as she doesn't remember coming into contact with anyone who had the disease,' Dr Young added. The teenager is doing 'very well' and she and her family have been 'very responsible' 'The most important thing is that although what is going on in West Africa is tragic circumstances ... the risk of getting Ebola here in Australia is extraordinarily low.' This is the second scare this month after Cairns nurse Sue Ellen Kovack returned from Sierre Leone exhibiting symptoms. She had been working as a volunteer treating patients but was later cleared of having the potentially deadly virus.","A woman in isolation at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital has tested negative for Ebola .

"A photographer has captured some of the busiest European cities by day and night in the same incredible images. Stephen Wilkes, 57, took thousands of photographs over a 15-hour period in bustling hotspots like London and Paris. He created the  images by spending an entire day and night shooting more than 1,500 photographs from the same spot. The Eiffel Tower in Paris: Shimmering lights at night while tourists take pictures in the daytime . London: Stephen Wilkes spends an entire day and night shooting on location from the same spot . Dedicated Stephen then returns to his studio, sometimes spending more than a month blending the shots into one final image. His pictures include an amazing shot of the Eiffel Tower shimmering at night with tourists taking photographs while still bathed in daylight. And another shows the London Eye at night while day-trippers float along the Thames during the day. One image of Trafalgar Square is made up of around 50 shots throughout the day and features around 300 people who visited the landmark. Stephen, from New York, selects the best for his widely acclaimed signature 'Day to Night' series. He said: 'As I started to explore this series I began receiving requests globally to shoot different cities. The hive of activity around Trafalgar Square is beautifully reflected in this day/night photo . Jerusalem: Wilkes returns to his studio, sometimes spending more than a month blending the shots into one final image . 'The excitement built around the world, so I decided I wanted to shoot Paris and London - possibly at the same time of year. 'I love the autumnal light in those pictures - I find it the most beautiful time of year. 'We control as many variables in these pictures as possible, but it's all about what happens on a given day at a given place. 'For me, that's what's most exciting - I am almost always working in distress.' Pont de la Tournelle: Wilkes takes thousands of photographs over a 15-hour period in bustling tourist hotspots . Tel Aviv: A book is also set to be released once he has reached 40 day-to-night works . Stephen revealed he enjoys shooting locations of which people have a collective memory - such as tourist hotspots. And he hopes to continue his series in other European locations such as Amsterdam, Berlin, Rome and Venice - as well as Egypt and Hong Kong. He also has a series of  shots planned to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the US National Park Service. And a book is also in the works and will be released once he has reached 40 day-to-night works. Wilkes has captured some of the busiest European cities by day and night in the same incredible images . He added: 'I like places where people spend their time - there can be a different vibe at night and something completely unique during the day. 'With the Trafalgar Square photograph, you gain perspective as you go back into the image - like multiple stages in a theatre. 'Years ago I imagined changing time within a single photograph, compressing the best moments of the day and night into a single image. 'Photographic technology has now evolved to allow my dreams to now become reality.'","Stephen Wilkes, from New York, spends an entire day photographing tourist locations .

"Louis van Gaal will walk into Yeovil’s ‘bunker’ on Sunday, the ominous-sounding office where manager Gary Johnson has been plotting the downfall of English football’s biggest name for the last six days. But if he wants a good glass of red wine, whatever the result, he has been warned he may have to bring his own. ‘There are no windows,’ said Johnson before a game he puts up there with the biggest in the club’s history. ‘If it’s fresh air he wants then we’ll have to go outside. VIDEO Scroll down for FATV's preview of Yeovil vs Manchester United . Gary Johnson's Yeovil welcome Manchester United to Huish Park in the FA Cup third round on Sunday . Johnson joked that Louis van Gaal will have to bring his own wine if he wants an expensive bottle post-match . United striker Radamel Falcao earns as much in one day as Yeovil pay out in weekly wages . Falcao scores for United as Louis van Gaal's side drew 1-1 with Stoke on New Year's Day . ‘Unfortunately, if Louis wants an expensive bottle of wine in my office afterwards he’s going to have to bring it with him — he’s probably got a stash somewhere in his kit bag. We’ll go for a mediocre red, but if he wants a real top one then I’ll be happy to share.’ How much they are willing to spend on a decent Merlot isn’t the only thing that’s a little different about these two clubs. Yeovil’s weekly wage budget stands at £37,500 — the amount United striker Radamel Falcao earns in a single day. Wayne Rooney takes home more in a month than the minnows shell out in a year. Not that it really bothers Johnson, who is the epitome of pragmatism but holds that sparkle which fills this small Somerset town with hope of an unlikely upset to match their greatest ever, against Sunderland in 1949. Incidentally, the prize for that scalp was an 8-0 fifth-round drubbing by United. Yeovil Town goalkeeper Dickie Dyke (third right) punches clear during the 1949 victory over Sunderland . Yeovil player-manager Alec Stock, who scored the first goal against Sunderland in the fourth round of the FA Cup, is carried shoulder high during a dance and cabaret at the Prince's Ballroom to celebrate the victory . Manchester United fan John Butterfield attended the fifth round FA Cup game against Yeovil in 1949 . ‘We’d like to keep our reputation as a good FA Cup side,’ he added. ‘We’ve told all the new lads that Yeovil were the best non-League team for Cup upsets for years, and that we do well when we’re the underdogs. We’re certainly the underdogs here by a million miles.’ They are even more up against it than when the draw was made, with Johnson fully admitting that Yeovil have taken their eye off the ball since beating Accrington in the second round replay. None more so than on Monday, when they were battered 3-0 at home by Leyton Orient in a defeat which leaves them bottom of League One. Johnson's side go into the match with United on the back of a 3-0 defeat by Leyton Orient last Monday . ‘Some of the players subconsciously saved themselves in that game and lost their place for United. They will learn from that pretty quick. ‘If Louis watched us against Leyton Orient he’d probably feel they could put out their Under 14s against us. ‘Hopefully the boys will go in with a different feeling, without the pressure of the points. Now it’s finally here we just can’t wait.’ Johnson, who says his experience managing Latvia stands him in good stead for games such as this, can’t be far off legend status in this pocket of the West Country. He was the man who won promotion to the Football League in 2003 and then did the unthinkable by taking Yeovil to the Championship two years ago. Johnson was not happy with some of his players' attitudes during the defeat by Orient . Johnson embraces Yeovil captain Joe Edwards after the second round win Accrington Stanley in December . League One Yeovil stand to pocket £221,000 from the third round tie with Man United. The FA dish out £27,000 in prize money for a second-round victory, plus the club will earn a further £144,000 from BT Sport, who will broadcast the third round tie live. Yeovil are set to earn in the region of £50,000 in gate receipts with the United tie  sold out at Yeovil’s 9,565-seater stadium. Yeovil could be set to earn a staggering £1.5m from the third round tie if they force a replay at old Trafford. ‘If we win they might even put a statue up of me,’ he laughed. ‘I reckon I’ve earned one already, but the chairman says I’ve got to do a little bit more yet. I’m only 5ft 7in so it wouldn’t take a lot of metal, would it?’ Johnson’s side are going to have to show more than a bit of mettle if they want to inflict anything worse than a cheap bottle of wine on Van Gaal. However, when the two teams walk out of the Huish Park tunnel there will be one among them wearing a United shirt under his Yeovil Town kit. Ten-year-old Harris, a United fan, was handed a late Christmas present by his father, Yeovil striker James Hayter, when he was told he had got him a place as a home mascot for the game. Yeovil striker James Hayter's Manchester United-supporting son will be a mascot for the tie . Hayter celebrates after scoring in the FA Cup third round exactly one year before the United clash . The fixture is one of the biggest in Yeovil’s history and Hayter admits, at 35 years old, that it will be the greatest in his long career as a forward. But there was one in the Hayter household who celebrated even more than him when Van Gaal’s team were pulled out of the hat. ‘Harris said he wants to wear his Manchester United kit under his Yeovil kit,’ Hayter explained. ‘He was buzzing about the draw. I only told him on Tuesday he was going to get to be a mascot as well. So it’s even better he’s going to get to shake hands with all the players. He just can’t wait for the game.’ Hayter’s wife and their two daughters will be at the game, too, although his parents, Mary and Richard, are unable to attend. They famously missed the moment their son scored the fastest hat-trick in Football League history in 2004. Hayter, playing for Bournemouth at the time, arrived from the bench in the 84th minute to score three times in just 140 seconds. But his parents had left the ground early to catch a ferry back to their home in the Isle of Wight. Hayter is congratulated by his team-mates after his third round goal against Leyton Orient in 2014 . Johnson will be hoping for more third-round heroics from the Yeovil front man on Sunday . ‘They were listening to the radio on the way back,’ Hayter said. ‘They were obviously pleased, but they’d left to get the earlier ferry. They still shake their heads about it.’ His father is too unwell to travel to the match on Sunday, but both parents will be watching back home on television, eager not to miss this one. Hayter spent a large part of his career at Bournemouth, raised on stories of them knocking United out of the FA Cup in 1984 when Harry Redknapp was in charge. Yeovil’s giant-killing exploits are even more legendary and an unlikely victory for the League One team against this United side, worth hundreds of millions of pounds, will perhaps mark their greatest moment of all. Everyone in a Yeovil shirt will be celebrating wildly if they can pull it off, apart from one young boy with his Manchester United kit on underneath.","Manchester United travel to Yeovil in the FA Cup third round on Sunday .

"A grandmother was told Christmas decorations outside her home should be taken down because housing bosses feared they were a health and safety risk. Sharon Antell has been putting up lights - including an inflatable Santa and snowman - outside her home in Neath, south Wales for 20 years. She was even more determined to make the area look festive this year after a nearby public display of Christmas lights was axed. Sharon Antell was told she should not put up the traditional Christmas display on the porch of her home in Neath, south Wales because of fears she might fall. Her landlords have now backed down and agreed she can leave the inflatable snowman and Santa in place over the festive season . But she was left stunned this year when she received a letter from her landlords telling her they breached health and safety regulations. Coastal Housing Association said they feared the 50-year-old could fall while putting them up and threatened to take them down before Christmas. The letter she received from the housing association stated: 'Following the recent site visit to look at the Christmas decorations it has been decided that they must be removed from the porch roof. 'This decision has been made on health and safety grounds. We cannot allow residents access to the roof via the communal window and trailing extension leads through the communal areas. 'I understand you have gone through the expense of purchasing the decoration but permission should have been asked before putting them up. Landlords insist Mrs Antell must allow them to remove the display of Santa and a snowman from her porch . 'I would ask that you do not go back out on the roof and we'll arrange an appointment with you to bring in the decorations. If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact the office.' After the edict caused outrage among locals, the company have now agreed to leave the display in place over the festive season. But they are still insisting Mrs Antell allow their workers to come and remove the decorations in the New Year. Mrs Antell, a mother of eight and grandmother of 16, said: 'I have been doing this for the last 20 years and I've never had an accident. I think it is disgusting - Christmas only happens once a year. 'I told the council I would take full responsibility for myself if an accident did happen but that's not enough for them. 'People are always telling me how festive it looks. The children and grandchildren love seeing Santa in lights. 'But I had a letter through this week telling me I'm not allowed to do it and that they would send someone out to take them down. 'They said it's for health and safety reasons. I couldn't believe it.' Coastal Housing Association confirmed they were concerned about the display, but have since agreed to leave them up. A spokesman said: 'The roof is about 12ft off the ground and only accessible by a window. 'The safety of tenants was of paramount importance and we were concerned that she may fall. 'In this instance, we would have been happy to help Ms Antell put up the Christmas decorations. 'The decorations can remain as long as she agrees not to go back out onto the roof again. When Christmas is over so we can take the decorations down ourselves.' The government ordered a purge on health and safety Scrooges who ruin the spirit of Christmas three years ago. They released a list of false 'Christmas elf and safety' edicts wrongly used to ban festive fun. The ten-point list of 'ridiculous' Christmas safety bans, compiled by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), included:- . - Children banned by teachers from having snowball fights in case injured pupils seek compensation. The government announced a crackdown on festive season red tape and said snowball fights are safe . - Homeowners and businessmen being sued for clearing the snow outside their properties by passers-by who had slipped over. -Panto performers ordered not to throw sweets into the audience for fear of injuring them; . -Santa's sleigh outlawed for posing a traffic risk. Father Christmas was banned from riding his sleigh through Alnwick, Northumberland, after council officials said their insurance would not cover it. Other Santas have been ordered to wear high visibility vests over their traditional red robes. Tory Chris Grayling said at the time of the announcement: 'We're determined to stamp out the health and safety kill-joys who try to bring the spirit of Scrooge to Christmas events.'","Grandmother was determined to put up display after local lights were axed .

"Airline Jetstar has come under fire for not providing a wheelchair to help a woman take her disabled sister from the plane to the terminal. Perth woman Danae Florias and her sister 26 year old Marissa, who has cerebal palsy, had been on a holiday to Melbourne last month and were returning to Perth on Jetstar. The woman was disgusted with the treatment her and her sister were shown by the airline, telling Nine News she was forced to carry her sister 100 metres to the terminal without a wheelchair. Scroll down to video . Danae Florias (pictured) is angry with Jetstar after she was forced to carry her disabled sister Marissa (pictured) from the plane to the terminal at Perth airport after returning from a holiday to Melbourne . Danae Florias (pictured right) was left fuming with Jetstar after she said she had to carry her disabled sister Marissa (pictured) from the plane to the terminal because there was no wheelchair and then had to assemble a wheelchair herself . It's believed the wheelchair was supposed to be there, but wasn't, and when she got to the terminal, she had to assemble a supplied wheelchair herself without any help from staff. 'Eventually my sister started crying, thinking they'd lost her wheelchair. She gets very anxious and upset easy so I couldn't calm her down,' said Ms Florias. She told Nine News the airline failed to give her any answers as to why it had neglected them or even just point them in the right direction. 'I feel so disgusted and disappointed,' she said. Ms Florias complained to the airline but did not receive a response until today. Jetstar confirmed they had contacted the customer this morning to apologise for the regrettable incident. Jetstar have confirmed they have now contacted Ms Dorias and offered an apology and are investigating the matter . Perth woman Danae Florias (pictured) said there was supposed to be a wheelchair there for her disabled sister Marissa (pictured) but there wasn't forcing her to carry her to the terminal without any help from Jetstar staff . Jetstar said their customer service officer had a wheelchair on hand to assist with the customer’s transfer from the aircraft to the terminal but it did not meet her specific needs at Perth airport . When Daily Mail contacted the airline, it said that other media had not told the whole story behind the incident. 'While our customer service officer had a wheelchair on hand to assist with the customer’s transfer from the aircraft to the terminal, we understand this did not meet her specific needs. He then offered to provide additional support,' said a spokesperson. In a statement the airline confirmed that it had advised Ms Florias that the investigation into the matter, and the ongoing chain of events, was ongoing. 'Every year Jetstar carries 60,000 passengers with specific needs,' said a Jetstar spokesperson. 'These reports are concerning and do not reflect the normal flight experience of our disabled passengers, many of whom fly with Jetstar often.' 'We apologise to the family for the distress involved and we're investigating how this occurred.' Danae Florias (pictured) said she wasn't offered any help by Jetstar staff . 'Eventually my sister started crying, thinking they'd lost her wheelchair. She gets very anxious and upset easy so I couldn't calm her down,' said Ms Florias . An investigation is being held by Jetstar following the incident involving Danae Florias (pictured) and her 26 year old disabled sister Marissa. They have also apologised to her . This is the latest bungle in a series of incidents the airline has come under fire for of it's treatment of customers with a disabilities. In 2009 the budget line upset three time Paralympic gold medallist Kurt Fearnley, who said he felt humiliated when the airline wouldn't allow him to use his own wheelchair. And more recently, renowned Australian musician Jim Conway was left frustrated by the airline, unable to board a flight to Melbourne earlier this year, because it did not have measures in place to transfer him safely into his seat. Ms Florias told Nine news that she would never fly Jetstar again.","Danae Florias was forced to carry her disabled sister, Marissa, off a Jetstar flight, 100 metres to the terminal .

"Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Montella fully expects sought-after winger Juan Cuadrado to stay at the club despite media reports linking him with a move to the Premier League. The Colombia international has been a rumoured target of Manchester United in the past few years while Chelsea are reportedly willing to pay Cuadrado's buyout clause set at £26.8million to acquire him this month. 'As of today, there's no possibility that Cuadrado will leave Fiorentina,' Montella told the Italian press. 'He (Cuadrado) knows that certain things are exaggerated. Juan Cuadrado (centre) celebrates after scoring against Atalanta to reach the Copa Italia quarter-finals . Chelsea are reportedly ready to meet the winger's £26.8m buyout clause to bring him to Stamford Bridge . 'There are just rumours and he is not paying attention to all that.' The 26-year-old joined Fiorentina in 2012 from Udinese and has been a regular in Montella's side since. Cuadrado scored 15 goals in 43 appearances in all competitions for the Viola in the 2013-14 campaign. The Colombian came to the attention of clubs including Man United  following his World Cup performances . The South American, who was one of the stand-out players alongside James Rodriguez for Colombia in last year's World Cup in Brazil, is under contract at the Artemio Franchi stadium until June 2019. He has scored four goals and set up four more in 16 league appearances for Fiorentina so far this season. Cuadrado scored from the penalty spot to help Fiorentina beat Atalanta 3-1 on Wednesday night and reach the quarter finals of the Coppa Italia.

"Ian Jones, 45, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, allegedly grabbed a student's breasts and told her she had a peachy bum, a court has heard . A college tutor allegedly grabbed a female student's breasts, told her she had a peachy bottom and offered to pay her £30 if she took off her underwear in public, a court has heard. Ian Jones, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, also lifted up a student's top in front of classmates and grabbed another girl's thong before commenting on its colour, the court was told. The 45-year-old also allegedly described another girl's breasts as 'a couple of airbags', and mimicked having sex with another alleged victim when she went to pick up her bag. Prosecutor Graeme Simpson told the court how Jones had allegedly abused his position of trust by 'bullying' the girls in an 'overtly sexual' way. He is accused of 18 charges of sexual assault against five female pupils which are alleged to have taken place between 2008 and 2012. At the time of the alleged offences, Mr Jones was teaching a motor vehicle repair course at North Warwickshire and Hinckley College in Nuneaton, Warwarkshire. Speaking about the first victim, Mr Simpson said: 'He walked up to her and put his hand into her coat pocket and moved his hand and touched the crotch of her jeans. 'She asked what he was doing, and he said he was looking for fags. 'Then when she bent over to pick up her bag, he put his hands on her breasts and tried to pull her backwards.' Warwick Crown Court heard how Jones was arrested in 2012 following an incident with a girl at the college. When a police investigation was launched, three other pupils came forward. Speaking about one of the incidents, the girl told the jury how the man approached her from behind, pushed her so she was bending over and pushed himself against her as if simulating intercourse. She said: 'I stood up and turned to face him. He put one of his hands in my coat pocket. He tried to push his hand down towards my crotch area. 'I managed to pull that hand out, and he tried to put his other hand in my other pocket and I grabbed it to stop him. 'I just wanted to get out of the room because he had unnerved me. I turned round and bent over to pick up my bag and I felt both of his hands with some force grab both of my breasts. 'It took me a while to get his hands off. I left. I was shaking and crying. It shook me up.' The jury was told how, on one occasion, she was talking to some other students when slapped her bottom and said she had a 'nice peachy bum'. Jones is on trial at Warwick Crown Court (pictured) accused of 18 sexual assaults against five different pupils at a college in Nuneaton. He denies the charges . Speaking to the jury, she told: 'I said 'I know it is,' but I found it quite disgusting. No-one has the right to do that. 'The next day I told my tutor. He told me I needed to report it, but I didn't want to report it at the time. I thought I could handle it myself. I didn't want to make a big fuss.' But the court heard how the girl confided in her boyfriend and her tutor referred her to the college's safeguarding team. She told the jury: 'At first he seemed the same as my teachers but then I noticed a change in the way he behaved towards me. 'He began looking me up and down and making comments, which made me feel not very nice, nervous.' She told how, after just a few weeks, Jones walked over to her while she was with friends during her lunchbreak. She said: 'He pulled the front part of my top forward towards him and leaned forward so he could look down my top. I told him to get off. He said ""they look good today"". I felt violated.' On another occasion, Jones saw her in the college car park and told her he could see her knickers through her skirt, the court was told. She said: 'He said he would give me money if I took my pants off and gave them to him. He took out his wallet and took £20 and £10 out and offered to give it to me.' Jones is also accused of lifting up another girl's top 'exposing her bra and breasts in front of her classmates,' the girl told the court. She added: 'I felt guilty because he'd done things to me I should have reported earlier. If I had, maybe he wouldn't have done that to her.' Jones denies the charges. The trial continues.

"Host commentator . Host commentator . Newcastle are interested in MK Dons wonderkid Dele Alli. The 18-year-old midfielder is being courted by a number of the Premier League's big guns - Liverpool and Manchester City included. But despite not having a manager in place, the Magpies want to land Alli this month and are set to make an approach for the youngster. Bakary Sako is wanted by Tony Pulis as the West Bromwich Albion head coach considers a bold move for the Wolverhampton Wanderers winger. Pulis is determined to add pace and width to his team and the 26-year-old fits the bill having scored seven goals in 27 games for West Brom’s arch rivals this season. Sako only has six months left on his contract and Kenny Jackett has spoken about potentially doing a deal if a large enough bid comes in from a Premier League club. Real Madrid have no plans to let midfielder Asier Illarramendi leave in the January transfer window and he remains an important part of the European champions' squad, coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Friday. Illarramendi, 24, joined from Real Sociedad for a fee of £23.5m in July 2013 as a long-term replacement for Xabi Alonso but even though Alonso has moved on Illarramendi has been unable to hold down a starting place. The imminent arrival of another defensive midfielder, Brazilian Lucas Silva, has prompted speculation Illarramendi will leave, with Real's struggling La Liga rivals Athletic Bilbao and English Premier League side Arsenal reportedly interested in signing him. West Brom are closing in on the signing of Shola Ameobi. The former Newcastle striker is available on a free transfer after leaving Turkish side Gaziantep. The Baggies have agreed a deal with the 33-year-old as head coach Tony Pulis looks to beef up his forward line. The 30-year-old Ivory Coast international arrives from Serie A side Palermo. Jose Mourinho admitted he would be willing to sell Andre Schurrle if a 'phenomenal' offer was made for the midfielder. Mourinho said the German, who he insisted he wants to remain at Chelsea, would be selected for Saturday's's FA Cup fourth round match against Bradford but conceded he may be forced to sell. The principle is that we would like him (Schurrle) to stay,' said Mourinho. 'The question is not to be allowed or not allowed. The question is to have a phenomenal offer and a player to be super keen of accept a new challenge in his career. We don't want to sell our players. 'But for Shurrle to get a first team place he must start playing better than Eden Hazard and Willian.' Arsenal could be set to miss out on signing Tolgay Arslan, who is close to agreeing terms with Besiktas. The Hamburg defensive midfielder and his representatives are waiting on a decision from Arsene Wenger before finalising terms with the Turkish club. Wenger has been monitoring the player, who is available for free in the summer but can discuss pre-contract terms with clubs outside of the Bundesliga now. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has confirmed that The Hammers are one of the clubs chasing Darren Fletcher but says they are yet to speak to the Manchester United midfielder. Fletcher, who has made 342 appearances for the Red Devils since making his debut in 2003, has only six months left on his contract at Old Trafford and is struggling to establish himself under new boss Louis van Gaal. Tony Pulis has admitted West Brom are in talks to sign the 30-year-old Scot and Allardyce hopes Fletcher will make a final decision soon. West Brom are set to make a fresh offer for Nottingham Forest forward Michail Antonio. The Championship club have already knocked back an initial attempt from Tony Pulis to snare the 24-year-old winger. But the Baggies are preparing a second offer to sign the winger this month. Pulis is finding difficulty in landing his first choice wing option Callum McManaman from Wigan and is exploring alternatives. Queens Park Rangers' Matt Phillips, a player who has been scouted by Pulis in the past, is another option for WBA. Crystal Palace are set to revisit their interest in Lille left-back Pape Souare as their move for Neil Taylor continues to drag on. Souare was a target for the club prior to Neil Warnock's sacking, but the Eagles have since switched their attentions to Swansea's Taylor. But Palace are struggling to agree a fee for the Wales international, already having a £4.5million offer rejected. And Alan Pardew is considering turning to Souare in his attempts to land a new left-back. Queens Park Rangers are also tracking the Frenchman, but will struggle to get a loan deal over the line due to their lack of finances. M'Vila, who was once a target for Arsenal, is currently on loan at Inter Milan - but the Italians are willing to cut the deal short. Swans boss Garry Monk has cash to spend following the sale of Wilfried Bony to Manchester City for £28million. Arsenal will resist any offers for Nacho Monreal this month after Atletico Bilbao enquired about the defender. The La Liga club have shown an interest in the Gunners' versatile defender, but were told he will not be leaving the Emirates Stadium. Monreal has been an important figure for Arsene Wenger's side this season, playing regularly at central defence and left-back for the injury hit Gunners. Bilbao may return for Monreal in the summer when they'll have a better chance of nabbing the Spaniard. Tottenham are showing an interest in Feyenoord winger Jean-Paul Boetius. Spurs are having major difficulty in shifting some of their deadwood out of the club this month, a struggle that is restricting Mauricio Pochettino's attempts to sign new players. It is hoped the departure of Kyle Naughton to Swansea will trigger the start of a number of deals in and out of Spurs before the transfer deadline. And Dutch forward Boetius, 20, is a player interesting the North London club. Serie A side Torino are in for Queens Park Rangers wideman Adel Taarabt.

Arsenal may have struggled for trophies in the last decade, but surely with this XI they would have been conquering Europe for many years. Angel di Maria is the latest of a long list of players who Arsene Wenger admitted narrowly missed out on a move to north London. The team may be top heavy, and would most definitely be high on entertainment and slightly creaky at the back, while bringing trophies and goals to the Emirates Stadium. Chelsea have seen an opening bid of £16million rejected for Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Douglas Costa, according to the player himself. Costa confirmed to local press on Shakhtar’s South American tour that Chelsea’s initial offer had been rejected – but said he would speak to his club to try to push a move through. ‘It’s a dream to play for Chelsea, a unique chance. I will try to negotiate,’ he told Brazil’s Globo Esporte. Ukrainian champions Shakhtar are known to difficult to negotiate with, making it perhaps unsurprising that Chelsea’s bid, understood to be £16m, was rejected. QPR have been offered Corinthians striker Alexandre Pato. The 25-year-old, who previously played for Italian giants AC Milan, could make the move to west London in this transfer window. Pato is on loan from Corinthians at Sao Paulo - where he has scored 12 goals in 30 appearances since joining earlier this year. Everton forward Samuel Eto'o is in Italy for a medical with Sampdoria as he looks to seal his move to the Serie A club. The former Chelsea and Barcelona man flew out of England on Thursday and is set to complete his transfer by the end of Friday.Roberto Martinez initially said he wanted Eto'o to stay at Goodison Park but now seems resigned to losing the 33-year-old. Representatives of Italian club Sampdoria came to London in an attempt to speed up the transfer due to concerns it wouldn't be completed before the February 2 deadline. Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny's position has been cast into further doubt after it emerged the club are monitoring Fiorentina goalkeeper Norberto Neto. Sportsmail revealed earlier this month that the Gunners will make a new No 1 a summer priority. And club scouts have made checks on Brazil keeper Neto - who is also a target for Liverpool and Juventus - ahead of a potential summer move. David de Gea’s Manchester United future was thrown into doubt on Thursday night as his agent failed to rule out a move to Real Madrid in the summer.De Gea has 18 months left on his contract and has yet to agree new terms to stay at Old Trafford as he takes stock of his future with Real watching developments.His agent Jorge Mendes, who also represents Cristiano Ronaldo, was asked by Spanish media if he could see the 24-year-old moving to Madrid.'David is amazing, he’s brilliant,’ the Portuguese agent told Marca. ‘He’s a Man United player and has a contract there.

"Seventeen migrants have died in the Strait of Sicily after trying to cross the Mediterranean in an inflatable boat, the Italian navy said today. Sailors rescued 278 migrants but found 16 others dead, and one more who died shortly after help arrived. The dead apparently succumbed to hypothermia and dehydration in one of three boats found yesterday south of the island of Lampedusa. And in the port of Empedocle, health workers carried out the grim task of transferring the deceased from a navy ship straight into coffins. Seventeen migrants have died in the Strait of Sicily after trying to cross the Mediterranean in an inflatable boat, the Italian navy said today. Above, the survivors wait to be rescued . In the Sicilian port of Empedocle, health workers carried out the grim task of transferring the deceased from a navy ship straight into coffins . The dead apparently succumbed to hypothermia and dehydration in one of three boats found yesterday south of the island of Lampedusa . Some 3,200 migrants have died this year trying to reach Europe from Africa, the International Organisation for Migration has said . There were 75 survivors from the boat carrying the corpses and another 202 people were rescued from the two other inflatable boats found in the same area. Photographs released by the navy showed standing passengers packed into the overcrowded outboard-powered boats. Some 3,200 migrants have died this year trying to reach Europe from Africa, the International Organisation for Migration has said. Many of them are fleeing conflict and human rights abuses at home. Sailors rescued 278 migrants but found 16 others dead in one of the vessels, and another who died shortly after help arrived . Photographs released by the navy showed standing passengers packed into the overcrowded outboard-powered boats . Italy is closing its 'Mare Nostrum' search and rescue mission which has saved some 100,000 migrants, and making way for a smaller pan-European project called Triton. Mare Nostrum, which included five warships on permanent patrol, was launched last October after more than 360 migrants died when their boat capsized a mile off the coast of Lampedusa. The mission cost nearly 10million euros (£7.9m) a month, becoming a controversial strain on an economy that is suffering its third recession in six years. Spain's Marine Rescue service has saved 28 African migrants from an inflatable boat in waters off south-east Spain, and is searching for 23 others believed missing after the vessel ran into stormy weather. A spokesman said the rescue took place today in the Mediterranean, 20 miles off Cabo de Gata cape. She said the rescued migrants confirmed there had been 51 people aboard the 33ft-long boat and that many had fallen into the sea when the vessel ran into high waves and winds on Thursday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with the service's regulations. African migrants seeking a better life in Europe often try to reach Spain by crossing the Mediterranean Sea from Morocco in small boats.","Sailors rescued 278 migrants but found 16 others dead in the vessel, and another who died shortly after help arrived .

"President Obama admitted Sunday that as the nation's top Democrat, he bears the blame for his party's historic losses in Tuesday's midterm congressional elections – but insisted moments later that his policies are sound, and signaled that he will double down on his most controversial plans. 'We got beat,' Obama said during a wide-ranging CBS News interview, acknowledging that his Jimmy Carter-like approval ratings – in the high 30s according to some polls – handed Republicans control of the U.S. Senate. 'Whenever, as the head of the party, it doesn't do well, I've got to take responsibility for it,' he told 'Face the Nation' anchor Bob Schieffer. 'The message that I took from this election, and we've seen this in a number of elections, successive elections, is people want to see this city work. And they feel as if it's not working.' But in what seemed like the second half of the same breath, Obama took credit for handling the not-button Ebola crisis, pledged to double-down on his plan for an intensely unpopular immigration policy shift, claimed that Friday's mini-troop-surge in Iraq will put the ISIS terror army on its heels and insisted that America's economy would be a shambles without him. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama gave CBS anchor Bob Schieffer a rare sit-down interview on Sunday . Obama took responsibility for Democrats' historic election losses on Tuesday but paradoxically insisted on a my-way-or-the-highway approach to some of the domestic issues that got his party in trouble . 'It was worse' in 2009, he said, 'because the economy – not just here in the United States but globally – was in a freefall.' 'I have great confidence in the American people and I have great confidence in this administration being able to work through and eventually solve problems. Sometimes we don't do it at the speed that keeps up with, you know, the press cycle.'. He said his White House has 'handled Ebola well.' A MailOnline/YouGov poll published six days ago found that Americans disagree. Just 34 per cent 'told pollsters that they have faith in the president to handle the Ebola crisis effectively,' compared to 49 per cent who don't. A 55 per cent majority said the administration has been 'slow to react' to the crisis. Obama addressed his Friday announcement that he gave the Pentagon permission to send an additional 1,500 ground troops into Iraq – officially as advisers. They will supplement 1,400 already in the war theatre, and bring the total deployment authorization number to 3,100. That move, he said, 'signals a new phase' in the fight against the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, but he pledged that American servicemen and women won't find themselves taking or returning fire. A former senior Pentagon official told MailOnline on Friday that such a claim is far-fetched, and noted that America's protracted and deadly war in Vietnam similarly began with promises that U.S. troops would only be inserted as 'advisers' to South Vietnamese military planners. 'No one really believes the president and his advisers – and they're some smart people – aren't already inserting Special Operators who are armed for combat, probably in both Iraq and Syria,' the former official said. But Obama told Schieffer that 'what hasn't changed is our troops are not going to be engaged in combat.' It's only 'Iraqi ground troops,' he said, 'that can start pushing them back.' Overall, Obama described his latest battle chess move as an effort to put Iraq' forces and Jurdish Peshmerga fighters on the other side of the ball for a change. 'Rather than just try to halt ISIL's momentum,' he explained, using his own preferred acronym for ISIS, 'we're now in a position to start going on some offense.' 'The airstrikes have been very effective in degrading ISIL's capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making.' With Democrats reeling and Republicans strutting after Tuesday's seismic power shift, Obama said Sunday that he still won't back down from his threat to steamroll the GOP with an executive order changing the status of millions of illegal immigrants. On Thursday House Speaker John Boehner warned that if the president acts without the say-so of Congress, it would 'poison the well' for cooperation during Obama's last two years in office. Obama, though, framed the confrontation as if he held all the cards. FINALLY: 'Rather than just try to halt ISIL's momentum,' Obama said, 'we're now in a position to start going on some offense' 'Their time hasn't run out,' he said. 'The minute they pass a bill that addresses the problems with immigration reform, I will sign it and it supersedes whatever actions I take. And I'm encouraging them to do so.' But 'we've got to sell it,' he said of Democrats. 'We've got to reach out to the other side and, where possible, persuade.' Obama prefers a new 'comprehensive' immigration law styled after the so-called 'Gang of Eight' bill that passed last year in the Senate but was considered dead-on-arrival in the House. If Obama somehow gets what he wants, he said, 'nobody's going to be happier than me to sign it, because that means it will be permanent rather than temporary.' That's an acknowledgement that whatever he does unilaterally could disappear if a Republican president were to take power in 2017 and undo it. Overall, the president sounded more like a middle-manager than the most powerful politician in the world. 'I think that what you'll see' in his last two years in office, he said, 'is a constant effort to improve the way we deliver service to customers.' And he spoke generously of his own political acumen – and of his abilities in Washington's perpetual arm-twisting games. 'I love this job,' Obama said. 'If your name is Barack Hussein Obama, you had to have liked politics in order to get into this office. ... I got into politics because I believed I could make a difference, and I would not have been successful and would not be sitting at this desk every day if I didn't love politics.' He pointed to the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act as an example, saying it required 'a whole bunch of arm twisting' to get passed. Democrats pushed the Obamacare law through Congress without a single Republican vote. AND HE'S OFF: Obama left for China on Sunday to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit, where he can expect a confrontation with Russian President Vladimir Putin . On his foreign policy, Obama discussed his outreach to Iran generally but wouldn't comment on reports that he had written a personal letter to the Islamic Republic's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 'I tend not to comment on any communications that I have with various leaders,' he said. But he claimed 'significant' progress negotiating with Iran over its dangerous nuclear ambitions that have already provoked alleged military responses from Israel. Ever the negotiator, Obama said 'the question now is are we going to be able to close this final gap so that they can reenter the international community, sanctions can be slowly reduced and we have verifiable, lock-tight assurances that they can't develop a nuclear weapon.' 'But there's still a big gap,' he conceded, 'We may not be able to get there.' He also acknowledged that Iran has troops stationed in and around Baghdad, inserting itself into the Iraqi conflict with ISIS. The majority-Shiite Iran sees the terror army as an adversary because it is largely made up of Sunni Muslims. 'We let them know, ""Don't mess with us. We're not here to mess with you. We're focused on our common enemy,"" Obama said. 'But there is no coordination or common battle plan and there will not be.'","President says he's to blame for Democrats' massive midterm losses but insists his economic record is solid and the US is better off with him in power .

"A tiny horse who suffers from a rare form of dwarfism has become an internet hit after his owner posted a video of him on Facebook. At just over 20 inches tall, Shammy is a third of the size of an average horse - but what he lacks in size he makes up for in personality. As a result the five-month-old horse has a 500-strong following on Facebook and his owner, Michele Puryear, has written a book about him. Scroll down for video . Hamming it up: Shammy, who suffers from a rare form of dwarfish, has become and internet stardom after his owner set him up a Facebook page and posted a video of him .

Cosying up: Ms Puryear looks rapturous as she snuggles into a content looking Shammy on their couch . Ms Puryear said: 'He truly is a one in a million, dwarf horses are always very loveable and mischievous but Shammy is more affectionate than most. 'He is almost like a dog, he would rather be with me than with a herd of horses or even with his mama sometimes.' 'He follows me around and runs in and out of the horse trailer - if he can find something to get into, he's going to get in to it.' When he's not causing trouble around Ms Puryear's farm in the U.S. state of Georgia, Shammy loves nothing more than a good cuddle. She said: 'When I'm here I can just spend my time sitting on the ground with him and he'll stay with me until I make him get up - he just loves attention. Almost famous: Shammy's antics inspired Ms Puryear to write a book about his adventures . Small stead: Because of Shammy's condition he is likely to develop arthritis and heart problems .

Feisty: Shammy is said to be mischievous, 'If he can find something to get into, he's going to get in to it' 'A lot of the time when I come home and get out of the car, he is stood there waiting at the gate and I have to stop what I'm doing and love him for a little while - he just can't resist.' Ms Puryear was surprised at how quickly Shammy became an online star, with his Facebook account getting 90 visitors within 30 days of being activated. She said: 'People were just falling in love with him right away. They all want to take him home or buy him - but of course I would never sell him. So cute: Shammy's owner normally breeds horses to sell but said she just 'couldn't with Shammy' 'He's the only baby I ever kept. I usually breed my babies and sell them but I just couldn't with Shammy.' Unfortunately Shammy's condition will inevitably lead to problems later on in life, such as arthritis and heart issues. Ms Puryear, who works in finance and insurance, said: 'He won't ever be like the other horses, but I want him to be pain-free. That's my hope for Shammy. 'At any time he could lay down in his sleep and pass.

"If you have trouble coping with a spider in your bath, be glad you don't live in the Xishuangbanna tropical rainforest in China. Scientists have recently identified 30 new species of arachnid in less than a square mile of the mysterious forest in the southern part of Yunnan. And they believe many more are yet to be discovered in the biodiversity hotspot - called Mengbanaxi in ancient times, meaning a 'miraculous utopia' and also known as 'the Kingdom of Tropical Fauna and Flora'. Scroll down for video . Scientists have recently identified 30 new species of spider in less than a square mile of a mysterious forest in the southern part of Yunnan. Above, one of the new species, Glebala aspera . Many more spider species are yet to be discovered in the biodiversity hotspot of Xishuangbanna, according to the team from the Institute of Zoology with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Above, Capsulia laciniosa . The spiders (including Cirrosus atrocaudatus, pictured) were found in an area called Huludao. Although it covers only about 200 hectares of Xishuangbanna, Huludao has yielded a collection of approximately 700 spider species . The team, from the Institute of Zoology with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, have warned that the find highlights how many undiscovered creatures are being lost to the world for ever, due to the destruction of the rainforests for logging and farming. Professor Shuqiang Li, of the academy, based in Beijing, said: 'The amazing biological diversity we have witnessed during our work on spiders in the area is perhaps only a part of what Xishuangbanna tropical rainforests hold.' It is one of the few places in China that still maintains large tracts of tropical rainforest, and Prof Li and colleagues have been using multiple collecting methods there since 2006. The spiders were found in an area called Huludao which, although covering only about 200 hectares of Xishuangbanna, has yielded a collection of approximately 700 spider species. The site of the spider find (above) was called Mengbanaxi in ancient times, meaning a 'miraculous utopia' and is now known as 'the Kingdom of Tropical Fauna and Flora' Prof Li said there are another 100 new ones to be published soon. The team has published findings on about 250 new spider species, with the 30 currently described in ZooKeys being a part of their ongoing work. Prof Li added: 'Studying the flora and fauna in biodiversity hotspots like these attests to the importance of their preservations, and gives a sad insight of what was lost with the destruction of forests elsewhere.' In the 1940s and 1950s, China's Xishuangbanna region was a remote tropical rainforest, China's only one. The team has published findings on about 250 new spider species, with the 30 currently described in ZooKeys being a part of their ongoing work. Above, Bathyphantes paracymbialis . Since then the government and people of Xishuangbanna have begun a completely devastating assault on the environment. Slash and burn agriculture, and wholesale destruction of the tropical rainforest, has lifted much of the region out of abject poverty, but at a serious cost. Today Xishuangbanna is a shadow of its former self. New highways, tea plantations, rubber tree plantations and sugar cane dominate the landscape. Rainforests once covered 14 per cent of the earth's land surface. Now they cover a mere 6 per cent and experts estimate the last remaining could be consumed in less than 40 years. Nearly half of the world's species of plants, animals and micro-organisms will be destroyed or severely threatened over the next quarter century due to the deforestation. A farmer watches the burning hillsides in China's Xishuangbanna region . It is estimated we are losing 137 plant, animal and insect species every single day, which amounts to 50,000 a year. As the rainforest species disappear, so do many possible cures for life-threatening diseases. Currently, 121 prescription drugs sold worldwide come from plant-derived sources. While 25 per cent of Western pharmaceuticals are derived from rainforest ingredients, less that 1 per cent of these tropical trees and plants have been tested by scientists.","Discovered in Xishuangbanna, known as 'the Kingdom of Tropical Fauna and Flora' in southern part of Yunnan .

"Families have been warned to arm themselves amid fears of more violent protests over the shooting of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson. Missouri is bracing itself for renewed demonstrations ahead of a grand jury verdict on whether to charge a white police officer over the 18-year-old's death in St Louis. Protesters are gathering in and around the city as they nervously await what many believe will be an inevitable no-indictment vote. The ruling was expected yesterday, but did not materialise. Online chatter from users claiming to be police officers and their supporters predicts furious clashes regardless of the outcome, with some users saying the force will be powerless to protect the public. Scroll down for video . Missouri is bracing itself for renewed violence ahead of a grand jury verdict on whether to charge a white police officer over the shooting of black teenager Michael Brown . From Boston to Los Angeles, police departments are bracing for demonstrations when the grand jury decides . One user called A Concerned Cop advised residents to take up arms to safeguard their families. Writing on the forum St Louis Cop Talk, the user said: 'If you do not have a gun, get one and get one soon. We will not be able to protect you or your family. 'It will be your responsibility to protect them. Our gutless commanders and politicians have neutered us. 'I'm serious, get a gun, get more than one, and keep one with you at all times.' Other posts label the protesters as 'terrorists', according to a report by Vocativ. The forum has since been taken down. Meanwhile, some users suggested asking the fire department for water hoses to protect the police from rioters. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard ahead of a grand jury decision on whether Darren Wilson (left) will be charged over the shooting of Michael Brown (right) In his executive order on Monday, Nixon (pictured) cited the 'possibility of expanded unrest' Supporters of the policeman who shot Michael Brown have launched a campaign to put up a billboard in the city backing the officer. The campaign was launched by a supporter from Tennessee last month and has already raised the $3,000 goal to erect the sign. Plans are for the billboard to read 'Pants Up, Don't Loot' - a phrase made popular by National Review in response to the chant 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot' recited by Brown's supporters. The campaign website says it intends to erect the sign in the 'heart of Florissant' where many of the violent protests have taken place. Although the $3,000 target has been reached, the billboard has not yet been purchased, it was noted by TPM Livewire. According to the campaign website: 'The funds collected from this campaign will be used to purchase this billboard for as long as possible. 'Whatever funds we receive will go directly to keeping the billboard campaign up as long as possible. 'If we come to an agreement with a company and can fund it for 3 months, 5 months, 7 months... we will.' An anonymous user who claimed he was a police officer wrote: 'We can't even hit our sticks on the ground.' The emergence of the forum comes after two Twitter accounts belonging to the Ku Klux Klan were taken over by hacker group Anonymous after the white supremacist group threatened protesters in Ferguson. Anonymous acted after the group distributed flyers threatening 'lethal force' against the protesters who have gathered around St Louis while they await what many believe will be a no-indictment vote. Anonymous has previously announced that Wilson will not be charged. Missouri's governor has re-activated the National Guard and declared a state of emergency in an effort to avoid more unrest. But when pressed further, he struggled to answer whether the buck stopped with him on any response to the protests. Asked by reporters if it was his overall responsibility, he gave the less-than convincing response: 'We're, um, you know, it a, you know, our goal here is to, is to, keep the peace and allow folks' voices to be heard. 'And in that balance, attempting, you know I am, using the resources we have to be predictable. ... I don't spend a tremendous amount of time personalizing this vis-a-vis me.' He was also vague when questioned on which official or agency was in command of the response, it was reported by ABC News. He said: 'Well, I mean, it a, clearly, I mean, I, I feel good about the, we worked hard, to establish unified command, to allied responsibilities and now with the additional assets provided by my order today, with the National Guard, you know, we have worked through a number of operational issues.' Unlike in August, when Governor Jay Nixon asked the troops to help quell the sometimes-violent protests that had occurred nightly following Brown's death, his latest move is pre-emptive, coming ahead of any decision on whether Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson will be indicted. There also are some operational differences this time. When Nixon last declared a state of emergency, he put the Missouri State Highway Patrol in charge of a unified local police command and later activated the National Guard to provide security around the command center. Nixon said the St Louis County Police Department would be in charge of security in Ferguson after the grand jury decision and would work with the Highway Patrol and St Louis city police as part of a unified command to 'protect civil rights and ensure public safety' in other jurisdictions. 'My hope and expectation is that peace will prevail,' Nixon said Monday. 'But we have a responsibility - I have a responsibility - to plan for any contingencies that might arise.' There is no specific date for a grand jury decision to be revealed and Nixon gave no indication that an announcement is imminent. But St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch has said that he expects the grand jury to reach a decision in mid-to-late November. The U.S. Justice Department, which is conducting a separate investigation, has not said when its work will be completed. The governor did not indicate how many National Guard troops would be mobilised, instead leaving it to the state adjutant general to determine. Nixon said the National Guard would be available to carry out any requests made through the Highway Patrol to 'protect life and property' and support local authorities. If the Guard is able to provide security at police and fire stations, then more police officers may be freed up to patrol the community, Nixon said. Preparation: Demonstrators lay on the ground in a mock death protest of the shooting of Brown. The area around St. Louis, Missouri, is preparing for the grand jury decision in the shooting death of Brown . St Louis Mayor Francis Slay said Monday that he supports Nixon's decision to activate the Guard. He said the Guard 'will be used in a secondary role' and could potentially be stationed at places such as shopping centers and government buildings. 'The way we view this, the Guard is not going to be confronting the protesters and will not be on (the) front line interacting directly with demonstrators,' Slay said. Before the shooting, Wilson spotted Brown and a friend walking in the middle of a street and told them to stop, but they did not. According to a St Louis Post-Dispatch report based on sources the newspaper did not identify, Wilson has told authorities he then realised Brown matched the description of a suspect in a theft minutes earlier at a convenience store. Wilson backed up his police vehicle and some sort of confrontation occurred before Brown was fatally shot. He was unarmed and some witnesses have said he had his hands up when he was killed. Brown's shooting stirred long-simmering racial tensions in Ferguson, where two-thirds of the residents are black, but the police force is almost entirely white. Rioting and looting a day after the shooting led police to respond to subsequent protests with a heavily armored presence that was widely criticized for continuing to escalate tensions. At times, protesters lobbed rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, who fired tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse crowds.","Users on police forum claim police will be powerless to protect the public .

"On a mission: A Tornado crewman heads out to attack IS targets . British airstrikes against Islamic State militants are being conducted by morale-sapped pilots who are using broken equipment, claims an RAF serviceman. The insider said RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus was being neglected, morale was poor and ground crews had been forced to eat humanitarian rations meant for Iraqis. In a strongly-worded letter it was said that there is no hospital at the base – even though there are daily operations involving live ammunition. In the letter to BBC’s Newsnight, the serviceman alleged that ‘the costs and quality of the catering and retail support are a disgrace’ and that crews there are led by a chain of command ‘so laced with budgetary fear … that no one knows what the plan is’. It was also claimed that because services were undertaken by private contractors, Cypriot cleaners at the base were being charged to the UK taxpayers at three times the annual cost of an airman’s salary. An RAF spokesman dismissed many of the claims, saying: ‘In our opinion this letter is factually inaccurate. In layman’s terms, it is completely full of holes.’ But a Ministry of Defence source confirmed that an incident in which ground crew had been given aid rations had taken place. During a recent visit to the base by an air vice-marshal, one sergeant from II Squadron complained about the quality of the food available to crews working overnight on Tornado jets. The officer was said to have been so disgusted by the cheese sandwiches offered as meals to the night shift, he broke into a pallet of rations intended for dropping to refugees in northern Iraq and handed it out. The serviceman’s letter added: ‘It was better than what we were feeding our airmen.’ Newsnight reported that due to their age, the battle to keep some of the eight Tornados at the base airworthy has required long hours of work by ground crews, particularly on the engines. On many days, just two or three of the jets are available for missions over Iraq. The Tornado, which has undergone numerous upgrades, has been in service with the RAF for more than 30 years. However, the MoD source insisted that the jet ‘continues to offer good serviceability and is meeting required tasking’. Many RAF personnel are said to be exhausted after years of continuous deployments. Although an MoD source said facilities at Akrotiri are comparable with RAF stations around the world, conditions are reported to be worse than those that personnel had experienced on operations in Afghanistan. Hot meals are only served during the day, with snacks provided at night. Scroll down for video . One insider said pilots were operating broken equipment and were forced to survive on aid rations.

Responding to suggestions that personnel are poorly fed, the MoD source said ‘crews were offered a small number of excess rations [a vegetarian curry] as a one-off gesture during a testing deployment’, and argued there was no question of the crews needing the humanitarian rations in order to be ‘adequately fed’. Shortly after operations began against Islamic State in September, the number of Tornado fighter bombers was increased from six to eight. Newsnight reported this increase was necessary in order to ensure there were always two aircraft available for bombing missions.

"Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson resigned from the force because of threats against his colleagues, his lawyer said on Sunday, as it emerged he will not receive any severance pay. Mr Wilson, 28, whom a grand jury chose not to indict in the shooting death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in the St Louis, Missouri, suburb on August 9, officially quit the force on Saturday. On Sunday, his lawyer, Neil Bruntrager, revealed he chose to resign after being made aware of threats that his fellow officers would be harmed if he stayed in the force. It comes as Ferguson Mayor James Knowles has announced that Mr Wilson will not receive further pay nor benefits following his resignation, which he deemed a 'personal', not official, matter. Speaking at a news conference, Mr Knowles added that the city is implementing a new scholarship scheme through which it hopes to recruit a higher number of African-American police officers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Resignation: Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson (pictured in grand jury evidence) resigned from the force because of threats against his colleagues, his lawyer said, as it emerged he will not receive severance pay . Shooting: Mr Wilson (pictured, left, in his police uniform), 28, whom a grand jury chose not to indict in the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown (right) in the St Louis, Missouri, suburb on August 9,  quit the force on Saturday . Mayor: It comes as Ferguson Mayor James Knowles (pictured) has announced that the white officer will not receive a severance package or benefits following his resignation, which he deemed a 'personal' matter . The scheme will aim to 'make the department more inclusive of the community', he said, adding that a police explorer program will also be introduced to schools in the area by 2015. On Monday, a grand jury decided not to indict Mr Wilson for shooting to death Brown, who is black, in a move that has sparked violent demonstrations across more than 170 American cities. The verdict, announced by St Louis Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, has also galvanized critics of the way police and the U.S. criminal justice system treat African-Americans and other minorities. Following the announcement, Mr Wilson, who maintains he shot Brown in self-defense, was placed on administrative leave from the police department. He was also put in seclusion. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Bruntrager said Ferguson's police chief, Thomas Jackson, had recently told Mr Wilson he had information suggesting other officers would be harmed if he stayed on the force. 'The information we had was that there would be actions targeting the Ferguson (police) department or buildings in Ferguson related to the police department,' he said. Protests: Speaking at a news conference, Mr Knowles added that the city is implementing a new scholarship scheme through which it hopes to recruit a higher number of African-American officers. Above, the grand jury's decision not to indict Mr Wilson in the shooting has sparked protests in Ferguson (pictured) and other cities . Refusing to move: A protester screams as he blocks traffic outside Ferguson police station on Saturday . Angry: A car sporting the now-famous phrase, 'Hands up, don't shoot!', drives through Ferguson on Saturday . 'When Darren was told that, he simply said, ""That's enough"", and it was time to resign.' During the news conference, Mr Knowles acknowledged that a number of 'egregious' threats had been made against Ferguson police, but he denied that the city asked the officer to leave the force. In a letter published by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Saturday, Mr Wilson said he had wanted to wait until after the grand jury's decision before deciding whether to quit. 'I, Darren Wilson, hereby resign my commission as a police officer with the City of Ferguson effective immediately. I have been told that my continues employment may put the residents and police officers of the City of Ferguson at risk, which is a circumstance that I cannot allow. 'For obvious reasons, I wanted to wait until the grand jury made their decision before I officially made my decision to resign. 'It was my hope to continue in police work, but the safety of other police officers and the community are of the paramount importance to me. 'It is my hope that my resignation will allow the community to heal. I would like to thank all of my supporters and fellow officers throughout this process.' Nevertheless, his departure was long anticipated because of the potential risks to his own safety and the deep rifts that have surfaced between police and the African-American community. 'For obvious reasons, I wanted to wait until the grand jury made their decision before I officially made my decision to resign,' Mr Wilson wrote in his letter of resignation. 'It was my hope to continue in police work, but the safety of other police officers and the community are of paramount importance to me.' He added: 'It is my hope that my resignation will allow the community to heal. I would like to thank all of my supporters and fellow officers throughout this process.' Some critics are now campaigning for Mr Jackson to resign as well to promote reconciliation in Ferguson, where most residents are black and the police force are mostly white. 'I think it's impossible for this community to move forward with him still in that role,' said St. Louis Alderman Antonio French on ABC's 'This Week'. But when asked during Sunday's news conference if there were any changes planned in the suburb's leadership, Mr Knowles said there were not. Speaking to the Associated Press earlier on Sunday, Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Mr Brown's family, said Mr Wilson's resignation was not a surprise. 'It was always believed that the police officer would do what was in his best interest, both personally and professionally,' Mr Crump said. Incident: Brown had been walking with a friend down the center of Canfield Drive when Wilson, passing in his patrol vehicle, told them to move to the sidewalk. The pair then had a scuffle at Wilson's car (pictured) Broken glass: In subsequent seconds, Wilson fired a shot that hit Brown in the right hand. When the teen ran, Wilson gave chase, before later opening fire. Above, broken glass from Wilson's patrol car window . Weapon: This gun, used to kill Brown, was released this week as part of the dump of grand jury evidence . 'We didn't believe he would be able to be effective for the Ferguson community nor the Ferguson Police Department because of the tragic circumstances that claimed the life of Michael Brown Jr.' He added that the family would pursue all legal avenues, including a potential wrongful death lawsuit, as well as a 'Michael Brown law' requiring police to wear body cameras to record incidents. But he said: ';Don't let that get confused with the fact that they really wanted the killer of their child to be held accountable.' Meanwhile, Mr Wilson's resignation meant little to more than 100 people who were protesting outside Ferguson's police headquarters on Saturday night. Two people were arrested, . Defensive: Following the announcement, Mr Wilson (speaking to ABC), who maintains he shot Brown in self-defense, was placed on administrative leave from the police department. However, he has now quit the force . An empty seat: On Thanksgiving Day, Michael Brown's relatives left a chair empty with a T-shirt reading, 'Gone too soon', slung over the back at the dinner table. Similar images were later posted online by protesters . One protester was pictured burning an American flag. By midnight, only around two dozen remained. Several shrugged their shoulders when asked what they thought about Mr Wilson's resignation, with protester Rick Campbell saying he didn't care, noting: 'I've been protesting out here since August.' Meanwhile, in Portland, 10 people were arrested on Saturday night after they 'laid down in the street and refused lawful orders to clear the roadway', according to the city's police. During the protest, Reverend Jesse Jackson gave a speech, in which he urged nonviolence and said the resignation of the officer was 'a step in the right direction', but that much still had to be done to achieve justice for the victim. Mr Wilson fatally shot Mr Brown in the middle of a Ferguson street after the two scuffled inside Wilson's police SUV. Some witnesses have said Mr Brown had his hands up when Mr Wilson shot him. But Mr Wilson told the grand jury that he feared for his life when the teenager hit him and reached for his gun. The U.S. Justice Department is conducting a civil rights investigation into the shooting, as well as separate investigation of police department practices. It remains unclear what the future holds for Mr Wilson, who has spent his adult life in police work and never wanted to do anything else, Mr Bruntrager said. 'In terms of what it (the resignation) means, it means at this point he doesn't have a paycheck,' said the lawyer. 'He has no income so he'll have to make some decisions pretty quickly.'","Darren Wilson, 28, resigned from Ferguson Police Department Saturday .

"One of Australia's most successful businesswomen says she fell into her dream job  by complete accident. Carrol Bradford was offering childcare services from her Brisbane home, when her sister begged her to 'step in' to look after her three Avon clients while she went on holiday. Eight years on, Carrol boasts a team of 500 staff across the country. A team who helped her turn over $1.5 million in makeup and skincare sales this year alone. 'I thought I'd try it myself as I needed the extra money and it just grew by word of mouth,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'At first all I wanted was to get a hundred dollars of orders filled, I never dreamed it would become this big.' Avon Empire: Carrol Bradford, who began selling Avon products as a favour eight years ago, made $1.5 million in product sales this year . Mrs Bradford, who had never travelled overseas before starting Avon, has since represented the Australian and New Zealand arms of the company at leadership events in Bangkok and Singapore. 'For me, that was a real highlight I think, I'd not been anywhere before,' she said. She says a lot of her work has come through referrals and  her online store - and through a lot of hard work. 'We still do get-togethers at people's homes but its really not just the little lady coming to the front door anymore.' Carrol Bradford had never been overseas before she started travelling to represent Avon Australia at industry events in Bangkok and Singapore. This year, she made $1.5 million in sales . Avon queen Carrol Bradford and some of her  dream team . With her success,Mrs Bradford has even been able to convince her husband Greg to become an 'Avon Man'. When she ended up sick in hospital one day, she had to call on Greg, a full time bricklayer, to make her deliveries for her. And he's decided to stay on, delivering products to customers in their Brisbane area on Saturdays. He's now earning the equivalent of his salary as an Avon salesman. 'He's my Mr Avon,' says Bradford. 'The ladies at the nursing home just love him; he gets offered so many more scones and cups of tea than I ever have - he's actually put on a bit of weight!' Does he cop a hard time from colleagues in the construction industry? 'No, well I don't think he tells everyone -  but those that do know think its pretty clever really. And Avon is a lot more than just women's make-up these days,' says Mrs Bradford. 'Avon Man' Greg Bradford earns the same amount of money as his full time bricklaying job by selling Avon products part-time . Carrol, on one of her Avon rounds in Brisbane, now has a team of 500 Avon representatives from across the country . Bradford says the biggest sellers are skincare products like cleansers and night creams, but that the men's range also does well. Her recipe for success? 'Work hard and look after your customers,' says Mrs Bradford. 'It's true that you only get out what you put in and for me that meant working really hard at it, especially starting out. I set small goals for myself at first, then bigger ones, then bigger ones.' 'The other thing is to know your products: I use all the products and love them and this comes across.' A lot also depends on having a good team and Carrol Bradford says hers is amazing. So what's next for the Bradfords? Carrol says she and Greg hope to retire in a couple of years and go travelling. 'But for now, I'm still trying to grow. My team's been number one in Australia for three years running and I'd like it to be 4 years running,' says Mrs Bradford. 'I hope to get to $1.6 million this year. I have to do a little but better than last year don't I?'

"The Top Gear team tried to burn their cars as they fled Argentina after being attacked by protesters because it would give the footage 'dramatic effect', it has been claimed. Jeremy Clarkson and his film crew made a dramatic exit from Argentina this summer after being attacked over a perceived slur on the Falklands war, which the outspoken presenter described as the 'scariest thing I have ever been involved in.' Now Argentine police have published a report claiming that Clarkson, along with colleagues Richard Hammond and James May, attempted to torch their cars while fleeing for the Chilean border. Scroll down for video . An Argentine police report claims that Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, tried to set fire to their cars as they fled the country this summer (pictured after the attack) The Argentinian ambassador to the UK claims the blaze would have been used 'for dramatic effect' by the BBC  in their footage of the attack (pictured, damage done to the team's cars) The Argentinian ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, claims the blaze would have been used 'for dramatic effect' by the BBC. Angry locals attacked the TV crew after residents spotted that Clarkson's car had the number plate 'H982 FLK', which was seen to be a reference to the Falklands War of 1982. In the police report, seen by The Independent, officers document and attack on the presenters as the team drove away from their hotel in the southern ski resort of Tierra del Fuego. According to the report, a lorry 'started moving towards the road in such a way as to bring about a collision with the Top Gear crew's first vehicle'. The report says officers, who had mounted an operation to try to get the team out of the country safely, stopped the truck, but a Top Gear cameraman was injured by shattered glass. Clarkson's Porsche 928, now with the numberplate H1 VAE, escaped unharmed along with Richard Hammond's Lotus Esprit and James May's Ford Mustang. However, once the trio reached the nearby San Pablo road, they stopped. The Top Gear team claim their priority was to abandon the cars and escape, but Argentine police say the presenters tried to set the vehicles alight. Clarkson and his team were attacked after locals spotted this number plate, which was thought to be a reference to the Falklands war . In a letter to the chair of the BBC trust, Ms Castro brands the decision to burn the cars 'alarming and illegal', adding: 'Why would the team possibly want to burn such expensive BBC property?' The cars were eventually impounded by the police, who then escorted the presenters out Argentina and into Chile via another route. The fresh allegations were revealed the day after Richard Hammond spoke to chat show host Alan Carr about the attack. He said the Argentinians had behaved 'like animals' by throwing rocks at their cars and shattering the windows, and had 'scared the c*** out of the crew'. He also denied that the stunt had been deliberate, saying the crew had only realised the connection when someone pointed it out to them on Twitter. He added: 'That's when we realised we had to do something about it. 'That's kind of why we've all got our hands up saying ""hang on a minute - the idea that we'd planned that is pretty much impossible and certainly isn't true""'. 'We didn't look at the plates. I've never looked at a number plate that we've used on a car for a special. Not with that kind of cynical outlook. 'You just get the car you want. There were only two of those 928 GTs for sale in the UK at the time - one of which was the one that we got.' A BBC spokesman said: ‘We absolutely refute the suggestion the Top Gear team intended to set fire to the vehicles.’","Crew were attacked over number plate thought to reference Falklands War .

"Hong Kong's leader Leung Chun-ying has claimed that 'external forces' are behind the violent protests that have rocked the territory. Chief Executive Leung said in a televised statement yesterday that he believes foreign powers are involved in the unrest, echoing accusations made by China. But the students behind the pro-democracy protests firmly denied the claim, saying that Leung was 'just making it up'. Scroll down for video . Hong Kong's leader Leung Chun-ying has claimed that 'external forces' are behind the violent protests that have rocked the country . His claim echoes statements made by China, who also say foreign powers are involved in the unrest . Stand off: The protests continued last night, as protesters and police geared up for another night of clashes . Sit in: Thousands of student demonstrators have organised peaceful protests in the centre of Hong Kong, but as night falls this has turned to violence over the last three-and-a-half weeks . Speaking in a televised interview, Leung said: 'There is obviously participation by people, organisations from outside of Hong Kong.' He added that foreign actors came from 'different countries in different parts of the world', but did not specify where. China's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei repeated the claims today. He said: 'Everybody has seen the fact that some people and some forces from the outside are indeed making attempts at interfering in Hong Kong's affairs in order to affect Hong Kong's development, and the fact that they have gone so far as to encourage, instigate and support illegal activities.' But the Hong Kong Federation of Students, backing the tens of thousands of demonstrators who have been occupying parts of central Hong Kong for more than three weeks, said Leung and China were 'just making it up'. Secretary general Alex Chow said: 'He's the chief executive, he's an accountable official. If he's putting forward these accusations, then we hope he also puts forward the evidence. But he shouldn't just say that foreign powers are meddling without evidence.' The protesters, who are mainly students, are pushing for a greater say in choosing the territory's leader in their first direct election, promised by China for 2017. They oppose Beijing's ruling that all people who intend to run have to be screened by Chinese officials first.

Leung's statement comes just before his government is scheduled to hold talks with student leaders on Tuesday. However, a resolution is unlikely as the Chief Executive has already said that Beijing is not going to give in to the students' demands. Last night was largely peaceful, however the two nights before saw violent clashes and running battles between protesters and the police. The police tried to drive away the students during the night, only to seem them regroup and reoccupy the centre of the city. This has become an almost daily pattern, as the police make little progress on forcing the group to disperse. A 23-year-old demonstrator was arrested yesterday, the first person suspected of inciting protests online. The unnamed protester 'incited others on an online forum to join the unlawful assembly in Mong Kok, to charge at police and to paralyze the railways', police spokesman Steve Hui said. The arrest raised concerns among human rights activists that police have so far refused to disclose what the suspect's posts say or who revealed the man's identity and location to investigators. Maya Wang, a China researcher with Human Rights Watch, said: 'There clearly are some concerns about the impacts it could have on free speech. 'The police would have to explain what the post actually says and how it contravenes the law.'

"A small town in Queensland experienced the bewildering force of nature on Thursday night as an enormous dust storm swept through and engulfed the area in darkness. Clouds of dirt engulfed the town of Bedourie, in Queensland's south-west, at about 6.30pm, bringing with it a thick, dusty night for more than 90 minutes. Residents of the remote outback town said that they had never seen anything like it, as incredible images of the dust storm are revealed. Bedourie, which borders the Simpson Desert, has a population of only 110 people, with the town's name literally translates to 'dust storm' in the local indigenous language . The stunning phenomena is captured in the photographs as powerful winds pick up debris of dirt and dust and push them ahead of an approaching storm. Dust storms are not uncommon in the area, and are caused in part by the heat of Western Australia which results in thunderstorms forming very high above the ground. 'Because of this, any rain can evaporate before it hits the ground. As the atmosphere cools with this evaporating rain, it sinks compared to the surrounding hot air, and very strong winds speeds become much more likely,' Meteorologist Tony Auden told Yahoo.

The Packers led 42-0 at half-time with Rodgers having twice connected on touchdown passes to wide receiver Jordy Nelson, who finished the game with 152 yards on six receptions. After a one-yard pass to Brandon Bostick and a four-yarder to Andrew Quarless in the first quarter, Rodgers connected with Nelson twice in the second. Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (12) celebrates as they easily beat the Chicago Bears . Rodgers astonishingly became only the second quarterback to throw six touchdowns in a half . Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler (6) congratulates Rodgers (12) talk after the rout . He found his favoured receiver open but with some ground to cover for a 73-yard score and then produced a magnificent trademark pass on the run to find Nelson with a 40-yard pass into the end zone. After a short pass to running back Eddie Lacy, who raced through the Bears defense, made it 35-0, Rodgers saved the most spectacular for last with a superb 18-yard effort to Randall Cobb, who produced a magnificent catch in the corner. The 2010 Super Bowl winner and MVP was perfectly placed to join seven other quarterbacks to throw a record seven touchdowns in a game and had a real opportunity to become the first to reach eight against a demoralised Bears defense. But Packers head coach Mike McCarthy took his starting quarterback out of the game early in the third quarter, no doubt to protect him from the possibility of injury, handing back-up Matt Flynn the reins.

"A judge praised the 'brave' mother who told the police her son had gone to Syria 'to do jihad' as he jailed two childhood friends for more than 12 years for joining an Al-Qaeda linked group. Mohammed Nahin Ahmed and Yusuf Zubair Sarwar, both 22, from Birmingham, fled to the war-torn country in May last year after contacting Islamic extremists online. Today Sarwar's mother was given credit for alerting the authorities after her son left a note saying he was going to Syria and told her the Taliban and Al Qaeda 'are not bad'. Jailed: Best friends Nahin Ahmed (left) and Yusuf Zubair Sarwar, both 22, fled Britain for Syria to 'do jihad'. They took pictures of themselves with guns that police found in their luggage . Woolwich Crown Court heard the pair ordered books Islam For Dummies, The Koran For Dummies and Arabic For Dummies from Amazon ahead of their trip. Ahmed also told his childhood friend Sarwar: 'I cannot tell anyone I'm going to do jihad. Lol. I'll get arrested' just before they left Birmingham and joined rebels in Aleppo. The men were arrested on their return to the UK in January and pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorism acts contrary to Section 5 of the Terrorism Act. They were sentenced at Woolwich Crown Court in London today to 12 years and eight months in prison with an extended licence period of five years. Sarwar left a scribbled letter for his mother when he fled for Syria, but she went to the police who intercepted him and his friend Ahmed when they flew back to Britain eight months later. It read: 'Make sure you don't get any authority involved its (sic) a kuffar (infidel) government. 'I will try to intercede for you but don't rely on my intercession for if Allah allows me to intercede make sure to perfect yourselfs (sic). 'Make sure to keep me in your dua (prayers) as I am doing the best deed in Allahs eyes in'shaa' Allah. 'I will be going to Sumya (Syria) Ash sham which I will help the oppressed and fight Allahs enemies there. 'Taliban, Al Quada (sic) etc are not bad the West portrays them as bad. 'The group I will be joining is Kataib Al Muhajireen which is part of Al Nusra. In 'shaa' Allah . 'WE WOULD STAND UP AND NEVER WOULD LET ALLAHS RELIGION BE DEMONISED' Judge Michael Topolski QC said: 'They willingly, enthusiastically and with a great deal of purpose, persistence and determination embarked on a course intended to commit acts of terrorism.' After eight months fighting in Syria they were arrested on their return to Heathrow Airport in January because their worried families  tipped off counter-terrorism detectives. Before he left Sarwar had left a note for his mother arguing going 'to do jihad' in Syria was 'doing the best deed in Allah's eyes' and said the Taliban and Al Qaeda 'are not bad', so she went to the police. The judge said they believed in 'violent Islamist extremism' and praised the 'extraordinarily brave' mother who reported her  son to the police. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: 'Without the mother's actions, the police would not have been in a position to be waiting for the men on their return.' The judge said they had made a careful plan 'to join the ranks of the Islamist forces', adding 'before travelling, you both went to some trouble to fabricate cover-stories'. The judge said both men 'intended to be martyred on the battlefield in Syria' and plotted 'to attack Assad's forces, with the obvious risk that these intended attacks may have resulted in both military and civilian losses'. He also discussed a note written from Sarwar to his mother, which hailed the Taliban. 'Its contents provide an insight into the true purpose of your journey. 'This was not a spontaneous response to travel to a humanitarian crisis. Without any doubt, it shows you were travelling to Syria intent on jihad'. Yusuf Zubair Sarwar  (left) and Mohammed Nahin Ahmed, both 22, from Birmingham, fled to the war-torn country in May last year after contacting Islamic extremists online . Reference books: The pair bought Islam for Dummies, The Koran for dummies and Arabic for Dummies from Amazon ahead of their Syria trip, where they spent eight months fighting in Aleppo . He said the sentences were designed to 'punish, deter and incapacitate' and 'both of these defendants are fundamentalists who became interested in and then deeply committed to violent extremism'. He said he could not be sure the defendants planned to launch attacks in Britain, but noted 'the retention of the disk, containing detailed instructions of how to make an IED, is a deeply disturbing feature'. He handed both men a jail term of 12 years and 8 months, to be followed by five years on extended license. They will be also be subject to counter-terror notification requirements for 30 years. The court heard the men fled to Syria claiming it was a university trip elsewhere but after returning to Britain they told officers they had been doing humanitarian work but a camera containing 'thousands' of images, including some of them posing with guns on the front line, was found in their luggage. Traces of 'military-grade explosives', including TNT and nitro-glycerine were on the men's clothes and trainers. Sarwar's family reported him missing to police in May last year after they found a hand-written letter from him in which said he had left to join a terrorist group called Kataib al Muhajireen (KaM) - later renamed Kateeba al-Kawthar - 'to do jihad'. Family: Sarwar left a scribbled letter for his mother when he fled for Syria, but she went to the police who intercepted him and his friend Ahmed when they flew back to Britain eight months later . Ruse: The pair said they were travelling to Turkey as part of a two-week trip organised by Birmingham City University (pictured at Heathrow) but they then went on to Syria . Officers also found social media and email conversations between the pair and Islamic extremists. Over Skype, Ahmed talked to a Swedish national who was fighting with KaM. He told the fighter: 'I come to join KaM,' to which the Swede replies: 'Inshallah (God willing)'. Ahmed later asked a Danish Islamic extremist: 'Would the brothers in Yemen accept me?' The families of both men had put pressure on them to return to the UK once they discovered where they were. Days earlier he had told his family he was travelling to Turkey as part of a two-week trip organised by Birmingham City University, where he was a part-time computer science student. It prompted a search of the men's homes, which revealed an online conversation between Ahmed and a Swedish national fighting with the KaM, during which Ahmed said he wanted to join the terrorist group. West Midlands Police said the men showed the mind-set to go and join the jihad in Syria, before carrying out research, buying equipment, and finally travelling their via Turkey. Ahmed, who was born in Bangladesh, moved to Britain as a child, while Sarwar, who is of Pakistani descent, was born in Britain. An initial search of their homes revealed images of Islamic propaganda on both of their computers, including images of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) flags, shaheed (martyr) literature and several texts which are linked to the jihadi mindset.","Mohammed Nahin Ahmed and Yusuf Zubair Sarwar admit terror offence .

"A tough fortnight for the Dallas Cowboys ended in the best possible way on Sunday, with a convincing win over the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley. After two straight defeats by Washington and Arizona, injury problems for quarterback Tony Romo and suggestions that a number of players ‘missed curfew’ on Friday, the Cowboys were back to winning ways. Dallas’ big players all showed up in London to lead them to a dominant 31-17 victory over Jacksonville in the third and final International Series contest this season. VIDEO Scroll down for Tony Romo: We had to win this game, we came out with great energy .

Dez Bryant (no 88) holds on tight as he gets a battering after scoring a first half touchdown for the Dallas Cowboys at Wembley . The Cowboys wide receiver celebrates in style with team-mate Frederick Travis after scoring a touchdown against the Jaguars . A banged up Romo, who missed the week-nine loss to Arizona, enjoyed excellent protection from his formidable offensive line as he threw for 246 yards and three touchdowns. ‘Tony played a really good game,’ head coach Jason Garrett said. ‘He saw the field well and took the opportunity to throw the ball down the field. He didn’t look like he had any physical restrictions.’ Romo added: ‘I’m just sore, but it’s always uncomfortable when you get hit. It’s part of playing football and everyone goes through that. I’m a little bang up, but a lot of guys are. ‘We had to win this game and came out with great energy and executed really well.’ Running back DeMarco Murray continued his strong season with yet another 100-yard rushing game while wide receiver Dez Bryant racked up 158 yards and two touchdowns. It was a victory that ended a two-game losing streak for Dallas and kept up the pressure on NFC East leaders Philadelphia having relinquished control of that division. If the Cowboys are serious about their play-off hopes, this was a game they could barely afford to lose against a Jacksonville team who have won just once this season. Garrett said: ‘The big challenge is to focus on the task in hand regardless of what happened the previous week. ‘I thought we did a good job of that and had the right approach, mentality and mindset and it reflected in our performance today.’ Denard Robinson’s 32-yard touchdown run for the Jaguars midway through the first quarter would have had the Cowboys sideline anxiously biting their nails at the prospect of a third straight defeat. But once the tide turned in Dallas’ favour, it never looked like shifting back again.

Cowboys wide receiver Devin Street (right) makes a catch under pressure from a Jaguars player as his team looks on from the touchline . Jacksonville’s promising start was undone by a costly mistake on special teams when Ace Sanders made a mess of his punt return. Sanders dropped the ball on his six-yard line, and Dallas recovered in excellent field position. On 3rd and Goal, Romo took his time and rolled right before finding a wide-open tight end Jason Witten in the end zone. Once Romo and Co settled down and found their groove, the Jags defense couldn’t stop them. Bryant helped himself to a pair of touchdowns in the first half, the first time he has recorded multiple scores this season. The first came on a 35-yard pass from Romo with 7:01 remaining in the second quarter, but the second was even bigger. With 19 seconds to play in the first half, Bryant caught a deep pass from Romo and bounced off tackles before marching all the way to the end zone for a 68-yard reception. It gave Dallas a 24-7 half-time lead, and it was an advantage that Jacksonville never threatened to close. Joseph Randle throws himself over an opponent to score a touchdown .

Cowboys running back Joseph Randle hammered another nail in the Jags coffin early in the third period as he scored on a 40-yard touchdown run with his first rush of the game. Jacksonville’s desperation was best demonstrated when they attempted to run the ball on 4th and 1 deep in their own territory and came up short. As was the case last year against the San Francisco 49ers, the Jags were simply outplayed on the night by a better team. Rookie quarterback Blake Bortles threw for 290 yards but no touchdowns. He almost went a game without throwing an interception until he threw straight into the open arms of Cowboys linebacker Bruce Carter in the fourth period taking his total for the season to 14. Jacksonville will return to British shores once again in 2015 to take on the Buffalo Bills and hope for better luck them. Robinson’s second touchdown run of night late in the fourth quarter gave the scoreboard a bit more respectability for the Jags. With just over six minutes to play and fans heading for an early exit, Romo took a seat on the bench as Dallas’ backup quarterback Brandon Weeden stepped in for the final few plays. The Cowboys know that tougher tests await them following their bye week, including two games against division rivals Philadelphia. A win against the Jaguars was all that mattered here, though, and it was a job well done.

"Demonstrators started a seven-day march from Ferguson to the Missouri governor's mansion in Jefferson City this morning to protest the grand jury decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Crowds gathered for a prayer service before driving to the site where Brown was killed then peacefully walking through the streets singing, stopping occasionally to stage 'die-ins'. Meanwhile dozens of protesters stormed in department stores, streets and parking lots chanting 'black lives matter'. The 120-mile march to Gov Jay Nixon's property in Jefferson City will take seven days and was organized by the NAACP. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Journey for justice: Demonstrators start a seven-day march from Ferguson to the Missouri governor's mansion in Jefferson City to protest the grand jury decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson . Effort: Hundreds are expected to join as they take on the 120-mile route, covering 10 miles every day. A group walk past a store front burnt during the violence . 'Don't shoot': Many put their hands-up, a gesture that has dominated protests around the country since the August shooting . Leading figure: NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks (centre) joins the marchers from Canfield . Die-ins: Demonstrators have staged a second day of die-ins across Ferguson to shut down businesses . Organizers say the purpose is to call for new leadership in the Ferguson police department and for police reforms in the St Louis suburb and throughout the U.S. Each evening along the route, marchers will participate in what they call 'teach-ins' and rallies. Organizers say people are welcome to join in as they please. Protesters upset by the grand jury's decision not to indict the Ferguson, Missouri, officer who killed 18-year-old Michael Brown have disrupted shopping in suburban St Louis for the second straight day. Fast food restaurant Buffalo Wild Wings was forced to close after dozens of people lay in the front court with their fists in the air, chanting 'no justice, no wings'. They marched through a Trader Joe's store in Brentwood, about 10 miles south of Ferguson, at around noon and later made their way through Saks. After leaving they briefly blocked Eager Road near Interstate 170. On Friday, three St Louis-area malls were briefly shut down due to demonstrations. Protest organizers planned to meet later Saturday to consider other plans for the coming days. As the march began, Gov Nixon called for the state legislature to meet and discus 'critical funding' following violent protests in the aftermath of the shooting of Michael Brown. According to CNN, $4million is currently set aside every year for the state's National Guard response, but it is unclear how much money he is seeking. In Chicago, Rev. Jesse Jackson joined a road blocking protest on Saturday and urged federal authorities to investigate the Ferguson shooting. He then joined a similar demonstration in Portland, Oregon, 2,120 miles away. According to The Oregonian, Jackson said that even though Portland is overwhelmingly white, it shares an ugly trait with Ferguson. 'Blacks are profiled and arrested disproportionately to the larger population,' he said. Hundreds of people interrupted holiday shopping at major retailers around the country to protest a grand jury's decision not to indict the officer who fatally shot the 18-year-old protesters dubbed the day 'Brown Friday' or 'Blackout Black Friday'. The route: Protesters joining the march will cover more than 120 miles in seven days . Start: The march began at Canfield Drive in Ferguson - where Michael Brown was shot - on Saturday and will go through various Missouri communities until they reach Jefferson City . Emotional: Emotions were running high at the service before driving to the site where Michael Brown died . Prayer service: Members of the NAACP held hands with marchers in prayer before heading out to walk . The congregation sang hymns and heard speeches before starting on the 120-mile trek to Jefferson City . Numerous storefronts in the Ferguson area still have their windows covered with plywood after the looting and violence in the immediate aftermath of the grand jury announcement Monday. But many merchants added spray-painted messages indicating that they were open ahead of Small Business Saturday. In San Francisco crowds used hammers to smash the windows of stores in the city's touristy Union Square. Demonstrators temporarily shut down three large malls in suburban St. Louis on one of the busiest shopping days of the year and then marched in front of the Ferguson police department. Several stores lowered their security doors or locked entrances as at least 200 protesters sprawled onto the floor while chanting, 'Stop shopping and join the movement,' at the Galleria mall in Richmond Heights a few miles south of Ferguson, Missouri, where Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown, who was unarmed, in August. The action prompted authorities to close the mall for about an hour Friday afternoon, while a similar protest of about 50 people had the same effect at West County Mall in nearby Des Peres. End point: After the seven-day march, the protesters will end at Governor Jay Nixon's mansion in Jefferson City . Chanting: Crowds chanted 'black lives matter' and 'don't shoot' in a St Louis mall for the second day running . Disruption: They took drums to beat as they slowly made their way through on Small Business Da . 'Hands up': The crowds made reference to the fact that Michael Brown allegedly died with his hands up . And several dozen demonstrators led to a temporary closure of the Chesterfield Mall. Later on Friday night, a group of about 100 protesters marched down West Florissant Avenue Florissant in front of the city's police and fire departments chanting, blocking traffic and stopping in front of some businesses. 'I served my country. I spent four years in the Army, and I feel like that's not what I served my country for,' said Ebonie Tyse, 26, of St. Louis. 'I served my country for justice for everyone. Not because of what color, what age, what gender or anything,' she said. Fifteen people were arrested, according to Missouri Department of Public Safety spokesman Mike O'Connell. He said charges would include peace disturbance and impeding the flow of traffic, and two people would be charged with resisting arrest and one with assault. Marching: Police trailed the group as they moved through the city chanting and lying on the ground . The peaceful protest is one of many across the US following the grand jury's refusal to indict Officer Wilson . Protesters in Seattle clashed with authorities and police said they used pepper spray against demonstrators and claimed that some demonstrators were throwing flares. At least five people were arrested, according to authorities. Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., attended a prayer vigil Friday night in Miami Gardens, Florida. He met with Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, whose 17-year-old son Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012 by a neighborhood watch volunteer. Tracy Martin told Miami television station WFOR he offered Michael Brown Sr. encouragement and told him 'God has his hands on the situation, and he's gonna be OK.' The vigil was part of the annual Gospel Explosion Concert hosted by rapper Flo Rida. The U.S. Justice Department has its own investigation into possible civil rights violations that could result in federal charges for Wilson, but investigators would need to satisfy a rigorous standard of proof. The federal agency also has launched a broad investigation into the Ferguson Police Department.

"Pete Siebold, 43, escaped with just an injured shoulder when the Virgin Galactic spacecraft broke apart mid-flight and crashed in the Mojave desert . Investigators  are trying to piece together how SpaceShipTwo's surviving pilot  managed to escape the rocket as it disintegrated around him and parachute to the ground from an altitude virtually devoid of oxygen. Pete Siebold, 43, sustained just an injured shoulder when the Virgin Galactic spacecraft broke apart mid-flight and crashed in the Mojave desert last Friday, killing co-pilot Michael Alsbury, 39. Christopher Hart, acting chairman for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that is leading the crash investigation, said Mr Siebold did not exit through the cockpit's escape hatch. 'We know it wasn't through there, so how did this pilot get out?' he said. Mr Siebold is being treated in hospital and is yet to speak to investigators. It has also been revealed that a 'human-factors' expert will join the investigation  to study why the Mr Alsbury prematurely unlocked a pivoting tail section of the ship during a test flight. The untimely engagement of the tail mechanism - designed to slow the vehicle's descent into the atmosphere from space - have emerged as a main thrust of the inquiry into the crash. It raises the prospect of human error as a cause for the crash, though investigators say it is too early to make any firm determination. 'We know already from having the lever move from lock to unlock that we need to get a human-factors person in here,' said Mr Hart. 'The question then is why did that happen when it happened?' Investigators have yet to determine whether releasing the tail mechanism too early caused or contributed to the crash of the space plane near the Mojave Air and Space Port, about 95 miles  north of Los Angeles. The suborbital rocket vehicle dubbed SpaceShipTwo broke into pieces shortly after it separated from the special jet plane that carries it aloft for its high-altitude launches. The crash, which unfolded without SpaceShipTwo catching fire or exploding in flames, came on its fourth powered test flight, the first since January. Video footage from the cockpit shows Mr Alsbury releasing a lever to unlock the twin-tail section eight seconds after SpaceShipTwo's engine ignited. Scroll down for video . Investigators have yet to determine whether releasing the tail mechanism too early caused or contributed to the crash of the space plane near the Mojave Air and Space Port, about 95 miles north of Los Angeles . Michael Alsbury, 39, was killed when the Virgin Galactic spacecraft broke apart mid-flight and crashed . Two seconds later the tail, which did not have sufficient aerodynamic pressure to hold it in place, began to pivot upward, a maneuver designed to increase drag for atmospheric re-entry. SpaceShipTwo, developed by the fledgling space tourism company of billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson, was designed to carry wealthy passengers on short rides into space. Virgin Galactic was planning to begin offering its first flights to paying customers next spring. Mr Hart told a news conference  that investigators had determined SpaceShipTwo's tail system was supposed to have been released for deployment as the craft was traveling about 1.4 times the speed of sound. These images show the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rocket separating from the carrier aircraft, left, and then disintegrating, right, during a test flight on Friday . Instead, the tail section began pivoting when the vehicle was flying at Mach 1, the speed of sound. 'I'm not stating that this is the cause of the mishap. We have months and months of investigation to determine what the cause was,' Mr Hart said. Asked if pilot error was a possible factor, Mr Hart said: 'We are looking at all of these issues to determine what was the root cause of this mishap ... including that possibility.' Also unclear was exactly how the tail mechanism began to rotate once it was unlocked, since that maneuver requires a separate pilot command that was never given, Mr Hart said. This raised questions about whether the craft's position in the air and its speed somehow enabled the tail section to swing free on its own. The spacecraft was supposed to 'feather' when it reached its maximum altitude at 360,000ft but the device was launched early just seconds after detaching from the launch craft . The untimely engagement of the tail mechanism - designed to slow the vehicle's descent into the atmosphere from space - and the possibility that pilot error was to blame, have emerged as a main thrust of the inquiry .","Pete Siebold, 43, escaped from the spacecraft and parachuted to safety .

"Germany boss Joachim Low has warned his players they have gone from hunter to prey since winning the World Cup. Low's men head into Euro 2016 battle with the Republic of Ireland in Gelsenkirchen on Tuesday evening having surrendered a 33-game unbeaten running in qualifiers with a 2-0 defeat in Poland on Saturday, a result which followed a friendly loss to Argentina and a narrow Group D victory over Scotland. But while the manager insists the weight of success is not a burden for his team, he admits the label does serve to inspire whoever they come up against. Joachim Low's German side have posted some average results since their World Cup victory in Brazil . Low said: 'The difficulties we are experiencing at the moment are of a type that we have experienced many times before. But generally speaking, I don't think the position now is anymore difficult than it's always been. 'We used to be the hunter; now we are the prey. We know that teams like Scotland will play with incredible motivation against us - but that was true even after [the World Cup in] 2010 and [Euro] 2012. 'We know the situation, we know how to get by it, but it's no different now than it used to be.' Germany remain overwhelming favourites to top the group and will expect to right the wrongs of Warsaw in comprehensive style against an Ireland team which has collected maximum points from a trip to Georgia and a 7-0 demolition of Gibraltar. Low said: 'If you ask me what is the mood like now, fury is the wrong word, anger is the wrong word. But what you can feel is some kind of determination, that we really badly want these three points against Ireland. 'But there is no incredible disappointment in the team. That would be wrong to say. 'We have seen both the Irish games and have analysed them, and we can expect some sort of copy of Poland. There's nothing new to us. The Irish are good fighters, they have commitment and fantastic fighting spirit, and they know how to defend. 'They are a very well organised team, but at the same time, they have excellent players, like Robbie Keane, who is very experienced and has an eye for goal, Aiden McGeady, James McClean and other players who come from the wings and are very good at dribbling around their opponents. 'Like Poland, they are very fast on the counter, coming from the wings and putting dangerous crosses in. 'They come to Germany with self-confidence and with three teams being able to qualify from this group, they are in with a more than reasonable chance of actually making it to France.' Schalke striker Julian Draxler is set to be named in Low's starting line-up to face the Republic of Ireland . Low insisted he would not make too many changes to his team, although Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder Christoph Kramer will be missing through illness with Schalke's Julian Draxler expected to be drafted in on his home ground after himself shaking off a virus. Draxler said: 'We want people to forget the defeat against Poland. As a footballer, you want to win every game. 'The last thing you do is sit down looking at the table and try to pre-conceive, 'We can afford to lose this one, we can afford to lose that one and still make it'. 'If you are a professional player, you want to win everything, so we feel we need to prove to our fans we can still win games. 'We are reigning world champions. Even if we lost a game, we still are title-holders and we are all fully there. We want to show the world that we would like to reach unbeatable status as quickly as possible.' Low has cited Everton winger Aiden McGeady as one of the Republic of Ireland's main attacking threats . Much of the concern in Germany over the current team surrounds the full-backs with Philipp Lahm's international retirement in particular leaving a gaping hole at the back, and youngsters Erik Durm and Antonio Rudiger have found themselves under intense scrutiny. But Low said: 'Philipp Lahm played in the position for many, many years and he showed world class both on the right and on the left. 'It was obvious it would be difficult to replace somebody like him on a one-to-one basis. That is a fantasy.'","Loss to Poland ended 33-game unbeaten run in qualifiers for Low's men .

"Lewis Hamilton pipped title rival and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg by just seven thousandths of a second after a nail-biting qualifying session for the Singapore Grand Prix. For once this season there were drivers other than the Mercedes duo in the hunt for top spot on the grid under the lights of the Marina Bay Street Circuit. Yet come the conclusion it was Mercedes - and Hamilton in particular - who again just had the edge, with the Briton claiming back-to-back poles after starting out front in the last race in Italy. Now click here to read the full report. Host commentator . Thank you for your company today. Be sure to join us for what promises to be a spectacular race, and in the meantime read our developing report from qualifying. A brilliant radio exchange ensued Hamilton's pole lap. Rosberg's engineer: ""Hamilton has beaten you by seven thousandths of a second"" Rosberg: ""Damn it!"" And another stellar effort from Ricciardo to be just a tenth shy of the Mercedes drivers. Singapore Grand Prix Grid 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Ricciardo; 4 Vettel; 5 Alonso; 6 Massa; 7 Raikkonen; 8 Bottas; 9 Magnussen; 10 Kvyat . Wow. What a session. Rosberg sticks it on provisional pole but Hamilton, despite locking up in the first corner, comes through... only seven thousandths of a second quicker. Ricciardo is the first man to launch his assault on pole. What can the Aussie do? He is really giving it his all, and as he comes over the line, yes, that's provisional pole for the Red Bull man. What can the rest of the field do? 'I have no power.' reports Raikkonen and he is told he will have to stop on track. What a shame. He was a real contender for pole here. 'If we have got any more front wing put it in', says Hamilton. Probably an understatement to say this isn't the best of starts for the Mercedes rivals. They'll all have one more shot at pole. Anyway back on track and Massa is the first driver to complete a timed lap. It is a 1:46.007. What can Ricciardo do? He is six thousandths of a second down on the Williams. Rosberg comes through and he is only seventh with Hamilton off the pace, too. He is sixth. Wow. It looks as though we have got a big upset on our hands. Romain Grosjean meanwhile was furious on his team radio at the end of Q2. He will start only 16th. 'I cannot believe it! Bloody engine! Bloody engine!' It looks as though the Frenchman wasn't overly pleased with the performance of his Renault V6. The 12-minute session is underway in Singapore as we determine the top 10 for tomorrow's Singapore Grand Prix. Mercedes will start as favourites, but Ferrari and Red Bull could mount a real challenge. Watch this space... Button will start only 11th tomorrow while Magnussen seals his spot in Q3. The rookie is 8-6 up on his world championship-winning team-mate this season. Rosberg, on the supersoft compound, heads to the top of the timesheets by almost half-a-second. So, the top four of Hamilton, Alonso, Raikkonen and Ricciardo are staying in the pits, but Rosberg has gone out, meaning the championship leader will use one more set of tyres than his rivals. Hulkenberg, Massa, Bottas, Perez, Gutierrez and Grosjean occupy the bottom six with four minutes remaining. We're revving up for the final runs here. The top 12 are separated by just 1.2 seconds. Indeed the top five of Hamilton, Alonso, Raikkonen, Ricciardo and Rosberg are separated by just two tenths. We have got a realy qualifying session on our hands here. Hamilton then goes fastest, but only by a whisker. This is really cementing Ferrari's status as challengers for pole today. Rosberg meanwhile, fails to go faster than either Alonso or Raikkonen. Indeed he's 5th with Ricciardo in P4. And Raikkonen starts where he left off. The Finn heads to the top of the timesheets, but his lap is bettered by team-mate Alonso, but only by three thousandths of a second. We're back underway at the Marina Bay Circuit - this session will determine who makes it through to the top-10 shootout. That's the first time Raikkonen has been quickest in any session so far this season. It's also the third different session where they've topped the timesheets this weekend; they've only been quickest in four sessions the entire season. So, an interesting Q1, there. No great upsets in regards to the bottom six, but two Ferraris at the top of the timesheets? And Raikkonen quicker than Alonso? It's fair to say, none of us would have predicted that. And here is Vettel gesticulating at Kvyat earlier in the session... They've looked strong all weekend and Raikkonen and Alonso now head a 1-2 in Singapore. Hamilton, in his Mercedes, tries to respond, but he is almost three tenths shy of Raikkonen's best lap. But as I write that, Button goes second fastest and Vettel pops his Red Bull into P6. The world champions are safe, but Felipe Massa, who has struggled this weekend, is in trouble in 16th. Nico Hulkenberg posts a 1:47.370 to move to the top of the lap charts with some three minutes remaining. Jenson Button on the bubble here. He is 17th... and Vettel is still yet to post a time. Vettel in a spot of bother here. The four-times world champion is yet to set a time with only five minutes remaining. He then waves his hand at Daniil Kvyat after the Russian, despite being on a slower lap, refused to move off the racing line. The German will have to go again. So, Rosberg has popped in a timed lap but he is only sixth, the best part of a second down on Hamilton. He heads to the pits and takes on a set of supersoft tyres. Hamilton then heads to the top of the timesheets, three tenths quicker than Alonso. A big lock-up for Romain Grosjean in the Lotus and he is reporting a major problem with his brakes. It never rains, but it pours for those at the Enstone-based team this year. But Bottas is quickly usurped by that man Alonso. He's been on fire this weekend hasn't he? His last dry pole was four years ago, here, in Singapore. Could he repeat that feat again today? Valtteri Bottas is leading the way with seven minutes of Q1 gone - only nine drivers are yet to have posted times so far. An early mistake from Rosberg who goes in too deep on the run down to Turn 8. Instead of flat-spotting his tyres, as in Monza, he goes straight on, and then has to reach for reverse. He'll have plenty of time to recover, but hardly an ideal start for the world championship leader. A lot like the incident during qualifying in Monaco that one. The pit-lane is open and we are underway in Singapore. Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton are already on track and the latter is told to remember that he has new brakes for the opening session. Gordon Ramsay, the potty-mouthed chef, is in the McLaren garage today.  I wonder if Jenson Button will be able to cook up a storm today? Apologies. The drivers are in their cars and we are only moments away from Q1 - the 18-minute opening session which will see the six slowest cars eliminated. 1. N Rosberg (Mercedes) 2382. L Hamilton (Mercedes) 2163. D Ricciardo (Red Bull)1664. V Bottas (Williams) 1225. F Alonso (Ferrari) 1216. S Vettel (Red Bull) 1067. J Button (McLaren) 728. N Hulkenberg (Force India) 70 . Social media was awash with claims Mercedes had fixed the Italian Grand Prix in wake of the collision between Hamilton and Rosberg in Spa. The theory went that the German, under orders from his team, deliberately went straight on at Turn One in order to gift the win to his team-mate. It was a claim subsequently denied by Mercedes and much of the paddock. And you can read Rosberg’s version of events in his MailOnline column. Fernando Alonso was the surprise pacesetter in the final practice session ahead of qualifying. The Ferrari man was marginally quicker than Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo with the Mercedes pair of Rosberg 3rd and Hamilton only 6th. Could we be in for an upset today? I'm sure many of you would be delighted to see Alonso claim pole for Ferrari... but something tells me Mercedes will have the pace when they need it. But while the race for this year’s championship continues to intensify, much of the paddock talk so far this weekend has centred around the new radio rules… and the subsequent U-turn. Struggling to get your head around it? You're not the only one. You can read the very latest on what is allowed, and what isn’t, right here. My thoughts are that it will be very hard to police; the FIA have just eight men watching transmissions from 22 drivers and their respective engineers. I dare say it could lead to a controversy of sorts, but what would Formula One be without some of that? Lewis Hamilton is the man in form after his win last time out in Monza. The Briton forced title rival Nico Rosberg into a mistake at Turn One to claim his first victory since July’s British Grand Prix. The victory took Hamilton to within 22 points of Rosberg ahead of this weekend’s race under the lights. The Singapore Grand Prix has been an instant hit on the calendar since its debut in 2008… and surely we’re in for a corker this time round, too.","Hamilton posted the fastest time at the Marina Bay Circuit to seal pole .

"Police and protesters clashed in crisis-hit Ferguson after police chief Tom Jackson issued an apology to the family of black teenager Michael Brown who was shot by one of his officers. Jackson stood outside the police station and marched briefly with protesters before scuffles broke out in the St Louis suburb. One man was arrested following the brief disturbance according to reports in the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Scroll down for video . Police chief Tom Jackson, left, is confronted by protesters angry over the shooting of Michael Brown in August . Chief Jackson, centre, marched briefly with the protesters before one man was arrested in the following group . Scuffles broke out following Chief Jackson's appearance with protesters calling for his resignation . Jackson told protesters: 'All those things that are causing mistrust are being evaluated and we are going to be making changes.' Three other protesters were arrested during a later confrontation. Earlier Thursday, Jackson released a video apology to Brown's family and the community in which he acknowledged that Brown's body should have been removed from the street much sooner after he was killed. Brown's body remained on Canfield Drive, a residential street, for more than four hours while police collected evidence. He said: 'It was just too long and I'm truly sorry for that. Please know that the investigating officers meant no disrespect to the Brown family, to the African-American community or the people of Canfield (Drive). They were simply trying to do their jobs. Addressing the Brown family directly, Jackson said: 'I'm truly sorry for the loss of your son.' Brown's parents declined comment when told about Jackson's video during a news conference with civil rights leaders at the National Press Club. Their attorney later said they hadn't heard about the video but would review it. Speaking out: Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson released this video apology on Thursday morning to say sorry to the family of slain teen Michael Brown for leaving his body in the street for so long . Brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot on August  9 during a confrontation with Officer Darren Wilson. The shooting sparked numerous protests and racial unrest in the predominantly black community. Some residents and civil rights activists have said responding police officers were overly aggressive, noting their use of tear gas and military-style vehicles and gear. 'It is clear that we have much work to do,' Jackson said in the video. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the Ferguson Police Department for possible civil rights violations. A total of four people were arrested during last night's civil rights protest in Ferguson, Missouri . Tensions in the St Louis suburb have been extremely high since Michael Brown was shot on August 9 . Protesters are especially angry that police left Mr Brown's body on the street while they gathered evidence . 'I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street. The time that it took involved very important work on the part of investigators, who were trying to collect evidence and gain a true picture of what happened that day, but it was just too long, and I am truly sorry for that.' It took police officers more than four hours to remove Brown's body from the street after he was shot dead by white police officer Darren Wilson on August 9. Brown, who was black, was not armed. 'Please know that the investigating officers meant no disrespect to the Brown family, to the African-American community or the people of Canfield,' Jackson went on. 'They were simply trying to do their jobs.' He also said sorry for the police response to protesters. Crowds began marching in the days after the shooting and escalated into violence and looting in some places. The police response was slammed as inept and Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ultimately put the Missouri State Highway Patrol in charge of policing the protests. Killed: Brown's body can be seen in the street on August 9; it took police more than four hours to remove it . Gunned down: Brown, 18, was unarmed when he was shot dead by Police Officer Darren Wilson, right . 'I do want to say to any peaceful protester who did not feel that I did enough to protect their constitutional right to protest, I am sorry for that,' Jackson said. 'The right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect. If anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry, I feel responsible, and I'm sorry.' He also acknowledged how the situation blew up overnight and drew Ferguson into a discussion about race relations and the attitude of the police across the U.S. 'Overnight I went from being a small-town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism, equality and the role of policing in that conversation,' he said. 'As chief of police, I want to be part of that conversation. I also want to be part of the solution. 'For any mistakes I've made, I take full responsibility.' The Justice Department is investigating whether the Ferguson police used excessive force, whether constitutional rights of some residents are violated by traffic stops, searches and arrests, and if police engage in discriminatory practices. Apologies: Reverend Al Sharpton, left, appears with the parents of Michael Brown, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., at a news conference on Thursday. Chief Jackson today apologized to the family . Ongoing violence: On Tuesday, a memorial for Michael Brown was burned down in Ferguson . Jackson was not at the meeting but has said he welcomes the investigation. Even now, unrest continues in the area. Fire destroyed a memorial to Brown at the site of the shooting early on Tuesday, generating new anger among some residents. Police say the cause of the fire is under investigation. The fire may have been the spark for a violent protest Tuesday night. One store was damaged by looting, another was set on fire, and police were attacked with rocks and bottles. Two officers suffered injuries when they were hit by rocks. A state grand jury is weighing if Wilson will face criminal charges, but a decision isn't expected until mid-October at the earliest.","Four people arrested as Ferguson police chief issues Brown family apology .

"Britain will turn ‘very nasty’ if politicians continue to ignore the pressure immigrants put on housing, schools and hospitals, a Labour MP has warned. Frank Field said there is no plan to address the strain on public services, despite the population increasing by the size of Birmingham every two-and-a-half years. The former employment minister said this level of immigration must be questioned at a time of deep spending cuts. Scroll down for video .

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Yet there are no plans for increasing housing or places in schools, at a time when we will in the next parliament, have to make cuts greater than the cuts made in this parliament. ‘That is the underlying theme to politics which, if we as politicians continue to ignore what is going on, is obviously going to become very nasty.’ He said it would be ‘foolish’ to claim immigrants make no positive contribution. But he added: ‘The dispute is actually how big that contribution is because, quite naturally, people who come here to work draw the proceeds of work. ‘What is actually left over in their contribution to the wider community is a lot less, I think, than people maintain. ‘But I don’t think it is a question about that any more.’","Minister warns of the strain mass migration is placing on public services .

"It was a wedding present from the Queen that fell into rack and ruin and became the last symbol of Prince Andrew’s failed marriage to Sarah Ferguson. The once grand former home of the Duke of York became mired in controversy seven years ago when he sold it to Kazakh tycoon Timur Kulibayev for £15 million – £3 million more than the asking price – and criticism grew as it was left to rot. Now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that plans to demolish the much derided ‘Tesco-style’ mansion in Berkshire and replace it with a similarly lavish house have been thwarted – by bats in the rafters. Scroll down for video . The once grand former home of the Duke of York became mired in controversy seven years ago when he sold it to Kazakh tycoon Timur Kulibayev for £15 million – £3 million more than the asking price . Despite winning permission to bulldoze Sunninghill Park a year ago, its new owners have just had to apply for fresh permission to continue with the project, and find alternative accommodation for the rare bats which are protected. According to documents submitted to the local council by architects, a survey found at least 100 bats flapping around the building or emerging from holes in the roof. The species include common pipistrelles, soprano pipistrelles, noctules, brown long-eared, mouse-eared and Leisler’s. Experts recommended that alternative roosts be built in nearby trees before demolition work on the dilapidated building can finally begin. The home was a wedding present from the Queen that fell into rack and ruin and became the last symbol of Prince Andrew’s failed marriage to Sarah Ferguson . A brown long-eared bat - one of the five species that have been found lodging in the rood of the dilapidated mansion . The property – dubbed SouthYork because of its resemblance to the house on the ranch in the US television soap Dallas – boasted 12 bedrooms with en suite bathrooms, a marble-floored hallway, offices, a cinema, stables, billiards room and swimming pool. Now it is a shadow of its former self, with broken windows and boarded-up doors. After its sale in 2007, a year after Sarah Ferguson and her daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie moved out, the house was left derelict. It prompted speculation that Kulibayev, the billionaire son-in-law of Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev, had bought it only to win the Prince’s friendship during his time as a UK trade ambassador. But Buckingham Palace insisted the sale was ‘a straight commercial transaction’. Kulibayev acknowledged ownership only after a newspaper investigation revealed he had used offshore companies to make the purchase. After its sale in 2007, a year after Sarah Ferguson and her daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie moved out, the house was left derelict . Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson at the Berkshire site as it was built after their marriage . It was suggested that his former mistress, millionairess socialite Goga Ashkenazi – a close friend of Prince Andrew – was instrumental in securing the sale. The bat survey, which is part of the application submitted to Bracknell Forest Council, was commissioned by HOK International, which is an agent for the owners Unity Assets Corporation, though it is not clear who will live in the new house. An initial assessment in June concluded: ‘This is a suspected roost of moderate quality’, and added: ‘Because the number of tiles is so large there are several gaps which bats could roost under.’ It recommended that two further bat ‘emergence’ surveys should be carried out at dusk, and further observations were made in August and September. Local authority planners will now consider the report before making a decision next month. Designed by Sir James Dunbar-Nasmith, SouthYork was given to Prince Andrew by his mother after his marriage in 1986.

"A man is suing after allegedly waking from a colonoscopy medical procedure in women's pink underwear. Andrew Walls, 32, from the city of Dover, Delaware, claims the underwear was put on him when he was under anesthesia at Delaware Surgery Center in October 2012. He is now  seeking damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress - in court papers his lawyer states he suffered mental anguish, lost wages and loss of earning capacity. A Delaware man is suing after allegedly waking from a colonoscopy medical procedure in women's pink underwear (file photo) Mr Walls was an employee of Delaware Surgery Center when he underwent the colonoscopy, reports Delaware Online. 'When the plaintiff recovered from the effects of the anesthesia administered by defendants, he awoke to realize that while he was unconscious pink women's underwear had been placed on his body,' according to the civil damages suit filed in New Castle County Superior Court. 'When the plaintiff initially presented for his colonoscopy he had not been wearing pink women's underwear and at no time did the plaintiff voluntarily, knowingly or intentionally place the pink women's underwear upon himself.' Andrew Walls, 32, from the city of Dover, Delaware, claims the underwear was put on him when he was under anesthesia at Delaware Surgery Center (pictured) in October 2012 . 'The defendant's extreme and outrageous conduct went beyond all possible bounds of decency,' wrote attorney Gary Nitsche in the complaint on behalf of Walls. His colleagues 'failed to maintain proper policies and procedures for the care of patients with respect to not engaging in extreme and outrageous conduct,' Nitsche's lawsuit continues. Delaware Surgery director Jennifer Anderson declined to comment Wednesday, stating: 'We just found out about this yesterday afternoon.' It is not known why Mr Walls was undergoing the colonoscopy or when he left Delaware Surgery Center.","Andrew Walls, 32, claims the underwear was put on his body when he was under anesthesia at Delaware Surgery Center in October 2012 .

Big hit: New Orleans Saint Benjamin Watson wrote a Facebook post about the events in Ferguson, Missouri on Tuesday that has since gone viral . He then pours his heart out and the unfiltered emotion no doubt helped the post get nearly 400,000 likes in less than one day. 'I'm angry because the stories of injustice that have been passed down for generations seem to be continuing before our very eyes,' he says. Watson also moves between feeling anger for the treatment of black Americans and frustration with the violent reactions to the decision. 'In the back of my mind I know...I could still be looked upon as a ""threat"" to those who don't know me. So I will continue to have to go the extra mile to earn the benefit of the doubt,' he writes. Watson's negative feelings ultimately give way to positive ones as he writes about his Christian faith. 'I'm encouraged, because ultimately the problem is not a SKIN problem, it is a SIN problem.

The tight end's 650-word outpouring of emotion had been shared on Facebook over 200,000 after fewer than 24 hours and received nearly 400,000 likes . At some point while I was playing or preparing to play Monday Night Football, the news broke about the Ferguson Decision. After trying to figure out how I felt, I decided to write it down. Here are my thoughts: . I'M ANGRY because the stories of injustice that have been passed down for generations seem to be continuing before our very eyes. I'M FRUSTRATED, because pop culture, music and movies glorify these types of police citizen altercations and promote an invincible attitude that continues to get young men killed in real life, away from safety movie sets and music studios. I'M FEARFUL because in the back of my mind I know that although I'm a law abiding citizen I could still be looked upon as a ""threat"" to those who don't know me. So I will continue to have to go the extra mile to earn the benefit of the doubt. I'M EMBARRASSED because the looting, violent protests, and law breaking only confirm, and in the minds of many, validate, the stereotypes and thus the inferior treatment. I'M SAD, because another young life was lost from his family, the racial divide has widened, a community is in shambles, accusations, insensitivity hurt and hatred are boiling over, and we may never know the truth about what happened that day. I'M SYMPATHETIC, because I wasn't there so I don't know exactly what happened. Maybe Darren Wilson acted within his rights and duty as an officer of the law and killed Michael Brown in self defense like any of us would in the circumstance. Now he has to fear the backlash against himself and his loved ones when he was only doing his job. What a horrible thing to endure. OR maybe he provoked Michael and ignited the series of events that led to him eventually murdering the young man to prove a point. I'M OFFENDED, because of the insulting comments I've seen that are not only insensitive but dismissive to the painful experiences of others. I'M CONFUSED, because I don't know why it's so hard to obey a policeman. You will not win!!! And I don't know why some policeman abuse their power. Power is a responsibility, not a weapon to brandish and lord over the populace. I'M INTROSPECTIVE, because sometimes I want to take ""our"" side without looking at the facts in situations like these. Sometimes I feel like it's us against them. Sometimes I'm just as prejudiced as people I point fingers at. And that's not right. How can I look at white skin and make assumptions but not want assumptions made about me? That's not right. I'M HOPELESS, because I've lived long enough to expect things like this to continue to happen. I'm not surprised and at some point my little children are going to inherit the weight of being a minority and all that it entails. I'M HOPEFUL, because I know that while we still have race issues in America, we enjoy a much different normal than those of our parents and grandparents. I see it in my personal relationships with teammates, friends and mentors. And it's a beautiful thing. I'M ENCOURAGED, because ultimately the problem is not a SKIN problem, it is a SIN problem. SIN is the reason we rebel against authority. SIN is the reason we abuse our authority. SIN is the reason we are racist, prejudiced and lie to cover for our own. SIN is the reason we riot, loot and burn. BUT I'M ENCOURAGED because God has provided a solution for sin through the his son Jesus and with it, a transformed heart and mind. One that's capable of looking past the outward and seeing what's truly important in every human being. The cure for the Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner tragedies is not education or exposure. It's the Gospel. So, finally, I'M ENCOURAGED because the Gospel gives mankind hope.","New Orleans Saint Benjamin Watson wrote down all his feelings about the decision not to indict Darren Wilson on Tuesday .

"Passengers flying into, or out of Europe, will now be able to use portable electronics including phones and tablets at any time during their flights. Starting immediately, European-based airlines can, at their own discretion, allow passengers to leave electronics on throughout the entire flight, without putting them into Airplane Mode. But, airlines will need to certify their planes aren't affected by transmission signals before allowing devices to be used. The European Aviation Safety Agency in Germany has issued new guidelines. They state that passengers can use portable electronics, including phones and tablets, at any time during flights . They will also need to equip their aircrafts with network connectors to make it possible to get online, for example. The statement was made by Cologne-based European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Spokesman Ilias Maragakis said the plans are a step beyond what's allowed by the US Federal Aviation Administration. Earlier this year, US security officials introduced mandatory checks for electronic devices on flights. Under the plans, passengers must be able to power on their phone or table. If they can't, then they either can't board the flight, or they have to hand over the gadget. In July, ministers in the UK announced these checks on electronic devices would be expanded. Checks will apply to passengers flying both in and out of UK. Flights involved include those to and from the Middle East and East Africa. However, reports claim British Airways and Virgin will fund the return of passengers' confiscated devices. ‘We're basically opening the door where, in theory, you'll be able to continue making your phone call through the gate throughout the flight, like you would on a train.’ British Airways already lets passengers on its business-class flights from London to New York to use Wi-Fi and send texts, and is starting to relax the regulations on other flights as well. Passengers are not allowed to make voice calls, both other Wi-Fi and through their network, to avoid annoying other passengers. In addition, there is no network signal at high altitudes. EASA's previous guidance, from last year, allowed electronic devices for almost the whole flight, so long as they were not transmitting any signals by being put into Airplane Mode. Similarly, the US Federal Aviation Administration lifted its own restrictions on the use of most personal electronic devices during takeoffs and landings. This does not include calls, which fall under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and are prohibited. Airlines will need to certify planes aren't affected by transmission signals. They will also need to equip craft with network connectors . Before the FAA's announcement in October, the agency had long barred the use of electronic devices below 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) because of concern they could cause electronic interference with aircraft systems during landings, the phase of flight when accidents are most likely to occur. Due to differences among fleets and operations, the agency said the implementation will vary among airlines, but the agency expects many carriers will prove to the FAA their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode, gate-to-gate, by the end of the year. The FAA based its decision on input from a group of experts that included representatives from the airlines, aviation manufacturers, passengers, pilots, flight attendants, and the mobile technology industry. Maragakis said the new guidance applies to any European-based carrier, no matter where the flight originates.","The European Aviation Safety Agency in Germany has issued new guidelines .
They state that passengers can use portable electronics, including phones and tablets, at any time during flights .
Some airlines already allowed Wi-Fi to be used in flights, but the changes mean all flights in Europe can fly without the restrictions .

"Manchester City’s finances are set for a boost after it emerged they are ready to renegotiate their current kit deal with sportswear giants Nike. City still have three-years left on the deal - worth £12million a year – they signed almost three years ago but the club’s on-field success and off-field value has continued to grow since then and it is understood that both sides are now ready to get round the negotiating table again. The Barclays Premier League champions will not be able to match the astronomical sums neighbours United rake in  – their deal with adidas which kicks in next season is worth £75m-a-year – but nevertheless City will expect to agree a significantly increased sum this time round. Manchester City, who drew with Everton at the weekend thanks to a goal from Fernandinho (pictured celebrating) are close to beginning negotiations with sportswear giants Nike over a new kit deal . City currently rake in £12million a year from Nike and have three years left on their current contract . 1) Arsenal - Puma (£30m a year) 2) Chelsea - adidas (£30m a year) 3) Liverpool - Warrior (£25m a year) 4) Manchester United - Nike (£20m a year*) 5) Manchester City - Nike (£12m a year) * Manchester United's association with Nike ends this year, with a £75m-a-year deal with adidas starting for the 2015-16 season . Certainly it will be a surprise if City don’t manage to increase their deal to around the £20m mark and the fact that Nike have recently lost United and Arsenal from their Premier League cast list will only increase the US company’s determination to keep their most prominent remaining club happy. Any hike in the deal would be welcome. City failed UEFA’s Financial Fair Play test last year and the make-up of the club’s parent company, City Football Group, is currently being looked into by European football’s governing body. They were fined a record £50m for their FFP breaches, and their payment - along with Paris St Germain and Zenit St Petersburg, who also failed the fair play rules - will be shared out among the other clubs in the Champions League and Europa League. Nike will be keen to keep City happy, as their 13-season sponsorship deal with United ends this year . Global sportswear brand Nike also had a deal with Arsenal, but lost out to Puma, who pay £30m a year . Their initial payments will total £20m, to be shared among the clubs who did comply with the rules last season, including Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea. On top of this, City's financial accounts are being scrutinised by UEFA, as revealed by Nick Harris in the Mail on Sunday. It is being assessed whether an attempt has been made to mislead the European governing body over the full extent of the club's financial losses in 2013-14. UEFA are examining whether the creation of a set of subsidiary companies by City’s ‘parent’ company, City Football Group (CFG), allowed City to under-report the club’s losses. Two particular subsidiary companies alone had costs, including wages, of £36.7million in the year to the end of May 2014, and posted combined losses of £25.9m in that period. Most of their business was done effectively on behalf of Manchester City FC in that period.","Manchester City currently have a £12million-a-year kit deal with Nike .

He filmed the shark, believed to be a juvenile, pacing the water about 50 metres from the jetty before his excitement took hold as it started coming closer. 'Wow, it's a great white, it's a great white... yeah,' he can be heard yelling. 'That was insane, a big great white.' Clinton Bambach, who is a keen fisherman, said the shark was doing loops as it chased bait fish . The overly excited fisherman filmed the moment the juvenile great white shark came within a metre of him while he was fishing off the jetty . He filmed the shark pacing the water about 50 metres from the jetty before his excitement took hold as it started coming closer . Mr Bambach said the shark was drawn into the area due to the large amount of bait fish but reacted when another man started splashing the water. 'In my eyes, the shark has heard the splashing and come back to have a look at what was all the commotion, like a bait fish splashing the surface,' he said. 'But when he saw the human hand, it wasn't a food source so he didn't aggressively tail kick and attack that food source. 'Sharks are hungry and they will eat, but they won't just eat a human hand because he sees it splashing.' 'Wow, it's a great white, it's a great white... yeah,' he can be heard yelling . Mr Bambach said the shark was drawn into the area due to the large amount of bait fish but reacted when another man started splashing the water .","Clinton Bambach was fishing at Murrays Beach, south of Newcastle, on Thursday morning when he spotted the shark .

"A highly respected religious studies teacher was facing jail last night after he was convicted of having a sexual relationship with a besotted 16-year-old pupil. Married Stuart Kerner, 44, had sex with the girl at school – taking her virginity in a store cupboard on a yoga mat. He also took her to his family home when his wife was at work and had sex with her in their guest bedroom. In between sex sessions he made her Marmite on toast and they watched Bargain Hunt on television. His defence tried to claim the victim had invented a fantasy relationship based on the novel Fifty Shades Of Grey, in which an older, more experienced man has an affair with a younger woman. Stuart Kerner, pictured with wife Katy, has been found guilty of having sex with a pupil in empty classrooms and cleaning cupboards at a south east London school . But Kerner was convicted by a majority verdict of two counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. Father-of-one Kerner, who was also vice principal at Bexleyheath Academy, South East London, sobbed as the verdict was delivered. His wife Katharine was inconsolable and fled from the court. ‘She’s destroyed our lives,’ she said. ‘This is a miscarriage of justice, she’s a liar’. The victim, now 19 but who cannot be named for legal reasons, nodded as the verdict was delivered. Teachers at Bexleyheath Academy (pictured) in south east London told the court the pupil was a 'liar' Over two weeks, Inner London Crown Court heard how the ‘troubled’ victim had a schoolgirl crush on Kerner and was ‘besotted’. It was said he ‘gave in to temptation’. A member of the victim’s family reported the affair to police in 2013 and Kerner was sent home from school on gardening leave. Prosecutor Warwick Tatford said: ‘This was a gross breach of trust – a teacher giving in to temptation. The Crown aren’t saying she’s innocent in all this. She was anxious to have a relationship with him ... (But) he was a senior teacher who took advantage of a vulnerable young girl.’ THE court heard the victim was a ‘troubled’ child who had told lies to get attention. Jurors were told she was able to give such graphic details about her encounters with Stuart Kerner because she had read the erotic novel Fifty Shades Of Grey, which portrays sex between a graduate and a powerful businessman. Edward Ellis, defending, said the teenager copied scenes from the book – which she confirmed to the jury she had read. The court also heard that the victim had a ‘difficult’ relationship with her mother – who admitted hitting her – and later ran away to go and live with her father. Her stepmother found out about her relationship with a teacher after questioning her about unrelated ‘sexual material’ on her mobile phone. An investigation began after her stepmother told the police. Teachers said the victim was ‘very bright’ , but said she also told lies to get attention. Librarian Marion King said: ‘As she got older she got very cocky and thought everybody fancied her.’ She added: ‘I think she had a crush on [Kerner].’ She told how on one occasion the teenager turned up to school claiming to have been in a car accident. But teachers eventually discovered from her mother there had been no accident. Prosecutor Warwick Tatford said: ‘It’s very easy for the defence to say “she’s a liar, don’t believe a word she says”. [But] She has been very frank about the fact that she has lied about other stuff.’ Mr Ellis told the girl: ‘You are a liar and you lie to get attention. This amounts to an elaborate fantasy that you created.’ She replied: ‘I disagree.’ The court was told that the pair first had sex on February 28, 2012. Kerner sent a message to the girl while she was in class, asking her to meet him. She was on ‘tenterhooks’ as she was ‘anxious to lose her virginity’. ‘My first lesson was IT,’ she said. ‘In the lesson I had a note. It said, “Go to reception immediately”. My name was on it, it was in his handwriting. I didn’t go to reception – I went to his office. He said go to this room during the fourth lesson.’ She said they then had sex after Kerner moved a table in front of the door and put a blanket over a yoga mat. She later feared she was pregnant, it was claimed. Shortly afterwards, someone using Kerner’s login and password changed the victim’s attendance record on the school computer system to say she had been in the lesson. The following day Kerner was absent from school as his wife, who supported him during the trial, had a miscarriage. In a video interview with police played to jurors, the schoolgirl said: ‘I felt special. But, I dunno, it wasn’t really. And admitting that does kind of hurt.’ She said ‘hand on heart’ Kerner would never have made a move on her without her encouragement, and that she fell ‘in love’ with him. She told a detective: ‘I knew it was wrong, but it felt right as well ... There was always a little voice at the back of my head saying “He’s just using you”.’ Kerner denied all the charges, saying the girl was a ‘devious and wicked liar’. He claimed she had found out details about him – including the type of underwear he wore and about a scar on his back – from eavesdropping on his conversations with other teachers. Kerner said she also knew information about his home because he had given a presentation about his home life to pupils. But she was able to draw a detailed plan of his £500,000 detached home in Aylesford, Kent, for police, pinpointing the guest bedroom where they had sex on October 3, 2012. Mr Tatford said: ‘It’s possible that [the victim] could have found out things but she would have to be a real detective to find out everything’. He added: ‘Somebody is lying, it’s either [the victim] or Mr Kerner, whoever it is is telling very wicked lies...[if it’s Kerner] he’s deceived his friends, his colleagues at school and his wife’. The victim told police that on October 3, Kerner picked her up in his car from a leisure centre before driving her to his home. Kerner made her Marmite on toast while they watched Bargain Hunt on television during breaks from sex. She said: ‘It was probably the best day I can remember, just being with him.’ After sex in the guest room, the pair also roamed the house, where the teacher had a large photo of his eight-year-old son hanging on the wall, she said. Analysis of Kerner’s phone showed he made two journeys to Bexleyheath at around the same time the victim said he picked her up and then dropped her off. The girl told the court how she also kept a coded diary and marked each page with different ‘smiley faces’ to record their encounters. She said Kerner bought her a souvenir Fifty Shades Of Grey keyring. The girl’s mother later found a keyring matching its description in a box in her bedroom. Jurors were told how Kerner took the pupil's virginity in the same week his wife Katy (both pictured outside court today) suffered a miscarriage. She told police Kerner had described their relationship as ‘written in the stars’ and likened their affair to the well-known case of a teacher who ran away to France with a pupil. A number of colleagues gave evidence on behalf of Kerner, saying he was a ‘great teacher’ and the court heard he was previously ‘a man of exemplary good character’. Speaking about Mrs Kerner, Edward Ellis, defending, said: ‘She has been supporting her husband, the man she fell in love with 25 years ago. She gave him a son which Mr Kerner dotes on.’ The jury of six men and six women cleared him of four other charges of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. They also cleared him of two counts of sexual activity with a child, which were said to have happened when she was 15. Judge Joanna Greenberg warned Kerner that all sentencing options remained open. He was bailed until sentencing on January 14.","Stuart Kerner, 44, found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child .

"England got the result they desperately needed against Samoa but Stuart Lancaster and his coaching staff did not get the performance they desired. Michael Cheika will bring his wounded Wallabies to Twickenham next week for England's final game of the autumn international series and serious improvement is needed if Lancaster's troops are to take a prized southern hemisphere scalp in November. Here, Sportsmail looks at five things England learned from the match. ENGLAND'S FORWARDS PACK A PUNCH . England's attack may lack fluency and tempo, but their set piece remains one of the best in the world. England's lineout, bar a few late blips, operated beautifully again on Saturday night with Rob Webber hitting his targets with ease. Bath lock Dave Attwood continues to impress and did not take a backward step against the ultra-physical Samoan forwards. The scrum remains a huge weapon for England going forward with young props Kieran Brookes and Matt Mullan providing huge impact off the bench. England's scrum was once again outstanding and squeezed vital penalties out of the Samoan pack . FORD CAN GIVE ENGLAND FOCUS . George Ford was picked by Stuart Lancaster to give England more direction out wide and the Bath fly half certainly delivered a promising performance. Ford's wraparound with Owen Farrell created the space for Jonny May's opening try while his pin-point cross-kick allowed Anthony Watson to put Mike Brown over in the right corner. Ford is made of tough stuff as well. The young number 10 copped several big hits including a huge tackle from Samoa lock Filo Paulo early in the contest and bounced straight back up after Jonny Leota's thundering tackle in the second half. George Ford impressed for England against the Samoans in difficult conditions at Twickenham . ENGLAND'S MIDFIELD IS STILL A CENTRAL ISSUE . Farrell and Brad Barritt were solid but unspectacular against Samoa. Granted, conditions were difficult and the Samoans put in a monstrous defensive effort but Lancaster still has major issues in midfield. Farrell had an indifferent night and was substituted for Billy Twelvetrees in the 64th minute. Barritt could be England's answer at inside centre but does not have the acceleration or creativity to make inroads in the outside channels. Manu Tuilagi remains England's premier attacking three-quarter and there is no doubt that Lancaster will be keeping an eye on Luther Burrell's progress following his recent return from injury. Owen Farrell had a tough night at the office against a fired-up Samoan defence . CHRIS ROBSHAW IS STILL ENGLAND'S MAIN MAN . Chris Robshaw has come in for some staunch criticism in recent weeks. The Harlequins skipper has often been pilloried for his breakdown skills and ball carrying impact. Many feel Robshaw is not in the same league as out and out 'fetchers' such as Richie McCaw, Michael Hooper and Schalk Burger in terms of the dark arts of openside play. Against a powerful Samoan backrow, Robshaw excelled and rightfully took home the Man of the Match award. The England skipper also topped the tackle charts with 21 hits and outshone his fellow backrowers Ben Morgan and James Haskell. England skipper Chris Robshaw had a superb game on a difficult night for his team . ENGLAND HAVE THE PACK AND HALF-BACKS TO BEAT AUSTRALIA . England can round off a disappointing November series and defeat the Wallabies next Saturday but only if Stuart Lancaster goes back to basics. England have admirably sought to evolve their game in the last 12 months but if Lancaster's side implement their 'all-court' game against Australia, they will be ripped to shreds. The Wallabies caused Ireland all sorts of problems when they injected tempo into their play and have an arsenal of outside backs who can hurt England. If England keep it tight, pick Ford and Ben Youngs at half-back and play the percentages, they can strangle the Wallabies at Twickenham. England have the forward muscle and the set-piece to strangle a suspect Wallabies pack next Saturday .","England laboured to a 28-9 victory over Samoa at Twickenham .

"Five days before he was killed outside a Melbourne police station, Numan Haider stood outside a shopping centre waving around a flag believed to be the one used by terror group Islamic State, while wearing army pants and handing out brochures about the Muslim faith. It was a dramatic change for the 18-year-old, who would more often be seen stacking shelves at a Coles supermarket, spruiking mangoes at his local fruit store as a schoolboy or praying at the mosque. Witnesses said the teenager was with a group of men outside the Dandenong Hub - a shopping arcade in Melbourne's outer eastern suburbs - when they were questioned by as many as 15 police officers last Thursday. On Tuesday, Haider was shot dead by a Victorian police officer after he allegedly stabbed two police officers near the Endeavour Hills Police Station. Scroll down for video . Profile picture: Numan Haider was decked out in military-style clothing in his latest Facebook pictures. Job: Haider worked as a spruiker and cleaner at the Dandenong Fruit Fair. The scene: This is Dandenong Hub, where Haider is alleged to have waved an Islamic State flag and handed out pamphlets promoting his faith. The Victorian Police officer was discharged from Dandenong Hospital on Thursday afternoon, a spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. 'The AFP (Australian Federal Police) member remains in a serious but stable condition,' she said. George Sarkatzis, who owns Alabenlo music store at the arcade, said he had spoken to the teenager following Thursday's incident. He said about five to eight police officers surrounded the group on Thursday afternoon. He spoke to Haider after the police left. 'He wasn't like angry, he was just upset,' Mr Sarkatzis told Daily Mail Australia. 'He said: ""I don't have the freedom to express my beliefs""'. 'My main concern was if you want to preach a belief in a peaceful place, don't wear army pants.' But this is not the first time Mr Sarkatzis had seen a group gather outside the Dandenong Hub. 'I've seen (people) now and again. They do come here and canvass their beliefs but I'm not sure if they were the same beliefs that he had.' Another witness - who works in a shop close to where police pulled Haider aside - said officers had asked the 18-year-old to pose with the flag but refused. 'There was a young guy, 18 or 19, and there were ten to 15 police officers near the pillar here,' he said. Witness: George Sarkatzis, pictured, runs a music store at the arcade. He witnessed Haider's behaviour last week. After the incident with police, Haider told Mr Sarkatzis: 'I don't have the freedom to express my beliefs'. Evening disaster: Police rush to the scene of the alleged stabbings on Tuesday evening. The incident occurred around 8pm. Police near the scene where teen terror suspect was shot dead by police on Tuesday night. Grim scenes: Authorities cart away the young man's body from near Endeavour Hills Police Station. The Melbourne Islamic centre that has been associated with Numan Haider, the 18-year-old terror suspect who was shot dead on Tuesday, said it was in no way involved with the incident. In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, the Al Furqan Islamic Information Centre said it was deeply shocked by the tragedy at Endeavour Hills. 'Al Furqan would also like to emphasise that both its centre and its president, harun Mehicevic, are in no way involved or connected to this incident.' The centre said it was disappointed with the way the mainstream media has covered the incident. It urged the media and politicians to show sensitivity. 'They were talking to him...and he had a black flag with white writing on it. 'He was carrying in his pocket or bag. The police took a picture of the flag...they took his details of the guy. 'They spoke to him for about 10 to 15 minutes.' The witness said Haider was with four to five other people who were giving out brochures. 'They had long beards and there was a skinny guy with a long beard.' Just behind where Haider was canvassing is Dandenong Plaza, where the teenager worked in the Fruit Fair a few years ago. Supervisor Nhung Dao said she recalled him working for them. 'Normally guys spruik the mangoes and pack fruit,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'At that time he was just a school boy.' Haider was studying to become an electrician at Chisholm TAFE and also stacked shelves at Coles. He wrote in an online work history that he found the fruit store job stressful. Haider, pictured behind the wheel of a car in an image posted on his Facebook page. Police look on at the scene of the murder. Suited-up members of the bomb squad attended the scene. Grieving relatives were seen coming and going from the Haider family home yesterday. Police cart away evidence from the scene. 'This work required a lot of patience due to the nature of the job,' Haider wrote. I had to work long hours, at least 10 hours a day and the maximum break you could have was only 45 minutes.' Haider had been under investigation by authorities for at least three months. However, police had become concerned about some of his recent activities and rhetoric. Distraught relatives have been seen coming and going from the family's home in Melbourne's outer suburbs. A family friend memorialised Haider in a Facebook post, writing that he was Numen 'was NOT a terrorist'. 'I'll never forget how you used to help your mum with the housework whilst everyone else were doing their own thing,' she wrote. Helicopter: The scene of Tuesday night's incident. Grim times: Victoria Police Commissioner Ken Lay (centre), with AFP Commissioner Andrew Colvin (left) and the state's premier Denis Napthine (right). Forensic teams inspect the car park where the officers were stabbed and the terror suspect was shot dead. 'I'll never forget coming home from uni and seeing you and my little brother sitting on the couch playing video games then you'd pause the game just to say salam to me when I walked into the room.' Police had raided the family home hours before the stabbing incident, Victorian police commissioner Ken Lay told ABC 774 radio on Thursday. Officers then arranged to meet him near Endeavour Hills Police Station in the city's south-eastern suburbs, where the incident occurred. Mr Lay said there was evidence suggesting Numan Haider had discussions with other people prior to the stabbing. 'There's some information that he was certainly talking to other people around the time,' Mr Lay said. 'It's certainly something we're pushing.' 'Having said that, there were some really worrying pieces about this young man's behaviour that we are working through. But Mr Lay denied reported claims Haider - who had been carrying two knives and an Islamic State flag - had been planning to conduct a beheading. Mr Lay also denied claims Haider - who had been carrying two knives - had been been planning a beheading. 'There is nothing, absolutely nothing to suggest that was the intention,' he said. Police allege Haider greeted the Victoria Police senior constable and a 43-year-old AFP officer cordially on Tuesday night. Seconds later, he repeatedly stabbed both officers. He was killed by a single shot. - With Daniel Piotrowski for Daily Mail Australia .","Teen terror suspect was confronted by police after he waved around an Islamic State flag out the front of a Dandenong Shopping Centre .

"Former Manchester United midfielder Nicky Butt has admitted that Sir Alex Ferguson made him withdraw from the England squad during his time at Old Trafford. Butt represented his country 39 times between 1997 and 2004 and was picked in the Three Lions squad for the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004. But in a question and answer session alongside ex-Red Devils team-mates Phil Neville and Ryan Giggs at Soccerex, the 39-year-old revealed that he could have won more caps for England.

Butt's revelation reignites the debate over whether Premier League bosses show enough respect to the national side and follows QPR manager Harry Redknapp claiming that players asked him to be pulled out of squads during his time in charge of Tottenham.

As well as reminiscing about his own career in the white of England, Butt also had his say on the current national set-up by stating that Roy Hodgson should exclusively play young players in order for them to mature together in the hope of winning silverware.

"Relationship: A woman (pictured) claiming to be the current girlfriend of Rurik Jutting has described the accused prostitute killer as a 'good and intelligent . A woman claiming to be the current girlfriend of Rurik Jutting has described the accused prostitute killer as a 'good and intelligent' person who has never displayed any signs of violence. Speaking to MailOnline anonymously from Quezon City in The Philippines, the woman said she had been in a relationship with the British banker for two months, and last spoke to him on October 20. Just 11 days later Jutting was arrested following the discovery of one 'nearly decapitated' woman in a suitcase and another who had her throat slashed at his luxury flat. He appeared in court this morning for a short hearing in which the two charges of murder were read out to him and was remanded in custody until November 10. The woman told MailOnline that she first met Jutting after he and a group of male friends travelled to The Philippines in July. She said the former Bank of America Merrill Lynch employee initially formed a relationship with one of her friends, Ariane Guarin. That relationship is understood to have come to an end in August. In September, on what the woman described as one of Jutting's many visits to The Philippines, she started a relationship with him. She said the couple had discussed plans for her to travel to Hong Kong to stay with him but they had not yet arranged a date. This new relationship is understood to have caused a rift between the woman and Guarin, who is said to have been unhappy that Jutting had formed a new relationship so quickly. Describing his personality, the woman said Jutting was 'very strict' with other women but said it was merely a symptom of his perfectionism and his desire to 'do the right thing'. She added: 'I can say that he is a good man. A good boyfriend, sweet lover.' Graduate: Jutting, who studied at Cambridge University, pictured left with Ariane Guarin, who is believed to have been in a previous relationship with the banker.  That relationship is understood to have come to an end in August and Jutting is said to have formed a relationship with her friend (pictured right) Claims: The woman took to Facebook to defend Jutting - the man she has said is to be her boyfriend . Court date: A handcuffed Rurik Jutting is taken to a Hong Kong court by police car after being charged with the murders of the two women . A former acquaintance today said Jutting had been in a serious relationship with a British female trader which ended bitterly around two years ago. The pair had become engaged, but he was left distraught when she reportedly had an affair after moving to New York from London. The source, who declined to be named, said: 'She wanted to marry him pretty fervently and he proposed, but she ended up cheating on him.' The fiancee was forced to fly back to London because Jutting was so heartbroken, the source told the Daily Telegraph. 'It was him ultimately him who broke it off - I think he took her infidelity quite badly.' 'They tried to reconcile. But I think maybe a month or so into it he was not able to come to terms with the fact that she had been unfaithful.' Horrific death: Officers arrived at Jutting's blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment to find Jesse Lorena Ruri still alive despite gaping knife wounds to her throat and buttocks, but she died soon after . Victim: One of the two women discovered inside Jutting's luxury apartment in Hong Kong. The woman, named locally as Jesse Lorena Ruri, was 30 years old and originally from the Philippines . Butchered: Sex workers named locally as Sumarti Ningsih (left) and Jesse Lorena Ruri (right) were found dead at Jutting's blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment in Hong Kong after the investment banker called police . Jutting, a former pupil at the £34,000-a-year Winchester College, was often 'pre-occupied with power and money' and liked going out and buying tables at clubs, the friend added. It also emerged that Jutting branded himself an 'insane psychopath' in a chilling 'out-of-office' e-mail from his Bank of America Merrill Lynch account days before the bodies were found at his flat. The e-mail response read: 'I am out of the office. Indefinitely. For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. 'For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody [Last line only really worked if I had followed through].' The message would appear to suggest he had meant to kill himself. Hanging out: After police were called to his apartment, Jutting was questioned before being driven away for further questioning, leaving a forensic team to examine the scene at his flat . Surrounded: Jutting sits with a group of women. He reportedly called police at 3am on Halloween night . 'Insane psychopath': Rurik Jutting has been charged with the murder of two prostitutes found butchered at his Hong Kong flat. He is pictured here with Ariane Guarin, also known as Yanie, who is believed to be the trader's ex-girlfriend, but not the British trader to whom he was engaged, nor the woman who spoke to MailOnline . Out with the girls: Jutting, who moved to Hong Kong from London in July last year, quit his high-earning job in the city, where expat bankers lead notoriously hedonistic lifestyles . In another disturbing development, police in the former British colony were urgently investigating whether there were any more victims after photos of one of the dead women were allegedly among 2,000 pictures and videos on a smartphone used by Jutting. The American Psycho-style killing spree came to an end on Halloween night when Jutting, from Surrey, reportedly rang police shortly after 3am. Officers arrived at his blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment to find a 30-year-old Indonesian prostitute, named locally as Jesse Lorena Ruri, still alive despite gaping knife wounds to her throat and buttocks. She died soon after. Eight hours later, during a forensic examination of the flat, police officers spotted a suitcase on the balcony which had two feet protruding. Inside was the decomposing naked body of the second prostitute, 25-year-old Indonesian Sumarti Ningsih. Wan Chai – where Rurik Jutting is thought to have picked up £200-a-night prostitutes – is Hong Kong's notorious red light district. Just two blocks away from his apartment, hundreds of bars and clubs are teeming with mainly south-east Asian sex workers, who offer 'lady drinks' to potential customers before discreetly negotiating prices for sex. The area was made infamous by the 1960 film The World of Suzie Wong, about a Chinese prostitute. |t is understood the two women allegedly murdered by Jutting had travelled from their homes in Indonesia to seek a better life - and earn enough money to send back to their families, it is understood. Sumatra Ningsih, the 25-year-old whose decomposing body was found on the balcony of the apartment which Jutting was renting, had travelled to the former British colony only a month ago from her home in the central Java city of Cilacap. Prostitution is legal in Hong Kong, but many women working as 'freelancers' are doing so illegally as they are there on tourist visas – including Miss Ningsih. The second woman, aged 30, who has been living in Hong Kong for up to eight years, was known as Jesse Lorena Ruri. Officials who take responsibility for foreigners in the colony said that was not her real name. MailOnline understands that her real name is Seneng Mujiasih and that she comes from the large Indonesian island of Sulawesi, joining the many thousands of young Indonesian women who set out into the ‘outside world’ to take up a variety of jobs, many of them in the domestic service industry. 'Jesse' has told friends that she had earned enough money in her years in Hong Kong to be able to have a house built for herself and her family in Indonesia. According to a spokesman for Indonesia’s Head of Development and Productivity Placement Miss Ningsih had approached a private ‘placement company’ in Calacap, which found her a job in Hong Kong, although it was not immediately known what that work was. Officials from several welfare and workers’ organisations said last night that they were still trying to trace family members of both women who might not be aware of the grisley murders. Referring to the 25-year-old, a spokesman for the Department of Social Welfare and Manpower, said: 'We are trying to trace the address of Miss Ningsih,’ Calacap, a south coast port town lying nearly 200 miles south east of Jakarta, has a population of more than a million and competition for work is said to be intense. It was cut off from air travel when the airport closed several years ago and travellers are now faced with a tedious journey along roads jammed with motor scooters. Tourists are put off from visiting because the town’s most well known beaches have become fouled from leakage from shipping vessels that dock nearby. Despite the authorities' efforts to clean up the area, it is filled with hotel rooms that can be rented by the hour. One user wrote on the internet: 'The more expensive ones almost seem like normal business hotels – the cheaper ones are like mental hospitals.' Robberies and money-laundering are also rife and Chinese gangsters are said to run many of the bars.","Woman, speaking anonymously, claims to be Rurik Jutting's girlfriend .

"A police chief's daughter accused of joining in with male friends in violently bashing two Philadelphia gay men appears to have a long history of questionable social media behavior. A Twitter account reportedly belonging to Kathryn Knott reveals the 24-year-old emergency medical technician's propensity for bashing not just gays, but also sick patients and her own liver. Tweets on the account, which was opened in 2011 and features thousands of posts, have hastags such as '#gay #ew,' and 'Why do Asians always put their kids on a leash' among other potentially incriminating messages. Scroll down for videos... Liked to tweet: Kathryn Knott is accused of being a part of a brutal gay bashing in Philadelphia and has an active social media presence that reveals a propensity toward drinking and ridiculing others . '#gay #ew': Some of the messages could reveal a dislike for gay people, though the 24-year-old denies having played any role in the beating of the couple on September 11 . Though some years old, the tweets show a person very accustomed to the risks of overindulgence. Authorities say the group members involved in this months attack were potentially intoxicated . Suspended: A medical ethics expert told Philly.com that Knott's frequent tweets about patients at the Pennsylvania hospital where she worked could make her a liability and cost her job, from which she's already been suspended . Knott and two male friends have been charged for allegedly brutally beating a gay couple in Philadelphia after internet sleuths helped cops identify them. Knott, the  daughter of Chalfont Police Chief Karl Knott, Philip Williams, 24, and Kevin Harrigan, 26, turned themselves into Philadelphia Police early on Wednesday. The student-turned-medical tech has a lot to say about her binge drinking in addition to a nearly daily stream of complaints about the patients who come in dire need to the emergency room where she works. 'Ended my night spreading a** cheeks to suture her hemorrhoids while they pulsated blood all over me #disgusting #arewekidding?' she wrote in August 2012. It's one insensitive tweet among many that sometimes also include photos of patient x-rays and even body parts. The Philadelphia Police Department took this mugshot of Kathryn G. Knott and released it late Wednesday . Some of the tweets are merely in poor taste, while others could end up costing Knott her job, experts say . Tasteless: The account @kathryn_knott hasn't been used since last October, but since 2011 racked up some 2,500 tweets . 'A patient gave me a bag of ice with his two fingers in it!' she wrote, along with a photo of what is presumably a bag of fingers. This is the same Twitter user who brags about frequent drunkenness. 'We just got banned from the bar in HIlton Head,' she wrote in March 2012. 'When will I learn to stop drinking whiskey,' she wrote later that year. There are glimpses of a potential dislike for gay people, as well. 'Jazz flute is for little fairy boys,' she once wrote. As well as: 'the ppl we were just dancing with just turned and mafe out with eatch other #gay #ew.' Surrendered: Katheryn Knott, the daughter of a Philadelphia-area police chief, has turned herself into cops for allegedly being part of a group that viciously beat up a gay couple two weeks ago . The Philadelphia police also released these mugshot of Philip R. Williams, left, and Kevin J. Harrigan, right, on Wednesday . While most of these tweets are merely in questionable taste, Medical ethicist Art Caplan told Philly.com that the divulged patient info could cost Knott her job. 'I think she could be looking at legal liability,' Caplan said. 'If there's enough information in the tweets for others to deduce who's being discussed, that's a clear HIPAA violation.' Knott has been suspended from her position at Lansdale Hospital in Pennsylvania. In the mean time, prosecutors said the trio face criminal conspiracy, aggravated and simple assault and reckless endangerment charges for their alleged part in the vicious beating. They were allegedly part of a group that approached a gay couple, aged 26 and 28, in Center City on the evening of September 11 and said to one of the men: 'Is that your f***ing boyfriend?' The group then proceeded to beat up the men, leaving them bruised and hospitalized. One of the men needed to have his jaw wired shut. The case gained national attention when police posted a video of the well-dressed suspects and online sleuths identified them by matching the footage with photos taken in nearby restaurants and shared online. On Wednesday, Williams' attorney Fortunato Perri Jr. told reporters that the case was not related to sexual orientation, but was instead a 'mutual confrontation' in which his client 'was not the aggressor'. Heading to police: Philip Williams pictured hearing to a police station on Wednesday with his lawyer. He was one of three 20-somethings who turned themselves in today . Hurt: One of the victims shared this photo of his injuries. One of the men needed his jaw wired shut . Knott's attorney Louis Busico has also denied that the dispute was motivated by anti-gay bias and said his client neither threw any punches nor hurled any insults. 'My client played no role in this,' Busico told reporters on Wednesday. As well as the three suspects, each of whom was photographed in a mugshot released by the police, another allegedly member of the group - who has not been arrested - has been fired from his job as a Catholic high school basketball coach. Fran McGlinn, 25, was said to be among the dozen men and women when the group launched the attack on the couple. Kenneth Gavin, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, told the Daily News that McGlinn has been fired and prohibited from working at any archdiocesan school. Daddy's girl: Kathryn Knott's father, Karl Knott, left, is the police chief for Chalfont, Pennsylvania . Party-goer: Knott's attorney said she did not throw any punches or yell anything at the men during the fight . Night out: The group were caught on surveillance footage the night they allegedly beat up the two men . Gavin said that McGlinn had been serving as a coach on a 'contract basis' at the high school and was not a teacher. District Attorney Seth Williams said on Tuesday in announcing the charges that the case 'shocked the entire country'. 'An assault on people because of their sexual orientation has no place in Philadelphia,' he said. The trio have now been released on bail. KYW-TV reports that they left the police department's Central Detectives division at about 3:30 a.m. Thursday. Court documents indicate that Williams and Harrigan posted $75,000 bail and Knott posted $50,000 bail. Police had previously thanked members of the public for helping them track down suspects after they posted surveillance footage of the group online. One internet sleuth posted an image of the group he had received from a 'friend of a friend of a friend' showing the group dining out at a restaurant that evening. Caught: Internet sleuths then uncovered this photo of the same group out at a restaurant, leading them to identify some of the members. Cops thanked the internet users for working so swiftly . Kicked out: Fran McGlinn, 25, pictured left and right, has been fired from his job as a basketball coach at a Catholic high school after he allegedly featured in the video. He has not been arrested . Others identified the restaurant as La Viola and then another member of the public found out who had 'checked in' to the restaurant on Facebook - and matched the profiles with the group picture. He then contacted authorities with a list of names. Pennsylvania's hate-crimes law does not cover crimes motivated by a person's sexual orientation. Under current law, a hate crime includes incidents motivated by race, ethnicity, or religion. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, along with openly gay state Rep. Brian Sims of Philadelphia and others, have said the case illustrates the need for a change in the law.

"Twitter is suing the U.S. Department of Justice in a bid to win the right to reveal to its users the true extent of U.S. government surveillance on their accounts. The social network wants to overturn restrictions which prevent it from revealing the number of national security letters and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court orders it receives. In the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for Northern California, Twitter said current rules prevent it from even stating that it has not received any national security requests for user information. Lawsuit: Social network Twitter is demanding the right to reveal to its users the extent of U.S. government surveillance on their accounts . Twitter, the Internet's self-described champion of free speech,  said the lawsuit follows months of fruitless negotiations and claims the restrictions violate its First Amendment rights. In a blog post Twitter vice president Ben Lee wrote: 'It's our belief that we are entitled under the First Amendment to respond to our users' concerns and to the statements of U.S. government officials by providing information about the scope of U.S. government surveillance -- including what types of legal process have not been received. 'We should be free to do this in a meaningful way, rather than in broad, inexact ranges.' Currently an agreement between Internet . companies like Google Inc and Microsoft Corp . with the government allows companies to disclose the number of . orders they received, but only in broad ranges. A company that . offers email services, for example, would be able to say it . received between zero and 999 orders from the Foreign . Intelligence Surveillance Court during a six-month period for . email content belonging to someone outside the United States. Tech companies have sought to clarify their relationships . with U.S. law enforcement and spying agencies in the wake of . revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward . Snowden that outlined the depth of U.S. spying capabilities. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed how the government was harvesting data from emails, texts and social networks . The Snowden documents, first leaked in June last year, revealed that the US government has programs in place to spy on hundreds of millions of people’s emails, social networking posts, online chat histories, browsing histories, telephone records, telephone calls and texts – 'nearly everything a typical user does on the internet”, in the words of one leaked document'. In a separate case, a federal appeals court in San Francisco . on Wednesday will hear arguments on whether the FBI can gag . recipients of national security letters. A lower court judge had . ruled those secrecy guidelines unconstitutional. Twitter, which allows its 271 million monthly users to send . 140-character text messages, has traditionally taken an . aggressive posture challenging government censorship requests . and has previously described itself as 'the free-speech wing of . the free-speech party.' The American Civil Liberties Union praised Twitter's action, . saying in a statement that the company was doing the right thing . by 'challenging this tangled web of secrecy rules and gag . orders.' 'The U.S. government has taken the position that service . providers like Twitter are even prohibited from saying that they . have received zero national security requests, or zero of a . particular type of national security request,' Twitter said in . its complaint. The Justice Department responded to the lawsuit with a . statement on how it has worked with other companies. 'Earlier this year, the government addressed similar . concerns raised in a lawsuit brought by several major tech . companies,' Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said. 'There, the parties worked collaboratively to allow tech . companies to provide broad information on government requests . while also protecting national security.' The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that . defends civil liberties in the digital world, said it had been . disappointed that tech companies had given up their fight. 'EFF and a number of privacy and free-speech organizations . expressed our profound disappointment that the companies dropped . their lawsuit for so little,' Nate Cardozo, staff attorney with . the group, said on Tuesday. The government's restrictions on providing more details . about requests for user data, he said, are 'useful for one . thing, which is to keep the public in the dark about what . authorities the government uses to get our data. Twitter's lawsuit said the company has discussed the matter . with the government for months.

'We've tried to achieve the level of transparency our users . deserve without litigation, but to no avail,' Twitter said in . Tuesday's blogpost.

"Pharrell Williams, one of the biggest black figures in the music industry, has spoken out about the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, saying he is 'troubled' a grand jury decided not to indict  the white police officer responsible. But the 'Happy' singer also sparked heated debate  by calling Brown's behavior leading up to his August 9 death 'bully-ish'. Before he was shot dead, Brown was caught on surveillance camera stealing a handful of cigarillos from a convenience store in Ferguson, Missouri, and intimidating the shop owner. While Pharrell says that was no excuse for Officer Darren Wilson to use lethal force against the unarmed teen, he thinks Brown's actions are being overlooking in the national discussion about the tragedy. 'It looked very bully-ish; that in itself I had a problem with,' Pharrell told Ebony magazine. 'Not with the kid, but with whatever happened in his life for him to arrive at a place where that behavior is OK. Why aren't we talking about that?' Scroll down for video . Controversy: In a recent interview, music producer and singer Pharrell Williams (left) called police shooting victim Michael Brown's behavior leading up to his death 'bully-ish'. The caused heated debate online . Intimidating: Police released this surveillance camera footage, reportedly showing Michael Brown grabbing a convenience store owner shortly before he was stopped by Officer Darren Wilson and eventually shot dead . 'The boy was walking in the middle of the street when the police supposedly told him to “get the f*** on the sidewalk.” If you don’t listen to that, after just having pushed a storeowner, you’re asking for trouble,' he added. However, Pharrell said that Brown's behavior in the convenience store did not warrant his death, and that he believes Officer Wilson should have been charged in the death. After the story was published on Tuesday, Twitter was flooded with comments calling out Pharrell's interview. One Twitter user said: 'Mike Brown was a bully says Pharrell Williams. So do we get a pass to shoot bullies in society? Way to go Pharrell.' This isn't the first time that singer has started controversy over his opinions on race issues. In an interview with Oprah last year, Pharrell angered some when he said 'the new black doesn't blame others races for our issues'. Pharrell seemed hesitant to talk about race in the interview with the African-American monthly, saying: 'I don’t talk about race since it takes a very open mind to hear my view, because my view is the sky view. But I’m very troubled by what happened in Ferguson, Missouri.' However, he felt the need to weigh in on the current situation in the predominantly-black St Louis suburb, believing 'the hangover from Ferguson is going to be a long one, worse than Trayvon Martin'. No consequences: In the same interview with Ebony magazine, Pharrell said he was troubled that the man responsible for Brown's death, Officer Darren Wilson (pictured), will not face trial for the shooting . Anger: The grand jury decision not to indict Wilson on any charges related to Brown's death sparked violence between protesters and police in Ferguson, Missouri Monday night . Trayvon Martin was another unarmed black teen, 17, who was shot dead two years ago near to where he lived in Sanford, Florida, by a man who thought he was a burglar. Shooter George Zimmerman was controversially acquitted on any charges in the teen's death. While his comments sparked a debate online, it's clear that Pharrell feels a strong connection to the current situation in Ferguson, Missouri, where protesters turned violent after hearing the grand jury's decision Monday night. Following the decision, Pharrell tweeted: 'I'm heartbroken over the news of no indictment in Ferguson. Let's all pray for peace'. And on Monday night's episode of The Voice, he made the contestants he was mentoring switch out the lyrics in 'What a Beautiful World' with the line 'We need justice to unfurl'. He says he still believes racism exists, and that the situation in Ferguson may have been calmer if the president went there to show his support. 'He didn’t have to go and take a side; all he needed to do was show his presence and everybody would have straightened up. But he didn’t go. I won’t fault him. He’s a man with a lot of weight on his shoulders, but I personally would have gone because being a “man of the people” means you’re right there with them in it. Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. led by example.' 'The new black': Pharrell previously caused controversy during an interview with Oprah earlier this year. In the interview he said 'the new black doesn't blame others races for our issues' Pharrell also made the strange decision to praise Bill Cosby during the interview, for the comedian's history preaching tough love to black youth. Cosby is currently under fire after several women have come forward to accuse the The Cosby Show star of rape. 'I agree with him. When Cosby said it back then, I understood; I got it. Listen, we have to look at ourselves and take action for ourselves. Cosby can talk that talk because he created Fat Albert, he tried to buy NBC, he portrayed a doctor on The Cosby Show and had all of us wearing Coogi sweaters. You’ve got to respect him,' Pharrell said.","The 'Happy' singer says the Ferguson, Missouri teen was acting 'bully-ish' before he was shot dead by a white police officer in August .

"Jose must not be the silent one . Jose Mourinho and I had our share of disagreements last season, and this is not me simply having another go at him, but it’s so frustrating when he doesn’t come out and talk after games. People say he is being clever and trying to turn the screw on referees. No he’s not. He’s in a panic because he had a bit of a rough spell and saw an eight-point lead over Manchester City disappear. There is certainly no campaign against Chelsea from the referees or the media. He wants to create an ‘us against the world’ mentality because he loves his teams to be the underdog. Unfortunately, he has a team that is ready to win the league. Jose Mourinho was charged by the FA for saying that there was a campaign against Chelsea . Chelsea beat Newcastle 2-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday and moved two points clear of Manchester City . The only people who suffer when Jose stays silent are the fans. They are the ones who adore him and want to know what he thinks of the game. If I was a player, I would be saying: ‘Come on gaffer, the fans want to hear from you.’ Sir Alex Ferguson did it when things were going badly but there are no excuses. I can’t imagine Roman Abramovich will be too happy either, with Jose painting the club in a negative light. The current managers, players, ex-players and members of the media - and I include myself in that - are lucky enough to work in an era when TV coverage has brought huge money into the game. Assistant manager Steve Holland stepped in for Mourinho at Chelsea's press conference on Friday . Manchester City managed to claw their way back level with Chelsea after an eight-point deficit . The Premier League has been good to everybody, so he should have a bit more respect for that. The least he can do is oblige the fans who want to hear from him. 13-14              14-15 .

Saido Berahino is in demand but Tony Pulis won’t want to let go of his only real match-winner. Berahino has started the past two campaigns on fire, but slowed in the second half of last season, as our table shows. This time he has six goals in three games in 2015. No wonder he was back celebrating again on Saturday. Saido Berahino took his goal tally in 2015 to six in just three matches with his winner against Hull . Berahino scored the winner for West Brom in their 1-0 victory over Hull at The Hawthorns on Saturday . New boss Tony Pulis got off to a winning start in the Premier League in his reign as West Brom manager . Burnley face a Danny dilemma . Burnley have a real predicament on their hands. Danny Ings is out of contract in six months and is a wanted man. Do the club sell him now and earn a quick buck or hang on and risk losing him for nothing in the summer? He is a fantastic young player and could be the difference between Burnley staying up or going down. He is a quality striker and, Chelsea or Manchester City apart, he could improve any side in this League. He has the work-rate, technique and the temperament to became a top player, and he took his goal against QPR so well. Danny Ings, pictured scoring against QPR, is out of contract with Burnley in the summer . With all respect to Burnley, he is destined for bigger things. The big question is when? Sean Dyche has a duty to get top money for him but if he helps keep Burnley in the top flight, that could be worth so much more. If they hang on to him now and he keeps them up, then he could happily move on in the summer knowing he leaves with the club’s blessing. Markovic is starting to make his mark . It’s been a stop-start season for Lazar Markovic, but he did well at Sunderland. It’s easy to forget he’s just 20 years old — the red card in the Champions League showed his immaturity — but now we are seeing the potential he has to become a top quality player. I love seeing players run with the ball with their head up and he does that brilliantly — like a young Steve McManaman. He cost £20million but he could prove to be a cheap signing in the long term. Lazar Markovic scored the winner for Liverpool in their victory over Sunderland on Saturday . The 20-year-old Serbian is starting to make his mark at Liverpool after a slow start following his £20m move . The price difference between Manchester United and Southampton's starting XIs. Koeman's coup . Louis van Gaal talks about three-year plans and needing time to build his squad, but he was taught a lesson on Sunday. Only five players on each side survived from the same fixture last year, so Ronald Koeman has had to rebuild his team just as much as Van Gaal. The only difference is he has done so with greater success and at a fraction of the cost. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal saw his team crash to a 1-0 defeat by Southampton on Sunday . United didn't register a single shot on target in their defeat by Southampton at Old Trafford . Alan's right at home . Anyone wondering why Alan Pardew changed clubs only had to look at Selhurst Park on Saturday. At Newcastle, the ‘Sack Pardew’ banners were on ice. At Palace, they would have carried him out of the ground if they could. Alan Pardew got off to a winning start in his reign as Crystal Palace manager against Tottenham . Jamie's Premier League number crunching . 1,945 - Leicester's winner against Villa was a long time coming for Paul Konchesky. The left back had not scored a Premier League goal for 1,945 days. On September 13, 2009, he scored the first for Fulham in a 2-1 win over Everton at Craven Cottage. Paul Konchesky scored the winner for Leicester in their victory over Aston Villa at the King Power Stadium . 13 - Maybe it was no surprise to see Alan Pardew’s Crystal Palace come from behind to beat Spurs. Pardew has won 13 points from losing positions this season, more than any other manager. 1964  - QPR are the first side to lose their opening 10 away games in the top flight since 1964. Sunderland were the last team to claim that dubious honour, though they recovered to finish 15th. QPR players were involved in angry exchanges with their fans after their 10th straight away league defeat . 13 - Given their reputation as a team of tough defenders, it’s surprising to see Stoke have conceded 13 goals from set- pieces, the most in the league. 45 - Leighton Baines's assist for Steven Naismith’s goal set a Premier League record for the most by a defender. Baines beat Graeme Le Saux’s record of 44. 0 - Manchester United failed to have a shot on target on Sunday. The last time that happened in the league at Old Trafford was against Arsenal in May 2009. That 0-0 draw won them the title. 8 - Liam Bridcutt’s red card for Sunderland means they have had eight players sent off since the start of last season. Only Newcastle with nine have received more reds in the same period. Maybe it’s a North-East thing!

"Shad Khan has dropped anchor again in London, but the Jacksonville Jaguars owner hopes it is his team who make a splash. Ever the showman, the 64-year-old tycoon moored his £70million super-yacht at Tower Bridge, and will watch the Jaguars face the Dallas Cowboys at Wembley. Playing the second of four regular season games, Khan was coy about extending the deal beyond 2016. Shad Khan made a cameo at Craven Cottage in midweek to watch Fulham's draw with Blackpool . 'I think we’re going to go through the two more years and then look at it. We are a party to a stakeholder. And whether this thing is extended the League has the final say, but it’s been great and in a couple of years we will look at it, but certainly it has worked out fabulously for the international fans. 'And really for the Jacksonville fans, it’s been great. Last year we had 5,000 fans travel over here from Jacksonville, which is a great experience for them.

"Chinese tourists have overtaken Germans as the world's biggest-spending travellers after a decade of robust growth in the number of Orientals holidaying abroad, it emerged today. Known for travelling in organised tours and snapping up luxury fashion abroad, they spent $102 billion on foreign trips last year, outstripping deep-pocketed travellers from Germany and the United States. Chinese tourists spent 41 per cent more on foreign travel in 2012 than the year before, beating the close to $84 billion both German and U.S. travellers parted with the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) said. Big spenders: Shoppers from China and the Far East scramble for bargains during the Christmas sales at Selfridges in London's Oxford Street. Chinese travellers spent an incredible $102bn on foreign trips last year . Tourists from other fast-growing economies with swelling middle classes, like Russia and Brazil, also increased spending in 2012. In recession-hit Europe, however, French and Italian tourists reined in their holiday budgets. 'The impressive growth of tourism expenditure from China and Russia reflects the entry into the tourism market of a growing middle class from these countries,' said UNWTO Secretary-General Taleb Rifai. The German Travel Association (DRV) said it was to be expected that the Chinese would eventually overtake Germans in terms of spending, given that the country had more inhabitants than North America, Russia and Europe put together. 'But that they have overtaken us already is astonishing,' DRV president Juergen Buechy said. The Chinese make more long-haul trips than Germans, who typically go to Mediterranean destinations, meaning that the average spend per holiday was greater, he added. Members of growing middle class: Wendy Ling and Sally Cheung from China (left) and Samantha Chan (right), from Hong Kong, show off their purchases on holiday in London last year . China is the world's fastest-growing tourist source market, thanks to higher disposable incomes in the world's number two economy and looser foreign travel restrictions. Chinese tourists made 83 million foreign trips in 2012, compared to 10 million in 2000. Hoteliers, tour companies, restaurants and even taxi drivers will need to brush up on their knowledge of Chinese cuisine, culture and language if they are to tempt them away from favourite destinations like Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Maldives, European tourism officials have said. Other countries in the top 10 including Japan and Australia posted growth in travel spending, though only Russia came close to China's huge growth, with a 32 per cent increase in holiday budgets. Russians are now the fifth highest-spending tourists, parting with $43 billion last year, according to the Madrid-based UNWTO, and catching up on the British, who spent $52 billion in 2012. Italian spending dipped by 1 per cent to $26 billion in 2012 and French tourists parted with $38 billion, a 6 per cent drop year-on-year. The two euro zone peers were the only countries in the top 10 outbound markets to post declines.","Oriental travellers spent 41% more abroad in 2012 than the year before .

Loretta Doyle Burroughs, 63, formerly of Ventnor, N.J., is charged with stabbing her husband to death and on Tuesday the round, gray-haired grandmother cried as she shuffled into an Atlantic County, N.J. courtroom  wearing an orange jumpsuit, handcuffs and leg irons. She rejected any plea bargains and Criminal Presiding Judge Michael Donio ordered her to stand trial next March, when a forensic anthropologist.will testify, due to the condition of the victim's remains. That is exactly what causes nightmares for the victim's grief-stricken half-brother, Raymond Wantorcik III, 56, of Glenolden, PA. Grisly: Loretta Doyle Burroughs, 63, formerly of Ventnor, N.J., is charged with stabbing her husband Daniel Burroughs to death seven years ago. Police discovered his dismembered remains packed into two plastic containers. She is being held on $2million bail and trial is set for March . Daniel Burroughs: Police discovered his dismembered remains packed into two plastic containers . Distraught: The victim's grief-stricken half-brother, Raymond Wantorcik III, 56, of Glenolden, Pa. appearing in court for the hearing. Before Tuesday's hearing began, Ray handed a flyer with a Photo shopped image of Loretta, bloody and wielding a knife, to her sister . 'Twenty-four seven, my mind is wrapped around what happened to my brother,' he tells MailOnline in an exclusive interview, struggling to contain his emotions. Because of his turmoil, Ray has been unable to work for five years. In fact, before Tuesday's hearing began, Ray gave in to his pain and frustration. He handed a flyer with a Photoshopped image of Loretta, bloody and wielding a knife, to the accused's sister. The grisly image expressed the nightmares that he suffers every day. Danny Burroughs was last seen in August 2007. He was riding his lawnmower at his home on Leipzig Avenue in Mays Landing, N.J. Danny had recently had rotator cuff surgery, so his arm was in a sling. Ray called his older brother to find out how he was feeling after the surgery. That's when his world was turned upside down. Loretta told Ray that her husband and 'upped and left her for another woman'. She said Danny climbed into a yellow Hummer with Florida tags and a younger woman inside. No plea: Loretta Burroughs appeared before Judge Michael Donio at the Atlantic County Criminal Courts Complex in Mays Landing, NJ, on Tuesday. She refused to take a plea deal . Body parts: The containers with Danny Burroughs' remains were discovered in a closet in this Ventnor, N.J. home . 'As soon as she told me my brother up and left I knew something was wrong,' Ray said. 'My brother and I were tight. We saw each other every weekend.' Danny lived on a two-acre property in Mays Landing, N.J., 15 miles outside of Atlantic City. He had a large garage behind the house and several sheds, where did custom auto work and refurbished roulette wheels for casinos. Danny shared the home with Loretta. They were high school sweethearts who had dated in the 1960s. In fact, their families were close, and when Ray was a young boy, Loretta was his babysitter. After high school, Danny and Loretta went their separate ways. They reconnected in the mid-1990s. A day after Loretta told him that Danny left for Florida, Ray went to his brother's home to talk to her. 'Five times I was in that house listening to her lies — and my brother could have been in the next room in a container rotting,' he shuddered. Ray said Loretta comes off as 'a mix of Martha Stewart and Julia Child', but he considers her to be a 'diabolical person'. Loretta changed the keypad code on the house so Ray couldn't get in, he said. And behind the shed was a huge mound of mothballs. When he asked Loretta about them, she said a groundhog got killed out there. Loretta quickly began selling and giving away her husband's belongings. One of the victim's friends said Loretta asked him if he wanted to buy anything, according to a video recorded by the Press of Atlantic City. The friend refused, and asked Loretta what she would do when Danny came back. Close: 'We were as tight as any brothers could be,' Ray explains. 'I spent every weekend with him. I lived in Philadelphia. When I would leave, I'd say, 'Okay, Dan, I'll see you next weekend.' 'She said he's not coming back,' the friend stated on the video. Robert Valiente Jr., another friend, said on the video that Danny was talking about selling the home and retiring to Florida. Loretta didn't agree. 'Behind his back, she was saying, ""Oh no, we're not. No we're not. I'm not going,'' Valiente said. Two weeks after Danny disappeared, on Labor Day Weekend of 2007, Ray and Bob Valiente Sr. filed a missing person report with the police in Hamilton Township, New Jersey. Ray repeatedly asked police to investigate Loretta. After all, she already had a criminal record. In March 1996, Loretta was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison for embezzling more than $480,000 from her employer, according to Philly.com. She was also ordered to pay $10,000 in restitution. Loretta worked for PLC Inc. in Yeadon, PA, for more than eight years. She began stealing from the company 'almost immediately after being hired,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert A. Zauzmer said at the time. Loretta forged the partners' signatures on checks and stole payments sent to the company. She stole an average of one check a week, ranging from $500 to $5,000, according to Philly.com. But the fact that Loretta was being prosecuted in Pennsylvania didn't change her behavior in New Jersey. Loretta was arrested by Hamilton Township, N.J., police and charged her with stealing money multiple times from her employer, Precision Auto Mall in Mays Landing, N.J. The crimes took place from May through December, 1995. Another woman? Loretta told Ray that her husband had left town with a younger women. Ray never believed it . According to court records, she pleaded guilty on March 20, 1996 — the day after she was sentenced in Pennsylvania. Loretta was ordered to pay $36,580 in restitution. So Ray begged the police to investigate Loretta, whom his brother had married after she got out of prison. 'For the first three years, the first detective said, 'Just because she's a liar doesn't mean she's a murderer,'' Ray said. Kathy Heinisch, a friend of Ray's from Folsom, N.J., described Loretta Burroughs as 'very convincing.' But, she said, 'The Loretta that most people meet is not the Loretta that truly is.' In February 2013, Ray again asked police to investigate. 'I was told that they couldn't give me the details, and just try to be patient,' Ray said. On May 17, 2013, police searched Loretta's new home, where they found Danny's remains in a closet. Loretta had moved at least twice, dragging the remains around with her. According to the Atlantic County Prosecutor, following her husband's disappearance, Loretta moved from Mays Landing to Ventnor. She was relocating again, to Villas in Cape May County, when she was arrested and charged with murder. 'She would not risk having the remains out of her line of sight,' Ray's friend, Kathy Heinisch, said. 'As long as there was no body, she could go on.' 'Nobody would listen to me,' Ray lamented. 'Nobody would believe me.' Obituary: 'Danny was a personality that many indeed loved and enjoyed being around. His animated, funny sense of humor and most of all, his willingness to stop what he was doing to help someone in need' Still, he was shocked and horrified when his brother's remains were found. 'I did not believe for an instant that my brother was on the property,' Ray said. 'I though he would have been in a landfill or a dump. I never thought he was in the house — and he was.' Now, Ray can't wait for his older brother's case to go to trial. 'I want a jury to see pictures of him,' Ray said. 'If the life sentence in New Jersey is 30 to 60 years, I want 60. I don't think it's too much to ask. For seven years, I've been kicking and fighting for him.' 'We were as tight as any brothers could be,' Ray continued. 'I spent every weekend with him. I lived in Philadelphia. When I would leave, I'd say, 'Okay, Dan, I'll see you next weekend.'' 'Dan would reply like it was chiseled in granite, 'I'll see you tomorrow.'' Dan's family and friends were finally able to have a memorial service for him last May, almost a year after his remains were discovered. 'Danny was a personality that many indeed loved and enjoyed being around,' his obituary stated. 'His animated, funny sense of humor and most of all, his willingness to 'stop what he was doing to help someone in need' seemed unparalleled. Dan was gifted and had the ability to fix or make just about anything … Dan and his younger brother shared many of the same interest, hobbies and were as close and loving as any two brothers could ever hope to be.' 'I'll never have closure,' Ray said. 'But I know what I need to hear from this court system.'

"The last rites for the FA’s doomed international committee are effectively being played out over the current week of England matches. The committee, who used to be responsible for running the England team as well as hiring and firing managers, are now barely carrying out their marginalised ambassador role. Instead of the three councillors who usually accompany the England team, there was only Wycombe’s Ivor Beeks with the senior side in Estonia. And none of the 12-strong committee have travelled with England’s Under 21s to Croatia for the second leg of their Euro 2015 qualifying play-off on Tuesday. Only one FA councillor watched England's 1-0 victory (thanks to Wayne Rooney) in Estonia on Sunday night . Even more farcically for the IC, who haven’t met since 2011, is that they were overhauled last summer to bring in club chief executives such as Arsenal’s Ivan Gazidis and Sunderland’s invisible Margaret Byrne, who haven’t the time or inclination to go on England trips. Meanwhile, some experienced blazers free of work pressures have been booted off international duties. Former IC stalwarts call the policy a ‘disgrace’, saying there will be long-term damage to the FA’s standing around the world if the meeting and greeting is abandoned. There has been concern expressed by England sponsors about agent Terry Byrne starting sports management agency Ten10 that represents Jack Wilshere, when he also oversees the 1966 operation looking after the combined commercial interests of the England squad. But Byrne says the FA have agreed his twin role and he would not jeopardise the relationships he has built up with agents over 20 years by attempting to sign their England players. Byrne adds the new agency is not just about football but attracting stars from other sports including rugby and golf. Jack Wilshere's agent Terry Byrne has dismissed fears of England sponsors . Liverpool's flying winger Raheem Sterling made a swift return from England duty after the win . The FA were saying before the Estonia match that there wasn’t a single incident last week of a club persuading a player to pull out of representing his country during an international round of fixtures involving games at senior, Under 21, U20, and U19 level. But that was before Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling said he was too tired to start against Estonia, for whatever reason. Fortunately the England team charter back from Tallinn stopped off first at Manchester to allow the North West players, including Sterling, the quickest journey home — although the flight arrangements were made before all the fuss kicked off about Raheem. 100m follow Ronaldo . Real Madrid galactico Cristiano Ronaldo, the sports darling of social media, will sometime today become the first athlete to have 100million Facebook followers. This puts him nearly 30m fans in front of Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, his rival for world No 1 footballer. The commercial power of Ronaldo, who also has 30.5m Twitter followers, was demonstrated when he posted six messages over two days advertising the Tag Heuer watch brand. These received 34.9m Facebook hits and 2.4m likes, valued at more than £300,000 by the watch company. Cristiano Ronaldo will celebrate reaching 100 million Facebook followers on Tuesday . Dan Ashworth, the FA’s director of elite development, has been effectively anointed the body’s new technical director by Greg Dyke. FA chairman Dyke said Ashworth, who has made his mark quickly since arriving from West Bromwich, would be filling that all-powerful role when explaining the new command structure for operating his England Commission grass-roots reforms. Brighton, whose owner Tony Bloom has ploughed more than £150million into the club, have been given the top rating of any team in the country for their academy, part of a new £30million training facility. No wonder Bloom is impatient for his go-ahead outfit to be doing far better than 19th in the Championship. Roy Keane will be on the panel at a sports writing festival at Lord’s . A sports writing festival at Lord’s partly organised by the MCC has footballer Roy Keane and his ghost writer Roddy Doyle on one of its guest panels a week on Saturday, but no booking for cricketer Kevin Pietersen, who was unavailable to talk about his new publication.","FA's doomed international committee are now barely carrying out their marginalised ambassador role .

"Pictures have emerged from the 'hen party' of Saddam Hussein's granddaughter, Banin. Her mother posted pictures of her enjoying a pre-wedding celebration on Instagram. Banin, whose mother is the former Iraqi dictator's eldest daughter, Raghad, enjoyed a traditional henna party on Thursday in Jordan before today's wedding to Badr Raad Mahmoud Nasser. Pictures have emerged from the 'hen party' of Saddam Hussein's granddaughter, Banin . Banin, whose mother is the former Iraqi dictator's eldest daughter, Raghad, enjoyed a traditional henna party on Thursday in Jordan before today's wedding to Badr Raad Mahmoud Nasser . Popular in the eastern Mediterranean, the Gulf states, India and Pakistan, they often involve the bridal party having intricate patterns drawn on their hands, and sometimes feet, by artists using dried henna leaves, while friends and relatives perform dance routines. She was pictured wearing a traditional dark pink Arab outfit with silver embroidery, Alarabiya.net reported, and hugging her future husband. Banin is seen signing her marriage contract in one picture, while another shows the wedding invite, which is in the shape of an eagle. The eagle was the state emblem of Iraq when Saddam was in power and is associated with pan-Arabism, an ideology that favours the unification of the countries of North Africa with those in West Asia and around the Arabian sea. It's a viewpoint that Saddam Hussein advocated throughout his rule from 1979 to 2003. The happy couple: Banin and her husband Badr Raad Mahmoud Nasser . Making if official: Banin signing the wedding contract . The wedding invite, which is in the shape of an eagle . He branded Banin's father, Hussein Kamel al-Majid, a traitor and had him killed in 1996 after he'd returned from exile in Jordan. The pictures emerged after former President George W. Bush said in a rare TV interview broadcast Sunday Morning that he was shocked to learn that Saddam Hussein expected him to back down from their 2003 standoff that preceded a massive U.S. invasion. 'You know, when he was captured, I was told that the FBI agent that talked to him – he said, 'I just didn't believe Bush',' he told CBS newsman Bob Schieffer Sunday morning. 'And it's hard for me to believe he didn't believe me.' 'We'd given an ultimatum to the Taliban and delivered,' Bush said. 'I make the point in the book, of course, that -- and Dad understood this better than anybody -- that when you say something as president, you better mean it.' That line is already being interpreted on Twitter and elsewhere as a veiled slap at President Barack Obama, whose 'red line' ultimatums leveled at Syria and Iran have been seen globally as tentative and toothless.","Banin Hussein's mum posted snaps of her pre-wedding party on the web .

"A family has adorned each of their Down Abbey-style country mansion's 52 rooms with a lavishly decorated Christmas tree... and it's taken a whole month. Paul Humpherston, 67, and his wife Victoria, 63, who own Abbey Cwm-Hir Hall have filled all their drawing rooms, bedrooms and even toilets with beautifully decorated trees to celebrate the festive season. And to do so, they had to close the Grade II* listed Abbey for an entire month to decorate each room in line with its own theme. One fashionable fir is covered in handbags and shoes and there's also a Royal Dalton tree covered in fine china and a crystal tree shimmering in Christmas lights. Scroll down for video .

'We have all 52 rooms decorated to individual themes and each room has at least one Christmas tree - but some have as many as four. We have 70 trees in total.

"A deer hunter is fearing for his life after he killed a rare albino buck in Missouri and posted photos of its corpse on Facebook, sparking outrage across the social network. Jerry Kinnaman himself has now become a target since slaying the animal with a bow and arrow on a friend's property in Cape Girardeau County as dawn broke on Tuesday. 'Not my biggest buck but at 7 1/2 years old he might be the oldest,' Kinnaman wrote on Facebook alongside pictures of the dead deer. 'Let the bashing begin!' But killing the deer, which was something of a local celebrity on account of its striking appearance, has sparked a frenzy of anger and even led to  death threats against him. Scroll down for video . Oh deer! Jerry Kinnaman killed the animal with a bow and arrow on a friend's property in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri, as dawn broke on Tuesday . 'People are all tough on the computer,' he told the Washington Post, 'but it's easy for them to say that because they know they're not going to get in trouble for it.' But he said he also understands why people are upset, adding: 'I was the same way as anybody else about this deer, so I understand the relationship some of these people have.' However, he claimed the ageing deer was  already in a poor state of health and would have died over the next few months anyway, adding that there was 'not an ounce of fat on him'. And on a Facebook post yesterday, he defended his actions: 'To all of you who have negative comments I say this: I know if you do not hunt it would be hard to for you to understand why I would take this animal. I knew that before I decided to harvest this animal. I can say this to you: first, after completely cleaning this animal I can tell you he had NO FAT on him for winter. 'He Was extremely skinny. He had Been shot before. And his teeth were almost gone. We documented all of this tonight. He would have died painfully this winter. 'I did NOT shoot this deer to sell nor did I poach it. I contacted MO Department of Conservation right when I harvested him. All of this is documented. I will see if our Nature Center will like to display him for everyone to see when I get him back. Good night.' Dead deer walking: However, he claimed the ageing deer was already in a poor state of health and would have died over the next few months anyway, adding that there was 'not an ounce of fat on him' Even though he killed the buck legally on land just north of Cape Girardeau's city limits, Kinnaman knew he would be pilloried for shooting it. Hunters who had the opportunity in recent years had passed it up out of affection for the beast, including Kinnaman himself. Albinism is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes. A condition known to affect all vertibrates, including humans, it is due to the absence or defect of tyrosinase, a copper-containing enzyme involved in the production of melanin. Experts say in deer the condition is so rare that albinos are only born once in about 100,000 births. The animals are typically identified by their pink nose and eyes – the result of blood vessels showing through the skin and clear lens of the eyes. Any white deer that lacks all color pigments are called 'true albinos.' 'I had a friend who let me hunt on his land a few years ago and I asked him, `Would you be offended if I shot this deer?' and he said yes because it was so beautiful, you know?,' Kinneman told the Southeast Missourian. But eventually, his friend changed his tune. 'He had people trespassing on his land (to see the deer) and it was getting to be too much of a hassle,' Kinnaman said. 'It got so bad that he came back to me and said, 'I want you to shoot this deer.' Kinnaman said the deer had been shot before, surviving wounds to the shoulder. 'I gave him a fair shot. He had a good life,' Kinnaman explained. 'He's famous. He still will be.' Kinnaman said he had the white deer on his mind as he took his bow to the woods before sunrise Tuesday. He spotted the buck on a ridge with two does and drew him closer by grunting like a rival male. 'He came up looking like a monster when I made that grunt,' he said. 'He came in ready to fight.' The first arrow glanced off a branch and just grazed the animal. Kinnaman lured it back using a doe call and, from 25 yards away, shot an arrow into its side. The buck ran about 30 yards before collapsing and dying. Missouri Department of Conservation deer biologist Jason Sumner said albino deer are more susceptible to predators because their white color makes them stand out.","Jerry Kinnaman shot deer with bow in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri .

"After a lightning-fast summer assault by ISIS that saw most of Iraq fall into their hands, the country's military is now fighting back and has won a string of symbolic victories. But while Iraq's leaders insist it is their army on the offensive, in reality the victories are being won by a powerful Iranian general - the 'fearless' Ghasem Soleimani. Refusing to wear a bullet-proof vest on the front lines, and with his motto 'death is the beginning of life, not the end', he has inspired Iraqi troops to victory where the government has failed. 'Fearless': While the Iraqi military has claimed a series of victories against ISIS in recent weeks, sources have attributed them to the Iranian general Ghasem Soleimani (pictured) who is said to be leading attacks . Inspiring: Soleimani (second right) was also said to have lead troops to victory in Amirli and Samarra with his motto 'death is the beginning of life, not the end' As ISIS militants retreated from the town of Jurf al-Sakher last week, relinquishing their hold for the first time since August, Soleimani was credited with the victory, according to military sources. Militia commanders said that dozens of advisers from Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard were on the front lines in Jurf al-Sakher. They said the men provided weapons training to some 7,000 Iraqi troops and militia fighters and coordinated with military commanders ahead of the operation. One commander, who agreed to be identified only by his nickname, Abu Zeinab, said Soleimani began planning the Jurf al-Sakher operation three months ago. In Amirli in August and in Samarra in June, top officials say Soleimani was on hand, pacing along with the Iraqi troops, and using his tactical abilities to drive the Islamic State militants back into the desert. A top Kurdish official even suggested that Soleimani and his crack Quds Revolutionary Guard force were on hand to help them defend their capital city Irbil from waves of ISIS fighters this summer. Iraqi military officials declined to discuss Soleimani's presence in Jurf al-Sakher, or in previous victories where he is known to have played a commanding role. There have also been reports that, fighting alongside Soleimani, troops from the Lebanese branch of Hezbollah have also been involved. Powerful Shiite militias have also sided with Soleimani and Hezbollah and have helped to drive Islamic State away from the so-called Baghdad belt - a ring of villages surrounding the Iraqi capital. Victorious: Iraqi federal policemen pose outside Jurf al-Sakhar after claiming victory against ISIS. While their government has been keen to take credit, military sources say it was Soleimani who led them into victory . Shiite forces: Fighting alongside Soleimani are said to be troops from Iran-back Hezbollah, and powerful Shiite militias, causing concern among the Sunni locals . This will come as good news to the Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, and the West, as they seek to rebuild Iraq's shattered army and build up their own national guard forces to strike against ISIS. However, the presence of strong Shiite forces - including Soleimani and Hezbollah - in the mostly Sunni villages around Baghdad is causing concern. There are fears of atrocities against the natives if the situation is not properly controlled, sparking a new wave of violence across the country. The Shiite militias have long been implicated in brutality against Sunnis, and their advance could also undermine efforts to knit the troubled country together. Their members were widely implicated in atrocities across the bloody years of 2006 and 2007, and have been accused of violence against Sunni captives in more recent times. While Iran-backed Hezbollah are openly fighting with Bashar al-Assad in Syria, the organisation will oonly admit to having 'advisers' in Iraq, breeding suspicion as to their intentions. In July, officials in Lebanon said a Hezbollah commander was killed while on a 'jihadi mission' in Iraq. Ibrahim Mohammed al-Haj was buried in Lebanon and his funeral attended by top Hezbollah officials. It was the first known Hezbollah death in Iraq since the lightning IS advance in June. A Lebanese official close to the group said Hezbollah is known to have 'a limited number of advisers' in Iraq who are not directly involved in fighting, and that al-Haj was one of them. Bloodshed: Shiite troops have long been implicated in violence against Sunni villagers, and have been accused of abducting and killing civilians in recent months as the Iraqi government watched on . Iraqi officials have also said that a handful of advisers from Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, are offering front-line guidance to Iraqi Shiite militias fighting Sunni extremists north of Baghdad. But it is not known if any Hezbollah men are actually fighting. These forces have benefited from Western airstrikes aimed at weakening ISIS forces on the ground. With Iraq's military still licking its wounds from a summer of heavy defeats, many fear this has created a power vacuum for the Shiite forces to move into. Amnesty International said last month that militias have abducted and killed scores of Sunni civilians with the tacit support of the Iraqi government in retaliation for Islamic State attacks. Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has pledged to reign in the militias and establish a national guard to mobilize Sunnis against the extremists. But it could take months to assemble such a force, and in the meantime Soleimani's militias are the best placed to aid Iraq's beleaguered military in regaining the initiative against the Islamic State group. Iran and Iraq both have a majority Shiite population - though Sunnis are more widely spread in Iraq - and have a troubled history. Under the leadership of Saddam Hussein Iraq went to war with Iran in wake of the Iranian revolution in 1979. The bloody conflict lasted eight years, included the use of chemical weapons, and ended in a stalemate.","Ghasem Soleimani has been leading troops in Iraq to victories against ISIS .

"Louis van Gaal has revealed his New Year's resolution is to make Manchester United the top team in the country by the end of 2015 but acknowledges they will have to improve their away form for that to happen. United travel to League One Yeovil in a potential FA Cup banana skin on Sunday and while the club are on a 10-match unbeaten run, they have only drawn their last three away games at Stoke, Tottenham and Aston Villa. Van Gaal, who saw his side embarrassingly dumped out of the Capital One Cup 4-0 at MK Dons, is taking no chances with the trip to Huish Park and has had Gary Johnson's underdogs watched three times by his scouting team. VIDEO Scroll down to see Louis van Gaal recall his biggest cupsets as a manager . Louis van Gaal wants to lead Manchester United to the top of the Premier League table by the end of 2015 . United drew for the third successive away game against Stoke on New Year's Day . Stoke 1-1 Manchester United - Jan 1 . Tottenham 0-0 Manchester United - Dec 28 . Aston Villa 1-1 Manchester United - Dec 20 . But ambitions for his first full calendar year at Old Trafford are far grander. Having spent £150million on star names like Angel di Maria, Falcao Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo in the summer and six months in which to impose his philosophy on the club, van Gaal thinks overtaking Chelsea and Manchester City has to be the target. '2014 was very exciting for me and my players. I hope we can continue and for the fans we are number one in the league at the end of this year,' he proclaimed. 'You always want that perfect game as a manager and so we need to improve the process and our performances. You saw at Stoke we didn't play the perfect game, we started very badly and lost two points away. We have to improve that because otherwise you can not be champions.' Ryan Shawcross scored against his former club to give Stoke an early lead at the Britannia . Louis van Gaal's side are nine points adrift of City and Chelsea after the first game of 2015 . Shinji Kagawa, Michael Keane, Danny Welbeck and Nick Powell were either sold or sent out on loan within a week of the MK Dons debacle and van Gaal promises there will be no similar capitulation this time, even if he reshuffles his pack after four matches in 10 days, and drafts in young defenders Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair. 'I can say that in general my players always fight to the end. We showed against Stoke City we had the team spirit to fight back and try and get a victory despite a very horrible start,' he vowed. 'It is more difficult to prepare for Yeovil than a Premier League team but we have had them watched and analysed because we are professionals and have to prepare games like professionals, because we know it will not be easy. It is a matter of you win or you are dead.' Van Gaal admits that United must improve their away form if they are to topple Manchester City and Chelsea . Radamel Falcao equalised for the visitors as United lost further ground on City . How United and Yeovil compare ahead of FA Cup third round tie at Huish Park on Sunday . Manchester United haven't won the FA Cup for 11 years and Darren Fletcher is the only survivor of the 2004 team that beat Millwall in the final, though Robin van Persie and Juan Mata have won the trophy for other clubs. Twice, United have needed replays to beat non-league opposition Burton Albion and Exeter City and only scraped past another Conference side Crawley Town 1-0 in 2011. Defender Phil Jones says the fact the majority of players including Wayne Rooney and himself have not won the FA Cup raises the importance of Sunday's trip to Huish Park. 'We all want to play because it's a game we want to win and progress in. The FA Cup is going to be a big competition for us this season.We are not in the Champions League so there is even more of an expectation to go and put a performance on at Yeovil,' he said. Phil Jones has emphasised the importance of the FA Cup ahead of the third round clash . 'It won't be an easy game down there. We know that. People might think we will go there and walk all over Yeovil but it won't be like that at all. 'League form doesn't matter and what happened against MK Dons is a reminder to us. We can't let that happen again.' 'I didn't play that game, I was at home watching on TV. It was very disappointing watching it, we have to make sure there is no repeat. 'The FA Cup is a massive competition especially for the British lads in the squad growing up watching the FA Cup draw and the games.'","Louis van Gaal wants to end 2015 with Man United top of the league .

"A NSW social worker who repeatedly raped a young girl deliberately removed two moles from his penis in a failed bid to cover his tracks, a court has heard. His victim, who he began abusing when she was nine, told police about the marks when his crimes came to light in November 2012. But Sydney's Downing Centre District Court heard on Friday that the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, refused to let officers see his penis. The abuse has ruined the girl's life and left her feeling 'ashamed and sick', the court has heard . When they later obtained an order for a compulsory forensic examination it was found there were lesions on it which indicated he had deliberately removed the moles by burning or cutting them off. 'This demonstrated a consciousness of guilt,' prosecutors said. The man, from the Hunter region, was found guilty of five counts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 and three of assault with an act of indecency with a child following a trial in August. The abuse has ruined the girl's life and left her feeling 'ashamed and sick', according to a victim impact statement read out to the court during Friday's sentencing hearing. 'I hate this person for what he did. The pain that he put me through, it is unbearable. 'I don't know how I will ever get over this,' the statement said. The man was found guilty of five counts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 . The court heard the man has shown no remorse and continues to deny anything happened. His defence lawyer, David Barrow, told the judge his offending was not of the most serious kind as the man did not abuse the girl in his capacity as a DoCs worker who cared for 'very vulnerable children'. But prosecutor Peter McGrath said he had nevertheless abused his position of trust. The court heard he had not committed any offences of a sexual nature before and was being supported by his family. Sentencing was adjourned until February 13. The victim, who the man began abusing when she was nine, told police about the marks on his genitals .

"When Nicola Cortese left Southampton in January some of the players took to social media to express their disappointment. The departure of some of those players seemed inevitable. Similarly, Mauricio Pochettino’s exit was a certainty and sure enough that happened. Saints have been a success story since Alan Pardew left them at the wrong end of League One just over four years ago. So for a well-loved chief executive, a manager, and so many good players to leave the club in the space of a few months constituted a meltdown. My main philosophy in life has been applied by Southampton Football Cllub. It’s not the setbacks that are important – it’s how you respond to them. Victor Wanyama (centre) is congratulated by his Southampton team-mates after scoring against Swansea . Southampton manager Ronald Koeman (second left) watches his side beat Swansea 1-0 at the Liberty . And the response at St Mary’s has been brilliant. They paid a huge amount for Fraser Forster, but he has set about the task of proving himself in the Premier League superbly. Money spent on Graziano Pelle and Dusan Tadic reflects well on the club’s scouting system, the appointment of Ronald Koeman isn’t the cheap anonymous option some clubs take, and there is still a commitment to youth – academy product James Ward-Prowse has featured in every game this season, while fellow youngsters Matt Targett and Sam McQueen were on the bench on Saturday. Quietly, with zero spotlight on her, Southampton owner Katharina Liebherr has gone about the business of continuing her late father’s commitment to the club. Southampton owner Katharina Liebherr has the final say on everything that happens at the club . Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski can only look on as Wanyama scores to put Southampton ahead . Southampton's Steven Davis celebrates with Wanyama after the final whistle on Saturday . The Southampton FC website states that she is the ultimate controlling party of St Mary’s Football Group Ltd. In other words Ms Liebherr has the final say on everything that happens at the club. She has sailed them through the choppy waters of massive change and led them out the other side. So far so good for Saints, let’s see how the season works out. In an era of egomaniacs buying football clubs, picking teams for managers, and earning a fortune out of our clubs, Katharina Liebherr deserves a huge amount of credit. She’s not only preserving the legacy of her father, she is making a lot of Southampton fans very happy. Not bad for a lady who reportedly doesn’t have a great passion for football.","The response at St Mary's to the summer's outgoings has been brilliant .

"The Queen has vowed to attend the Remembrance Day centenary ceremony at The Cenotaph despite police arresting four Islamist terror suspects plotting to kill her on the day. The 88-year-old monarch insisted she will carry on with tradition - laying the first wreath following the two-minute silence at 11am on November 11. A source told the Sun: 'Whatever the security assessment, Her Majesty would not shirk from her responsibility and duty - and this Remembrance Sunday is no different.' Scroll down for video . Terror raids: Four men have been arrested in a series of terror raids, including one  here in High Wycombe, Bucks, amid fears . Target: The Queen has vowed to attend the Remembrance Day centenary ceremony at The Cenotaph despite police arresting four Islamist terror suspects plotting to kill her on the day . The Queen's tribute will be followed as normal by salutes from Prime Minister David Cameron, Cabinet members and Opposition leaders. Yesterday armed officers seized the four men, aged 19 to 27, following months of surveillance. Last night police were said to be interrogating the suspects - who are thought to have hatched a plot assassinate the Queen with a knife. Police had already stepped up security after a terrorist shot a soldier guarding a war memorial at Canada’s parliament. A police officer guards this property in Desborough Avenue, where a neighbour said officers were searching a shed. The timing of the raids raised fears of a Remembrance Day outrage . A ring of steel will be thrown around Whitehall today as the Queen leads events at the Cenotaph marking the centenary of the start of the First World War. Although police would not discuss whether the suspects had a specific target, the timing of the raids raised fears of a Remembrance Day outrage. Islamic State militants have called on ‘self-starter’ followers to target high-profile commemorative events. Police marksmen from its SO15 terrorism command arrested the youngest suspect on Thursday night at 8.31pm at the £160,000 home he shares with his mother in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. He is said to have recently returned from Pakistan. Fourteen minutes later a 22-year-old was seized by armed officers at a house in Hounslow. A ring of steel will be thrown around Whitehall tomorrow as the Queen leads events at the Cenotaph to mark the centenary of the start of the First World War . In an unusual move, the eldest suspect was stopped at gunpoint in his car in Southall, West London, but no shots were fired. The fourth man was arrested in Uxbridge and searches were taking place in Greenford and Hayes, also in West London. The suspects were all arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. It was reported the allegations are linked to a UK plot - not travelling to Syria to join ISIS. The use of armed officers for the arrests suggests police chiefs fear the suspects may have acquired weapons. None were found, however. The Metropolitan Police said the operation involved its counter-terrorism command, MI5 agents and officers from other constabularies. The home of Yousaf Syed, the 19-year-old suspect, had been raided before – in April during an investigation into potential jihadists. Another man arrested in that operation complained his passport was seized by the Home Office to stop him travelling to the Middle East. Neighbours of Syed said he lives with his 41-year-old mother Somia, who works as ground crew for an airline. One said he had had ‘several run-ins’ with the ‘angry’ teenager. When he challenged the teenager’s mother, she told him: ‘I’m sorry, it’s my son. He’s young and he’s just discovered his faith.’ The neighbour said the teenager recently grew a full beard and began wearing traditional Muslim dress. Another local resident said: 'It's a big shock to hear what he's been accused of.' Officers were said to have removed items from the garden shed as forensic officers combed the house and garden. Today two police officers wearing high visibility jackets were posted outside the brown wooden front door of the brick terraced house in Desborough Avenue, near the town centre. A cordon of police tape was placed around the brick driveway to the home, on which a police patrol car was also parked. All the curtains were closed at the terraced house where police forensic staff were combing the home and garden for clues while neighbours stood in the street and watched. The neighbour said that he saw a woman, the teenager, a man aged in his 20s along with two small children regularly coming and going from the address. He said that he had been out when the raid took place early this morning and that he arrived back at his home to find officers removing items from the family's shed. Two other addresses in the town were being searched, including a rented flat and a £300,000 house apparently occupied by Syed’s aunt. High Wycombe’s remembrance parade is due to take place at 10.30am tomorrow in the high street before proceeding to All Saints’ Church. It attracts large crowds, in part due to the proximity of the town to RAF High Wycombe in nearby Naphill. A large contingent of personnel from the base, which is the home of the RAF’s Headquarters Air Command, traditionally marches with veterans and other community groups. Investigation: These officers were guarding the front door of this High Wycombe house while forensics worked inside . Germaine Lindsay, who killed 26 people when he detonated a bomb on the Piccadilly Line in the 7/7 attacks, has links to High Wycombe. There are growing concerns that British jihadists fighting in Syria and Iraq will return to this country and carry out acts of terrorism. But detectives do not believe there is any direct link between the latest arrests and fanatics in the Middle East. David Cameron ordered a security review last month after the Canadian attack. Heads of MI5 and Scotland Yard held talks over the terror threat to Parliament and other landmarks in central London. Just a few weeks ago police were warned to be on their guard over fears they could become targets. Raids: Scotland Yard said that they have arrested four young men in a series of raids linked to an alleged Islamist terror plot . In London, frontline officers were warned of intelligence that suggested terrorists aspired to abduct and murder a policeman. In August the national terror-threat level was raised from substantial to severe, meaning a terrorist attack was ‘highly likely’. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the men were being held on suspicion of ‘being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism’. He said the arrests were part of an ongoing investigation by the Met’s counter terrorism command, colleagues from other forces and MI5. He added: ‘They have all been taken to police stations in central London and remain in custody. Two of the entries to premises were assisted by firearms officers. No shots were fired.’ On Remembrance Sunday in 1987, 11 people were killed and 68 wounded when the IRA bombed the cenotaph in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. This year’s Armistice Day will be used to mark the centenary of the start of the First World War and the withdrawal of British troops from Afghanistan.

"Jack Wilshere says England's humiliating early World Cup exit has been 'consigned to history' as they continue their road to recovery. Less than four months have passed since Roy Hodgson's men trudged back from Brazil with the worst record of any England side to appear at the finals. England were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1958, with a record of two losses and a draw seeing them end up with their lowest-ever World Cup points tally. Jack Wilshere was England's best player against Estonia as he ran the game from  midfield in Tallinn . The Arsenal playmaker says England have put their disappointing World Cup run behind them . Uncomfortable questions continue over that failure but those involved in the national set-up are only interested in the future, with a fourth straight win in Estonia on Sunday - making it three wins out of three in the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign - helping that healing process. 'It is credit to the manager and his coaching staff that the World Cup is consigned to history,' England midfielder Wilshere said. 'The first meet-up after the World Cup, we went through it and that was it. 'Maybe the game against Switzerland (a 2-0 win in Basle last month) helped where people didn't expect us to do much but we went there and showed we have still got the quality that is required for this level. 'We have pushed on from that game now and we are looking forward. We are taking each game as it comes and we'll look forward to the next ones.' Wilshere played in England's group matches against Costa Rica and Italy at the World Cup . The Three Lions were dumped out of the tornament early in Brazil after losing their first two matches . The 1-0 win in Tallinn was harder work than it should have been, with Estonia - ranked 81st in the world - reduced to 10 men for the majority of the second half. England were wasteful in front of goal and Wilshere knows he should have opened the scoring before a Wayne Rooney free-kick maintained their 100 per cent start to qualification. 'We are happy with the win but we are happy with the performance as well, especially in the first half,' the Arsenal midfielder said. 'We dominated the game, we stayed on top of them. We knew it wasn't going to be as easy as San Marino (who England beat 5-0 last Thursday). This is a well-organised team. 'We were away from home on a different pitch to what we are used to, but I thought we did well. 'We created chances,  and we probably should have scored a few more but we are happy with the win.' Wilshere was quick to praise game-changing captain Rooney afterwards, with his 74th-minute set-piece making up for his other missed chances at the A. Le Coq Arena. 'That's the sign of a world-class player,' he said. 'He had a few opportunities but when it comes to those sorts of moments of magic, he can produce them. Wilshere praised Wayne Rooney after the England captain scored England's winner against Estonia . 'He has done it throughout his England and Manchester United career. He has still got it and we are lucky to have him.' Rooney may have got the goal and Joe Hart again voted fans' man of the match, but Wilshere was the stand-out player on a cold night in the Baltic state. Again deployed at the base of the diamond, the 22-year-old broke-up the play as well as providing an attacking outlet - all part of the 4-4-2 diamond which helps England to become a 'horrible team to play against'. The 22-year-old says he is getting used to playing in a deeper role for England and is improving every game . 'I said after the Switzerland game I am only going to get better in this role,' Wilshere said. 'It is a little bit difficult because I don't play it for my club. 'I am used to playing a different role but that's what I spoke about after the Switzerland game, doing your homework, watching players who play in that role and learning from them. 'I am feeling better and better as each game goes on. I am starting to get a little bit of an understanding with Wayne and his runs. If he keeps making those runs, he is going to beat the goal record.' Rooney took his senior international tally to 43 on Sunday evening, one behind third-placed Jimmy Greaves in the all-time England goalscorers list.","Jack Wilshere shone for England in Sunday's 1-0 win against Estonia .

"The chilling sight of the Islamic State's black jihadist flag is still visible in  Kobane - despite Kurdish territorial gains and  weeks of sustained airstrikes by American and Arab warplanes. The terrorist group was thought to have been pushed out of the centre of the besieged Syrian city after hundreds of brave Kurdish resistance fighters coordinated fierce street battles with coalition bombing raids - forcing the well-equipped jihadis to retreat into the outskirts of Kobane. But this morning the group's black jihadist flag could clearly still be seen inside city, raised over a multi-storey building just a few hundred feet away from where the yellow, triangular flag of the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) could be seen fluttering above a largely destroyed housing complex. The image emerged as American and Arab jets launched fresh attacks on ISIS positions in the north of Kobane - with pyrotechnic tracer ammunition lighting up the night sky and coalition warplanes destroying ISIS-held buildings with a barrage of air-to-surface missiles. Chilling: ISIS' black jihadist flag (background) was still visible in Kobane this morning - despite Kurdish territorial gains and weeks of sustained airstrikes by American and Arab warplanes.

Smoke and dust is seen rising over the Syrian town of Kobane after U.S. warplanes carry out a bombing raid on Islamic State targets . Tracer rounds crossed the sky over the Syrian town of Kobane last night as American warplanes continued to hit Islamic State targets . The chilling image of the ISIS flag still flying in Kobane emerged as lawmakers in Iraq's largely autonomous Kurdish region authorized peshmerga forces to cross into neighboring Syria to help fellow Kurds combat Islamic State militants in the city, providing much-needed boots on the ground. The unprecedented deployment will almost certainly depend on the support of Turkey, whose president criticized a U.S. airdrop of arms to Kurdish fighters after some of the weapons wound up in the hands of the extremists. Turkey, which has riled Kurdish leaders and frustrated Washington by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into Kobane, said this week it would help Iraqi Kurdish fighters cross into Syria to help their brethren against the militants, who also are being attacked by a U.S.-led campaign of airstrikes. But it is not clear how many fighters will be allowed in or whether they will be allowed to carry enough weapons to make an impact. The Kurds of Syria and Iraq have become a major focal point in the war against the Islamic State group, with Kurdish populations in both countries coming under significant threat by the militants' lightning advance. Lt. Gen. Frederick Hodges, the outgoing commander of NATO's Land Command in Izmir, Turkey, said the Turks have agreed to open up 'a land bridge of sorts' so that the peshmerga can get into Kobane to help with the fighting there. 'It seems to me that between the United States, Turkey and other countries, they are figuring out what is permissible to make sure that ISIL is not successful and that it is something that Turkey can live with,' he added, using an acronym for the group. A warplane is seen flying over Kobane last night during another evening of sustained airstrikes on Islamic State targets . A huge cloud of smoke is seen in Kobane following an airstrike. Neighbouring Turkey, which has riled Kurdish leaders and frustrated Washington by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into Kobane, said this week it would help Iraqi Kurdish fighters cross into Syria .

Turkish tanks and armoured vehicles hold their positions as they watch the Syrian town of Kobane from near the Turkish-Syrian border . A Kurdish fighters' position is seen in the outskirts of the besieged Syrian town of Kobane this afternoon . Anwar Muslim, a Kobane-based senior Kurdish official, praised the parliament's decision, saying 'all help is welcome.' He said there seemed to be a solidifying international push to help Kobane combat the militants. 'The next days will show the seriousness' of the Turks, he said. In August, Syrian and Iraqi Kurds took part in cross-border operations to help rescue tens of thousands of displaced people from the Yazidi minority group under threat by the IS militants in Iraq's Sinjar Mountains. The fight in Kobane has also grabbed the world's attention and raised sympathy for the outgunned Kurds. The overwhelming vote in the Kurdish parliament to send fighters to Kobane underscored growing cooperation between Kurds in these countries and marked a first mission for the peshmerga outside Iraq. Hoshyar Zebari, a Kurdish politician and Iraq's long-serving foreign minister, told Al-Arabiya TV the decision was 'part of an understanding' reached between Kurdish, Turkish and U.S. officials to provide military aid to Kobane. 'This is a big turning point in Kurdish history,' said Youssef Mohammed, the speaker of parliament. 'Troops used to be sent to occupy Kurdish lands, but now we are sending soldiers to protect our Kurdish brothers abroad,' he said. There were few details about the fighting force, however, and Kurdish officials said they would be worked out later.

A  drone aircraft is seen flying over Kobane yesterday evening as fierce fighting between ISIS and Kurdish forces broke out once again . Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the United States made a mistake in airdropping weapons to Kurdish fighters in Kobane earlier this week because some of the weapons ended up in IS hands. 'It turns out that what was done was wrong,' he said, according to Turkey's private Dogan news agency. The Turkish government is reluctant to aid the Syrian Kurdish forces - the People's Protection Units, or YPG - because it views them as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has waged a 30-year insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and NATO. The Pentagon confirmed that IS militants were able to seize one of the 28 bundles of weapons and medical supplies intended for Kurdish fighters. Turkey's decision to give Kurds passage to fight in Syria marked a shift in position, even though Ankara in recent years has built friendly ties with the leadership of the largely autonomous Iraqi Kurdish region. Peshmerga spokesman Halgurd Hekmat in Irbil said there is still a lot of uncertainty on the details of the deployment, including how many forces will be sent and when. 'We're sending the peshmerga, not to become YPG but to fight alongside the YPG,' Hekmat said. 'We will send the peshmerga to do their job for as long as they're needed and to come back after that.' Hekmat said Iraqi forces will also provide weapons, but he did not say what kind. After two terrorist attacks in Canada in a week left two Canadian soldiers dead, ISIS has stepped up its rhetoric calling for even more radicals to carry out mass murder and mayhem in the country. An even more horrifying fact is that an estimated 130 Muslim youths in Canada have been seduced and radicalized by ISIS and have even left Canada behind to join forces with them. The first attack happened Monday night -  a hit-and-run by suspected jihadist Martin Rouleau. The second strike was carried out by a gunman on Wendesday on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. One of the shooters, Canadian national Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was shot dead, reports Insite Blog. Ever since Canada announced their involvement in the coalition against ISIS, jihadist supporters have taken to Twitter to call for 'justice' in the hopes to shake the country's nerves by instilling fear and terror.

"Roy Keane was involved in a training-ground row with Aston Villa players 24 hours before his sudden exit from the club. Keane left Villa Park after five months as Paul Lambert’s assistant on Friday claiming he could no longer combine the job with his role as No 2 to Republic of Ireland boss Martin O’Neill. But Sportsmail understands that tensions between Keane and several senior players have been simmering for some time. A club insider said there was a bust-up at their Bodymoor Heath training ground on Thursday which began during the session and is thought to have continued afterwards. Roy Keane  left his role as assistant manager at Aston Villa after a training ground row . Keane joined Aston Villa in July to work alongside Scotsman Paul Lambert . Keane has left Aston Villa after just 11 Premier League games assisting Lambert . Keane is reported to have fallen out with several senior players in Lambert's squad . Keane had been working as No 2 at both the Republic of Ireland and Aston Villa . July 1 2014 - Roy Keane joined Aston Villa as assistant to Paul Lambert . August 16 - Aston Villa beat Stoke 1-0 in the first game of the season . September 13 - Villa beat Liverpool 1-0 at Anfield . November 24 - Aston Villa's 1-1 draw with Southampton is their eighth game without a win (L6, D2) November 28 - Roy Keane quits Villa . Keane and Lambert are said to have held talks later in the day and come to an amicable decision that it was better for the 43-year-old former Manchester United star to leave. The Villa players were informed of Keane’s exit by text message shortly before the club issued a statement. The official reason that Keane was leaving to focus on his international commitments has been questioned in some quarters because Ireland do not play again until March. His relationship with several players is said to have become strained with Keane struggling to accept what he felt was a lack of intensity in training. Joe Cole (left) celebrates putting Aston Villa 1-0 up at Burnley on Saturday . Ings’s fourth goal in five games means that he has scored more times than the whole Aston Villa team since the start of October. Keane left Ireland’s World Cup camp in Saipan in 2002 in a row over training facilities, and departed United shortly after a similar falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson and Carlos Queiroz on a pre-season trip to Portugal three years later. When contacted on Sunday night, Villa denied reports of the bust-up or that there was any issue between senior players and Keane, but questions about the Irishman were banned in the press conference after Saturday’s draw at Burnley. Joe Cole scored his first goal for Villa at Turf Moor. The former England and Chelsea player turned down lucrative offers from abroad and took a pay cut to move to Villa Park on a free transfer from West Ham in the summer. Burnley's Danny Ings celebrates after he scores the equalising goal on Saturday . ‘This is what it’s all about, playing in the Premier League,’ he said. ‘I could have gone and filled my pockets, but the fire still burns for me.’ Danny Ings equalised for Burnley with a late penalty.

"France's Romain Wattel will take a three-shot lead into the final round of the KLM Open on Sunday as he seeks his first European Tour title. Wattel, mentioned as a potential future Ryder Cup player by European captain Paul McGinley last week, carded seven birdies and one bogey in a third round of 64 to finish 14 under par at Kennemer Golf Club. Scotland's Richie Ramsay, who won a year's supply of beer for a hole-in-one on Friday, is his nearest challenger on 11 under after a 65, with England's Paul Casey another shot back after equalling the day-old course record with a 62. Romain Wattel leads the KLM Open by three shots after a round of 64 on Saturday . Wattel has been earmarked as a potential star since winning on the Challenge Tour as a 19-year-old amateur in 2010, but told European Tour Radio: 'I'm not really affected to be honest. I know if I play good enough I am going to win one day; maybe it's going to be tomorrow, maybe it's going to be in two years, I don't really know. 'The most important thing for me is to play some good golf. I am not in the top 100 in the world (he is currently 125th) so I can't play the best tournaments like the majors and WGC events, so I am just trying to improve my game week after week. 'I am confident and even if I don't win tomorrow it's not a big deal, it will have been a good week for me and I am going to try to keep doing exactly the same.' Ramsay, who held the halfway lead in the Omega European Masters last week before fading to eighth place, said: 'My attitude pleased me today. I nearly got a hole-in-one on 11 again. It was playing tough, a front pin and it was a seven iron to four feet, so three shots in two days on the hole is a good effort. 'I've been working on the mental side and being a bit more patient, and I've worked on the short irons. I was making too many mistakes. I've started making birdies now. It was a small change but it has worked. 'I'm in a lovely position. The golf course played great again. It's getting bouncy and favours shotmakers. I need the same attitude tomorrow, so I'm hoping to go out and enjoy it as you don't get this sort of opportunity all the time.' Casey had the chance to celebrate the recent birth of his first child by carding the first ever 59 on the European Tour, the former world number three carding nine birdies in his first 16 holes after starting from the 10th. Paul Casey equalled the course record and sits in the group chasing the young Frenchman . A par on the eighth left Casey needing to eagle the ninth to create history and he was only a fraction away as his ball pitched close to the pin and span back to miss the hole by a few inches. Unfortunately the spin then carried the ball off the green and led to a first bogey of the day, but Casey had no complaints after matching Pablo Larrazabal's course record from Friday and moving into contention for a first win of the season. 'I actually wasn't thinking about what I was shooting, but apparently came quite close to shooting a 59 on the last,' the 37-year-old said. 'The disappointment was making a bogey on the last, not in missing out on a 59. I'm just happy I'm playing some good stuff. 'Becoming a father just a few days ago, I'll be honest and say this probably isn't the most important thing right now and isn't my immediate focus, or all of my focus. Pablo Larrazabal of Spain hits his second shot from the rough on the eighth hole . 'There have been times the last few days I would rather have been at home, but although I will be committed tomorrow, I will maintain that carefree attitude. Whether I win this golf tournament or not, I'll get to go home to my new baby.' Larrazabal started the day two clear of the field and appeared to be making serene progress as he followed six pars with a birdie at the long seventh. However, an errant tee shot at the short eighth found thick rough and led to a quadruple-bogey seven, the Spaniard eventually signing for a 75 to fall nine shots off the lead.","Wattel hits 64 in third round and is closing in on maiden title .

"Martin O'Neill circled the wagons around Roy Keane, insisting his assistant manager was fully entitled to speak his own mind. ‘He (Keane) has got a mind of his own, he can say what he wants,’ said O’Neill in defence of Keane, who claimed Everton were bringing pressure to bear on their Irish players around internationals. Keane has generated more headlines than O’Neill in the past 13 months with his words and actions, but a terse O’Neill is publicly backing his No 2. Roy Keane is concerned that Everton are putting pressure on players to pull out of international duty . ‘Every single time that you mention Roy, it either seems to be a distraction or another issue. Let me tell you straight: I’m delighted to have him,’ he said. ‘Unless what he says is absolutely and utterly in contradiction with what I am saying to you, then I do not have a problem with it. It is not an issue,’ said O’Neill. The Irish manager said he wasn’t aware of Keane’s provocative Sunday comments, nor was he briefed about the reply by Bill Kenwright, the Everton chairman, to Keane’s allegations. ‘I’m a big fan of Roy Keane’s but he does say some stupid things,’ said Kenwright. ‘That is just totally, totally unfair, we absolutely love our players going on international duty and we never ever get in the way of them and Roberto Martinez will be as shocked as everyone at Everton.’ Bill Kenwright (left) said that Everton never stand in the way of their players' international committments . Seamus Coleman (right) missed Ireland's match against Germany last month, but was deemed fit for Everton . O’Neill said he would reflect on the Keane and Kenwright comments before ‘taking a view’ on things. The Everton episode aside, O’Neill shares Keane’s stance on the Jack Grealish pursuit. ‘I don’t need Roy Keane to tell me — but I’m not going to go and chase him (Grealish), I am not chasing him, said O’Neill. ‘The situation is there for everyone. I have spoken to Jack Grealish’s father, I have spoken to Jack Grealish and it’s really up to them.’ On Monday night, the Aston Villa winger tweeted, ‘Whatever you do whether it’s posting tweet or making a life changing decision your (sic) going to get judged, so at the end of the day do what makes you and your loved ones happy.’ Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"Reverend Al Sharpton delivered an impassioned sermon to a packed St Louis church, in which he warned prosecutors that 'the fight is not over' and 'justice will come to Ferguson'. As Michael Brown's parents sat in the front row of the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist, Sharpton told a congregation of around 2,500 that Darren Wilson's resignation was a distraction from the family's quest for justice. But he claimed he found bits of evidence in the grand jury transcript that might help the cause of those who think the failure to indict Wilson over the shooting of 18-year-old Michael was a mistake. Scroll down for video . Reverend Al Sharpton told a congregation of several hundred at that Darren Wilson's resignation was a distraction from the family's quest for justice . 'All you've got to do is read the transcript,' Sharpton said. 'Better yet, let a federal grand jury read the transcript.' Addressing his comments at Robert P McCulloch, Prosecuting Attorney for St. Louis County, Sharpton warned that the battle would continue, and people would continue to march and protest. 'We lost the round, but the fight ain't over,' he said. 'You won the first round, Mr Prosecutor, but don't cut your gloves off, because the fight is not over. Justice will come to Ferguson!' On Sunday, Darren Wilson's lawyer revealed that the police officer chose to resign without severance pay after being made aware of threats that his fellow officers would be harmed if he stayed in the force . But Sharpton insisted that Wilson did little good by resigning. Rev. Al Sharpton tells the congregation to point at Michael Brown Sr. and the Brown family, standing in the front, and send them their prayers . 'You can't heal if you are leaving the injured out of the process,' he said. 'This is not about Darren Wilson's job. This is about Michael Brown's justice.' Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, and his father, Michael Brown Sr sat among family members for the service where their son's funeral was held three months ago. The unarmed teenager was shot dead  by white police officer Darren Wilson in August. Last week, a grand jury chose not to indict Mr Wilson in shooting, sparking violence and protests in Ferguson and across the United States. Sharpton urged his congregation to join the peaceful protests in Ferguson, but condemned those who had used Brown's death as an excuse to burn and loot businesses in the community. Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, watches Reverend Al Sharpton speak during the service . Reverend Al Sharpton also spoke at a service held at a parking lot on West Florissant Avenue, next to where the Flood Christian Church once stood . 'Don't confuse them with the young folk who are standing up and marching, and the old folk,' he said. 'They are the true patriots in this country, because they are asking for the system to correct itself.' After the service at Friendly Temple Missionary, Sharpton spoke at a service held at a parking lot on West Florissant Avenue, next to where The Flood Christian Church once stood. In the background stood the remains of the building that was torched during the violence that followed the grand jury decision not to indict Mr Wilson.

"With the clocks going back, the nights drawing in and leaves turning brown, Britain has taken on a particularly autumnal feel in recent days, despite temperatures hitting an unseasonably high 17C. And there was perhaps nowhere better to experience the changing season than in Buttermere in the Lake District today, where although temperatures were a slightly more wintry 12C, the fells were bathed in sunshine and took on a glorious golden glow, reflected in the still waters of the famous lake. However, further south the picture was less bright, with much of the south subjected to showers leaving tourists visiting Windsor Great Park reaching for their umbrellas. Scroll down for video .

Fields of gold: The golden hue of the lakeside trees gave the picturesque surroundings a distinctly autumnal flavour . Much of the UK was again unseasonably mild, with temperatures reaching 16 or 17C in many parts of the country, and the north enjoying bright sunshine, despite the band of drizzly rain hanging over the south. October has been one of the hottest since records began in 1659, and temperatures on Friday could reach a record Halloween high of 21C as families continue to enjoy a warm half term. Met Office figures show October’s average temperature is 12.4C, 1.6C above normal, in central England, the region enclosed by the Thames, Lancashire and Bristol - covering close to half of England’s population including London, Birmingham and Manchester.

Surroundings: Buttermere is surrounded by fells, notably the High Stile range to the south west of the lake, Robinson to the north east, Fleetwith Pike and Wainwright favourite Haystacks in the south east and Grasmoor in the north west. Tranquil: The glorious autumn hues of green and brown woodland are reflected in the still, glassy waters . A temperature of 12.5C would rank this month in the top 10 hottest since 1659. The hottest October ever recorded is 2001’s 13.3C. The Met Office has forecast an 'unseasonable' highs of 19C for tomorrow and up to 21C in the south on Friday, breaking the October 31 temperature record of 19.4C, set in Margate, Kent, in 1968. Even further north in Manchester the Mercury is set to hit 20C. And while tomorrow will start with rain in Scotland and drizzle elsewhere, some sunshine is expected to break through in the south east. Moving into the evening, it will be a dry night in the south-east with some clear skies, but cloudier elsewhere and more patchy rain in the west with heavier rain in north west Scotland.

It's typical autumnal weather which will be windy and rainy at times with some warm spells as well. Changeable is the best way to describe it.’ She added: ‘The cold will start to move in over the next few days to western and northern parts which will bring temperatures down, especially in the North and Scotland, which will feel much colder as temperatures drop down to about 10C (50F). ‘The UK has been mild for much of the month and 2014 could turn out to be one of the hottest years on record. Temperatures have often been above the norm.’ Forecast: The warmer weather is likely to continue into November, although many areas will be blighted by rain .

"Protesters in Ferguson have set an American flag ablaze in another night of protests over the shooting of teenager Michael Brown and the clearing of the officer who killed him. A group of youths crowded round outside the Ferguson Police Department's headquarters as one of their number held the burning flag above a drain grate. It came amid continuing discontent in the Missouri town after a grand jury decided not to indict Darren Wilson, the officer who fatally shot Michael Brown, 18, on August 9 this year. Scroll down for video . Burning: A youth waves a burning Stars and Stripes as other protesters look on and film the event . Sit-in: Masked demonstrators outside the Ferguson Police Department take part in another night of protests, on the night officer Darren Wilson announced his resignation . Unrest: This protester, who was blocking a highway, shouted at police as they arrested him . It was announced Saturday that, despite the decision not to try him for any crime, Wilson had nonetheless resigned his commission with the police department. The officer said he had given up on law enforcement so that the community could 'heal' after his actions ultimately caused national outcry and night of looting and fires. Burning the United States flag was for a time illegal in almost every state, but the Supreme Court overturned all such laws in 1989 after deciding it is protected by the First Amendment. The extreme act of protest follows demonstrations up and down the country, in which many have said the fallout from the shooting makes them ashamed to be Americans. The flaming flag was part of wider unrest in the town. Stephen Deere, a reporter with the St Louis Post-Dispatch said that a jeep driving through the town had been shot at near Ferguson City Hall. Upside-down: This protester has inverted the U.S. flag. Many have said the incident, and its subsequent handling by the St Louis County grand jury, makes them ashamed to be American . Long march: Ferguson protesters today completed the first 10 miles of their so-called Journey for Justice to the state capital . Meanwhile, the parents of Michael Brown met with those of Trayvon Martin - another black youth who was controversially shot dead. Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin met with Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr, at a religious ceremony in Florida. Martin said: 'I just tried to encourage him and let him know that God has his hands on the situation, and he's gonna be OK'. Fulton said: 'There's really nothing you can say. Time is going to heal the wound. But I think what we can just do it just encourage them and tell them that they'll be able to make it because it is very difficult.' On the move: A group of Ferguson protesters are headed 120 miles to Jefferson City demanding police reform . Signs up: The NAACP has been prominent in the movement - members are seen here at the front of the march . Lining up: The so-called Journey for Justice will take place over the next seven days . Activists have now launched a week-long march to demand sweeping police reforms. On Saturday, a core group of about 100 marchers, many from other states, set out on a 120-mile 'Journey for Justice', from Ferguson to the Missouri state capital Jefferson City. The marchers, organized by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), are demanding the sacking of the Ferguson police chief, nationwide police reforms and an end to racial profiling. The peaceful march came after 15 protesters were arrested late Friday outside the Ferguson police department and after demonstrators shut down a shopping mall in St Louis, demanding a boycott of post-Thanksgiving shopping. Demands: Members of the NAACP pressure group had demanded that police adopt body cameras to allow more scrutiny . Monday's announcement that Wilson will not face charges sparked looting, arson and gunfire in parts of Ferguson, a mainly black suburb with a mostly white police force. The NAACP wants police to use body cameras, changes to the system of equipping police with military hardware, a promotion of diversity on the force and an end to the use of major force in cases involving minor offenses. A federal probe into whether Wilson violated Brown's civil rights is ongoing.","Stars and Stripes was set alight Saturday night in the Missouri town .

"Before fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine, Irina was a croupier in a casino who never dreamt of taking up arms. Now she is gambling with her life. Using the nom de guerre 'Gaika', a cartoon character that translates as Gadget, she has joined an artillery unit in a pro-Russian separatist group fighting government forces. 'When your home is being destroyed, everything that is dear to you, friends, work... It's about character,' she explains. 'Girls who go into combat are real Russian women.' Scroll down for video . 'Real Russian woman': Pro-Russian rebel Irina says she has no regrets about going to war against Ukraine . The experience of fighting against the formidable Ukrainian army has been tough but despite that, she has no regrets. 'Howitzers, large vehicles... the noise is what I will remember most,' she says. 'Painful memories go away. 'We try to focus on the positive, joyful, meeting friends. There are so many friends around now, the war is bringing people closer.' Her unit, based outside her home town of Donetsk, the main rebel stronghold in eastern Ukraine, is part of a rebel militia called Oplot and includes six women - herself, three medics, a fighter and a reconnaissance specialist. 'I had doubts before allowing women in,' admits their commander Yesaul, a Cossack from the nearby Luhansk region. Fighter: A female pro-Russian rebel fighter poses with her weapons outside the town of Nizhnaya Krinka . Tough: This  rebel was among the fighters to take part in the battle for Donetsk's Sergey Prokofiev airport . Fighting spirit: A pro-Russian fighter poses with her weapon in central Donetsk, capital of the Donbass region . 'But now I actually have more trust in them then in men. Women don't drink and I am sometimes seriously worried seeing my men's condition when they are relaxing after a mission.' Like the men in the conflict, the women come from all walks of life. A comrade in arms, who gave her name only as Irina for fear of retribution after the conflict ends, used to work at a petrol station in the town of Gorlovka. 'The fear is always there,' she confesses. 'But I was more afraid when I was sitting at home and hearing shells fly by. Then I got used to the sound.' Like her comrades, Irina has given up many home comforts, but not all. 'War is war but somehow I still need to wear make-up,' she smiles. But it's not only the pro-Russian rebels who count women among their number. They are also among the volunteers fighting on the other side of the conflict. Around 10 women have joined the 150-strong Shakhtarsk Battalion, a paramilitary force fighting alongside government troops, which is based in an oak grove about 40km from the city of Dnipropetrovsk - roughly 250km from Donetsk. Battling: Despite privations, the women say that fighting for the rebels is what a real Russian woman does . Fighting back: Ukrainian government forces also boast female fighters, among them Stella, 33 (pictured) Action: Nadie, 36, is based in the village of Luhanske in eastern Ukraine and has seen action against the rebels . The unit if recovering from a battle in late August around the town of Ilovaysk in which government forces were encircled and suffered heavy losses. A 20-year-old nurse called Maria was among those who came under fire and says about 30 of the battalion were killed or wounded. 'I didn't want to go into, let's say, humanitarian aid because that makes no real sense if there is no one to drag away our wounded lads,' she explains. 'Many die because there was no one to do that. I do that.' She says the men and woman 'live, eat and fight together'. In combat, she carries only a pistol and a medical bag so that her hands are free to help the wounded. Her comrade Alyona, 21, joined up after taking part in anti-government protests in the capital, Kiev, that culminated in the removal of former president Viktor Yanukovych who had been sympathetic to Moscow. Leading the charge: Nadie is one of the Ukrainian army's tank drivers and as a result, spearheads attacks . Combat: Women also fight as frontline infantry like this Ukrainian government soldier and serve as medics . Feminine: Despite the privations of life on the frontline, women fighting on both sides don't scrimp on make-up . First she joined the National Guard but found the role - maintaining roadblocks and checking documents - less than interesting. 'I wanted to fight,' she insists. 'This is just the beginning, the so-called ceasefire is just a pause. I want to fight until the end.' Although some women serve alongside their husbands and boyfriends, others are single, although that doesn't mean they're treated differently. Female fighters on both sides say the men in their units treat them as equals, though sometimes showing more leniency. They have little respect for men who have not taken up arms.

Alla has been with the separatist rebels since the start of the conflict, first serving as a cook on a roadblock. 'She fired her first training shots at a duck on a river and now has a pistol and an assault rifle - both of which she's more than happy to use.

"Glenn Greenwald threatened to reveal reveal the names of citizens targeted by the US government, saying he was saving 'the best for last' The journalist who helped Edward Snowden leak millions of British and American intelligence secrets has threatened to publish fresh revelations about GCHQ. Glenn Greenwald said the UK’s eavesdropping post was ‘unrestrained and vicious’ compared to their counterparts at the US National Security Agency (NSA). He also said he would reveal the names of citizens targeted by the US government, saying he wanted to ‘save the best for last’. Snowden, 30, became one of the world’s most wanted men last June when he broke cover as the civilian CIA worker who stole classified documents from the US National Security Agency. He leaked details of attempts by state spy agencies - including Britain’s GCHQ - to view citizens’ private information. It showed that intelligence chiefs harvested internet histories, emails, text messages, calls and passwords. The defence contractor, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, copied up to 2million files in one of the biggest leaks in US history - on a par with WikiLeaks whistleblower Bradley Manning - then handed the secrets to the Guardian. Promising more revelations about GCHQ, Mr Greenwald said: ‘The British are more unrestrained and vicious in their surveillance mindset than America. ‘When you go to the park in New York you see these big built-up muscular guys and they have these tiny shih-tzu dogs. ‘It will seem a mismatch but the shih-tzu is super-vicious and yapping. ‘That’s how I see the relationship between GCHQ and the NSA.’ His pledge to publish more damaging material in The Intercept, the online magazine for which he now works, will unnerve security chiefs on both sides of the Atlantic who are still reeling from their surveillance activities being exposed. Snowden, 30, became one of the world¿s most wanted men last June when he broke cover as the civilian CIA worker who stole classified documents from the US National Security Agency . Mr Greenwald said: ‘One of the big questions when it comes to domestic spying is: “Who have been the NSA’s specific targets?” ‘Are they political critics and dissidents and activists? Are they genuinely people we’d regard as terrorists? ‘What are the metrics and calculations that go into choosing those targets and what is done with the surveillance that is conducted? ‘Those are the kinds of questions that I want to still answer. ‘As with a fireworks show, you want to save your best for last. ‘The last one is where the sky is all covered in spectacular multicoloured hues.’ Mr Greenwald spoke out as speculation mounted that Snowden could have been a spy working - unwittingly or need - for Russia or China. Intelligence chiefs believe he is now a ‘puppet’ passing details of military capabilities, operations and tactics to unfriendly nations. Snowden claims he acted after becoming convinced the US government’s actions were a ‘threat to democracy’. He fled to Hong Kong, then Moscow, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location. Mr Greenwald said: ‘It’s obviously so irrational but it resonates with so many of these tribal themes - how the Russians function and how the Chinese are menacing - and it’s just a standard demonisation tactic.’","Glenn Greenwald helped Edward Snowden to leak CIA documents .

"Jung Park, 41, allegedly placed ads in Korean newspapers seeking body paint models to work . A photographer  has been arrested on suspicion of trying to force women into having sex with him by threatening to have them deported if they refuse his advances. Jung Park, 41, allegedly placed ads in Korean newspapers seeking body paint models to work for him at Simple Touch Entertainment in Los Angeles. But police say they were approached by one model who said Park asked her to disrobe and pose for nude photos, then began to inappropriately touch her and tried to rape her. When the woman refused his advances, Park told her that he would report her to Immigration and Naturalization Services, she told police. Park was arrested on October 26 and later released after posting $100,000 bail. But since then several more models have come forward and reported similar experiences with Park during photo shoots and interviews at his place of business. Police said the advertisements the photographer used were listed in Korean newspapers, websites and radio stations, which were run by Simple Touch Entertainment. Investigators now are asking for anyone who thinks they may have been a victim of Park to come forward and contact the police. 'I hope he gets what he deserves,' one woman who said she responded to Park's ads told CBS Los Angeles. 'Innocent women, trying to make a living, and taking advantage of them; that's not right.'

"Talented: Indiana University student and rowing team member Karlijn Keijzer died on flight MH17 . A student at Indiana University is among the victims on board passenger jet MH17, which was shot down over Ukraine Thursday. Karlijn Keijzer, who lived in the Netherlands, was one of the 298 passengers and crew who died on the Malaysia Airlines flight to Kuala Lumpur. Keijzer, who was studying for her PhD with the university, was described as a talented student who had been working on cancer treatments. The 25-year-old, who also studied for her masters at the Indiana university in Bloomington, was taking a break from her studies for the summer vacation. University president Michael McRobbie said Keijzer's death was a loss to the entire campus. 'Karlijn was an outstanding student and a . talented athlete. 'Our hearts also go out to the families of all the victims of . this senseless act,' he said. As well as being part of the chemistry department Keijzer was a keen member of the varsity rowing team in 2011. The dedicated athlete had also won medals for European and world rowing championships in 2006 and 2007. 'She came to us for one year as a graduate student and truly wanted to . pursue rowing.

"Criticism: Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘The recording of information under RIPA is lamentably poor' Police are misusing controversial anti-terror powers to spy on journalists’ phone records, a damning report by MPs will reveal today. Using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) to unmask whistleblowers who help reporters made it ‘not fit for purpose’. Members of the Home Affairs Select Committee claim ‘lamentably’ poor records were kept of those who were targeted using the snooping legislation – making the process appear ‘secretive and disorganised’. Poor scrutiny also meant the police abused the powers without censure, they add. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘The recording of information under RIPA is lamentably poor. ‘We are concerned that the level of secrecy surrounding the use of RIPA allows investigating authorities to engage in acts which should be unacceptable in a democracy. ‘Using RIPA to access telephone records of journalists is wrong and must cease.’ The report follows two high-profile investigations in which detectives secretly accessed data from reporters at The Sun and The Mail on Sunday to unmask whistleblowers in cases involving senior politicians. Police are usually required to go to court to access a journalist’s sources. But RIPA powers require only that a request to access information is approved by a high-ranking police officer. Police and the security sources obtained communications records under the controversial legislation at a rate of about 10,000 a week. Some 88 per cent of requests were by the police. The MPs’ report says: ‘RIPA is not fit for purpose, with law enforcement agencies failing to routinely record the professions of individuals who have had their communications data accessed. ‘The recording of information under RIPA is totally insufficient, and the whole process appears secretive and disorganised with information being destroyed afterwards.’ Routine: Police and the security sources obtained communications records under the controversial legislation at a rate of about 10,000 a week. Some 88 per cent of requests were by the police. (File image) It adds: ‘We fully share the concern of journalists that their sources of information should be fully protected.’ The report said the Home Office should update the RIPA Code of Practice over dealings with journalists’ sources. It also recommended that the Home Secretary Theresa May used a review into whether the police are deliberately bypassing legal protections to ensure that they use RIPA powers properly.","Using legislation to unmask whistleblowers made it 'not fit for purpose'

"Britain is facing an ‘almost inevitable’ attack by fanatics who have been ‘militarised’ by Islamic State, according to police and security officials. In speeches today, Theresa May and senior police will warn that the ‘diverse’ terrorist threat posed by jihadis returning from Syria and Iraq is one of the greatest this country has ever faced. Potential attacks could range from a ‘lone wolf’ beheading in a crowded shopping centre or street, to a bomb plot using fertiliser stolen from British farms. One Whitehall official told the Mail: ‘It is almost inevitable that something is going to happen in the next few months.’ Scroll down for video . Theresa May will warn that the ‘diverse’ terrorist threat posed by jihadis returning from Syria and Iraq is one of the greatest this country has ever faced. Britain’s most senior officer, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said police and MI5 have already foiled five major plots this year . According to Britain’s most senior officer, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, police and MI5 have already foiled five major plots this year. Chillingly, there is normally only one major plot disrupted every 12 months. Addressing a conference in London, Mrs May will unveil draconian new laws to try to protect the public and stem the flow of cash and recruits to Islamic State. They include a ban on the payment of any ransoms to terrorists and making it easier to track extremists on the internet. Internet companies will be forced to keep data which helps to identify the user of an individual mobile phone or computer. But the law stops short of making them log every website a person visits after the Liberal Democrats said the so-called ‘snoopers’ charter’ was ‘dead and buried’. The Home Secretary’s new Anti-Terrorism and Security Bill, to be presented to MPs tomorrow, also includes powers to: . Sir Bernard said the challenges faced by police and MI5 in monitoring jihadis returning from Syria were huge. He warned: ‘They’re going to be militarised, they will have a complex web of people that they know, and of course they will have learnt tactics that they may want to use here.’ Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Sir Bernard said there was a ‘growing concern’ about the risk of a ‘lone wolf’ attack on British streets. Soldier Lee Rigby was murdered by two Muslim converts who ambushed him as he walked back to his barracks in Woolwich, South East London, last year. ‘It doesn’t take an awful lot of organising, doesn’t take too many to conspire together, there’s no great complexity to it,’ Sir Bernard said. ‘So that means we have got a very short time to interdict, to actually intervene and make sure that these people don’t get away with it.’ Today assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, the Met’s most senior counter-terrorism officer, will say the ‘danger posed by violent extremists has evolved’. Speaking alongside Mrs May at the Royal United Services Institute, he will say: ‘They are no longer a problem solely stemming from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, far away in the minds of the public. ‘Now, they are home-grown, in our communities; radicalised by images and messages they read on social media and prepared to kill for their cause.’ He will also reveal how police have offered specific advice to farmers to ensure that fertilisers are stored securely so they cannot be stolen by fanatics to make bombs. 'We will chop off the heads of whoever you bring': A British ISIS fighter dares west to send ground troops in this video rant . A member loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) waves the terror group's flag in Raqqa, Syria . Mrs May, who has been fighting a long-running battle with the Lib Dems for greater counter-terrorism powers, is equally bleak in her assessment. She said: ‘There was a time when people were looking at perhaps just Al Qaeda-related threats that were a long time in the planning. ‘Now the threat is more diverse in terms of the number of groups out there who will be looking to carry out attacks in the West. It’s also more diverse in that not everybody’s affiliated to a particular group – some are self-starting groups and you do have individuals, perhaps the “lone wolves” or the volatile individuals. ‘We have to look across the board at all sorts of threats that are out there.’ Abu Abdullah Al-Habashi (right), who fled the UK for the Middle East, is believed to have been killed there . The plans to make it easier to monitor the public’s use of the internet revives a long-running controversy which has split the Coalition. At the moment, only the so-called Internet Protocol address is recorded when a person uses the web. The IP addresses are not tagged to individuals and can regularly change, even on a home computer which connects to the internet using broadband. Under new laws, the internet companies must link these IP addresses to the identity of the person using them. But, at the insistence of Nick Clegg, it stops short of Mrs May’s demands for a full ‘snoopers’ charter’ which would make internet companies log details of every website a person visits, along with their use of social media. Tomorrow, a long-awaited report by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee will say MI5 was in the dark about clues on social media that could have alerted them to the fanatical intentions of the killers of Fusilier Rigby. The report will stop short of saying MI5 could have prevented the attack on the day.","Home secretary says jihadis are one of the greatest threats UK has faced .

"The CIA has curbed spying on friendly governments in Western Europe in response to the furor over a German caught selling secrets to the U.S. and the Edward Snowden revelations of classified information held by the National Security Agency, according to current and former U.S. officials. The pause in decades of espionage, which remains partially in effect, was designed to give CIA officers time to examine whether they were being careful enough and to evaluate whether spying on allies is worth running the risk of discovery, said a U.S. official who has been briefed on the situation. Under the stand-down order, case officers in Europe largely have been forbidden from undertaking 'unilateral operations' such as meeting with sources they have recruited within allied governments. Such clandestine meetings are the bedrock of spying. Scroll down for video . NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, pictured last October, was granted a Russian residency permit last month. Among his revelations, he revealed that the U.S. had tapped the phone of German leader Angela Merkel, causing tension between the two countries . CIA officers are still allowed to meet with their counterparts in the host country's intelligence service, conduct joint operations with host country services and conduct operations with the approval of the host government. Recently, unilateral operations targeting third country nationals, Russians in France, for example, were restarted. But most meetings with sources who are host nationals remain on hold, as do new recruitments. The CIA declined to comment. James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said during a public event on Thursday that the U.S. is assuming more risk because it has stopped spying on 'specific targets,' though he didn't spell out details. Spying stand-downs are common after an operation is compromised, but 'never this long or this deep,' said a former CIA official, who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because it's illegal to discuss classified material or activities. NSA leaks revealed that the U.S. agency had tapped German leader Angela Merkel's phone, making for an awkward exchange with President Obama . The pause, which has been in effect for about two months, was ordered by senior CIA officials through secret cables. The current stand-down was part of the fallout from the July 2 arrest of a 31-year-old employee of the German intelligence service. Suspected of spying for Russia, he told authorities he passed 218 German intelligence documents to the CIA. In a second case, authorities searched the home and office of a German defense official suspected of spying for the U.S., but he denied doing so, and no charges have been filed against him. A few days later, Germany asked the CIA station chief in Berlin to leave the country, an unprecedented demand from a U.S. ally. The move demonstrated how seriously the Germans were taking the situation, having already been stung by revelations made by Snowden, a former NSA systems administrator, that the agency had tapped German chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone. The NSA disclosure infuriated Merkel, who demanded explanations from President Barack Obama. It embarrassed both world leaders and has left many Germans skeptical about cooperating with the U.S. CIA managers were worried that the incident could lead European security services to begin closely watching CIA personnel. Many agency officers in Europe, operating out of U.S. Embassies, have declared their status as intelligence operatives to the host country. The spying stand-down comes at an inopportune time, with the U.S. worried about Europeans extremists going to fight in Syria, Europe's response to Russian aggression and European hostility to American technology companies following revelations the companies turned over data to the NSA. While the U.S. cooperates closely with Europe against terrorism, spying can help American officials understand what their allies are planning and thinking, whether about counterterrorism or trade talks. The 'EUR' division, as it is known within the CIA, covers Canada, Western Europe and Turkey. While spying on Western European allies is not a top priority, Turkey is considered a high priority target — an Islamic country that talks to U.S. adversaries such as Iran, while sharing a border with Syria and Iraq. It was not known to what extent the stand-down affected operations in Turkey. European countries also are used as safe venues to conduct meetings between CIA officers and their sources from the Middle East and other high priority areas.  Those meetings have been rerouted to other locales while the pause is in place. The European Division staff has long been considered among the most risk-averse in the agency, several former case officers said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss secret intelligence matters by name. A former CIA officer who worked under non-official cover wrote a 2008 book in which he described a number of operational 'stand- downs,' in Europe, including one in France in 1998 because of the World Cup soccer championship, and another in a European country in 2005, in response to unspecified security threats. The former officer, whose true name has not been made public, wrote 'The Human Factor: Inside the CIA's Dysfunctional Intelligence Culture,' under a pseudonym, Ishmael Jones. He is a former Marine who served 15 years in the agency before resigning in 2006. The CIA acknowledged his status as a case officer when it successfully sued him for publishing the book without first submitting it for pre-publication censorship, as he was required to do under his secrecy agreement. The CIA last faced that sort of blowback from a European ally in 1996, when several of its officers were ordered to leave France. An operation to uncover French positions on world trade talks was unraveled by French authorities because of poor CIA tactics, according to a secret CIA inspector general report, details of which were leaked to reporters. The Paris flap left the EUR division much less willing to mount risky espionage operations, many former case officers have said.","Case officers in Europe forbidden from undertaking 'unilateral operations' - meeting with sources they have recruited within allied governments .

"A pistol thought to have belonged to famous Edwardian murderer Dr Crippen has been handed in to police during a firearm amnesty. The owner told police the gun once belonged to Hawley Harvey Crippen, the American medic hanged in Pentonville Prison for the murder of his wife Cora Henrietta Crippen. Crippen rose to infamy by allegedly poisoning and dismembering his wife, hiding her remains under the basement floor, and fleeing for Canada with his lover Ethel Le Neve who had disguised herself as a young boy for the journey. The handgun was given to police as party of an amnesty held last month which saw 446 weapons and 15,721 rounds of amunition surrendered in two weeks. Crippen is believed to have poisoned his wife Cora at his London home before attempting to flee to Canada . The owner told police the small gun once belonged to the notorious murderer Hawley Harvey Crippen . Crippen was born in Michigan and his first wife, Charlotte, died of a stroke in 1882. Having qualified as a homoeopath, he started to practice in New York where in 1894 he married his second wife Corrine 'Cora' Turner. They moved to England three years later. While in England, he took Le Neve for his mistress after she had been lodging at his house to support his meagre income. After his wife mysteriously disappeared in January 1910, he fled to Brussels with Le Neve, who was a young typist. The couple then boarded a ferry for Canada but the ship’s Captain Henry George Kendall recognised them and notified police who arrested them when the boat docked in North America. Crippen went on trial in October 1910 and was found guilty by a jury after just 27 minutes of deliberation. He was hanged at Pentonville Prison, London, on November 23, 1910. The handgun was given to police as party of an amnesty held last month which saw 446 weapons and 15,721 rounds of amunition surrendered in two weeks . Police found the remains of Crippen's wife's body buried under the brick floor of the basement of their London home after searching it for the fourth time. Large quantities of the toxic compound hyoscine were found in her remains and the court heard Crippen had bought the drug before the murder from a local chemist. Le Neve was acquitted of being an accessory to murder and emigrated to the U.S on the morning of Crippen’s execution. Other unusual items handed to Devon and Cornwall police in the amnesty include a set of antique duelling pistols and a flare gun used in the trenches of World War One. The vast majority of the firearms handed in have been destroyed by being cut into small and irreparable pieces which will be used for scrap metal. Investigators recovered  headless corpse from a shallow grave inside Dr Crippen's basement, but DNA evidence has since proved it was a man . American born Dr Harvey Crippen moved to Holloway in north London with his second wife Cora. She disappeared following a party at the couple's house in January 1910. Friends of Mrs Crippen became suspicious after seeing Crippen's mistress, who moved into the house, wearing her clothes and jewellery. An initial search by Scotland Yard found no evidence of any foul play, however, Dr Crippen fled with his mistress to Canada. After he disappeared, Scotland Yard conducted three further searches of the property where they recovered human remains. Crippen and his mistress were travelling on the SS Montrose when the captain of the vessel, who was keeping up-to-date with the news on the newly installed wireless, telegraphed Scotland Yard. Crippen's mistress, Ethel Le Neve, was travelling disguised as a young boy. An inspected boarded a faster vessel and raced Crippen across the Atlantic, arresting him upon his arrival in Canada. Had he boarded a vessel to New York, he would have probably escaped punishment. Crippen was returned to the Old Bailey where he was found guilty of murder after less than 30 minutes and hanged in Pentonville Prison in November 1910. The human remains recovered by Scotland Yard were badly decomposed and more than 100 years after their recovery, it is believed that the bones belonged to a man. Attempts have been made by distant relatives of Dr Crippen to exonerate him, however his body remains inside the walls of Pentonville Prison. A study reported in the Journal of Forensic Science in America by scientist David Foran said: 'Based on genealogical and DNA research, the tissue used to convict Dr Crippen was not that of Cora. ‘Further DNA testing showed the tissue was male. All we can say scientifically is, the tissue did not come from Cora. ‘One possibility is that Crippen murdered someone else and those were the remains discovered. Another possibility is that the celebrated investigators planted the evidence.’","Small pistol given to police believed to belong to the infamous murderer .

"A terrorist attack in the UK linked to Islamic extremism is 'almost inevitable' in coming months, security chiefs have warned. Ministers are reportedly being briefed daily by security officials who have warned of a 'step change' in the threat posed by terrorism since the rise of the so-called Islamic State insurgency. Scotland Yard and MI5 believe they have foiled three plots in London in the past few months, two of which were said to have been urgent interventions to stop terrorists ready to strike. Scroll down for video . Tight security: Armed police patrol Whitehall during the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph . Sniffing for trouble: Security was tight this year amid dire warnings of possible impending terror attacks . An unnamed source told The Times the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby last year had taught extremists 'they only need a kitchen knife and a mobile phone to carry out a high-impact attack.' The warnings come after tight security at Remembrance Sunday, with the Queen appearing at the Cenotaph in Whitehall after it was locked down by dozens of visible armed police. A judge yesterday extended the detention of four suspects arrested in connection with an Islamist terror plot just two days earlier. Counter-terror police seized the men, aged 19 to 27, on Thursday night at locations across west London and High Wycombe in the Thames Valley area, Scotland Yard said. It is understood the men were plotting an attack on British soil. The timing of the arrests raised fears that Remembrance Sunday events in London were alleged targets, but sources told The Times the Queen was not a target. Tensions have been raised by a slew of terror arrests amid fears British intervention against the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq could motivate a string of new radicals in the UK. Last month a 21-year-old man, a 32-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman were arrested by anti-terror police in three separate probes all linked to Syria. Officers searched two properties in Bedfordshire, two in west London and one in Hackney, north east London after raids over the last three weeks. Four terror suspects were also charged with plotting to kill policemen and soldiers in London drive-by shootings earlier last month. Tarik Hassane, 21, Suhaib Majeed, 20, Nyall Hamlett, 24, and Momen Motasim, 21, all from London, appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court amid tight security as they were charged with an Islamic State-inspired gun plot. It was alleged to have been formulated following a fatwa by a senior ISIS terrorist. Despite the chilling warnings and spreading climate of fear, the head of the UK's armed forces has urged Britons not to let terror fears 'stop the British way of life'. General Sir Nicholas Houghton said Britain must not 'succumb to any sense that there is a terrorist threat' and should carry on as normal. General Sir Nicholas Houghton said terrorist fears must not stop Britons from leading their normal way of life . Speaking ahead of the Remembrance Sunday events, the Chief of the Defence staff told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: 'I think the mood is definitely different this year but the biggest thing that makes the mood different, I think, is the intensity and the poignancy about it born of the aggregation of the 100 years commemoration of the First World War, the 70 years of D-Day, I think the end of combat operations in Afghanistan. 'But, certainly the proximity of the sense of threat for this weekend, which has intensified the nature of the security that's attendant on it, has sort of contributed to quite a different feel about this year.' Earlier this month, senior police officers and MPs said there was likely to be a significant rise in the number of armed police at the Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day commemorations in London due to increased fears of a terror attack. The arrests come a few months after the national terror threat level in the UK was raised from substantial to severe, meaning a terrorist attack is 'highly likely'. This assessment is separate from the evaluation concerning police officers. The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) raised the level against a backdrop of increasing concerns over hundreds of aspiring British jihadis travelling to Iraq and Syria to learn terrorist 'tradecraft' and fight alongside terror groups such as Islamic State (IS). Although there is currently no link to Syria or IS, fears were raised when IS fighters encouraged supporters in Western countries to 'rise up' and commit acts of terror in their home countries.

"The actor who plays Lord Grantham in TV drama Downton Abbey has hit out at those who believe the show’s Labrador Isis is being killed off because it shares its name with the Middle East jihadist group. Hugh Bonneville, 50, said anyone who thinks the reason for the dog’s current storyline in Julian Fellowes' period drama is down to Islamists is a ‘complete berk’. The yellow Labrador, who was named after the Egyptian goddess Isis - whose name means 'throne' -was diagnosed with cancer in the latest episode of the fifth series. Scroll down for video . Hugh Bonneville, 50, who plays Lord Grantham in TV drama Downton Abbey said anyone who thinks the reason for Isis the dog’s current storyline in Julian Fellowes' period drama is down to Islamists is a ‘complete berk’ It prompted a wave of speculation from fans and critics who claimed the dramatic storyline was a result of grim comparisons being drawn between the dog’s name and the rise of militants branding themselves Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) - also known as IS, ISIL and Islamic State. The militant group has been responsible for brutally beheading several hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning and fellow Briton David Haines. ISIS militants are also behind the murders of U.S. journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley. However, Mr Bonneville has denied the show’s storylines have been influenced by the terrorist group and said dogs in the show have always been named after Egyptian goddesses. On his website, he wrote: ‘To clarify recent speculation, the Labrador that appeared in Series One (1912-14) was a dog called Pharaoh. ‘From Series Two (1916-1920) onwards, the Labrador has been a bitch named – in keeping with the Egyptian theme – Isis. ‘Anyone who genuinely believes the Series 5 storyline (1924) involving the animal was a reaction to recent world news is a complete berk.’ Isis the dog made her first appearance in the period drama in its second series in 2011, replacing the earl's previous pet Pharaoh. Isis has been with the Crawleys for a decade after the demise of her predecessor Pharaoh (left). In a recent episode the Countess of Grantham (right) remarked on her  health and it has been revealed the dog has cancer . Dozens of businesses and organisations around the world have been forced to change their name after being boycotted by customers who believed they were linked to the Middle East jihadist group. From being named after the Egyptian goddess Isis, whose name means 'throne', to abbreviations, many businesses have adopted the name Isis in some form or another. However, after the rise of the jihadist network Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) - also known as IS, ISIL and Islamic State - many have been forced to re-think their brand due to grim comparisons being drawn. Earlier this month, a café in Manchester called Isis decided to change its name to Thairish - a combination of Thai and Irish - after parallels were drawn. Jill Campbell, who has Isis boutique (pictured) in Malvern, Worcestershire, for seven years, became a victim of a hate campaign after people mistakenly linked its name to the jihadist network terrorising the Middle East . Owners of the cafe said they were visited by police  who warned them of potential trouble over the name and later chose to change it amid fears of being targeted. A London-based private equity firm called Isis Equity Partners has also changed its name to Softcard after stating it was 'no longer prepared to share its name with a terrorist organisation'. ISIS Nova Scotia, a Canadian organisation which helps new immigrants settle in the country, is also currently deciding on a new name because it doesn't want to 're-traumatise' those who it helps. And a Belgian chocolate maker has also been forced to change its name from Isis to Libeert after comparisons were drawn to the terrorist group. Another business, a ladies' clothes shop in Malvern, Worcestershire, has also been forced to issue a statement saying it has no connection to the extremist group due to its name being IsisBoutique. Jill Campbell, who has run the the boutique for seven years, became a victim of a hate campaign after people mistakenly linked it to the jihadist network terrorising the Middle East. Tesco has recently put a range of flat-screen TVs branded ISIS (pictured) on sale at heavily-reduced prices . The 54-year-old issued a statement earlier this year in which she denied any affiliation with the group and suggested she may consider a name change. It also emerged this week that Tesco has put a range of flat-screen TVs branded ISIS on sale at heavily-reduced prices, sparking suggestions it is down to them sharing the name with the islamists. The ISIS 28 and 22 inch LED TVs, which normally retail at £179 and £129, have been reduced to £89 and £64, respectively. Shoppers have suggested the sudden sale of the electronics product is down to people drawing comparisons, but Tesco has denied there is any link and said the promotion 'has nothing to do with the terrorist group'. ITV has previously insisted the whole name issue is ‘an unfortunate coincidence’, adding that most of the current series was filmed before fans began pointing out the similarity in names. A spokesman said: 'Isis has been the Crawley's family pet since Series 2 (2011) and was named after the Egyptian Goddess. 'At the time the dog was named and up to and including the majority of filming of Series 5, no one was using that acronym to describe a terror group. ‘It is an unfortunate coincidence.’ The ITV show's dog is not the only one to be hit by comparisons between its name and the jihadist group.

Belgian chocolate maker Isis has been forced to change its name to Libeert after comparisons were drawn . A statue of Isis found off the coast of Alexandria . The goddess Isis was first worshipped in Ancient Egypt as the ideal mother and wife as well as the patroness of nature and magic. She is often depicted as the mother of Horus, the falcon-headed god featured throughout Egyptian theology. Her image as a model of womanhood made her popular both with the slaves, who saw her as a mother-figure, and the wealthy, who saw her as a example to wives. It was believed that the annual flooding of the River Nile came from the tears of Isis as she wept over the death of her brother Osiris. The figure of Isis passed into Roman and Greek mythology and she is still worshipped by some pagans today. Some scholars have suggested images of Isis holding her son influenced images of Mary and Jesus in Christian religion. She was also incorporated into the symbolism of Freemasonry and is referred to in Mozart's opera, the Magic Flute. The goddess also gives her name to the section of the River Thames from its source until it reaches Dorchester-on-Thames.","Hugh Bonneville, 50, denied Isis  is being killed off because of terrorist group .

"A windowless room awaits Louis van Gaal on Sunday. Whatever the result at Huish Park, Manchester United's manager will take a right in the tunnel and enter Yeovil Town’s self-proclaimed ‘Bunker’. It’s the ominous-sounding office of Gary Johnson and where the manager has been plotting the downfall of English football’s biggest name for the last six days. Van Gaal will slip inside to share a bottle of red post-match, but has been warned he may have to bring his own. VIDEO See Louis van Gaal on whether he will rotate his Manchester United starting eleven . Yeovil Town manager Gary Johnson and team captain Joe Edwards after their FA Cup second round victory . Manchester United and Louis van Gaal are Yeovil's next opposition in the tournament . ‘There are no windows,’ Johnson told Sportsmail before a game he puts up there with the biggest in their history. ‘If it’s fresh air he wants then we’ll have to go outside.’ ‘Unfortunately if Louis wants an expensive bottle of wine in my office afterwards he’s going to have to bring it with him - he’s probably got a stash somewhere in his kit bag. We’ll go for a mediocre red, but if he wants a real top one then I’ll be happy to share.’ How much they are willing to spend on a decent Merlot isn’t the only thing that’s a little different about these two clubs. Yeovil’s weekly wage budget stands at £37,500 - the amount Radamel Falcao earns in a single day. Wayne Rooney takes home more in a month than the minnows shell out in a year. Not that it really bothers Johnson, who is the epitome of pragmatism but holds that sparkle which fills this small town with hope of an unlikely upset to match their greatest ever against Sunderland in 1947. Incidentally, the prize for that scalp was an 8-0 drubbing against Sunday’s opposition. Radamel Falcao earns the same amount in a day as the whole Yeovil squad does in a week . United captain Wayne Rooney earns more money in a month than Yeovil's whole squad does in a year . YEOVIL . Annual wage budget: £2m . Home capacity: 9,565 . Position: 24th in League One . MANCHESTER UNITED . Annual wage budget: £215m . Home capacity: 75,635 . Position: 3rd in Premier League . ‘We’d like to keep our reputation as a good FA Cup side,’ he added. ‘We’ve told all the new lads that Yeovil were the best non-league team for cup upsets for years, and that we do well when we’re the underdogs. We’re certainly the underdogs here by a million miles.’ They are even more up against it than when the draw was made, with Johnson fully admitting that Yeovil have taken their eye off the ball since beating Accrington in the second round replay. None more so than on Monday, when they were battered 3-0 at home against Leyton Orient in a defeat which leaves them rock bottom of League One. ‘Some of the players subconsciously saved themselves in that game and lost their place for United. They will learn from that pretty quick. Johnson and Van Gaal will share a bottle of red wine after Sunday's game . But Johnson revealed Van Gaal may have to bring his own wine if he has expensive taste . ‘If Louis watched us against Leyton Orient he’d probably feel they could put out their Under 14s against us. ‘We’ve had to get those games out of the way first if you like. This is a different kettle of fish. Hopefully the boys will go in with a different feeling, without the pressure of the points. Now it’s finally here we just can’t wait.’ Johnson - who says his experience managing Latvia stands him in good stead for games such as this - cannot be far off legend status in this pocket of the West Country. He was the man who won promotion to the Football League in 2003 and then did the unthinkable by taking Yeovil to the Championship two years ago. ‘If we win they might even put a statute up of me,’ he laughed. ‘I reckon I’ve earned one already, but the chairman says I’ve got to do a little bit more yet. I’m only 5’7” so it wouldn’t take a lot of metal, would it?’ Johnson’s side are going to have to show more than a bit of mettle if they want to inflict anything worse than a cheap bottle of wine on Van Gaal.","Manchester Untied travel to Yeovil Town for their FA Cup clash .

"Virgin Holidays is being sued for up to half a million pounds by a British holidaymaker who claims she contracted a life-threatening illness on an all-inclusive package holiday. Sarah Bowes-Phipps, a 31-year-old mother of one, said her dream Caribbean holiday ended with a case of food poisoning so severe that she had to have her gall bladder surgically removed. She said she became violently ill a day after eating a piece of mystery fish in a hotel restaurant infested with stray cats and birds at the Verandah Resort and Spa in Antigua. Mrs Bowes-Phipps became ill while staying at the Verandah Resort and Spa in Antigua in September 2011 . According to a writ filed at London's High Court, Mrs Bowes-Phipps ate ‘a small piece of an unknown fish in breadcrumbs, served lukewarm’ after ordering the ‘catch of the day’ at the resort’s beach bar and grill in September 2011. In the writ, her barrister, Asela Wijeyaratne, said she did not consider the fish to taste ‘fresh’, and she was awoken by ‘shooting, stabbing pains’ the following morning and had to be transported to hospital by ambulance. Her condition was so severe that she was airlifted to a hospital in Florida, where she underwent emergency surgery. Mrs Bowes-Phipps, from St Albans, remained in hospital in Florida for almost a month before she was airlifted to the UK, where she underwent further surgery. She was diagnosed with salmonella and secondary septicaemia, and is now seeking up to £500,000 in compensation from Virgin Holidays Ltd, according to the writ. Mr Wijeyaratne said that Virgin sold Mrs Bowes-Phipps and her husband Steve an all-inclusive one-week package holiday, and she did not consume any food or drink off the resort. The holidaymaker ate ‘a small piece of an unknown fish in breadcrumbs, served lukewarm’ The barrister claims that Virgin, through their ‘agents’ at the hotel, ‘failed to ensure that food and drink served to Mrs Bowes-Phipps was safe for human consumption’. The barrister said the resort had also ‘permitted stray cats and birds to enter the beach bar and grill restaurant with the consequent risk of contamination.’ Mr Wijeyaratne alleges that there were no adequate food hygiene systems at the hotel and that the ‘hotel accommodation was so unsafe that no reasonable holidaymaker would agree to go on holiday there.’ The writ states that her claim is 'currently expected to exceed £300,000' but to be less than £500,000 in total. The contents of the writ have not been tested in evidence before a judge. A spokesman for Virgin Holidays said: 'Virgin Holidays is aware of the complaints raised by Mrs Bowes-Phipps and the claim issued in the High Court of Justice. ‘Virgin Holidays exercised all reasonable care and skill in the selection of the Verandah Resort and the monitoring of the services and facilities, including the provision of food and beverages. ‘As Mrs Bowes-Phipps has now issued proceedings, solicitors representing the Verandah Resort will be filing a defence to the claim and it would be inappropriate for Virgin Holidays to comment any further on the matters now forming part of legal proceedings.’ A spokesman for Verandah Resort and Spa said: 'Out of respect for our guest’s privacy, we are not at liberty to discuss this pending matter at this time.'","Sarah Bowes-Phipps became ill after eating fish at a resort in Antigua .

"Harrison Odjegba Okene had survived three days in a small air pocket inside an overturned tugboat at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean before he was rescued at the last moment by a diver – but the lucky 29-year-old says he will not be tempting fate again. In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, Okene described his miraculous rescue that was videotaped and which went viral after it was uploaded on the Internet this month. The 29-year-old still has nightmares and vows to never return to the sea again. He has taken a new job as cook on firm ground instead. Scroll down for videos . Covenant:  Harrison Odjegba Okene, the ship's cook who was rescued from a capsized tugboat in May after nearly three days, said he had promised God that if he survives the ordeal, he will never go back in the sea . Living 'corpse': Okene recalled that when he tapped on the diver's neck to draw his attention, the man thought he was a dead body floating in the water . Saviors: In this image, Harrison Odjegba Okene, second left, poses inside a decompression chamber with members of the DCN Diving team who saved his life after being trapped for three days underwater . Fateful moment: Okene's stretches through the murky waters to reach a rescue diver as the diver's headcam video records the moment he becomes aware that Okene is still alive . Okene was the only survivor in a crew of 12 when the boat capsized in May. It still haunts him. In addition with being saddled with survivors’ guilt, some Nigerians believe he saved himself through black magic. The Jascon 4 was resting on the seabed upside down at a depth of about 100 feet. The plump cook survived on only one bottle of Coke. Two flashlights that he had found gave up after less than one day. In the dark, he had almost given up hope after three days of praying to God for a miracle when he suddenly heard the sound of a boat, a hammering on the side of the vessel and then, after a while, saw lights and the rising waters around him bubbling. He said he knew it had to be a diver, but he was on the wrong end of the cabin. Air bubbles rose around the cook as he squatted inside his air pocket. Rescue seemed imminent, but then the lights disappeared. Thirst: Okene could not drink the saltwater in the cabin and had to rely on a single can of Coke to quench his thirst for 62 hours . Desperate, Okene swam through pitch-dark waters in the sunken boat to grab the diver. Okene couldn’t find him and, with the air in his lungs giving out, he swam back to the cabin that held his precious, but dwindling, pocket of air. ‘He came in but he was too fast, so I saw the light but before I could get to him, he was already out. I tried to follow him in the pitch darkness but I couldn’t trace him, so I went back,’ he said. His rescuers from the Dutch company DCN Diving were looking only for bodies and already had recovered four corpses when they came upon Okene. When the diver returned, Okene had to swim again to reach him and still he did not see him, so he tapped the diver on the back of his neck, giving the man a scare. When the diver saw his hand he said ‘corpse, corpse, a corpse,’ into his microphone, reporting up to the rescue vessel. ‘When he brought his hand close to me, I pulled on his hand,’ Okene said. Night terrors: Akpovona Okene, the cook's wife, said her husband still suffers from nightmares seven months later . ‘He’s alive! He’s alive! He’s alive!’ Okene remembers hearing. Okene described a surreal scene after the diver emerged into the air pocket. ‘I knew when he gave me water he was observing me [to see] if I’m really human, because he was afraid,’ he told the AP last Thursday. The diver first used hot water to warm him up, then attached him to an oxygen mask. Once saved from sunken boat, he was put into a decompression chamber for 60 hours before he could safely return to the surface. Until his rescue, Okene believed his colleagues must have escaped. The tug was one of three towing a Chevron oil tanker in Nigeria’s oil-rich Delta waters, but on May 26 there was a sudden lurch and it keeled over. ‘I heard people shouting, I felt the vessel going down, going down, I heard a voice saying “Is this vessel sinking or what?”’ Okene explained that he was in the bathroom when the tugboat capsized, sending the contents of the room falling on his head. From the outside, the cook could hear his colleagues’ desperate cries for help. Saving grace: Mr Okene had been trapped in the air pocket for more than 60 hours when divers found him . Touching moment: The diver's camera captured Mr Okene reaching out his hand to one of the team of divers, letting them know he is still alive . Lucky skipper: Mr Okene, the ship's cook, was the only survivor from the crew of 12 . ‘My colleagues were shouting “God help . me, God help me, God help me.” Then after a while I never heard from . them [again], ‘he recalled. The . 29-year-old man said that he had spent the first two days of his ordeal . incessantly praying to God, but on the third day he stopped, accepting . that death was inevitable. When recounting the rescue at his local church, the pastor asked him if he had used black magic to survive. ‘I was so surprised! How could a man of God be saying this?’ Okene said, his voice rising in disbelief. He . didn’t go to the funerals of his colleagues because he feared their . families’ reactions — Nigerians being generally very religious but also . superstitious. ‘I couldn’t go because I didn’t know what the family will say, thinking “Why is he the only one to survive,”’ said Okene. It’s a question that has shaken his steadfast faith. ‘Every week I ask [God] “Why only me? Why did my colleagues have to die?”’ His wife Akpovona Okene, 27, said he still suffers nightmares seven months later. ‘When . he is sleeping, he has that shock, he will just wake up in the night . saying “Honey see, the bed is sinking, we are in the sea,”’ Mrs Okene . said. Okene said he made a . pact with God when he was at the bottom of the ocean: ‘When I was under . the water I told God: If you rescue me, I will never go back to the sea . again, never.’ Okene, a . 29-year-old ship's cook, was the only known survivor from the boat of 12 . men, which capsized on May 26, 20 miles off the coast of Nigeria. Divers were stunned to find Mr Okene alive after three days with no food or water . Long way back: After being brought to the diver's bell, Mr Okene spent another 60 hours in a decompression chamber where his body pressure was returned to normal . A . video of his rescue showed the moment Okene, who was left fighting to . breathe inside a four-foot-high bubble of air, reached out a hand and . touched one of the team of divers, letting them know he is still alive. It had been feared - and assumed - that all aboard had perished. Of the 11 others aboard the tugboat when it sank in rough seas 10 have been found dead. One remains missing. Okene . squeezed into a compartment after the boat sank and settled . upside-down. Before closing the cabin door to stop the water coming in, . he had seen three dead colleagues in the water. Quick-thinking Okene took two mattresses from the beds and sat on top of them, hoping to stay afloat. He was brought to the surface after 62 hours. 'I was there in the water in total darkness just thinking it's the end,' Mr Okene told Reuters at the time of his rescue. Although . he could not see anything he said: 'I could perceive the dead bodies of . my crew were nearby. I could smell them. The fish came in and began . eating the bodies. I could hear the sound.' After days soaking in the salt water parts of his skin began peeling away and he was gasping for water as he could not drink the seawater that he was trapped in. South . African divers came down to search for any survivors of the Jacson 4 on . May 28 and they were stunned to find Mr Okene still alive. Quick-thinking: Ship's cook Harrison Okene, 29, managed to survive for over two days underwater by floating on a mattress in an air bubble . Miraculous: Mr Okene was the only survivor from the Jascon-4 tugboat that capsized and sunk in the Gulf of Guinea in heavy seas . Paul McDonald, a member of the rescue crew, said at the time: 'All on board could not believe how cool he was when being rescued. 'The divers put a diving helmet and harness onto him. It was amazing to be part of this rescue.' Kurt Glaubitz, a Chevron spokesman, said the boat overturned while towing a Chevron oil tanker in the Gulf of Guinea.","Harrison Okene, 29, was trapped in air pocket in the dark with no food and only a can of Coke for 60 hours in May .

"The lid of an Egyptian coffin discovered in Britain has sold at auction for £12,000 - despite authorities in Cairo attempting to stop the sale. Auctioneer Stephen Drake was checking out the contents of a seaside house after the death of the owner when he found the cobweb-covered relic. It was standing upright in a room only accessible through a hole an outside wall, complete with painted face and faded hieroglyphics. Scroll down for video . History: Despite Egyptian efforts to prevent the auction, a 2,300-year-old Egyptian coffin lid sold for £12,000 on Saturday. Right, a close-up of the incredible artwork on the artefact . Mr Drake consulted historians at the Fitzwilliam museum in Cambridge who said the sarcophagus cover appeared to date from 330BC. At the request of the home owners he entered the 6 ft 5in tall Egyptian artefact into an auction. But the Ministry of Antiquity in Cairo instructed the Egyptian embassy in London to try to prevent the sale - suggesting it had been 'illegally removed from Egypt.' An embassy official told The Independent: 'We tried to encourage the auction house to convince the family that we are keen to repatriate it to its country of origin. 'We wanted them to give it up voluntarily but unfortunately they refused.' The Egyptian Embassy are believed to have reported the proposed sale to Scotland Yard, but it is understood that the police are powerless to act . He added that sellers or owners of Egyptian antiquities 'should have proper provenance and an export licence.' The embassy official described such items as our treasure, part of our history and our culture', adding: 'This is not a normal commodity; you have to give perspective to the cultural element here and our right to repatriate this.' The Egyptian Embassy are believed to have reported the proposed sale to Scotland Yard, but it is understood that the police are powerless to act as it is a civil matter. Defending the sale auctioneer Mr Drake said: 'Legally we are allowed to sell it; the vendor wants us to sell it for them, we are acting on their behalf.' The coffin lid was found in a house, in Bradwell-on-sea, Essex, which was being renovated. The lid used to belong to big game hunter Captain 'Tiger' Sarll who is thought to have found the artefact in Africa and brought it back to Britain . It used to belong to big game hunter and journalist Captain William 'Tiger' Sarll who is thought to have found the artefact in Africa and brought it back to Britain. Experts believe the coffin was made for 'Hor, son of Wenennefer', but there was no sign of the rest of it at the house. Captain Sarll died in 1977 and his wife continued to live in the house until her death in 2005. Mr Drake, 55, said: 'It really was quite bizarre. I'd been asked to look at the house by relatives of the previous owner, who'd died. 'When I got there the renovation work was fully under way, and a large hole had been smashed in one of the outside walls. 'When I stuck my head through and looked inside, I was surprised to see the coffin lid leaning up against a wall in the corner, covered in dust and cobwebs. 'There was a painted face on it and some hieroglyphics. It was just like a scene from an Indiana Jones movie.' The coffin lid was given an estimated value of between £1,000 and £2,000 - but it sold for £12,000 on Saturday. Capt Sarll's granddaugher Ali Watkins travelled from her home in Devon to watch the sale at Willingham Auctioneers in Cambridgeshire. She revealed her grandfather had painted its face - and said it needed restoring as it had woodworm. She said: 'He was a great adventurer and travelled the globe. But we don't know the exact history of how it came in his possession. 'We didn't know what it was going to go for but it's a good price and the lady who won the bid was very happy and she thought it was going to go for awful lot more. Captain Sarll (left) was also a war correspondent, photographer and actor . 'It's going to go to a private museum and I will keep in touch.' The house also contained another historical relic - a vinyl record of the Eamonn Andrews TV show, This Is Your Life. Ali says a picture of the sarcophagus was featured in a book presented to Capt Sarll when he appeared on the show in 1961. Capt Sarll was also a war correspondent, photographer and actor. He was well-known for his frock-coat, striped grey trousers, silk hat, patent leather boots, monocle and spats. The new owner of the coffin lid, who asked to remain anonymous, said it will go to a private museum.","Sale goes ahead despite relic being 'illegally removed from Egypt'

And the speedster is expected to be fit enough to be on the substitutes bench for Arsenal against Hull on Saturday - a welcome boost to manager Arsene Wenger who is already without the likes of Mesut Ozil, Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud.

'Theo is not too far away now,' Wenger said last week. 'Serge has been out for a long, long time and Theo has also been out for nine months, so it's good to see them back. 'They've worked very hard and they're very dedicated. They are back in the group on a daily basis and that's very good news.'

Arsenal boss Wenger has praised the attitude of both Walcott and Gnabry as they have battled their way back from serious knee injuries . Gunners goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, meanwhile, has praised young defender Calum Chambers for his attitude and humility since joining the club in July. 'It is a strange one because I would imagine that to be very successful at 19 you need to be massively confident, maybe overconfident at times,' the goalkeeper told the club's official website. 'But Calum isn't - he's very humble, very quiet and he shows his confidence on the pitch. It is a massive quality because he looks very comfortable, whether you play him at right back or centre back. 'He is comfortable on the ball, he is comfortable defending and he is very strong as well. He has been a massive signing. 'The pressure was on him as well because he was 19, he came to a big club and he went straight into the starting XI but he has been coping very well.'

"Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has advised Liverpool fans not to boo Cristiano Ronaldo at Anfield on Wednesday night because it will make him play even better. Ronaldo spent six fruitful years at Liverpool's rivals Manchester United from 2003 to 2009, and could be in for a hostile reception in the Champions League clash. But the Real boss, despite admitting Ronaldo is always motivated, said the barracking atmosphere gees him up even more.

But if the atmosphere is hostile it motivates him more.' Ronaldo has never scored at Anfield in his five appearances there, but only lost one of those, an FA Cup tie in 2006. But the Portuguese superstar is on fire again this term, scoring 20 goals in all competitions for club and country. Ancelotti admits the game will be tough, claiming the club has always 'made him emotional', particularly when the club's anthem is blared out. Portuguese superstar Ronaldo has scored 20 goals for both club and country already this season . He added: 'I followed Liverpool from 1984 when I faced them with Roma in the European Cup final and we lost on penalties,' he said. 'It's always been a club that make me emotional.

"Hong Kong's leader offered new talks with student leaders today, hours after police pepper sprayed protesters camped out in the city's streets. Leung Chun-ying held out the olive branch to pro-democracy campaigners as tensions rose in Hong Kong over the savage beating of an activist by plainclothes police. Public anger has simmered over after local TV aired footage of officers kicking a handcuffed protester overnight, as police in formation charged demonstrators barricading a highway underpass. Sprayed: Police use pepper spray as they clash with pro-democracy protesters at an area near the government headquarters building in Hong Kong early this morning . Tensions: The police used the non-lethal weapon to drive back protesters from the government HQ . Scuffles: Police officers point the pepper spray at activists as they push them back from the area . Defences: Pro-democracy protesters stand behind umbrellas, which they use to defend against the spray . Anger: Protesters scream at police as officers launch their attack on the demonstration this morning . Police action: A police officer, left,  points a pepper spray can to a protester . Friendly fire: A police officer washes his eyes after being hit with pepper spray fired by his colleagues . Heightening tensions, police used pepper spray again after midnight this morning to push back crowds trying to occupy a road outside the government's headquarters. Two protesters were arrested, police said, one for kicking a bottle at a car and one for assaulting police. Three officers were injured. The beating of democracy activist Ken Tsang by police appeared to mark a change in mood for many protesters. 'I used to say at every rally that frontline police officers were just following orders. We shouldn't hurt frontline officers because we were angry or because we blamed them. Frontline officers were just doing their jobs,' Joshua Wong, the 18-year old leader of Scholarism, one of three main groups leading the protests, told a rally Wednesday evening at the main protest zone in Admiralty. 'But I won't say this again at future rallies. If they're just doing they're work, why do they have to beat people?' Mabel Au, director of Amnesty Hong Kong, said: 'It is stomach-churning to think there are Hong Kong police officers that feel they are above the law.' Tense: Police face off with protesters outside Hong Kong's government offices . Intimidating: Helmeted police brandish their metal truncheons before moving in to attack protesters . Calm: Cameras flash as police officers stand face-to-face with protesters on Lung Wo Road . Protesters raise their arms as police begin an attack to clear them away from the government headquarters . The attitude towards police has changed since the beating of pro-democracy activist Ken Tsang this week . The U.S. called for a 'swift, transparent and complete' investigation into the beating, saying it was 'deeply concerned' by the police brutality reports. 'We encourage Hong Kong authorities to carry out a swift, transparent, and complete investigation into the incident,' said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. 'We renew our call for the Hong Kong government to show restraint, and for protesters to continue to express their views peacefully.' Prime Minister David Cameron meanwhile said Britain would stand up for Hong Kong's rights and freedoms, 'including those of person, of speech, of the press, of assembly', while his spokesman later urged restraint from police and protesters. Pro-democracy activist Ken Tsang, who was beaten by police, shows his wounds outside the police station . Pro-democracy protesters gather at police HQ during a demonstration against police brutality . A man screams at a police officer at the rally against police violence next to the police headquarters . Crowds gather outside the police headquarters as part of the demonstration against police brutality . Injuries: Civic Party member Ken Tsang Kin-chu in hospital after he was handcuffed, dragged to a dark corner and badly beaten by Hong Kong police during an attack on pro-democracy protesters . Rough: Dennis Kwok, a lawyer representing Mr Tsang, said officers also beat Mr Tsang inside a police station . Caught: The whole incident involving plainclothes police was filmed and broadcast by local network TVB . The two sides appear to be engaged in a cat-and-mouse game as the protests go into their third week. Earlier this week, police had removed barriers on the edges of the protest zones in an apparent attempt to chip away at the three main protest zones that have blocked traffic and angered some local businesses. Protesters reacted to those moves by building bamboo structures that police dismantled, and later moved into an underpass that police on Wednesday cleared them out of forcefully. Public anger over the aggressive tactics used by police Wednesday night erupted after local TV showed officers taking a protester around a dark corner and kicking him repeatedly on the ground. It's unclear what provoked the attack. Local Now TV showed him splashing water on officers beforehand. Ken Tsang said he was kicked while he was 'detained and defenseless.' He added that he was assaulted again in the police station afterward. Tsang, a member of a pro-democracy political party, lifted his shirt to show reporters injuries to his torso and said he is considering legal action against police. Police spokesman Steve Hui said seven officers who were involved have been temporarily reassigned, and that authorities will carry out an impartial investigation. The occupy campsite: Despite attempts by police to chip away at the camp, their violent actions over the past couple of days seem only to have galvanised support for Hong Kong's Occupy Central movement . Pro-democracy protesters gather at the Admiratly district to listen to Joshua Wong, the 18-year old leader of Scholarism, who indicated a change in attitude to frontline police officers after the violence . A protester takes a rest in his tent. The protests are the biggest since China took over Hong Kong in 1997 . The demonstrators have taken to the streets since September 26 to oppose the Chinese central government's decision to screen candidates to run in the territory's first direct elections in 2017 . They also want the territory's leader who was picked by Beijing, Chief Executive Leung Chan-ying, to resign . Several hundred people turned up at Hong Kong police headquarters on Wednesday night for a protest organised by a social workers' union over the treatment of Mr Tsang, who is a social worker. They lined up to file individual complaints about the beating. 'He was handcuffed already, he was not able to resist but still he was beaten,' said Maggie Yuen, one of the protesters. 'I don't see any explanation other than that the police abuse their authority.' The demonstrators have taken to the streets since September 26 to oppose the Chinese central government's decision to screen candidates to run in the territory's first direct elections in 2017. They also want the territory's unpopular leader who was picked by Beijing, Chief Executive Leung Chan-ying, to resign. China's central government is becoming increasingly impatient with the mostly peaceful protests, the biggest challenge to its authority since China took control of the former British colony in 1997. There were no signs, however, that Beijing was planning to become directly involved in suppressing them.","Tensions have risen in the city following the beating of a democracy activist .

"Three days ago – on Halloween – investment banker Rurik Jutting updated his Facebook with the words: ‘Money DOES buy happiness.’ That night on the 31st floor of his £2,000-a-month Hong Kong apartment, a scene from a horror movie unfolded. A prostitute’s throat had been slit, and police later found another woman rotting in a suitcase, trussed up and all but decapitated, who had been there for several days. Graduate: Jutting, who studied at Cambridge University, (pictured with an unknown Asian woman) has been charged after two women were found dead at his flat in Hong Kong . The bloodbath has yet to be explained, but Cambridge-educated Jutting’s final ‘update’ to his wealthy friends and family is a small, if baffling, insight into his state of mind around the time of the killings. The 29-year-old financier with investment bank Merrill Lynch certainly had a taste for the high life. He dined with a string of beautiful women in exclusive restaurants across the globe, according to those who know him. He enjoyed skiing holidays in Courchevel, the Alpine playground for the elite, and when in London he relaxed at a private members’ club in Shoreditch. The son of an engineer father and a nursery teacher mother, Jutting was described by one colleague in Hong Kong as someone who ‘talked very loud and made loads of money’. Earning a six-figure sum as an equity trader and living in luxury in one of the most vibrant cities in the world, Jutting was apparently going from strength to strength. His parents' home: The £1.1million Victorian house in Surrey where his parents Graham, 53, and Helen, 52, live . Grand: Before his parents' moved to their current home (above), Jutting lived with them in Grade II-listed house . But for reasons that are unclear, he appears to have mysteriously quit his job in the days around the first murder. ‘He always seemed so sad – he never said hello to any of us or smiled,’ said an employee who works in the skyscraper where Jutting lives, and who saw him being led away by police at around 4am on Sunday. Jutting had been in Hong Kong since July 2013, having transferred from Merrill Lynch’s London office where he had worked since July 2010, according to his profile on LinkedIn. Prior to that, he worked as a trader in capital markets at Barclays in London. Once physically fit, Jutting had been a member of the lightweight rowing club and the cross-country running club at Cambridge University, where he studied law and history at Peterhouse College in the mid-2000s. Heritage: The property his parents' live in inspired the illustrations in 'The Wind in the Willows' He was also the secretary of Cambridge University’s history society, which is called Clio, whose honorary members include intellectual heavyweights such as philosopher Professor Roger Scruton and the historian Dr David Starkey. A senior member of the university told the Daily Mail: ‘He was a bit of an action man, always on the move. I never heard about him getting into any serious trouble, so this comes as a real surprise.’ Prior to Cambridge, Jutting studied at £34,000-a-year Winchester College – motto: ‘Manners makyth man’. One contemporary at the independent boys’ school, Thomas MacThomas, wrote on Twitter yesterday: ‘So I knew Rurik Jutting when at school. Kinda disturbing. He was quite strange.’ As teenagers, Mr Jutting and his younger brother lived with their parents in a Grade II-listed house in Chertsey, Surrey. A neighbour there said yesterday the family were ‘nice enough’ but were ‘quiet and kept themselves to themselves’. After Rurik moved away to Cambridge, his parents, Graham, 53, and Helen, 52, moved to a grand Victorian manor worth £1.1million in the nearby commuter town of Cobham. The picturesque home, which is set behind wrought iron gates and surrounded by woodland, was the inspiration for Ernest Shepard’s illustration of Kenneth Grahame’s children’s classic The Wind in the Willows. Mrs Jutting is a teacher who runs Tumble Tots classes for toddlers in Surrey, her husband is an engineer, and they keep bees in their garden. Their other son, Auryn, 27, attended Oxford Brookes University and is believed to live in Brighton with his girlfriend. Rurik Jutting (right) was living the high life before he was charged with the murders of two prostitutes today . A man, who was thought to be Jutting’s father, looked exhausted as he told reporters yesterday morning: ‘Please respect our privacy.’ Prior to his arrest, Rurik Jutting had been in a relationship with an Asian woman called ‘Yanie’, according to posts on his Facebook page. He also ‘liked’ a Facebook page with photos of provocatively dressed Asian women. In one of his last postings, Jutting seemed to suggest all was well in his world. He posted a comment, copied from the internet, which read: ‘Is 29 the perfect age? I feel more secure, I’m a better friend and I know my limitations. No wonder 29-year-olds are the most popular age group.’ Only hours later, he was phoning the police to allegedly confess to murder. Government workers remove the body of a woman who was found dead at a flat in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district in the early hours of this morning. A British man was been arrested in connection with the murders . Officers investigate two adjacent balconies in the flat where the bodies were discovered on Halloween night . Investigation: Forensics check the crime scene at the luxury £2,000-a-month apartment in Wan Chai district . Murder scene: Men in overalls and masks search the flat for evidence after the women's bodies were found .

"Click here to follow @ralphellis56 . Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from the international weekend and also the programme of matches in the Football League. 1. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain won his 18th cap when Roy Hodgson brought him on in Estonia but has still never played 90 minutes in an England shirt. That has to change at some time because the Arsenal winger’s ability to run at people is becoming more and more valuable at international level. He changed the game at Wembley in the second half against San Marino, and in the 29 minutes he played in Tallinn he created three chances for team mates – more than anybody except Jack Wilshere (five) and Leighton Baines (three) managed in the entire game. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain energised a lacklustre England when he came on against Estonia on Sunday . 2. Even Lionel Messi can muck up from the penalty spot when he changes his technique. Of the 40 goals that the Argentine great had tucked away from 12 yards for Barcelona up until March this year, 27 of them went to the goalkeeper’s left. But his miss for his country in the 2-0 friendly defeat against Brazil was the second recent failure when he has gone for the opposite side of the goal. This one was saved by Brazil keeper Jefferson diving low to his right – and in September Messi missed altogether for Barca against Levante when he aimed for the top corner on that side. Lionel Messi paid the price for changing his penalty-taking technique in Argentina's friendly loss to Brazil . 3. Wayne Hennessey is far too good to be sat on the bench every week – but that has been his fate at club level for the last two seasons. The 27-year-old Crystal Palace goalkeeper was brilliant for Wales against Bosnia on Friday night, making eight saves including a couple that were genuine world class. Since a loan spell at Yeovil that was designed to get him fit after cruciate knee ligament injuries ended a year ago he’s played just one League game – Palace’s last of the season at Fulham - following his £3m January move to Selhurst Park from Wolves. Wayne Hennessey makes a save during Wales' 0-0 draw with Bosnia at Cardiff on Friday night . 4. Radamel Falcao took a month after arriving at Manchester United to get on the score sheet for the first time with the winner against Everton. His next goal hasn’t taken so long, though – the Colombian scored for his country in a 3-0 friendly against El Salvador in New Jersey. Top strikers tend to get their goals in bursts, so Louis van Gaal will be keeping his fingers crossed that’s true of the man on loan from Monaco. Radamel Falcao celebrates his goal for Colombia in their friendly win over El Salvador in New Jersey . 5. West Brom defender Gareth McAuley is another whose career has stalled at club level – he’s yet to be picked for a Premier League game since new boss Alan Irvine took over. The 34-year-old can win headers in both boxes, though, as he proved with one of the Northern Ireland goals from an Oliver Norwood corner that put Michael O’Neill’s team top of Group F. Irvine knows that already, though. McAuley also scored from a corner for his club against Hull in one of the two Capital One Cup matches he has started. Gareth McAuley celebrates after opening the scoring for Northern Ireland against the Faroe Islands . 6. John O’Shea is best known for rugged defending but the Sunderland and former Manchester United star can play a bit as well. The 33-year-old was the Republic’s best passer with every one of the 64 balls he played finding a team mate during the 7-0 romp over Gibraltar. It isn’t only against the minnows of international football that O’Shea can use the ball, though. His average for Sunderland this campaign is 44 passes a game, with a near 90 per cent completion rate. John O'Shea was flawless with his passing in the Republic of Ireland's 7-0 win over Gibraltar . 7. Dublin-born Eoin Doyle is emerging as the scoring sensation of the season with FIFTEEN already for Chesterfield in League One. Doyle, 26, got both his side’s goals in the 3-2 defeat at leaders Bristol City and already has two more than he got all of last campaign, following his move to play for Paul Cook following a spell with Hibernian. Martin O’Neill hasn’t got too many worries in the goal getting department following the 7-0 win over Gibraltar, but it sounds like six footer Doyle could be another to put on his radar. Chesterfield's Eoin Doyle celebrates one of his two goals in Saturday's 3-2 defeat at Bristol City . 8. Crewe might be bottom of the table at the moment, but the club’s reputation for finding and developing young talent shows no signs of waning. Steve Davis’s team registered only their second win of the season against Coventry thanks to a brilliant free kick by 17-year-old midfielder George Cooper. The Warrington-born starlet signed a three-year contract at Gresty Road in April and is rated as one of the best of the current crop of youngsters emerging through the club’s Academy. George Cooper (left) celebrates after scoring with a brilliant free-kick in Crewe's win over Coventry . 9. The first act of new Oxford chairman Darryl Eales when he took over in July was to sack manager Gary Waddock and bring in Michael Appleton, the choice of his chief executive Mark Ashton. Former Watford chief exec Ashton wanted the 38-year-old because they had worked together before that at West Bromwich Albion and according to Eales he ‘needed his own man’. That relationship is coming under increasing strain with the side still in the League Two relegation zone following a 5-1 hammering at Cambridge. Eales, who took over Oxford shortly after ending 11 years running the private equity arm of Lloyds Banking Group, has made it clear he wants the club in the promotion hunt this season. Oxford United manager Michael Appleton is feeling the strain after Saturday's 5-1 loss at Cambridge . 10. Robbie Neilson is just 34 but earning a reputation in Scotland as one of the game’s bright young bosses – and the way his Hearts team won at Alloa to open a nine point gap at the top of the Scottish Championship tells you why. Promotion rivals Rangers and Hibs have both failed to win at the Recreation Ground this season and Ally McCoist blasted the plastic surface as being ‘horrible’. Enterprising Neilson spotted that Alloa make extra cash by renting out their stadium to the public – and so persuaded his bosses to fork out £320 to hire it for a whole day’s training on Wednesday. Three days later they returned, with no fear of the plastic, and took three points thanks to Adam Eckersley’s 87th minute goal. Hearts boss Robbie Neilson gives out instructions during their win at Alloa on Saturday .","Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain deserves more game time for England .

"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani called on black communities to do more to prevent crime in their own neighbourhoods . Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has sparked fresh outrage by suggesting black communities need to do more to stop crime in their own neighborhoods. Giuliani said there was 'no question' unjustified shootings happen more often in black neighborhoods, but called on those communities to do more to curb violence so police were not called there in the first place. He was speaking after being shown a video of an officer in Cleveland killing 12-year-old Tamir Rice as he was holding an Airsoft pellet gun. Giuliani told Fox News Sunday said: 'There's no question that individual cases have situations that are unjustified, but you've got to put it in proper context. 'Why is it happening? Why is it happening more often in the black community? And doesn't it actually logically make sense that it's going to happen more often in the community where there is five, six, seven, eight, nine times more violence than in another community?' The comments were shared widely across social media, though users didn't appear particularly surprised by Giuliani's stance, which has remained largely the same since the fatal shooting of Ferguson teenager Michael Wilson on August 9. The Daily Edge tweeted: 'If a policeman shoots you for no reason, you've only got yourself to blame, says Rudy Giuliani'. Another user said the former mayor 'double downs on blaming black community for police problems'. Last week Giuliani caused a stir by suggesting more white officers were needed in certain neighborhoods to keep black people from killing one another. He did, however, admit there was 'more unfair interaction' between police officers and people in black communities. Scroll down for video . In his most recent interview Giuliani said responsibility for ending unnecessary shootings, rested with both police and the wider community. While the police force needed to be more diverse and better train their staff, 'just as much, if not more, responsibility is on the black community to reduce the reason why the police officers' were assigned to black neighborhoods. Giuliani went on to say he had changed his mind about the need for body cameras because he believes they would show that 90 or 95 per cent of police shootings are justified. Giuliani made the remarks after being shown a video of an officer in Cleveland killing 12-year-old Tamir Rice as he was holding an Airsoft pellet gun . Demonstrators protest outside the Edward Jones Dome St. Louis Missouri yesterday over the policing shooting of Brown on August 9 . Police officer Darren Wilson was not indicted but resigned following the shooting of  Brown . The comments come as the police officer responsible shooting Brown resigned. Darren Wilson, who had been on administrative leave since the August 9 shooting, said that he didn't want to put the lives of his colleagues at risk. Ferguson has been a hotbed of riots and protests since Brown's death and in the lead-up to the Grand Jury decision not to charge Wilson. Giuliani had earlier spoken out about the case saying that prosecutors should never have tried to  indict Wilson in front of a grand jury, something he said was simply political theatre. The remarks later led to accusations during a TV interview that Giuliani was a white supremacist. He refused to 'dignify' the question with an answer but went on to say he 'probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York than any mayor in the history of this city'.","Rudy Giuliani said Ferguson case should never have gone to Grand Jury .

"A Chinese baby girl has survived being buried alive for two hours after her parents believed she was stillborn. The baby, who has yet to be named, was born to Lu Xiaoyun and her husband He Yong on their farm in Dongdong, northeast China's Liaoning Province. Ms Lu believed she was four months pregnant and that she was suffering a miscarriage, when she went into labour while working on the farm. Scroll down for video . Miracle baby: This yet-to-be-named baby girl survived being buried alive for two hours after her parents mistakenly thought she had been stillborn . Ms Lu, who also has a 7-year-old daughter with her husband, experienced sudden sharp stomach pains and gave birth to what she thought was a stillborn girl. She called her husband , who  rushed back from work to find her in a pool of blood. Ms Lu was taken to hospital, but Mr Ye told ambulance staff there was no point to check on the baby as it was dead. In the meantime, Ms Lu's mother buried the baby under a tree in the yard. A doctor at the hospital questioned Mr Ye about the baby, and prompted that the body should be checked properly first as there might be a chance the girl was alive . The mother of the baby Lu Xiaoyun, thought she had suffered a miscarriage in her fourth month of pregnancy, but the baby was in fact born alive, in the sixth month . Happy news: Lu Xiaoyun and her husband He Yong read newspaper coverage of their happy ending .

"A Malaysia Airlines steward has been sacked after allegedly sexually assaulting a female passenger he was comforting because she was scared of flying with the disaster-struck airline.

Laura Bushney, 26, claims she was sitting at the back of Flightt MH20 when she asked Karim how long they had left before they landed. Miss Bushney said Karim then sat down next to her on the pretext of comforting her, before putting her legs up on to his lap and putting his hand into her pants. Laura Bushney, 26, says she was sexually assaulted on a Malaysia Airlines flight by a 57-year-old attendant who sat next to her on the pretence of comforting her . The airline confirmed in a statement that the crew member was no longer an employee but declined to comment on the allegation of assault. A spokesman said: 'Malaysia Airlines is not at liberty to comment on the matter as it is currently under the judicial purview of the authorities.' At the time of the attack, Miss Bushney was on the way  to Paris to visit her boyfriend. She says Mohammed Rosli Bin Ab Karim (pictured) carried out the attack on Flight MH20. Malaysia Airlines has confirmed an employee has been sacked, but refused to discuss the issue further . She previously told the Channel Seven Sunday Night show that Karim sat down next to her and began his attack by running his hand down her stomach. She pushed his hands away, but he would not leave, and started massaging her legs instead. Karim did eventually leave the seat, but returned half an hour later when he again moved her legs on to his and began touching her. She said: 'I could feel that he has got an erection and he is rubbing himself up against me. He put his hands inside my pants…He put his fingers inside me.' Ismail Nasaruddin, president of the National Union of Flight Attendants Malaysia, said Karim was sacked by a letter on August 22 two weeks after the purported incident took place. However, he branded the sacking unfair, saying Karim had not yet been found guilty of a crime and was not given a hearing. He added: 'What Malaysia Airlines did is a clear violation of natural justice. There has not been any hearing so far for the crew who is being held in Paris. 'Malaysia Airlines fired the crew based on the allegation. 'They judged him guilty before the trial. This is unjust.' Ismail urged French authorities to allow the man to return home if there was insufficient evidence to charge him, since his wife and three children are under emotional and financial stress. He added: 'We have to ensure this crew gets some justice. Why punish the crew when he is not found guilty?' Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared mysteriously in March with 239 people aboard, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. To date no trace of the plane has been found despite extensive searches, and the airline has been widely criticised for its handling of the crisis. The woman said she told stewards at the beginning of the flight that she was scared of travelling with the airline following the disappearance of MH370 and the shooting down of MH17 (pictured) earlier this year . On July 17, MH17 was shot down over Ukraine with 298 people killed after being hit by a surface-to-air missile which is believed to have been fired by Russian-back rebel troops. The disasters have left the Malaysian national carrier on the brink of financial ruin. The state investment fund which controls the company plans to privatise the airline in the hopes of injecting life back into it.","Laura Bushney, 26, says she told stewards she was scared before takeoff .

"A senior member of an Al Qaeda-affiliated terror group has spoken out in support of Peter Kassig - the American aid worker threatened by the Islamic State following the murder of Alan Henning. Abu Omar Aqidi - a prominent member of the Syria-based Nusra Front - pleaded with ISIS to spare Kassig's life after he identified the Muslim convert as a medic who helped treat his shrapnel wounds. Kassig is a former Methodist who converted to Islam after being captured and taken prisoner by ISIS in October last year and now calls himself Abdul Rahman. His life was threatened by the militant known as 'Jihadi John' earlier this month following the sickening filmed beheading of Henning - with ISIS sympathisers last night claiming the terrorists plan to murder Kassig in the coming days after a Wednesday 'deadline' for the U.S. to stop bombing them passed. Scroll down for video . Innocent: Peter Kassig (right) is an aid worker and former Methodist who converted to Islam after being captured and taken prisoner by the Islamic State in October last year.  Abu Omar Aqidi (left) - a senior member of Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front - has identified Kassig as a medic who helped treat his shrapnel wounds . Aqidi's unexpected intervention came in a series of messages posted on Twitter, in which he identified Kassig as an aid worker who  'performed a successful operation under bombardment by the regime'. He later explained this operation was to remove shrapnel from his leg. He also suggested that Kassig had treated a number of other fighters linked to the Nusra Front - including 'Abu Dujana', who is understood to be one of the regional leaders of the terror group. Aqidi went on to suggest that the senior Nusra Front fighters had later asked after Kassig and were surprised when 'he showed up in the video where ISIS threatened the United States' as they had wrongly assumed him to be a Western jihadist who had joined their ranks. 'It later became clear to me that he's an humanitarian activist that served in Deir Al-Zour for more than a year and was then kidnapped by ISIS,' the militant said. Kassig's case has exposed deep divisions among supporters of the Islamic State, many of whom have said it would be a great sin to murder a recent Muslim convert. Both extremists who met Kassig before he embraced Islam and former prisoners who were held alongside him have argued that the aid worker's conversion is without doubt sincere. Aquidi's remarks on Twitter came as ISIS supporters said a deadline for the U.S. to stop bombing the terror group in Syria and Iraq had expired. They claimed American citizen Kassig would now be murdered as a result - a statement that led to a  number of arguments among the jihadists and their sympathisers on social media. The 26-year-old is said to be haunted by a brief spell as a US army ranger in Iraq in 2007 and first travelled to the Middle East to 'give back' to the Muslim community there. In late 2012, shortly after leaving university, he founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance) - a non-governmental organisation providing  humanitarian aid to those in desperate need - and moved to southern Turkey to oversee the project first hand. With funds dwindling, Kassig continued to make risky ventures into Syria by himself - even after a large number of Westerners were kidnapped by the brutal Islamic State. He was said to have specialised in providing medical aid to fighters and civilians injured during clashes with regime forces. He was eventually seized by the jihadists on 1 October, 2013 while delivering medical supplies to Deir al-Zour. Leader: Yesterday Norwegian-born journalist Salah ad-Din Refsdal made a direct plea to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) to 'do the only right thing' and stop his followers killing Peter Kassig . Jihadi John's promise to murder Kassig if the U.S. doesn't end its airstrikes has illuminated deep divisions within the jihadist community over how the terror group should have dealt with the situation. Numerous ISIS sympathisers have claimed they would no longer support the terror group if they killed Kassig - a man they consider to be a pious Muslim. Although radical clerics from around the world had pleaded for Briton Alan Henning's life to be spared due to his aid work, the calls failed to pick up much support within the online jihadist community as he was not as Muslim himself. Yesterday Norwegian-born journalist Salah ad-Din Refsdal - who was born Paul Refsdal but converted to Islam while a prisoner of the Taliban in Afghanistan - made a direct plea to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to 'do the only right thing' and stop his followers killing Kassig. Citing a rule condemning the killing of converts, Resdal said: 'People have suggested that Caliph Ibrahim is not informed that some of his followers are planning to murder Abdul Rahman Kassig.' 'That must clearly be the case. Having studied Islam extensively he for sure is aware of how enormous of a sin it would be to murder a brother who just converted to Islam.'","Abu Omar Aqidi is a prominent member of Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front .

"Chelsea have made a move for Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Douglas Costa as they continue to broker a £20million plus deal for Fiorentina winger Juan Cuadrado. The move comes as Fiorentina dig in their heels over their valuation of Cuadrado. Costa is a Brazilian who has been on Chelsea's radar since he was a teenager and formed an exciting midfield partnership alongside current Stamford Bridge star Willian while at Shakhtar. Chelsea have launched a £16million bid for Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Douglas Costa . The Brazilian is tackled by Manchester United's Nemanja Vidic during a match in October 2013 . The 24-year-old has been capped by Brazil but has dual-Portuguese nationality and is eager to leave Ukraine and move to London. Shakhtar are notoriously difficult to negotiate with though and agreeing a fee will not be straightforward. Chelsea want quality replacements with Andre Schurrle and Mohamed Salah both looking to leave. Costa formed a formidable midfield partnership with Chelsea's Willian (right) while they were at Shakhtar . Costa celebrates scoring for Shakhtar during a Champions League match against Real Sociedad in 2013 . Fiorentina want £26.8m for Cuadrado, his release clause, and Chelsea have offered £20.6m and are willing to add the rest in bonuses. His agent Alessandro Lucci is due to hold further talks on Thursday. Costa began his career at Gremio where he caught the attention of European scouts, with Chelsea and Manchester United both making bids to sign him when he was 18. He opted to stay in Brazil for a season before joining Shakhtar in a surprise £6m transfer. However, he has continued to develop and is regarded as one of the best attacking midfielders in Europe. The thought of having two D Costas at Stamford Bridge will certainly whet the fans' appetite. The Brazilian would join another D Costa - Diego - at Stamford Bridge if he was to move to west London .

"A church is all that remains of the small village of San Juan Parangaricutiro in the state of Michoacán in Mexico. The town was completely blanketed after the eruption of Volcán de Parícutin in 1943. For the next eight years, lava flowed freely, burying the town underneath feet of volcanic rock - though its church survived unscathed. The volcanic eruption was particularly unique as its entire evolution was observed and studied. Many also consider this volcano, and adjacent lava-covered village, to be one of the natural wonders of the world. Under the church, houses and other buildings remain buried, though thankfully no residents were injured during the extended eruption. While some like to believe that it's ability to withstand the lava was an act from above, the solid slabs used to build the structure have also been credited. Even today, the haunting images show a stark contrast between the barren ground and the holy building. Scroll down for video .

"U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice has warned that the fight against the Islamic State will be a 'long-term effort' - and one in which  Iraq must take the lead. Speaking on NBC's 'Meet The Press', the 49-year-old said that ground troops will be a part of the campaign to combat the terror group, which has seized swathes of both Iraq and Syria. But she repeated administration pledges that they will be Iraqi forces - not American - saying: 'It's got to be the Iraqis. This is their fight. This is their territory.' Scroll down for video . Security adviser: Speaking on NBC's 'Meet The Press', Susan Rice (pictured) said that ground troops will be a part of the effort to combat ISIS. But she repeated administration pledges that they will be Iraqi forces . Air strike: Instead, Rice said that America would continue to 'do what we can from the air' to support the Iraqi and Kurdish security forces. Above, Thick smoke rises into the air following an airstrike in Kobani, Syria . She added: 'When we had over 100,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, it still came down to whether the Iraqis were willing and able to fight for their own country.' Instead, Rice said that America would continue to 'do what we can from the air' to support the Iraqi and Kurdish security forces in their fight to 'degrade and destroy' ISIS, also known as ISIL and IS. So far, the U.S.-led coalition has carried out more than 430 airstrikes on the militant group, which is currently approaching Baghdad, according to the U.S. Central Command. But Rice warned that we should not under-estimate the lengthy nature of the fight, saying: 'We are in the early stages of what is going to be, as President Obama has said, a long-term effort.' Militants: Rice said she hoped the new Iraqi government would rebuild the county's armed forces, which 'atrophied' under the rule of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.

President: She also warned that we should not under-estimate the lengthy nature of the fight, saying: 'We are in the early stages of what is going to be, as President Obama (pictured) has said, a long-term effort' During the conversation with Chuck Todd, Rice also said she hoped the new Iraqi government would rebuild the county's armed forces, which 'atrophied' under the rule of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Although this task 'is not going to be easy' and 'there is a long way to go', it would enable Iraq to battle ISIS on its own and take back territory from militants, she said. She added that the U.S. is not coordinating its military efforts with Iran, which has fallen into dispute with Washington over its nuclear program. The two countries are working 'very differently', she said. The U.S. military said yesterday it launched airstrikes north and west of Baghdad, hitting a small ISIS fighting unit and destroying armed vehicles. It said Britain participated in the airstrikes.

Above, smoke rises during today's fighting in Kobana . New York-based Human Rights Watch meanwhile said militants from ISIS are holding hundreds of Yazidi captives, including women and children, in detention facilities in Iraq and Syria. Based on accounts by relatives of detainees, it said the group has systematically separated young women and teenage girls from their families and has forced some of them to marry its fighters. Hundreds of people from the Yazidi religious minority were killed and tens of thousands were forced to flee for their lives after militants overran their hometown of Sinjar in north-west Iraq in August. Also today, activists claimed Kurdish fighters have halted ISIS’s advance in the Syrian border town of Kobani, where the U.S.-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes for two weeks. TV appearance: Rice made the comments during NBC's 'Meet The Press' with moderator Chuck Todd . The Syrian Kurdish enclave has been the scene of heavy fighting since last month, with the heavily armed ISIS fighters trying to capture the border post and deal a blow to the coalition air campaign. The extremist group has carved out a vast stretch of territory stretching hundreds of miles from northern Syria to the outskirts of Baghdad and imposed a harsh version of Islamic rule. The fighters have massacred hundreds of captured Iraqi and Syrian soldiers, terrorised religious minorities, and beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers. Since the offensive on Kobani began, 550 people have been killed, including about 300 ISIS fighters, 225 Kurdish gunmen and 20 civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. During today's NBC show, Rice also referred to the Ebola outbreak that has claimed the lives of more than 4,000 people across the world, mostly in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. She said other countries 'haven't done enough to help', adding: 'This is going to take all hands on deck, because the goal has to be to contain this epidemic in the three countries that we've seen in West Africa to try to prevent its spread and to provide the appropriate care to those that need it.' And in relation to the absence of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Rice said the administration has not seen any indications of a transfer of power at present.","U.S. National Security Adviser warns fight against ISIS will be 'long-term'

"A former beauty queen turned prostitute has been convicted of possessing drugs after trying to swallow her stash of cocaine. Natalie Gentle, 32, who was once a contestant in a 'Face of 2007' competition, started working as as prostitute from her home in Plymouth, Devon, after she spiralled into a life of drugs. Police were waiting outside her home in the Ernesettle area of the city when she pulled up outside her flat in a taxi. Natalie Gentle, 32, was once a contestant in Plymouth's 'Face of 2007' competition (right) but she started working as a prostitute from her flat in the city after spiralling into a life of drugs (left, arriving at court) When she noticed them she was spotted slipping something into her mouth and after officers asked her to open it they discovered it was a wrap of cocaine. Plymouth Crown Court heard that when police found the Class A drug she said: 'It's only personal, it's only £20 worth'. After raiding her home they also uncovered items including a pipe, tin foil and a knife and she was later evicted after plaguing her neighbours with her sexual activities. Gentle pleaded guilty in court to possession and was given a two-year conditional discharge. Alistair Verheijen, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'On August 6 police attended Miss Gentle's residence but she wasn't home. 'The police officers saw her arrive, and noted that she had noticed them. Immediately her body language changed, and she put something into her mouth. She admitted possession of cocaine after police found her trying to hide a 'wrap' in her mouth . 'Police asked her to open her mouth where they found a wrap. She then said - ""it's only personal, it's only £20 worth"". 'Examination later revealed that the wrap contained 0.47g of cocaine.' Gentle was a contestant in the '2007 Face Of Plymouth' event but started using her flat in the city for prostitution. In 2010 she was given an ASBO banning men from entering her property but was earlier this year evicted after ongoing anti-social behaviour. Defending, Will Rose, explained how Miss Gentle was a recovering heroin addict, with other medical ailments. He said: 'She has managed to steer clear for two and a half years, although she does suffer from other medical conditions. 'She was on a course of methadone but she has now been off that for seven days.' Judge Alan Large, said: 'I have only one option for this case and that is conditional discharge, and that is far too lenient in my opinion. 'You need to understand that if you are back here again with a record like this you will go to prison.' Last month, Plymouth magistrates evicted the former pole dancer and beauty queen contestant from her flat, after neighbours had complained. They claimed there was constant noise and for five years had men knocking on their doors and shouting through their letter boxes asking 'where the prostitute is?'. During her eviction appearance at magistrates, prosecutor Dylan Sadler told Gentle: 'You are a prostitute, men visit that premises as you offer that service and you use this to finance a heroin habit. 'You are fully aware that dealing drugs goes on from your premises and it causes immense problems for people living around you.'","Natalie Gentle was a contestant in Plymouth's 'Face of 2007' competition .

"Newly released footage from the Ferguson, Missouri, police department recorded on the day of Michael Brown's fatal shooting shows officer Darren Wilson emerging from the building on his way to the hospital just hours after the deadly encounter with the unarmed teenager. The brief video recording has been provided by the Ferguson police to the St Louis Post-Dispatch Friday in response to a formal freedom of information act request. The first clip shows the officer in plainclothes, dressed in a white T-shirt and dark pants, leaving the police precinct with two other men on his way to the hospital. Scroll down for videos . Same day: The Post-Dispatch obtained footage showing Darren Wilson, left, leaving the Ferguson police station hours after the killing of Michael Brown . Wilson, seen left and right, was caught on camera emerging from the police precinct dressed in a white T-shirt en route to a hospital . Another video depicts the Ferguson cop returning to the police headquarters two and a half hours later. Mr Wilson has not been seen publicly since he was photographed standing over Brown’s lifeless body on August 9. Therefore, the video of Wilson's return to the police precinct that night marks the last time he was caught on camera. Along with the videos, the Post-Dispatch Friday published transcripts of radio recordings from the Brown shooting, showing that the teen was gunned down less than a minute and a half after first encountering Wilson. . Audio from the moments before and after Darren Wilson opened fired on Brown, 18, were also obtained under Missouri's freedom of information laws. Combined with other accounts from the day, the radio accounts seem to show that Brown was dead on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, just over a minute after Wilson said that he was about to confront him. Among the released audio records, however, the Post-Dispatch has been unable to locate the call Wilson has claimed he'd made to the dispatcher after firing the first shot at Brown. Cameras caught the embattled cop emerging from the police station in the company of two other men . Safe haven: He returned to the headquarters in Ferguson two and a half hours later . Mr Wilson has not been seen publicly since he was photographed standing over Brown’s lifeless body . Final glimpse: This marks the last time Wilson has been seen in public since August . At 12.02pm on 9 August, Wilson said: '21. Put me on Canfield with two. And send me another car.' Canfield is the name of the street where the shooting happened, and two is a reference to the fact Brown was with a friend. By 12.03pm a tweet from a bystander had been posted, saying: 'I JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE'. According to Analysis by the Post-Dispatch, this means the encounter could have lasted as little as 61 seconds. The recordings provide new fragments of information on the hotly-contested encounter, which has sparked a wave of protests and accusations of racism. Leaked accounts of Wilson's version of events tell of Brown attacking Wilson in his police SUV and almost knocking him out - before the officer manages to grab his gun and fire. Contrary to accounts of Brown surrendering, the accounts of Wilson's statements say the teen 'charged' even after he was shot. About 30 minute before the shooting, at 11.29am, a police dispatcher sent Darren Wilson as reinforcement in a domestic violence case, followed by a call about a sick baby. At 11.53am, Wilson hears over his radio a report about a 'stealing in progress' at the Ferguson Market. The dispatcher then gives a description of the suspect: a black male in a white T-shirt running toward QuikTrip bodega with a box of stolen Swisher-brand cigars. Killed: Michael Brown, 18, (left) was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson (right) in Ferguson, Missouri. New recordings seem to show the encounter was over in barely a minute . Aftermath: Wilson is seen standing over the slain Brown,  moments after firing on him repeatedly . The dispatcher later offers more detail on the suspect, saying that he is wearing a red Cardinals hat, yellow socks and khaki shorts, and that he is accompanied by another man. At noon, Wilson radios in that he is back on duty and asks his fellow officers searching for the suspects in the theft if they require assistance. Seven seconds later, he learns that the suspects have disappeared. Two minutes later, Officer Wilson contacts the dispatcher telling him that he is on Canfield with two suspects in his sights and is in need of assistance. Sources told the Post-Dispatch that before he made the report, Wilson allegedly told Michael Brown and his companion, Dorian Johnson, to stop walking in the middle of the street, but they ignored his plea, at which point he realized that one of them, Brown, matched the description of the suspected cigar thief. While waiting for backup, Wilson said that Brown attacked him first and a struggle ensued, with the teenager grabbing for his gun. Wilson was eventually able to squeeze out two shots from his service weapon, hitting Brown once and prompting him to flee. Demonstrations: Brown's death sparked protests and vigils in Ferguson, where riot police officers came toe-to-toe with furious activists accusing them of racial violence . Wilson would later tell investigators that immediately after the shooting he called in, ‘Shots fired, send all cars,' but during the struggle the channel on his radio switched, so the call never went through. The Post-Dispatch reviewed recordings made on other radio channels in Ferguson at the time but could not find a trace of Wilson's call. The newspaper noted that at least one channel on the police radio was 'receive-only.' The officer then jumped out of his car and went in pursuit of Brown. According to Wilson, the teenager stopped in his tracks, reversed course and charged at him, prompting the cop to fire a shot, followed by several more after a brief pause. When the 18-year-old collapsed to the ground, Wilson called for an ambulance . Some accounts say that Wilson choked Brown and tried to drag him into the SUV, while others say he was shot in the back while fleeing. Witnesses have said he was raising his hands in submission. At 12.07pm, about four minutes after the deadly encounter, a woman could be heard wailing in the background as an officer who arrived on the scene as backup radioed in: 'Get us several more units over here. There’s gonna be a problem.' A grand jury is currently deliberating on whether to indict Wilson over the shooting, and is expected to make its decision this month. If Wilson is not indicted, he can expect his job back immediately, although his next assignment is yet to be determined, Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson told Yahoo! News. Conversely, if charged with a felony, Wilson would probably be terminated, the chief said. On Saturday, Jackson spoke to the press clarifying his earlier remarks about Wilson's employment status. 'I am not saying that I want Officer Wilson to return or that I don’t want him to return,' Jackson told msnbc. 'Legally speaking, if he is not indicted he can return to his job. If he is indicted on felony charges, which these would be, he will be fired. 'But even if he is not indicted he will be subject to an internal investigation,” Jackson added. The results of that investigation, according to Jackson, may or may not lead to Wilson’s termination.' Brown's parents have insisted that there is enough evidence to indict Wilson and put him on trial, but according to unnamed police sources, the grand jury is unlikely to take that step. 'Intimidation': The Brown family has also demanded that Missouri's Governor apologize for the treatment of protesters, who were met with a heavy police presence . Attorneys for the family released a statement Saturday in response to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch story, criticizing the police. 'From the very beginning, the Ferguson Police Dept. has followed what is now seemingly standard operating procedure for police departments around the country: to vilify the victim and put the shooter on a pedestal,' the statement said. 'Information was leaked from within the police department that Wilson was severely beaten and suffered an orbital eye socket ""blowout,"" indicating that Michael Brown somehow deserved to die. 'From the video released today it would appear the initial descriptions of his injuries were exaggerated. 'The audio clearly demonstrates that the initial interaction with the officer and Brown had nothing to do with the incident at the convenience store. The remaining portions of the audiotape did not establish any connection with the convenience store incident.","Newly obtained surveillance footage shows Darren Wilson, wearing a T-shirt, leaving the Ferguson police station hours after the killing .

"If they hide their faces the sentence can be increased to three years jail, and a 45,000 euro fine . France's Socialist government provoked outrage today by becoming the first in the world to ban protests against Israeli action in Palestine. In what is viewed as an outrageous attack on democracy, Socialist Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said mass demonstrations planned for the weekend should be halted. Mr Cazeneuve said there was a ‘threat to public order’, while opponents said he was ‘criminalising’ popular support of the Palestinian people. Scroll down for video . Pro-Palestinian demonstrators take to the streets of Paris on Sunday. France's socialist government has sparked uproar after it banned protests against Israeli action in Palestine . Thousands were set to march against the ongoing slaughter in Gaza, calling for an immediate end to hostilities in which civilians including many children have been killed. But Mr Cazeneuve fears there might be a repeat of the fights between ‘ultra’ Jewish vigilantes and pro-Palestinians which happened after a demonstration last Sunday. Referring to the main Paris march, Mr Cazeneuve said: ‘I consider that the conditions are not right to guarantee security.’ Socialist Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve fears there might be a repeat of the fights between Jewish vigilantes and pro-Palestinians which happened after a demonstration last Sunday . He welcomed a legal procedure instigated by the Paris police prefecture to ban the march, despite it already being widely advertised. Anyone who turns up to an illegal demonstration now faces up to a year in prison, and a 15,000 euro fine. If they hide their faces to avoid being identified, this sentence can be increased to three years, and a 45,000 fine. Even those who publish details of an illegal rally on social media face up to a year in prison, and a 15,000 euro fine. This can be increased to seven years and a 100,000 fine if the postings lead to violence. Mr Cazeneuve also advised other prefects across France to examine planned marches on a ‘case by case’ basis, and to ban ‘if appropriate’. But Michele Sibony, of the Jewish Union for Peace, said: ‘By outlawing free speech by pro-Palestinian demonstrators, France puts itself in a unique position in the world and Europe.’ And Youssef Boussoumah, of the Party of the Indigenous of the Republic (PIR) said: ‘France is criminalising any show of solidarity with the Palestinian people. ‘This is an absolute outrage, it is a continuation of attempts to muzzle the Palestinian people and to get them and their supporters in France to surrender absolutely to Israel's oppression.’ Sylvie Perrot, another pro-Palestine activist from Paris, said: ‘Fascist states stop people demonstrating against wars – it is beyond belief that French Socialists are following their example.’ There were false claims made last week that synagogues in Paris had been targeted by pro-Palestinian demonstrators. In fact videos showed armed vigilantes from a group called the Jewish Defence League (LDJ) baiting demonstrators into fights.

A judicial enquiry is set to be launched into the false allegations made about the synagogue attacks – ones which people claim were made up to demonise supporters of Palestine by associating them with anti-Semitism.

"They may have fled to safety, but these Syrian Kurds can't help but look back over the border they just crossed to watch their brothers-in-arms fight for the land they left behind. In the last week alone, more than 150,000 Kurdish men, women and children have crossed into Sanlinurfa, Turkey, to escape the  Islamic State fighters laying siege to their hometown, Kobani, some 15 miles to the south. But while they are now safe, the war rages on as Kurdish Peshmerga warriors - backed by U.S. airstrikes - fight to hold their murderous enemy at bay. Nervous: They may have escaped to freedom, but these Syrian Kurds can't help but look back over the border they just crossed to cheer on their brothers fighting back the jihadis overrunning their homeland . What they could see: This is how close the town of Ayn al-Arab is to the Turkish border . Close contact: In Sanlinurfa, Turkey, men climbed a hill with binoculars and watched the battle for the town of Ayn al-Arab unfold little more than a mile in the distance . Fear for their homes: Some 15 miles beyond that, smoke could be seen rising from Kobani, from which many of these refugees fled when the IS horde breached the town's defences . Smoke rising: Smoke rises from Ayn al-Arab city following shelling during clashes between Islamic State  and Kurdish armed troops . In Sanlinurfa, men climbed a hill with binoculars and nervously watched  the battle for the town of Ayn al-Arab unfold little more than a mile in the distance. Some 15 miles beyond that, they could see smoke rising from  Kobani, the town from which most of these refugees fled when the IS horde breached the town's defences. Turkey had taken in well over a million Syrian refugees from the three-and-a-half year-old conflict already before the latest wave, but this influx is the largest yet, according to the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR. Several hundred thousand refugees are reportedly still in Kobani and aid agencies are bracing for a massive exodus into Turkey. U.S.-led airstrikes and soldiers from the Peshmerga have managed to hold the brutal Islamic extremists back for now, but there are fears they could still take the town. If that happens, many Kurds fear they will be massacred in the same way the Yazidis were after IS fighters seized Sinjar last month, forcing them to scatter into the hills. Safe at last: Some 150,000 Kurdish men, women and children have already crossed into Sanlinurfa, Turkey, to escape the onslaught on Kobani by Islamic State fighters . Influx: Syrian refugees carry their belongings at a border crossing point after crossing from Syria into Turkey in Yumurtalik, south of Sanliurfa, Turkey .

So they fled to Turkey where they were met by barbed wire, soldiers and tanks as fears over the scale of this refugee crisis grew. Turkish tanks took up positions along the Syrian frontier, opposite besieged Kobani where Islamic State shelling intensified and stray fire hit Turkish soil. U.S.-led air strikes overnight hit a natural gas plant controlled by Islamic State fighters in eastern Syria, a monitoring body reported, part of an apparent campaign to disrupt one of the fighters' main sources of income. The monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said planes also struck a grain silo in northern Syria killing civilians. This could not be immediately confirmed.

Turkish tanks took up positions along the Syrian frontier, opposite besieged Kobani where Islamic State shelling intensified and stray fire hit Turkish soil (above) More tanks: At least 15 Turkish tanks were positioned at the frontier, some with guns pointed towards Syrian territory . U.S.-led strikes have so far failed to halt an advance by fighters in northern Syria on Kobani, a Kurdish town on the border with Turkey where the past week's battle caused the fastest refugee flight of Syria's three-year civil war. At least 15 Turkish tanks were positioned at the frontier, some with guns pointed towards Syrian territory. More tanks and armoured vehicles moved towards the border after shells landed in Turkey on Sunday and Monday. Among the 150,000 Kurds to arrive in Turkey in the last week is Mohammed Muslim. Dressed in a battered suit, his moustache flecked . with grey, he is distraught about having to leave, but fears what would have happened to him if he had stayed. 'I don't want to be in Turkey, I want to be in my village, I . want to die in Kobani,' Muslim said, running prayer beads . through his hands as he watched Kurdish and Islamic State . fighters exchange fire in the valley below.' He added: 'If the war goes our way, then of course we'll go home, but . it looks like it will be difficult.' Turkish police in the area have another fight on their hands as hundreds of Turkish Kurds descend on the Syria-Turkey frontier in the hope of joining the fight against IS .

President Tayyip Erdogan, until now reluctant to commit to a . frontline military role in the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic .

"Close friends of Darren Wilson have called for the star witness in the Michael Brown shooting to be charged for lying about what he saw. Two of the Ferguson police officer’s best friends told MailOnline that Dorian Johnson - who was next to Brown at the time - should be arrested for his statements in numerous TV interviews he made days afterwards. They say that he made up the claim that Brown had his hands up which kickstarted the ‘Hands up, don’t shoot’ protest movement. For his part Johnson told the grand jury that the whole process has left him feeling ‘victimized’. He also revealed that the altercation began because he didn’t like how Wilson spoke to him like a father telling off his son. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dorian Johnson (right) was with Michael Brown the day the 18-year-old was shot dead by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson. He spoke out on Tuesday, saying he was 'very upset' with a grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson on any charges. Pictured above with his attorney James Williams (left) Darren Wilson: Friends of the officer say that Dorian Johnson, who led the accusations which prompted protests over Michael Brown's death, should be charged. Secret wedding: On Monday morning, it was revealed that 28-year-old Wilson (left) - who hasn't been seen in public since the shooting - quietly married his fellow officer, Barbara Spradling (right), 37, last month . Johnson was walking with Brown back to his house in Ferguson, Missouri, when he and Wilson got in tussle that ended in tragedy on August 9. The killing sparked more than a week of violent protest and trouble erupted again this week with looting and widespread vandalism when a Grand Jury decided not to indict Wilson. The decision effectively means they did not believe Johnson’s account. Afterwards, Wilson’s testimony was made public which his supporters say proves Johnson was a liar. A close friend said: ‘Dorian Johnson is the one who started it all. If it was up to me he should be charged. ‘He got right on CNN, he got right on TV and started blabbering his mouth off. I could tell by his voice that he was lying. ‘Darren Wilson’s story makes sense regardless of whether I knew him or not.’ The friend also criticized Johnson for claiming that he hid behind a car but also claimed to have seen everything that happened. The friend said: ‘That’s just not possible’. In his TV interviews after Brown’s death on CNN and MSNBC Johnson said that Wilson told him and Brown to ‘get the f***onto the sidewalk’ as he drove past in his police SUV. Shots fired: Michael Brown was shot several times by Officer Darren Wilson in the St Louis suburb on August 9, sparking months of protests . Thank you: Darren Wilson has written to friends and supports to thank them for being on his side since the shooting. The letter was leaked yesterday. But in his interview at the St Louis County police department on August 10, the day after he killed Brown Wilson said that he asked them both: ‘Hey guys, why don’t you walk on the sidewalk?’ Johnson is said to have replied: ‘F*** what you have to say’. In his TV interviews Johnson said that Wilson shot Brown in the back at which point he turned round with his hands up saying: ‘I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!’ Wilson however said that Brown charged at him looking like a ‘demon’ who did not stop until he hit him with the last of six bullets, which went into his head. Johnson vanished soon after making his interviews and has only resurfaced once in a brief interview on CNN. His credibility was further damaged after it emerged that he had previous convictions for theft and filing a false police report. The close friend of Wilson’s told MailOnline that they feared for Wilson’s future and that he might not be able to return to a normal life. Wilson had only celebrated his housewarming with his future wife Barbara Spradling and her five-year-old son a month before he shot Brown. Prior to joining the police force Wilson worked as a carpenter and this is something he could go back to, or perhaps working in a smaller, more rural force. The second friend said: ‘He’s a good person. I used to go bowling with him and he’s one of the nicest guys I know’. Death: Michael Brown was shot dead by Wilson on August 9. The community of Ferguson, Missouri erupted in violence Monday night after the grand jury's decision was announced . Outcry: Michael Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden, seen in a white beanie and sunglasses, being held by a man in a green baseball shirt, collapsed after hearing the decision Monday night not to indict Wilson . The victim's stepfather (center) screamed 'Burn this b**** down' as he stood next to Brown's mother . The first friend added: ‘I knew from day one that Darren would not be indicted. I knew he did nothing wrong… . ‘...he’s very good at putting on a brave face but I know it’s killing him. The initial altercation . Johnson: Wilson reversed back quickly, screeched to a halt and said: ‘What the f*** did you say?’ Wilson: Reversed back calmly and asked: ‘Hey guys, why don’t you walk on the sidewalk?’ The tussle in the car . Johnson: Brown was never inside the vehicle, never punched the officer and did not have his hands on the gun. Wilson had his hands on Brown’s neck. Wilson: Brown suddenly punched him and ‘completely overpowered’ him before grabbing his gun and turning it towards the officer’s hip. The pursuit and the shooting . Johnson: Brown ran off three car lengths and stopped as the second shot hit him in the back. He turned around and was ‘riddled with bullets’ before he could move. Wilson: Claims he only fired when Brown was facing him. Says Brown kept running towards him and would not stop until the sixth round went into his body. Were Brown’s hands up? Johnson: Yes. One hand was raised slightly above the other. Wilson: No. Says that it would be ‘incorrect’ to say that. The justification . Johnson: It could have been resolved without deadly force. Told the jury: ‘We definitely wasn’t posing a threat to his life’. Wilson: Says he acted within the law because he was in fear of his life. Says his conscience is clear: it was him or me. ‘I am sure that he sees it all, he sees it all happen in his mind every night before he goes to sleep’. Should Johnson be arrested the charge he would face would be perjury, but it appears to be very unlikely. As he announced the jury’s decision not to charge Wilson, St Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCullough was asked if there were grounds to take action against any of the witnesses. He said no but in his speech he lambasted some of those who gave evidence, without naming Johnson directly. He said: ‘Some witnesses maintained their original statement that Mr Brown had his hands in the air and was not moving toward the officer when he was shot. ‘Several witnesses said Mr Brown did not raise his hands at all or that he raised them briefly and then dropped them and then turned toward Officer Wilson, who then fired several rounds.’ Johnson’s testimony before the grand jury is broadly the same as what he said during his TV interviews. It does however reveal numerous new details about the incident and the alleged robbery Brown carried out minutes before at a convenience store. Johnson told the panel that after grabbing a handful of cigarillos and pushing the clerk out the way he ‘laughed it off’ as they walked outside without paying. He and Brown did not get out of the road when Wilson asked him to because he felt the officer was like a ‘father talking to kids’. Johnson agreed that what they were doing was ‘defiant, a show of strength’ and told the jury his thoughts were: ‘We’re not your kids’. After the shooting Johnson ran back to his house to change his clothes and admitted it was so that the police did not recognise him and arrest him over the convenience store robbery. He told the grand jury that he felt ‘victimised’ and that there were so many rumours that people thought he had been killed when a body was found nearby. Johnson told the jury that ‘deadly force was really not necessary’ and that Brown ‘could be in jail right now’ if things had been different. He said: ‘All I’m saying is the gun is definitely out of order. Could have been a taser, anything that make someone stop… . ‘...he (Wilson) could have pulled out the billy club to show he was going to use force if we didn’t stop.’","Dorian Johnson initially said that his friend had put his hands in the air and said to Darren Wilson: 'I don't have a gun, stop shooting.'

"George Ford brought England's autumn to life with an impressive full debut as Samoa were swept aside 28-9 at Twickenham to end the 2015 World Cup hosts' five-match losing run. Ford - making his first start at fly-half with Owen Farrell switching to inside centre - rose to the occasion superbly, kicking with intelligence, offering a threat in attack and showing surprising resilience in the face of some brutal defence from the Pacific Islanders. The 21-year-old kicked 13 points and played a key role in setting up a try for Mike Brown in a performance that demands his selection in the climax to the QBE Series against Australia next Saturday . Sportsmail's Chris Foy rates the players' performances. England . Mike Brown - 6.5 . Spilled pass from Ford to squander early try chance but grew into the game. One stunning take from a high kick late on. Anthony Watson - 7 . Dynamic early run on the right helped him to settle. Superb in-field burst and off-load for Brown try. An encouraging display. Brad Barritt - 5 . Warned for blocking in first half and that was arguably his most notable attacking contribution. Tackled and chased, not much else. Jonny May scores England's second try under pressure from Alapati Leiua of Samoa . Owen Farrell - 6 . Better. Clever inter-change with Ford for May’s first try. One or two unusual defensive lapses and fumbles but slightly more assured. Jonny May - 7.5 . Try double was just reward for explosive efforts, despite blood injuries. Showcased his blistering pace and always looking to exploit gaps. George Ford - 8 . Fine first start. Kept taking big hits and playing flat to line. Clever late passes, nimble running and fine tactical kicking. Deserves to keep shirt. England's George Ford breaks away from Maatuilmanu Leiatua of Samoa . Ben Youngs - 5.5 . Put under pressure at the base of scrums and rucks, and his service and kicking were mixed. No significant sniping threat . Joe Marler - 6 . Made his presence felt in a dominant set piece and also put in some telling tackles but found the ball too slippery at times. Rob Webber - 6.5 . Not prominent around the field but the lineout functioned well so he delivered in his primary role and kept competing gamely. Anthony Watson of England breaks through the Samoa defence at Twickenham . David Wilson - 6.5 . Led the early scrum assault and produced a crucial retrieval in his own 22 when England were under pressure. Solid. Dave Attwood - 6 . Another stalwart of the impressive lineout who was at the heart of England’s best driving surges. Late fumble in front of the line. Courtney Lawes - 5.5 . Not his greatest game. Was a typically reliable lineout option but no real carrying impact and some shaky handling in first half. James Haskell - 5.5 . His first act was to concede a penalty and the Wasps captain found it hard to impose himself at the breakdown or in open play. Ben Morgan - 5 . Early run led to fumble and he didn’t carry with typical clout. Missed tackle allowed Ken Pisi to break in second half. Chris Robshaw (capt) - 7 . Named as Man of the Match for a dogged performance at close quarters. Tackled, grafted, never eased off. England's Brad Barritt goes to ground after being tackled on Saturday . Replacements . George Kruis on for Lawes, 54. Matt Mullan for Marler, 59. Kieran Brookes for Wilson, 59. Marland Yarde for May, 61. Richard Wigglesworth for Youngs, 64. Billy Twelvetrees for Farrell, 65. Tom Wood for Haskell, 68. Dylan Hartley on for Webber, 70. Yarde briefly cut loose on the left during his first-half cameo as a blood replacement, but he wasted a chance for a late counter-attack try. Kruis produced a couple of strong drives. Twelvetrees charged around with great gusto and energy at the end. Samoa .

"Under a cloud: Investigators found no conclusive evidence whether Christie was aware or not of the closures of lanes on George Washington Bridge in September 2013 that caused gridlock in the town of Fort Lee . New Jersey lawmakers probing politically motivated traffic jams near the George Washington Bridge last year have been unable to rule out that that Gov. Chris Christie was involved in the scandal. They have been trying to determine who ordered traffic lanes to be blocked in September 2013 at the bridge and why. The closures caused gridlock in Fort Lee, the town at the base of the heavily traveled span linking New Jersey and New York, and appear to have been directed at the town's mayor, a Democrat who did not endorse Christie. Christie has always denied any wrongdoing. And yesterday investigators found no conclusive evidence whether Christie was aware or not of the closures, but they say that two former Christie aides acted with 'perceived impunity' and with little regard for public safety when they ordered the lanes closed. The findings came in a 136-page interim report by a joint legislative panel, released yesterday. 'At present, there is no conclusive evidence as to whether Governor Chris Christie was or was not aware of the lane closures either in advance of their implementation or contemporaneously as they were occurring,' states the report. 'Nor is there conclusive evidence as to whether Governor Christie did or did not have involvement in implementing or directing the lane closures.' A report commissioned by Christie previously cleared him of any wrongdoing and a lawyer for the governor said in a statement yesterday that the report corroborates that investigation. 'The Committee has finally acknowledged what we reported nine months ago - namely, that there is not a shred of evidence Governor Christie knew anything about the GWB lane realignment beforehand or that any current member of his staff was involved in that decision,' Christie attorney Randy Mastro said in a statement. Suspicions: The closures caused gridlock in Fort Lee, the town at the base of the heavily traveled span linking New Jersey and New York (pictured), and appear to have been directed at the town's mayor, a Democrat who did not endorse Christie . The report said that several critical witnesses have not testified and that important questions remain unanswered. The report will be supplemented if more information is obtained. The report says that former Christie aides Bridge Anne Kelly and David Wildstein acted with 'perceived impunity' and that they acted with little regard for public safety. It says that the Christie administration responded 'very slowly and passively' to the lane closures. Documents released earlier this year showed that Wildstein, then an official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Kelly, then an aide to Christie, orchestrated the shutdown, apparently as retribution toward Fort Lee's Democratic mayor. Unanswered questions: The report said that several critical witnesses have not testified and that important questions remain unanswered. The report will be supplemented if more information is obtained . In one email, Kelly told Wildstein, 'Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.' Wildstein later contended that Christie knew about the lane closures as they happened. Christie, a possible 2016 Republican presidential contender, denies that he had any role in or knowledge of a plot to shut down the lanes. An investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office is continuing. No one has been charged. The legislative panel is scheduled to meet on Monday to formally release the report to the public.","In September 2013, George Washington Bridge lanes shut causing gridlock .

"CLICK HERE to see Chris Foy's full England player ratings from Twickenham . Job done, boxed ticked. England finally registered the win they craved but huge questions remain over Stuart Lancaster’s team and their ability to challenge at next year’s World Cup. This was always going to be a thankless task against cash-strapped opponents whose preparation was overshadowed by their ongoing dispute with a dysfunctional union which nearly led to the players boycotting the match. But there was an opportunity to show progress had been made and lessons had been learned following a dismal start to the autumn series. In the end they did enough, just.

Three tries, two of them in an improved second-half performance, were the least England would have expected following criticism of their attacking efforts in the QBE international defeats against New Zealand and South Africa. The experiment of playing George Ford at fly-half, with the misfiring Owen Farrell shifted to inside centre, was no more than a partial success. Ford, on his first start for England, was quietly impressive, riding thunderous tackles — one of which led to a yellow card for Samoa centre John Leota — to finish the game comfortably in credit. The 21-year-old amassed 13 points, landing five kicks from seven attempts, and played a hand in England’s first two tries. He will surely start against Australia in the pivotal No 10 position next Saturday. Lancaster said: ‘There’s a lot of pressure to come on and run a game but I thought George did it well. He looked incisive in his line breaks, he’s got a great eye for the gap and his kicking game was good. He took some hits and showed a great deal of bravery. It was a really positive first start for him. ‘We have a selection decision to make but from my point of view he’s been waiting patiently for his chance and he’s put a real marker down.’ Whether Farrell starts alongside him is less certain. Fortunate to retain his place following two under-par displays, the 23-year-old made a couple of neat contributions yesterday, including a cleverly weighted pass from a wrap-around move which led to the first of Jonny May’s two tries. But the jury remains out. His kicking remains a concern and his lack of confidence is evident. The pair will need time to forge an understanding at 10 and 12 — time England may not have with nine games left before the World Cup. England will point to the fact two of their three tries were scored by left wing May, while his fellow wing Anthony Watson set up Mike Brown’s try following a brilliant cross-field kick by Ford. But too much of the team’s play was stuttering and lacking cohesion. The England team walk through crowds of supporters after arriving at Twickenham .

Coming into the game with five successive losses behind them, and five changes in personnel, it was understandable that nerves would play a part in the early stages. But the first 40 minutes will not live long in the memory — bar May’s well-worked try — as England again produced an error-strewn display that saw them go in 13-6 up at half-time. Mercifully they picked up their game in the second half as Ford kicked deeper into Samoa territory but, with their vastly superior conditioning and preparation, England should have pulled clear with far more authority than they did. Lancaster’s men blew three clear try-scoring chances, full back Mike Brown dropping two and lock Dave Attwood knocking on with the line at his mercy minutes from time after another sharp break from Ford. They would surely have been punished against better opposition. Lancaster added: ‘I’m obviously pleased to get the win because it’s been a while coming. I’m delighted first and foremost with that and also really pleased with the performances of some young players who are making early starts in their careers. Particularly George and Anthony Watson. ‘It was a shame we didn’t take some of those opportunities at the end. They’re the ones we will need to take against Australia.’ Lancaster and his coaching team were taken aback by the ferocity of the criticism following the first two defeats of the autumn but, make no mistake, losing next week to a tired and under-strength Wallaby outfit would leave him facing a horrendous build-up to the Six Nations. No one doubts the work ethic or desire of the coach or his team but only consistently high-quality, high-tempo displays will keep the wolves at bay and avoid a scenario like yesterday when a near capacity crowd resorted to the dreaded Mexican Wave less than 15 minutes in. It was a clear sign they were bored. No amount of invented pageantry or heavy handed marketing can replace the crowd’s desire for blood and thunder on the pitch. As James Haskell said this week, no one will remember how good England’s culture is if they don’t win any matches. They will need to improve to beat the Wallabies next week. Too many players failed to leave a mark on this game, with Haskell knocking on too often, Ben Morgan struggling to make an impact and Brad Barritt unable to provide any real thrust alongside Ford and Farrell in the outside centre position. Scrum-half Ben Youngs was quiet while hooker Rob Webber did not carry as Lancaster may have hoped. Brown was also guilty of those two dropped passes when the try line was in view, although his pass to set up May’s second was sweetly executed and he otherwise enjoyed a tidy game. But tidy is not enough for England. They need to demonstrate an ability to tear sides to pieces. There is little threat of that at the moment.

"Michael Brown's family could sue Darren Wilson or the Ferguson Police Department over the 'flawed' decision not to indict the police officer who fatally shot the teenager. An attorney for the Brown family said the grand jury proceedings which failed to indict Wilson, who shot the unarmed 18-year-old, left open the possibility they could pursue a civil rights case. Daryl Parks said the use of certain words and adjectives, including 'demonic' to describe Brown, could prove a racial component in the incident and determine a civil rights violation. Scroll down for video . Daryl Parks, an attorney for the Brown family, said they could pursue a civil rights case against Darren Wilson . Michael Brown, left, was shot dead in broad daylight by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, pictured right a day after the killing in August. A grand jury chose not to indict him . He told Fox News: 'When I tell you about the words he [Wilson] used to describe Michael Brown. 'He uses demonic, demon. I don't think you have to use the actual words for it to be racial.' He added: 'What it does is cast Michael Brown in a negative light.' Mr Parks said that both sides needed to be given the chance to work out their differences, but the matter could be settled with litigation if needed. He explained his concern with the grand jury proceedings was that Wilson should not have been allowed to present his defense. Michael Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr, appeared on CBS last week where they said they ' don't believe a word' of Darren Wilson's account of shooting dead their teenage son . Michael Brown's father and mother, Lesley McSpadden, reacted with fury to Officer Wilson's first interview last week, saying: 'I don't think he wanted to kill my son but he wanted kill someone.' Michael Brown Sr said the decision not to indict Wilson reinforced to him that he was living in a 'racist state'. Ms McSpadden said: 'He [Wilson] says that his conscience is clear. How can your conscience be clear after killing somebody even after it was accidental death?' Yesterday, veteran civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton preached to a congregation of around 2,500 worshippers at the St Louis church where Michael Brown's funeral was held in August. The dead teen's parents were among the congregation. But Neil Bruntager, an attorney for Wilson, said the Brown family have the right to pursue a case - but will have a 'difficult row to hoe'. Unrest shows no sign of dying down in St Louis, where Bishop Derrick Robinson was arrested yesterday . Wilson, a white police officer, shot Brown dead after an encounter in Ferguson, Missouri, in August and last week, a St Louis Country grand jury chose not to indict Wilson. Brown's death galvanized critics of the way police and the criminal justice system treat African-Americans and other minority groups, sparking protests and riots across the country. On Saturday, Wilson resigned from his position amid concerns about his safety. And yesterday, Ferguson's Mayor James Knowles vowed to rebuilt his riot-torn town.

"Grieving friends and relatives of the murdered Miss Honduras beauty queen and her sister have said goodbye at a double funeral. Maria Jose Alvarado,19, was shot twice in the back as she tried to flee after seeing her sister, Sofia, 23, shot by her jealous boyfriend, police say. In heartbreaking scenes the sisters' mother,Teresa Muñoz, hugged the two wooden caskets after they were bought to her home at dawn. More than 300 people attended the service, before the two women were buried in cement lined graves in a tiny cemetery near their hometown of Santa Barbara. 'We are going to miss you; you will live in our hearts forever,' said 26-year-old Corina Alvarado, the victims' elder sister. Miss Alvarado and her sister Sofia were allegedly killed by Plutarco Antonio Ruiz - who flew into a jealous rage after seeing his girlfriend dance with another man. Yesterday army soldiers and forensic teams recovered the bodies of the sisters buried in a river bank close to the spa where they disappeared six days ago. Scroll down for video .

Army soldiers today retrieved the bodies of Maria Jose Alvarado (pictured) and her 23-year-old sister Sofia from a ditch near the Aguagua river in Santa Barbara six days after they went missing from a birthday outing . Dozens of friends and relatives of the teenage beauty gathered for a candlelight vigil at the college she attended yesterday, remembering the down-to-earth young woman who dreamed of becoming a diplomat and who worked as a model to help support her poor family. Ludin Reyes, a fellow student at the Technical University of Honduras, told Fox News: 'She was a simple, humble, a total innocent smiling and without malice.' Yesterday the girls' devastated mother Teresa Munoz, told Televicentro that her daughters were tragically too trusting and friendly for their own good. She said: 'They were not very astute about assessing the people around them. They were just friendly. They were going out with people they hadn't known very long.' She claimed Ruiz called her the following morning, acting nervous and claiming the young women had left the party in a car with some other people. General Ramon Sabillon, the National Police director, said Sofia's boyfriend Plutarco Antonio Ruiz had confessed to the killings on Tuesday and led authorities to the bodies in a mountainous area in Santa Barbara. Beauty queen Maria Jose Alvarado, 19, was due to compete in this year's Miss World competition in London . The bodies were found near La Aguagua spa, where the sisters had gone last Thursday to celebrate Ruiz's birthday. Forensic experts could be seen carrying the body of Sofia, who was killed alongside her sister Miss Honduras . The bodies were recovered after being found buried near a river bank close the spa where they disappeared . Yesterday Alvarado's body, wrapped in brown plastic, was loaded into the back of a pickup truck just hours before she was to have boarded a flight to London to compete in the Miss World pageant. The sisters, who both grew up in the area, were shot to death and appeared to have been killed the night they disappeared, police said. Officers said an accomplice, Aris Maldonado, was also being held. The two said they buried the bodies near the river so they would decompose quickly, according to Sabillon. He said Ruiz allegedly shot his girlfriend, Sofia, because she was dancing with another man. After a fierce argument, he pulled out a pistol and fired at Sofia first, then Miss Honduras as she tried to flee. Ruiz (second from left) has since confessed to the killings, police say.

Sabillon said authorities were awaiting confirmation from forensic officials that the bodies were of Miss Alvarado and her sister. The BBC reported Leandro Osorio, the head of the country's Bereau of Criminal Investigation, as saying the two women's bodies had been found in Cablotales Village, near the Aguagua River. He said: 'We are 100 per cent sure that it's them'. The reigning Honduras beauty queen Maria Jose Alvarado (pictured left and right) and her sister went missing just days before she was scheduled to fly to London for the Miss World competition . The two young women disappeared on Thursday outside Honduras' northern city of Santa Barbara after a birthday party at a local resort, only days before Alvarado was set fly to London to compete in the Miss World competition. During Plutarco's arrest, police also seized a pistol and two vehicles in the hope they will provide some clues towards what happened. The case has caused consternation in the notoriously violent central American country, home to the most dangerous city on the planet. The Center for Women's Rights, based in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, issued a statement condemning the sisters' killing and highlighted that 328 women have been murdered in this Central American nation so far this year. The group said: 'The case of Mary Jose and Sofia show clearly the situation of generalized violence against women and the nonexistent response of the Honduran government to prevent, investigate or punish it.'

Missing beauty: Miss Alvarado was due to fly to London  to compete in the Miss World competition, scheduled for tomorrow . San Pedro Sula, just over 30 miles from Santa Barbara where the girls were murdered, is the murder capital of the world with more than 1,200 killings a year among its nearly one million inhabitants. On the night they disappeared, Sofia arrived at a party on Thursday in a champagne-colored private car with unidentified men to pick up her sister at 6pm. Police say the women were last seen leaving the party in the champagne-colored car. The Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, tops the list of the world's most violent places on earth. At least three murders are reported each day in the coffee-exporting nation, mostly at the hands of vicious gangs and drug cartels who operate freely in an area of lawlessness, poverty and a decaying justice system. Gunmen have taken control of slums and villages, well aware that the police are ineffective and corrupt. San Pedro Sula recorded 1,218 homicides in 2012 (a rate of 3.3 murders a day). It was followed by Acapulco, Mexico; Caracas, Venezuela and Distrito Central, Honduras. The same year, it was reported that San Pedro Sula is saddled with one of South America's weakest economies - and nearly 70 per cent of the population live in poverty. San Pedro Sula's murder rate of 169 per 100,000 people far surpasses anything in north America or much larger cities like Lagos or Sao Paulo. Maria Jose described herself on a Miss World website profile as an aspiring diplomat who enjoys playing volleyball and football in her spare time. She beat 18 contestants to win the Miss Honduras crown in April. She missed an appointment on Sunday evening to try on the dress she hopes to win Miss World with. Earlier this week, the women's mother Teresa de Jesus pleaded: 'Open your hearts and understand my pain. 'There is an all-powerful God that sees everything and I hope you set them free.' Miss World is due to kick off tomorrow, with 120 contestants competing for the crown. The grand finale takes place on December 14 at ExCel London in the heart of the capital's Royal Docks area.

"Barbara Gordon-Jones, 56, has successfully overturned government restrictions on receiving books from friends and family in prison . A convicted arsonist with a doctorate in English literature has successfully challenged government restrictions on receiving books in jail. A judge declared the rules introduced by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling in November last year as 'unlawful'. Mr Justice Collins' decision was a victory for Barbara Gordon-Jones, 56, a convicted arsonist with a borderline personality disorder who has a degree and a doctorate in English literature. Gordon-Jones, of Tudeley, near Tunbrige Wells, Kent, who also suffers from depression and epilepsy, is serving an indefinite sentence for torching homes and cars and slashing tyres. Her victims were often elderly and vulnerable. She is being held at Send prison near Woking, Surrey. She was denied legal aid but was able to bring her court challenge because lawyers represented her for free. Under the current rules prisoners are prevented from receiving parcels unless they have 'exceptional circumstances', such as a medical condition. But Gordon-Jones challenged the section of the new Prison Service Instruction (PSI) which she said 'imposes substantial restrictions on the ability of prisoners to receive, or have for their use, books'. The judge said the PSI amended the Incentives and Earned Privileges Scheme (IEP), which was brought in partly as an attempt to crack down on drugs getting into prisons. He said: 'I am satisfied that insofar as it includes books in IEP schemes, the PSI is unlawful.' A protest against the ruling, led by the Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy (centre) was held outside Pentonville Prison in north London in March - a court ruling has now successfully challenged the restrictions . A judge declared the rules introduced by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling in November last year as 'unlawful' The ruling was welcomed by solicitors firm Lound Mulrenan Jefferies, who acted for Gordon-Jones along with barristers Jenni Richards QC, Victoria Butler-Cole and Annabel Lee. The solicitors said in a statement: 'Reading is a right and not a privilege, to be encouraged and not restricted. 'Indeed, Mr Justice Collins commented that, as far as books are concerned, ""to refer to them as a privilege is strange"". 'The policy was unnecessary, irrational and counter-productive to rehabilitation. It is now rightly judged unlawful.' The solicitors said the Justice Secretary and prison governor 'sought to argue that there remained adequate access to books because prisoners borrow them from the prison library or purchase them with their own money, but this was rejected in today's judgment'. They said: 'Prison libraries are often inadequately stocked and there are restrictions on access. 'Spending caps for prisoners usually mean that there is enough for bare essentials but not for books.' Referring to the fact that Gordon-Jones was refused legal aid, the solicitors warned: 'Under current proposals to restrict judicial review, it would be more difficult to bring this case and hold the Government to account.' Mr Justice Collins told the High Court (pictured): 'I see no good reason in the light of the importance of books for prisoners to restrict beyond what is required by volumetric control and reasonable measures relating to frequency of parcels and security considerations' The rules have been opposed by arts' figures including Poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy, actress Vanessa Redgrave and author Kathy Lette. A protest was held outside Pentonville Prison in north London in March. Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'The ban on sending books to prisoners was always an absurd policy. 'It had nothing to do with punishing and reforming prisoners but was an example of David Cameron's Government's sloppy policy-making. 'This is a victory for all those who campaigned against the ban and the Government should abandon the ludicrous policy with immediate effect.' Denis MacShane, the former Labour MP jailed for six months for expenses fraud, described today's judgment as 'a modest win for common sense'. He said he had a suitcase full of books confiscated when he was sent to Belmarsh Prison last Christmas. 'Chris Grayling seems to think that being unpleasant to prisoners is good for society. On the contrary it makes rehabilitation much more difficult,' he said. Reacting to the decision, a Prison Service spokesman said: 'This is a surprising judgment. 'There never was a specific ban on books and the restrictions on parcels have been in existence across most of the prison estate for many years and for very good reason. 'Prisoners have access to the same public library service as the rest of us, and can buy books through the prison shop. 'We are considering how best to fulfil the ruling of the court. However, we are clear that we will not do anything that would create a new conduit for smuggling drugs and extremist materials in to our prisons.'","Barbara Gordon-Jones overturned restrictions on receiving books in jail .

"Though required by the police department in Ferguson, Missouri, a use-of-force report documenting the shooting that killed teenager Michael Brown 'doesn't exist,' it has emerged. Megan Asikainen, Ferguson's City Clerk, has claimed there is no use-of-report, Yahoo News reported, saying she 'said multiple times that the document doesn’t exist.' Asikainen expressed similar sentiments to MailOnline, following a public records request under Missouri's Sunshine Law. Where is it? A Ferguson city clerk has claimed there is no use-of-force report for the incident in which Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, pictured . The Ferguson police department states in its 2010 General Orders rulebook that use-of-force reports must be filed, the news site noted. 'Use of Force Report is required for all use of force incidents, to include the pointing of weapons or using weaponless, hand-to-hand control techniques even though they have little or no chance of producing injuries when gaining control over, or subduing non-compliant or resisting persons,' the rulebook says, a copy of which was obtained by the website. The rulebook also states that if a police officer shoots and injures someone, 'The watch commander will complete the Use of Force Report F-080 and forward it through the chain of command to the chief,' Yahoo News pointed out. Police Chief Tom Jackson did not immediately return a request for comment from MailOnline. This week, Jackson appeared in a taped video, in which he regretted the time Michael Brown's body was kept outside, saying 'it was just too long.' Officer: Darren Wilson of the Ferguson police department is seen in this file photo. The department explicitly states in its 2010 General Orders rulebook that use-of-force reports must be filed . The Ferguson police department violated a state law when it failed to include the 'name of the victim and immediate facts' in a police report on the Michael Brown shooting, Yahoo News reported. Brown was shot by police officer Darren Wilson last month - and there is no use-of-force report for a February 2013 incident Wilson was involved with, according to the news site. Asikainen told MailOnline there is no use-of-force report for the February incident. 'I don't think there can be any explanation for the absence of a report other than it is still being reviewed by the chain of command,' criminal justice professor Matthew Hickman told Yahoo News. Citing the St. Louis County Police Department, Hickman said 'With an outside agency doing the [criminal] investigation, Ferguson may just be in a holding pattern.' A request for comment to the Ferguson city council was not immediately answered, either.","Though required by the police department in Ferguson, Missouri, a use-of-force report for the shooting that killed teenager Michael Brown 'doesn't exist,' it has emerged .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin has been awarded an eighth-degree black belt in Kyokushin Karate . Russian President Vladimir Putin has been awarded an eighth-degree black belt in karate - just as a former Soviet leader accused him of having a God complex. The Kremlin leader has now received an eighth dan in the kyokushin-kan form of karate from the Russian federation of the sport, Kyokushin-kan International Honbu. This comes just as Mikhail Gorbachev blasted Putin for getting big headed and seeing himself as God's deputy, complaining that the Russian President now never consults him. The 83-year-old father of glasnost declared: 'He has started picking up the same illness which I suffered from earlier - self-confidence. 'He thinks he is second only to God, but I don't know in charge of what really.' He warned Putin: 'Don't get a big head. That is what ruined me.' Putin is expected to receive his award at a ceremony in December during the world championship of the sport. Kyokushin is a style of stand-up, full contact karate in which the participants wear no protective gear. The former KGB officer is already is a grandmaster in taekwondo, earning his ninth dan in that martial art in 2013. He is also a judo enthusiast, picking up the practice at age 11, according to his official biography on the Kremlin website. 'Judo teaches self-control, the ability to feel the moment, to see the opponent's strengths and weaknesses, to strive for the best results,' he said. 'I am sure you will agree that these are essential abilities and skills for any politician.' Gorbachev's outburst emerged after Angela Merkel spent a furious four hours locked in private talks with the Russian president as they tried to thrash out a solution to the Ukraine conflict. After the main G20 dinner the two leaders met in a small conference room at the Hilton Hotel in Brisbane, where they closed the door to all advisers. She emerged from the discussions at the Hilton Hotel in Brisbane apparently rattled by the talks, in what appears to be a sign of worsening relations between Germany and Russia. But a ceremony with Polish prime minister Ewa Kopacz in the southern Polish town of Krzyżowa, Merkel insisted that she wanted to keep dialogue open between the two countries. 'We are aware that Europe's security can only be ensured, in the medium and long term, with Russia,' she said. 'The sanctions are not a goal in themselves. They are applied only when necessary,' Merkel added, referring to western sanctions placed on Russia. Putin is expected to receive his award at a ceremony in December during the world championship of the sport . Mikhail Gorbachev (right) made the  comments  as he launched his book After the Kremlin, which actually praises Putin (left) Gorbachev made comments about the Russian president as he launched his new book 'After the Kremlin', which praises Putin. He said the former KGB spy had played a major role in stabilising Russia, and that despite applying 'authoritarian methods', Putin worked 'in the interest of the majority'. But the former Soviet president said apart from a chance meeting in June 'we met on the go, shook hands and spoke briefly', Putin's aides tell him categorically that he is too busy to meet. Gorbachev is popular in the West, but less so in Russia, where he blamed for the collapse of the Soviet superpower. But he vowed he would not be gagged by Putin or any of his foes. 'I need to participate, and I will. Nobody will shut my mouth, even though people wanted me to emigrate. I don't want to leave, let those people leave,' he said. 'I am called a traitor because I destroyed so many nuclear arms. The second treachery is that we built good relations with the US.'

Angela Merkel (left) spent a furious four hours locked in private talks with the Russian president as they tried to thrash out a solution to the Ukraine conflict . Gorbachev recently warned of a new Cold War between east and west, 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. 'What is happening now in Ukraine is in many ways due to the mistakes of the breakup of the Soviet Union,' he said. He insisted that Putin was right to restore Crimea to Russia after a referendum, which the West branded as illegitimate. 'Crimea was Russian, and most people in Crimea voted in favour of joining Russia,' he said. 'I supported this move from the beginning, and I am half-Ukrainian.' But he said: 'I worry about what is happening in Ukraine. 'It might not be a scientific fact, but we are the same people.'","Vladimir Putin has received a high-ranking black belt in Kyokushin Karate .

"The government is getting near-daily reports - and sometimes two or three a day - of drones flying near airplanes and helicopters or close to airports without permission, federal and industry officials tell The Associated Press. It's a sharp increase from just two years ago when such reports were still unusual. Many of the reports are filed with the Federal Aviation Administration by airline pilots. But other pilots, airport officials and local authorities often file reports as well, said the officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only on the condition that they not be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. Growing trend: Brian Wilson launches a small drone equipped with a video camera to fly over the scene of an explosion that leveled two apartment buildings in the East Harlem neighborhood of New York . Michael Toscano, president of a drone industry trade group, said FAA officials also have verified the increase to him. While many of the reports are unconfirmed, raising the possibility that pilots may have mistaken a bird or another plane in the distance for a drone, the officials said other reports appear to be credible. The FAA tightly restricts the use of drones, which could cause a crash if one collided with a plane or was sucked into an engine. Small drones usually aren't visible on radar to air traffic controllers, particularly if they're made of plastic or other composites. 'It should not be a matter of luck that keeps an airplane and a drone apart,' said Rory Kay, a training captain at a major airline and a former Air Line Pilots Association safety committee chairman. In the way: The government is receiving reports nearly every day - and sometimes two or three times a day - of drones flying near airplanes and helicopters or close to airports without permission . Bird's-eye view: A remote controlled model aircraft flies over the Washington Nationals spring training baseball workout in Viera, Florida . 'So far we've been lucky because if these things are operating in the sky unregulated, unmonitored and uncontrolled, the possibility of a close proximity event or even a collision has to be of huge concern.' The FAA requires that all drone operators receive permission from the agency, called a certificate of authorization, before they can fly their unmanned aircraft. Most certificates limit drones to 400 feet in altitude and require that they remain within sight of the operator and at least five miles away from an airport. Exceptions are made for some government drones. The military flies drones in great swaths of airspace in remote areas designated for military use. Customs and Border Protection flies high-altitude drones along the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada. Jim Williams, who heads the FAA drone office, caused a stir earlier this year when he told a drone industry conference that an airliner nearly collided with a drone over Tallahassee, Florida, in March. The pilot of the 50-seat Canadair Regional Jet reported the camouflage-painted drone was at an altitude of about 2,300 feet, five miles northeast of the airport. The FAA hasn't been able to find the drone or identify its operator. In some cases the FAA has 'identified unsafe and unauthorized (drone) operations and contacted the individual operators to educate them about how they can operate safely under current regulations and laws,' the agency said in a statement late Tuesday. The FAA also said rogue operators have been threatened with fines. Aviation safety expert John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member, said he's skeptical of some of the reports because most of the small drones currently being sold can't reach the altitudes cited by pilots. Still, 'it needs to be run to ground. That means a real investigation, real work done to determine just what these reports mean,' he said. More than one million small drones have been sold worldwide in the past few years, said Toscano, the official with the drone industry group. It is inevitable that some will misuse them because they don't understand the safety risks or simply don't care, he said. 'This technology has a phenomenal upside that people are still just trying to understand,' he said. 'As unfortunate as it would be that we have an incident, it's not going to shut down the industry.' The FAA is expected to propose regulations before the end of the year that would allow broader commercial use of drones weighing less than 55 pounds. The FAA prohibits nearly all commercial use of drones, although that ban is being challenged. So far, the only commercial permits the agency has granted have been to two oil companies operating in Alaska and seven aerial photography companies associated with movie and television production. But the ban has been ignored by many other drone operators, from real estate agents to urban planners to farmers who use them to monitor crops.","The government is getting near-daily reports of drones flying near airplanes and helicopters or close to airports without permission .

"A pregnant woman who lost her left eye after  police shot at her car during violent protests in Ferguson, Missouri, has spoken of how thankful she is to still be alive. Dornella Conner, 24, was reportedly being driven away by her boyfriend from a gas station in the St Louis suburb when an officer fired a 'bean bag' round at their vehicle, showering her with glass. The mother-of-two, who is around 12 weeks' pregnant, was rushed to hospital with severe injuries to her left eye. Despite medics' best efforts, she was left blinded, with blurry vision in her right eye. But speaking at her home in O'Fallon, St Louis, on Monday, she said she is simply thankful to have survived the shooting, saying: 'I am thankful I am here to see the world and you and my kids.' She also revealed she has already forgiven officers for taking away her sight. 'I forgive the person that shot me because god will bless me for not having hate in my heart,' she said.

Blinded: Dornella Conner (seen in hospital) was reportedly being driven away by her boyfriend, De'Angelas Lee, from a gas station in Ferguson, St Louis, when an officer fired a 'bean bag' round at their vehicle . Before the shooting: The mother-of-two, who is around 12 weeks' pregnant, was taken to hospital with severe injuries to her left eye. Despite medics' best efforts, she was left blinded, with blurry vision in her right eye . Thankful: But speaking at her home in O'Fallon, St Louis, on Monday, she said she is simply thankful to have survived the shooting. Above, Miss Conner is pictured hugging one of her two young daughters in hospital . Miss Conner, who has two young daughters, said she was not participating in the protests against the grand jury's verdict not to indict officer Darren Wilson in the Michael Brown case when she was shot. Instead, she and her boyfriend, De'Angelas Lee, had stopped at the BP gas station in New Halls Ferry Road to fill up their car and purchase 'some snacks', she said. However, a St Louis County Police Department spokesman said Lee deliberately drove directly at officers in the station's parking lot, forcing them to have to jump out of the car's path. Lee, who reportedly came to a halt as police opened fire, has been arrested on second-degree assault charges following the incident last Tuesday, according to KHOU.com. Describing the moment she was struck by shards of glass, Miss Conner, who was sitting in the passenger side of the car said: 'All I felt was a blast in my face.' The victim, who is unable to receive a cornea transplant because her injuries are so severe, added: ''I am hurt because I will never see my left eye again. I have been getting nightmares about it.

Grateful to well-wishers: Earlier this week, Miss Conner, who is now recovering at home, took to Facebook to express her her gratitude to well-wishers and her devastation at her boyfriend's arrest (pictured) A non-lethal bean-bag round . A bean-bag round, or flexible baton round, is a projectile used by law enforcement officers to incapacitate suspects without killing them. They are fired from a shotgun and take the form of lead shots housed in a small 'pillow'. They are designed not to penetrate skin, but are capable of causing muscle spasms. Deaths from bean bag rounds are rare. They have killed people in the past by causing internal bleeding, breaking the neck and even fatally damaging the heart by sending pieces of broken rib into it. Shotguns with bean-bag rounds are normally colored bright orange to prevent lethal rounds being loaded. 'I am just trying to stay strong. I'm just thankful that I am alive because of my kids. I am just thankful because I thought I was dead that night.' Earlier this week, Miss Conner, who is now recovering at home, took to Facebook to express her her gratitude to well-wishers and her devastation at her boyfriend's arrest. Under the pseudonym 'Lenora Prince', she wrote: 'I'm hurt because I can't see again and my love of my life is not here, but I forgive those who have done wrong things to me.' In another post, she told her friends: 'Remember god is in control, not you and me... if you have children kiss them, tell you them you love them, because life is never promised.' Miss Conner has also set up a Facebook page, Dornnella Is Alive, on which she has written the short description: 'I am thankful to be alive'. Police arrived at the gas station last Tuesday following following reports of looting and rioting. During the night's protests over unarmed 18-year-old Brown's fatal shooting on August 9 in Ferguson, 16 people were arrested, officers said. Last Thursday, Miss Conner told KMOV.com that several police vehicles had blocked their exit from the gas station ‘from the side and the back’ in the minutes before she was shot. The victim's father, Donnell, said he was 'very disappointed at police tactic'’, adding: ‘There was no reason to fire upon an innocent person who was sitting in a vehicle.’ Meanwhile, Miss Cornell's sister, Tikal Goldie, said: ‘I really just want to have closure and justice for my sister.’ It comes as tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets of more than 170 cities across America to protest against the jury's decision not to indict Wilson, who is white.

On Sunday, furious St Louis cops demanded that NFL players who made the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture in solidarity with Ferguson protesters are punished by their superiors. Officials from the St Louis County Police Association - the police union for the area including Ferguson - said that it was 'profoundly disappointed' in the five players who made the gesture. Officers released an angry statement, saying the players 'ignored mountains of evidence' vindicating Wilson over the shooting of Brown. The statement, given to KSDK, also described the gesture, which protesters have adopted across the nation, as: 'tasteless, offensive and inflammatory'. Support: It comes as tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets of more than 170 cities across America to protest against the jury's decision not to indict officer Darren Wilson in Michael Brown's shooting.

"Two British ex-soldiers who travelled to Syria to fight the Islamic State have told how they want revenge for the execution of aid worker Alan Henning. James Hughes, 26, and Jamie Read, 24, are helping Kurdish Peshmerga defend the embattled city of Kobane from the terror group. Speaking from the front line, Mr Read, from Cumbria, said he believed ISIS was 'the biggest threat the world faces' and felt compelled to act even though his family had concerns. 'Killing the aid worker was the final straw,' he said. Taxi driver Mr Henning, 47, was killed by a masked militant known as Jihadi John in a video released online in October following a string of similarly publicised killings. Scroll down for video . British ex-soldiers Jamie Read (left) and James Hughes (right) have told how they travelled to Syria to fight the Islamic State to avenge the beheading death of UK aid worker Alan Henning . 'There is no justification for their executions - for putting innocent guys on their knees and doing that, Mr Read told The Sun. He added: 'My family were nervous and obviously worried about my well-being - we have gone into an unknown world. 'But I'm a firm believer that if you want to do something you have to do it and not just talk about it.' Mr Hughes, from Worcestershire, said: 'I wanted to help. The situation in England is getting bad in terms of the support ISIS get. 'The world needs to open its eyes to the threat they pose.' Mr Read had a brief stint in the Second Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's regiment, while Mr Hughes served three tours of Afghanistan, the paper said. Brave: James Hughes (left) and Jamie Read (right) with other foreign volunteers who have joined a Kurdish anti-ISIS group called The Lions Of Rojava . Brothers in arms: Jamie Read, right, with American Jordan Matson, who is also fighting in Syria . The pair hit the headlines last month when it was revealed they had travelled to the war-torn country to join a band of foreign fighters known as the Lions of Rojava. They were accused of acting as mercenaries, but they insist they are not being paid and are simply involved in a war of 'good against evil'. Photographs posted on Facebook show the pair on the Syrian front line dressed in combat fatigues and armed with assault rifles, posing in bullet-scarred buildings. On the website of the security firm they founded, Mr Hughes and Mr Read said they were motivated by 'conscience', not money, to travel to the warzone 'to assist innocent people in the face of terror from ISIS'. Insisting they were volunteer fighters, not guns for hire, the ex-servicemen said they would 'not do nothing while innocent men, women and children are tortured and murdered by Islamic State while the international community stands by and observes from the luxury of their boardrooms or their tanks on the hill'. They add: 'This is not a religious war nor is it a racial war, this is a war of good against evil – a magnificent simplicity.' But Mr Read's mother said she was not happy that her son had travelled to Syrian Kurdistan – known as Rojava – to fight the Islamist extremists. Speaking from her family home in Carlisle, Wendy Armiger, 43, said: 'He's been in touch to say he's okay, but I don't like the fact that he's gone there. It's his life, but he's my son.' Mr Hughes, from Malvern, Worcestershire, said he had served in the infantry for five years, including three tours of Afghanistan, before leaving earlier this year. Mr Read, who lives in Newmains, North Lanarkshire, said in an online CV that he had been in the Army for three years, specialising in reconnaissance, before leaving in 2010 to work for private security companies. In August, the friends set up the Pathfinder Group Terrorism & Conflict Research Center, a security company with the intention of providing 'specialist intelligence and surveillance services', and building up detailed information about terror groups. The firm's motto is: 'We will go where the rest fear to go'. On Facebook, Mr Read describes how he had been involved in a fierce clash with ISIS jihadists. British taxi driver Alan Henning was kidnapped last Boxing Day while delviering aid for a local charity . He wrote that the 's*** hit the fan', prompting Jordan Matson, 28, a US veteran wounded fighting with the Kurds who is understood to have recruited the Britons, to reply: 'It's always interesting the first time you have a bullet fly past your head.' Graham Penrose, a security consultant who is liaising between the ex-soldiers and their families, said: 'They are not being paid. They are not participating for any commercial gain.' On the other side of the battle lines, official figures suggest more than 500 Britons have travelled to fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq. ISIS has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, US aid worker Peter Kassig and British aid workers David Haines and Mr Henning. Footage appearing to show Mr Henning's murder appeared on the internet just days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq. Security services have also been attempting to uncover the identity of Jihadi John, who appears to speak with a British accent. The Home Office has warned against travelling to Syria and said anyone who did so was putting themselves in 'considerable danger'. A spokeswoman said at the time: 'The best way to help the people of these countries is to donate to registered charities that have ongoing relief operations, not by taking part in a conflict overseas, which can be an offence under both criminal and terror laws. 'People who commit, plan and support acts of terror abroad and seek to return to the UK will be prosecuted by the UK authorities. Whether a prosecution for an offence is justified in an individual case is a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service to decide after a full police investigation.' Last month the Government announced a number of new anti-terror measures designed to combat the risk of IS radicals returning to Britain, including blocking suspected fighters entry to the UK. They call themselves the Lions Of Rojava and boast: 'It is better to live one day as a Lion that a thousand days as a sheep.' They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria to fight, not for jihad, but on behalf of the Kurdish communities who are defending their communities from the advance of Sunni Islamists. Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for the radical Islamists of Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds. A photo shared on the Lions of Rojava Facebook page this week showed Joshua Matson (bottom left), Jamie Read (top, second from left), Joshua Bell (bottom right) and Jamie Hughes posing alongside an unidentified man (top, second from right), Briton (top left) and American (top centre) Jordan Matson, a former U.S. soldier now with Syrian Kurds' People's Protection Units (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight. Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora. In August a hairdresser from South London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance. But since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against Islamic State, perhaps also inspired by the radical socialist experiment underway in the Kurdish autonomous region of Rojava. Inspired by the social ecologist and anarchist Murray Bookchin it has adopted a vision of 'libertarian municipalism' calling for Kurds to create free, self-governing communities. Last month it was reported that a currently serving British marine had been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias during his leave. The 22-year-old Royal Marine Commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey. He was suspected of being in contact with Kurdish militant groups. Two women, Canadian Jew Gill Rosenberg, 31, and Danish Kurd Joanna Palani, 20, have also reportedly travelled to fight with the Kurds, inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against Islamic State terrorists. It is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict. There are also claims that a number of European biker gangs have travelled to Syria and are helping to assist the resistance. Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their German riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons. The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobani to join the fight against ISIS.","James Hughes and Jamie Read are helping Kurds defend city of Kobane .

"Sweeping new anti-terror laws were published by the Government today - less than 24 hours after a damning Parliamentary report into the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby by Islamist fanatics. A new Counter-terrorism and Security Bill, containing a range of draconian powers including orders to block suspected British jihadists  from returning to the UK, was introduced to Parliament. It comes after an official report into the May 2013 murder of Fusilier Rigby revealed a series of missed opportunities by the security services to prevent the attack. Scroll down for video . The increasing threat against Britain has seen the Government introduce sweeping new anti-terror powers . The new counter-terror legislation will ban insurance companies from footing the bill for terrorist ransoms and powers will be re-introduced to relocate terror suspects across the country. A statutory duty will be placed on named organisations - such as colleges, universities, the police and probation providers - to help deter radicalisation and, where organisations fail, ministers will be able to issue court-enforced directions to them. Police are to be handed powers in the new bill to force internet firms to hand over details that could help identify suspected terrorists and paedophiles, while police and border staff will be given the power to seize the passports of terror suspects. Its second reading in Parliament - the first opportunity for MPs to debate the main principles of the bill - will take place tomorrow. Home Secretary Theresa May the bill included a ‘considered, targeted set of proposals that will help to keep us safe at a time of very significant danger by ensuring we have the powers we need to defend ourselves’. But Amnesty International accused the government of ‘rushing through’ a ‘grab-bag of measures without proper scrutiny or challenge’. Drummer Lee Rigby was almost decapitated in a brutal attack outside Woolwich barracks last year . Michael Adebowale, left, and Michael Adebolajo, right, were jailed for life for the murder of Lee Rigby last year . David Cameron yesterday announced an extra £130million would be handed to the security services to help identify lone wolf terrorists. Mr Cameron vowed to take steps to try to ensure the police, MI5 and MI6 can successfully fight back against plots. The PM also revealed new laws, set to be introduced to Parliament tomorrow, would help move terror suspects away from their extremist associates and strip passports from people trying to travel into war zones. The PM said: ‘We will not shrink from doing what is necessary to keep our people safe.' Yesterday's long-awaited report into Fusilier Rigby's killing revealed that the two killers - Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale - had appeared in seven different investigations by MI5 and MI6 before they launched their attack. Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee criticised the security services for 'delays' in their investigations which at times was 'inadequate.' But it said given what the agencies knew at the time 'they were not in a position to prevent the murder of Fusilier Rigby'. However it slammed giant internet firms for failing to hand over key pieces of information which might have helped security chiefs stop the attacks. It said Adebowale detailed a threat to kill a soldier, posted on his Facebook account in December 2012, was 'highly significant'. In the most explosive section of the report, it states: 'Had MI5 had access to this exchange at the time, Adebowale would have become a top priority. There is then a significant possibility that MI5 would have been able to prevent the attack.' The main findings of the report also included: . David Cameron told MPs he would not introduce emergency laws in response to today's report but said there were lessons to be learnt . US social media giant Facebook allegedly failed to close down Michael Adebowale's personal account - even after he used it to post explicit threats to kill a soldier. Today's report said: 'They left the one that said…“Let’s kill a soldier”. That didn’t meet their criteria [for closure].' While MPs and peers refused to name the company in question, it was later reported to be Facebook. The report criticised internet companies for their refusal to cooperate with security services to help stop terror attacks. It said it was 'clear' that social media companies could have 'made a difference' if they alerted British authorities to online messages in which Adebowale threatened to kill a soldier. The report says the company which hosted the terror exchange 'does not regard themselves as under any obligation to ensure that they identify such threats, or to report them to the authorities'. It added: 'We find this unacceptable: however unintentionally, they are providing a safe haven for terrorists. None of the major US companies the committee approached proactively monitor and review suspicious content on their systems, largely relying on users to notify them of offensive or suspicious content. None of them regard themselves as compelled to comply with UK warrants obtained under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. That means that even if MI5 had a warrant for the information before the attack, the company might not have responded. Adebolajo and Adebowale ran down Fusilier Rigby, who was dressed in a Help for Heroes hoodie, in a Vauxhall Tigra near Woolwich Barracks, in south-east London, before savagely attacking the defenceless soldier as he lay in the road. As armed police arrived, the two men charged the vehicle, with Adebowale brandishing a rusted, unloaded revolver. They were both shot at the scene. The killers were convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in December last year and were later sentenced to whole life and life with a minimum of 45 years respectively. A terrorist magazine which acts as a guide for fanatics to carry out atrocities in the West is still available online – despite being the inspiration for Lee Rigby’s murder. ‘Inspire’, a quarterly journal for extremists, is a ‘pernicious’ threat which ‘exhorts violent action and gives recipes on how to do so’, the committee said. The report states: 'MI5 has told the Committee of the link between Inspire and individuals involved in planning UK attacks: . ‘We can now say that Inspire has been read by those involved in at least seven out of the ten attacks planned within the UK since its first issue [in 2010]. Labour MP Hazel Blears has demanded a crack down on extremist material . ‘We judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these ten attack plots.’ Despite the influence of the Al Qaeda magazine MailOnline was able to download the latest edition – Spring 2014 – within minutes of today’s publication. In the online journal, it tells extremists that ‘America is our first target, followed by the United Kingdom, France and other crusader countries.’ It directs terrorists to bomb Premier League games, tennis tournaments – and even the Savoy hotel. It tells jihadists: 'You have the soccer (football) stadiums especially during Premier League and FA Cup matches. They have worldwide live media coverage. 'In the beginning of summer, we have Cheltenham, and the end of summer we have Epsom, hereby horse races are attended by thousands from around the kingdom including the Queen. 'There are also Tennis tournaments.' Today’s report said it should be ‘sufficient grounds’ for the security services to launch surveillance on anyone caught reading the magazine. It stated: 'Engagement with extremist media should be taken extremely seriously. For example, Inspire magazine provides advice and guidance to individuals on how to commit terrorist attacks in the UK. ‘In most cases, engaging with extremist media such as Inspire should be sufficient grounds to justify intrusive action.'","Fusilier Rigby killed by  Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale last year .

"Amid the violence, destruction, protests, and nationwide division since a grand jury's failure to indict a white police officer who killed an unarmed black teen on Nov. 25, hope in humanity has been restored, through, what is being called, the hug shared 'round the world. During an emotional rally in Portland, Oregon, freelance photographer Johnny Nguyen snapped a photo of a 12-year-old black boy Devonte Hart as he hugged white police officer, Portland Police Sgt. Bret Barnum with tears in his eyes, according to the Oregonian. 'I came upon this boy who had tears in his eyes and I knew this was the place to be,' Nguyen told the Oregonian, 'so I followed him in the crowd. 'Then he came upon the police officer. They talked and he gave him a hug.' Scroll down for video . Emotional: During an emotional rally in Portland, Oregon, a 12-year-old black boy, Devonte Hart, with tears in his eyes, embraced a white police officer, Portland Police Sgt. Bret Barnum . Do I?: Hart was holding a sign at the rally that read 'free hugs,' Barnum saw the boy and motioned him over. Barnum motioned toward the boy's sign and asked 'Do I get one of those?' Hart was holding a sign at the rally that read 'free hugs,' Barnum saw the boy and motioned him over as speakers addressed the crowd. Barnum told the Oregonian that the two began talking about the demonstration, school, life and art. Afterward, Barnum motioned toward the boy's sign and asked 'Do I get one of those?' It was then that the 12-year-old embraced the 21-year police veteran, ABC news reports. After the emotional exchange, the two went their separate ways. Hart went back to his friends and family participating in the rally, and Barnum returned to his duties. Barnum has two teenage sons and has worked for Portland's police force for 21 years. While continuing to talk to Devonte, he looked at the 'Free Hugs' sign on the ground and asked if he might get a hug as well. Devonte put his arms around the officer. 'Knowing how he struggled with police, his bravery and courage to catch my eye and approach me were impressive,' Barnum said. 'And it's a blessing for me that I didn't miss an opportunity to impact this child.' Kindnedd: Devonte's parents were often surprised by his genuine acts of kindness including when he asked to spend his eleventh and twelfth birthdays raising money for charity . ABC reports that seven people were arrested at the rally where several highways were closed down due to protesters entering the roadways. What may have seemed to be a small, seemingly private exchange between the two quickly became known to the nation. Since it's capture, the photo has been shared or viewed more than 100,000 on Facebook, it has been tweeted and favorited more than 4,000 times on Twitter and has received more that 900 'Likes' on Nguyen's Instagram account. Protests: Since a grand jury's failure to indict Darren Wilson, the white police officer who killed an unarmed black teen, the nation has erupted in protest . Hart has an emotional story of his own. The 12-year-old was born to a drug addicted mother and by the age of four had smoked, consumed alcohol, handled firearms, and suffered severe neglect and abuse, according to Paper Trail. Devonte is one of six children adopted by Hart and her wife, Sarah Hart of West Linn, a suburb of Portland. The boy's adoptive mother Jennifer Hart, who is white, wrote on social media that her son had been struggling with issues of police brutality and racism. 'Devonte was struggling. He wouldn't speak. He was inconsolable,' his mother wrote. 'My son has a heart of gold, compassion beyond anything I've ever experienced, yet struggles with living fearlessly when it comes to the police... He wonders if someday when he no longer wears a 'Free Hugs' sign around his neck, when he's a full-grown black male, if his life will be in danger for simply being.' Paper Trail reports that Devonte's parents were often surprised by his genuine acts of kindness including when he asked to spend his eleventh and twelfth birthdays raising money for charity and the time he hugged musician Xavier Rudd while at a festival. Hart said the moment was about 'listening to each other, facing fears with an open heart.' Earlier that week, when an officer posted on Facebook a badge of the Portland Police Bureau with an 'I am Darren Wilson' banner, Barnum had 'liked' the post. The officers were later ordered to remove the images and the matter is under an internal investigation. Barnum said he 'liked' the image out of solidarity for the police profession, not because he supports Wilson.","During an emotional rally in Portland, Oregon, freelance photographer Johnny Nguyen snapped a photo of a 12-year-old black boy Devonte Hart as he hugged a white police officer Portland Police Sgt.

"This footage shows the incredible moment a thief appears to hypnotise a shopkeeper before rifling through his pockets while he is in a trance. The man, who is believed to be Eastern European, walked into the shop in Highgate, north London, and claimed his wife was pregnant and needed water. He can be seen touching shopkeeper, Aftab Haider, on the stomach to demonstrate his wife's baby bump, before the man falls into what appears to be a trance-like state. This is the moment a brazen thief walked into a shop in Highgate, north London, and speaks to the owner . Mr Haider, 56, who runs Hops'n'Pops off licence, only comes to after the thief has rummaged through his pockets and made off with the contents during the bizarre incident on September 11. The 45 second heist is believed to be the first time the crime, which has been reported in Nigeria, India and Italy, has been filmed in Britain. Mr Haider said: 'I’m so upset about what happened. It’s hard to talk about but I want to help stop this happening to other shopkeepers. 'It was late and I was tired, I’m not sure but it was like I was hypnotised. 'He said his wife was in trouble and needed someone to help her. 'While he was touching me he took all the money from my right hand side, which had my float money, and all the money from my left. 'He was touching my stomach saying ""my wife is pregnant"" - it’s an old trick of the professionals. 'I was thinking, what should I give to him? Maybe he wanted water, tonic water? 'I feel really shocked by it. I thought, ""why is he touching me?"" But by that time it was too late.' The man can be seen talking to the shopkeeper where he claims that his wife is pregnant and needs water . The footage shows the man, who is believed to be Eastern European, touching the shopkeeper's stomach . His wife, Paula, said: 'His friend was outside and couldn’t believe he was allowing him to touch him like that. 'He thought maybe they were friends or maybe he had some sort of hypnotic powers over him. 'I feel like we were targeted I saw a few people hanging around the shop a few days before.' Hypnotherapist, Trevor Hoskisson, told MailOnline: 'If someone is naturally very highly hypnotisable it would be possible to do something like this. 'The thief, in this case, would probably have visited the shop a few days or weeks earlier to assess the level of hypnotisability of the shop keeper and to observe how the takings are handled. 'It's extremely rare in the UK for a crime to be committed using hypnosis but strangely, in Italy, there are about half a dozen crimes committed like this each year. 'As a general principle you cannot get anyone to do anything against their will using hypnosis and far from being a circus act or means to commit crime, it is a highly therapeutic tool.' Jack Raymond, a hypnotherapist based in London, was more sceptical and said: 'Pickpockets distract their victims constantly and this guy has learnt a technique and stuck to it. 'What he is saying will be important as well as the motions. The touching of the stomach meant that he didn't notice when he put his hands in his pockets. He is attempting to demonstrate his wife's condition but it appears that the shopkeeper falls into a trance . He then rummages through the man's pockets, taking what he can, before making off down Archway Road . 'We go into trances all the time - when we're watching television, reading books, when we're half asleep in the morning. It's about turning off the attention centre in the brain.' But Mr Raymond made it clear that the thief is no Derren Brown and added: 'It's similar to someone who learns one thing and can do it well, but the whole point is he was distracting.' Officers investigating the theft described it as an 'elaborate stage act' which they have never seen used anywhere else in the UK. They have now released the CCTV from the off licence on Archway Road in a bid to track down the thief. Detective Sergeant Dave Bullock, Serious Acquisitive Crime Unit in Haringey, said: 'The victim in this incident said that he was momentarily unaware of what had happened to him. 'The suspect's distraction tactics appeared to have worked as he robbed the victim of cash from his pocket. 'If anyone recognises the suspect or has been a victim in similar circumstances, please contact us.' Scotland Yard said: 'On Thursday, September 11 at approximately 9.45pm the suspect entered a shop in Archway Road and told the owner that his wife was pregnant and she needed some bottled water. The shopkeeper only appears to come to once the man has already made his way out of the front door . 'The suspect touched the stomach area of the victim to imitate his wife's condition. 'The suspect is then seen to take a quantity of cash out of the victim's pockets as the victim remained motionless and unable to stop the robbery taking place. 'The suspect is described as approximately 30-35 years old, of Eastern European appearance, around 5ft 8ins tall, of slim build, with short black hair, wearing dark jeans, a grey polo shirt, a black bomber jacket with small white writing on the back just below the collar.' Anyone with information should call police on 020 3276 3158 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","The man walked into shop and claimed he needed water for pregnant wife .

"Scientists in Germany are closer to dating an ancient wooden statue which they say contains secret encrypted codes written around 9,500 years ago - possibly the oldest on the planet. The haunting Shigir Idol is twice as old as the Egyptian pyramids and was preserved 'as if in a time capsule' in a peat bog on the western fringes of Siberia. Now Russian experts say the remarkable relic contains encoded information on the 'creation of the world' - a message to modern man from the Mesolithic era of the Stone Age. Scroll down for video . Scientists in Germany are close to dating an ancient wooden statue which they say contains secret encrypted codes written around 9,500 years ago - possibly the oldest on the planet . 'German scientists are now close to a precise dating - within five decades - of the remarkable artifact, which is a stunning example of ancient man's creativity,' reported The Siberian Times . 'The results are likely to be known in late February or early March.' The idol, 'scraped' using a 'stone spoon' from larch timber, is around 4,000 to 5,000 years older than Britain's world famous Stonehenge monument. It stands 9.2ft (2.8 metres) in height but originally was 17.4ft (5.3 metres) tall, as high as a two storey house. The haunting Shigir Idol is twice as old as the Egypian pyramids and was preserved 'as if in a time capsule' in a peat bog on the western fringes of Siberia . The Shigir Idol is thought to be the most ancient wooden sculpture in the world. The haunting idol is twice as old as the Egypian pyramids and was preserved 'as if in a time capsule' in a peat bog . It was made during the Mesolithic period, around 7,500 BCE but was only discovered in 1890 in Kirovgrad, Sverdlovsk region, in the Ural Mountains. It stands 9.2ft (2.8 metres) in height but originally was 17.4ft (5.3 metres) tall, as high as a two storey house. Almost 6.5ft (2 metres) of the artefact went missing during Russian's 20th century political turmoil, though Siberian archaeologist Vladimir Tolmachev drew images of all the pieces. The messages carved into the ornament 'remain 'an utter mystery to modern man', according to experts. Some say the straight lines could denote land, or horizon - the boundary between earth and sky, water and sky, or the borderline between the worlds. A wavy line or zigzag symbolised the watery element, snake, lizard, or determined a certain border. But the marks could have multiple meanings for the ancient statue-makers who gave the idol seven faces, only one of which is three-dimensional. The faces may be images of spirits that inhabited the human world in ancient times. Almost 6.5ft (2 metres) of the artefact went missing during Russian's 20th century political turmoil, though Siberian archaeologist Vladimir Tolmachev drew images of all the pieces. German pre-historian Professor Thomas Terberger said: 'There is no such ancient sculpture in the whole of Europe. 'Studying this Idol is a dream come true.' Professor Mikhail Zhilin, leading researcher of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Archeology, explained: 'We study the Idol with a feeling of awe. 'This is a masterpiece, carrying gigantic emotional value and force. 'It is a unique sculpture, there is nothing else in the world like this. It is very alive, and very complicated at the same time. 'The ornament is covered with nothing but encrypted information. People were passing on knowledge with the help of the Idol.' While the messages remain 'an utter mystery to modern man', the Russian academic said its creators 'lived in total harmony with the world, had advanced intellectual development, and a complicated spiritual world'. Svetlana Savchenko, chief keeper of Shigir Idol at Yekaterinburg History Museum, concludes that 'a straight line could denote land, or horizon - the boundary between earth and sky, water and sky, or the borderline between the worlds. 'A wavy line or zigzag symbolised the watery element, snake, lizard, or determined a certain border. 'In addition, the zigzag signaled danger, like a pike. Cross, rhombus, square, circle depicted the fire or the sun, and so on.' The Shigir Idol stands 9.2ft (2.8 metres) in height but originally was 17.4ft (5.3 metres) tall, as high as a two storey house. Almost 6.5ft (2 metres) of the artefact went missing during Russian's 20th century political turmoil, though Siberian archaeologist Vladimir Tolmachev drew images of all the pieces .

While the messages remain 'an utter mystery to modern man', the Russian academic said its creators 'lived in total harmony with the world, had advanced intellectual development, and a complicated spiritual world'. Pictured is a building of Urals history museum in 1910 in which the relic is held . But the marks could have multiple meanings for the ancient statue-makers who gave the idol seven faces, only one of which is three-dimensional. 'If these are images of spirits that inhabited the human world in ancient times, the vertical position of figures (one above the other) probably relate to their hierarchy,' said author Petr Zolin. 'Images on the front and back planes of the Idol, possibly indicate that they belong to different worlds. 'If there are depicted myths about the origin of humans and the world, the vertical arrangement of the images may reflect the sequence of events. Ornaments can be special signs which mark something as significant.' Mr Savchenko argues that the idol tells the story of the 'creation of the world' as understood by Mesolithic man. Professor Uwe Hoysner, from Berlin Archaeological Institute added: 'The idol is carved from larch, which, as we see by the annual rings, was at least 159 years old. 'The samples we selected contain important information about the isotopes that correspond to the time when the tree grew.' The peat protected the larch wood. The Idol was found in 1890 in Kirovgrad, Sverdlovsk region, in the Ural Mountains. The marks could have multiple meanings for the ancient statue-makers who gave the idol seven faces, only one of which is three-dimensional .

"United States employers added the largest number of workers in nearly three years in November, with 321,000 additional jobs put on the payroll. The government also revealed that 44,000 more jobs were added in September and October than it had previously estimated, providing further evidence that the US is outperforming other economies in the developed world. Job gains averaged 241,000 a month this year, putting 2014 on track to be the strongest year for hiring since 1999. The unemployment rate remained at a six-year low of 5.8 per cent. November's burst in hiring, reflecting a steadily rising economy, could make it likelier that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates by mid-2015 as many economists have speculated. Scroll down for video . Job seekers fill out job applications at a job fair in Miami Lakes, Florida. Job gains have averaged 241,000 a month this year, putting 2014 on track to be the strongest year for hiring since 1999 . The Fed has kept its key short-term rate at a record low near zero since 2008 to support the economy. The job gains last month coincided with a sharp increase in workers' pay. The average hourly wage rose 9 cents to $24.66, which is the biggest gain in 17 months. But over the past 12 months, hourly pay has risen just 2.1 per cent - barely above the 1.7 per cent inflation rate. Hiring last month was broad-based but was particularly concentrated in retail, temporary services and transportation and warehousing. Those increases likely reflect seasonal hiring for the holiday season. Shipping companies have announced ambitious plans: UPS has said it expects to add up to 95,000 seasonal workers, up from 85,000 last year. FedEx plans to hire 50,000, up from 40,000. In addition, manufacturers added 28,000 jobs, the most in a year, and education and health services 38,000. United States employers added the largest number of workers in nearly three years in November, with 321,000 additional jobs put on the payroll . Professional and business services, a category that includes temps but also higher-paying jobs in fields such as accounting and engineering, added the most jobs in four years. The surge in hiring comes after the economy expanded from April through September at its fastest pace in 11 years. The additional jobs should support steady growth in coming months. The U.S. recovery still has far to go to fully rebound from the Great Recession, given that many people without jobs have stopped looking for one and are no longer counted as unemployed and many others have received little or no pay increases. 'At this rate, we won't return to pre-recession labor market health until October 2016 - nearly nine years since the recession began,' said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration technology students (from left: Micahel Jennings, David Ellerby, Terry Foy and Roger Saunders) use a simulator in the classroom at the Cape Fear Community College downtown campus in Wilmington, N.C. Yet, the improving U.S. job market contrasts with weakness elsewhere around the globe. Growth among the 18 European nations in the euro alliance is barely positive, and the eurozone's unemployment rate is 11.5 per cent. Japan is in recession. China's growth has slowed as it seeks to rein in excessive lending tied to real estate development. Other large developing countries, including Russia and Brazil, are also straining to grow. Most economists say the United States will likely continue to strengthen despite the sluggishness overseas. The US economy is much less dependent on exports than are Germany, China and Japan. US growth is fueled more by its large domestic market and free-spending consumers, who account for about 70 per cent of the economy. That trend helps support the steady US job growth. Most of the industries that have enjoyed the strongest job gains depend on the US market rather than on overseas demand. The US Federal Reserve building. November's burst in hiring could make it likelier that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates by mid-2015 as many economists have speculated . Retailers, restaurants and hotels, and education and health care, for example, have been among the most consistent sources of healthy hiring since the recession officially ended in 2009. Most recent figures on the economy have been encouraging. Americans are buying more cars, which will likely keep factories busy in coming months. Auto sales last month rose to their second-fastest pace this year. Car sales are on track to rise 6 per cent this year from 2013. And a survey by the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, showed that services firms expanded at nearly the fastest pace in eight years last month. Retailers, hotels, construction firms and other service companies added jobs, the survey found, though more slowly than in October. The ISM's separate survey of manufacturing firms showed that factories are expanding at a brisk pace. New orders and order backlogs rose, pointing to steady growth in coming months. There have been some signs of moderating growth. Consumer spending rose only modestly in October. In addition, businesses ordered fewer big-ticket manufactured goods that month, excluding the volatile aircraft category, indicating that companies are holding back on investment.","Statistics suggest US will outperform other economies in developed world .

"North Korea has circulated a draft UN resolution praising its own human rights record and proclaimed it has 'nothing to hide' from the world. In a closed meeting, dozens of diplomats sat in silence after the North handed out copies in a rare effort to counter the international community's condemnation of its oppression. China finally broke the silence, saying it strongly opposes resolutions that interfere in a country's internal affairs, a pointed reference to a separate resolution sharply criticising North Korea's human rights record. The UN Secretariat, New York: In a closed United Nations meeting, dozens of diplomats sat in silence after the North handed out copies of a draft resolution praising its own human rights record . The EU told the North Koreans that Pyongyang's recent contacts with EU officials have been welcome, but that doesn't mean its joint resolution with Japan criticising the North will be withdrawn. No diplomat commented on the draft resolution in the meeting, which broke up after just 20 minutes. The North Koreans said comments are welcome until the end of the month. 'Don't hesitate to contact me,' one said. The draft was not circulated publicly. In a letter to diplomats circulated last week, North Korea said its resolution for the U.N. General Assembly would mention the country's free education and medical systems and the 'recent positive measures' to improve relations with South Korea. North Korea has taken the unusual approach of promoting its rights record in the months since a U.N. commission of inquiry report was harshly critical of the impoverished, reclusive regime. The 372-page report accused the North of running political prison camps with up to 120,000 people and sponsoring abductions of South Koreans, Japanese and others. The EU and Japan are now encouraging the Security Council to follow that report's recommendations and refer North Korea's situation to the International Criminal Court. Their draft resolution for the General Assembly's human rights committee also presses for targeted sanctions.

Brutal: The 372-page report accused the North of running political prison camps with up to 120,000 people and sponsoring abductions of South Koreans, Japanese and others . Tthe North Koreans briefly made their case for their draft yesterday, saying Pyongyang has been reaching out to the international community and that it participates in U.N. human rights work. They also said North Korea, Myanmar and Iran are all examples of countries that are frequent targets of resolutions like the EU-Japan one. The EU told the meeting it had received no recent examples of North Korea engaging with the U.N. side on human rights. The EU-Japan draft resolution is non-binding and also needs approval by the 193-member General Assembly. Even if the more powerful Security Council takes up the recommendation to refer North Korea's situation to the ICC, the effort is expected to fail because China would likely use its veto power as a permanent council member.","DPRK circulates draft resolution praising its own human rights record .

Now you look: An experiment was conducted by Road Safety Analysis to see if drunk people were more likely to use a zebra crossing if the lollipop men were dressed provocatively . It was created by Road Safety Analysis after shocking new figures revealed one in eight pedestrians killed or seriously injured by cars were drunk. While there has been a 48 per cent reduction in the number of child pedestrian injuries in the last ten years, the number of adults being killed or injured is rising. The figures show that almost half of all drunk revellers fail to properly use a zebra crossing at night. Safety first: The experiment came after it was revealed that one in eight pedestrians involved in car accidents were intoxicated . Stop: The organisation are particularly concerned that accidents could rise of the festive period . The organisation are hoping that by 'sexing up' the lollipop men and women they might encourage more people to use a zebra crossing correctly. Richard Owen, operations director for safer roads, said that the growing number in accidents is worrying but it can be particularly concerning around the festive period. 'At this time of year there is always a big focus on drink driving but drunk pedestrians are also a serious concern,' he said.

"Adewale Adewole admitted to using Match.com to con four women out of nearly £100,000 . A lonely hearts conman who scammed four women out of almost £100,000 by posing as a Royal Marine on dating website Match.com has been jailed for four years . Adewale Adewole, 31, a Nigerian immigrant, wooed his victims after falsely claiming to be an army captain who ran an orphanage in Africa. Adopting the name Timmy Francis, he claimed he was looking for romance on the site with two profiles: 'Charismatic Brit' and 'To live and love'. But the pictures he used to create an appealing profile were actually of a Royal Marine Commando called Joshua McGowan who was unaware his images were being used by Adewole. The unnamed women who replied to his seemingly perfect profile fell for his charms but were then duped out of their money when Adewole claimed he was robbed at his 'orphanage'. The women sent him cash and paid his hotel bills thinking they were bailing out their suitor - only for him to divert the money into the bank account of his wife who shared his home with their two children in Eccles, Greater Manchester. Manchester Crown Court heard yesterday that Adewole, a father of three, also splashed out on iPads, TVs and designer clothes. Police who investigated the scam discovered the women had tried to meet up with him but he always stood them up. He now faces jail after admitting four charges of fraud but is disputing some of the facts and is running a 'trial of issue.' Prosecutor Charlotte Brandon told the court the four victims were registered with Match.com and did not know each other. She added: 'They were all contacted on the dating site by a man called Timmy Francis who had two profiles under the mottos 'To Live and Love' and 'Charismatic Brit'. 'They had contact with him during the period the fraud took place via text message, phone and email. 'He told them he had been a captain in the army. He also said he ran an orphanage in Africa called the Hope House Foundation, for which he set up a website with his own mobile phone number on. Manchester Crown Court heard Adewole, from Eccles in Greater Manchester, diverted the money from the unnamed into his wife's account . 'There was a profile picture on his Match accounts and he sent some of the women photographs of himself - all of these pictures were actually of a Royal Marine Commander called Joshua McGowan who knew nothing of what was going on. 'Each of the women wanted to find out more about him and were led to believe they were in a relationship with him. 'Although they arranged to meet, he never kept to the arrangements and never did meet any of the victims.' Miss Brandon added: 'He told the women that on a trip to Africa he was the victim of a crime and needed money. The crime meant he could not access his own funds. 'He said they would get their money back and would be sent letters from the World Health Organisation to show that he would be able to pay them. 'These letters were sent, but from an M30 Manchester postmark. He also sent them links to websites which, when logging in with details he gave them, appeared to show that he had a huge bank balance and would eventually be able to pay them back. 'One woman was asked to pay for a hotel for him. When she rang the number he gave her for the hotel, they also confirmed the information and she agreed to pay it. 'She later received a cheque addressed to him for £35,000 to prove he had money, but this was later discovered to be a stolen cheque forged in his own handwriting. 'Over a number of months each woman transferred significant sums of money via bank accounts and Western Union moneygrams and sent items to the defendant's home address. They bought electronic items, took out credit cards and loans and bought clothes from Next. Adewole used a Royal Marine called Joshua McGowan's Facebook pictures to create a seemingly perfect Match.com profile to attract women . 'Many of the goods were sent to his home address in Eccles from where the victims believed they would be forwarded on to the defendant in Nigeria. 'When the women stopped sending money, they never heard from him again.' The court heard the total amount stolen including the value of the household goods and Western Union transfers was £98,140. Adewole was arrested in October 2012 at his flat and £4,500 in cash was found under his bed. A digital camera was found purchased by one of the victims, but containing pictures of the defendant and his wife and children. Designer clothes and shoes were also found worth £2,000. Adewole's wallet was also seized and contained several SIM cards, some of which contained the phone numbers of the victims. His two Blackberry phones were also seized - on these three different email accounts were in use which were linked to the two Match.com accounts. He was bailed and later tried to call one of the woman again under the name Timmy Francis and was arrested again. When questioned he claimed to know nothing of the orphanage but that the £4,500 was his and claimed the majority of the items found in his flat were to go to his mother in Nigeria. He added all he knew of the bank transfers was that his flatmate Samson Ajayi had asked him to have some money transferred to a relative - and claimed Mr Ajayi was responsible. He admitted he had used Match.com between 2010 and 2012 but could not remember when exactly. Detective Constable Sean Nicholls, from Greater Manchester Police, told the hearing: 'There has never been any evidence to prove there was someone else involved. 'There was possibly some help involved somewhere in Nigeria. There may well have been more than one person assisting him, male and female. 'But I believe any phone calls made to the victims were from the defendant himself. 'I believe Timmy Francis is a made-up name. I have made enquiries in our systems but there is nothing to suggest he exists.' Adewole, who arrived in UK in 2009 on a visa to study, said: 'The fraud was Samson's idea. I got involved because I had a few financial difficulties at the time. 'I did not speak with the complainants. I did not know money was being sent to Nigeria but I knew it was being sent to my bank account and my wife's bank account. 'I do not know where Samson is at the moment. He travels a lot. I have no idea about the details of this fraud. I didn't even know how many victims there were. 'But I pleaded guilty because if I had not let my bank account or flat be used, these women would not have suffered in the way that they did. 'Samson said he was expecting some money. He said he had no bank accounts to receive the money so I wanted to help him. He was owing me rent at the time and this was the only way he could pay me. ' Sentencing Adewole today, Judge David Stockdale said: 'The evidence against the defendant is, in my judgement, overwhelming. 'I am satisfied on the evidence I have heard of the facts that the defendant's role in the enterprise in which these four women were defrauded was a leading role. 'He was not working alone and others were involved but the use of his bank account and phones and the items found at his flat all indicate overwhelmingly that the defendant was a principle player. 'The man called Samson has not been traced. He may have been an accomplice.. If Samson was an accomplice and took part in this operation, that does not undermine my conclusion. That is my ruling on the issue.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Adewale Adewole, 31, has been jailed after admitting four charges of fraud .

"Four Kurdish fighters were buried in a makeshift cemetery today in the latest tragedy to have come out of Kobane since ISIS fighters waged an unrelenting attack on the border town. They were laid to rest by hordes of mourners in Suruc, Turkey, their ages emblazoned in red paint on rickety tombstones. Members of the YPG, the People's Protection Unit, they had been fighting tirelessly against the extremist group as it struggles to take hold of the border town. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of mourners carried the coffins of three Kurdish fighters into a makeshift cemetery today in the border town of Kobane as the conflict against ISIS continues . Their corpses now lie alongside 27 others who have perished in the conflict this month. ISIS holds part of the town but has been forced to retreat following persistent clashes with Kurdish forces in recent weeks. Their efforts have also been thwarted by sustained airstrikes by American and Arab forces. Today mourners wept as men carried wooden coffins through sandy streets and lowered them into shallow graves. The Kurdish flag was draped over each of their coffins, with mourners gesturing for peace as they carried them into the site. Earlier this week a young woman and two men were buried in the same cemetery after perishing in the battle for Kobane which began almost a month ago. Since the outbreak of war in Syria, more than 1million refugees are thought to have crossed the border into Turkey seeking safety. Praying for peace: The mourners followed the coffins into the cemetery where another 27 lie, their caskets draped in the Kurdish flag . The four fighters are the latest to have been slaughtered as clashes between Kurdish forces and the extremist group continue in Kobane . Children follow the coffin of one fighter as it is carried into the cemetery to be buried alongside others killed in the battle for Kobane . Women weep in the cemetery in the Turkish town of Suruc where dozens have been buried after perishing in the ongoing conflict .

Rows of tombstones pop up from the earth in Suruc where 30 have now been buried .

Pieces of paper with the fallen fighters' names and ages are taped to their coffins for mourners to remember when emblazoning their tomb stones with red paint . With so many civilians displaced, it is almost impossible to locate the family of each fighter who has died in the ongoing conflicts. Strangers carried the coffin of one woman to her grave in Suruc this week after being unable to contact her loved ones. Though they did not know the deceased, they wept for her sacrifice as they lowered her body into the ground. Only five of the thirty graves dug in the cemetery belong to fighters whose families have been found, it was reported. Tensions on the border town have flared in recent weeks with a series of American and Arab airstrikes obliterating the black ISIS flag once positioned on top of a hillside earlier this week. The strikes have devastated parts of the region with hundreds of homes destroyed. But, as a yellow Kurdish flag was raised on the same hillside today, signs the terror group has finally been thwarted were rife. A video released earlier this month depicted black-clad ISIS fighters patrolling the streets, allegedly keeping Yazidi virgins and young Syrian women locked in brothels for their pleasing. Small cells are thought to still be operating within the city, though joint attacks from Kurdish fighters and American and Arab air forces have undoubtedly weakened their position. Meanwhile images issued by the Syrian Arab News Agency reveal a stockpile of weapons seized by the Syrian Army in Hama . The missiles and their launchers are lined up in a rural region close to Morek as Syrian Army troops regain control of the area . Hundreds of rounds of ammunition were also seized by troops. Conflicts continue to rage across Syria with different groups fighting consistently .

She also witnessed male ISIS fighters be sexually violent towards their wives, resulting in some of them being so badly injured, they had to go to hospital. And with the commander of Khansa'a pressurising her into an arranged marriage, she decided to flee, just days before airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria and is now across the border in Turkey. She explained: 'I am not like this. I have a degree in education. I shouldn't be like this. What happened to me? What happened in my mind that brought me here?' Her story comes after Kurdish women have come to the forefront of the fight against ISIS in Syria. Yesterday, it was reported that Deilar Kanj Khamis, known by the nom de guerre Arin Mirkan, blew herself up at an ISIS position east of the border town of Kobane, killing ten jihadists.

"Furious residents have slammed a group of yobs who vandalised a Christmas tree dedicated to teen cancer hero Stephen Sutton. Hundreds of yellow ribbons had been tied to the tree which was erected in the late teenager's town of Burntwood, Staffordshire last weekend. But just days after his proud mother Jane switched on the lights in front of hundreds of supporters, thugs ripped off clusters of ribbons and smashed branches and lights. Organisers say they may now be forced to erect giant fences around the tree  to prevent future attacks. The Christmas Tree in Burntwood (pictured) was erected in memory of Stephen Sutton, who died earlier this year after a three year battle with cancer. Here the tree is pictured shortly after it was decorated . Stephen Sutton (pictured) in his hospital bed giving the thumbs up, a symbol that became synonymous with his campaigning for charity . Stephen Sutton (pictured) died in May, after having raised millions for the Teenager Cancer Trust while battling cancer himself . The yellow ribbons became a nationwide symbol of Stephen's battle with cancer as he raised £5million for the Teenage Cancer Trust before his death in May. He touched people across the world when a bucket list containing the 46 things he hoped to do before his death went viral. Stephen died in May aged just 19 after losing his fight with the disease. His mother, 50, collected her son's posthumous MBE from the Queen last month. Family friend Joanne Jarvis, who organised the tree ribbon tribute, said she had been left 'gutted' by the thefts. She said: 'I am absolutely gutted. I have been in tears, how can anyone be so disrespectful. 'We had hoped it was the wind but we now know for certain they were pulled off deliberately. 'I am just disgusted. I had asked for a low fence but now the council are considering a higher fence after this weekend.' Mrs Jarvis came up with the scheme to decorate the tree in yellow bows after noticing that those put up during Stephen's fight around the town had begun to weather. She spent weeks selling the ribbons for charity, raising an extra £1,500 for Stephen's cause. Now fellow residents are calling for the culprits to be punished. Vice chair of Burntwood Town Council Keith Willis-Croft, and Jane Sutton, the mother of Stephen Sutton, pictured during the official switching on of the Christmas tree lights . Jeremy French, 45, a welder who lives nearby, said: 'It's disgusting, there is no way you would imagine something like this should happen. 'The police need to get looking at CCTV and find these vandals and punish them as soon as possible. 'It's just not on, they were bought for charity to remember a hero, I can't understand the kind of person who would think this is OK.' Anne Timber, 67, added: 'You just wonder about some people these days. I hope they get what is coming to them. 'If local residents found out who did I they would have hell to pay, Stephen was such a shining light for our community. Hundreds attended the event (pictured) in Burntwood last weekend to see the Christmas tree lights switched on . 'These common thieves are the exact opposite.' Burntwood Town Council officer Brian Cooper said it wasn't the first time the town's Christmas tree had been targeted by vandals. He said: 'In previous years youths have pushed the tree around but we sincerely hoped that with this year being dedicated to Stephen Sutton they wouldn't do it. 'However, they have knocked a handful of bows off, which we have reattached. 'We hope this will be the end of it. But if it does happen again we will not have much choice but to put up a two metre high fence. 'We don't want to have to do it, but stopping people from ruining the tree is our priority.' Staffordshire Police confirmed they were investigating the vandalism. Stephen Sutton was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in September, 2010. Despite initially entering remission, the cancer returned four months later. By the following year, the cancer had spread to his pelvis and doctors diagnosed it as 'incurable', prompting the 19-year-old to draw up a 'bucklet list' of 46 things to do before he died. During this time he skydived, played the drums at Wembley, wrote a book, got a tattoo, crowdsurfed at a concert and hugged an elephant. Among his goals was a desire to raise £10,000 towards charity. However, his initial fundraising efforts quickly  snowballed far beyond anything he imagined, with the inspirational teenager triggering a movement that has gone on to raise £5million for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Stephen, pictured left with Prime Minister David Cameron in his trademark 'thumbs up' pose, and right with England and Manchester City footballer Frank Lampard . On May 11 this year, his condition deteriorated and he was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, where he passed away three days later. His death was met with tributes from David Cameron, Ed Miliband, celebrities, sports stars and others. Last month, he was posthumously recognised with an MBE at the Queen's Birthday Honours. Mr Cameron led tributes to the 19-year-old, praising his 'spirit and bravery', and hailing Stephen 'an inspiration'. He said: 'A very, very bright light has gone out. I'm deeply saddened to hear that Stephen Sutton has died. His spirit, bravery and fundraising for cancer research were all an inspiration.' Comedian Jason Manford, who helped to champion Stephen's fundraising, described him as the most inspiring person he had met. Upon his death, Manford said: 'He was an incredibly positive young man and a credit to his family, to Burntwood and to humanity itself. 'The reason we took to him so passionately was because he was better than us, he did something that none of us could even imagine doing. In his darkest hour he selflessly dedicated his final moments to raising millions of pounds for teenagers with cancer.' One of the items on Stephen's bucket list was to hug an animal bigger than himself. Here he is pictured being hugged by an elephant .","Residents of Burntwood are furious at the vandalism of Christmas tree .

"The parents of US aid worker Peter Kassig, who was beheaded by ISIS militants over the weekend, revealed on Twitter on Thursday that they adopted him at birth. 'We proudly acknowledge that we adopted our son, Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig, as a newborn,' Ed and Paula Kassig posted on the Kassig Family Twitter page at around 6pm Eastern time. 'We have always been, and will always be, grateful that his birthmother, Rhonda Schwindt, chose us to be his parents. Scroll down for videos . Adopted: Parents of slain aid worker Peter/Abdul-Rahman Kassig, seen standing in front of a truck filled with supplies for Syrian refugees, revealed on Twitter on Thursday that he was adopted at birth . Grateful: Ed and Paula Kassig, pictured  during a press conference on Monday, thanked Peter's birth mother for choosing them to raise her son as their own . The statement was posted at around 6pm naming Peter's birth mother, Rhonda Schwindt, and his two siblings . 'We know that she and Peter's siblings, Jana and Sam Schwindt, share in our grief.' The 26-year-old former US Army Ranger was taken captive while on a humanitarian mission to Syria in October 2013. On November 16, ISIS released a graphic video showing that Kassig, who had converted to Islam while in captivity, had been beheaded. Kassig's adoptive parents issued a statement Monday from their home in Indianapolis talking about the enormity of their loss and asking for prayers, but until today, nothing was known about the aid worker's biological family. According to a report by WTHR, Peter/Abdul-Rahman Kassig reunited with his birth family only eight years ago, not long after his 18th birthday. According to her Facebook page, Kassig’s mother, Rhonda Schwindt, works as an assistant professor at Indiana University School of Nursing. Reunited: Peter, seen here in the center surrounded by his birth family, reached out to them when he turned 18 years old . Mother's anguish: Rhonda Schwindt posted this message on Facebook less than a week before her son's execution . Special bond: Peter was very close to his sister, Jana (pictured), whom he nicknamed 'Little Punk' Touching moment: After Kassig's murder, his younger brother, Sam Schwindt, shared online this old photo of himself as a boy with Peter dressed in his US Army Rangers uniform . Schwindt has a college-age son and daughter, and she lives in Indianapolis with her new husband. On November 11, less than a week before the release of the gruesome ISIS video, Mrs Schwindt wrote on her Facebook wall: ‘I want my son Peter home safely.’ Peter Kassig's younger brother, 18-year-old Sam Schwindt, is currently a freshman at DePaul University in Chicago. On Thursday, Sam posted an old photo of himself as a young boy standing next to his big brother in his US Army Rangers uniform in front a monument engraved with 'Ranger Creed.' A day after the ISIS video recording was made public online, Sam shared a moving tribute to Kassig on his Facebook page. 'It's incredibly strange to lose someone you love,' he wrote. 'It just does not seem real. It always seems like in life that there will be more time, but you really can never know. Correspondence: Jana, pictured with her mother on Graduation Day, has received a letter from Peter during his captivity in Syria - one of only two letters home he was able to write . Family ties: Sam Schwindt, 18, is a freshman at DePaul University. His 20-year-old sister, Jana, works as a kennel attendant at the Indianapolis Humane Society . Regret: Just two days before Peter Kassig was captured by ISIS, he was supposed to have a video chat with Sam (left), but the teen ended up canceling because he had other plans at the time . 'Just please, for me, if you're not talking to someone you love, send them a message and reconnect. You never know when you may lose someone. I will always love you, Peter.' Much like her big brother, Jana Schwindt, 20, has dedicated her life to humanitarian work. Since August of this year, the 20-year-old has been working as a kennel attendant at the Indianapolis Humane Society. ‘True to how Peter lived his life, Jana has wanted to stay very busy, so she's been coming to work and working with our animals at our west side facility and continuing to live this compassion that is in this family,’ Humane Society COO Kirsten VantWoud told WTHR. This weekend, the Schwindts will hold a private remembrance ceremony for family and friends to honor Kassig's legacy. Believer: Peter Kassig, shown here working in Syria, converted to Islam while in captivity and took the given name Abdul-Rahman . No idle threat: Kassig is pictured with ISIS executioner Jihadi John, who threatens to behead him in a video for the terror group . Speaking to The Indianapolis Star, Jana and Sam Schwindt revealed that when Peter turned 18 years old, he reached out to them for the first time. Even though they only got to spend eight short years together, the three siblings reportedly developed a very close bond. According to Jana Schwindt, her big brother dubbed her 'Little Punk' and loved staying up late to watch the sitcom Elf with her. He even sent Jana a letter while being held hostage by ISIS - only one of two missives he was able to write home from his captivity. Just days before Kassig was captured in Syria in October 2013, he was supposed to have a video chat with Sam, his ‘Little Bro,’ but the teenager had to cancel because he had made plans with friends - a decision he regrets to this day.","Ed and Paula Kassig took to Twitter Thursday thanking Rhonda Schwindt, their son's birth mother, for choosing them to raise him .

"Mark Hill-Wood (pictured) was arrested on suspicion of fraud last week. He has used a string of different identities to dodge the authorities and escape bitter victims . A man accused of cheating the ex-wife of bankrupt tycoon Scot Young can be unmasked as a prolific fraudster and fantasist. Mark Hill-Wood, 50, approached Michelle Young and offered to find her former husband’s missing millions. She handed over thousands of pounds in the hope he would be able to break the deadlock after an acrimonious eight-year legal battle. But MailOnline can reveal Hill-Wood is a ‘Walter Mitty’ career conman. Our investigation has uncovered that the fraudster has hidden behind a string of different identities to dodge the authorities and escape bitter victims. He has been convicted of elaborate scams including cheating elite athletes in the run up to the Olympics and conning Harrods out of a £200,000 watch. The discovery is yet another twist to the incredible saga of the collapse of Mr Young’s empire and the bitter dispute over his lost wealth. His death after falling onto railings outside his £3m Marylebone penthouse home has prompted fierce speculation about what happened to his fortune. An inquest is expected to be opened this week but it could be several months before the full circumstances of his final hours are laid bare. Meanwhile Mrs Young, who has two grown up daughters, has indicated she will continue to fight to find her ex-husband’s money and get her £20m divorce settlement. She has employed a team of lawyers and private eyes in her search and was contacted by Hill-Wood in July. He told her he had set up his own private detective agency known as FullProof Intelligence, which is based at a postal box in the City. Here Hill-Wood (left) is pictured with British Formula 1 driver David Coulthard (right). The photo was taken after Hill-Wood received a package to attend the Monaco Grand Prix . Left, Hill-Wood's passport reveals his true identity. Right, he is pictured in Monaco during the Grand Prix. He once went by the name Philip Buffett and was labelled a 'fantasy fraudster' by a judge in April . Mrs Young handed over more than £14,000 but refused a request for further funds when Hill-Wood did not hand over dossiers of her ex-husband he claimed to have retrieved. She eventually reported him to the police and detectives from Surrey arrested him last Monday on suspicion of fraud offences. It can now be revealed that Hill-Wood was previously known as Phillip Buffett and was labelled a ‘fantasy fraudster’ by a judge in April. Then based in Croydon, South London, he was sentenced to a two year suspended jail sentence for duping Harrods out of a £200,000 watch. The hearing gained national attention when the judge pilloried him for wearing a Ralph Lauren shirt in the dock and asked, ‘what's wrong with M&S?’ Reading Crown Court heard Buffett has 48 previous convictions and he was branded ‘completely unsuccessful in all that you do’. The court was told he also cheated several companies and defrauding two men who applied to him for work under the umbrella of a company known as Uber Intelligence . One of the firms, a market leader in counter-explosive and IED products and training, was conned out of more than £27,000 pounds. Mrs Young (left), who has two grown up daughters, has indicated she will continue to fight to find her ex-husband Scot Young's (right) money and get her £20m divorce settlement . Scot Young's body was found by horrified residents in Marylebone after he had fallen 60ft onto the iron railings below his flat . Mr Young's body was found after he fell four storeys - but friends believe he would never have killed himself . In another fraud the defendant got a luxury package to watch the Monaco Grand Prix, including hospitality on the Mercedes F1 yacht. Photographs later emerged of him posing with former British Formula 1 racing driver David Coulthard during the racing.

"An 18-year-old black student who was shot to death by an off-duty St Louis police officer had gunshot residue on his hands, jeans and T-shirt, laboratory results have revealed. Vonderrit Myers was gunned down by the unidentified 32-year-old in Shaw, Missouri, last week, less than 10 miles from where unarmed teenager Michael Brown was killed by a cop in August. Police previously said that Myers had fired at least three times at the off-duty officer, who was working with a security company at the time, and that his weapon was recovered at the scene.

"A regiment of soldiers from a pint-sized battalion has been honoured 100 years after they volunteered for service in World War One. The Birkenhead Bantams were formed in November 1914 after the Wirral town's MP Alfred Bigland successfully petitioned for men of short stature to be allowed to enlist. Bigland's petition to the War Office led to the minimum height for soldiers in the Army to be lowered from five foot three inches, to just five foot. The pint-sized battalion has been honoured 100 years after they volunteered for service in World War One . As a result thousands of men who had been refused the chance to serve their country, were able to fight in the Great War. The Bantams, who were renamed the 15th and 16th Battalions, Cheshire Regiment, served in bloody battles including at Ypres and The Somme. By the end of the war in 1918, more than 900 officers and soldiers from the regiment had lost their lives fighting for Queen and country. A plaque has been unveiled at Birkenhead Town Hall, in Cheshire, and shows that 2,200 undersized recruits had joined the 1st and 2nd 'Bigland's Birkenhead Bantams' with four days of the war office reducing the minimum height for soldiers . MP Alfred Bigland's campaign to lower the minimum height for soldiers gained lots of media attention at the time, with newspapers such as the Daily Sketch featuring the petition (pictured) The Bantam battalions were first recruited in Cheshire following MP Alfred Bigland's petition, after he heard of a group of miners that had been  rejected from every recruiting office on account of their size. Soon renamed the 15th and 16th Battalions, Cheshire Regiment, the Bantams undertook gruelling training and served in some of the most hard fought battles of the war including  Ypres and The Somme. During WWI, two whole divisions, the 35th and the 40th, were formed from Bantams and tragically were virtually annihilated during the Battle of Ypres. Heavy casualties and the introduction of conscripted men of all heights eventually led to Bantam unit becoming indistinguishable from other regiments. The unit's centenary was marked at Birkenhead Town Hall attended by the Lord Lieutenant of Merseyside, veterans and members of the Armed Forces. A plaque was unveiled revealing that 2,200 undersized recruits joined the 1st and 2nd 'Bigland's Birkenhead Bantams' in just four days. Mayor of Wirral Cllr Steve Foulkes said: 'Birkenhead Town Hall has seen many important events but few can match the significance of those that unfolded in these very rooms exactly 100 years ago today. 'The story of those brave Birkenhead Bantams and their part in the history of the Great War is awe inspiring, and we owe them a debt we can never repay. 'We can, however, remember them, and make sure that their bravery and sacrifice is never forgotten - which is why this memorial and events such as this are so important.'","Birkenhead Bantams were formed in Cheshire after a petition by local MP .

"Martin O'Neill says he completely understands Roy Keane's decision to step down as Aston Villa assistant manager but is delighted he has further pledged his commitment to his role with the Republic of Ireland. Keane, who is O'Neill's No 2 at Ireland, decided to step down to concentrate more on his international duties.

O'Neill says he understands why Keane has stepped down from his role at the Premier League side, but has never had any issues with his commitment with him at Ireland so far. He told FAI TV : 'We had a brief discussion at the last international get together and I think Roy was more concerned about having that full commitment to the Aston Villa club job and ourselves. 'I never had a problem about his commitment to the Republic of Ireland though and I'm sure Paul (Lambert) didn't at Villa either. 'Everything I have expected him to bring to the table so far he has done - his commitment, enthusiasm and the strong desire that we know he possesses. 'Eventually those kind of things catch up with you either before or after Christmas though. 'Roy, being the perfectionist he is, wants to give everything to every single cause, and he was worried about this commitment issue of carrying both roles.' In a statement Keane explained his reasons for stepping down saying: . 'Ultimately, my roles with Villa and Ireland and combining my commitment to these have become too much. 'It isn't fair to either Villa or Ireland, so I've made this decision. The Irish assistant looks pensive on the bench alongside Lambert before the Southampton clash .

"A grandfather-of-five convicted of dangerous cycling has been left with a £3,000 legal bill for having his dog tethered to his bicycle. Ian Frankland, 54, used an extended dog lead fitted on his bicycle to take his German shepherd Mali for a walk by the river. But he was stopped by police who claimed the dog caused a traffic tailback which could have had 'catastrophic consequences' when it wandered into the middle of the road while trotting behind him. Scroll down for video . Grandfather-of-five Ian Frankland, 54 has been left with a £3,000 legal bill after he was convicted of dangerous cycling at Blackburn magistrates' court . The incident occurred in June in Clitheroe, Lancashire when Mr Frankland had used the Trixie Biker Set he bought on Amazon to take five year old Mali to the river where he planned to take pictures of wildlife . Mr Frankland was pulled over by police when Mali trotted in to the middle of the road behind him . When a police constable told Mr Frankland to pull over on the road that varies in speed limit between 30mph and 50mph, he tried to ride off before pulling out a camcorder to start filming the officer, a court was told. Mr Frankland was then detained and placed in the back of a police van when he initially refused to give his personal details. He relented when he was told Mali would be placed in kennels. He was found guilty at Blackburn magistrates' court of dangerous cycling on a public road and failing to stop when directed by a police officer and failing to give his name and address. He was fined £260, with £340 costs. He now faces a bill of £2,000 for his own defence costs. The maximum fine for dangerous cycling under the Road Traffic Act 1988 is £2,500. Today, Mr Frankland, a mechanic, said: 'The whole thing is outrageous - I've been made to feel like a bank robber when as far as I'm concerned, I've done nothing wrong. I'm not allowed to cycle on pavements so I had to go on the road and as far as I could see the traffic flowed fine. 'I wasn't going at any break neck speed, vehicles were going past and I wasn't causing any obstruction. It's ridiculous that I'm now being branded a danger to the roads. 'There are so many on the internet and when researching them they are the safest way of riding a bike with a dog. 'Everyone recommends them even the veterinary practices because it's one of the best forms of exercise. This was ideal because it was quick release and it had an expanding lead. 'I'd used it 30 or 40 times myself and my wife mainly on country roads to get some exercise and him having a runabout. Now I'm warning other people not to use it after what's happened. In my eyes I've not broken the law.' Mr Frankland was spotted cycling on Mitton Road in Clitheroe with Mali behind him when he was pulled over . The 54-year-old said he did not believe he had committed a criminal offence when he cycled along the road . The incident took place in June and Mr Frankland was detained and placed in the back of a police van when he initially refused to give his personal details - he is pictured here being brought home by police . Mr Frankland shows the extended bike lead to a police officer after he was taken home following his detention . The incident occurred in June in Clitheroe, Lancashire when Mr Frankland had used the Trixie Biker Set he bought on Amazon to take five year old Mali to the river where he planned to take pictures of wildlife. He added: 'We set off back and I wasn't holding anyone up on the road. There was nothing stuck behind me, it was 120 yards of straight road, there are no double white lines so anyone wishing to overtake me could have done. 'Traffic only stopped when the police officer pulled up in a van and told me to stop. He shouted stuck his head out of the window and said ""that's inappropriate."" 'I simply said I was on my way home. I dismounted but he came running down and grabbed me by the shirt and neck and pulled my bike and wanted my address. 'I got my camcorder out because I'd seen on BBC Breakfast that under no account did people need to give their details to a police officer if they hadn't committed an offence but he took me to the back of the van and threw the mountain bike into the hedge and was frisking me and patting me down. 'I said ""what do you think you are doing?"". He said he was searching me to make sure there was nothing that can harm me or him.' PC John Scorah told the court he was driving along Mitton Road (pictured) when he saw Mr Frankland cycling towards him . Mr Frankland said: 'For anyone to accuse me of being a bad dog owner it really disgusts me. I would give my own life before seeing my dog come to any harm' Mr Frankland said he was later kept in cells at Burnley Police station for three hours. He added: 'The prosecution kept saying if I pleaded to a lesser charge they would let the rest go and I'd have a £40 fine but my wife and I didn't think that is British justice. 'I kept saying I was was not guilty. I was literally being badgered into a situation where they wanted me to plead guilty to a lesser charge but that's not me. I can't live my life on a lie. 'My wife has told told me to sell the bike and everything with it because she is that disheartened. I'm feeling like I've been penalised for being a law abiding citizen and trying to be healthy and keeping my dog healthy. 'For anyone to accuse me of being a bad dog owner it really disgusts me. I would give my own life before seeing my dog come to any harm. 'I was very disappointed at the verdict. I thought we are meant to have the best justice system in the world. Even my own barrister said he had never come across this. I've driven motorbikes, wagons, motor homes and cars - why should I be victimised for something like this?' A court heard Mr Frankland was close to the kerb but his dog, Mali (pictured here as a puppy), was near to the central white line and there were a queue of cars behind him . In court PC John Scorah told the court he was driving along Mitton Road when he saw Mr Frankland cycling towards him. Mr Frankland was close to the kerb but his dog, Mali, was near to the central white line and there were a queue of cars behind him. PC Scorah said: 'I had never seen anything like it in 25 years of policing. I stopped and shouted out of my window for him to stop. 'There is no way a dog should be running or walking down the centre of the road, let alone tied to a bicycle. If there had been a reaction to a cat or a person or anything like that the consequences could have been catastrophic.' PC Scorah said he had to run after Frankland and take hold of his bike to make him stop. He said: 'He pulled out a camcorder and started filming me. I didn't want to arrest him and would probably have dealt with the whole matter with a caution if he had co-operated.' After the case Nick Lloyd, of The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), said: 'Riding with your dog may act as a visual distraction and has the potential to affect your balance. Even animals that are well-trained may be distracted. RoSPA would not recommend cycling and leading a dog in a road environment.'","Ian Frankland convicted of dangerous cycling and left with £3,000 legal bill .

"They were feasts of sublime asparagus - laced with fear. And for more than half a century, Margot Woelk kept her secret hidden from the world, even from her husband. Then, a few months after her 95th birthday, she revealed the truth about her wartime role: Adolf Hitler's food taster. Woelk, then in her mid-twenties, spent two and a half years as one of 15 young women who sampled Hitler's food to make sure it wasn't poisoned before it was served to the Nazi leader. She worked at the 'Wolf's Lair' - his heavily guarded command centre in what is now Poland, where he spent much of his time in the final years of World War II. Every meal that Adolf Hitler tasted was sampled by 15 young women, including Margot Woelk, to make sure it wasn't poisoned. Above, the dictator with his mistress Eva Braun . A few months after her 95th birthday, Margot Woelk revealed the truth about her wartime role, which she had even kept secret from her husband . Margot holds a photo album with a picture of herself taken around 1939 or 1940 . 'He was a vegetarian. He never ate any meat during the entire time I was there,' Woelk said of the Nazi leader. 'And Hitler was so paranoid that the British would poison him - that's why he had 15 girls taste the food before he ate it himself.' With many Germans battling with food shortages and a bland diet as the war dragged on, sampling Hitler's food had its advantages. 'The food was delicious, only the best vegetables, asparagus, bell peppers, everything you can imagine. And always with a side of rice or pasta,' she recalled. 'But this constant fear - we knew of all those poisoning rumors and could never enjoy the food. Every day we feared it was going to be our last meal.' The petite widow's story is a tale of the horror, pain and dislocation endured by people of all sides who survived the war. A pre-WWII photo from Margot's album shows the way to the later-built Fuhrer's HQ 'Wolf's Lair' where she performed her duties . 'The food was delicious, only the best vegetables, asparagus, bell peppers, everything you can imagine. And always with a side of rice or pasta,' Woelk said . Only now in the sunset of her life has she been willing to relate her experiences, which she had buried because of shame and the fear of prosecution for having worked with the Nazis, although she insists she was never a party member. She has also provided album pictures of her as a young woman, in the same Berlin apartment where she was born in 1917. Woelk said her association with Hitler began after she fled Berlin to escape Allied air attacks. With her husband gone and serving in the German army, she moved in with relatives about 435 miles (700km) to the east in Rastenburg, then part of Germany; now it is Ketrzyn, in what became Poland after the war. There she was drafted into civilian service and assigned for the next two and a half years as a food taster and kitchen bookkeeper at the Wolf's Lair complex, located a few miles outside the town. 'Hitler was so paranoid that the British would poison him - that's why he had 15 girls taste the food before he ate it himself,' said Margot. Above, Adolf the vegetarian with German officers in 1945 . Above, tourists visit the ruins of the Wolf's Lair in Ketrzyn, north-eastern Poland. It was there, on July 20, 1944, that a trusted colonel detonated a bomb in an attempt to kill Hitler . Hitler survived the assassination attempt but nearly 5,000 people were executed afterwards, including the bomber, Claus Von Stauffenberg . Hitler was so secretive, even in the relative safety of his headquarters, that she never saw him in person - only his German shepherd Blondie and his SS guards, who chatted with the women. And the Fuhrer's security fears were not unfounded. On July 20, 1944, a trusted colonel detonated a bomb in the Wolf's Lair in an attempt to kill him. He survived, but nearly 5,000 people were executed following the assassination attempt, including the bomber. 'We were sitting on wooden benches when we heard and felt an incredible big bang,' she said of the 1944 bombing. 'We fell off the benches, and I heard someone shouting ""Hitler is dead!"" But he wasn't.' Following the blast, tension rose around the headquarters. Woelk said the Nazis ordered her to leave her relatives' home and move into an abandoned school closer to the compound. With the Soviet army on the offensive and the war going badly for Germany, one of her SS friends advised her to leave the Wolf's Lair. She said she returned by train to Berlin and went into hiding. Woelk said the other women on the food tasting team decided to remain in Rastenburg since their families were all there and it was their home. 'Later, I found out that the Russians shot all of the 14 other girls,' she said. It was after Soviet troops overran the headquarters in January 1945. When she returned to Berlin, she found a city facing complete destruction. Round-the-clock bombing by U.S. and British planes was grinding the city centre to rubble. On April 20, 1945, Soviet artillery began shelling the outskirts of Berlin and ground forces pushed through towards the heart of the capital against strong resistance by die-hard SS and Hitler Youth fighters. Feast: Hitler and his officers sit at a table laden with fresh fruit and vegetables before the war . After about two weeks of heavy fighting, the city surrendered on May 2 - after Hitler, who had abandoned the Wolf's Lair about five months before, had committed suicide. His successor surrendered a week later, ending the war in Europe. For many Berlin civilians - their homes destroyed, family members missing or dead and food almost gone - the horror did not end with capitulation. 'The Russians then came to Berlin and got me, too,' Woelk said. 'They took me to a doctor's apartment and raped me for 14 consecutive days. That's why I could never have children. They destroyed everything.' Like millions of Germans and other Europeans, Woelk began rebuilding her life and trying to forget as best she could her bitter memories and the shame of her association with a criminal regime that had destroyed much of Europe. She worked in a variety of jobs, mostly as a secretary or administrative assistant. Her husband returned from the war but died 23 years ago, she said. With the frailty of advanced age and the lack of an elevator in her building, she has not left her apartment for the past eight years. Nurses visit several times a day, and a niece stops by frequently, she said. Now at the end of her life, she feels the need to purge the memories by talking about her story. 'For decades, I tried to shake off those memories,' she said. 'But they always came back to haunt me at night.'","Margot Woelk, then in her mid-twenties, spent .

"Shopping on Oxford Street could damage your health according to new research by the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust. Scientists found that healthy people exposed to the fumes of buses and taxis for just two hours suffered damage to their arteries. People with pre-existing respiratory complaints such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema saw their lung capacity reduced after breathing in the toxic traffic fumes. Researchers found that standing for two hours on Oxford Street in London could damage your health . Much of the damage is caused by nitrogen dioxide pollution which is produced mainly by diesel vehicles such as London buses and taxi cabs. Scientist believe that microscopic carbon particles, produced by diesel vehicles, can pass through the lungs, into the blood, increasing the risk of a heart attack. During the summer, researchers from King's College in London discovered that Oxford Street had the world's highest recorded levels of nitrogen dioxide. It is believed that the shape of Oxford Street, with tall buildings either side, traps in the deadly fumes. Rudy Sinharay, who worked on the study, told The Times: 'Airways obstruction and a stiffening of the arteries occurred in both the healthy volunteers and people with lung disease, even after limited exposure to diesel pollution. 'On the hole, the major health risk is cumulative over a long period of time. Christmas shoppers shouldn't panic, but it would be wise for people with chronic lung or heart disease to check the air pollution forecast and limit their exposure on very polluted days.' Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation said the study proved the need to reduce traffic pollution in order to protect people's health. Last month, the European Court found the UK was in breach of an EU law concerning air pollution in 16 cities. The court warned the government has until January 2015 to act, or face action. The fumes from diesel buses and taxis on Oxford Street can harden the arteries, even in healthy people . Under existing plans, the worst areas - including London, Birmingham and Leeds - would not meet the pollution limits until 2030, campaigners say. Britain breached EU targets in 2010 for levels of nitrogen dioxide, a gas particle from car engines and factories which causes breathing and heart problems. It is still nowhere near adequate levels, and has repeatedly asked to be granted extensions to the EU deadline. The European court, which is based in Luxembourg, ruled that the UK’s Supreme Court now has jurisdiction over the matter and must order the Government to take action to meet the legal limits in a much shorter time frame. The Government is also facing a separate £300million fine for failing to meet the EU’s air quality directive on pollution. Some 16 areas including Greater London, Greater Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield and the West Midlands are currently in breach of the targets. The problem was dramatically illustrated in April when a thick smog enveloped the country, forcing people to stop exercising and schools to keep their children inside. Environmental lawyers ClientEarth, who brought the case against Defra, the Government’s environment department, said the ruling is likely to mean rolling out London’s planned ‘ultralow emissions zone’ to cities across the country. The plan, drawn up by Boris Johnson, will mean charging diesel car owners £10 to enter the city centre and scrapping old taxis. ClientEarth lawyer Alan Andrews said: ‘Thousands of people die because of air pollution every year. This ruling will save lives by forcing the Government to finally take this issue seriously.’ London's St Paul's Cathedral is barely visible due to the heavy pollution blanketing the capital . Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘This European Court of Justice judgement is a damning indictment of the Tory-led Government’s total failure to tackle the UK’s air pollution. ‘Air pollution is a serious public health issue facing our towns and cities, tens of thousands of lives are lost each year and yet David Cameron’s government has done nothing to solve the problem. ‘The European Court of Justice has now demanded that the UK take urgent action to address dangerous levels of air pollution.’ MP Joan Walley, chair of the parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee, added: ‘Ministers have complacently carried on with business as usual and put off serious efforts to deal with the problem for another decade. ‘It is not acceptable for ministers who live in leafy suburbs to tell people living next to busy roads in towns and cities that they have to wait until 2030 to breath clean air.’ A Defra spokesman said: ‘Air quality has improved significantly in recent years and average roadside concentrations of NO2 levels have fallen 15 per cent since 2010. ‘We have built on this by committing £2 billion since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles, green transport initiatives and supporting local authorities to take action.’","Volunteers suffered breathing problems in Oxford Street air after two hours .

Conditions and the opposition dictated a physical approach and you will always be guaranteed that from Robshaw . It's all gone a bit flat in this final quarter at Twickenham . Too many subs have stopped momentum and I'm disappointed with Farrell coming off. He needed every minute and subs have cost momentum . The Twickenham crowd appear to be unimpressed by Owen Farrell's recent performances for England, judging by their reaction to his departure. For the second successive week, the home fans have loudly cheered the announcement that the Saracens player was being replaced - this time by Billy Twelvetrees. In truth, he was better this time, but still not back up to normal match sharpness. Owen Farrell leaves the pitch to be be replaced by Billy Twelvetrees. Hasn't been an easy night for the Saracens fly half. One heartening aspect of England's improved performance since half-time is that they have started being smarter with their decision-making. Mike Brown's try stemmed from a cross-kick by George Ford that was flat and fast, to prevent the cover defence drifting across quickly enough to snuff out the danger, while Anthony Watson was wise to off-load rather than showing the winger's instinct to lunge for the line himself. For Jonny May's try, England sensibly used their pack to drive a rolling maul into the Samoan 22, dragging in defenders and thus creating the space for an overlap. England capitalise on their extra man almost immediately. Quick hands from Attwood, Robshaw, Marler and Brown releases May for his second try in the left corner. Ford fails with the touchline conversion. Ford copped a massive hit from Sale Sharks centre Jonny Leota. It seemed a bit high but looks a harsh call. England have a one-man advantage for 10 minutes . Tusi Pisi knocks over another three-pointer for the visitors. Samoa holding on, but only just. That’s more like it! Ford stabs a beautiful cross-kick to Anthony Watson who offloads to Mike Brown and the Harlequins full back crashes over for England’s second try. Ford converts and England are up and running in the second half. Must get some real basics back into the game. I really want to see our kicking game work with 10/12 putting us into good positions. I want to see territory dominated by England . Perfect start to the second half. England go through the phases and Samoa lock Kane Thompson is penalised for going off his feet at the ruck. Ford makes no mistake from the tee to open up a two-score gap. That was grim. The conditions have made an already disjointed encounter awful to watch. The crowd have become decidedly restless before half-time. In the absence of any dynamic rugby, spectators at logo-laden Twickenham are being 'treated' to a rolling display of tweets, pictures of fans and sponsored statistics on the myriad electronic screens. Amid the corporate over-load, all anyone present wants is some enthralling action to savour. Ford's long range penalty falls short on the stroke of half-time. The rain is bucketing down at Twickenham. Jonny May's try has been the highlight of a scrappy, error-strewn first 40 minutes from England. Ford has had some bright moments and the set piece is going well, but England's attacking shape is still looking lateral and predictable. This is how England can build a score to win this game - turn the screw up front in the set piece contest. Their scrum was always likely to be dominant and that is proving to be the case, so in the absence of any great conviction in other areas, and with the rain coming down, they can grind this out. It might not be pretty, but it is legitimate and they simply must win. Style is a secondary target tonight. Another monster scrum from the England pack has Samoa in all sorts of trouble. Ford steps up to increase the home side's lead. Great play from Marler, Webber and Wilson. Tusi Pisi makes no mistake this time as Samoa eat into England's lead. England would have been bracing themselves for defensive physicality from the Samoans and that is certainly what they've faced so far. The visitors' abrasive tackling has shaken Stuart Lancaster's side, with Filo Paulo's brutal hit on George Ford setting the damaging tone. So far, Samoa are the side showing more cohesion. England are relying on individual bursts of pace and footwork, but their midfield is cluttered and static, and their passing is ordinary. England's discipline has disappointing. First Haskell and now Brown. Farrell needs to stay out of the rucks unless he is totally required. There are a lot of forwards stood out wide in the backline; they need to get closer to the rucks and go route one into the Samoan defence. Ford runs a great loop with Farrell and plays in Mike Brown who releases Gloucester flyer Jonny May into space and he finishes next to the posts. Ford adds the extras to settle England down. England squeeze a penalty out of the Samoans at scrum time. Ford steps up to draw his side level. That's a bit better from the home side. Tusi Pisi misses a shot right in front from 30 metres out after James Haskell was penalised for hands in the ruck. That would have given the visitors a well deserved 6-0 lead. A let off for England. 9min: England playing with plenty of endeavour early on but Samoa very much enjoying knocking their runners back. Another big Samoan hit again. This time on England winger Anthony Watson . England on the attack here but George Ford gets clattered by Samoa lock Filo Paulo. Tusi Pisi has a chance to give Samoa an early lead . 'Sweet Chariot' rings out around Twickenham as the Samoans lay down their challenge to Chris Robshaw and co . Fans of the Aviva Premiership will recognise several of Samoa's startling line-up with includes the Pisi brothers and Kahn Fotuali'i from Northampton and Wasps three-quarter Alapati Leiua. All eyes will be on England new 10-12 axis this evening . Lancaster has shifted Owen Farrell to inside centre to accommodate George Ford at fly half. The pair rose through the underage ranks together as a formidable 10-12 partnership but this is the first time they have started at Test match alongside each other. How will the pair cope against the super physical Samoans tonight? Kick-off is 15 minutes away... England: Mike Brown; Anthony Watson, Brad Barritt, Owen Farrell, Jonny May; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Ben Morgan, Chris Robshaw (c), James Haskell; Courtney Lawes, Dave Attwood; David Wilson,  Rob Webber,  Joe Marler . Replacements: Dylan Hartley, Matt Mullan, Kieran Brookes, George Kruis, Tom Wood, Richard Wigglesworth, Billy Twelvetrees, Marland Yarde . Samoa: Ken Pisi; Alapati Leiua, Reynold Lee-Lo, Johnny Leota, David Lemi; Tusi Pisi, Kahn Fotuali'i; Ofisa Treviranus, Jack Lam, Maurie Fa'asavalu; Kane Thompson, Filo Paulo; Census Johnston, Ti'i Paulo, Zak TaulafoReplacements: Manu Leiataua, Viliamu Afatia, Anthony Perenise, Fa'atiga Lemalu, Dan Leo, TJ Ioane, Pete Cowley, Mike Stanley. The England squad have arrived at Twickenham. This is a must-win game for Lancaster's men . Head coach Stuart Lancaster has swung the axe following two disappointing displays against New Zealand and South Africa in recent weeks. Billy Vunipola and Danny Care Care have been the biggest casualties with both players dropping out of the matchday squad altogether.

"ISIS militants have publicly shot dead 36 Sunni men, women and children in Iraq's Anbar region, pushing the number of people slain there by the extremists in recent days to more than 200. It has also emerged that ISIS fighters beat Kurdish children taken from the besieged Syrian border town of Kobane with electrical cables. They are the latest examples of the brutal reign of terror inflicted by ISIS over parts of Iraq and Syria. ISIS has publicly shot dead 36 Sunni tribesmen, women and children, pushing the number of members slain  to more than 200. This picture, issued by the Raqqa Media Office of ISIS, shows fighting in Kobane, Syria . It has also emerged that ISIS fighters beat Kurdish children taken from the besieged Syrian border town of Kobane with electrical cables. Pictured, an ISIS militant fighting in the town . The bodies of Sunni fighters after they were shot by a group of gunmen on a main street of the town of Hit, 85 miles (140 kilometers) west of Baghdad, Iraq, last week . Sheik Naim al-Gaoud, a senior figure in the Al Bu Nimr tribe, said the militant group killed 29 men, four women and three children, lining them up in in the village of Ras al-Maa, north of Ramadi in Anbar province. He said the extremists shot each of them dead one by one. The tribal leader warned that 120 families were still trapped there. 'These massacres will be repeated in the coming days unless the government and its security forces help the trapped people,' Mr al-Gaoud said. Some Sunnis in Anbar province supported the militants when they seized the city of Fallujah and parts of Ramadi in December. That came after widespread Sunni protests against Iraq's Shiite-led government in Baghdad for what they described as second-class treatment. These recent slayings, all committed in public, raise the death toll suffered by the Sunni Al Bu Nimr tribe in recent days at the hands of the Islamic State group to at least 214 tribal members killed. Analysts believe Islamic State may be trying to take revenge for the tribe siding with the American forces in the past, as well as Iraqi security forces. Four of the children who were released said they were held by the extremists in the northern Syrian town of Manbij. They described abuse at the hands of the militants, who used an electric cable to administer beatings. The eyes of the world have been on Kobane, where weeks of fighting have taken place within full view of the Turkish border. Pictured, ISIS militants in the town . Kobane has become a symbolic test of the U.S.-led coalition's ability to halt the advance of ISIS, which has poured weapons and fighters into its assault of the town that has lasted more than a month . The killings will also likely terrify other Sunni tribes that would think of resisting the militants. Since the Islamic State group's offensive, a number of Iraq's Sunni tribes have been fundamental in stalling its advance, taking up arms and fighting alongside Iraqi security forces. A U.S.-led campaign of airstrikes is targeting the group as well, with nine strikes hitting its fighters yesterday and today in Beiji, Fallujah and Ar Rutbah, U.S. Central Command said. Meanwhile, Islamic State militants tortured and abused Kurdish children captured earlier this year near the northern Syrian town of Kobane, according to an international rights group. Human Rights Watch based its conclusions on interviews with several children who were among more than 150 Kurdish boys from Kobane abducted in late May as they were returning home after taking school exams in the city of Aleppo. It said around 50 of the Kurds escaped early in their captivity, while the rest were released in batches - the last on October 29. An ISIS fighter holds a flag and a weapon on a street in the Iraqi city of Mosul . Iraqi army soldiers aim their weapons on the front line  in Jurf al-Sakhar. Sunni tribesmen have complained the government is not supporting them enough . 'Since the beginning of the Syrian uprising, children have suffered the horrors of detention and torture, first by the Assad government and now by ISIS,' said Human Rights Watch spokesman Fred Abrahams. 'This evidence of torture and abuse of children by ISIS underlines why no-one should support their criminal enterprise.' Four of the children who were released told Human Rights Watch they were held by the extremists in the northern Syrian town of Manbij. They described frequent abuse at the hands of the militants, who used a hose and electric cable to administer beatings. The boys said some of the worst abuse was reserved for captives who had family members in the Kurdish militia known as the YPG, which has been locked in heavy fighting with Islamic State militants for control of Kobane since mid-September. The children said ISIS did not say why they were being released, other than they had completed their religious training, the Human Rights Watch report said. ISIS militants have taken hundreds of Kurds captive over the past year as part of the group's brutal campaign to take over predominantly Kurdish areas of northern and eastern Syria. Today, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the extremists had released dozens of Kurds taken captive in February. It was not immediately clear why ISIS group would release the captives now, nor whether a deal had been made with the Kurds for a prisoner exchange. ISIS has also released images of their fighters engaging in street fighting in Kobane today. The pictures show jihadis firing rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles in the ruined streets of the town.","Militants have publicly shot dead 36 Sunni tribesmen, women and children .

"The NFL could be a step closer to bringing a team to London following the end of a run of sold-out games at Wembley this year. Mark Waller, the vice president of the international NFL, said he and the NFL commissioner were getting 'a lot of good support' from the Government as they left an early morning meeting with George Osborne on Monday. The Chancellor has previously said the Government 'will do anything' to secure an American football team in London on a long-term basis. Dallas Cowboy's quarterback Tony Romo (centre) led them to victory vs Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday . Sunday night saw the third and final game to be played in front of a total 250,000-strong crowd in London this season, bringing in estimated revenues of £3million per game. Mr Waller said about Monday's meeting: 'We were talking about the progress we have made in the UK, the growing fan base we've got and the increasing interest - both our interest in playing here and the fans' interest. It seems to be mutual. 'We were talking through our growth plan and what we would like to see. 'The Government is interested and asking if there's anything they can do. Dallas' win at Wembley was the third NFL regular season game to be held there this year . 'We've had great meetings with the Chancellor and with Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid. We've got a sense of a lot of good support. We're very happy with the relationship we're building. 'I think it's great for London.

"Marines who guarded Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons compound in Iraq were particularly fearful of one bunker they dubbed the 'dragon's egg'. American soldiers posted to the Muthanna State Establishment were never allowed to look inside the vast three-square-mile site, where up to 4,000 tonnes of deadly Sarin was produced each year. But former guard Joshua Hartley revealed to Fox News's Paul Alster there was an ominous feeling surrounding one X-shaped bunker - which is now in the hands of Islamic State fighters. A CIA picture of the Muthanna State Establishment, which produced chemical weapons on an industrial scale . Remnants of Iraq's chemical weapons program at the Muthanna State Establishment. It was destroyed by American bombs during the 1991 Gulf War . 'We were made aware of a particular bunker on the north side [of Al Muthanna] which we were informed was sealed and remotely monitored,' Hartley, who served in the weapons company of the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, told FoxNews.com. 'We were not to approach, and definitely not to attempt to enter.' Despite conflicting claims about the nature of weaponry held at the 'dragon's egg', Hartley insists he has no doubt it produced liquid nerve agents after his platoon was ordered to clean the area surrounding it. He told  Paul Alster: 'When we began searching, we discovered a huge stockpile of 105-millimeter artillery shells that were filled with mustard gas. 'I have always wondered why it never became big news, as well as other incidents. I never doubted the existence of chemical and biological weapons in Iraq.' One Marine, he said, 'picked [a shell] up and could literally hear the liquid sloshing around inside of it.' The enter site was bombed by the US during the 1991 Gulf War, but the munitions there were only partially destroyed, according to the UN - then left to Iraq to take care of. However, Iraqi officials wrote to the United Nations this summer claiming that abandoned weapons containing Sarin are still in the ruins of the Muthanna State Establishment, which made chemical weapons in the 1980s and early 1990s. This is now in the hands of the violent jihadists. They warned that they had watched equipment there being looted on CCTV. Cache: Isis controls a compound in Iraq containing 2,500 chemical weapons rockets, according to the Iraqi government. Pictured are Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal technicians preparing unexploded ordnance for demolition at a safe disposal area near Baghdad in 2003 . A U.S. Army Third Infantry Division soldier loads materials discovered in an explosives laboratory hidden in a home April 15, 2003 in Baghdad, Iraq . Militants then shut the surveillance cameras at the depot down, the New York Times reported. Iraq's UN Ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim wrote to the UN saying that 'armed terrorist groups' took over the Muthanna complex, which lies 60 miles north of Baghdad, on June 11. In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim said remnants of a former chemical weapons programme are kept in two bunkers there. 'The project management spotted at dawn on Thursday, 12 June 2014, through the camera surveillance system, the looting of some of the project equipment and appliances, before the terrorists disabled the surveillance system,' Alhakim wrote in the letter dated June 30. 'The Government of Iraq requests the States Members of the United Nations to understand the current inability of Iraq, owing to the deterioration of the security situation, to fulfill its obligations to destroy chemical weapons,' he said. The Muthanna complex measures three by three miles and was thought to be capable of producing around 4,000 tonnes of nerve agent a year. Alhakim singled out the capture of bunkers 13 and 41 in the sprawling complex 35 miles (56 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad in the notorious 'Sunni Triangle.' The last major report by U.N. inspectors on the status of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program was released about a year after the experts left in March 2003. It states that Bunker 13 contained 2,500 sarin-filled 122-mm chemical rockets produced and filled before 1991, and about 180 tons of sodium cyanide, 'a very toxic chemical and a precursor for the warfare agent tabun.' However, U.S. Defence Department spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said earlier that the United States' best understanding was that 'whatever material was kept there is pretty old and not likely to be able to be accessed or used against anyone right now'. 'We aren't viewing this particular site and their holding it as a major issue at this point,' Kirby said. 'Should they even be able to access the materials, frankly, it would likely be more of a threat to them than anyone else.' It was revealed this week that about 5,000 chemical weapons were recovered or destroyed in Iraq following the 2003 invasion but the Pentagon chose to keep the findings top secret. An investigation by The New York Times has revealed that U.S. forces happened across the hidden caches of warheads, shells and aviation bombs between 2004 and 2011. Secrets: In 2002 President George W. Bush said Hussein was developing a program of chemical weapons but no evidence of such weapons was ever found . But the information wasn't made public for several embarrassing reasons including the fact some of the weapons were U.S.-made, plus they had been sitting dormant since the early 1980s and therefore didn't support President George W. Bush's rationale for going to war. The weapons - most of them mustard agents in 155-millimeter artillery shells or 122-millimeter rockets - were developed by Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war which raged between 1980 and 1988. But on September 12, 2002, President Bush had contended that Hussein was developing new chemical weapons capable of 'mass destruction'. 'Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons,' he said. But all the weapons found had been developed before 1991. In March 2003, President Bush received a mandate from the U.S. Congress to lead an invasion of Iraq, asserting that Iraq was in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1441. With strong support from British P.M. Tony Blair, the Bush administration claimed that Sadam and his forces were in possession of weapons of mass destruction that posed a threat to U.S. security and that of allies including the U.K. and Australia. After investigation following the invasion, the U.S. led Iraq Survey Group concluded that Iraq had ended its nuclear, chemical and biological programs in 1991 and had no active programs at the time of the invasion, but that they intended to resume production if the Iraq sanctions were lifted. Although no active chemical weapons program was found, at least 17 U.S. troops and 7 Iraqi police officers were burned or wounded when chemical devices exploded. President Bush later said that the biggest regret of his presidency was 'the intelligence failure' in Iraq, while the Senate Intelligence Committee found in 2008 that his administration 'misrepresented the intelligence and the threat from Iraq'. The U.S. completed its withdrawal of military personnel in December 2011, during the ninth year of the war. The rise of ISIS means that the U.S. will send an army headquarters to Iraq for the first time in three years to assist local security forces struggling to resist advances by the fundamentalist group. Another reason for the cover-up, according to The Times, was that five of the six chemical weapons encounters involved weapons designed by the U.S. '''Nothing of significance'' is what I was ordered to say,' said Jarrod Lampier, a now-retired Army major who was present when forces found 2,400 nerve agent rockets in 2006 - the largest chemical weapons discovery of the war. Soldiers were also loathe to report finding the caches as documenting chemical weapons added hours of extra work to their load. Chemical warfare specialists had to be called in, and waiting for them to arrive put coalition forces in dangerous positions. 'I could wait all day for tech escort to show up and make a chem round disappear, or I could just make it disappear myself,' one ex-soldier told The Times. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (centre) is greeted as he arrives at Vienna International Airport. He's in the country to discuss Iran's nuclear program . The mustard shells could be put in with other explosives that needed to be destructed and then detonated. However, handling chemical weapons lead to many injuries, which were not taken seriously by military doctors at the time. Many explosive ordnance disposal personnel were not aware that the shells they were handling contained chemicals, believing them to be regular old artillery. At least 17 American military personnel and seven Iraqi police were sickened by poisons - usually sarin and mustard gases. Many of the shells would leak liquid during transportation, exposing the soldiers to the potentially-lethal fumes. Symptoms ranged from disorientation and nausea to blindness and huge, seething blisters. Jarrod Taylor, a former Army sergeant on hand for the destruction of mustard shells that burned two soldiers in his infantry company, joked of 'wounds that never happened' from 'that stuff that didn't exist'. 'I love it when I hear, ''Oh there weren't any chemical weapons in Iraq'',' he said. 'There were plenty.'","Joshua Hartley describes ominous atmosphere of 'dragon's egg' bunker .

"The Justice Department will sue the state of North Carolina for alleged racial discrimination over tough new voting rules. This is the latest effort by the Obama administration to fight back against a Supreme Court decision that struck down the most powerful part of the landmark Voting Rights Act and freed southern states from strict federal oversight of their elections. North Carolina has a new law scaling back the period for early voting and imposing stringent voter identification requirements. It is among at least five Southern states adopting stricter voter ID and other election laws. Diminishing voting rights: North Carolina and other southern states have enacted tougher new laws minorities feel target them, these protesters picketed in June against a similar law in Alabama . The Justice Department on Aug. 22 sued Texas over the state's voter ID law and is seeking to intervene in a lawsuit over redistricting laws in Texas that minority groups consider to be discriminatory. Republican lawmakers in southern states insist the new measures are needed to prevent voter fraud, though such crimes are infrequent. Democrats and civil rights groups argue the tough new laws are intended to make voting more difficult for minorities and students, voting groups that lean toward Democrats, in states with legacies of poll taxes and literacy tests. Attorney General Eric Holder is expected to announce the lawsuit against North Carolina at a news conference Monday, according to a person who has been briefed on the department's plans but is not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and spoke only on condition of anonymity. We're comin' for you: Attorney General Eric Holder and the Justice Department are suing southern states over their more stringent voter laws . Holder will be joined at the news conference by the acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil rights division, Joceyln Samuels, and the three U.S. attorneys from North Carolina, the person said. In the North Carolina lawsuit, the person said, the government will challenge requirements in state law that eliminate the first seven days of early voting opportunities and eliminate same-day voter registration during the early voting period. Same-day registration allows voters to cast a ballot immediately after presenting elections officials with proof of their name and home address. The Justice Department challenge also is aimed at a provision eliminating the counting of certain types of provisional ballots by voters who cast ballots in their home counties but do not vote in the correct precincts. To the rescue: The Obama Administration is spearheading the fight to defend minorities' voting rights . Finally, the federal government will challenge a provision in the new law that requires voters to present government-issued identification at the polls in order to cast ballots. In North Carolina, a recent state board of elections survey found that hundreds of thousands of registered voters did not have a state-issued ID. Many of those voters are young, black, poor or elderly. In remarks Sept. 20 to the Congressional Black Caucus, Holder said the Justice Department will not allow the Supreme Court's action to be interpreted as ""open season"" for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights. The Justice Department will ask a federal judge to place the four provisions in North Carolina's new law under federal scrutiny for an indeterminate period - a process known as pre-clearance. However, the provision of the Voting Rights Act that the Justice Department is invoking may be a difficult tool for the Obama administration to use. Protect their vote: More protesters from earlier this year in Alabama, picketing outside the Supreme Court to defend the Voting Rights Act . A handful of jurisdictions have been subjected to pre-clearance, or advance approval, of election changes through the Civil Rights Act provision it is relying on, but a court first must find that a state or local government engaged in intentional discrimination under the Constitution's 14th or 15th amendments, or the jurisdiction has to admit to discrimination. Unlike other parts of the voting law, the discriminatory effect of an action is not enough to trigger court review. Nowhere is the debate over voting rights is more heated than in Florida, where the chaotic recount in the disputed 2000 presidential race took place. Florida election officials are set to resume an effort to remove non-citizens from the state's voting rolls. A purge last year ended in embarrassment after hundreds of American citizens, most of whom were black or Hispanic, were asked to prove their citizenship or risk losing their right to vote.","North Carolina enacted more stringent voter ID laws after a recent Supreme Court decision .

"Michael Brown Sr said on Wednesday that the grand jury's decision not to indict white cop Darren Wilson for the fatal shooting of his son, an unarmed black teenager, reinforced to him that he was living in a 'racist state'. Michael Brown's father and mother, Lesley McSpadden, reacted with fury to Officer Darren Wilson's first interview on Wednesday, saying: 'I don't think he wanted to kill my son but he wanted kill someone.' Mr Brown Sr told Reverend Al Sharpton that he also believed St Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch 'crucified' his 18-year-old son's character. The parents attended the National Action Network's House Of Justice in Harlem, New York on Wednesday afternoon where they prayed with Sharpton; the family of Eric Garner, a father-of-six who died in police custody in New York this summer; and the partner of Akai Gurley, the Brooklyn man a police officer shot and killed last week.

Lesley McSpadden (left), the mother of Michael Brown, sobs at a prayer vigil in New York on Wednesday alongside relatives of other victims of police shootings including Esaw Garner, wife of Eric Garner . Reverend Sharpton said at the Wednesday press conference: 'As you see, they share each other's pain.' He added: ''These families didn't choose to be public figures... they have been thrown into a painful spotlight.' Mr Brown Sr said earlier that the grand jury's decision 'just let me know that where we live is not what we thought, or what I thought. 'It's what people have been saying all the time, for a nice little minute: that this was a racist state.' The teenager's parents had earlier spoken to CBS, alongside their lawyer Benjamin Crump, a day after Wilson said he was only doing his job on the day he killed the unarmed teen and that now, he wanted to get on with a 'normal life'. Ms McSpadden said: 'He [Wilson] says that his conscience is clear. How can your conscience be clear after killing somebody even after it was accidental death?' Ferguson cop Darren Wilson has said that he has a clear conscience after he shot dead teenager Michael Brown because he was doing his job as a police officer . The grieving mother broke down when she said that she couldn't even donate Michael's organs following his death. Officer Wilson has maintained that he made the right choice to use lethal force in the fight in broad daylight on August 9 - and would do it all over again because Brown went for his gun and he feared he would be killed. However Ms McSpadden said on Wednesday: 'I don't believe a word of it. I know my son too well, he wouldn't provoke anyone like that.' She also denounced the violence on the streets of Ferguson following the grand jury announcement  on Monday that Wilson would not be indicted for Brown's death. 'We continue to ask for calm and protest with them in a peaceful manner,' Ms McSpadden said.'We can't be held accountable for others' actions.' Ms McSpadden's call for peace came two days after she appeared at a protest in Ferguson.  Although she wore sunglasses, her anger and devastation were clear as tears ran down her face. 'Everybody wants me to be calm. You know what them bullets did to my son!' she sobbed. Her husband, Louis Head, has drawn criticism after he appeared to incense the crowd, by screaming: 'Burn this b**** down'. On Tuesday, dozens of cities across the U.S. held demonstrations about the cop killing of Michael Brown. Michael Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr, appeared on CBS on Wednesday where they said they ' don't believe a word' of Darren Wilson's account of shooting dead their teenage son . In Ferguson, authorities made 58 arrests overnight on Tuesday as violence once again broke out on the streets. Among those arrested were 28 people from out of state and included seven felony charges. Michael Brown Sr said that he wanted something good to emerge from his son's tragic death. 'We want change,' he said. 'We don't accept our son is gone, but we're dealing with it. We want change all over.' The parents earlier said that Wilson's decision to conduct an exclusive interview with GMA anchor George Stephanopoulos, added 'insult to injury'. Wilson used the interview to walk step-by-step through his actions on the day that Brown died. In the spotlight: Ferguson cop Darren Wilson (pictured right) was interviewed this week following the grand jury decision that he would not be indicted for the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown (left) While he feels remorse for Brown’s death, Wilson maintained that he made the right choice to use lethal force in the fight and would do it all over again. 'I don’t think it’s haunting; it’s always going to be something that happened,' Wilson said. ‘The reason I have a clear conscience is because I know I did my job right.' The officer said that he loved his job on the Ferguson force but refused to say whether a decision had been made on whether he would return. Wilson also confirmed on Wednesday that he had recently gotten married and his wife was pregnant, adding that the couple 'just want to live a normal life'. However, Wilson conceded that there would be 'a new normal' for him. Wilson said that 'stressful was an understatement' to describe his life following the Michael Brown shooting. 'You are always looking to see if someone is following you or has noticed you,' Wilson said. 'I grew a beard, it was uncomfortable but it helped. You take precautions - where you sit in a restaurant, where you drive.' The shooting death of Michael Brown, and the subsequent failure of the grand jury to indict Wilson over the killing, has led to violent protests in Ferguson this week while mass demonstrations has swept through more than 170 U.S. cities.

"Paul McGrath always felt Roy Keane was in danger of becoming over-stretched by working for both the FAI, and for Aston Villa. ‘With the two jobs, there was no rest for him,’ said the former Villa and Irish defender yesterday. ‘He was trying to make sure Ireland get to the Euros and then going back to Villa and doing his best for them. Paul McGrath said Roy Keane was always going to find it difficult balancing two different jobs . ‘Ireland is a big job because you have to go around looking at players and seeing who is available, even under the grandparent rule. He has to go and watch players. ‘To add on the Villa job was a big ask. It seems now that it was too much for Roy. He’s realised he can’t do both. I’m glad he’s stuck with Ireland,’ he added. Asked if Keane might come to regret his decision, McGrath said, ‘Yeah, I think he might. But Roy will feel he’s done the right thing. ‘He can concentrate on Ireland. That was the job he had first.’ McGrath, who played in the ’94 World Cup finals with Keane, was astonished by the timing of the resignation, and believes Villa boss Paul Lambert was caught unawares too. ‘I was shocked when I heard that news this morning because Villa are in a tough spot at the moment so to get another shock like that will surprise Villa fans. The former Manchester United captain was assistant manager for both Ireland and Aston Villa . ‘I think it will have caught out the Villa staff, especially Paul Lambert, as it’s another big hurdle to be gotten over. ‘While I’m disappointed Roy has left, I’m still hopeful that we can dig our way out of trouble.’ Villa play at Burnley on Saturday, aware that a loss could drop the club into the relegation zone. ‘It’s a massive game for us because we’ve stopped the rot by drawing the last two games. ‘Now we’ve got to beat Burnley to move away from the bottom,’ said McGrath. Former midfielder Ian Taylor, who played with McGrath in the Villa team which won the 1996 League Cup, feels there’s more to the story than meets the eye. ‘It is a bit strange. You just wonder about the reasons why,’ said the Villa club ambassador. ‘I think he’s said that because of the two roles, that he can’t do both. But I tend to think it might be a little bit more than that, although you have to go with what he (Keane) says. ‘Why not wait until after tomorrow and Tuesday as well, because they’re two big games for us. So it’s really bad timing.’ McGrath said he felt Villa boss Paul Lambert will have been shocked by Keane's sudden departure . Taylor feels the Villa fans will miss Keane more than anyone. ‘They were always chanting his name, they loved his attitude; he was always up in the fourth official’s face. They had taken to him, probably a little bit more than the manager, to be honest,’ he said. ‘The fourth officials must have been fearful of Villa games because he (Keane) was always combative.’ ‘I bumped into him a few weeks ago at the team hotel and had a good conversation with him about things. ‘He was saying “what is the fuss about, we’ve got good players at the football club and it’s only a matter of time before we turn things around.”’ Striker Darren Bent (below), who left Villa yesterday to go on loan at Brighton, paid tribute to the former Villa assistant manager. ‘Roy was fantastic for me. He would tell it as it is. ‘If you want to get better as a player you need people like him to tell you the truth. ‘I got on well with him and it’s a sorry loss for the club.’","Roy Keane has resigned from his position at Aston Villa .

"Lives are being lost to terrorists because Edward Snowden hampered security service operations, according to terror experts. Lord West, a former admiral who served as UK security minister until 2010, warned that extremists changed their tactics after the US fugitive leaked details of intelligence agency operations – with fatal results. Raymond Kelly, a former New York Police Department commissioner, also said that leaks from Snowden had caused huge damage. ‘People that I know, certainly in the US government, say that this is the worst leak that they are aware of,’ he said. ‘The damage is significant and ongoing and you can see it has also damaged relations between the US and other countries. Scroll down for video . Exile: Lives are being lost to terrorists because Edward Snowden's leaks hampered security service operations, according to terror experts . ‘We see major corporations having difficulty doing business outside the US and, as a result, putting impenetrable encryption in their products which ultimately hurts the whole law enforcement effort.’ Lord West said the Government must reintroduce the Communications Data Bill, which is dubbed a ‘snoopers’ charter’ by opponents. The proposed legislation would make internet companies keep records of every website their customers visited. Lord West, a former admiral who served as UK security minister until 2010, warned that extremists changed their tactics after the US fugitive leaked details of intelligence agency operations . Snowden, 31, became one of the world’s most wanted men in June last year – less than a month after Lee Rigby’s murder – when he broke cover as the civilian CIA worker who stole classified documents from the US National Security Agency. He leaked information about attempts by spying agencies – including GCHQ and the NSA – to view citizens’ private information. He claimed that internet history, emails, text messages, calls and passwords were harvested. Lord West, a former first sea lord, said: ‘Since the revelations of the traitor Snowden, terrorist groups – in particular Isil (Islamic State) – have changed their methods of communications and shifted to other ways of talking to each other. ‘Consequently there are people dying who actually would now be alive. ‘It is now critical that we move forward the Communications Data Bill that was paused so unreasonably because there is a very real danger that unless we do this, I think it is not exaggerating to say that people will die in this country who would have been safe if that had been in place.’ Baroness Stowell, the Leader of the House of Lords, said: ‘The leaking by Snowden and the reporting of his leaks have had a serious effect on intelligence gathering – that is unquestionable.’ MI5, MI6 and GCHQ chiefs insist they urgently need extended powers to track down terrorists but the Liberal Democrats claim the bill is ‘dead and buried’ because it is a breach of civil liberties. Snowden, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in US history. The defence contractor claims he had to act because the US government’s policies were a ‘threat to democracy’. He fled to Hong Kong, then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location.","Former admiral said terrorists had learned from Snowden's revelations .

"An eyewitness who saw the killing of Michael Brown at the hands of officer Darren Wilson has revealed his version of events leading up to the fatal shooting. The man, whose name has been withheld, from St. Louis, Missouri, says that the teenager did not have his hands above his head when Wilson shot at him, but rather 'out to his sides.' He also said Brown 'staggered toward Wilson despite commands to stop' and that 'the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired.' Scroll down for video . Eyewitness account: A man who saw the shooting of Michael Brown (above) says that the teen had his 'hands to the side' and was approaching a police officer when he was shot . Excessive force: Despite the fact that Brown was approaching officer Darren Wilson (above) and did not have his hands fully raised, the witness calls the shooting 'outright murder' The man, who is African American, also testified to this account in front of the grand jury considering whether or not to indict Wilson on murder charges. And while he would not detail exactly what he told the grand jury when speaking with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, he did say the that the 'members seemed fair and asked a lot of questions.' Another critical piece the man shared was that the officer did not fire until Brown turned back toward him. He says that Brown and his friend were walking down the middle of the street when Wilson pulled up to them and they exchanged some words, which he could not hear. Wilson then pulled up in front of the boys and then backed up his car, when a 'tussle' occurred on the passenger side which the witness could not see. Then a shot was fired - he does not say whether or not is was intentional - and he saw Brown run down the street, followed by Wilson, who was yelling at the 18-year-old to 'Stop!' The young man Brown was with, Dorian Johnson, ran the other way according to the witness. Then, after being told to stop a few more times, Brown turned around and took a step towards Wilson. Slogan: Some have claimed Brown said to the officer, 'Hands up don't shoot,' which has led many protestors to use that as their chant (above) Coming out: There have been numerous rallies in the St. Louis area since the August 9 shooting . 'When he stepped foot on that street, the officer told him to stop again, and he fired three shots,' said the witness. 'When he got hit, he staggered like, ""Oh,"" and his body moved. Then he looked down.' He added, 'His hands were up like this (he gestures with arms out to the side and palms upward), and he was looking at the officer and was coming toward him trying to keep his feet and stand up. The officer took a few steps back and yelled, ""Stop,"" again, and Michael was trying to stay on his feet.' At this point he says Brown was 20 to 25 feet away and staggering. 'As he was firing those last rounds, Michael was on his way down. We were thinking, ""Oh my God, oh my God, brother, stop, stop."" He was already on his way down when he fired those last shots.' The witness also said Wilson didn’t have to kill Brown. 'It went from zero to 100 like that, in the blink of an eye. ... What transpired to us, in my eyesight, was murder. Down outright murder.' People claiming to have witnessed the August 9 shooting of Brown have given wildly different accounts of what happened, with some saying the young man had his arms raised over his head and that Wilson shot him while his back was turned and he was running, and the police saying the unarmed teen physically assaulted the officer and tried to get his gun.","A witness who testified in front of the grand jury about the shooting of teenager Michael Brown says the teen was approaching officer when shot .

"Aston Villa's season has been plunged into deep uncertainty after Roy Keane quit as Paul Lambert’s assistant. Keane left the club with immediate effect on Friday just five months after taking up the role as Lambert’s right-hand man, citing an inability to perform his duties alongside those of being Martin O’Neill’s No 2 with Republic of Ireland. The timing of Keane’s departure raised questions and sparked shock among the Villa squad, however. It came on the eve of a crucial Premier League match at Burnley and just hours after he took training at Bodymoor Heath. Ireland do not have another match until March. Roy Keane had joined Paul Lambert as assistant manager at Aston Villa in July, but quit after just six months . Keane was still taking training on Thursday ahead of the shock announcement on Friday morning . IRELAND - 2002 . Walks out of the World Cup, telling boss Mick McCarthy: ‘I didn’t rate you as a player, I don’t rate you as a manager, and I don’t rate you as a person.’ MAN UTD - 2005 . Criticises team-mates on MUTV before telling Sir Alex Ferguson: ‘We need f***ing more from you.’ SUNDERLAND - 2008 . After he resigns, his players allegedly celebrate his departure. IPSWICH - 2011 . Promises Premier League promotion but is sacked when he fails to deliver. But it is understood Keane had become increasingly disillusioned with working at Villa in recent weeks and continued for as long as he felt able. There are believed to have been clashes with players over training intensity — Keane’s high standards are well-known — and he has notably been more withdrawn during matches. There was also understood to be a growing dislike for his journey from his Cheshire home to Bodymoor Heath each day, a trip that takes one hour, 45 minutes. O’Neill admitted last night he had spoken to Keane about Villa at their recent international get-together, and that a desire for more time with his wife and children also played a part. ‘Roy being the perfectionist that he is, he wanted to give everything to every single cause. But I think family time, at the minute, that’s something that was missing,’ said the former Villa manager. Keane’s departure at this stage in the season places huge strain on Lambert, however. Villa have lost six of their last eight Premier League games and only scored six times all season — leaving them two points above the relegation zone. Steve Clarke, the former West Bromwich Albion head coach, has emerged as a potential successor to Keane, but the Villa manager had further words to worry supporters over Fabian Delph. Keane has left Villa to focus on his role as Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill's assistant . The Irish assistant looks pensive on the bench alongside Lambert before the Southampton clash . Keane, seen in training on Thursday, said he did not feel it was fair to either employer to keep doing both jobs . Lambert revealed the England midfielder might be sold when the winter window opens as he shows little inclination to sign a new contract. Delph, currently out with a shoulder injury, is a free agent in the summer but is attracting interest from Liverpool and Tottenham and Lambert may decide to cash in before he is able to leave for nothing. Lambert said. ‘You are never sure what can happen. With the Bosman ruling the player holds the cards. I know that because I’ve done it myself.’ With Ron Vlaar likely to move clubs in January, Villa fans hope Keane is the only other figure to leave. His sudden departure, which echoes that of the 2002 World Cup with Ireland, is a ‘sorry loss’, according to Darren Bent. Aston Villa won three of their first four league games with Keane at the club, but haven't won any since . Keane has been in his role with Ireland for a year, and took the Villa job in July on top of that . The striker has signed on loan for Brighton and said: ‘What people most respected about him was that he would tell you how it was. I can’t speak highly enough of him.’ In a statement, Keane said: ‘Ultimately, my roles with Villa and Ireland and combining my commitment to these have become too much. It isn’t fair to either Villa or Ireland, so I’ve made this decision.’ However, Villa and Ireland legend Paul McGrath told Ireland’s RTE Radio 1: ‘I was shocked when I heard that news because Villa are in a tough spot at the moment. ‘It’s not a good time for Roy to be leaving.’ Lambert added: ‘Roy informed me that, ultimately, the difficulty of combining both roles has prompted his decision, which I respect totally.’","Roy Keane steps down from Aston Villa role to focus on Republic of Ireland .

"Despite its unlikely birthplace,  Yamazaki's Single Malt Sherry Cask 2013 has trumped more than 1,000 challengers to be named the world's best whisky by prominent critic Jim Murray in his Whisky Bible 2015, who referred to the amber nectar as 'near indescribable genius.' He said the whisky had a 'nose of exquisite boldness' and a finish of 'light, teasing spice', and scored it an impressive 97.5 marks out of 100. The first Japanese whisky to claim the crown owes its success to adroit exploitation of climate and water, special casks and a keen awareness of the Japanese palate, the company says. Visitors take pictures in the garden of Suntory Holdings' Yamazaki Distillery in Shimamoto town, Osaka prefecture, near Kyoto, Japan .

Suntory's chief blender Shinji Fukuyo (right) samples whisky during a presentation . Nestled at the foot of wooded hills near the ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto, the whisky distillery feels a long way from the northerly glens of Scotch's spiritual home. In Yamazaki's cavernous cellar, 2,000 barrels emit a heady scent as the whiskies mature, the casks breathing as the seasons change to produce the 'genius' flavour. 'Hot summers make for a complex, deep aroma,' said Scotland-trained Shinji Fukuyo, chief blender at Beam Suntory, which owns Yamazaki. Taken from the wells of a nearby town, the distillery's water is prized for its mineral content and softness, while maturation occurs in hard-to-come-by sherry casks, specially crafted from oak in northern Spain. The popularity of whisky in Japan has ebbed and flowed since Masataka Taketsuru, the son of a sake brewer, returned from Scotland in 1918, establishing the country's first distillery at Yamazaki five years later. As the good times rolled in Japan's 1980s bubble-era, Scotch mixed with water became an indispensable part of business culture. Senior General Manager of the distillery Takahisa Fujii poses in Yamazaki's cavernous cellar where 2,000 barrels of whiskies mature . But sales slumped as the economy flopped in the 1990s, with drinkers opting for beer and clear spirits. Since the turn of the century, demand has recovered on the back of a newfound taste for highballs and growing international praise for Japanese whisky. Highlighting whisky's increased profile in Japan, public broadcaster NHK is showing a television drama inspired by Taketsuru and his Scottish wife. At a dimly lit bar in Tokyo's upmarket Ginza district, drinkers, tippling as jazz tinkles in the background, are proud of Japan's moment in the world whisky spotlight. 'There are so many famous whiskies, so for a Japanese one to become well-known, I'm very happy,' said nutritionist Miki Asakawa.

"A sculpture that is part of the Elgin Marbles has been unveiled in Russia, after a secret deal with the British Museum, in a move that has infuriated Greece. The headless statue of Greek river-god Ilissos went on display today at the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg as part of its 250th anniversary celebrations. But the move has prompted a furious diplomatic row with Greece, as the British Museum allowed one of the classical marble sculptures leave the UK for the first time - in a shroud of secrecy. Scroll down for video . A sculpture of the Greek river god Ilissos, part of the Elgin marbles, has been unveiled in St. Petersburg . Director of the British Museum Neil MacGregor (centre, right) and Mikhail Piotrovsky, director of Hermitage Museum (centre, left) gaze upon the statue . The Prime Minister of Greece has once again accusing Britain of 'looting'. Antonis Samaras said the decision by the British Museum to lend the statue of Illissos to Russia  'provokes the Greek people,' and added that 'the Parthenon and its sculptures were the subject of looting.' The statue's unexpected move from the British Museum came after a journey cloaked in secrecy for security and to ensure maximum impact. The loan comes despite worsening relations between Russia and the West over its actions in Ukraine. The freezing political climate, which has been dubbed 'the new Cold War', may warm up a little with the loan of the Elgin Marble. Last night, British Museum director Neil MacGregor told The Times: 'The more chilly the politics between governments the more important the relationship between museums. 'From its beginning 250 years ago, the point of the British Museum was gathering together objects in one place to tell narratives about the world.

Nothing to see here: School children look at an empty plinth of the Ilissos statue part of collection of The Parthenon Marbles, also known as the Elgin Marbles in the British Museum in London today . Secret action: The statue's unexpected move from the British Museum came after a journey cloaked in secrecy for security and to ensure maximum impact . Explanation: Chairman of The Trustees of the British Museum Sir Richard Lambert defended the decision to lend one of the Elgin Marbles to Russia . 'When the Parthenon Sculptures came to London it was the first time that they could be seen at eye-level. 'They stopped being architectural details in the Parthenon and became sculptures in their own right. 'They became part of a different story — of what the human body has meant in world culture. In Athens they would be part of an exclusively Athenian story.' Sir Richard said the loan, which was only finally approved 15 days ago, adding that they wanted to 'leave room for flexibility if the political relationship between Europe and Russia changed.' The move is likely to reignite the Greek government's 40-year claim to the 2,500-year-old sculptures, which were removed from the Parthenon in Athens by Lord Elgin in the 19th century. In October, lawyer Amal Clooney – the wife of actor George Clooney – said Greece had 'just cause' for the return of the marbles. Mrs Clooney, who is part of the legal team advising the Greek government on possible action in the international courts to force the return of the marbles, claimed Britain should be embarrassed for retaining them. Defending: Earlier this year lawyer Amal Clooney – the wife of actor George Clooney – said Greece had 'just cause' for the return of the marbles . Mrs Clooney, pictured touring the Acropolis Museum, is part of the legal team advising the Greek government on possible action to force the marbles' return . However, Mr MacGregor ruled out a return, arguing last month that they gave 'maximum public benefit' by staying in London. The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce, had the Parthenon Marble sculptures removed while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803. In 1801, the Earl claimed to have obtained a permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Parthenon and his agents took half of the surviving sculptures and had them shipped to Britain. In Greece, however, the Scottish aristocrat was accused of looting. The marbles were bought by the British government to be displayed in the British Museum. The Elgin Marbles are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions and architectural members that were mostly created by Phidias and his assistants.

On display: The Elgin Marbles (pictured at the British Museum) are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions and architectural members that were created by Phidias and his assistants . As the Acropolis was still an Ottoman military fort, Elgin required permission to enter the site. His agents subsequently removed half of the surviving sculptures, as well as architectural members and sculpture from the Propylaea and Erechtheum. Earl: The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce (pictured), removed the Parthenon Marble pieces from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire . The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost of around £70,000. The scupltures were shipped to Britain, but in Greece, the Scots aristocrat was accused of looting and vandalism. They were bought by the British Government in 1816 and placed in the British Museum. They still stand on view in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery. Greece has sought their return from the British Museum through the years, to no avail. In February, while attending the Berlin Film Festival to promote The Monuments Men, George Clooney was asked by a Greek journalist whether Britain should allow Greece to reclaim its historic art. He replied: 'You have a very good case. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing if they were returned. That is a good idea, a fair thing to do.' Amal Alamuddin Clooney's law firm Doughty Street chambers yesterday confirmed that she had travelled to Athens, where she will remain until Thursday, at the invitation of the Greek government. Her visit is 'in connection with the Parthenon sculptures that are presently on display in the British museum', it said. The authenticity of Elgin's permit to remove the sculptures from the Parthenon has been widely disputed, especially as the original document has been lost. Many claim it was not legal. However, others argue that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognizable.","One of the Elgin Marbles will be displayed in St Petersburg from today .

"Incarcerated Australian journalist Peter Greste, who has been locked up in an Egyptian jail for 327 days, could be pardoned by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The parents of Mr Greste have new hope that intervention by the  president could see their son home for Christmas. But the hope of Lois and Juris Greste is tempered by the frustrations experienced over the past 11 months. 'We have had very promising indications before that Peter will be back home with his family very, very soon,' Juris Greste told reporters in Brisbane on Friday. Scroll down for video . Journalist Peter Greste has been held in an Egyptian jail for 327 days . 'We just have to remain patient and hope for the best.' The Egyptian president said on Friday that the possibility of releasing three jailed Al-Jazeera journalists was being considered. 'This issue is under study,' he told France 24. Asked if they will be pardoned soon, he said: 'If we find that this is appropriate for Egyptian national security, then we will do it.' Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi spoke to France 24 on Friday about a possible pardon . Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the ABC that Sisi's comments are a welcome step forward. 'If there are indications from the Egyptian president that he will do that [consider a pardon] prior to the hearing of the appeal then we would welcome that,' she said. Mr Greste is being held along with Canadian-Egyptian national Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohamed, all from the Qatar-based television network Al Jazeera. They were detained in December and convicted six months later in June of spreading lies to help a 'terrorist organisation'. Al Jazeera said the accusations against the three journalists are absurd.

On Thursday a spokesman for the TV network told the ABC: 'The Egyptian authorities have it in their power to release our journalists. 'World opinion expects this to happen speedily, and for all three to be freed.' Sisi issued a decree last week allowing him to repatriate foreign prisoners when it was in his country's 'supreme interests'. Greste's boss, Al Jazeera English chief Al Anstey, called it another part of the confusing and unfair process. 'It defies logic, it defies justice they're still behind bars,' 9 News reported. Western governments and human rights groups have condemned the case, with the United Nations questioning Egypt's reputation and the independence of its judiciary. The three journalists are appealing the convictions on the grounds of flawed evidence. Lois (left) and Juris Greste, parents of Australian journalists Peter Greste, spoke at a press conference in Brisbane on Friday . Peter Greste's parents say news their son may receive a pardon from the Egyptian president has been the most promising development since he was arrested . Greste's parents Lois and Juris said they would be visiting Egypt around Peter's birthday on December 1 . 'They had videos from other news organisations, family photos, they had the Gotye music video. It was totally irrelevant to the case,' Anstey said. The trio will have been behind bars for more than a year when they next appear in court on January 1 to decide if their appeal will go ahead. Sisi said in July that he wished the imprisoned Al Jazeera journalists had been deported and not put on trial. Anstey, who was in Sydney last week to meet with Greste's family and campaign for his release, is concerned about the prisoners' appalling confinement. 'They're living a nightmare every second of every day. They've got to be set free,' he said, 9News reported.

"Manchester United may find themselves sixth in the Barclays Premier League - with just three wins to their credit from eight matches - but Louis van Gaal was still unbowed. The 10-point gap to leaders Chelsea, whom they face on Sunday, poses no problem in the Dutchman's mind. United, he proclaimed after the 2-2 draw at West Bromwich, can still win the title. 'Call me arrogant but we can still catch Chelsea. I have done it before,' he said after Daley Blind rescued United a point at The Hawthorns. Leaving the arrogance aside, Van Gaal is right - he has done it before. He has even endured worse starts and gone on to win the league. Louis van Gaal is still confident Manchester United can win the Premier League title, despite a 10-point gap to Chelsea following their 2-2 draw at West Brom on Monday night . Daley Blind fired home United's equaliser at West Brom with just three minutes remaining . The result leaves United sixth in the table ahead of Sunday's showdown with Chelsea . The Dutchman is a notoriously slow starter in new jobs and new seasons. What we saw at Ajax, Barcelona, AZ Alkmaar and Bayern Munich, we are currently seeing at United. Let's consider United's position at present. The optimism of an unbeaten pre-season soon faded when Swansea City won at Old Trafford on the opening day. They laboured to disappointing draws at Sunderland and then Burnley, either side of a humiliating 4-0 defeat to MK Dons in the Capital One Cup. Van Gaal finally enjoyed his first competitive win when Queens Park Rangers were thrashed 4-0 but they were then stunned by Leicester. Back-to-back home wins over West Ham and Everton saw United climb into the Champions League places prior to Monday night's late rescue mission in the Black Country.

October 26 - Chelsea (H) November 2 - Manchester City (A) November 8 - Crystal Palace (H) November 22 - Arsenal (A) November 29 - Hull City (H) December 2 - Stoke City (H) Much has been said and written about the clear disparities between United's attack and defence - the latter left horrendously exposed as Chris Brunt played in Saido Berahino for the Baggies' second goal. But United fans can take some comfort from events during Van Gaal's first season at Bayern Munich in 2009, when a nightmare start very nearly ended in a Treble triumph. They started with back-to-back draws against Hoffenheim and Werder Bremen before slumping to defeat at Mainz. Eight games in, the same stage United are at now, they sat seventh in the Bundesliga but had an identical record of wins, draws and losses. By the end of November they had won just five of 13 matches and had slumped to eighth. Allied to this was a dreadful start to their Champions League campaign, with home and away defeats by Bordeaux leaving them staring at an early exit and Van Gaal fighting for his job. He responded in typically ebullient fashion ahead of a trip to Freiburg in late October. Repeatedly describing himself as a 'Prozesstrainer' ('Process manager'), Van Gaal laid down the law: 'I am at Bayern Munich, either you give me time or you don't.' As speculation mounted that Van Gaal would be ousted before the winter break, he raised the stakes: 'If I was gone now, whom would Bayern sign? [Sir Alex] Ferguson? [Fabio] Capello? 'They might be more successful, but they are unavailable.' Repeat: Van Gaal's AZ Alkmaar also started slowly in 2008-2009 but they went on to claim the title . Dwarfed: It took Van Gaal some time to convince the fans at Barcelona that he was the right man for the job . Protest: Fans at the Nou Camp called for Van Gaal to be dismissed as results didn't go their way . FIRST EIGHT LEAGUE GAMES . Hoffenheim (A) 1-1 . Werder Bremen (H) 1-1 . Mainz (A) 1-2 .

United are out of the League Cup and currently trail Chelsea by 10 points in the league. The FA Cup campaign starts in January. Bayern won 2-1 at Freiburg and remained unbeaten until late March, hitting the summit of the table just after the winter break. In the Champions League, Bayern had to win their final group game away at Juventus in order to reach the knockout stage and they were a goal down after half-an-hour. Then, Ivica Olic was brought down for a penalty - the first Bayern had been awarded all season. As the outfield players glanced at each other, it was the goalkeeper Hans-Jorg Butt who had the bottle to step up and put the ball past Gianluigi Buffon. In the second-half, everything finally came together. Bayern outplayed Juventus to win 4-1 and never looked back. They won the title by five points and recovered from their shaky start to reach the final of the Champions League, where his old understudy, Jose Mourinho, triumphed with Inter Milan. Van Gaal was vindicated, his 'process', once seen through to its end, was a successful one. Upset: Van Gaal did not make himself popular by trying to move Barcelona hero Rivaldo . Making his case: Van Gaal presents the Barcelona squad during his second spell in charge . When he guided unfashionable Alkmaar to the Eredivisie title in 2009, the season started with back-to-back defeats by NAC Breda and ADO Den Haag. They promptly went 28 matches unbeaten and won the league by 11 points. At Barcelona, he dismayed pretty much everyone at the club by trying to enforce his philosophy, which was completely different to the club's. Van Gaal asked star man Rivaldo to play on the left wing rather than through the middle, leading to rows in the camp and the fans getting on his back. At the end of his first season, many remained unhappy, as Jimmy Burns recorded in his book, Barca: A People's Passion: 'The jury is out on Van Gaal, a Dutchman lacking the humanity of Bobby Robson and the popularity of Johan Cruyff, both of whose heads have rolled in the space of less than two years. 'Barca may be at the top of the league, but the fans are unconvinced. They have watched the team pathetically founder in Europe, while continuing to play lacklustre football in the League, winning seemingly by default rather than design.' Vindicated: Van Gaal struggled initially at Ajax but he eventually delivered the European Cup . But you couldn't argue with the results - well, eventually. The following year, Barca found themselves 10th in La Liga in early December and at one stage they lost four on the bounce. When things finally clicked, Barcelona won 19 of their next 24 games, winning the title by a commanding 11-point margin. It all came right in the end. And this pattern dates right back to the beginning of his managerial career, when he was named manager of Ajax against all the odds back in 1991. Though a managerial novice, Van Gaal was a disciplinarian and his methods certainly ruffled a few feathers. He fell out with leading players Jan Wouters, Bryan Roy and Johnny van't Schip by tinkering with their positions on the field. And when Ajax took just 20 points from their first 16 games, Van Gaal had to endure the fans calling for club legend Johan Cruyff to replace him. 'I will not change my attitude,' Van Gaal said. He didn't, and his time in Amsterdam yielded three Dutch league titles, the UEFA Cup and the Champions League in 1995. So history tells us that things will come right for Van Gaal in the end. Now comes an acid test - United play Chelsea and Manchester City in the next fortnight, the first real test of their vulnerable backline .

"The parents of 43 students who went missing in Mexico after being attacked by police 'need protection' from enraged campaigners trying to demonise their children, the UN has said. The group of trainee teachers vanished ten weeks ago in Iguala after being detained by local police and, critics say, thrust into the hands of a criminal gang. Since their disappearance hundreds have marched across the south American country calling for authorities to bring them back alive and establish how they came to be abducted. Scroll down for videos . Parents of missing students 'need protection' from online campaigners 'trying to vilify' their sons, the UN said . In recent weeks however a campaign has been launched to suggest that the students, all enrolled at a rural teacher's college in the southern state of Guerrero, had a hand in sinister criminal activity. Yesterday the UN Human Rights High Commission said the youngsters' parents were in danger in light of critics' demonstrations. 'Some are starting to vilify and insult the disappeared students and demonise their parents and their demands,' Javier Hernandez, the Commision's representative in Mexico told the Guardian. 'The vast wave of protest generated by the case of the 43 students needs to be protected.' Protests have been widespread across the country since the students' disappearance more than two months ago. No traces of the men's bodies have been found after investigators ruled out a mass grave in the state where they were last seen as a possible burial site. Victims: The above poster shows the 43 missing students and offers a reward for their recovery more than ten weeks after the trainee teachers vanished after being taken into police custody . Demonstrators take part in a protest in Guadalajara city demanding justice in the case of the 43 students that went missing in Iguala, Guerrero state, last September 26 . A drug gang has confessed to killing the group, claiming the students were handed over to them by local policemen in Iguala following clashes on September 26. Prosecutors have not confirmed this as true, with the victims' families awaiting DNA results from charred corpses which have been sent to an Austrian university. The case has put a spotlight on Mexico's struggle to end corruption and impunity amid a drug war that has left 100,000 people dead or missing since 2006.","Parents of missing men are 'at risk',said UN Human Rights Commission .

"A former Army Lance Corporal and his wife who pretended a freak bicycle accident had blinded their seven-year-old son to swindle £70,000 in insurance cash have been jailed. Jeremy and Sally Anne Jones forged medical documents showing their son had suffered irreversible eye damage in the horror smash and used the money to buy a sports car. They were both found guilt of one count of fraud by false representation and two counts of forgery and sentenced to a year in jail each. The couple, both aged 38, were caught out by fraud investigators when they tried the same trick again - this time claiming that Mrs Jones had been partially deafened when their car backfired. Former Army Lance Corporal Jeremy, left, and his estranged wife Sally, right, were jailed for a year each at Salisbury Crown Court after swindling £70,000 in an insurance scam . A judge at Salisbury Crown Court heard today how the couple dreamed up the scam after their son fell off his bike near the Army base where they lived and was rushed to hospital suffering from head injuries. The court heard their vulnerable son - who suffers from Asperger Syndrome, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - was probably not aware of the scam his parents were playing out. They later submitted a claim to their insurer, AIG, saying the optical nerve in the youngster's left eye had been severed in the accident, leaving him permanently blinded. The couple faked a letter from a real-life respected ophthalmologist, stating that their son's reported blindness was untreatable, which they faxed to AIG, the court heard. The insurance company then paid out a lump sum of £70,000 into their bank accounts two month later. Sadio Rizzo, prosecuting, said the document was a 'complete forgery in every way.' Jones, from West Bromwich, stood stiffly in the dock with his hands behind his back. His estranged wife, whose address was withheld by the court, did not acknowledge him as she entered the courtroom. The court heard she was convicted in 1996 for falsely claiming £11,000 in benefits over a two year period between 1993 and 1995, Judge Keith Cutler, the Recorder of Winchester, heard. The court heard the couple faked a letter from a real-life respected ophthalmologist, stating that their son's reported blindness was untreatable, which they faxed to insurance company AIG . The original accident took place in June 2010 outside the Bulford Camp army base, in Wiltshire, where Mr Jones was a serving officer and the couple lived at the time. Their scam unravelled less than two years later after the couple tried the same scam again, alerting insurance investigators to a possible fraud. This time they put in a £35,000 claim to AIG stating that their car had backfired in the garage, leaving Mrs Jones deaf in her right ear. After officers began probing the fraud the former Lance Corporal applied for voluntary redundancy from the British Army, receiving a £42,107 payout. Police immediately seized the cash and will now return it to the defrauded insurers. Nicholas Cotter, defending Jones, said the former Lance Corporal was a man with 'difficulties.' He told the court that the former soldier, who was recently working as a machinist, was 'frightened' of going to jail because he would not be able to care for his two children, step-children or gravely ill partner of nine months. Jones, pictured outside court, applied for voluntary redundancy from the British Army after the fraud was probed and received a £42,107 payout . 'When someone has their fingers caught in the till, they don't put them back in there again,' Mr Cotter said. 'He knows he is the author of his own misfortune, he has put himself in this position but those things do frighten him that the door will close shut.' It also emerged Jones had previously been handed a caution for assaulting his wife in April last year. The couple have two other children other than the son they involved in their deceit, a daughter and another son, aged four years. Defending Mrs Jones, Tom Wainwright said her husband had 'worn the trousers' in the relationship and that one of the forged letters to AIG had been sent from the guard room at the barracks where he was stationed. He said Mrs Jones' personal problems were 'significant' and called on the court to take a 'merciful and lenient course' after she got a job as a carer, despite suffering from diabetes and angina. Mr Wainwright appealed to the judge to consider the effect on the family's three children of jailing both parents, in particular on their eldest son. 'It has had a very serious effect on him,' he said. 'A young man with Asperger's can have great difficulty computing that and any change to his routine can have real psychological problems. 'This would not be just a change it would be a complete upheaval. 'She is trying to hold her family together as best as she can, but of course she has to be punished,' he acknowledged. Mr Wainwright said the money had mostly been spent on paying off household bills and debts, saying: 'They were not flash cars or flash holidays or anything of that nature.' However the couple's bank records showed that as well as paying off their debts, they had splashed their windfall on a Mitsubishi Lancer sports saloon. Detectives brought in to probe the couple's actions discovered that following their son's accident they had forged medical letters, claiming to be from doctors at Salisbury District Hospital, to vastly exaggerate the extent of his injuries. The court heard the crudely written letters were littered with factual inaccuracies and grammatical errors. When detectives contacted the hospital, they were told that Mrs Jones had repeatedly failed to take her son to scheduled medical appointments and that, when she had, a specialist had confirmed that the boy was able to see in both eyes. Sentencing the pair, Mr Recorder Cutler said: 'To forge a letter such as that from a consultant in the National Health Service and making such claims is clearly an appalling act - not only just dishonest, certainly devious but many might think despicable. 'I am satisfied that that was a joint forgery, it is a joint document. 'I am sure that £70,000 to your family at that time made you all as a family, happier and you were able to buy a car and other things. 'It was not clear whether any money was put aside for [your son's] benefit, or for when he was older. [He] is not a part of this, he is someone whose unfortunate accident has led to this crime being committed.' City of London Police Detective Inspector Oliver Little, Deputy Head of the Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department, said: 'Jeremy and Sally Jones shamelessly lied to their insurer about their young son's health to gain tens of thousands of pounds that they were not entitled to. 'Resolute on getting a payout they even forged medical documentation to support their spurious stories. 'Their downfall should serve as a lesson to anyone thinking of submitting bogus personal injury claims, off the back of actual or made up incidents, the Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department is working with industry to put you before the courts.' David Halstead, Fraud Manager at AIG, added: 'Today's sentencing sends out the clear message that those committing fraud are increasingly likely to get caught, prosecuted and found guilty. 'AIG will continue to take a tough stance on tackling insurance fraud. Customers should not have to pay the price for fraudsters through higher premiums.'","Jeremy and Sally Anne Jones forged medical documents to show their son suffered irreversible eye damage after falling off his bike .

"This is the moment an unscrupulous conman pretended to slip on a plastic bag in Lidl to fraudulently claim thousands of pounds in compensation. Waheed Iqbal can be seen strolling through the supermarket in Bradford, west Yorkshire, before strategically placing his trolley next to a brown paper bakery bag on the floor. The 36-year-old eased himself onto the ground before a team of store workers and shoppers rush to his aid. Scroll down for video . Conman Waheed Iqbal was seen on CCTV lowering himself onto the ground while holding onto his trolley before fraudulently claiming he had slipped on a bakery bag in Lidl . After being carted off in a wheelchair, the textile businessman got out of an ambulance on its way to A&E to go back to the store to speak to a manager, Bradford Crown Court heard. The following day he complained of vomiting and bleeding, telling medics he had hurt his leg, back and shoulder in the fall. After contacting insurers working on behalf of the supermarket and staging a separate accident at a gym where he claimed to have been knocked out by a punching bag, Iqbal put in claims for £10,000 in compensation. Fraud investigators however uncovered CCTV footage revealing the man's fraudulent behaviour. He was sentenced to 10 months in jail, suspended for two years, and ordered to repay thousands of pounds to the supermarket, gym and the NHS. Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Rose said: 'You have been described as a fool. You are not a fool, you are a criminal and you have sought to steal, not from insurance companies, but from every decent responsibly person who pays their premiums.' He was also sentenced to 280 hours of unpaid community work. The 36-year-old called for help and was rushed off in a wheelchair by a group of store workers and shoppers .

"Think you know what  makes you reach for your credit card? Think again. A new infographic compiled by Alternatives Finder reveals that 95per cent of the buying decisions we make are unconscious, which leaves of lot of room for retailers to manipulate our minds, and more specifically, our senses. From using navy color schemes, which attracts bargain hunters, to playing certain melodies that facilitate conversations between browsers and sales reps, marketers use a wide range of tricks to influence our shopping habits. Color: A study on auction website eBay found that a red background on the results page led users to place higher bids on Nintendo Wii's . As far as packaging is concerned, according to the infographic, blue is seen by consumers as being welcoming, green evokes 'nature', red signals danger or urgency and yellow prompts associations with happiness. Impulse buyers tend to be attracted to red, black, orange and royal blue, whereas 'smart buyers on a budget' respond best to teal, light blue, pink and navy. Similarly, shopping 'conformists' are drawn to light blue, pink and also rose hues. A study on auction website eBay found that a red background on the results page led users to place higher bids on Nintendo Wii's. Red is associated with aggression and is thought to amp up more of a competitive atmosphere. Scent sells! The smell of freshly baked goods doesn't just entice you to the bakery section of a supermarket, it also makes you think of buying a house, while floral smells can make you browse shops for longer . As for which colors we associate with food flavors, red goes hand-in-hand with sweet tastes, green signals sour, blue evokes bitter tastes, and yellow is associated with salty foods. And when it comes to our noses, different smells can have a surprising impact on our buying behavior. It's fairly well-known that lavender and chamomile scents can be relaxing and that citrus scents can make you feel more alert. Talcum powder on the other hand, can apparently make you feel safe and nostalgic, barbecue smoke can make you perceive a room as smaller, while apple and cucumber does the opposite, and leads people to perceive a room as bigger. The smell of freshly baked goods doesn't just entice you to the bakery section of a supermarket, it also makes you think of buying a house, according to the infographic. Floral smells can make you browse shops for longer and spend more money, and some scents can even 'arouse' us, although it's different for men and women. Notes of lavender and pumpkin pie arouse men, while the smell of nursing mothers can apparently arouse women. Indeed, scientists believe the pheromones in breast milk act as a natural aphrodisiac. Bloomingdale's uses varying scents in different departments of its store to elicit certain emotions. Coconut is used in its swimwear department for a tropical feel, lilac is used in the lingerie aisles for a sensual appeal and baby powder is used in its infant section. Hands-on: Have you ever noticed how compelling it is to touch clothing in a store as you move through it, even when you have no intention of trying the items on? Marketers are onto this too . Neurologist Dr. Alan Hirsch conducted a study which found that 84per cent of participants were unknowingly willing to $10 more for a pair of Nike shoes shown in a scented room versus an identical pair in an unscented room. And have you ever noticed how compelling it is to touch clothing in a store as you move through it, even when you have no intention of trying the items on? Marketers are onto this too. A Harvard Business Review article states that items which are warm to the touch help us feel more trusting, and is thus effective when it comes to high-profile purchases like houses and cars. The article also cited a study which found that people offered lower prices while negotiating the price of a car if they were seated on a hard chair rather than a cushioned chair. Apple stores set their laptop computers open at an angle of exactly 70 degrees, which they measure using an iPhone app (of course), to invite touch. This angle is open enough to 'tease' buyers but not enough for them to view content. Even a two-second touch from another human can influence buying behavior. A Hogskolan i Halmstad dissertation cites that waiters who touch patrons draw in higher tips, and that store employees who touch shoppers encourage more sales. Tunes: Slower music increases the time you remain in a store and the money you spend - a ploy used by Borders bookstore, as well as countless supermarkets and department stores . As for our sense of hearing, music can have a pronounced effect on our shopping habits. Classical music increases 'quality sensation', according to the aforementioned dissertation, which makes it useful in wine cellars and spas for example. Slower music increases the time you remain in a store and the money you spend - a ploy used by Borders bookstore, as well as countless supermarkets and department stores. Fast music, on the other hand, keeps customers moving out of stores more quickly, which is an advantage for fast food restaurants.

"A five-year-old Scottish boy suffered a 'sickening and violent' death that was so gruesome medics had to be given counselling. The boy, named locally as Scott Chiriseri, was found by an ambulance crew called to a flat in Alva, Clackmannanshire, yesterday morning after a member of the public dialled 999. The boy, who is understood to have suffered a stab wound, was pronounced dead at the scene and residents of the Scottish town have today left tributes. Tributes were left outside the home of a five-year-old boy who was found dead yesterday morning . His mother, believed to be Zimbabwean Farai Chirashi, was being questioned by detectives last night. Neither the boy’s father, named locally as Tichakunda Chiriseri, or his older sister Natasha, are thought to have been at home at the time of the incident. Members of the emergency services who attended the scene are believed to have been offered counselling, according to the Daily Record. One of the medics told the paper the boy had suffered a 'sickening and violent death'. The little boy, who has been named locally as Scott Chiriseri, had sustained 'significant injuries' in incident . Forensics teams remained at the scene in Alva, Clackmannanshire, today continuing their investigations . Residents have left floral tributes and teddies outside the flat today, including the Alva South Bowling Club . Local streets were cordoned off, and forensic officers were seen searching the grass outside the flat, apparently looking for the weapon involved. Chief Inspector Stephen Sneddon said: ‘Emergency services in the Forth Valley responded to an address in Carnaughton Place, Alva, around 8.50am today in response to a call about the welfare of a five-year-old boy. 'On arrival, police officers found the child with a significant injury to his body. He was later pronounced dead at the scene by the Scottish Ambulance Service. ‘Inquiries into the full circumstances surrounding this incident are ongoing and a woman is currently detained in connection with the investigation. ‘We are not currently looking for anyone else and I want to reassure the local community that there is no risk to them. A police officer can be seen leaving another teddy among the other floral tributes after the 'horrific' stabbing . 'Shine bright and fly high' writes Brogan and his mother - a message among the dozens of tributes .

"Christine Lewis can remember the time when she used to take advantage of the simplest pleasures in life without feeling breathless. Now the 68-year-old, who has a long history of smoking, counts herself lucky if she makes it back to her house from her backyard. Even taking a shower leaves her exhausted. Daughter and nurse Vanessa McDonald, of Newcastle, was the first to notice there was something terribly wrong with her mother who became short of breath with minimal physical activity. Having a respiratory clinical background of 15 years, she knew straight away the diagnosis would be chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Daily Mail Australia can exclusively reveal there 1.5 million Australians effected by the serious chronic lung disease - most of whom are from regional areas. In severe cases those suffering from COPD may need lung transplants and if detected too late it can ultimately lead to death, a Queensland lung specialist said. Scroll down for video . Daughter Vanessa McDonald (left), a nurse in Newcastle, realised her mum Christine Lewis (right) became unusually breathless when they went for a short walk. Ms McDonald knew straight away her mum would be suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Ms Lewis, who used to regularly exercise back in the day, pictured with son Michael and daughter Vanessa . Ms Lewis with her son, daughter and husband Bill Lewis. They've all been very supportive since Ms Lewis was diagnosed with COPD . Ms Lewis says she used to be a very active person and used to go on daily 4km walks . Ms McDonald was visiting her mother at her home in Greta, a suburb in the Hunter Valley region which is two hours north of Sydney, when they decided to go for a walk. 'When I go to visit mum and catch up with her it's usually over coffee so I never noticed anything was wrong,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Then we were walking around together one day and she was quite breathless with the slightest amount of activity. That to me was evident that she had COPD. 'But when I told mum, she brushed it off saying it was just old age.' Ms Lewis admits she had been suffering from breathlessness for quite some time - one of the main symptoms of COPD - before her daughter urged her to see a doctor eight years ago. 'I was getting all puffed out just going for short walks but I thought it was just because I was getting old,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's getting worse now. I get worn out having a shower and I just can't go for walks anymore. 'I'm lucky if I make it to the clothesline and back.' This is an image of a healthy lung, unaffected by COPD which can cause breathlessness . A damaged  alveoli in the lung which is caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Having been a heavy smoker for more than 40 years, Ms Lewis decided it was finally time to quit her unhealthy habit. 'The disease has completely changed my life and I'm now so dependent on other people,' she said. 'I used to be very active in the past, especially because I don't drive so I walked everywhere. I used to go on 4km walks every day. 'It's very frustrating and I feel useless. I can't even go for walks on the beach with my daughter or grandchildren.' But her daughter also attributes the cause of COPD to her mother's dedication to her job as a weaving instructor at a local cotton mill for 30 years. 'Working at the  factory and with all the airborne particles which she had been inhaling for all those years - that would be one of the other contributing cause,' Ms McDonald said. Most of the highest rating areas of COPD hospitalisation are in remote and regional Australia . University of Queensland's professor John Upham - who's also been a senior lung specialist for 20 years - says the main causes of COPD are smoking, air pollution and exposure excessive amounts of dust. Professor John Upham, of the University of Queensland who's also been a senior lung specialist for 20 years, says COPD is a type of chronic illness damage air passage and lungs. It is mostly associated with smokers in Australia but can also be caused by air pollution and excessive amounts of dust. The top three symptoms include: shortness of breath, bringing up phlegm when coughing and wheezing. The top three symptoms include breathlessness, bringing up phlegm when coughing and wheezing. 'It's a disease that tends to go unrecognised because many people see the symptoms as a sign of being unfit or getting old,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Although COPD is typically common among those aged in their 60s, Dr Upham says there's an increasing number of younger patients suffering from the disease - in some cases needing a lung transplant. 'The numbers are definitely increasing because we're able to pick up COPD better and also people are living longer and exposed to more pollution,' he said. 'But also, these days, there's an increase of younger patients aged 40-50 years who are coming to me.' A recent report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has revealed some of Australia's most COPD affected areas - most of which are remote parts of the nation. The difference between a healthy lung and one that's affected by COPD - a chronic lung disease . Dr Upham believes smoking plays a major role in why more regional areas have COPD. 'There are studies showing that poorly educated and lower income areas have higher rates of smoking,' he said. 'So it can be seen that in regional areas COPD is higher because there are more smokers and less access to facilities to help smokers quit their habits, which also prevents early detection of the lung disease.' The AIHW study showed there were 59,265 hospitalisations for COPD from 2011 to 2012 among Australians aged 55 and over. Dr Upham says this 'isn't an economically smart way' of dealing with the disease, which can be eased by medication if diagnosed early. COPD cost the government about $929 million from 2008 to 2009. The majority of this cost was for patients admitted to hospital, according to the AIHW report. 'People can avoid hospitalisation if detected early but in most cases it's left too late so they need to be taken to through the emergency room,' Dr Upham said. 'Medication can help by slowing down the disease but cannot cure it. People have to live with it for the rest of their lives.' In Ms Lewis's case, she has been taking Bretaris Genuair - a medication which has recently been reimbursed by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme - to help her with the symptoms during the morning and night. Although she still faces limitations on a daily basis, Ms Lewis remains grateful for her daughter's quick observation eight years ago. 'Vanessa has been a godsend,' she said. 'She's always looking out for me.'","Christine Lewis was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease eight years ago .

"A young actor was found dead after a thug who tortured him for 14 hours was released from prison, it has been revealed. Jamie Morrison’s body was discovered at his flat in Edinburgh last Tuesday, the day after he missed the premiere of his first big screen film. His mother, Margaret, has now revealed the 27-year-old chose to take his own life rather than live in fear of a man who had subjected him to a brutal attack two years ago. Scroll down for video . Jamie Morrison (left) was found dead the day after Billey Harvie (right), the thug who tortured him for 14 hours, was released from jail . Billey Harvie was released from jail after serving half of his three-year sentence for attacking Mr Morrison while he was holding him captive. The 24-year-old is said to have slashed and beaten Jamie during the ordeal. Margaret revealed her son's torment on the day of the talented actor's funeral. The Daily Record quotes her as saying: ‘My beautiful boy is gone because he was frightened and he just couldn’t take it any more. ‘After Harvie got out of prison, he just didn’t feel safe. I am heartbroken. He was so loved and was such a talented, wonderful boy.’ Mr Morrison had recently landed a role in Skeletons - a short movie directed by Craig-James Moncur. The film got its  first showing at the Edinburgh Filmhouse on Monday night at an event attended by notable figures from the Scottish film industry.

He later described Mr Morrison as having 'an infectious enthusiasm that really rubbed off on others'. Harvie was released from prison in April and reportedly returned to ‘Welcome Home’ banners. Mr Morrison later moved addresses to the other side of the city. Harvie was jailed for three years at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in February 2013 after being convicted of the attack on Mr Morrison – but was let out after 14 months with some of his sentence backdated because of time he had already spent in custody. The Daily Record reports that he returned to jail again later and was finally released in late summer.

"The wife of a teacher accused of raping young boys at a school in Indonesia says he was betrayed by the parents of students from her own nursery class. Tracy Bantleman made headlines around the world this week when she was pictured reaching out to her husband Neil as he stood behind bars awaiting trial. The 43-year-old, who teaches alongside her husband at the Jakarta International School, is adamant he is innocent but worries he will be convicted and sentenced to up to 15 years in jail because of the country's high conviction rates. She said: 'My husband has a strong character but that doesn't mean that on the inside this hasn't been extremely demoralising for him. 'Although he is optimistic [the case will be dropped] he is extremely fearful that the outcome could be very unfavourable because there is quite a high conviction rate in Indonesia for criminal cases.' Scroll down for video . Neil and Tracy Bantleman, pictured at a wedding in Scotland in July 2013, are staying together despite allegations he has abused a young boy at the Jakarta school where they both work . Tracy Bantleman visits her husband, Canadian teacher Neil Bantleman, right, at Cipinang Penitentiary Institution in Jakarta on December 5 . Tracy Bantleman made headlines around the world this week when she was pictured reaching out to her husband Neil as he stood behind bars awaiting trial . Bantleman, 45, who was born in London and holds dual British and Canadian citizenship, and an Indonesian teaching assistant, deny raping and sexually abusing young boys. The allegations are part of a wide-reaching case that has shook the prestigious school - which is attended by the children of foreign diplomats and Indonesia's elite - to its core. Earlier in the year five school cleaners were accused of raping a young boy and a woman was accused of being an accomplice. One of the cleaners has since died in police custody. Officers say he committed suicide by drinking bathroom cleaner. Bantleman and teaching assistant Ferdinand Tjiong, known as Ferdy, were later accused of sexually abusing the same boy on June 6 - the second from last day of school. Recalling the moment they found out, Mrs Bantleman said: 'Neil got a phone call from the head saying another parent had come forward alleging that he and Ferdy had abused this boy. 'I looked at my husband and he was white. I remember clearly the first thing that came out of my mouth was, 'how could someone be so inhumane to make allegations like that so recklessly and carelessly'. 'I was furious because I knew this kind of allegation against a teacher is absolutely the worst allegation that could be made, and once it is made and it is public, your name is all over the place and you have no control over that. 'There has never been a more challenging and emotionally frustrating and tumultuous time in my life. One allegation by one woman has destroyed so many people's lives. 'The amount of stress it has caused Neil and I as a family, and our families abroad, our friends, our colleagues, is enormous. 'Everyone was shocked and appalled. 'People who know Neil and know Ferdy, know these are two absolutely good-intentioned well-rounded, balanced, very kind and gentle, well-respected members of our school community. Tracy Bantleman, visiting her husband yesterday, says he could not even pick the boys he is supposed to have abused out of a crowd . Neil and Tracy Bantleman, pictured here attending a friend's wedding in Bali, Indonesia, are staying together despite allegations he raped and sexually abusing young boys at a Jakarta school attended by the children of foreign diplomats and Indonesia's elite . Canadian teacher Neil Bantleman, right, kissed his wife Tracy prior to the start of his trial hearing at South Jakarta District Court in Jakarta, Indonesia, last week . 'Even our friends back home, our colleagues back in Canada, people we have met around the world, are shocked and appalled that these allegations have been brought forward. 'These people know that Neil is innocent and know that Ferdy is innocent - and they know these allegations are ridiculous.' Bantleman, who met his wife on a date in Calgary before marrying in Las Vegas in 2007, has so for spent more than three months in the notorious Cipinang Penitentiary Institution awaiting trial. He sleeps on a bench in a 6ft by 15ft mosquito-infested cell, separated from the main population of the prison. Mrs Bantleman hopes the case will be thrown out this coming Tuesday and says Bantleman's legal team will argue that the accusations in the inditement are too vague. 'They didn't specify a date in any of the alleged assaults. There are no specific dates,' she said. 'It could have happened anywhere between January 2013 and March 2014 or sometime in 2013 or 2014 - at a time that could not precisely be remembered. That's actually written in the indictment. 'So the fact the prosecutor has prepared the inditement without a date or a specific time is against Indonesian law. For someone to defend themselves they have to know when it is alleged to have happened.' According to documents, the alleged victims told police that Bantleman raped them in a secret room in the basement of the school while a female videotaped the attack. The accusations have been especially difficult for Mrs Bantleman, as the alleged victims came from the nursery year groups she taught. But she says she has never doubted her husband for an instance, describing them as a couple who do 'everything together'. She said: 'My husband and Ferdy are named as having abused these boys that they don't even know. 'They couldn't pick them out of a crowd.

Neil Bantleman, pictured left, faces up to 15 years in jail if he is found guilty of sexually abusing young boys at the school but his wife is standing by him . 'I taught kindergarten and before that early-childhood, so students between three and six-year-olds. 'I was there all the time. I would walk past his office four times a day. 'The building where the alleged crimes are alleged to have taken place is a massive aquarium and made of glass walls. There is not private space in that entire building.' 'We are not the type of couple who do things separately. When we met we were both in our mid-thirties and were overjoyed to find each other. We have a very close relationship. There is nothing that would ever give me the opportunity to doubt, there is no doubt.' The school has also backed Bantleman and Tjiong, with nearly 100 people turning up to support them on the first day of their trial, on Tuesday. Mrs Bantleman says it would have been even greater if it had not been a school day. She said her husband has been an integral part of the local community and had invested in 15 local charities with the aim of inspiring young people. But they are both now questioning whether they will stay in the south-east Asian country should the trial be dismissed. 'He feels like he has given so much [to the community] and this is what he has got back in return. It just isn't fair,' added Mrs Bantleman, who said they had been hoping to start their own family soon. 'Ideally, we would like to stay. We have had nothing but a fabulous experience in this country. 'The people are very warm the culture is very rich. It's a fascinating and diverse archipelago of islands. It's an unbelievable country, that way. 'But on the human side - one or two or three individuals have really made our life a horrific experience since June.' Bantleman, from Burlington, Ontario, and Tjiong are accused of raping three young boys at the school, which teaches 2,400 students aged from three to 18 from about 60 countries. The family of one nursery school boy are suing the school and seeking $125m in damages. Bantleman's family in Canada are also backing him have called on Canadian authorities to lobby on his behalf. He is due back at South Jakarta District Court on Tuesday.","Teaching assistant Neil Bantleman was accused of attacking a small boy .

"The parents of Reeva Steenkamp today backed calls for Shrien Dewani to give evidence over the murder of Anni Dewani - supporting her parents' campaign to ensure the case is not dismissed. Barry and June Steenkamp urged the judge to make the accused face justice on Monday, and offered their condolences to Vinod and Nilam Hindocha whose daughter, like Reeva, was shot dead in South Africa. Mr Steenkamp and Mr Hindocha spoke on the telephone from Port Elizabeth and Cape Town and discussed the similarities in their cases. Both their daughters, who were in their twenties, were gunned down with their partners accused of their murders in incidents which shocked South Africa and threw the country's record of gun violence into the spotlight. The killings, more than two years apart, put the South African legal system under huge scrutiny as Reeva's killer was cleared of murder despite firing four bullets and Shrien Dewani may walk free on Monday without offering any defence. Scroll down for video . Support: June and Barry Steenkamp, whose daughter Reeva was killed by Oscar Pistorius, have sent their support to the parents of Anni Dewani to say 'We are in the same boat' In pain: Nilam and Vinod Hindocha, Anni's parents, told MailOnline they were deceived by Shrien Dewani over his sexuality. Their bid for him to face trial is being supported by the Steenkamps . Gun crime epidemic: Reeva Steenkamp, left, was shot by her boyfriend Oscar Pistorius on Valentine's Day last year, he was found guilty of manslaughter. Anni Dewani's husband Shrien is facing trial for her murder . Cleared? Oscar Pistorius was cleared of murdering girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp but found guilty of manslaughter while Shrien Dewani, who is accused of killing his wife, will find out if he is to stand trial on Monday . Reeva was shot dead by athlete Oscar Pistorius, the double amputee who made history by competing in both the Paralympics and Olympics of London 2012. He was cleared of murder, but found guilty of culpable homicide and given a five-year prison sentence after he claimed he mistook Reeva for an intruder as they slept. Shrien Dewani is on trial for murdering Anni who was killed by a single bullet to the neck with her husband accused of masterminding and staging the shooting to look like a robbery. The Western Cape Court will decide on Monday whether the Bristol millionaire businessman can walk free with no case to answer or whether his trial must continue. He has applied for the charge against him to be dismissed claiming the prosecution have no evidence against him and he should not need to offer any defence. Mr Steenkamp confirmed to MailOnline that he and his wife are supporting Anni's parents in their bid to get the judge to continue the case and have offered their sympathy. Mr Hindocha said today: 'I am delighted that Reeva's parents have said they will support us and am very grateful for that. 'Mr Steenkamp and I talked about Reeva and Anni and I gave him my sympathy too. 'Only he and I as fathers can properly understand the pain of losing a daughter to bullets and then experience very difficult and high profile cases. Sham: Shrien and Anni Dewani married in a Hindu wedding that her parents described as 'false' after he was discovered to have been sleeping with gay prostitutes . Rage: Oscar Pistorius was accused of shooting Reeva Steenkamp dead in a fit of rage but the judge found that he mistook her for an intruder . 'Reeva's father told me 'we are both in the same boat' and that I needed to be strong. He and his family had been following our case. 'He hoped that we would get the right to hear the full case here and that he felt for us. 'I told him I am very sorry about what happened to Reeva and I know there is to be an appeal against the judge's decision in the Pistorius case and they also have our support on that.' The Steenkamps are unhappy with the outcome of the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius and are appealing against the verdict and the sentence given to the athlete who is known as 'Blade Runner.' He shot his model girlfriend Reeva during the middle of the night in his Pretoria home on Valentine's Day last year after she made a last minute decision to spend the night, having told her flat mate she would be returning. He claimed he thought an intruder had entered his home, but Reeva was gunned down with four bullets piercing the toilet door where she had locked herself inside. Pistorius denied murder and was cleared by Judge Thokozile Masipa who ruled he did not intend to kill when he unleashed four bullets. Instead, she decided he had acted negligently and was guilty of the lesser manslaughter charge. So strong: Nilam Hindocha, who lost her daughter on honeymoon, and June Steenkamp, whose daughter Reeva was killed on Valentine's Day last year, have fought for justice for their girls . Justice for Anni: Honeymoon murder victim Anni's father, Vinod, is campaigning for Shrien to face trial . Grief: Reeva's father Barry Steenkamp, who had his head in his hands when evidence of his daughter's treatment was heard, has spoken to Anni's father Vinod to offer his condolences . His five-year sentence means he could be released after serving 10 months in jail to complete the sentence under house arrest at his uncle's home, a punishment described as 'shockingly light' by prosecutors. If Pistorius is found guilty of murder on appeal, he would face a minimum of 15 years in prison, but his defence team is gearing up for another court battle. Dewani denies any involvement in his wife's murder and claims he is being framed by the real killers, three men who organised the car jacking and robbery without his knowledge. Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni, the gunman, was given 25 years for Anni's murder.  Zola Tongo received 18 years following a plea agreement. Qwabi and Tongo are state witnesses and accuse him of organising the shooting of Anni in Gugulethu township on November 13 2010. Mngeni has died in custody from a brain tumour. Anni died in the back of a taxi on honeymoon when two men attacked the vehicle and took it over at gunpoint, releaseing Dewani and driver Tongo. Tongo later told police he had been hired by Dewni for £1400 to enlist the gangsters and stage a robbery and carjacking. Anni's family are in the centre of a campaign to press the judge Jeanette Traverso to throw out Dewani's claim to have the case dismissed on Monday. Her brother Anish said: 'We just want the whole story and after four years, not many people would deny us that. It would be disgraceful if Shrien is allowed out of South Africa without going through a full trial and telling us what happened. 'We need to hear his story so that we can receive closure and try and move on with our lives'.","June and Barry Steenkamp want Dewani to face full trial for murder .

"It just wouldn't be Christmas without turkey, tinsel and top politicians' desperately trying to say something about themselves with their official festive cards. Once again we have David Cameron posing outside Number 10 and Ed Miliband posing with his children. But Nick Clegg - not used to winning much these days - must surely be judged to have the best card this year, posing in a Santa hat in a series of photobooth snaps with wife Miriam in a festive jumper. Scroll down for video . Nick and Miriam Clegg shed the straight-laced image usually seen at political events (left) for this photobooth-style card, posing in a Santa hat and festive jumper . Each year the leaders' cards are carefully scrutinised to see what message they are trying to convey to voters. This year is especially important, with just five months to go until the general election. Mr Clegg, who in the past has asked his three sons to design his card, has chosen an offbeat series of passport photo-style images with his wife. The couple are shown in four shots, with the Deputy Prime Minister donning a Santa hat before holding up a sign saying 'Merry Christmas!'. Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha as they pose for a picture outside 10 Downing Street in London with Chelsea Pensioners on their card . Ed Miliband's card shows the Labour leader with his children Daniel (aged 5) Sam (aged 4) and wife Justine as they made Christmas cards for their family at their home in London . By contrast, Mr Cameron has once again opted for a picture with his wife Samantha outside the door to Number 10. They are seen posing in Downing Street with Chelsea Pensioners before hosting a reception for the war veterans held in July. Mr Miliband, who hopes to take the keys of Number 10 in May next year, again chooses an informal portrait of his family, with wife Justine and their sons Daniel, aged 5,  Sam, 4. They are seen making Christmas cards at their home in North London. It is not easy to get these things right. When Tony Blair's card was released this week, it was met with ridicule. The picture, which was shared online, provoked widespread mirth for the awkwardness of their pose, the lack of festive cheer and most bizarrely of all Mr Blair's teeth. In the photo, Cherie appears to have attempted to portray a softer look, wearing a scooped neck red dress and matching ruby accessories she leans into her husband, resting one hand on his chest.

"It is 45 years since John Wayne took home an Oscar for his role as Rooster Cogburn in True Grit. But today the wily US Marshal made an unlikely comeback: in a news flash about a prison break. In a shambolic mix up on WDKY Fox 56, a picture of the late actor's iconic role flashed on viewers' screen with the caption 'Michael Fleet' - the name of a convicted thief who escaped from a Kentucky prison last week. Comeback: John Wayne's Rooster Cogburn appeared on Fox viewers' screens in a story about a prison break . Similar? The character, for which Wayne won an Oscar, was used instead of Michael Fleet's mugshot (right) His face, complete with eye patch and cowboy hat, appeared alongside that of serial burglar Joshua Stephenson, the other inmate who ran from his cell and hid in his ex-girlfriend's apartment for five days. Apologizing for the confusion, station managers explained the photo Cogburn is the default image for mugshots before they are uploaded. Due to an error before the 10pm screening, Michael Fleet's mugshot was not programmed into the segment, leaving viewers with Wayne's growling expression. Fleet, who escaped Blackburn Correctional Center, is still on the run. Slip up: The station said the Marshal from True Grit is the default image for mugshots before they are uploaded . A '60s classic: Wayne, who died in 1979, was lauded for his role alongside Katharine Hepburn in the movie . Stephenson, 23, was detained on Thursday after police received a tip-off.

"Denial: Bryan Singer has called sex abuse claims filed against him 'sick' and 'outrageous' X-Men director Bryan Singer has called the sex abuse accusations made against him 'a sick twisted shake down' as he announces he will be missing press appearances for his upcoming movie in light of the allegations. Singer has been named in a lawsuit by Michael Egan, a former child actor who claims he was sexually abused by the director in the 1990s as part of a Hollywood sex ring. 'The allegations against me are outrageous, vicious and completely false,' Singer said on Thursday. 'I promise when this situation is over, the facts will show this to be the sick twisted shake down it is.' His statement explained that he did not want the claims to take attention away from the work he and the crew had carried out on 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', which will be released May 23. 'This fantastic film is a labor of love and one of the greatest experiences of my career,' he said. 'So, out of respect to all of the extraordinary contributions from the incredibly talented actors and crew involved, I've decided not to participate in the upcoming media events for the film.' In his lawsuit, Egan claimed that he was given drugs and promises of a Hollywood career while being threatened and sexually abused in Los Angeles and Hawaii. One of his alleged attackers, internet businessman Marc Collins-Rector, was convicted of sex abuse charges in the years after the attacks, but this is the first time Singer has been named. 'Victim': Singer's accuser, Michael Egan, held his weeping mother at a press conference on Monday . But . Singer's lawyer has said that credit card receipts, telephone records . and production schedules show that he was not in Hawaii when a lawsuit . claims he sexually abused Egan. Singer . was mainly in Toronto working on the first X-Men movie from August . through October 1999, defense attorney Marty Singer told The Associated . Press. 'This . was Bryan's first studio film,' Marty Singer said. 'Clearly, he's not . going to take a break in the middle of this movie while you're shooting . and prepping it to go to Hawaii.' Marty . Singer - no relation to his client - said the filming records were . available publicly but 20th Century Fox did not immediately return a . phone call and email seeking comment. X-Men . was released in July 2000. Singer has directed three films in the . blockbuster franchise, including the fifth installment, X-Men: Days of . Future Past,  as well as other films including The Usual Suspects. His . lawyer said the director was never interviewed by any authorities about . the claims by Egan, who has said that he reported the Los Angeles acts . and doesn't know why charges were not pursued. Named: Egan also claimed LA design firm head Gary Goddard, left, and former BBC Worldwide America president Garth Ancier, right, sexually abusing him when he was a teen model in the 1990s . Accused: Disney TV president David Neuman, pictured, was also named in a recent lawsuit by Egan . Days . after filing the suit against Singer, 31-year-old Egan filed additional . suits against former BBC Worldwide America president Garth Ancier, . former Disney TV president David Neuman and theme park design firm head . Gary Goddard. Attorneys for Goddard called the charges 'without merit,' while David Neuman addressed the charges in a series of tweets, calling them 'completely false' and 'shocking'. Egan . appeared at a news conference on Monday alongside his mother and sex . abuse attorney Jeff Herman at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. 'Hollywood . adults are armed with something other adults aren’t armed with,' said . Herman. 'It’s a tremendous amount of power...the power and influence to . really make kids careers.' Herman said that he's already got witnesses to the crimes waiting in the wings. One reporter asked Egan what he had to say to his alleged abusers. Scandalous: Now that director Bryan Singer is embroiled in two teen sexual assault lawsuits, someone still has to go out and promote X-Men: Days of Future Past . 'You . won't have another chance to hurt another child,' he said as his mother . wept beside him. 'And for the people who have been abused, please come . forward.' The lawsuit was filed under a Hawaii law that temporarily suspends the statute of limitations in sex abuse cases. The law has led to several lawsuits against clergy members and others. MailOnline does not typically name . victims of sex abuse but is naming Egan because he is speaking publicly . about his allegations. A judge in Hawaii set a July 21 scheduling hearing in Honolulu for the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday.","Former child model Michael Egan has accused the X-Men director of sexually abusing him as part of a Hollywood sex ring .

"As Manchester United manager, he didn't always have much luck on the communication front. But David Moyes seems determined to show he has nailed the  language barrier at his new place of employment - by reeling off the four most common words in Spanish. Faced with a room of Spanish journalists during a press conference, the new Real Sociedad coach temporarily ditched his mother tongue and attempted to count to four in the local language. In the toe-curling interview, he even appeared to  follow in the notorious footsteps of Steve McLaren and Joey Barton by answering the question with an ever-so-slight Spanish accent. David Moyes attempted to show he had slotted into Spanish life during his Real Sociedad press conference by reeling off the four most common words in the Spanish language . The Sociedad boss said, 'they (B team) have been training with me uno, dos, tres, cuatro times' When asked about the B team's prospects, the 51-year-old Glaswegian told journalists that he had seen them train 'dos, tres, cuatro' times. But he couldn't quite keep up the charade, adding in English: 'But I have not seem them play.' The baffling interview comes after Moyes spent the first game of his new career in San Sebastian shouting 'Stefano' to his players - despite no-one in the squad bearing that name. A video of the press conference quickly spread online and the Scot was ridiculed for his bumbling efforts. Andy Jess wrote on Twitter: 'David Moyes trying to speak Spanish, it's like yer dad trying to order a meal on holiday... The waiter speaks better English than him.' Sergi Dominguez posted: 'Here's David Moyes attempting to speak Spanish. Couldn't have asked for a better laugh.' The baffling interview comes after Moyes spent his first game yelling out 'Stefano' to his players - despite no-one in the squad bearing that name . While Chris Schilling wrote: 'David Moyes' Spanish lessons are going well, I see.' And Max Sjoblom wrote: 'David moyes speaking Spanish reminds me of every hotel in Ibiza I've ever stayed in full of jocks'. The video prompted comparison with the excruciating Steve McLaren interview, which was carried out with Dutch media when he became a club boss there in 2008. In a television interview which became a huge hit on YouTube, McClaren appeared to emulate the great Dutch coaches Marco van Basten and Guus Hiddink by trying to sound like them. There was speculation that McClaren was deliberately speaking with a Dutch accent as a private joke but reports at the time suggested it was no prank - and that was how he spoke English over there. QPR midfielder Joey Barton was also ridiculed for his French accent at Marseille after a hilarious press conference in which he acknowledged that he sounded like a cast member of 'Allo 'Allo. In 2012, after making his debut for the club, Barton conducted his post-match press conference in English - but using a bizarre French accent . After the interview, Barton tweeted: 'Steve MaClaren (sic) eat your heart out...' He later added: 'In my defence, it is very difficult to do a press conference in Scouse for a room full of French journalists. 'The alternative is to speak like a 'Allo Allo!' character which is choose. Its simply a case of you had to be there. #youstupidwomen!' He even came up with a novel name for the language, and said: 'I am christening this new language Bartonese.' Moyes was appointed at Real Sociedad last month following his disastrous 10-month spell at Old Trafford. He is one of just a few British managers who have tried their luck abroad. The team drew Moyes's opening match, before winning 3-0 win  against Elche in the second game. But he made an faux pas during his first game when the touchline camera revealed he was frantically shouting 'Stefano!' at one of his players - despite having 11 days to learn his players' names. As Moyes talked about Real Sociedad afterwards, it was also noticeable that he slipped between 'they' and 'we'.","David Moyes speaks in Spanish during Real Sociedad press conference .

"Julie Bishop has taken a break from talking about foreign affairs to reveal how designer clothes help her do her job and why she envies the wardrobe of Sex and the City character Carrie Bradshaw. The 58-year-old politician is a fan of ‘investment pieces’ such as Armani suits coupled with Louis Vuitton and Christian Louboutin heels. ‘Give a girl the right shoes and she can take on the world,’ she told News Corp on her passion for feisty red stilettos.

Ms Bishop accessories with brooches, in a look inspired by US politician Hilary Clinton, and believes it’s her duty to wear clothes ‘that will promote an appropriate image for Australia’. It’s not all about big international fashion house names though – Ms Bishop also wears pieces from Perth designer Isabel Aujoulet.

Her revealing interview comes on the same day as the politician amused the Twittersphere with her passionate use of emojis in place of words, this time celebrating the start of parliament’s summer break with a cute Santa face and Christmas tree. Ms Bishop, whose popularity has doubled in recent times ranking her on par with the Prime Minister as the preferred Liberal leader, proved she’s ‘down with the kids’ by bringing out a range of smiley faces and sunshine signs on Twitter. Her comical tweet on Friday had been shared by 96 people at the time of writing, while one user commented: ‘I think a teenager has hacked your account.’ Julie Bishop arrives looking glamorous at the Midwinter Ball at Parliament House in Canberra . During her treasured half an hour 6km daily run she dons 2XU and Asics sports gear . Another joked: ‘Emoji use level: expert.’ The Foreign Minister thanked her staff at DFAT for a ‘stellar year’ in the tweet and said despite there being some more work travel to do (spelled out by a plane and globe emoji) she hoped they all had a ‘good break’. She followed the message with symbols of swimming, surfing, cocktail, sunshine, fishing and a goodbye wave.

After a prompt from Fairfax journalist Ben Cubby, who exclaimed that the Foreign Minister 'sure does love her emojis', there was simply no stopping Ms Bishop who replied with a single 'cool' caricature – a smiley face wearing a pair of sunglasses. From there, the requests proceeded to roll in, pushing the Foreign Affairs Minister to see just how far she'd take the joke. 'Fully expecting @JulieBishopMP to deliver her next address to the united nations entirely in emoji,' kimjongeuan wrote, to which Ms Bishop swiftly replied with a row of emojis including a plane, the statue of liberty and a speaking face. Lycanzayn then tried their luck, asking '@JulieBishopMP send me an emoji story Julie please'. Again, Ms Bishop replied with a row of pictures including a plane and a biscuit. The jokes continued on until just after 11pm when the Foreign Minister, perhaps knackered from keeping up with today's youth, wrote 'iPhone has been wrested off me - no more (crying face) Time for (zzz emoji) good (moon) Twitter'.

The Tweets proved enough to win over one social media user, who replied 'I reckon you be a great prime minster, I hope you'll be in power one day'. Ms Bishop's emoji tirade was certainly not the strangest behaviour ever displayed by a politician over Twitter, however. Earlier in the month, federal member for parliament Michael Danby stumped his social media followers by posting ten consecutive cat memes to his Twitter page with no captions or explanations. While initially sparking rumours that his account had been hacked by a humourless Twitter troll, a spokesperson from his office soon revealed that the MP, who 'has a very keen and quirky sense of humour', was himself responsible for the stream of cat memes.","Julie Bishop is a fan of Armani suits and Louboutin heels .

"Sentencing: Judge Stephen Holt . An illegal immigrant branded a ‘one man crime wave’ was jailed for two years today for a string of new offences - just a year after winning £17,360 compensation for being unlawfully detained while awaiting deportation. Joseph Mjemer's list of 12 new crimes includes violence and handling stolen goods. The 29-year-old from Yiewsley, West . Drayton, arrived in the UK as a stowaway in 2003 and used at least five aliases and claimed to be from four . different countries. But last year a High Court Judge ruled he had been unlawfully held in prison while . immigration officials tried to establish where he came from so they . could deport him. By that time he had already committed more than . 20 offences. Sentencing him to jail today, Harrow Crown Court Judge Stephen Holt told bearded body-builder Mjemer: ‘You . could be described as a one-man crime wave that continues committing . very annoying offences, that frightens and distresses the public. ‘You have built up in the last few years numerous convictions, covering numerous offences. ‘I take into account your difficult . childhood, but where that was, who knows? Even you do not seem to know . and I take into account that you spent four-and-a-half years in Home . Office custody and the High Court ordered your release. ‘You have been given numerous chances and have failed to comply. The time has come for nothing other than a custodial sentence.’ ‘You . have a complete disregard for court orders and you have used up most of . your mitigation,’ Judge Holt told the defendant, adding: ‘You have been given . opportunities and not taken advantage of them.’ Ruling: Joseph Mjemer was awarded £17,000 in a taxpayer funded compensation payout after Judge Stephen Stewart QC ruled he was falsely imprisoned . His latest appearance before a judge saw Mjemer convicted of assaulting two 17-year-olds on an Underground . train, plus two counts of threatening behaviour towards a member of Tube . staff and a schoolteacher with a group of children. He was also convicted of unlawfully . possessing anabolic steroids, driving a motorbike while disqualified and . uninsured, handling a stolen iPhone and failing to attend court . hearings on four different occasions. These offences put him in breach of a . 12-month suspended sentence for handling a stolen car and this was . activated. Judge Stephen Stewart QC ruled that the last four months of Mr Mjemer's detention had been unlawful . He was also disqualified from driving for three years. Mjemer’s lawyer Mr Scott Wainwright . told the court: ‘He has difficulty with anger management. Keep in mind . this young man’s difficult upbringing. ‘He . was brought up in the western Sahara, in Algeria and this has had a . detrimental effect on his mental health and contributes to the volatile . way he seems to behave.’ The . lawyer claimed anti-psychotic and anti-depressant drugs Mjemer received . in Home Office detention affected his memory and ability to keep court . and probation appointments. Mjemer told the judge from the dock: ‘Probation have failed to help me, they have not referred me to the Hillingdon mental health unit. I have been kicked out of three surgeries because I cannot control myself. I can’t hear the word ‘no’.’ Last year Mjemer's lawyers argued at the . hearing in London that he had been unlawfully held in prison while . immigration officials probed his claim for asylum. High Court Judge Stephen Stewart QC . awarded him the compensation in November, last year for the period he . had spent in ‘administrative custody’.","Joseph Mjemer, 29, who has around 30 previous offences, was jailed for two years for latest string of crimes .

"Chelsea are in talks to buy AFC Wimbledon’s humble Kingsmeadow stadium with a view to using it as a venue for their youth and women’s teams. The 4,800-capacity stadium in Kingston-upon-Thames, which will host AFC Wimbledon’s FA Cup third round tie against Liverpool on Monday, is also home to Kingstonian, who play in the Isthmian Premier. The land is owned by Kingston Borough Council and the lease belongs to AFC Wimbledon, who bought it from Kingstonian in 2003. Chelsea are in talks to buy AFC Wimbledon’s humble Kingsmeadow stadium (pictured) AFC Wimbledon, however, are keen to return to their spiritual home in the London borough of Merton and ideally into a new ground on the site of the former greyhound stadium on Plough Lane, close to where the club’s original Crazy Gang legend was born. Plans for this new venture are at the public consultation stage of Merton Borough Council’s planning process but the club are optimistic of achieving the target to be back in Plough Lane for the 2017-18 campaign. They have been in talks with various interested parties about the future of Kingsmeadow, which is officially known as the Cherry Red Records Stadium, and Chelsea have struck a deal, according to the Surrey Comet. The 4,800-capacity stadium in Kingston-upon-Thames is also home to Kingstonian, who play in the Isthmian Premier . The Premier League club want a permanent venue for their youth and women’s teams because the U21 team is using Aldershot Town and the women Staines Town. Chelsea has a small stadium at the training ground in Cobham, but this has very limited public access. AFC Wimbledon issued a statement which said: “The Dons Trust, owners of AFC Wimbledon, can confirm that the club has been in discussions with a number of organisations, including Chelsea Football Club, over the future of Kingsmeadow, should our club’s proposal to move to a new stadium in Wimbledon be approved by Merton Council. 'These discussions are confidential and each proposal is being thoroughly evaluated to ensure it provides the best outcome for the area and the club. Kingston Borough Council and Kingstonian FC, of course, have been briefed about the discussions. The Premier League club want a permanent venue for their youth and women’s teams . The Wimbledon 'Crazy Gang' shocked everybody with their 1988 FA Cup final win against Liverpool in 1988 . 'Any change of ownership of Kingsmeadow is a Restricted Action, which requires approval by the membership of The Dons Trust before it can be completed. In the event that The Dons Trust Board believes that acceptable terms have been negotiated, then these will be presented to the membership for their consideration. Until then we cannot not comment any further.' Kingsmeadow will feature live on BBC TV on Monday when Liverpool visit in the FA Cup third round tie, which is a reprise of the famous 1988 final, when Wimbledon won 1-0 at Wembley. A Chelsea spokesman said: 'I can confirm Chelsea FC is in preliminary discussions with AFC Wimbledon regarding taking control of the Kingsmeadow Stadium in order to play our academy and women's matches there, should AFC Wimbledon proceed with its intended move to Plough Lane.'","Chelsea are planning the purchase of the Kingsmeadow stadium .

"Two girls high school basketball teams have been suspended from a regional tournament after both of them tried to lose a game. The ridiculous game between Riverdale High School and Smyrna High School, both in Tennessee, took place on Saturday in front of bemused spectators and referees. Both teams knew that losing the game would mean avoiding having to play nationally-ranked Blackman High School in an elimination match. The losing team would be placed on the other side of the regional bracket and would have a better chance of making it to the Region 4-AAA finals. Both teams had already been beaten by Blackman earlier in the season. Scroll down for video . Referees and spectators looked on as players on both teams deliberately missed free throws and were penalized for numerous violations . The game descended into a farce as players deliberately missed free throws, while numerous 10-second and half-court violations occurred. 'One time a Riverdale girl looked at one of the officials and gave the official a 3-second signal wanting him to call three seconds on her. Smyrna stood in the lane as well to have us call three seconds on them,' The Daily News Journal reported the referee saying. He also noted that Riverdale 'missed 12-16 free throws intentionally', and Smyrna 'wouldn't get the ball across the half-court line to get a 10-second count or to make us call an over and back violation intentionally'. The referee had had enough when a Smyrna player was about to deliberately attempt a shot at the wrong basket. 'That was when I called both coaches together and told them we are not going to make a travesty or mockery of the game.' 'We are not going to start trying to shoot and score for the other team.' Trevor Goodson who runs TeamSlink, a program that girls play basketball at college level, was at the game and filmed some of the ridiculous plays. On Twitter he said: 'This is disgusting and it's making both schools look bad.... I sure hope both coaches come out in the 2nd half w/ a change of heart.' The decision by the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (TSSAA) to suspend the teams came after the referee reported the incident. The Rutherford County schools were subsequently placed on restrictive probation by the high school association for the rest of the academic year and are on probation for the 2015-16 year. Both schools have also been fined $1,500. Trevor Goodson, who runs a program that helps girls get into college level basketball, was appalled by what he witnessed on the court that night . Principal Rick Powell of Smyrna and Principal Tom Nolan of Riverdale met with TSSAA officials to ask that their teams be allowed to continue to play. They instead suggested removing the respective coaches, Shawn Middleton at Smyrna and Cory Barrett at Riverdale, for the remainder of the season. However TSSAA executive director Bernard Childress stuck by the decision to suspend the teams saying that it was derived from the actions of the players on the court. 'The student athletes bought into it,' Childress said. 'They were the ones asking to call three seconds. They were the ones stepping back over [midcourt]. They were the ones not attempting to shoot at the basket.' Both coaches have been suspended until the end of the 2015-2016 school year and neither is allowed to have any role in athletics in Rutherford County. Both schools appealed for their teams to be allowed to continue to play, but the local athletic association ruled that the student athletes had bought into the scheme to intentionally lose the game . A referee talks to Riverdale coach Cory Barrett (left) and Smyrna coach Shawn Middleton (right) during Saturday's game. Both coaches have been suspended . Rutherford County Director of Schools Don Odom said in a statement: 'Rutherford County Schools apologizes to the Riverdale and Smyrna High basketball players and parents for the lack of leadership exhibited by two of our coaches last Saturday evening in the district consolation game.' 'Players lost opportunities to compete in a regional tournament, lost opportunities for all-tournament status and to showcase their individual talents to collegiate scouts.' 'We also apologize to the citizens of Rutherford County because of the embarrassment generated locally and nationally for teams motivated to throw a game.' The game eventually ended 55-29 with Smyrna winning. The suspensions meant that Tullahoma, who were scheduled to play Riverdale, advanced to the Region 4-AAA semifinals without play. Lawrence County, scheduled to play Smyrna, also advanced.","Teams from Riverdale and Smyrna high schools in Tennessee wanted to bypass meeting a nationally-ranked rival in the semi-finals of a tournament .

"Condemned: A federal judge has refused to stop the upcoming execution of Ohio killer Dennis McGuire, who raped and murdered a pregnant woman in 1989. He faces a never-tried lethal injection process that lawyers say could cause him agony and terror . A condemned Ohio killer who is due to be executed tomorrow, could face an agonizing death where he struggles to breathe in the last few minutes of his life. Inmate Dennis McGuire's lawyers had argued that the combination of the sedative midozolam and painkiller hydropmorphone could lead to a painful and terrifying phenomenon called 'air hunger' before he actually dies. It's the first time such a cocktail of drugs have been used in the state in this way, and the effects are unknown so much so that some have described the method as akin to an 'experiment'. Lawyers for McGuire have attempted to stop his execution . on the grounds he could experience a terrifying sensation of . suffocation and that his sentencing him to death is unconstitutionally . cruel. U.S. District Judge Gregory Frost said the condemned man did not present enough evidence that there is 'a substantial risk' he will experience the ""severe pain"" that would constitute a violation of the ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Last year, 450-pound inmate Ronald Post argued he was so overweight he could not be put to death humanely. Double-killer Richard Cooey made a similar argument in 2008. In 2010, serial rapist Darryl Durr argued he might be violently allergic to Ohio's execution drug. Each time, U.S. District Court Judge Gregory Frost, a veteran of the state's capital punishment legal challenges, ultimately allowed the execution to proceed. In his latest ruling, he said Monday that McGuire had failed to present evidence he would suffer breathing problems alleged by his attorneys - a phenomenon known as 'air hunger' - and said the risk to McGuire is within constitutional limits.. Also, because . McGuire has several characteristics of sleep apnea, or the struggle to . breathe while asleep, the chances are even greater he will be subjected . to feelings of suffocation, an expert has warned. 'Mr. McGuire is at a substantial risk . of experiencing the terror of air hunger during the first five minutes . of the execution,' Professor David Waisel, of Harvard Medical School, . said. 'Air hunger is a horrible feeling,' Waisel added. 'It's the inability to get your breath.' Experimental: Some were concerned McGuire would experience terror as he strained to catch his breath due to Ohio's untested execution method . Punishment: The death chamber at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. Ohio used intravenous doses of two drugs, midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put McGuire to death . Ohio . plans to use intravenous doses of two drugs, midazolam, a sedative, and . hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put McGuire to death. The . method has been part of Ohio's execution process since 2009, though . never used. It was chosen because of a shortage of other lethal . injection drugs. That . said, Frost acknowledged the novelty of Ohio's never tried two-drug . combination, calling it 'an experiment in lethal injection processes.' Victim: McGuire, 53, was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of Joy Stewart in Preble County in western Ohio. The 22-year-old Stewart was newly married and pregnant . But . until a method violates the Constitution, 'The law teaches that Ohio is . free to innovate and to evolve its procedures for administering capital . punishment,' Frost said. The state opposed any delay, presenting evidence that disputed the air hunger scenario. McGuire, . 53, is scheduled to die Thursday for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing . of Joy Stewart in Preble County in western Ohio. Attorneys say they're . disappointed by the decision but pleased Frost recognized the untried . nature of the process. They haven't decided whether to appeal. McGuire . has a separate request before the U.S. Supreme Court to delay his . execution on the grounds that a jury never heard the full extent of his . chaotic and abusive childhood. The state asked the court Monday to . reject that appeal, saying McGuire's ""challenges to his sentence have . spanned decades and failed."" Post, . the overweight inmate, was spared by Gov. John Kasich because of poor . legal representation at trial, not his weight. He died of natural causes . in prison last year. Cooey was executed in 2008 for the rape and murder . of two female University of Akron students. Durr was executed in 2010 with no apparent complications as he died. As . long ago as the 1990s, prisoners in California argued that the state's . gas chamber could also produce ""air hunger"" in death row inmates. In . 1994, a judge found that prisoners in the gas chamber were likely to . suffer excruciating pain for between 15 seconds and several minutes. The . state has since adopted lethal injection but lawsuits have kept it from . being used. Frost's . ruling moved McGuire one step closer to execution by the two-drug . method developed after supplies of Ohio's former execution drug dried . up. Kasich has rejected McGuire's plea for clemency. Last . year, Frost rejected a challenge to the two-drug method by death row . inmate Ronald Phillips, who was set to become the first to die by the . new method until Kasich delayed his execution to study the feasibility . of Phillips' donating organs to family members. Supplies of Ohio's former execution drug, pentobarbital, dried up as its manufacturer put it off limits for executions. Ohio's . Department of Rehabilitation and Correction plans to use a dose of . midazolam, a sedative, combined with hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put . McGuire to death. The . combination of drugs Ohio intends to use has never been used in a U.S. execution. They are included in Kentucky's backup execution method, and . Florida uses midazolam as part of its three-drug injection process.","In wake of an apparently botched execution that left condemned man in agony, Ohio to try untested lethal injection procedures .

"The judge who heads the secretive Court of Protection called yesterday for its hearings to be thrown open to the Press. Mr Justice Charles told peers that open scrutiny of the controversial court’s hearings would improve the behaviour of everyone taking part, including judges. He brushed aside arguments that the Court of Protection – which makes decisions about the medical treatment, care and property of those who cannot decide for themselves – has a first duty to protect the privacy of families and individuals who come before it. The Court of Protection is part of the High Court and analyses issues relating to sick and vulnerable people . ‘The impact of proceedings having more sunlight let in, more transparency, outweighs the difficulties that in some cases some people may have in having their privacy invaded,’ the judge said. He also told peers the court’s routine secrecy may break human rights laws, that judges have been reluctant even to let the public know the outcome of the court’s cases, and that some judges and legal figures remain firmly opposed to letting outsiders know what goes on in its hearings. The call for open reporting of cases follows months of growing controversy. Set up six years ago under Labour’s Mental Capacity Act, the court can order people to be confined to care homes or decide whether desperately sick patients should die or be treated. One doctor told the court that the woman's physical and mental problems should lessen, and be easier to treat, once the baby was born . In April, the Daily Mail revealed that a Court of Protection judge had sent Wanda Maddocks, 50, to jail in secret. Miss Maddocks was sentenced to five months for defying the court by trying to free her father from a care home where she thought his life was in danger. Sir James Munby, head of the family courts, has repeatedly called for more openness. Mr Justice Charles yesterday threw his weight behind Sir James at the Lords inquiry into the Mental Capacity Act’s workings. Greater openness would ‘improve the performance of all involved in the court process’, he told peers. ‘I don’t exclude judges from that.’","Mr Justice Charles told peers that scrutiny of court would be beneficial .

"A world-record holding motorcyclist died on Sunday trying to top 300mph on a test track in Maine. Bill Warner, 44, died after he lost control of his bike and slid off the track, according to reports. The accident happened at the annual Maine Event, held at the former Loring Air Force Base. Warner, of Wimauma, Florida, died at a local hospital an hour after the accident occurred, a spokesperson said. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Bill Warner, 44, of Wimauma, Fla., holds his helmet while sitting on a motorcycle back in 2011 . Speed: In this July 2011 photo, Bill Warner poses for a photo during the Maine Event. He died on Sunday following a horrific crash at the track . The daredevil was alert and talking with emergency responders shortly after his accident, according to the Bangor Daily News. A spokesperson for Cary Medical Center in Caribou later confirmed Warner had succumbed to his injuries, the paper reported. Conflicting reports peg the speed Warner was travelling at between 260 and 285mph when he lost control of his modified turbocharged Suzuki Hayabusa, sliding around 1000ft. ‘He got maybe 4,000 feet or so, and where I was standing at the starting line, you could see a big dust cloud and then it got silent,’ spectator Cole Theriault told the paper. Warner, who sells tropical fish while not rocketing through time trials, previously achieved a speed of 311mph over 1.5 miles on the same track in 2011 - considered to be the land speed record for a conventional motorcycle. Daring: Bill Warner makes a run on his motorcycle during The Maine Event on a runway at a former air base on Sunday before his fatal crash .

Thrill-seeker: The 44-year-old, from Florida, was alert and talking after his crash but later died from his injuries . Rules posted on the Loring Timing Association website tell riders to veer to the left to slow down, veer to the right if there is a problem. Warner veered to the right, according to eyewitness accounts. ‘The bike, from what I heard, was demolished, just in pieces,’ Theriault said. ‘After a minute, all you could hear was the sirens.’ Calling the bike ‘significantly damaged,’ Limestone Police Chief Stacey Mahan declined to provide more details and said authorities were investigating. Shortly after setting the record in 2011, Warner spoke of his unmatched achievements. ‘The big part of it, after the speed happens, is trying to stop the bike,’ he told the Bangor Daily News. ‘Here at Loring Air Force Base, there is a mile shutdown to slow the vehicles down and I used every bit of it. 'The bike was bouncing, hopping, skipping and sliding. Needless to say, I got it stopped safely. It was a little scary.’ Prior to Sunday’s crash, Warner set a record of 296mph in only one mile. The track itself is just more than 2.5 miles. Event officials cancelled the rest of the Sunday’s events after the deadly accident.","Warner had competed in several events at the track over the years .
