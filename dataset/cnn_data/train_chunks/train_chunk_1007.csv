"Michael Carrick has backed David Moyes to prove a success at Real Sociedad and wished his former Manchester United manager good will. Moyes endured a torrid reign in charge of United and was sacked after 10 months as the club fell from champions under Sir Alex Ferguson to seventh in the Premier League. But he is set to restart his career in La Liga and Carrick, who played 40 games for Moyes, said: ‘I am pleased to see him back in the game. I wish him all the best. Michael Carrick (pictured appearing in a selfie at St George's Park) has backed David Moyes in Spain . Moyes was sacked by Manchester United after a tricky 10 months in charge at Old Trafford . 'I hope it goes great for him over there. It's a new challenge for him. He has proven with his track record over the years that he has been successful over such a long period of time. 'He will be frustrated with how things went last year as we all were but I am sure he will bounce back. Hopefully he can over there and do well.’ Carrick is making a comeback of sorts also, looking to earn his first England cap since October 2013 after missing out on last summer’s World Cup. Retirements by Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard mean the 33-year-old is the eldest member of the squad, but he is targeting Euro 2016 and beyond. 'Of course,' he said. 'I don't think this is my last season. The longer your career goes on, the more you appreciate things. You do start seeing the end and that's natural but I am enjoying things at the moment and I feel good. Carrick is making a comeback for England after going over a year without playing for Roy Hodgson's side . Carrick shields possession from Liverpool's Raheem Sterling during England training this week . 'Hopefully I do have a few years left still. I want to make the most of the opportunity now. It's great to be back now especially after the start of the season.' He admits he is frustrated not have won more than 31 England caps and he was disappointed Roy Hodgson failed to take him to Brazil but added: 'I am not complaining about it. I would have loved to have played more games for England but that's not really happened. At the moment I want to make the most of what is happening ahead. 'This is playing for your country. You have the best to choose from. We are fortunate we have had some special players over the years in midfield. It was frustrating. I wish I could have played more but there is no point looking back. I have to look forward and make most of the time I have left.’ Michael Carrick has revealed his brother Graeme was a better player than Wayne Rooney in their younger days. 'I first heard of Wayne when my brother played against him in the Youth Cup,’ said Carrick. 'Wayne was at Everton, Graeme was at West Ham. That was the first time my brother told me about him. 'He said he had the better of him, actually! He said he was going to be a special player, he could tell that then. ‘The goal against Arsenal was the one, that propelled Wayne into everyone's minds. Everyone saw what he was about. Ever since then you can't get rid of him!’","David Moyes has been appointed the new manager of Real Sociedad .

"Convicted rapist Ched Evans returned to an ordinary life after he was photographed out shopping in Cheshire's Alderley Edge. The former Sheffield United striker - who served half of a five-year sentence before being released from prison last week - was accompanied by supportive girlfriend Natalie Massey. The 25-year-old made a beeline for his car while carrying a number of bags filled with groceries from a local supermarket. Scroll down for video . Ched Evans and girlfriend Natasha Massey were photographed shopping in Cheshire's Alderley Edge . His girlfriend remained close by Evans' side, after leading a campaign to have his conviction overturned in a case review. His former club is split over whether the £3million striker should be re-signed, it has been claimed. The Blades denied rumours he was set to be offered a new two-year contract worth £500,000 following his release - but admitted they were continuing to 'deliberate' on a decision. Evans was released from prison last week after serving half of a five year sentence . Evans' girlfriend  has stood by him throughout and led a campaign to have his conviction overturned . But on Saturday it was reported that the club's board was divided over whether to let the disgraced Welsh striker play for them again. Evans' has maintained his innocence despite being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in his home town of Rhyl, North Wales, insisting it was ‘consensual and not rape’. The Sun quotes a source as saying: 'Club bosses seem to think having Ched back is the right thing. They want to help rehabilitate him. 'But some of the board are still uneasy. They could still be a few weeks away from making public their decision.' The newspaper reports that the club have declined to comment further. The 25-year-old has maintained his innocence despite being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman . Evans' old club Sheffield United are continuing to 'deliberate' over whether he should play for them again . Last week co-chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps issued a joint statement denying reports that they have offered Evans a new contract. They described the reports as 'false and damaging to the club' but added: 'We have made a statement on this matter previously and the lack of credibility and substance from this latest media report does not warrant any expansion from previous comments apart from noting that we are continuing to deliberate on any long term decision about Ched Evans.' It was reported that an online petition against Evans returning to Sheffield United had gained more than 150,000 signatures. Evans has issued a statement with Natasha pleading for a second chance to play football again . Evidence: Evans' victim on CCTV at the hotel in his home town of Rhyl, North Wales, on the night of the assault . Evans broke his silence for the first time on Wednesday to apologise to his girlfriend, 25. But he was criticised for not mentioning his victim - who had previously been named by trolls on Twitter and forced to change her name as a result. In the statement he said he has 'constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it'. He added: 'It is a rare and extraordinary privilege to be permitted to play professional football. Now that I've served the custodial part of my sentence of two and a half years, it is my hope that I will be able to return to football. But he said he was 'determined to continue to fight to clear my name' and has now submitted his case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

"The father of the woman raped by Ched Evans has pleaded for the former Sheffield United striker to stop trying to clear his name because it is 'destroying' his daughter. Evans released a video statement on Wednesday in which the 25-year-old offered no remorse, referred to the rape as 'an act of infidelity' against his girlfriend Natasha Massey and asked for a second chance in football. The victim has been forced to leave her family and  change her name three times to escape death threats from supporters of Evans, and her father says the footballer must abandon his campaign. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the video statement released by convicted rapist Ched Evans . Footballer Ched Evans, walking with girlfriend Natasha Massey, was jailed for five years  in April 2012 . Police gave former Sheffield United striker Evans' victim a new identity but her cover has been blown twice . Evans pictured in a car after his release from prison at Alderley Edge in Cheshire on October 20 . ‘Evans needs to apologise to my daughter rather than his girlfriend and to just shut the whole campaign down,' he says. ‘He’s shown no remorse and every time he makes some fresh appeal or comment, he draws attention to my daughter and risks her being identified and found. ‘She went into hiding because people were trying to track her down and kill her. There are only so many times you can keep changing your name. I don’t believe she’s that strong.’ Evans was jailed for five years in April 2012 for raping the 19-year-old waitress, who was judged to be too drunk to have given her consent to sex. The victim has a right to lifelong anonymity, but her name was revealed on Twitter and retweeted more than 6,000 times by those backing Evans. She has twice been uncovered despite being given a new identity, and her father insists all Evans cares about is returning to football. Evans (left) released a video statement on Wednesday pleading for a second chance back in football . Evans was convicted of raping a 19-year-old girl in April 2012, serving two-and-a-half years in prison . The 25-year-old apologised to his partner  Massey (right) for cheating on her with his victim at the time . ‘She’s having to go from one place to another,' her father adds. 'What kind of an animal is he to sit there in that video and keep destroying her? ‘He’s not only raped my daughter but added insult to injury. He’s still hurting her now that he’s out with the things he’s saying. ‘Every time she moves she has to cut with her old friends and make new friends. She is living the life of a prisoner. ‘All Ched Evans cares about is his career. He doesn’t care about what he did, or my daughter. He’s never shown any remorse, it’s just lie after lie that comes out of his mouth. ‘It’s an insult to my daughter and to all rape victims out there. If you do the crime you should do the time. Two and a half years is very lenient and he shouldn’t be allowed to go back to his career as if nothing has happened.’ Striker Evans scored 42 goals in 103 appearances for Sheffield United during three seasons at the club . Evans' last club was  League One outfit Sheffield United before his imprisonment for rape in April 2012 .","'She went into hiding because people were trying to track her down and kill her,' says the father of the woman raped by footballer Ched Evans .

"Convicted rapist Ched Evans and his former Manchester City team-mate Clayton McDonald bought a rattlesnake and a tarantula to frighten each other while living together. McDonald, who was cleared of rape in the same trial that saw Evans sentenced to five years in prison in April 2012, began the exchange by buying Evans the snake because he knew his friend was frightened of them, reports the Independent's Ian Herbert. Evans, 25, bought a tarantula in retaliation to the practical joke before the pair were told to get rid of the creatures by the family they were staying with in Stretford, Manchester. Ched Evans and former team-mate Clayton McDonald were 'bored witless' according to their houseparent . Greg Barnes told the Independent that while the incident was typical of the pair, he felt that Evans appeared foolish rather than violent and dangerous to him. Discussing the attitudes of Evans, McDonald and young footballers in general, Barnes said: 'When they are scholars they have a very rigid timetable, with lessons, training and games. When they are given a professional contract, that stops. 'They are out on their own. They are competitive kids and they are bored witless.' Sheffield United have denied offering Evans a new contract but refused to rule out signing him again . Evans signed a professional contract with City in 2007 and McDonald in 2008. Both left the club in 2009 for Sheffield United and Walsall respectively. Evans was released from prison earlier this month after serving half of his sentence. Mr Barnes' son Andrew, 25, last week claimed Evans shot him with an air rifle, before offering him more than £10,000 to keep it quiet. Andrew Barnes (pictured) was allegedly shot in the thigh by former Welsh striker Evans, who had been hiding behind a garage shed at Mr Barnes’s parents' home in Stretford, Greater Manchester . Mr Barnes (left) is pictured with pellets and showing the area on his inner thigh were he was shot. Evans was seen with his girlfriend Natasha Massey (right) in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, on Monday afternoon . Barnes was allegedly shot in the thigh by Evans, who had been hiding behind a garage shed at the family's home. After he had been shot with the gas-fired air rifle, the business consultant was taken to hospital with a pellet lodged in his bones - but doctors left it there over fears that removing it would be unsafe. Andrew Barnes told The Sun: 'I could see a hole in my thigh where the pellet had gone. Doctors said it was only my bone that stopped it going all the way through my leg and out again. Hospital X-rays showing the pellet still in Mr Barnes' leg. The business consultant was taken to hospital with a pellet lodged in his bones - but doctors left it there over fears that removing it would be unsafe . 'How can someone in their right mind fire an air rifle at a friend? He was quite far away when he fired. Had he moved the gun by millimetres, it could have hit my chest and killed me.' Mr Barnes claimed that before the shooting incident in 2009, he had seen Evans peering round the garage at the home and pointing the gun at him from about 50ft (15 metres) away. He added: 'Then I felt something in my leg and realised he shot me. Ched was always shooting things in the garden.' Mr Barnes said his mother found pellets in cupboard doors, walls, sinks, window frames and even the fridge. He said that shortly after the incident happened he launched legal action against Evans. Police allegedly questioned Evans and McDonald but no charges were brought. Just before Evans' rape trial, he offered Mr Barnes a £10,900 payout with a gagging agreement. The footballer was convicted of rape in April 2012, and the next month a £10,000 payout was agreed - for injuries and legal costs.","Ched Evans and Clayton McDonald bought each other a tarantula and a rattlesnake as practical jokes while living with houseparents .

"The former headmaster of a private school founded by novelist Nicholas Sparks says the author and other school leaders forced him out when he tried to recruit black students and faculty and supported a bullied group of gay students, and on Thursday he sued for damages. In the federal lawsuit, Saul Hillel Benjamin accuses Sparks of making racially and religiously dismissive remarks while Benjamin headed the college-prep K-12 school Sparks founded in New Bern, his hometown of 30,000 people about 100 miles east of Raleigh. Sparks is a prolific author of love stories that are regularly turned into Hollywood movies - among them, 'The Notebook,' 'Dear John,' and 'The Last Song.' The film adaptation of 'The Best of Me' will be released in theaters this month - the ninth of Sparks' 17 novels to be made into a movie, according to his website. Lawsuit: Saul Hillel Benjamin alleges that author Nicholas Sparks, pictured, was part of a group of school leaders that forced him out when he tried to recruit black students and faculty and supported a bullied group of gay students . Plaintiff: Benjamin (pictured) said Sparks and conservative Christian members on the school's board questioned his Jewish background and Quaker beliefs . School: Benjamin's lawsuit seeks lost income and punitive damages against Sparks, three other members of the board of The Epiphany School of Global Studies (pictured), and the Nicholas Sparks Foundation . Benjamin's lawsuit seeks lost income and punitive damages against Sparks, three other members of the board of The Epiphany School of Global Studies, and the Nicholas Sparks Foundation. 'Apparently, despite the efforts our society has made, Mr. Sparks wants to travel back in time and vilify those who promote diversity and tolerance of all people regardless of their sexual orientation and race,' said Douglas H. Wigdor, a New York attorney representing Benjamin. Theresa Sprain, an attorney representing Sparks in the case, denied the allegations in Benjamin's lawsuit. 'As a gay, Jewish man who has represented Nick for almost 20 years I find these allegations completely ludicrous and offensive,' entertainment attorney Scott Schwimer said in a statement released by Sparks' publicist. Benjamin was hired before the 2013-14 school year after professorial jobs in Morocco, Germany and Lebanon, according to his resume. He had four-year contracts with both the school and Sparks' foundation totaling $256,000 a year plus bonus and benefits, the lawsuit said. The school's website says it does not discriminate against applicants based on gender, race, color, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion. But Benjamin said that when he tried to recruit black students and teachers, Sparks told him 'diversity should not be measured by percentages of minority students enrolled or minority faculty employed,' according to the lawsuit. Benjamin said Sparks and conservative Christian members on the school's board questioned his Jewish background and Quaker beliefs. During one meeting, 'Sparks insisted that Mr. Benjamin stop talking about Islam, Judaism, or any other non-Christian religion' at school functions, the lawsuit said. 'That's not what our parents like to hear,' the lawsuit quoted Sparks as saying. 'Racism?' Sparks allegedly criticized Benjamin for attending an NAACP event . Popular: Sparks is a prolific author of love stories that are regularly turned into Hollywood movies - among them, 'The Notebook,' 'Dear John,' and 'The Last Song.' The film adaptation of 'The Best of Me' will be released in theaters this month . Sparks also criticized Benjamin for attending an NAACP event, according to the lawsuit. Benjamin said he attended to introduce himself to black parents whose children might apply for admission to the school if they were made to feel welcome. Sparks 'indicated that Mr. Benjamin should utilize less public and visible means if he sought to meet with African-Americans,' the lawsuit said. School trustees pressed Benjamin to stop supporting students who had been bullied after forming a club where they could discuss their sexual identities, the lawsuit said. One said Benjamin was 'promoting a homosexual culture and agenda.' The lawsuit also accused Sparks of locking Benjamin in a room at the school last November and shouting at the headmaster. Benjamin says that he feared for his safety and that the incident ended when he wrote a resignation letter.","Saul Hillel Benjamin, the former headmaster of a private school founded by Nicholas Sparks, says the author and other school leaders forced him out .

Elsewhere in Spain the attention is on international football, with the fall-out from La Roja's defeat to Slovakia continuing to dominate. Marca lead on 'Iker's torment' after goalkeeper Iker Casillas made mistakes for both the Slovakian goals, while AS call for David De Gea to replace the Madrid stopper. The Barcelona-based press focus on Barca's three biggest stars, Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez . Away from Madrid the focus is all on Barcelona's biggest three stars. Luis Suarez's return to form is heralded by Sport, after the former Liverpool striker scored on his return for Uruguay. Mundo Deportivo lead on the 'Clash of the Stars' between Neymar's Brazil and Lionel Messi's Argentina. The two Barca icons meet in the Superclassico de la Americas in Beijing on Saturday, in what the paper describes as 'the dream final we didn't see in the World Cup'. Giorgio Chiellini dominates the front pages in Italy, after he did just enough to earn Antonio Conte a win . In Italy the attention is on the national team's uncomfortable win against Azerbaijan, in which Giogio Chiellini scored all three goals, two headers for his country and a scrappy own goal. La Gazetta dello Sport says Chiellini's head is held high after the all action performance, while Tuttosport brands is the 'Chiello show'.","Jorge Mendes says move to Manchester United it 'impossible'

"Dan Martin's Giro d'Italia dreams were ended on the opening stage in Belfast as he suffered a serious crash. The .

Martin, . who had made this race the focus of his season, made little attempt to . get back up as he held his collar bone and waited for medical attention. Crash: The aftermath after Dan Martin appeared to slip on a drain in wet conditions during the team time trial . It was the . most dramatic illustration of the huge role the weather played as the . first Grand Tour of the season started under damp skies. Orica . GreenEdge took victory, gifting the leader's pink jersey to birthday . boy Svein Tuft, and although they had been the favourites they could be . grateful for being the second team out as they benefited from dry roads. The . rain soon began to fall, costing general classification hopefuls Nairo . Quintana (Movistar) and Joaquim Rodriquez (Katusha) significant chunks . of time against Nicolas Roche, whose Tinkoff-Saxo team held it together . as the roads became more and more slippy, as well as late starters . Rigoberto Uran and Cadel Evans. Cruel: Dan Martin (centre) had set his sights on winning stage one of the 2014 Giro D'Italia . The wet weather had not deterred thousands of fans from lining the Belfast roads, but the mood changed as the big screens showed Martin tumbling to the ground. Garmin-Sharp manager Jonathan Vaughters reacted to the crash immediately on Twitter.'So sad. Nothing to be done. Professional bike racing is cruel,' he wrote. Martin's uncle, 1987 Giro winner Stephen Roche, was also on Twitter moments after the crash.'Absolutely gutted Dan @DanMartin86' he wrote. Martin, . a stage winner on last year's Tour de France and cousin of Nicolas . Roche, was considered one of the contenders at the start of the race, . but the crash left his team's plans in ruins. Sealed with a kiss: Svein Tuft collects the Maglia Rosa after his team won the first stage of the Giro d'Italia . They were able to get . five riders to the line together - the minimum required in the team time . trial - but they finished three and a half minutes down on Orica . GreenEdge's time of 24 minutes 42 seconds, surely eliminating 2012 . winner Ryder Hesjedal from contention too. It was another huge slice . of bad luck for Martin, who was on course to defend his title at . Liege-Bastogne-Liege at the end of April before crashing on the final . bend. The roads began to dry late on, allowing Rigoberto Uran's . Omega-Pharma Quick-Step team to take second place, just five seconds off .

"With the October half-term approaching, a new study from AXA has found that Spain, France and Portugal are the top European destinations to visit. But before you jet off, take heed: one in three Britons will offend the locals while on holiday. AXA has found that failing to speak the local language is the top indiscretion committed abroad, with one in ten admitting to it. Scroll down for video . Spain, France and Portugal are most popular places to visit during October half-term . A survey found that one in ten Brits do not attempt to learn the local language while abroad . Of those, one in eight (12 per cent) also tries to be understood by speaking English in the local accent. Interestingly, the reason most Brits don't attempt to speak the language abroad has very little to do with disrespect. Over two thirds of those surveyed said they feel embarrassed or annoyed when they can't make themselves understood - so they don't even try - with the most likely to speak English being those from the South East and East Midlands. And while it may seem offensive to imitate the local dialect, 63 per cent admit to speaking slowly or raising their voice in an attempt to make themselves understood, while one in 12 even resort to drawing pictures to get their point across. It's worth noting however that this tendency is more likely to be seen in men. Only one in six women will exaggerate their words or attempt a local accent in effort to be understood. Still, many travellers do take the time to teach themselves foreign phrases and key words - and it seems that manners matter most. Seventy seven per cent of those surveyed rank 'thank you' at the top of their list of phrases to learn, closely followed by 'please.' In France, a common tourist faux pas is offering to split the bill in a restaurant . It's not all bad! Most tourists will attempt to learn some key phrases in the local language (pictured: Lisbon) 'Can I have a beer please?' is deemed the most important travel phrase by one third of all men, but it seems to be more common among younger holidaymakers. Nevertheless, it's also important for tourists abroad to take note of a faux pas that can be made inadvertently - offering to split the bill in France, for example, is a common mistake. Head of AXA Travel Insurance, David Vincent, said: 'Whilst our report shows an encouraging two in five people do make the effort to learn some local lingo so as not to offend, it also reveals that a third of us have committed a faux pas when on holiday in a foreign country. 'Although no one can expect to be word-perfect in a foreign language before they jet off abroad, reading up on a few of the cultural traditions and key phrases ahead of time can make the world of difference and avoid any unnecessary embarrassment.'","Study found one in ten Brits will not attempt local language abroad .

"Not even the most experienced bookie could have predicted the odds that were to stack up against promising young jockey Nathan Berry. The 23-year-old had the world at his feet - the career, the girl and a loving and supportive family - particularly his identical twin brother - and fellow talented  jockey - Tom. But it all came to a grinding halt when Nathan was struck down with a virus, that only affects one in every million people, which suddenly and unexpectedly took his life in April this year. Scroll down for video . Identical twin brothers Nathan and Tom Berry both pursued careers as jockeys . Tom rides every race in Nathan's honour since he died of a rare virus - Nore Syndrome - in April this year . The Berry brothers were inseparable right from the very beginning of their lives . Nathan was born 14 minutes before Tom and were inseparable from the very beginning. It was almost inevitable that the boys chose a life on the race track as their parents, Julie and John Berry, run a small stable at Warwick Farm in southwest Sydney. Tom's career took off before his brother's did but there was never a hint of sibling rivalry as Nathan remained his number one supporter. 'I tear up when it talk about Nathan because hes the biggest part of my career,' Tom told 60 Minutes. 'The relationship that twins have - twins will only ever understand.' But in January this year, Nathan's career rose to new heights when he won the Magic Millions on the Gold Coast in Queensland and he landed a lucrative contract in Singapore. Not to mention that he was also getting ready to marry his childhood sweetheart - Whitney. Nathan was Tom's number one supporter before his own career took off in January . Nathan had just landed a deal in Singapore and was about to marry his childhood sweetheart before he died . 'The relationship that twins have - twins will only ever understand' Tom says of his relationship with Nathan . Berry boys: Just like two peas in a pod . Just when life could not have been looking any better, Nathan developed the extremely rare virus, Nore Syndrome, which destroys the brain through constant seizures. One night during his illness, Tom thought it was looking like his brother was going to pull through when Nathan opened his eyes and began looking around. 'It was very special for all of us - it gave us hope again,' Tom recalls. 'We were doing cartwheels out the front - literally.' 'It feels like a kick in the guts now though to see that he was that close to getting better and then it dropped so quick.' His parents admitted that they used to worry about something going wrong on the track - not out of the saddle. 'That's where you would expect it to happen - definitely,' Julie said. 'We lost a very special boy - he gave us so much joy and made us a perfect family and now it's broken.' 'For a virus to take him it just shocked us - just unbelievable - we still can't believe it, John added. Tom doesn't know how he would get through each day if he didn't ride now that Nathan has gone . 'He gave us so much joy and made us a perfect family and now it's broken,' his mother Julie Berry says . No one was more devastated than Tom - but he did not let the tragedy stop him from getting straight back on the horse. Tom is getting ready for the biggest race of his life - riding Sea Moon at the Melbourne Cup on Tuesday. 'I don't just ride for myself now i ride for him and i feel that,' he said. 'I've got his name on the back of my silks which reminds me every time I put them on that he's there and I'm just so glad I can do what he loved and be successful at what I'm doing and make him proud.' Asked if Tom has given himself time to grieve the loss of his brother before getting back in the saddle - he simply said he knows no other way. 'I don't know that there is a healthy or right way of dealing with it,' he said. 'I know I'm doing it for him and it helps me get through everyday life - if i wasn't riding I don't know what i would do.'

"White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest found himself in a predicament on Monday when reporters questioned him about Vice President Joe Biden's claim last Friday that Turkey and the United Arab Emirates inadvertently armed terrorist groups in Syria. Asked if there was any truth Biden's statement, which he has since apologized for to both country's governments, Earnest hemmed and hawed and, at one point, stammered and gulped. 'The reason for the vice president's phone call was that he wanted to clarify that his recent remarks regarding the early stages of the conflict in Syria were not meant to imply that the UAE had facilitated or supported ISIL, al-Qaeda or other extremist groups in Syria,' Earnest said. Scroll down for video . 'Th -- well -- ah': That was White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest's response this afternoon to a reporter's question today regarding the truth behind Vice President Joe Biden's claims about Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the UAE on Friday . Pressed to state that the White House believes that the UAE did not provide weapons and money to terrorist groups as part of a plan to aid Syrian rebels opposed to their country's leader, Bashar al-Assad, Earnest gave an even less comprehensible answer. 'That is what the -- th -- well -- ah -- let me just be clear, that what the president, or what the vice president did was clarify his remarks to indicate that, um, that he was attempting to imply that the UAE had facilitated or supported ISIL, al-Qaeda or other extremist groups in Syria,' he said, awkwardly pausing and changing direction at several points in the beginning of his answer. 'The fact of the matter is, and again, the vice president noted this in his phone call with the crown prince, that the UAE continues to be a strong partner with the United States in this effort,' he continued, adding that the White House is 'proud' to be working with the Emiratis to defeat the Islamic State. Vice President Joe Biden told what some foreign policy experts are referring to now as the cold, hard truth on Friday when he called Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Arab countries out for their role in the growth of the Islamic State in Syria while answering a question during an event at the Kennedy School of Government. After a student asked him if he thinks the U.S. erred in it's decision not to arm moderate Syrian rebels years ago, when Obama administration officials including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta wanted to, Biden said he did not. In explaining his reasoning, Biden said: 'My constant cry was that our biggest problem is our allies — our allies in the region were our largest problem in Syria.' Biden went on to say that 'the Turks were great friends,' as were the the other countries. But 'they were so determined to take down Assad and essentially have a proxy Sunni-Shia war' that 'they poured hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad.' 'Except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra and al-Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world,' Biden added. The vice president also claimed that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an old friend of his, claimed in a private conversation that his country had in fact let 'too many' foreign fighters through. Vice President Joe Biden told students at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that Turkey and the United Arab Emirates had a role in allowing weapons and money into Syria to bolster extremist groups fighting Syrian President Bashar Assad . Erdogan refuted Biden's claim over the weekend, saying that never happened, and the vice president was forced to apologize for mischaracterizing the foreign leader's statements. In phone calls to Turkey and the UAE leaders Biden also 'clarified' that he never meant to insinuate that their countries had purposefully armed terrorists. But Biden never, in any way, suggested that the Middle Eastern countries had funded Islamic extremists by design, leading reporters to wonder on Monday why the White House had Biden apologize for that comment. Were they not true? As Politico pointed out on Monday morning, President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry had said as much themselves in recent statements. 'The truth is that we’ve had state actors who at times have thought that the way to advance their interests is, well, financing some of these groups as proxies is not such a bad strategy,' Obama said during a press conference on August 28. 'And part of our message to the entire region is this should be a wake-up call to Sunni, to Shia — to everybody — that a group like ISIS is beyond the pale,' he continued. More recently, Kerry told CNN's Christiane Ammanpour, 'In the very beginning ... when the efforts to oust Assad took place, there were people who made calculations that the important thing is to remove Assad. 'And that, unfortunately, resulted in funding to different groups, and it was frankly a sloppy process. It did not provide the coordinated, concerted effort that was needed,' the State Department official said during a Sept. 24 interview. The difference between Biden's statement and that of Obama and Kerry was that he named names, making it clear to important allies in the fight against ISIS that the administration believes they are responsible for the state of affairs in Syria. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki fared slightly better than Earnest this afternoon when asked for her agency's reaction to Biden's comments. 'We don't have any evidence of any country supporting ISIL,' she said after ducking questions about the issue for a the first couple minutes of her daily briefing. After acknowledging that her own boss, Kerry, had made a comment similar to Biden's in the not-so-distant past, Psaki said State is 'obviously focused on moving forward, and what we can do from here.' 'There have been a number of steps that have been taken, even over the past couple of weeks, by a number of these countries to do more to crack down on foreign fighters and crack down on counter financing. 'That's where our focus is,' she said.","Asked if there was any truth Biden's statement, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest hemmed and hawed, stammered and gulped .

"For more than a month, Iceland's Bardarbunga volcano has been steadily spewing lava into the air, covering the region in a blanket of ash. And while most people are being advised to stay away, a film director and photographer have not only travelled as close to the heart of the eruption as they could, they've managed to capture its volcanic activity in stunning high-definition. Using a drone, fitted with a GoPro action camera, the pair were able to record footage in the centre of the area’s Holuhraun lava field, and provide an incredible view of its violent and blistering core. Scroll down for video . The footage (pictured) was shot in the Bardarbunga volcanic system, Iceland using a quadcopter and a drone. It was captured by Eric Cheng, director of aerial imaging for drone-maker DJI, alongside photographer Ragnar Th. Sigurdsson on 20 September . Weight: 2.2lbs (1.03kg) Max Tilt Angle: 35° . Flight Time: 25mins . Communication Distance: 3,280ft (1,000 metres) Price: $1,190 (£750) Bardarbunga is a large central volcano lying underneath Iceland's Vatnajokull glacier, in the centre of the country. It contains a 2,296ft-deep (700 metre) caldera, hidden beneath ice, covered in extensive flank fissures, from where the majority eruptions take place. The most recent eruption began in August, and experts believe it could last for up to a year. The Veidivötn fissure extends for over 62 miles (100km) to the south west, almost reaching Torfajökull volcano. While the Trollagigar fissure extends 31 (50km) to the north east, towards the Askja volcano. It was in this latter region that the footage was filmed.

It took the researcher three attempts to fly the drone (pictured) close enough to the eruption. The first two attempts failed because the film crew was stood too far away, and the drone kept returning because they were trying to fly it out of range .

"British spies today admitted they can access  mobile phone and email records without a warrant - if they are handed over by American or other foreign intelligence agencies. The Government has until now insisted its GCHQ eavesdropping centre does not use information gathered in the States to bypass restrictions on the what information can be gathered in Britain. But in court documents released today, GCHQ admitted it scoops up information of 'unanalysed intercepted communications content' from its US intelligence partner without a warrant. Special relationship: British spies at GCHQ are allowed to mine American citizen's telephone calls and emails without a warrant and with the agreement of the NSA . Campaign group Privacy International said the revelation exposed 'a huge gap in protection for British people'. A spokesman for the organisation, which is suing the UK spy agency alongside Liberty and Amnesty International, said: 'The British public had been consistently persuaded by government over the last year that GCHQ are not using the NSA as a backdoor to sidestep protection in the law.' It means UK spies can help themselves to data collected by the US National Security Agency without any oversight. GCHQ - which has refused to comment - has not revealed whose phone and email records it has trawled through. The agreement between the NSA and GCHQ allows the UK to store anything discovered in the data for up to two years. But this deadline can be extended unilaterally by 'senior UK officials' if they believe it to be necessary for national security purposes. GCHQ was forced to draw back the veil on some of their top secret policies during a legal challenge to their practices following whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations about the NSA last year. Amongst the legal challengers were Amnesty International and the British civil rights advocates, Liberty. Embattled: The National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters building in Fort Meade, Maryland . 'We now know that data from any call, internet search, or website you visited over the past two years could be stored in GCHQ's database and analysed at will, all without a warrant to collect it in the first place,' said Privacy International deputy director Eric King to the Guardian. Revelations: Edward Snowden exposed the full extent of the NSA and GCHQ's surveillance on British and American citizens . 'It is outrageous that the government thinks mass surveillance, justified by secret 'arrangements' that allow for vast and unrestrained receipt and analysis of foreign intelligence material is lawful.' Generally, the UK's intelligence gathering and data sharing is governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), which generally demands a warrant for private data interception.

"A woman who was 'left with no bones in her nose' after being beaten with a hammer in a plush London hotel room has spoken of the night she and her two sisters were attacked. Ohoud, 34, Kohlood, 36, and Fatima al-Najar, 31, were all left for dead in their room of the four-star Cumberland Hotel off Oxford Street, London, after being attacked by Philip Spence, 32, a court has been told. Today Fatima has spoken of the moment she woke up to the sound of her sister, Kahlood, screaming as she was beaten over the head 'around 30 times' on April 6. The mother-of-two, who had been asleep with her children aged seven and 11 at the time, told Southwark Crown Court that she tried to stop the attack, but was then beaten unconscious herself. Fatima al-Najar demonstrates how Spence beat her with a hammer in court today. She also told how she has been left without bones in her nose after the attack in a hotel room in west London . Philip Spence, 32 (left, in red), admits causing GBH and and aggravated burglary but denies attempted murder. Thomas Efremi, 58, (centre left, in black) denies conspiring to commit aggravated burglary . Kahlood al-Najar told Southwark Crown Court that she was woken to the sound of Spence shouting 'give me the f****** money' before he hit her over the head 'around 30 times' The court was told that after beating Fatima and Kahlood unconscious, Spence then moved into the adjoining room where Ohoud was asleep in bed with her nephew. Ohoud was then beaten so badly that a section of her brain had to be removed, and was unable to give evidence in court today because she can no longer speak, Kahlood said. Before the night in question, the three women, who were visiting London from the United Arab Emirates, had spent the day visiting Buckingham Palace and the London Aquarium. They had gone to sleep in two adjoining rooms of the luxury Cumberland Hotel, near to Mayfair and a stone's throw from London's West End, when the attack took place. Kahlood recalled waking up to the sound of Spence shouting 'give me the f****** money'. She began screaming, which woke Fatima. Fatima told the court: 'I just saw him with his hand up highly. I didn't know what it was he was hitting her with. 'I saw a man just attacking my sister I just got out of my bed and went to her trying to stop him. I was saying ""What's happening, what is this?"" 'He just started attacking me, I didn't know what was happening,' she said. 'He started attacking [my left side] but I was always moving so he was hitting me everywhere.' She said he hit her 'many times' in the incident which sister Khulood said was 'like a dream'. Fatima added it was 'like someone is under the water and they are sinking - that is the way I felt'. She woke to hear her family shouting and screaming before losing consciousness for the second time, the court heard. Fatima, who had a plaster covering her nose and also wore all black, burst into tears while leaving the witness box after laying eyes on Spence. Spence burst in on three wealthy Arab sisters sleeping at the Cumberland Hotel off London’s biggest shopping street and just streets away from plush Mayfair . The women were sleeping in adjoining rooms like this one when Spence crept in to steal from them . 'The nose is broken, there are no bones left inside,' she said. By the end of the terrible attack all three sisters were left unconscious with smashed skulls while their traumatised children cowered close by, prosecutors said. The 'horrific onslaught' was part of a plan with Neofitos 'Thomas' Efremi who plotted with Spence and within an hour had withdrawn £5,000 from cashpoints using the victims' credit cards, the jury was told. Trial: James Moss, (above) 33, has appeared in court alongside  Philip Spence, who denies the attempted murder of three tourists in a London hotel . Prosecutor Simon Mayo QC, said: 'Three sisters who were visiting London from their home in the United Arab Emirates were subjected to a sustained and vicious attack as they slept in their beds at the Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch. 'Each was struck repeatedly to the head by a man wielding a claw hammer - their skulls fracturing and splintering under the onslaught. 'The intention of their attacker, say the prosecution, was to kill them.' Police and ambulance crews called to the scene described the gruesome aftermath as 'horrific'. Mr Mayo added: 'The women suffered terrible injuries, one of them even lost part of her brain'. Jurors were shown CCTV stills of Spence, wearing a brown leather jacket, walking across the four-star hotel's lobby before making his way to the the fifth floor. Khulood Al-Najjar was sleeping in the double room 7007 with her 11-year-old daughter and her sister Fatima who had arrived in the capital just hours earlier, the court heard. Their sister Ohoud slept in the adjoining double room 7008 on the seventh floor of the upmarket hotel. Simon Mayo QC said: ‘As Khulood slept in her bed in room 7007 she was woken by a sound coming from the corner of the room. ‘She looked up and saw that the door to the adjoining room was open. ‘She noticed a man was searching through her handbag, that man was Philip Spence. ‘Spence briefly walked to the door to the adjoining room before he turned and approached Khulood in her bed. He leant over her and said to her “Give me f*****g money!” ‘At about the same time he raised the claw hammer he had in his hand and brought it down on her head not once but repeatedly. Her screams woke Fatima who saw Spence attacking her sister, jurors heard. ‘Showing remarkable courage, Fatima got up from the bed and desperately tried to stop the attack on Khulood,' the QC said. ‘Spence however simply turned his attention to her and struck her repeatedly on her head with the hammer. She too lost consciousness. ‘A third sister, Ohoud, was subjected to a similarly ferocious assault as she lay in her bed in the adjoining room. 'Having left the women for dead lying In their beds, Spence collected a suitcase full of valuables and left the rooms where the injured lay.' Photos from the scene showed blood-spattered walls and white bed sheets covered in dark blood stains. Spence, of west London, has admitted carrying out the brutal burglary but he denies he meant to kill the women. The three women had come from their home in UAE to London for a shopping and sightseeing trip . Spence left Efremi's Islington home and made his was to the hotel shortly after midnight on April 6. He returned to the address following the attack, using a mobile stolen in the raid to call his alleged co-conspirator. Mr Mayo said: 'Within minutes of Spence arriving at Efremi's home, Efremi went out in possession of bank cards stolen from one of the victims to withdraw cash from cashpoints before the cards were blocked by the bank. 'in the course of just one hour the second defendant, Thomas Efremi, withdrew £5,000 in cash using the stolen cards.' Detectives found two blood spattered-jackets worn by Spence in the attack were later found at Efremi's home. They later recovered the mobile used by Spence to call Efremi, with the women's belongings, at the north London home of an alleged associate, James Moss. Spence, of Hounslow, west London, denies three counts of attempted murder and conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary. He admitted three charges of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent at an earlier hearing. Efremi, from  Islington, north London, has admitted one count of credit card fraud but denies conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary. Moss, of Stroud Green, admitted handling stolen goods. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Philip Spence, 32, attacked three wealthy Arab women in their luxury hotel .

"James Close was head of a violent group of gangsters who laundered large amounts of cash and were involved in drug dealing . A cafe owner who called himself 'Mr Santa' because he gave out free Christmas dinners to the homeless has been jailed for almost 14 years after he was exposed as a ringleader of a criminal gang. James Close, 31, posed as a charitable community man when he was in fact head of a violent group of gangsters who laundered large amounts of cash and were involved in drug dealing. In total, 21 of the gang were jailed following an investigation by the North West Regional Crime Unit that seized £1.2million, heroin and cocaine worth more than £200,000 and a sawn-off shotgun. Close courted publicity for his apparent generosity and served up Christmas dinners for the homeless. In 2009, he gave out 50 free Christmas dinners from his cafe and in 2010 prepared 150. He said: 'Everyone deserves something to eat on Christmas Day, whether you have millions or nothing. 'I'm hoping we can bring some Christmas joy to the homeless as well as elderly people and deprive families.' But he has been unmasked as the 'patriarch' of a criminal gang that would flood the streets with cocaine, heroin and cannabis. He was jailed along with 20 accomplices for taking part in the conspiracy to make millions in drug money and then launder the proceeds. Scroll down for video . Cafe owner James Close who described himself as 'Mr Santa' has been jailed for almost 14 years after he was uncovered as being the ringleader of a criminal gang . Close gave off a false pretence of being a charitable and community man, but has now been unmasked . An investigation by the North West Regional Crime Unit seized £1.2m in cash as well as heroin and cocaine worth more than £200,000 . Police arrested Close and his accomplices - which included a convicted killer - last December after a six-month operation called BinBrook. In a series of raids by TITAN officers from the North West Regional Crime Unit, around £1.2m, along with the heroin, cocaine and a sawn-off shotgun were seized. One of the gang who attempted to flee police in a car nearly hit a woman in a petrol station forecourt before a kilo of cocaine was found in his car. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Close admitted conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to supply cocaine. He laughed and joked in the dock as he was sentenced to a total of 13 years and nine months. The investigation by the TITAN unit ran for approximately six months and focused on the crime group, that were mainly based in the Leigh area in Greater Manchester . A shotgun belonging to one of the gang members, Patrick Roach, was also discovered by the police - he was jailed for 10 years of conspiracy to supply heroin and  possession of a prohibited weapon and ammunition . Shotgun cartridges from Roach's gun that were found by police in Operation BinBrook . Today Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson of the North West Regional Crime Unit said: 'James Close was effectively the patriarch of a crime gang involved in criminality that spanned dirty cash, drugs and firearms. 'He was the pivotal focus of the investigation. He is a well-known criminal from Leigh, a significant person in the organised crime network and a significant drug dealer. His group did significant money laundering on behalf of big organised crime groups . 'These men and their associates are involved in crime for the sole purpose of making money, so to hit them so hard and so deep in the pocket by recovering £1.2million - that we believe to have been amassed entirely through their criminal enterprises - is a massive result. 'It is no exaggeration to say the streets where this gang mostly operated, are much safer.' On October 30 2013, police swooped on two cars after a handover of half a kilo of cocaine which led to a dramatic chase, pictured, where one of the gang forced motorists to run for cover . One of Close's gang was seen handing over two bags on a street corner in Leigh to the driver of a Ford Transit van and when police swooped £541,895 (pictured) was found hidden in an elaborate concealment . Bundles of cash were discovered by the police from a Mercedes Vito van hidden in an eloborate and electronically controlled concealment .

Passing sentence Judge Michael Leeming said: 'As you will be fully aware, cocaine and heroin are dangerous drugs and people can die from them. The courts see day in and day out defendants that stand in the dock, people whose lives have been decimated by addiction to either or both. 'I am not being melodramatic when I say the consumption causes untold misery and degradation. All that misery is caused by people like you who are prepared to involve yourselves in enterprises like this in the hope of some financial advantage.

"DJ Hall has had a harrowing three years. The 25-year-old has endured a bone marrow transplant, chemotherapy, various drug trials and even more chemotherapy in his fight against leukaemia. But last year, doctors gave him the devastating news that there was nothing more they could do. Scroll down for video . DJ Hall, who has been battling leukaemia for three years, married his girlfriend of two years, Stephanie Lloyd, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast on Tuesday . Doctors told the 25-year-old last year he had 12 months to live and to start ticking items off his bucket list . They estimated Mr Hall had just 12 months to live and told him it would be a good idea to start ticking items off his bucket list. So he did exactly that. Mr Hall and his girlfriend of two years, Stephanie Lloyd, became husband and wife on Queensland's Sunshine Coast on Tuesday. 'I wanted to marry Steph more than anything and to get the opportunity to do it was unbelievable,' Mr Hall told Daily Mail Australia. 'If I didn't have her I wouldn't be trying. She's what I'm fighting for. I don't want to die a young man.' The couple got engaged during a whirlwind trip to Tasmania in February, but they never really made future plans to tie the knot . Mr Hall's only chance of survival is through a $600,000 treatment in the US. The couple have desperately trying to raise the funds and put off any plans to get married due to the cost . Luckily, a Sunshine Coast company called My Wedding Wish jumped on board and arranged for Mr Hall and Ms Lloyd to be married . The couple got engaged during a whirlwind trip to Tasmania in February, but they never really made future plans to tie the knot. 'The wedding wasn't an essential part of what we had to do on our priority list. We couldn't afford to spend money on a wedding when we're trying to save money for treatment,' Mr Hall said. Doctors say the 25-year-old's only chance of seeing his next birthday is a $600,000 treatment  in the US, something the couple have been desperately saving and fundraising for. Luckily, a Sunshine Coast company called My Wedding Wish jumped on board and arranged for Mr Hall and Ms Lloyd to be married. They tied the knot at Annabelle Wedding Chapel in Ilkley and had a fairtyale reception at Sunshine Castle . Mr Hall said he was so grateful for the opportunity to marry 'the love of my life' 'To get that opportunity, it means more than anything I could describe. It was something on my bucket list, I knew I wanted to do it from early on,' he said. They tied the knot at Annabelle Wedding Chapel in Ilkley and had a fairtyale reception at Sunshine Castle at Bli Bli. In a race against time, Mr Hall is now just $70,000 shy of having the money for treatment after his mother sold her property, Mr Hall sold his ute and family and friends held various fundraisers. 'Once we reach that, they can start booking in the treatment. I'm hoping that's reached in three weeks,' Mr Hall said. DJ and Stephanie met through mutual friends six months after his bone marrow transplant in 2011 . The pair travelled to Europe earlier this year so Mr Hall would have the chance to tick items off his bucket list . The unique treatment, only available in Philadelphia, will genetically modify Mr Hall's immune cells from his blood. His cells will then be grown in the laboratory before being infused back into him to potentially target the cancer cells. 'This is the only option left for me,' Mr Halls said. 'It's pretty heartbreaking. I couldn't believe it when they said this was it and it's all we've got. It was pretty devastating.' Mr Hall was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was just 22. He had experienced tight muscles and a shortness of breath, which he initially put down to side effects of the flu. Within 24 hours, doctors had diagnosed him and he started down the harrowing road of treatment. 'Physically, I coped fairly well with chemotherapy, it was more an an emotional thing though,' he said. 'When you first get diagnosed, you're very naïve. I was very confident and I didn't understand how long the road would be.' In a race against time, Mr Hall is now just $70,000 shy of having the money for treatment after his mother sold her property, Mr Hall sold his ute and family and friends held various fundraisers . Mr Hall was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was just 22 and has been undergoing chemotherapy, stem cell transplants and alternate treatments ever since . He underwent several rounds of chemotherapy and went into remission twice. 'Your mind kind of takes a turn and it can be a fairly lonely journey if you don't have support of family and friends,' he said. Mr Hall met Ms Lloyd through mutual friends six months after his bone marrow transplant in 2011. The couple travelled to Europe earlier this year to tick another item off his bucket list. 'I couldn't ask for anything more from Steph. She's always been there. No matter whether I'm at home or in the hospital, she's always there. She's been looking after me and the emotional support has been great too.' The newlyweds hope to spend 12 months in the US for treatment if they can raise the funds . The newlyweds are positive about their potential trip to the US. They hope to spend 12 months there for treatment and if it's successful, they plan to move back home to Brisbane. 'DJ has coped extremely well throughout this whole ordeal. He has been very strong and been very positive with his outlook,' Ms Lloyd said. 'It's inspiring to see someone who is in a pretty bad situation who will never give up. 'I'm terrified of losing him.'

"A Florida physician's assistant was jailed Thursday after refusing to move his car to allow a medical helicopter access to the scene of a deadly car crash, police say. James Allen, 52, first drove around emergency vehicles in the Barberville accident that left 26-year-old Tessa George dead. He then drove directly into the spot cleared for a helicopter and wouldn't move it even as police pleaded and the helicopter hovered 50-100 feet above, authorities say.

Rescuers were responding to a crash that occurred early on Thursday. George, a bartender in Ormond Beach, overcorrected after failing to turn at a curve in the road. That's when her SUV smashed into a tree beside the road, reports the Daytona Beach News-Journal. Officials blocked traffic as they called in a helicopter, not knowing if the car's occupants were alive or dead. As cars backed up, Allen chose to drive around the emergency vehicles, according to the police report, and refused to stop despite police orders. Police say he then pulled into the spot reserved for the helicopter and refused to move, officials said. Only when Allen was forced to move his car could the helicopter finally land, and even then police say Allen continued to refuse to produce his driver's license. In the end, he claimed it was because he was confused about what all the fuss was over. According to the police report, as he was arrested Allen yelled: . 'I always go around firetrucks.' In answer to his confusion, police charged Allen with failure to obey police-fire department orders and resisting an officer without violence. He was released on his own recognizance Friday after spending the night in a county jail.","Florida physician's assistant James Allen, 52, refused to comply with instructions to move his car on Thursday, police say .

"Former Liverpool centre back Jamie Carragher has told Brendan Rodgers that he must continue to select Dejan Lovren despite the Croat's lack of form in recent weeks. Lovren, who became Liverpool's most expensive defender in the summer after completing a £20million switch from Southampton, has been heavily criticised in recent weeks for failing to perform against the likes of Real Madrid, Newcastle and Chelsea. However Carragher has jumped to the defence of Lovren by suggesting he has to get used to Liverpool's style of play. Dejan Lovren has been criticised in recent weeks for his poor performances for Liverpool . The former Southampton star, pictured with Diego Costa, joined Liverpool for £20million in the summer . Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Liverpool Echo, Carragher said: 'I thought he was excellent for Southampton last season and that is the reason Liverpool bought him but every manager has a different way of doing things. 'Liverpool's full backs are more offensive and so are going to leave you more exposed, that could be something to look at because Brendan Rodgers likes his full backs to get forward. 'But when you pay that much money for a centre back you have to persist with it and get him through it. 'Get Lovren to learn your values but it is also about getting to know him and playing to his strengths and weaknesses.'

"Ed Miliband received a much-needed boost today after Labour comfortably held off Ukip in a crunch police commissioner election. Labour's candidate for the South Yorkshire police post, Alan Billings, scooped just over half the 148,062 votes cast – with Ukip's Jack Clarkson trailing in second place on 31.66 per cent. A senior Labour source said the party had 'took Ukip on and won' despite Nigel Farage's pledge to go after Mr Miliband's core vote. Labour's Alan Billings  won the election to become the new Police And Crime Commissioner in South Yorkshire today . It comes after Nigel Farage yesterday told MailOnline the election was 'nip and tuck'. The by-election – which was marred by turnout of just 14 per cent - was sparked by the resignation of Labour's former police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright in the wake of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal. Mr Wright stood down under intense pressure after an official report revealed more than 1,400 children had been sexually assaulted by gangs of mainly-Asian men in Rotherham. He was the councillor who oversaw children's services in the town between 2005 and 2010. Mr Farage had hoped Ukip would build on the party's recent by-election victory in Clacton and close second in Heywood and Middleton by getting its first Police and Crime Commissioner. The party came fourth when Mr Wright was elected in 2012 but has since boosted its vote by 20 per cent. A Labour source said: 'Nigel Farage said he was putting his tanks on our lawn. We took Ukip on and won. 'Let's see if (David) Cameron can do the same in Rochester and Strood (by-election).' Labour leader Ed Miliband, who represents Doncaster North, tweeted: 'Congratulations to Labour's @AlanBillingsPCC - he will bring experience, independence and a fresh start to South Yorkshire Police.' Labour leader Ed Miliband, in Manchester today, welcomed the election of Mr Billings in South Yorkshire. The byelection was sparked by the resignation of former police commissioner Shaun Wright (right) A polling station in Brinsworth, Rotherham yesterday, which had seen less than five voters by 10.30am . Ukip has exploited the Rotherham child abuse scandal - where 1,400 children were abused - to attack Labour . Conservative candidate Ian Walker won just 12.52 per cent while English Democrat David Allen secured 5.8 per cent. The Liberal Democrats did not field a candidate. Dr Billings said: 'In political terms it brings the Ukip advance to a shuddering halt in South Yorkshire and I think that they're deeply disappointed to do so badly. 'That's very gratifying for us because I think that if we can turn the tide here we can turn it in other places as well. 'So a message of huge encouragement for the Labour Party and absolute disappointment for Ukip.' He said: 'I'm very pleased. It's been very, very hard fought. Given the circumstances it's very gratifying that the Labour Party is able to re-establish itself in South Yorkshire as a credible force.' Mr Miliband donated money to a beggar ahead of a meeting of Labour's English Regional Shadow Cabinet Committee in Manchester today . Dr Billings rejected the idea that it was a tight contest. He said: 'We won on the first count. It could have gone to a second count but it didn't and we won.' Mr Clarkson called for a criminal investigation into the Rotherham scandal. He said: 'I want a criminal investigation. We don't want candy floss and forgiveness. We want a criminal investigation into what took place involving these children. 'And that involves the police, social services, council officials, councillors and any other agency. I believe there was collusion, assistance and turning of a blind eye, which is just as bad. 'If Mr Billings doesn't get this right, believe you me, there'll be people again demonstrating on the streets of Rotherham. They're wanting to see action.' He said the turnout was 'very poor'. Mr Clarkson added: 'South Yorkshire is a hard nut to crack but I'll tell you what - Ukip are in there now and Labour have got to be looking over their shoulder at us.'","Labour easily wins the South Yorkshire police commissioner contest .

"A rare, jewel-encrusted Cartier brooch bought in a box of costume jewellery at a flea market for £38 has sold at auction for £10,800. The gold brooch, which is covered in emeralds, sapphires and diamonds and a ruby, was discovered by an anonymous shopper at a table-top sale in Staffordshire in August. It went under the hammer on Friday, selling for more than double its guide price of £5,000 after interest from around the world. Bargain: The tiny pin, which is made of a ruby, emeralds, sapphires and diamonds, was found at a flea market in Staffordshire by an anonymous seller in August . The Art Deco 'tutti-frutti' jabot brooch has a carved ruby mounted as a flower, with blue sapphires and green emeralds interlinked between diamonds. The engraving 'Carter, London' is hidden on the side. Collectors from Paris, USA and the United Arab Emirates were all after the 'flavour of the month' jewellery item, although the successful bidder has chosen to remain anonymous. Hansons Auctioneers, in Etwall, Derbyshire, who held the auction, said it was a 'real rarity' to come across such a brooch. Collectors from around the world were interested in the rare 1930s Cartier brooch, which sold for £10,800 - more than double its guide price . Hansons head of jewellery, Isabel Murtough, said: 'Although we have sold such high-value jewels in the past, the brooch is such an iconic representation of Cartier's craftsmanship in the Art Deco period, it was an absolute privilege to be selling it. 'Despite all the television shows, it just goes to show what can still be uncovered at jumble sales, flea markets and even car boot sales. Although bargains may not be so frequent today, such exciting finds are still clearly out there. 'It's is a fascinating find and a real rarity to uncover.' She added that the pin was crafted in high-carat gold, and was expected to sell for between £5,000 and £8,000, . The pin eventually sold for far more - £10,800 - 284 times higher than the original £38 paid for it. Hansons said the jewel is from the 'vibrant 1930s' and is a 'flavour of the month among the high-end jewellery buyers of Paris, London and Geneva'. Charles Hanson, the auction house's manager said: 'It is amazing what bargains can still be discovered at car boots and local table-top sales. 'With interest from buyers in the USA, United Arab Emirates, Paris and further afield, we were delighted here in Derbyshire to give it a good send off.' Cartier was founded in Paris in 1847 by Louis-François Cartier, and the company remained under family control until 1964. It has a long history of sales to royalty and celebrities. King Edward VII of England referred to Cartier as 'the jeweller of kings and the king of jewellers'. For his coronation in 1902, he ordered 27 tiaras and issued a royal warrant to the jeweller.","Anonymous seller found the rare 1930s brooch in box of costume jewellery .

"Shay Given has labelled Scottish fans hypocrites for slating Irish imports Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy when Gordon Strachan’s squad contains English-born stars. The 38-year-old goalkeeper, capped 126 times by the Republic, has been angered by the barbs aimed at the Glasgow-raised pair in the build-up to Friday’s Euro 2016 qualifier. He took particular aim at Scotland legend Gordon McQueen, who has called for the Tartan Army to give the Everton duo a ‘horrible reception’ at Celtic Park. Shay Given believes Scottish fans are hypocrites for slating Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy . Everton and Ireland winger McGeady was born and raised in Scotland, but chose to play for ROI . Given insists double standards are at play and questioned whether McCarthy and McGeady playing for the land of their grandparents is any different to the Anglos at Gordon Strachan’s disposal. Four players in the pool to face Ireland — James Morrison, Russell Martin, Chris Martin and Matt Gilks — were born south of the border, although it’s fair to say that none of that quartet actually turned down England in favour of Scotland. Regardless, Given was unhappy at the treatment of his team-mates, saying: ‘I felt the comments were out of order over the past couple of days. They were a bit unfair as some of the Scottish players were born in England but have Scottish parents and that. ‘It can’t be one rule for Ireland and one rule for others. They are in the exact same situation, so some of the comments were a bit personal and a wee bit over the top.’ Asked if he was referring to McQueen, Given replied: ‘That’s who I mean, yeah.’ James McCarthy is a major injury doubt for Friday’s Euro 2016 showdown at Celtic Park . He added: ‘I just think there is no need to go to that sort of level. As I say, they have players in their squad as well who weren’t born in Scotland and playing for them. ‘They are the rules and every country is the same. I think it was unfair on James and Aiden to single them out. ‘You could go round every country in Europe and say there are players born in different countries. ‘But they are great players and that’s probably why we are standing here talking about them, because they [the Scots] probably wish they were playing for Scotland.’ Strachan has suggested fans can boo McGeady and McCarthy – who is an injury doubt with a hamstring problem – as long as it’s ‘pantomime humour’. Ireland manager Martin O’Neill was reluctant to be drawn too far into the debate but was puzzled by his counterpart’s stance. Ireland boss Martin O'Neill  has no doubt McGeady and McCarthy will handle any flak . ‘I’m not really sure I share Gordon’s view,’ he said. ‘I’ve been in the game a long time but I’ve never heard of gentle booing in my life. ‘I suppose no amount of pleading on the other side is going to prevent anything that might occur. James and Aiden are very fine players and I think they will be okay.’ O’Neill, meanwhile, is willing to give McCarthy until the last minute to prove his fitness for Friday night’s game. ‘We’ll play it day by day with James,’ said O’Neill. ‘It’s only less than 48 hours since he had a strain and we’ll see how he is . ‘He’s played a lot of games as Everton are also involved heavily in the Europa League. I think it’s one of those situations where you really would have to wait until the last minute.’ Striker Kevin Doyle was ruled out Ireland yesterday but O’Neill is hopeful Burnley left-back Stephen Ward will be available.","Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy were both born in Scotland .

"A Melbourne school student was seen pleading with two train ticket inspectors who had pinned him down over a fence for three minutes on Wednesday. Footage of the incident, which occurred at Windsor Station in Melbourne's south-east, was recorded by witnesses and shows the two Metro Officers holding down the student from either side over a low brick wall at about 8:30am. 'Can you f****** stop pinning my arm? You're breaking my arm,' the teenager, who was believed to have been wearing a private school uniform, is heard screaming. Scroll down for video . A Melbourne student was seen pinned to a wall by two ticket inspectors at a Melbourne train station on Wednesday morning . He then repeatedly asks: 'let me stand up at least,' before one man answers 'no'. 'You've already bloody resisted arrest,' the inspector is heard saying, and 'you presented a risk to us.' Witnesses told Channel Nine news that the physical dispute occurred after the teenage boy allegedly evaded the inspectors three times following an apparent disagreement regarding his fare. 'I saw him try and jump over the fence and they pulled him back; they were holding and grabbing him,' another student said, adding 'I think they took it too far'. He could be heard yelling 'let me stand up at least' while one inspector is heard saying 'No, you've already bloody resisted arrest' 'What the **** have I done? Jack ****, I've done Jack ****, alright? I've done Jack **** so get your ******* hands off me,' the student is heard saying. 'No I don't have any weapons on me you dumb ****,' he adds after being questioned. Held at an awkward angle with his lower back on the wall while his upper back hung over the edge, the boy could be seen thrashing his legs around while the officers maintained their hold on him. The video, which was recorded by a 32-year-old man according to The Age, was uploaded onto Youtube where it has been viewed more than 2000 times since being uploaded in the morning. The video was recorded by a 32-year-old man who posted it to Youtube, writing 'Absolutely disgusting use of force by transit officers' 'Absolutely disgusting use of force by transit officers this morning at Windsor Station on a school kid that HAD a Myki,' the man who recorded the footage wrote.

"England right back Kyle Walker has returned to Tottenham training after eight months out with an abdominal injury. The 24-year-old, capped 10 times by the Three Lions, has not featured for Spurs since the first leg of the Europa League last-16 clash with Benfica on March 13. The abdominal issue resulted in Walker missing out on England's World Cup squad and saw him undergo lower abdominal surgery in September - a move the north Londoners had initially hoped to avoid.

'I'm taking it one step at a time, doing things correctly as I've been told and I'll see where I am in a couple of weeks. 'Everything is good at the moment. I'll be even happier when I'm back playing but that's the final step.' Walker's return to action will be boost for country and, in particular, club, who have struggled under head coach Mauricio Pochettino this term.

"A lorry driver narrowly escaped serious injury when the cement mixer he was driving was swallowed up by a massive sinkhole that appeared in the road. Adam Zubarev, 47, had been heading to a building site in the city of Voronezh in western Russia's Voronezh Oblast when he suddenly came to an abrupt stop after the ground collapsed underneath him. He said: 'I was travelling pretty fast when suddenly I felt the truck bump as if it had hit something and come to a stop, which sent me flying forward. I had absolutely no idea what had happened but then it started lifting in the air and suddenly I was looking at the sky. I opened the door and jumped out as quickly as possible and realised that almost the entire lorry had vanished into a hole in the ground.' Scroll down for video . The massive cement mixer was swallowed by the sinkhole in Voronezh, western Russia . Driver Adam Zubarev said he had been driving quite quickly when he suddenly felt a bump . The truck was filled with quick-drying concrete which hardened as soon as the vehicle's drum stopped turning . What is more, the cement mixer was filled with quick drying cement that because it was no longer turning had started to harden, and by the time rescue workers had arrived with a crane it was impossible to save the load. He said: 'It was a shame, I reckon the load would have gone some way towards filling the hole although it was pretty big.' Police spokesman Jaroslav Yefremov said: 'The truck which was a ""Kamaz"" cement mixer vanished into a hole in the ground at the point with the road runs alongside the river outside the Marksimir shopping centre.

In total it was in the ground for almost two days. Yefremov said: 'We couldn't risk putting up a crane until we had tested the rest of the ground to make sure there weren't any other surprises.'

"To highlight the current Movember campaign, former Head of Sport at the Daily Mail, Bryan Cooney, interviewed fellow prostate cancer sufferer, Scotland legend Denis Law. Here, Cooney reveals the illuminating results. There's no discernible reluctance in Denis Law to recall one of the most embarrassing own goals in medical history. He whisks you back to 2003 and a doctor’s consulting room. He’s there at the behest of an anxious wife; he’s experiencing a troublesome ache in the lower abdomen. The biopsies have been performed and now, three agonising weeks later, the specialist delivers a sombre conclusion. The football legend has prostate cancer. Law becomes a man in torment. He swoons. Embarrassing, or what? Former Manchester United striker Denis Law has opened up about being diagnosed with prostate cancer . He delivers his recollections with a nervous laugh, but if he experienced humiliation that day, the scar is not evident. ‘I think that they thought in there that I’d had a heart attack. Because, as soon as he told me, I said I didn’t feel well. ‘Hey, I wasn’t laughing at the time. I obviously conked out. Fainted. I was completely out. It’s the Law Family trait that we don’t like hearing bad news.’ This interview with the Lawman is being filmed courtesy of the Movember campaign. It pursues a certain logic: two Aberdonians, who once lived less than a mile apart, locked into an insidious common denominator; one victim of prostate cancer being quizzed by another. Law is the epitome of punctuality. Right on the appointed hour of noon, he steps into the capacious lounge of the Northenden Golf Club. It’s a holiday home to him, a place where he can be himself. The last time we met here he was in proletariat mode, demolishing sausage, egg and chips. Time tends to blur memories, of course, but he’s far more amenable now. At that time, he was about to launch another autobiography and figured that too much compliance with me would somehow inhibit sales. This time he is generosity itself. Law (left) discusses being diagnosed with prostate cancer with Bryan Cooney (right) Now, he finds himself in a penalty box he never infiltrated in his playing days when he scored more than 250 goals, most of them for Manchester United. This one delineates the grey area between life and death. It tends to focus minds. Let’s return, for one moment, to that display in the doctor’s surgery and consider the paradoxes at work here. In spite of his apparently flimsy body structure, Law was an authentic tough hombre who, for two decades, defied the various malignancies of footballers trying to break him physically and psychologically. Ignoring the height and physical superiority of his tormentors, he’d laugh in their faces when he was kicked, mentally consulting his diary and pencilling in a painful retribution. This was rarely delayed. A few decades later, he keels over at a medical diagnosis. It scarcely equates with reason. Mind you, he has always been two distinct and enigmatic personages. Away from football, he remains one of the most self effacing men on the planet. Whenever he attends an official function, for instance, he always asks a companion to accompany him to the toilet just in case he is claimed by hero-worshiping fans. He doesn’t favour fuss. The pair have been treated for prostate cancer and the video encourages men to get involved with Movember . In contrast, on the professional field of his dreams, he seemed to encourage it. Here, the message was all about theatrics and melodrama. We return to that consulting room. The man has emerged from the swoon, but the landscape is, if anything, grimmer and more industrial as ever. He is presented with a list of options. Radiotherapy is mooted. The trouble is if this does not demolish the tumour, then he can’t have the operation known as a radical prostatectomy. So that’s delete. There’s another form of treatment that he doesn’t even wish to talk about. So that’s discarded. He opts for an appointment with the knife. ‘I’d rather get rid of whatever I’ve got,’ he says. You can see he’s reliving the moment: he’s wringing his hands so hard that you expect to see water emerge at any time. ‘We’re all cowards, men.’ We return to the emotional front. Certainly, mine were scattered after my operation. One day, in intensive care and attached to myriad tubes, I’m laughing hysterically at the incongruity of it all; the next, I’m sobbing my heart out after listening to some poignant music. I only stop when I remember the words of an old newspaper boss of mine about never showing emotion. Manchester United boss Sir Matt Busby pours champagne for Denis Law after winning the First Division title . Busby with Law (L-R), Tony Dunne, Billy Foulkes, Bobby Noble, Alex Stepney, David Sadler and George Best . I notice Law’s eyes are glistening. ‘Hey, (initially) you think you’re not going to see the family again - the grandchildren. For me, initially, it was the end of the world. Why me? Then you find out you’re not alone any more. There are thousands (like you). You put things into perspective. ‘You look at others and know that you’re not too bad. But, as I say, it’s not easy to be unemotional, Cancer? Jesus! What is this?’ And what about the possible diminishment of sexual activity? He brushes this aside as if it were mere dust on the mantelpiece. ‘Don’t forget, I had five children. So things were not in that other part of the world the important thing. The importance had to be to get back into a healthy state and return into a normal life.’ Law and I are at different places with the illness. I’ve had the surgery and the radiotherapy, and next week I start the hormone treatment. Law, at 74 four years my senior, seems to be managing the disease that bit better. I sincerely hope his situation doesn’t change. Legends come. Legends go. Denis Law, hopefully, is going nowhere.

Gus Poyet said he expects to remain at Sunderland next season as the club’s fans made their feelings known by chanting his name despite a home defeat by Swansea. Most of the 45,000 spectators at the Stadium of Light stayed behind after the final whistle to serenade Poyet as he led his players on their lap of appreciation following a miraculous escape from relegation. Sunderland were seven points adrift of safety just four weeks ago but then took 13 points of 15 including wins at Chelsea and Manchester United to put Poyet on the radar of West Ham and Spurs, both of whom could have managerial vacancies this summer. Poyet does want assurances from Sunderland chairman Ellis Short about rebuilding the team over the summer to avoid another relegation fight next term.

"Australia is heading for a scorching summer, as average monthly temperatures continue to rise. Spring's warm weather is an indicator of Australia's sizzling Summer, despite the wild tropical storms that occurred across Australia's south-east on Sunday and Monday. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2014 is expected to break the current record for the hottest year world-wide, which means temperatures in Australia are only expected to rise. Scroll down for video . Australia is heading for a scorching summer, as average monthly temperatures continue to rise . 2014 is expected to break the current record for the hottest year world-wide, which means temperatures in Australia are only expected to rise . Recently, towns in north-western New South Wales encountered their first 40-degree Spring day this year, while Tibooburra, in far north-west NSW, broke the record for hottest day in 100 years, The Sydney Morning Herald reports. Sydney's temperatures are expected to surge past 31 degrees this weekend, with thunderstorms developing throughout the day. Other capital cities, Melbourne, Brisbane, Darwin, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth, will reach highs of 30 degrees over the week. Meanwhile, wild weather has caused chaos across Australia's southern states with an electrical storm taking over the sky and a lightening bolt blowing apart a Melbourne home. Wild weather has caused chaos across Australia's southern states with an electrical storm taking over the sky in Adelaide on Sunday night . Severe weather warnings were issued as thunderstorms swept across South Australia and Victoria late on Sunday, with the electrical storm causing thousands of homes to lose power and major delays to public transport. Around 3000 homes in Sydney's west lost power on Monday evening, after winds brought down power-lines and trees, Nine News reports. In Paddington, east of Sydney, a tree collapsed and crushed several cars from the strong winds that  occurred during the day. Across Sydney, State Emergency Service crews assisted  40 different wild weather reports. A family were forced to flee their home in Prahran, south-east of Melbourne's CBD, early on Monday morning after a lightening strike started a fire. Severe weather warnings were issued as thunderstorms swept across South Australia . The family of five were woken by the fierce electrical storm about 2am before they heard a loud crash, smelt smoke and saw their home going up in flames. It took about two hours to contain the blaze as neighbouring houses were forced to evacuate. A witness, Andrew, told 3AW the fire looked 'very fierce'. 'We all thought lightning actually went through the house because it was blown apart,' he said. The incredible lightening strikes sent social media into a frenzy with a number of photos capturing the bolts . Severe weather warnings were issued for several areas, including Eastern Eyre Peninsula, Lower Eyre Peninsula and parts of the West Coast . Despite the fierce lightening, rainfall across South Australia was brief . The thunderstorms brought a cool change and pushed down the forecast for Adelaide to a max of 20 degrees . It's understood the lightening strike hit a tree and started the fire, which subsequently spread into the attic of the home. But despite the severe storms that lashed parts of central Victoria, the State Emergency Service received less than 10 calls for assistance overnight. The fierce storm originated in South Australia on Sunday afternoon where severe weather warnings were issued for several areas in the south and south-east. The Bureau of Meteorology downgraded the severe thunderstorm warning over South Australia early on Monday morning . Despite the electrical storm on Sunday, Adelaide was only expecting a slight chance of a shower on Monday . Possible showers were expected to continue into Monday . The SES has advised people to keep clear of fallen power lines and beware of fallen trees or debris . BoM issued a strong wind warning on Monday for several areas in South Australia, including Adelaide Metropolitan Waters, Central Coast, South Central Coast, Spencer Gulf and Gulf St Vincent . Gusts of up to 90 km/h were expected across parts of South Australia overnight . Social media users commented it was the most lightening they have ever seen . The Bureau of Meteorology downgraded the severe thunderstorm warning over South Australia early on Monday morning but rain was expected to continue. The SES has advised people to keep clear of fallen power lines, beware of fallen trees or debris, don't drive or walk through flood water and keep clear of creeks and storm drains. Weather conditions in Victoria are expected to calm, with the BoM predicting partly cloudy conditions, showers, moderate winds and a top of 19 degrees for Melbourne.

It comes as temperatures are expected to soar across parts of Queensland. Some towns in the central west are expecting temperatures of 40 degrees or more for the week ahead. In Cunnamulla, in south-west Queensland, a temperature record that had stood for more than a century tumbled on Sunday. 'We saw October maximum temperature records broken at St George, Goondiwindi, Cunnamulla, and even some over nearer to the east coast,' Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Gordon Banks told the ABC on Monday. Despite the severe storms that lashed parts of central Victoria, the State Emergency Service received less than 10 calls for assistance overnight . The fierce storm originated in South Australia on Sunday afternoon before lashing parts of Victoria . Melbourne can expect showers until Wednesday where its predicted to be mostly sunny . 'At Cunnamulla they got 42 degrees yesterday and that's the highest October temperature ever recorded there - and that station has been open since 1907.' Queensland's heavily populated south-east corner won't be spared the heat, with Brisbane expecting a maximum of 36 degrees on Monday. Ipswich, to Brisbane's west, is expected to get to 40, which is just off the highest October temperature on record of 41.1 in 1958. The Gold Coast should be cooler at 33 and the Sunshine Coast is expecting a comparatively mild 31. Sydney . Monday: Max 31, possible afternoon storm. Tuesday: Max 28, sunny.

"A foster mother of 18 children wept in the dock as she was sentenced for the manslaughter of a disabled two-year-old girl who choked on a peanut butter sandwich in her care. Wendy Leeck, 45, had been caring for Debra Johnson for 11 months when the child died eating the snack last August at her home in Saginaw, Michigan. Today she was ordered to wear a tether for three months, ordered to pay $700 fines and $720 costs, and put on probation for two years after being found guilty of attempted third-degree child abuse. Guilty: Wendy Leeck, 45, pleaded no contest to a charge of third-degree attempted child abuse after her disabled two-year-old foster daughter choked to death on a piece of bread with peanut butter she handed her . Leeck pleaded no contest in August, MLive reported. In an emotional speech at Saginaw County District Court today, Leeck, who fostered 18 children, told the judge: 'The pain of her loss never goes away. I will never be able to help another child. 'All the good I have done is gone. All of a sudden I became a monster.' At a previous hearing, Leeck described how the children she cared for had come from underprivileged backgrounds, claiming they would consume all their food and drink quickly because 'they didn't know if the next meal would come'. The day Debra died, she said, she handed the little girl a folded slice of bread with peanut butter on it as she unloaded groceries. Around 10 minutes later, the 29-month-old child start to choke. Despite attempting to pull the food from Debra's airways, Leeck could not save the child. 'Monster': The foster mother of 18 children wept as she said all the good she has done has gone now . Judge Randall Jurrens acknowledged Leeck is a 'special person' for caring for disabled children and noted the Debra's death was accidental. However, an initial hearing found her understanding of Debra's disabilities showed her 'gross negligence' in handing the child the sandwich. She has now had her fostering license revoked and has been placed on a register for neglectful parents. Leeck's attorney James Gust said: 'Wendy Leeck is not a person that should go to prison,' he said. 'I've won cases I shouldn't have won, but on some occasions, I've lost some and I couldn't understand why.'","Wendy Leeck, 45, found guilty of third-degree attempted child abuse .

"With just over a month to go until Amir Khan steps under the flashing lights and into the ring at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino, it looks like the 27-year-old is making the most of his training. The Bolton-born welterweight, who is currently gearing-up in California has taken time out of the gym to snap this photo of himself, with his bulging pectoral muscles clear signs that his pre-fight bulking is going to plan. Despite having to keep to a strenuous fitness programme, the British boxer has spent the past week indulging in some of the biggest sporting events in America whilst also meeting loved ones across the border in Canada. Amir Khan is 'ready to use' his custom made red, white and blue sparring gloves . Khan splashed out on a private jet to fly himself from San Francisco to Vancouver, and couldn't resist taking a picture of himself in front of the aircraft. Hours later, Khan posted again, this time in a restaurant with friends in the British Colombian City. Despite dining in one of the best cities for cuisine in the world, the professional boxer is keeping to a strict diet in the lead-up to his second fight of the year. Amir Khan will return to the ring in December for the first time since he beat Luis Collazo in Las Vegas in May . Khan said it was 'Good to see the boys in Vancouver' on arrival, after completing the short flight . On Saturday he posted a picture of a balanced meal of cooked meat and boiled vegetables on his proclaimed Instagram site. Over the past week Khan also posted pictures from an Oakland Raiders NFL game, before watching game five of the World Series between the San Francisco Giants and the Kansas City Royals on Monday. However, for the time being at least it looks like the 27-year-old's week of unadulterated fun has come to an end with Khan determined to reach the required load before his pre-match weigh in. The boxer poses outside the jet, on the steps and on board, as well as posting a picture of the cockpit . Although the hard work starts here, the welterweight boxer has used his credit card one more to purchase a vibrant pair of customised Grant sparring gloves. Khan wrote: 'Ready to use my custom Grant sparring gloves'. Adorned with the famous blue, red and white of the Union Jack, the gloves also have 'King Khan' printed on the top, a signature nickname which optimises the former Olympian’s confidence in the build-up to the glamorous brawl. Khan will look to win his 30th professional fight when he meets Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on December 13. Last week Khan posted a picture with the Oakland Raiders' Menelik Watson before and NFL game .","Amir Khan shows off new Grant sparring gloves .

"Every epic journey starts with a single, small step. Not necessarily from the canteen of a car plant outside Luton, but hey ho. Roy Hodgson, the England manager, is used to playing the hand he has been dealt and on Monday that meant fronting up his World Cup squad, not at Wembley or St George’s Park, or even on stage at the Cafe Royal as in previous years, but at a Vauxhall factory off junction 10 of the M1. The modern Football Association are really spoiled for choice when it comes to suitable venues. They have dramatic locations, magnificent backdrops that would speak of this fine game and its history. Instead they just go with the dough. Decision time: Roy Hodgson has named a young England squad for the World Cup in Brazil this summer . Helping hand: Roy Hodgson arrives at Luton for the England team announcement . So Luton it is. Maybe, occasionally, in a quiet corner, a man in a blazer wonders why nobody takes his employers seriously as football’s  governors and reformers anymore, but then the marketing department bounce en route to another sponsored cocktail hour and the moment soon passes. Greg Dyke, the FA chairman, announced his commission of all the talents at a lunch sponsored by Vauxhall, too. And in World Cup year, it is time again to sell England by the pound. There is a Premier Inn opposite the Vauxhall head office and the council were dredging the nearby canal of shopping trolleys when Hodgson arrived at lunchtime in a Corsa hatchback. ‘Refined, comfortable and pretty good to drive,’ What Car? says of the Corsa. Against that, it argues that resale values are poor, the smaller engines are short of motorway pace and bulky windscreen pillars obscure the view. So a mixed bag really. Much like the England team. Used to be famous for rust, but consumers complained and they sorted it out. Now there is youth, pace and promise in Hodgson’s squad, but dark memories, too. Young guns: Raheem Sterling (left) and Adam Lallana both made Roy Hodgson's 23-man England squad . Rewarded: Ross Barkley enjoyed a fine season with Everton and is off to the World Cup with England . England had a golden generation before, remember, and it turned out to be overvalued. It is the determination to reject this tainted era that has led to such clamour for Hodgson to go with youth. And so it begins again. Raheem Sterling, Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley and the rest are only getting the same publicity that once greeted Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, David Beckham and Paul Scholes. If they lose, experience suggests it will end the same way. Except nobody can then argue that  Hodgson needs to bring on the kids to solve this crisis. He did that, on Monday. There are only six players in the 23 who have gone to a World Cup finals tournament yet Hodgson is far from gambling. The debate over Shaw versus Ashley Cole aside, there is not a young player in this group who has not been included on merit. These are not kids, but the best England have got. They just happen to be young. Hodgson lists pragmatism as one of his personal qualities and he has not turned daredevil overnight. Come at the debate from another direction. Remove the kids. Take out Barkley, Sterling, Lallana, even Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Who would England pick? Michael  Carrick? Stewart Downing? Ashley Young? Gareth Barry? The young players are better, the best Hodgson has available. This is no throw of the dice. This is English football, 2014. Not so golden? David Beckham, Frank Lampard, Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and Paul Scholes . The sole controversy is the exclusion of Cole at left back. Many would have him not just in the squad but in the starting XI against Italy on June 14, when a belt and braces approach may be required. Yet it is hard to argue against Hodgson’s decision to go with Shaw. He described the young players as imposing themselves on this squad and a teenager from Southampton seems a more obvious understudy to Leighton Baines than a 33-year-old with 107 caps. Bizarrely, though, having made the hard call, Hodgson spent much of the afternoon presenting the case for Cole. From a position where England had good left backs in such number that some were advocating picking three just to fit them all in, Hodgson is now in a position where if Baines limped off against Peru this month, England’s left back in Brazil would be Shaw, who has played one game, with Jon Flanagan of Liverpool as his understudy and still waiting for his England debut. Believers in Sod’s Law will already be contemplating the inevitable twang of an Evertonian hamstring. ‘Yes, I’ve heard the view that Cole would be the answer if Baines got injured,’ said Hodgson. ‘And he would be, without a doubt. An injury against Peru would make the choice of Shaw a very bad selection. But Ashley Cole isn’t really a cover player. End of an era: Ashley Cole retired from international football after being left out of the England squad . Big chance: Luke Shaw will be England's back-up left back behind Leighton Baines this summer . ‘Everyone knows what Ashley is and what Ashley can do. He is a No 1 man. When I decided Baines was No 1, I decided the next player would have to be Luke Shaw. ‘Circumstances could make the decision very good or very bad. If Leighton doesn’t get injured early on, if we go through the World Cup with him playing the majority of games and Shaw coming on and doing well, it makes it a good selection.’ World Cup rules mean that an injury to Baines before June 2 would mean a battlefield promotion for Flanagan. After that, Cole could be considered from outside the standby squad, the problem being his decision to announce international retirement after Hodgson’s rejection. Are the lines of communication still open, pending an emergency? ‘You would have to ask Ashley that,’ stalled Hodgson. ‘I would like to think so. ‘He’s a very experienced player and a very good one but do you think, when you have a player of his ability, you invite him along to a tournament on the basis that he might get the odd game? Is that the correct thing to do?’ ‘We have another very talented player in Shaw, the subject of a £27million bid from one of the best teams in the world, who has had a fantastic season and will have a fantastic future. Rolling back the years: Hodgson's England squad is considerably younger than Fabio Capello's in 2010 . ‘You can’t cover both eventualities. If you’re going to take a player like Shaw, without experience, you really need three left backs: two seniors because of injury and the other one. You can’t do that. ‘Twenty-three players did not give me that luxury. I can’t take them all. We might have been better off with Ashley, I can’t deny that. I’m certain Luke wouldn’t deny that if circumstances occur. ‘Then again, we might go through the tournament and get congratulated because we gave a young player a big chance.’ This is a second honeymoon for Hodgson and he is enjoying the changing public perception of him as a cavalier, a believer in youth. Fabio Capello’s World Cup squad in 2010 was the oldest to depart these shores, Hodgson’s, at 26, the youngest since 1958. That group, average age 24.8, contained only four players with caps in double figures and five that had never played a game for England. It was the beginning of a golden age that would see England win the World Cup eight years later. And how many of the class of 1958 were in Sir Alf Ramsey’s glorious band in 1966? One. Bobby Charlton. You see, sometimes it isn’t about kids, experience, planning or continuity. Sometimes you just pick the best 23 players and that works as well.","England have a new golden generation heading to the World Cup in Brazil .
These are the best players England have; they just happen to be young .
Roy Hodgson was right to select Luke Shaw over Ashley Cole ."
"Crackdown: 'Accidental landlords' will no longer be able to take out buy-to-let mortgages to cover their costs under a new EU Mortgage Directive . Tens of thousands of ‘accidental landlords’ could struggle to secure mortgages under new EU rules designed to clamp down on buy-to-let investors. ‘Accidental landlords’ are home-owners who have not intentionally purchased a buy-to-let property. They may have been forced to take out a mortgage to buy a second home because they were not able to sell their house, or have inherited a property while wanting to buy another elsewhere. But under the new EU Mortgage Credit Directive, Britons who fall into this bracket could be denied loans or pay more for their mortgage. A document published by the Treasury to interpret the new directive describes an accidental landlord as someone who has become one ‘as a result of circumstance rather than through their own active business decision’. This contrasts with deliberate buy-to-let investors, who will usually have set up a company into which their rental income is paid. They will not be affected by the changes, and will still be loaned money on the basis of the rents they are bringing in. But the new rules will create extra affordability tests for those who fall in the ‘accidental’ category - roughly one fifth of the 1.6 million existing buy-to-let mortgages. They will have to pass criteria in the same way as traditional house buyers. This would mean that, rather than looking at how much the buy-to-let owner would make in rental income, mortgage providers would also have to consider salary and spending habits. The rules could mean that older buy-to-let customers could be denied mortgages because they would not be able to re-pay the full amount before retirement. Rosanna Bryant, a partner in retail financial services at Addleshaw Goddard, said the new rules will cause huge confusion about where to draw the line. She said: ‘Essentially it will be looking at buy-to-let that isn't done for business purposes - “reluctant landlords”. ‘That may be people who are unable to sell a property and rent it out, or who can't live in a property because they have moved away for work, or who have inherited property. The line that is drawn isn't that obvious.’ Scroll down for video . Uncertainty: The Treasury was unable to confirm how many people would be hit by the rule changes . The changes, which will come into force by March 2016, could be a further blow for the housing market which has slowed because of changes in the mortgage system. The Treasury was unable to confirm how many people would be hit by the rule changes. Experts in the mortgage industry voiced their concerns about the new rules coming into effect in such a short time frame. Fiona Hoyle, head of consumer finance at the Finance and Leasing Association, said: ‘Firms will only have nine months to get to grips with it, and that’s not really how mortgage lending works – there is a pipeline.’ Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, warned of ‘higher mortgage rates and heftier fees’ when the new rules come into force.","'Accidental' landlords have not intentionally purchased a buy-to-let home .

"Michael Clarke admitted his Australian side couldn’t get home quickly enough after a humiliating defeat by Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. And English cricket bosses in search of a blueprint to neuter Mitchell Johnson next summer and regain the Ashes may decide to look no further than the slow, low surfaces served up for the Australians in the UAE. Having lost the first Test in Dubai by 221 runs, they surrendered the second by an eye-watering 356. It is the biggest margin of victory by runs in Pakistan’s history – and the worst inflicted on the Aussies for 34 years. Michael Clarke leads the Australians back on to the pitch after their demolition by Pakistan . Clarke (left) has admitted the Aussies are glad to be leaving Abu Dhabi after the shellacking . 1 South Africa 124 points . 2 Australia 117 . 3 Pakistan 105 . 4 England 104 . 5 Sri Lanka 101 . 6 India 96 . 7 New Zealand 93 . 8 West Indies 75 . 9 Zimbabwe 39 . 10 Bangladesh 19 . Whichever way you spin it, the chances are you’ll end up confusing an Australian batsman. ‘The players will be happy we’re going home to play in conditions we’re accustomed to,’ said a shell-shocked Clarke. ‘We’ve got to talk about what’s just happened.’ The result, which lifts Pakistan up to third in the ICC Test rankings – one place above England – means Australia have now lost 10 of their 14 Tests away from home since the start of 2013, including last year’s double whammy of 4-0 in India and 3-0 in England. And while England are in no position to gloat following their capitulation to Johnson a year ago, they will have noted with interest the Australians’ renewed struggles against spin. ‘I was hopeful we’d learned some of the lessons from India, but it doesn’t look that way,’ said Clarke. ‘The best teams win away from home consistently. It shows we’ve got a lot of work still to do. We’re a lot more comfortable playing in our own back yard.’ Clarke walks from the ground after being bowled by Zulfiqar Babar (not pictured) Azhar Ali (third right, on his knees) celebrates after taking a catch to dismiss Nathan Lyon and seal victory . Umpire Nigel Llong avoids being hit by the ball and bails as the ball crashes into the stumps . First Test (Cardiff) - 8–12 July . Second Test (Lord's) - 16–20 July . Third Test (Edgbaston) - 29 July–2 August . Fourth Test (Trent Bridge) - 6–10 August . Fifth Test (The Oval) - 20–24 August . If England do decide their best hope of a fourth successive home Ashes win next summer lies in encouraging groundsmen at Cardiff, Lord’s, Edgbaston, Trent Bridge and The Oval to produce turning tracks, it will shock no one at all. Their victory over the Australians in 2013 centred on Graeme Swann’s series haul of 26 wickets on pitches left deliberately dry. The policy had its drawbacks. Confronted by a rampant Johnson on Australia’s bouncier tracks three months later, England wilted hopelessly, and lost 5-0. But coach Peter Moores and captain Alastair Cook may feel emboldened by the progress made by Moeen Ali’s off-spin during the 3-1 win against India. Having begun the summer derided as a part-timer, he ended up taking 19 cheap wickets against a team with a reputation for devouring slow bowlers.

The success of Pakistan’s inexperienced spin attack in the UAE will do little to dissuade them. Yasir Shah, a leg-spinner playing in his first Test series, finished with 12 wickets at 17, while Zulfiqar Babar, a slow left-armer who had previously played only two Tests, managed 14 at 26. Nathan Lyon – Australia’s frontline spinner – managed three wickets at 140. Just as relevant was Johnson’s modest series haul of six. Pakistan’s cherry on the top was captain Misbah-ul-Haq’s 56-ball century on Sunday, equalling Viv Richards’s Test record.

"Six dogs have suffered chemical burns in what officials fear are deliberate attacks on the streets of two Atlanta counties. The stray animals have been admitted to an animal hospital after being found with severe burns on their backs, thought to have been caused by caustic chemicals. Veterinarians have been able to determine that at least three of the dogs were burned deliberately by someone pouring the chemicals over them. Evil: Six stray dogs have been found on the streets of Atlanta with severe chemical burns on their backs . Two dogs have been found in Clayton County and four in nearby Foulton County and admitted to Fayetteville Animal Hospital, just south of Atlanta, Georgia, in the past six months, . One dog, a five-year-old Rottweiler called Tiberius was found next to the interstate with bad burns on his back. 'Someone is burning these dogs very badly,' Penny Furr, who is fostering Tiberius, told WSB-TV 2 Atlanta. 'We don't know who it is, but it has to be a horrible person who would do that.' Erin Meurer of the Fayetteville Animal Hospital has been treating the dogs, one of them a young bulldog-mix puppy. Pure torture: The dogs, such as puppy Angel, appear to have had caustic chemicals poured over them before they have been left to die . In recovery: One of the dogs slowly healing after she was fortunate enough to have been found alive . Deliberate injuries: Staff at Fayetteville Animal Hospital say all dogs have suffered similar burns . Meurer told the TV station that although intention to cause harm could not be determined on all the dogs, the burns are similar. 'They tend to have burns running from about the back of the neck all the way down to their rear. 'The only other possibility that you could have would be like an over-the-counter flea preventative.' Three of the dogs have been pit bull mixes and the other three have been Rottweilers. Meurer says concern is growing among some animal rescue groups that these breeds are being targeted. The Atlanta television station reports that at least two rescue groups, Rotts 'n Pups in Douglasville and Second Chance Rescue NYC, are offering $1,000 each for information in the case.","Number of stray dogs attacked with caustic chemicals near Atlanta .

'I could do some Pilates, core-type exercises and more rehab. ‘When you’re away from the game, you realise how much you miss playing but I wasn’t bitter about not being here, it’s just part of what we do. 'Some people go through their whole career without any injuries, some are injury prone and I would say I’ve been fairly lucky.

"Rob Kearney has never forgotten being at home on his couch seven years ago, watching on helplessly as Ireland grimly clung on for dear life at the World Cup against Georgia. Although capped away to Argentina in June 2007, Kearney, then 21, was excluded from Eddie O’Sullivan’s squad who bombed at the tournament that September. Defeats to host nation France and Los Pumas confirmed their pool elimination after an embarrassingly-poor win over unfancied Georgia was only secured when the television match official ruled Denis Leamy had somehow managed to hold up prop David Khinchagashvili over the line and prevented him from scoring. Rob Kearney has warned against complacency as Ireland take on Georgia this weekend . The 28-year-old is refusing to get carried away with Ireland's 29-15 win over South Africa on Saturday . ‘I’d the chance of being in the World Cup squad but I wasn’t really that close to it,’ recalled Kearney. ‘The whole thing was just a nightmare, that whole World Cup, and it just went from bad to worse. ‘When things started to go a little bit wrong, it was very evident from looking at them [the Ireland team] that they were all in a huge, high-stress situation. ‘You can learn from that a little bit. It comes back to having a huge amount of confidence in your own ability when things do go bad, never getting too carried away with how bad they can potentially get. ‘I’d like to think — and I genuinely do believe — that we are a very different team to the one that took the field in Bordeaux that day. Ireland's Ian Madigan kicks the ball during the surprise win over South Africa on Saturday . South Africa's centre Jan Serfontein (centre) is tackled by  prop Mike Ross (left) and Jonathan Sexton (right) ‘You’ve probably got a better squad, you’ve got more depth. And our mental capacity for the big day is probably a little bit better; we’ve had more better performances against some bigger teams over the last 12 months. ‘But it has been stressed to us already and it will be stressed to us a lot more throughout the week not to underestimate these [Georgian] guys. ‘We’ll look at a lot of footage of them over the last few months and their players, their key players in particular, and I’m sure we’ll see guys who are more than capable of playing a really good standard,’ he added. Having emerged from a build-up to last Saturday’s Springbok game where Ireland were largely written off, despite having a strong spine available, the wildly-oscillating boom-or-bust psyche surrounding Irish rugby was again illustrated yesterday by Kearney, now suddenly fielding questions about just how good they are with an upcoming Six Nations title defence and the World Cup next year. Conor Murray of Ireland clears the ball down field during the Autumn Test against South Africa in Dublin . However, the 28-year-old is too wily to buy into the hype that has gone into overdrive in recent days. ‘I just stress that it’s just so important not to get too carried away,’ he cautioned. ‘What happens inside our team room and our meetings is very different to what goes on in newspapers and stuff. ‘Subsequently, at times when we’ve been written off, within that room we know we have huge capabilities and know we have it within us to win big games. ‘One of the strengths of the quality of players we have and the coaching staff is we all take a pretty realistic view of where we’re at that moment in time,’ he added, outlining what he considered a work-on that must be addressed despite the fashion of Ireland’s 29-15 dismissal of South Africa. ‘We didn’t get into their 22 a huge amount and didn’t build too many phases around that area that put us in a position to score some tries.’","Ireland beat South Africa 29-15 on Saturday in their Autumn opener .

"'I'm no cheat'... Sachin Tendulkar reveals shock over ball-tampering claims in new autobiography, admitting he nearly quit India's tour to South Africa . Retired cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has revealed that former England captain Nasser Hussain was the best skipper he ever played against. Hussain spent the best part of four years as England captain, taking charge of 45 Test matches and Tandulker believes he was an 'excellent strategist' despite occasionally deployed 'negative' tactics. Speaking in his new autobiography, 'Playing It My Way', serialised in The Times, Tandulker wrote: 'Among the captains I played against, I consider Nasser Hussain the best.

In his autobiography ‘Playing it My Way’, the star tells how he blamed himself for Team India's defeats . 'He was an excellent strategist and even if some of his tactics occasionally bordered on the negative - using the left-arm spinner Ashley Giles to bowl to me outside my leg stump from over the wicket, for example - he was a very good thinker about the game and was proactive. 'He would not place a fielder in a particular position after a shot was played. Rather, he had the ability to anticipate the shot and would place a fielder well in advance, making a real difference to the team. 'Nasser and Giles were counting on the fact that I would have limited scoring options off balls bowled there and were hoping to frustrate me and induce me to play a false shot. 'They has essentially given up any attempt to get me out in favour of trying to get under my skin. Mumbai-born Tendulkar, 41, also reveals that Michael Clarke was the best Australian skipper he had faced, mainly because his predecessors had the benefit of working with some of the biggest talents in the game. He added: 'Among the Australians, I rate Michael Clarke as the best captain I played against. While I was too young to judge Allan Border in 1992, Mark Taylor, Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting benefited from having some of the greatest players of our generation in their teams.

"Rob Kearney has cautioned against complacency as Ireland look to back up their defeat of South Africa against Georgia this weekend. Ireland claimed a surprise 29-15 over the Springboks, who had beaten world champions New Zealand in their prior Test a month earlier. Georgia proved challenging opposition for Ireland at the 2007 World Cup - Ireland eventually prevailing 14-10 - and that Bordeaux contest has been spoken about this week. Rob Kearney (left) congratulates Tommy Bowe after his try at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on Saturday . Kearney, who on Tuesday signed a three-year extension to his Irish Rugby Football Union contract to remain at Leinster until June 2018, said: 'Confidence is a brilliant thing and sometimes over-confidence can be a detrimental thing. 'It is key we find the balance there between the two and by no means we get carried away with one victory over a South African team who played poorly on the day and didn't really seem that the defeat hurt them after the game. 'The scalp of getting a southern hemisphere team and the confidence it'll bring to our team as a whole is probably the biggest benefit of the whole thing. 'We are very aware of just what was achieved on the day but by no means losing the run of ourselves and getting ahead of our station. 'I think South Africa played poorly enough and certainly there's a lot of work-ons from our performance too.' Changes may be required following the Springboks victory, with centre Jared Payne to undergo further assessment on a sprained foot on Wednesday. Jared Payne (left) and Robbie Henshaw impressed together in the centres against South Africa . Team manager Michael Kearney said: 'Jared is going to have further medical assessment and scans tomorrow. 'We'll know a little bit better after that. At the moment there's no detail on his chances of being fit for either Georgia or Australia.' It may be Payne is kept in reserve even if he is fit to play Georgia on Sunday. Hooker Rory Best (calf) and flanker Chris Henry (severe migraine) are unlikely to feature against the Lelos and four players have been added to the Ireland training group in Ulster - centre Darren Cave, Munster back Andrew Conway, Leinster tighthead Tadhg Furlong and Robin Copeland, the Munster back row. Best has resumed running and could be back to face the Wallabies. Michael Kearney added: 'It might be more prudent to give him a few more days to recover just to make sure he is right. 'A more realistic target might be Australia but he hasn't been ruled out of Sunday.' Veteran lock Paul O'Connell rises to win lineout ball against South Africa's Eben Etzebeth on Saturday . Ireland are determined to carry the momentum from the victory over the Springboks and full-back Rob Kearney expects head coach Joe Schmidt to make tactical alterations to front up to a Georgia side reliant on a fearsome forward pack. 'We have an ability as players to play lots of different types of game plans and we've got a fantastic coaching squad who are able to manipulate a specific type of game plan based on the opposition we are playing,' Rob Kearney added. 'South Africa and Georgia are two very different teams so I would imagine our game plan will vary a little bit. 'They're a good team and they have a huge pack. A lot, if not all of them, are playing Top 14 and Premiership rugby. Kearney gets ready to clear the ball upfield during Ireland's impressive win over South Africa . 'Okay, a lot of their backs are homegrown players, but they do have the potential to be dangerous players.' Like his full-back, Schmidt will not be satisfied with the South Africa win. 'He's trying to make us winners every single week, to improve our performance on a weekly basis,' Rob Kearney added. 'He's trying to make us that 80-minute plus team, which is something we probably haven't been a lot over the last decade or so. 'It (beating South Africa) gives us that confidence to take on Southern Hemisphere teams. 'That is huge for our mental ability going into a game, knowing we can genuinely compete and beat the best teams in the world.' The full back celebrates as Ireland score another try against their stunned opponents . The 29-year-old committed his future to Leinster on Tuesday, but had no intention of leaving to play elsewhere. 'It was always a case of staying here,' he said. 'I've no reason to leave. I'm very happy here, I'm part of two fantastic teams. 'I'm playing with all my friends and we're still competing heavily in a lot of competitions so there was never a need for me to consider moving anywhere else.'","Ireland beat South Africa 29-15 in Dublin on Saturday in first autumn fixture .

"Police have arrested a woman who was captured on CCTV setting fire to the Australian flag inside the ANZAC War Memorial in Sydney's Hyde Park. Emergency Services were called to the ANZAC memorial at Hyde Park, in the city at 12.40pm on Wednesday following reports that a small fire was lit inside the memorial building. The woman, 36, had allegedly lowered an Australian flag into the flame of remembrance causing a small fire, which was extinguished. When they arrived they discovered an Australian flag had been lowered into the flame of remembrance causing fire which was quickly extinguished. Scroll down for video .

She has been taken to Sydney City Police Station where she is assisting police with their inquiries. The woman somehow managed to evade ushers and security inside the building to gain access to the eternal flame - which is roped off. Sydney City Police superintendent Mark Walton said the woman stole one of three flags inside the building and burned on of them . Mr Walton said penalties for vandalising war memorials are 'open to interpretation' depending on the significance of the damage. Malicious damage in NSW carries a maximum penalty of five years jail.

"Ireland coach Mark Aston called for the game to provide better support for the second tier of international rugby league after watching his side narrowly miss out on the 2014 European Championship title. Aston was able to call on just two Super League players, Liam Finn and Shannon McDonnell, but the Wolfhounds ended the tournament with two wins out of three, losing only to eventual champions Scotland. The Irish, who went into the final match needing to beat Wales by 41 points in Wrexham, were leading by 36 and pressing the home line with three minutes to go only for Welsh full-back Tom Hughes to gather a loose ball and sprint the full length of the pitch to score at the other end. Josh Toole of Ireland (right) puts in a challenge on Oscar Thomas of European Championship winners Scotland . Ireland were in no mood to celebrate a 46-14 victory, which gifted the title to Scotland on the back of a superior points difference, but Aston could not have been more proud of his players' efforts. 'I've never been in a changing room like that,' said Aston, whose side miss out on a place in the 2016 Four Nations Series as a well as automatic qualification for the 2017 World Cup. 'We were outstanding. The boys have been outstanding for the last three weeks. 'We've thrown them together and they've grown. 'There's no prouder bloke anywhere than me right now. We've had a massive tournament and finished joint top having gone within a few seconds of winning it. 'As much as it hurts now, we've got to learn from it. That's what's great about sport, you can bounce back and next year we will bounce back. Sean Hesketh (centre) of Ireland is stopped in his tracks and tackled by Scotland player Danny Brough . 'Hopefully more people will start believing in international sport because it is the pinnacle of the sport and I think it's disrespected at a lot of levels. 'We need to get the game as a whole behind this tournament and players have got to play. It drives me insane that players don't put their hands up to play at this level and clubs don't support it.' Winger Brad Hargreaves, who plays for amateur club Wigan St Patrick's, scored a hat-trick of tries on his international debut, while at the other end of the age scale, Castleford's veteran scrum-half Finn ran the show on his return from injury and contributed 18 points with a try and seven goals. 'We got the massive boost of Liam Finn being available and massive thanks go to Castleford and Daryl Powell, a close friend of mine, for believing in us,' Aston added. 'He said if it wasn't a realistic target we'd probably be smarter not playing him. To go to the last play with a chance to make history is a credit to the guys.' Wales ended the tournament with the wooden spoon after saving their worst performance for last but coach John Kear took encouragement from his team's second-half fightback after they trailed 28-0. Tom Burgess of England tries to gold off challenges from Brett White (left) and Luke Ambler of Ireland . 'We've got a young and inexperienced team and I think there was a great example of that today,' Kear said.

'We've no deadline on that because it's an ongoing process and we want to get there with Welsh players. 'I've not got anything against Australian players coming into the game to play for other nations, but in Wales the only way we'll build a supporter base is with Welsh boys playing for Wales. 'Of course, money is going to be key and I'm hoping the My Club Betting deal is going to add that income for us. It's a significant sum. The potential is huge because of the profits made in Wales we will get 20 per cent given back to the grassroots of the game. So it could run into millions of pounds.'","Wales Rugby League sign record sponsorship deal .

"England coach Steve McNamara was left ‘very disappointed’ after winger Ryan Hall was denied a potentially match-winning last-minute try against Australia in the Four Nations. The Kangaroos were clinging to a 16-12 lead when Hall attempted to touch down ahead of full-back Greg Inglis with 46 seconds left. Neither Hall nor his team-mates initially celebrated and with referee Gerard Sutton not giving a try, his brother Bernard, the video official, needed ‘sufficient evidence’ — according to Australian NRL rules — to overturn the decision. Ryan Hall had a last-minute try disallowed as Australia beat England 16-12 in the Four Nations on Sunday . Hall chased down a grubber kick from Liam Farrell and felt he chased down the ball ahead of Ryan Inglis . But the referee consulted his video assistant to rule out the try, denying the visitors a famous win . He ruled that Hall had failed to find downward pressure, which left Australia celebrating a face-saving victory at Melbourne’s AAMI Park. Australia (4) 16 . Tries: Jennings, Hunt, Inglis, . Goals: Smith (2) England (12) 12 . Tries: Watkins, Hall . Goals: Widdop (2) McNamara believes the try should have been awarded and told the BBC: ‘I thought it was a try but we probably need to have a lot closer look at that. It looks like his fingers are on the ball when the ball hit the ground so we are very disappointed.’ Hall admitted he was unsure whether he had scored, adding: ‘I knew I’d got something on it but I wasn’t sure whether I grounded it or not, so I didn’t want to make a big fuss about it because we wanted the ball back at least. ‘Someone said that if it was Super League rules, that would have been a try, but we’re not in Super League are we?’ Australia coach Tim Sheens felt the right decision was made. ‘Had it been a try I think Ryan Hall would have been celebrating, but he wasn’t,’ he said. ‘They all went back for a line drop-out so I think we got the right decision.’ England must now beat New Zealand in their next game to have any chance of winning the Four Nations . A try from Inglis put Australia in command at the AAMI Park in Melbourne . Hall was in sublime form for England and scored a try of his own earlier on but it was not enough . The defeat leaves England two points behind New Zealand and level with Australia, but they will secure a place in the Wellington final on November 15 — and a potential rematch with the Kangaroos — if they win by more than 10 points in Dunedin on Saturday. It will be the first meeting between the sides since Shaun Johnson broke England hearts with a try 20 seconds from time in last year’s World Cup semi-final at Wembley. Sunday's game turned on the second-half introduction of half-back Ben Hunt as Australia, who opened the scoring with Michael Jennings’ 17th-minute try, hit back with two tries in seven minutes. Hunt touched down captain Cameron Smith’s grubber kick within two minutes of coming on for his debut and Inglis went over to restore his side’s lead. England face an anxious wait to hear if two key forwards will be available after being placed on report. A match review panel will today examine an alleged trip by Sean O’Loughlin and a potential ‘chicken wing’ tackle by Liam Farrell. England players celebrate with Kallum Watkins after he went over to score . Inglis was a danger man for the Kangaroos and here needed two men to stop him . Sean O'Loughlin of England is upended by Greg Bird of Australia during the match . Australia also missed a glorious opportunity late in the first half when Jennings got past Watkins but failed to find his winger with the final pass and England enjoyed another slice of fortune when Inglis was denied a try on 46 minutes for an obstruction. Widdop and Sarginson then combined to bring down Inglis just short of the line but the game was blown wide open in the next play when debutant Ben Hunt grabbed a try two minutes after entering the action, touching down Smith's grubber kick on the last tackle. This time Smith added the goal to cut the deficit to just two points and the Kangaroos were back in front six minutes later when Hunt and Smith combined to get Cherry-Evans into a hole and Inglis was on his inside to touch down for his 25th try for his country. Smith's second goal made it 16-12 and that's the way it stayed despite Hall's last-minute heroics. The England players line-up to sing the national anthem on Sunday .

"The European Tour is beginning a search for just the fourth chief executive in its history after the announcement that George O'Grady will step down. O'Grady, who has been with the Tour for more than 40 years, confirmed on Wednesday that he has asked the board of directors to begin the process to appoint his successor. The 65-year-old, who will remain in his role until that successor is found, became chief executive on January 1, 2005, succeeding John Jacobs - who led the Tour's formative years from 1971 to 1974 - and Ken Schofield, who took over on January 1, 1975. George O'Grady will step down as chief executive of the European Tour once successor is found . O'Grady (centre, in dark blue spotted jumper) stands with European and US players before the 2014 Ryder Cup . In a statement released by the European Tour, O'Grady said: 'In the aftermath of what I believe to have been the best presented Ryder Cup since my first involvement in the contest at Royal Lytham in 1977, I felt this was the right time to ask the board to begin the search for my successor. 'It is my firm belief that, coming towards the end of what has been another incredibly successful season, we are now seeing the green shoots of recovery across Europe and I am pleased that this coincides with all our building blocks, in terms of key television and sponsorship contracts, being in place. 'I have agreed with the board to stay not only for the time it takes to appoint a new CEO but also for sufficient additional time after that to see them properly settled in. The board also agreed that, at that stage, I will take up a role as president of international relations which will see me represent the European Tour through the Olympic Games in 2016.' US legend Jack Nicklaus (right) was given a Honorary Life Membership of the European Tour by O'Grady . European Tour chairman David Williams added: 'On behalf of the board and all of the members of the European Tour I would like to thank George for his contribution to the European Tour and professional golf generally over the last 40 years. 'The European Tour and its players are admired throughout the world of golf and George has played a key part in building global relationships and developing the Tour. He has always respected the traditions of the tour and built on the strong foundations put in place by John Jacobs, Neil Coles and Ken Schofield. 'The Tour is now embarking on a new phase in its development and that is why George has considered that it is the right time to ask the nominations committee to find his successor.' An announcement about the process had been planned for the week of the DP World Tour Championship, but media reports on Tuesday forced the Tour's hand. The Tour said no further comment will be made until the season-ending tournament in Dubai in a fortnight's time.

"Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo didn’t practice on Wednesday ahead of his side’s Wembley clash with the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. Romo sustained a back injury in Dallas’s loss to divisional rivals Washington Redskins two weeks ago, and was absent for Sunday’s 28-17 defeat to Arizona Cardinals. Speaking at Saracens’ Allianz Park on Wednesday, Dallas head coach Jason Garrett confirmed Romo’s absence from the day’s practice. Tony Romo stands at Wembley having not practiced with the Dallas Cowboys on Wednesday . ‘Romo participated in the walkthrough but he will not practice today,’ Garrett said. ‘He’ll follow a normal schedule and we’ll listen to his body. ‘Getting feedback from the player as to how they feel and how they handle the workload is really, really important. Then you come up with what you need to do during the week to get them prepared to play their best on Sunday. ‘It’s always a medical decision first. It’s always a grey area when you’re dealing with injuries – it’s never black and white.

Romo’s injury struggles and Dallas’s shaky form didn’t seem to be affecting Garrett, though - the 48-year-old spoke of his excitement at visiting London and playing in front of a sold-out Wembley crowd. ‘I have been over here a couple of times playing games, and the atmosphere at the old Wembley Stadium was fantastic,’ Garrett continued. ‘It seems like the British fan base for American football is strong. I feel like there’s a real interest in our game, and any time I’ve been over here they’ve really shown that to us. ‘It’s a great opportunity for us to come to one of the great cities and play in one of the great stadiums in the world.’ Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Gus Bradley laughs after accidentally knocking over a media microphone balanced on a cup with a hand gesture during a press conference at the Grove Hotel in Chandler's Cross .

"A kamikaze driver who downed sleeping pills and booze before smashing his car into a listed house in a bid to kill himself has been jailed for two-and-a-half years. Grant Bond, 23, even called the Samaritans before he aimed his car at the former toll house at 5.30am on August 15 last year. Pensioner Barry Lea and wife Irene were in the house with their daughter when the Silver Ford Fiesta crashed through the front wall of their home, causing £80,000 worth of damage. Astonishingly all four of them survived, Bond was left with a 'catalogue' of serious injuries including a broken pelvis. The crash caused £80,000 worth of damage to the Grade-II listed Toll House at Weethley Gate . Last week Bond, from Alcester, Warkwickshire, was jailed at Warwick Crown Court after admitting causing damage being reckless whether life was endangered and dangerous driving. The court heard that Bond aimed the car at the wall of the Grade-II listed South Lodge Old Toll House in Weethley, Warkwickshire. Bond smashed into the dining room of the listed building, injuring the owner's daughter and leaving her with whiplash injuries and suffering from flashbacks. Caging him Judge Richard Griffith-Jones described Bond as 'wicked' and told him he had put others' lives at risk. He said: 'It was a wicked thing to do. In the terrible circumstances of intending to take your own life, the way you did it was to risk the lives of others. 'His history is a sad and tortured one. The problem is that if someone in that awful position decides to kill themselves by risking other people's lives, it is a very serious crime. 'I have been able to see material about your personal history. I am not going to recite it in public, but you have had serious difficulties in your life. 'By August last year it is obvious that you had become desperate and determined to kill yourself, which is an awful position for anyone to be in. 'I don't want you to think that when I described your behaviour as wicked I am ignoring the degree of desperation you had reached, nor is it a case where you were so clear-thinking that you identified someone's house and decided you were going to drive into it, not caring about who may also lose their life. 'Without really giving proper consideration to what it was you were driving at you drove straight at that lodge. Repairs to the building to return it to the state it was in before the crash are almost completed . 'It was a wicked thing to do.' Mr Lea told police he heard a noise like a low flying bomber just seconds before the Fiesta slammed through the wall. He looked out of the kitchen window to see the car careering towards him at breakneck speed. The court heard that Bond had called police in the hours before the smash, telling them he was suicidal, but did not want to be arrested. In interview after the incident he said he had little memory of it, but could recall sobbing before slamming into the side of what he thought was an unused shop. Bond and the Lea family did not know each other. Geoffrey Dann, defending, said Bond was at an 'extremely low ebb' and that prison would just compound the problems. He added that Bond had struggled since the death of his father when he was just 15. Speaking after the hearing a spokesperson for the Lea family said: 'What is done is done, but this has had a real impact on Mr and Mrs Lea, who are in their 70s and lived at the house for 30 years. 'It is a listed building and the repairs have only just been completed. 'People say, living on a corner, the house must have been hit by cars many times but this was the first.' The building was built in the early 19th Century as a toll house . Bond's Ford Fiesta was left barely recognisable and firefighters were forced to cut off the doors in order to free the suicidal driver. The toll house is currently being restored to the condition it was in, but remains covered in fences and a protective sheet. Speaking yesterday, the Lea's daughter Jackie Hannon said the family were just looking to move on from the incident. She said: 'I don't want to say too much but the man was local to here so should have known it was an occupied house. 'But we obviously can't say what was going through his mind at the time. We all just want to move on from it now. 'The house has been rebuilt to how it was before the crash.'","Driver downed sleeping pills and booze before driving car into listed house .

"Sergio Aguero came to the rescue again for Manchester City with two super strikes but the draw left them eight points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea. Charlie Austin fired the home side ahead after having two efforts ruled out but Aguero equalised despite hint of offside and handball in the build up. QPR went ahead again when Austin's cross was headed into his own net by Martin Demichelis under pressure from Bobby Zamora but Aguero came to the rescue again with an 83rd minute equaliser. Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan was at Loftus Road and rates all the players' performances. City midfielder Yaya Toure blew hot and cold but set up Sergio Aguero for his second goal . QPR . Rob Green . Caught well, made a few good saves and looked more assured than he has previously. 6.5 . Mauricio Isla . Didn’t really have anyone to mark per se, which can be tricky for full backs. Helped Eduardo Vargas down the right to good effect. 7 . Steven Caulker . Nothing he could have done about Sergio Aguero’s first half goal. Often a spare man, he tracked the buzzing runs of Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri. Great header off the line late on. 7 . Richard Dunne . Brilliant early block to deny Samir Nasri. Even brought the ball out from the back on occasion. Heroic display - and cleared off the line too. 7.5 . Yun Suk-Young . Had the beating of Jesus Navas and was vastly improved after a bad afternoon at Chelsea last weekend. 7 . Eduardo Vargas . Again asked to play out of possession on the right, but - just as at Stamford Bridge - put in a decent shift. Has quality on the ball. 7 . QPR striker Charlie Austin continued his rich vein of form with well-taken goal . Sandro . Lost the midfield battle with Fernando, but did get himself on the ball and looked to make things happen. 6 . Karl Henry . Spoiler, and a good one at that. QPR will need Henry firing if they are to stave off relegation. Raises his game against the best. 7 . Leroy Fer . An absolute waste on the left, but has become more rough and ready than he was at Norwich last year. Decent on the ball. 6.5 . QPR midfielder Karl Henry did a superb spoiling job in the centre of midfield . Charlie Austin . Showing that he can really mix it in the top flight. Took his goal well and was unfortunate not to add more. 7.5 . Bobby Zamora . Gives QPR an added dimension. Sometimes there is no shame in going a touch longer and Zamora is the perfect battering ram. Won everything. 8 . Subs . Joey Barton (for Sandro, 46 mins) Sent on at half-time to do a job on Nasri, who was substituted late on. Good on the ball and made a terrific block in stoppage time. 6.5 . Sergio Aguero saved Manchester City further embarrassment with two super strikes . Manchester City . Joe Hart . Had an embarrassing moment in which he scuffed a free-kick he touched twice - prompting great debate over the laws of the game - but did make a collection of superb stops. 7 . Bacary Sagna . Booked for deliberately tripping Leroy Fer after being bullied off the ball by the midfielder. Summed up his evening. 6 . Martin Demichelis . Abysmal. Didn’t track his runners, failed to win his headers and looked shaken all evening. 4 . Eliaquim Mangala . See Demichelis, but that bit worse. Perhaps too soon to write the £32million man off - he is only 23 - but there is no doubt he is struggling. Can’t even do the basics. 3.5 . Gael Clichy . Got forward well, although did afford Vargas too much space on occasion. 6 . Fernando . Mixed it well with the tenacity of Henry and Sandro. Did the simple jobs well and allowed the flair players to do their thing.  7 . Fernandinho . Made a ghastly error just before the break which presented Austin with a great chance but got hold of midfield. 6.5 . Samir Nasri . Flitted in and out, as Nasri does tend to do. Dangerous around the box but couldn’t find a killer ball. 6.5 . Jesus Navas . Curious - should have been the perfect evening for him on the break but never really got going. 6.5 . Yaya Toure . Sometimes breathtaking, but often frustrating. Toure’s problems are amplified because of the quality you know he has in his locker, but a wonder ball for Aguero’s second equaliser. 7 . Sergio Aguero . He’s just too good. Give him a chance and Aguero scores. It’s 14 for the season now and his two touches in mid-air were superb to fashion the first. Where would City be without him? 9 . Subs . Edin Dzeko (for Fernandinho, 64 mins) Lasted just four minutes after picking up an injury. Frank Lampard (for Dzeko, 68 mins) Never got going. 6 . James Milner (for Nasri, 74 mins) Hit Isla flush in the face when presented with a glorious opportunity. 6 .","Sergio Aguero was man of the match with a rating of 9 .

"An 11-month-old girl in Louisiana is recovering after being trapped underneath her father's  corpse for three days. Betty Jean Fields was discovered Friday dehydrated, bruised and blistered after days spent with her face compressed against the wall as her father decomposed on top of her. Family members say Betty Jean is miraculously back to her old self, aside from some residual swelling, despite the horrific ordeal. Her father, 43-year-old Jason Fields, had previously suffered congestive heart failure and stroke. Investigators used his body's state of decomposition to estimate the length of Betty Jean's nightmarish experience. Road to recovery: Betty Jean Fields was discovered Friday dehydrated, bruised and blistered after days spent with her face compressed against the wall as her father decomposed on top of her. She's pictured here previous to the horrific tragedy . Sabine Parish Deputy Coroner Ron Rivers said he found Jason Fields, 43, dead on a bed alongside a laptop computer at the home in the small town of Pleasant Hill, south of Shreveport. He appeared to be sitting on the side of his bed when he fell backward and died. 'The fact that he fell on her and made no attempt to get up tells me he died instantly when he fell on top of her,' Rivers told the Shreveport Times. The girl's aunt, Jason's sister Kristy Fields, echoed the family's shock. 'It's one of those unsuspecting things,' she told KHOU. But, she said, at least Betty Jean is 'back to her normal self.' According to Rivers, Betty Jean is lucky to be alive. '[She] was able to breathe, expand [her] chest up and down,' Rivers said. 'We're very blessed that the baby didn't succumb.' Betty had a seizure when she first arrived at LSU Medical Center in Shreveport, but she was soon happily playing with stuffed animals, KSLA reported. Happy baby: Betty Jean, seen here prior to last week's ordeal, was bruised, dehydrated and swollen after spending three days pinned against a wall. She suffered a seizure when she first arrived at hospital . Her mother was in jail on misdemeanor charges at the time of her daughter's rescue but was released on Saturday to care for the baby girl and her older brother. That brother, 3-year-old Jeremiah Kelly, is credited with helping rescue his baby sister, KHOU reports. Kelly discovered the body and then told neighbors he thought his father was dead. No drugs or foul play are suspected in Fields' death. Kristy Fields said her brothers health had been deteriorating in the years since his congestive heart failure and stroke. 'He's been downhill since then,' she said. A funeral for Fields was planned for Saturday.

"Rangersesque. Or a timely reminder that, however wildly the oldco/newco debate may still rage in certain quarters, some things never change. When these two teams meet, there is invariably only one winner. Cowdenbeath chairman Donald Findlay weighed into the fray at the weekend with his assertion that Rangers are a ‘new entity’. On Tuesday night at Central Park, his boys found their opponents just as difficult to beat as any Rangers side in history; their wait for a first victory over the Ibrox outfit since April 1930 goes on. An early strike by Nicky Law, a Kyle Miller own goal and a late finish by sub David Templeton were enough to take Ally McCoist’s team another three points closer to the Championship summit, as they navigated another potentially tricky encounter on a cold night in Cowdenbeath, where men are men — and even the bravest are happy to wear crash helmets.

The tyre marks on the infield provided a visible reminder, if the well-worn track and the safety fences weren’t enough, of the fact that Central Park is arguably much more famous for stock-car racing than football; this might have been one of the few nights when the beautiful game attracted as many as the meat-and-potatoes motorsport action. Rangers were the reason for the bigger than usual crowd, of course. If the home punters turned up hoping to see the visitors skid and slide to disaster, the majority flocked to the stadium purely to laud the team expected — still — to win the Championship title. McCoist’s men started the night seven points behind leaders Hearts, albeit with a game in hand, and here was the perfect opportunity to close that gap and apply some pressure to the Gorgie boys. Cowdenbeath were joint-bottom of the table, level on points with Alloa, and had been conceding at a rate of over two-and-a-half goals per game. An open goal for Rangers, if ever there was, to take one more small step on the journey back to the elite division. If that sounds like a stop-gap sort of ambition, supporters have become well accustomed to this new reality by now. Nicky Law opened the scoring at a venue usually reserved for stock car racing . Law celebrates his opening goal that kept up Rangers' long tradition of winning at Cowdenbeath . Never mind the fact that this game was taking place 22 years exactly after the Champions League glories at Elland Road. The fact that they were still playing in UEFA’s premier club competition five years ago to the night, against Unirea, is neither here nor there. Rangers were here to win and, with Hearts setting such a brisk pace, any hint of a slip-up would have been reason for concern. They needed a quick start. That very thing was provided with just minutes on the clock, as the pairing of Law and Kris Boyd exchanged passes to cut a broad swathe through the inside right channel, the Rangers midfielder beating goalkeeper Robbie Thomson with a sharp, low finish across goal. Behind before they had even really got themselves into the game, Cowdenbeath might have crumbled. Instead, they seemed to discover a swagger belying both the situation and their status. From former Wolves kid Nat Wedderburn playing his way out of defence, to the force of nature that is on-loan Dundee United striker Kudus Oyenuga, the Blue Brazil actually looked a more than decent side. Ex-Tottenham forward Oyenuga caused Darren McGregor all sorts of problems, the Londoner dropping off his marker to pick up the ball and then, invariably, running at him with intent, displaying enough pace to make him dangerous — and more than a few tricks. Cowdenbeath's Kyle Miller hangs his head after deflecting in an own goal for Rangers' second . Rangers teammates congratulate Kris Boyd after his cross was deflected in to make it 2-0 . With 16 minutes gone, Oyenuga left McGregor for dead on the left, skipped along the bye-line and drilled in a low cross that required a brilliant Steven Smith clearance under pressure from Sean Higgins. If Rangers always looked to have the better overall quality in attack, with on-loan Celtic defender Marcus Fraser forced into a great saving block on Kenny Miller and Wedderburn required to make a similarly important intervention on Smith, they also had to defend. New Scotland call-up Lewis Macleod was booked for two ill-timed lunges in the space of minutes, with Rangers also riding their luck at times. This was never more true than just after the half-hour mark, as Declan Hughes showed a bit of nous on the edge of the box to put Higgins in one-on-one, the striker’s left-footed shot scudding past Steve Simonsen — but bouncing off the keeper’s left post. Rangers came close to making it 2-0 just a minute into the second half, a Smith corner from the left cleared only as far as Lee McCulloch, whose thumping low drive beat Thomson but not the vigilant figure of Dean Brett, in position at the far post to make a goal-line clearance. Rangers' Lewis MacLeod (L), who received a Scotland call-up, is challenged by Cowdenbeath's Lewis Milne . Templeton completes the routine victory with a late finish from Ian Black's pass . The crucial second came from a brilliant finish by ‘K Miller’. Just not the ‘K Miller’ Rangers fans might have expected. Boyd’s deep cross from the right was looking for his strike partner — but the defender got there well ahead of him, his header flying in off the underside of the bar for a truly spectacular own goal. The right-back very nearly made amends for his howler within seconds, forcing Simonsen into a full-stretch save with an absolute belter of a free-kick from nearly 30 yards out. But, by now, this game was heading in one direction, as Rangers eased clear of a tiring home side, Templeton making it 3-0 with six minutes remaining as he finished from a neat Ian Black pass.","Rangers moved four points behind Hearts in the Scottish Championship .

"Bayern Munich chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has urged FIFA to hold the the Qatar World Cup in April 2022. FIFA is set to hold a Qatar 2022 task force in Zurich next week as it bids to find a resolution to hosting the tournament in a country which sees searing heat in the summer months. The governing body and UEFA are pushing to hold the World Cup finals in the winter but the European Club Association (ECA), chaired by Rummenigge, will lobby for the tournament to run from late April until the end of May. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said that the 2022 World Cup should be held in April, not January or November . ECA's plan: European club's should begin their season in July 2021 and run until the beginning of April 2022. World Cup could start three weeks later. FIFA plan: World Cup should be played in November 2022. UEFA plan: The World Cup should be played in either January 2022 or 2023. Premier League plan: Changing the date should be a last resort, other options must be fully explored first. 'At the moment, there are two proposals on the table: the FIFA proposal in November and the UEFA proposal in January,' Rummenigge told The Times. 'Our proposal is a bit different. We will publish that in the next few days. 'We have made some research... and the outcome of this research is that the best option would be to start the World Cup at the end of April, finishing in May. 'It's still hot, but it would be something like 35 degrees maximum. If you then play in the evening, let's say 7pm and 9.30pm, then 9.30pm (in Qatar) is 7.30pm in central Europe, 6.30pm in the UK. 'From all points of view that's no problem. We will bring this option to the table to discuss at the FIFA task force on November 3.' Ever since Qatar were awarded the 2022 World Cup their has been considerable debate around its date .

"Guiding Wales to a major championships would be as rewarding for Gareth Bale as winning the Champions League with Real Madrid. That is the opinion of Iwan Roberts, who won 15 caps for Wales in a team featuring the likes of Ryan Giggs, Mark Hughes and Neville Southall, yet never advanced to a world or European finals. Bale, who moved from Tottenham to Madrid in an £86million deal in 2013, helped Real to 'La Decima', their 10th European Cup, last term and now has the chance to lead Wales to Euro 2016 and a first major tournament since the 1958 World Cup.

Iwan Roberts (left) believes qualification would be as big for Bale as winning the Champions League last term . Roberts, who was speaking at the filming of the new Vauxhall Home Nations Football Show, said: 'He's still only 25, but he's achieved so much in the game already. 'If Wales qualify, Gareth will have a big say, and it will be up there with winning the European Cup with Madrid for him. 'The relief in his reaction when we beat Cyprus was unbelievable. You'd have thought he'd won the Champions League again.' Wales' wait for a first tournament in almost 60 years - after a number of near-misses - could end after a strong start to the current campaign. 'There are some big players that have missed out on playing in World Cups and European Championships,' former Norwich striker Roberts added. 'We came close in '94 with the game at the old Arms Park, where Bods (Paul Bodin) missed a penalty. Bale (next to Tottenham defender Ben Davies) will have a big say as to whether Wales do qualify . Coleman watches on at the Vale Resort on Wednesday ahead of their tough test away in Belgium . Aaron Ramsey leads out the troops (with Neil Taylor behind) as they begin training in Cardiff . 'We had a great start to the 2004 campaign, when we won our first three games and then hit a bit of a brick wall and lost to Russia in the play-offs. We don't want the play-offs this time. 'I do think we'll qualify automatically. With the start that we've had, with the players that we've got, with the confidence that's flooding through the squad now. 'We've lost one in seven and that was against Holland when there was no (Aaron) Ramsey, no Bale, no Ashley Williams, no Ben Davies. 'We've had a good start.

"Southampton midfielder Victor Wanyama has revealed he was worried as the club saw a number of important first-team names leave during the summer transfer window. Having been tipped for a season of struggle by fans and pundits, the Saints have started the season impressively and sit second behind Premier League leaders Chelsea following Saturday's 2-0 victory over Leicester on Saturday. However,  Wanyama admits he was worried when a number of high-profile names moved on in the summer and told Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday: 'A lot of important first team players left the club and I was a bit worried. I was thinking: ""What's going on?"" I've never been into a club where things happen like this. It was a bit worrying.'

"Saido Berahino managed just one shot on or off target for West Brom on Sunday. Click here for Sportsmail's Match Zone! This time last year he was earning £850 per week. Now, West Brom striker Saido Berahino is among the Barclays Premier League's top goalscorers and a member of the senior England squad. A new deal in December 2013 saw the 21 year old with seven Premier League goals bump his pay to £12,000 a week, a modest sum compared to others in lesser form at the same level. There is a reason Manchester United and Liverpool are loitering, and why West Brom are scurrying to tie Berahino down to a new contract that would double his salary at the Hawthorns. VIDEO Scroll down for Alan Irvine: Saido Berahino probably had his worst game . West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino has been impressive at the Hawthorns so far this season . Manchester United and Liverpool have been interested in Berahino, who earns £12,000 per week at West Brom . Click here to visit Sportsmail's Match Zone service . But against Newcastle on Sunday, the striker found himself frustrated more often than not. Berahino started, having been named in Roy Hodgson's 26-man English squad for games against Slovenia and Scotland next week. He has Manchester United's Wayne Rooney, Arsenal's Danny Welbeck and Liverpool's Rickie Lambert to compete with for a place, and Sunday's match was an audition of sorts. Berahino, valued at £25million, was regularly pushed wide for the visit of Newcastle. The forward introduced himself  with a shot from 20 yards out after being fed by Victor Anichebe. It called for a one-handed save from goalkeeper Tim Krul to loop over the crossbar, though that would prove to be his only shot of the match. But there seems an instinctive partnership developing between Berahino and Anichebe. The two complement each other and work in tandem, even if it proved ineffective on Sunday. Berahino was offered little space and struggled to muster a chance he could call his own while on the wing, and his heat map suggests the striker found it difficult to become involved. In the end, the  youth product could not add to his seven Premier League goals, and will have to wait until after the international break to add to that tally against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. But there's no doubting Berahino's ambitions. 'My aim would be to play in the Champions League, to be involved in the England seniors and go and play in World Cups and Euros,' he admits. Berahino received his first senior England call-up from Roy Hodgson this week ahead of international break . Saido Berahino's heat map shows a frustrating day for the striker.

The rest will have to wait, most likely until he leaves the Hawthorns for a club that can offer European football. But West Brom manager Alan Irvine has a word of advice for the striker, having seen the pitfalls that younger players can fall into. 'If you keep on going about your job in that way, keep living life as you have been, then things will happen,' Irvine says. 'Berahino has the potential to be a top player. 'But like every young player, he needs to make sure he keeps his focus and doesn't get distracted outside the training ground and the pitch.' The stage is set for the potential England star.

"CLICK HERE to read the full match report from St Mary's . Southampton overhauling Chelsea and winning the Barclays Premier League is not beyond the realms of possibility, according to manager Ronald Koeman. Many have speculated on Southampton’s ability to secure European football next season with a top four finish, but the Dutchman’s aspirations don’t rest there. ‘Nothing is impossible,’ said Koeman, when asked if he had one eye on league leaders Chelsea. ‘I’m not looking too much at the rest of the teams. Maybe only in the respect that I think I haven’t seen until now teams much better than us.’ Southampton players celebrate during a 2-0 victory over Leicester that keeps them in second place . Saints manager Ronald Koeman has refused to rule out talk of a title challenge from St Mary's . Victory over Leicester at St Mary’s consolidated their second position in the table. Southampton now sit four points behind Chelsea and seven clear of Swansea in fifth. Shane Long came off the bench and scored twice, in the 75th and 80th minutes, his first goals since his £12million summer move from Hull. Ronald Koeman's 25-point haul from Southampton’s opening 11 games is the club’s best ever start to a top-flight campaign. Some fans were singing ‘We’re going to win the league’ after witnessing an 11th win in 12 games in all competitions. It is starting to sound a little less tongue in cheek. ‘It’s good,’ said Koeman, ‘it’s a fantastic dream they can have about our team and everybody is enjoying how we are playing and how we are doing, and it’s the same for the technical staff.’ This was Southampton’s seventh clean sheet of the season and they never seriously looked like conceding.

But once again it was New York's former France international Thierry Henry who proved decisive. Henry collected a header from Bradley Wright-Phillips on the left of the box, beat his man and fired in a low cross which compatriot Peguy Luyindula met with a fine, one touch finish. The Red Bulls had Costa Rican left back Roy Miller sent off in the 78th minute for a reckless high challenge and D.C grabbed a second in stoppage time when Sean Franklin fired in from close range. That counted for little, however and Henry, whose contract with New York runs out at the end of this season, continues on his goal of signing out with the franchise's first MLS Cup win.

"He was the accidental hero who stumbled upon an FA Cup and Champions League. At least, that was Roman Abramovich’s take on Roberto Di Matteo – the trophy-prone fool. For when Di Matteo triumphantly mounted the steps of the Allianz Arena, fists clenched, smile as wide as the Champions League trophy itself and screamed to his paymaster ‘I’ve done it’, the Russian returned a despairing look of ‘yes, you have, I’m going to have to make you manager now, aren’t I?’. Roberto Di Matteo lifts the Champions League trophy after Chelsea's triumph in 2012 . The former Chelsea manager is given the bumps by his players after winning the FA Cup in 2012 . How dare the caretaker extend his remit to writing history with Chelsea’s first European Cup. How dare he back his owner into a corner. His temerity was begrudgingly rewarded with a two-year deal. Within five months he was sacked. The accidental hero was now Abramovich’s intentional fall guy. Di Matteo – save for the odd charming performance as a pundit – has not been seen since. Until now. Back in management with Schalke 04, footballing fate has it that he will face his former club next month. Di Matteo forged a special bind with the Chelsea players after a difficult spell under Andre Villas-Boas . Chelsea fans were left angry after Di Matteo was replaced by Rafael Benitez at the end of 2012 . It will be two years and four days since his inevitable Chelsea axe when the Blues travel to Gelsenkirchen in their penultimate Champions League group fixture. For the away fans, it will be a chance to say a belated thank you and goodbye, rather than hello. It was Rafa Benitez who replaced Di Matteo at Stamford Bridge and, throughout the former Liverpool boss’s reign, Chelsea supporters sang the name of their fallen favourite in the 16th minute of matches in recognition of the shirt number he wore during six years as a player. The irony is, without Di Matteo’s contribution during those six years – he was integral to maxing Chelsea ‘sexy’ again – Abramovich may well have invested his roubles elsewhere. The Italian also helped his side to knock Barcelona out of the 2012 Champions League . Di Matteo acted as Villas-Boas' understudy until the manager was sacked in 2012 . VIDEO Di Matteo perfect fit for Schalke - Heldt . There were six trophies – two FA Cups, a Cup Winners’ Cup, a League Cup, a European Super Cup and a Charity Shield – during his time in West London, that silverware rebranding a club which had not won a domestic prize since the FA Cup of 1970. To that end, Di Matteo’s goal after just 42 seconds of the 1997 final against Middlesbrough heralded a new era. And what of that strike? A run from deep climaxed by a 30-yard blast which cannoned into the back of the net via the underside of the crossbar – it was a stunning reintroduction to the big stage. Di Matteo heads Chelsea's FA Cup final winning goal against Aston Villa in 2000 . Di Matteo was also part of a successful Chelsea team as a player, winning the FA Cup in 1997 and 2000 . The former Blues midfielder hammers Chelsea into the lead just 42 seconds into the 1997 FA Cup final . Di Matteo celebrates his early strike during the FA Cup final against Middlesbrough . His icon was etched in that one moment, his legend later cemented by two more Wembley goals. The first came in the League Cup victory, again over Middlesbrough, in the following season. Then, in 2000 and the last final beneath the old Twin Towers, Di Matteo scored the winner against Aston Villa. A leg injury would curtail his career at just 31 but he returned to lead out Chelsea ahead of the 2002 FA Cup final with Arsenal, a gesture in ‘gratitude for the midfielder's contribution to the transformation of the club’. Gratitude, however, was in short supply a decade on. Di Matteo is not the vindictive type to view next month’s meeting as an opportunity for payback or revenge. Rather, he will accept the gratitude of the Chelsea fans with dignity. And you wouldn’t be surprised if his players on the pitch did the talking for him. Again.

"Read Neil Ashton's match report from White Hart Lane . Mauricio Pochettino insists Harry Kane must remain patient despite the striker scoring once again as Tottenham saw off Brighton in the Capital One Cup fourth round. The 21-year-old now has seven goals for the season but has yet to be handed a start in the Premier League, despite outscoring both Emmanuel Adebyaor and Roberto Soldado in all competitions. Kane struck Tottenham's second goal in a routine 2-0 victory over the Seagulls after substitute Erik Lamela opened the scoring nine minutes after coming off the bench at the interval. Tottenham striker Harry Kane (left) stretches to beat Aaron Hughes (right) to the ball for the second goal . Academy product Kane shouts with delight as he celebrates making it 2-0 against Sami Hyypia's Brighton side . The goal for Kane, who will also have one eye on Roy Hodgson's next England squad, will not guarantee him a start for the trip to Aston Villa on Sunday as he was dropped for the defeat to Newcastle having bagged a Europa League hat-trick three days before. And Pochettino is keen to keep his options open in attack, despite a clamour for Kane to be given a prolonged run in the side. 'He shares with another striker like Adebayor or Soldado the minutes in the official games,' the Argentinian said. 'We need to understand that we are in different competitions. You demand me to play Harry Kane in every game - he played today. Soldado and Harry Kane are different players. We are in a lot of competitions.' Substitute Erik Lamela (left) slides to give Tottenham the lead against Brighton in the second half . Lamela runs off to celebrate his strike against the Championship side with the home fans at White Hart Lane . Pochettino made 10 changes to the side that was humbled by Newcastle at White Hart Lane on Sunday with only defender Jan Vertonghen keeping his place. But the former Southampton manager is still targeting success in the competition, with the Magpies their reward for reaching the last eight. 'It's realistic,' he said of ambitions to win the tournament. 'We are in the quarter-finals. All potential trophies are realistic. We are in the Capital One and the Europa League and we are happy. 'It was a good performance. We created a lot of chances and played very well. I'm happy for the players because they needed the victory. All players played well.' Brighton captain Inigo Calderon (centre) holds onto Spurs forward Kane during a corner . Mark Clattenburg will not referee this weekend, but was allowed to officiate a match on Wednesday night . Pochettino had shown a note of irritation with Lamela, who impressed after coming on for the second 45 minutes, after his compatriot was late out for the start of the second half. Newcastle's equaliser on Sunday came less than 10 seconds after the restart with Eric Dier only just taking up his position before kick-off - and Pochettino was worried history may repeat itself. 'I got angry, because I was focused and I remembered Sunday,' he explained. 'It was because when I arrived to the dressing room we knew it was impossible for (Aaron) Lennon to carry on.

"Martin O'Neill has told the Tartan Army that booing Aiden McGeady will have zero impact on the winger’s performance for Ireland. Gordon Strachan stated last week that it was okay for fans to boo McGeady and James McCarthy – both born and raised in Scotland – as long as it was purely on footballing grounds. Gordon McQueen then went much further, claiming the pair deserved a ‘horrible reception’ for deciding to represent the land of their grandparents. Everton and Ireland winger Aiden McGeady was born and raised in Scotland . McCarthy is a major injury doubt for Friday’s Euro 2016 showdown at Celtic Park but McGeady seems certain to be part of O’Neill’s starting line-up - and the Ireland boss has no doubt the 28-year-old will handle any flak sent in his direction. ‘He (McGeady) has chosen to play for Ireland, which is his prerogative,’ said O’ Neill. ‘At the time he chose, I may well have been his manager at Celtic. I have to say now that, although at the time I had absolutely nothing to do with his decision, I am absolutely delighted he chose to follow his forefathers from Donegal. ‘Remember that while the game is being played at Celtic Park it will not be made up necessarily all of Celtic-chanting supporters. [Booing or cheering] is the prerogative of fans to choose. But I don’t think it would have an impact on such a precocious kid. ‘It’s natural you would prefer people to applaud a piece of brilliance, rather than booing it, but he’s gained experience now and at the age he’s at I think he’ll take this in his stride.’ James McCarthy is a major injury doubt for Friday’s Euro 2016 showdown at Celtic Park . McCarthy will be assessed before the squad trains in Malahide this morning after sustaining a hamstring problem playing for Everton on Sunday, with O’Neill drafting in Stoke’s Glenn Whelan to bolster his options in midfield. Stoke centre-back Marc Wilson and back-up goalkeeper Kieren Westwood have been ruled out. Meanwhile, Mark McGhee insisted Scotland ‘still have it all to prove’ after claiming our qualifying results fo far were no more than expected. They have four points already from their opening games with Germany, Georgia and Poland, with their performances in each qualifier heightening the air of optimism that’s abounded since Gordon Strachan took charge almost two years ago. However, pointing to the win and the draw Poland and Ireland took from their games against the world champions respectively, assistant McGhee believes Scotland still have much to do if they are to reach a first major finals in 18 years. Ireland boss Martin O'Neill  has no doubt McGeady and McCarthy will handle any flak . ‘There’s been a lot of quite positive feedback but all we’ve achieved so far is the minimum expected of us. We’ve beaten Georgia at home, got a point away from Poland - which I think after beating Poland over there last year, people hoped we would get at least. That’s all we’ve got after we lost to Germany. ‘On the other hand, Ireland have a point more than maybe people expected, and they’ve beaten Georgia away which is still going to be a big ask for any of us. So we’ve still got it all to prove. If we can get a positive result we can start to believe we actually are on the up. ‘This is the most important game of our tenure. It’s a huge opportunity for both teams to take advantage. We could beat England 6-0 (in next week’s friendly) but it doesn’t get us to France. This is the game.’ Hearts defender Callum Paterson has been drafted in to replace likely absentee Phil Bardsley, with Johnny Russell deputising for injured Derby team-mate Craig Bryson. Meanwhile, McGhee feels it’s unlikely Strachan will agree to Ally McCoist’s request for Lewis Macleod to be ‘loaned back’ to Rangers for their clash with Alloa on Saturday. ‘Like Callum Paterson, if Lewis Macleod comes and trains all week the way Stevie May did when he came, then I’d think Gordon won’t be releasing him,’ he said. ‘That’s a decision Gordon will make in conjunction with Ally towards the end of the week.’","Scotland boss Gordon Strachan said it was okay for fans to boo Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy .

"The Tartan Army have no right to boo Republic of Ireland international James McCarthy on Friday night, according to his former Hamilton team-mate Alex Neil. McCarthy will return to the land of his birth with Martin O'Neill's squad this week as they take on Scotland in a crucial European Championship qualifier at Celtic Park. The Group D clash could pit McCarthy against former Accies colleague James McArthur - and spark an emotional tug-of-war in the corridors at New Douglas Park where the midfield duo were both given their footballing education. James McCarthy (centre) was born and raised in Scotland but chose to play for the Republic of Ireland . McCarthy has flourished in central midfield at Everton since following Roberto Martinez to the club from Wigan . Accies player-manager Alex Neil hopes the Scotland supporters show McCarthy respect at Celtic Park . Accies player-manager Neil says he will be backing Scotland's McArthur to come out on top in the next leg of the race to Euro 2016. But he has shot down any suggestion that the home support will have the right to shower Everton's 23-year-old McCarthy with stick. Like Goodison team-mate and former Celtic star Aiden McGeady, McCarthy turned his back on the Dark Blues to pledge his international future to the Boys in Green . Gordon McQueen hopes  McCarthy and McGeady are given a 'horrible reception' when they take on Scotland . Overlooked by Scotland youth selectors, the Toffees midfielder took up the Republic's offer to join their Under-16s squad. By the time the Scottish Football Association got round to calling-up the then talented Hamilton youngster, his mind was made up to stay with Ireland, who he is eligible to represent through his late grandfather Paddy Coyle. Scotland boss Gordon Strachan suggested last week that both McCarthy and McGeady could be treated like pantomime villains by the Scotland crowd, while former Dark Blues defender Gordon McQueen was quoted in several newspapers on Monday claiming the players 'deserved' to get a 'horrible reaction' for rejecting their nation of birth. But Neil - who helped guide McCarthy into the Hamilton team - said: 'I'd like to think James won't get any reaction really and that the fans will just let the kid go and play his football. Aiden McGeady also opted to play for the Irish . 'At the end of the day, he didn't get picked for Scotland and Ireland did. So it's not his fault. When you have only got one option, it's pretty easy to take that option. It's not as if Scotland came calling. 'He's a terrific footballer and I don't think any of that should have a part to play.' McCarthy was given his first-team introduction at Hamilton when he was just 15. Alongside McArthur, the pair helped the Lanarkshire outfit reach the Scottish Premiership before both being plucked down south by Wigan. They went on to win FA Cup winners' medals with the Lactics before Roberto Martinez took McCarthy with him to Everton and McArthur sealed his own switch to Crystal Palace. The best friends have already come up against each other this year in the Barclays Premier League - a 3-2 win for the Eagles at Goodison six weeks ago - but now they could go head to head on the international stage. 'To see two young lads who came through the system here go on and play at the top level of international football for their countries will make everybody extremely proud at this club,' added Neil. 'Obviously we are Scottish so we will be supporting Scotland, but I want James McCarthy to have a terrific game. 'It will be really interesting to see how the two of them get one against each other. But knowing the two of them, they are fierce competitors and they will be looking to do well for their own country. 'But I'm Scottish, so I know which one I will be cheering for.'","The Republic of Ireland face Scotland in a crucial Group D qualifier clash on Friday night in Glasgow .

'It’s likely because we have good players and we’ve worked extremely hard since the disappointments of this summer,' he said. 'We’ve turned our performances round and changed the shape slightly which has worked well for us. We’ve had five clean sheets on the spin so it’s positive. But we need to keep pushing ourselves and keep this run and the good feeling going. Cahill walks out on to the training field with fellow defenders Phil Jagielka (right) and Leighton Baines . 'Five clean sheets is something we’re really proud of. It’s something we’re pleased with and as a group we felt we needed to tighten up after the summer. 'But leading up to the World Cup we were doing well but the crunch games happened over the summer and we came in for a little bit of criticism, so it was important we tightened that up. 'I think everyone’s bought into how we want to play. We’ve changed the shape slightly and that’s worked really well for us.'

"Manuel Pellegrini’s demeanour is changing almost by the day. Usually so measured and mild mannered, he has begun to cut a very prickly figure. The pressure, it seems, is beginning to get too much. One win in six will do that to you. Already eight points behind Chelsea and staring at an early Champions League exit, the prospects for Manchester City’s season appear bleak. This is his toughest spell since taking over from Roberto Mancini and he looks under severe stress. He is third favourite to be the next manager to lose his job — behind Harry Redknapp and Paul Lambert — and was visibly agitated here as the champions offered little yet again, indebted to the brilliance of Sergio Aguero in bailing them out. Manuel Pellegrini looks on during his side's 2-2 draw against QPR at Loftus Road . Pellegrini looks strained during the second half of his side's game against QPR . City are delighted the international break has arrived — Pellegrini hopped on a plane straight after leaving Loftus Road — and will try to regroup before the clash with Swansea a week on Saturday. But problems remain all over the pitch, with a lack of invention in midfield and the softest of centres in defence. Martin Demichelis and the £32million Eliaquim Mangala aren’t up to it as a pairing. Where City would be without Aguero doesn’t bear thinking about. His goals have directly contributed eight league points from 11 games. The slump has become so worrying that Bacary Sagna called this point ‘a good one’. Curious talk from players defending a title. The City boss was very cagey during his post-match press conference . ‘There is a reason we play for City,’ the Frenchman said. ‘We want to show we can play for this team and succeed. Defensively we can do better, they created a lot of chances. Clear holding was evident with Bobby Zamora and whoever was marking him. Dean saw this and warned the players to stop. Join our campaign by clicking here. 'It is difficult to play a team in good form like QPR but we want to think positively. We lost a few games recently and it was important not to lose.’ Pellegrini is irked. He will not engage in debate surrounding his side’s dip, using the same rhetoric after each poor display. ‘I am sure we will continue to work in the same way we are doing,’ he said. ‘We’ll continue to play the style of play we always do. The team continues fighting, continues working until the end.’ The Argentinian striker celebrates his 10th Premier League goal of the season to make it 1-1 against QPR . What he will not entertain is criticism of the back four. Pellegrini snapped that Matija Nastasic, who hasn’t played a league game since February, has a ‘problem in his calf’ and that ‘we are the third best defence in the league, with one more goal than Chelsea. So be careful, we’re not so bad’. Mike Dean was correct to disallow Austin’s goal after Hart kicked the ball twice from a free-kick. Had Hart taken the kick from outside his area then an indirect free-kick would have been awarded to QPR. On the other hand, Aguero was well offside for his first goal. I felt the subsequent handball was accidental. Joey Barton, who came on at half-time for his first appearance in six weeks, inferred that last season’s title win will not buy Pellegrini any time should City’s board think about change. The QPR midfielder said: ‘It sounds crazy to say this out loud but winning the league is almost not good enough. Everyone is aware they are struggling. ‘You have to show progress in the Champions League. They have the squad to compete on all fronts. They are one of Europe’s super-clubs with the spending ability they have. Aguero stays calm after rounding Rob Green to level for City again, as the champions earned a point at QPR . 'They are not going to judge themselves against the likes of little old us. It’s going to be against the likes of Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid.’ Only Newcastle's Les Ferdinand (13 in 1995-96), has scored more goals in the first 11 matches of a season than Aguero's 12. Premier League survival may not be as daunting as Rangers had imagined thanks to the goals of Charlie Austin, who now has four in his last three. He might have added more than his one against City and Barton thinks he could be in the England squad. ‘It sounds like I am going to slag Rickie Lambert off but I am not,’ he said. ‘I just think if you can’t get a game for Liverpool, who can’t really hit a cow’s a**e with a banjo at the minute in terms of their frontline, how do you get in the England squad?’ YAYA IS A BIG HIT WITH CHLOE . Young Queens Park Rangers fan Chloe Power never saw it coming — neither Yaya Toure’s wayward shot nor his generosity. TV showed five-year-old Chloe, a season ticket holder along with her dad, being struck full in the face by Toure’s piledriver. She was unhurt but Toure rang her to apologise and arranged for a signed City shirt to be sent to her. QPR offered the five-year old girl a signed shirt and added that she was fine after speaking to her . 1.‘We’ve just spoken to the young girl who was hit by @YayaToure shot – she’s fine & will enjoy these shirts!’ @QPRFC . 2.‘Just spoke to the lovely Chloe and her dad on the phone. So glad she is OK’ @YayaToure . 3. ‘Relieved to hear the girl my shot hit is ok. I was very worried.

"Scotland legend Gordon McQueen has launched an astonishing attack on Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy – insisting they deserve ‘a horrible reception’ when they appear for Martin O’Neill’s Republic on Friday night. The pair, both born and raised in Scotland, used the grandparent ruling to pledge their allegiance to the Republic of Ireland. McGeady, who was born in Paisley, represented Scotland schools as a teenager before switching while Glasgow-born midfielder McCarthy also spurned numerous approaches to declare for Scotland, telling the SFA it was his Donegal-born grandfather’s dying wish that he represented Ireland. James McCarthy was born and raised in Scotland but chose to play for the Republic of Ireland . But McQueen insists he has ‘no time’ for players who turn their backs on the country and the former Scotland and Manchester United defender wants the Tartan Army to make it as uncomfortable a night as possible for the Everton duo in Friday’s crunch Euro 2016 qualifier. ‘Will it be hard for them coming back here with Ireland? I really hope so,’ McQueen said. ‘I hope they get a horrible reception because they deserve it. ‘You’re either Scottish or you’re not Scottish - and you should know that by the time you’re 12 years of age. I’m sure somebody must have asked them to play for Scotland at some stage. ‘But, you’re born in Glasgow but then you go and play for somebody else? I hate that! What’s that all about? I’m not having that at all. I’ve got no time for these players.’ McGeady and McCarthy, who is an injury doubt ahead of Friday’s crucial encounter, were often met with a hostile reception at away grounds when they played in the SPL. But Irish ace Stephen Hunt has warned the Tartan Army that booing McGeady and McCarthy will only motivate Martin O’Neill’s side. He said: ‘I’ve played in local derbies where there is great hatred but I don’t think Ireland against Scotland qualifies as one of those. The treatment James McCarthy and Aiden McGeady get could turn the atmosphere into something more like a typical derby. ‘If they get the reception that’s expected, it will add to the tension and I know the Ireland players will respond.’ For McQueen, his anger against the pair is solely about his fervent pro-Scottishness and although he is also frustrated by players who use the Saltire as a flag of convenience. Aiden McGeady also opted to play for the Irish . ‘I played alongside the likes of Bob Wilson and Bruce Rioch, who were born in England but they always considered themselves Scottish. That’s all I want. If you feel Scottish then you’re Scottish! ‘I just hate these guys who think “I can’t get a game for England so I’ll play for Scotland”.’ McCarthy however has emerged as a major injury doubt for Friday night’s crunch qualifier. The midfielder may not be able to feature after complaining of tightness in his hamstring following a 90-minute outing in Everton’s 1-1 draw with Sunderland yesterday. Everton manager Roberto Martinez has revealed the ex-Hamilton player will undergo tests to determine his readiness for international duty. ‘We are going to assess James,’ said Martinez. ‘He was feeling his hamstring towards the end of the game but he wanted to stay on the pitch because we had used all three subs. ‘It is a bit of a concern because he had the same injury a few weeks back when he missed the game against Manchester United and it is in that area. We are hoping that it is more fatigue than a soft tissue problem. ‘We will assess him in the morning.’ O’Neill will confirm his final squad for the Scotland game today but has further concerns over centre-back Marc Wilson and back-up goalkeeper Kieren Westwood. The loss of Wilson, who limped out of Stoke’s match with Spurs yesterday with a hamstring injury, would be the more serious blow. He has been the regular partner for John O’Shea at the heart of the Irish defence in recent matches. McQueen, who was capped 30 times and is in the Scottish Football Hall of Fame, believes that with a partisan Tartan Army behind Strachan’s side, the Scots will blow the Irish away on Friday. But he admitted he will feel ‘ashamed’ if Scotland cannot end their exile from major finals and said: ‘I think we’ll beat Ireland at Celtic Park. There are certain grounds where the crowd just gets to the opposition. Celtic have had some very average sides over the years but European teams coming to Parkhead were always intimidated by the atmosphere. Gordon McQueen hopes McGeady and McCarthy are given a 'horrible reception' when they take on Scotland . ‘As long as I live I’ll never forget playing for Scotland against Wales at Anfield in 1977 in the game that took us to the World Cup finals. ‘That was intimidating. The stadium was literally bouncing, with Scotland fans everywhere you looked, even though it was their home game. We didn’t play well that night but we still won 2-0. ‘I think Gordon Strachan is showing he’s the ideal man for the Scotland job. Right now it looks as though everyone is on his side, regardless of the results. They’ve been all right but what if we end up finishing fourth in this group? ‘Personally, I think we will qualify but I would be ashamed if we didn’t because just about everybody gets to these finals – 24 countries. Surely we can do that?’","Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy were both born in Scotland .

"Force India co-owner Vijay Mallya is expecting Bernie Ecclestone to honour his word and address the critical issue of finances with Formula One's commercial rulers on Tuesday. On Saturday in the paddock at Interlagos, two-and-a-half-hours of talks over the sport's cost crisis reached a stalemate. It resulted in Ecclestone declaring the discussions as 'a complete and utter waste of time'. Bernie Ecclestone (second left) speaks to team principals during the final practice of the Brazilian Grand Prix . Force India co-owner Vijay Mallya would like Ecclestone to address the critical issue of finance in F1 . Force India, as one of the smaller F1 constructors, may struggle to stay afloat if something is not changed . Mallya, however, claims the 84-year-old made clear he would at least speak with Donald Mackenzie, the co-founder and co-chairman of CVC Capital Partners, F1's commercial rights holders. Yet Ecclestone suggested ahead of the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday any discussions with Mackenzie would be on an unrelated topic. That came as a surprise to Mallya when informed of Ecclestone's remarks as he said: 'I know only what he told me in the presence of four others. 'He said he's going to meet Donald on Tuesday. Fine. If I don't hear (from him) by the end of the week I'll send him a gentle reminder. 'Only then will we know where we stand or don't stand, but the problems are real. The problems should not be wished away. 'He made statements in Austin (ahead of the United States Grand Prix) where he acknowledged there is a problem. He also said he didn't know how to fix it. 'In Sao Paulo he said he would discuss potential solutions with Donald. That's the last meeting we had. We just wait to hear back.' Following on from Marussia going out of business and with Caterham poised to follow suit, the remaining smaller teams in Force India, Sauber and Lotus are demanding cost cuts or a more equitable share of the sport's revenues to ensure they can survive. Marussia went out of business earlier this month, with the loss of more than 200 jobs . Nico Rosberg and Mercedes were celebrating after the Brazilian GP, but smaller teams are struggling . A report on Sunday suggested auditors had questioned Force India's recently published accounts that showed a net loss of £38.5million up to the end of December last year. Auditors Grant Thornton remarked there was 'significant doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern'. Mallya, however, has made it clear his Silverstone-based marque will be on the grid in 2015 and beyond. 'Every business has current assets and current liabilities. That's the way businesses run globally, big or small,' said Mallya. 'Do we have accounts payable? Sure we do. Is it anywhere near 45 million (euros)? Absolutely not, it's not even half of that. 'The finances of Force India have been speculated upon for a long time. 'When our partners, the Sahara group, got into a spot of trouble, there was even more speculation, but here we are and racing strong. 'All this speculation I think needs to stop. It's not doing anybody any good, neither is it doing the sport any good nor the teams any good. 'The bottom line is we're okay. We are here and we are racing.' Asked specifically whether the team will be racing next season and in the years after, Mallya added: 'Of course. Absolutely.'","There were talks at Interlagos on Saturday regarding F1's cost crisis .

Moyes took a week to decide whether to accept Real Sociedad's offer as he was worried failure in Spain could further tarnish his career. David Moyes will be hoping to bounce back from his nightmare spell at Manchester United . Jokin Aperribay was confident Moyes was always going to fill the void left by former boss Jagoba Arrasate . Former Derby midfielder Inigo Idiakez could become Moyes' number two at San Sebastian . Aperribay told Spanish radio Onda Cero: 'We had the feeling that Moyes was going to accept our offer. We had to respect his timing, he is very meticulous. 'I see Moyes as being very hungry, I rate him highly and I am very sure that he will achieve our objective. The feeling he gives me is very enriching and positive.' It is also understood that former Derby and Southampton midfielder Inigo Idiakez is in line to assist Moyes in his new job. Idiakez played for La Real for 10 years between 1992 and 2002 but is now working at the Leicester City academy. It is felt that Idiakez could be a useful conduit for Moyes in case the language barrier emerges as an issue in his early days at the club.","David Moyes is hungry to succeed in Spain, according to Real Sociedad president Jokin Aperribay .

"Real Sociedad captain Xabi Prieto claims the team are looking forward to starting work under 'great coach' David Moyes. Moyes will begin the task of rebuilding his reputation in La Liga after he was appointed by the Basque outfit late on Monday night, seven months after the ill-fated tenure at Manchester United which so damaged his standing as a manager was brought to a premature end. Moyes, sacked by United in April following a dismal first season in charge at Old Trafford, has been handed a one-and-a-half-year deal by the Primera Division outfit. David Moyes will be hoping he can prove his doubters wrong after an unsuccessful spell at Manchester United . Real Sociedad captain Xabi Preito (left) is looking forward to playing under former United manager Moyes . Sociedad posted this welcome banner to Moyes on their Twitter page on Monday evening . In an interview with Real Sociedad TV, midfielder Prieto described the Scot as a 'great coach, very prestigious' and said the team were 'looking forward to meeting him and working under him'. Prieto also paid tribute to Moyes' work at Everton and hoped he could achieve similar results at Sociedad. He said: 'It is very difficult to be at a club for many years as he was at Everton, a sign that he did very well, growing the club and qualifying for several years to play in Europe. 'We hope that with La Real something similar can happen, to help us grow, give us stability and improve the team.' Sociedad announced in a statement on their official website that Moyes would arrive in San Sebastian on Wednesday and would be presented to the media the following day. They had initially said the Scot would arrive on Tuesday and take his first training session on Wednesday. Moyes, whose contract with Sociedad runs until June 30, 2016, left United just 10 months into a six-year contract after being named as the successor to Sir Alex Ferguson in the summer of 2013. At the time of his departure, United, the defending champions, were seventh in the Barclays Premier League and 23 points behind leaders Liverpool. Moyes was greeted with a 'Chosen One' banner at Old Trafford after joining the club from Everton . The Scot follows in the footsteps of John Toshack (above) and Chris Coleman in taking charge of Sociedad . Wales boss Coleman, pictured in 2007, was the last British manager to have been in charge of Real Sociedad . Moyes also left the 20-time title winners with a host of unwanted records broken during his tenure, including failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in almost two decades. The 51-year-old, who became the third shortest-serving manager in the club's history, won 27, drew nine and lost 15 of his 51 games in charge of United. Manchester United (2013-14) P 51 W 27 D 9 L 15 WP 53% . Everton (2002-13) P 516 W 217 D 139 L 160 WP 42% . Preston North End (1998-2002) P 234 W 113 D58 L 63 WP 48% . He has taken time to choose his next move in the knowledge that it is a crucial one. Before his United disappointment Moyes enjoyed 11 critically-acclaimed years at Everton, leading the club to five top-six finishes. The Toffees qualified for the Champions League for the first time under Moyes' stewardship - although they lost in the qualifying stages of the competition - and he also took the Merseyside club to the FA Cup final in 2009. The former Preston boss takes over a Sociedad side, who moved out of the Primera Division relegation zone on Sunday night with a 2-1 home win over champions Atletico Madrid. Real Sociedad were looking for a new manager after Jagoba Arrasate was relieved of his duties . Moyes will stand in the dugout at the impressive Anoeta Stadium in the picturesque San Sebastian . B team coach Asier Santana was in charge for that match following last week's sacking of Jagoba Arrasate. It was only the club's second league win in 11 games this season and left them in 15th place, but level on points with second-bottom Levante. Arrasate was dismissed in the wake of a hugely disappointing start to the campaign which saw Sociedad - who finished fourth in 2013 and seventh last term - win just one of their opening 10 league fixtures as well as go out of the Europa League. Ex-West Brom and Real Betis boss Pepe Mel also had been in the running to replace Arrasate, but Moyes was reportedly Sociedad's first choice. Moyes' first game in charge is set to be the trip to newly-promoted Deportivo La Coruna after the international break. Moyes becomes the fourth British manager of the San Sebastian-based outfit, following in the footsteps of Englishman Harry Lowe and Welsh duo John Toshack and Chris Coleman.","Real Sociedad captain Xabi Prieto has welcomed the appointment of former Manchester United manager David Moyes .

"His day job is to manufacture the parts that keep Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at the top of the Formula One world championship. But Worcester City’s Sean Geddes will be sharing the headlines with them after putting the brakes on Coventry’s FA Cup hopes. Geddes played alongside Danny Welbeck, Tom Cleverley and Ravel Morrison in Manchester United’s academy but was released at the age of 16 and thought his chance would never come again. Former Manchester United academy player Sean Geddes celebrates after scoring against Coventry . The first of Geddes' two strikes at the Ricoh Arena was from the penalty spot in the first half . Geddes (centre) celebrates with team-mates Daniel Nti and Ellis Deeney after making it 1-0 from the spot . However, the midfielder’s textbook penalty and fantastic second-half finish made him the toast of Worcestershire and football romantics everywhere last night. ‘Words can’t describe it, this is the best moment of my career,’ said a beaming Geddes. ‘For the penalty, I was so nervous and I knew the keeper who came on. He said to me: “I know where you’re going” but obviously he dived to his right and I went down the middle. For the second, I couldn’t have hit it any better. It was magical, that’s the one word I can say. I loved it.’ This was Worcester City’s greatest moment since dumping Liverpool out way back in 1959. Players and management celebrated like they’d won the Cup in front of 3,220 jubilant travelling fans at the final whistle. But this was no plucky, backs-to-the-wall underdog story. The Conference North outfit made a mockery of the 64 places that separated them from their League One opponents, who famously lifted the Cup in 1987. Although aided by Coventry goalkeeper Lee Burge’s moment of madness — he kicked out at Daniel Nti and was shown a straight red card shortly before half-time — fearless Worcester were excellent value for their place in tonight’s second round draw. Worcester's first goal came after Coventry goalkeeper Lee Burge was sent off for kicking out . Referee Mr R Royce ushers Burge off the field after sending him off in the first half . Worcester goalkeeper Nathan Vaughan (centre) celebrates after saving a penalty from Reda Johnson (left) Coventry manager Steven Pressley described his team’s performance as ‘embarrassing’ and put it alongside their 1989 humbling at Sutton United as ‘one of the worst results’ in the club’s history. They won a penalty shortly after falling behind but captain Reda Johnson saw it saved by Nathan Vaughan. And although Johnson’s 81st-minute reply ensured a nail-biting finale —which included seven minutes of stoppage time that seemed like an eternity for the away fans — they never looked like scoring again. Worcester boss Carl Heeley, who played 536 times for the club, started another chapter in their history and rounded off a week he’ll never forget. He said: ‘It just caps a perfect week, my third daughter Mia was born last week and I have been up doing night feeds since then. ‘It is my proudest moment in a long association with Worcester — payback for a long injury in the late nineties and some heartache when we lost our ground. We are still in exile but this makes it all worthwhile.’ Worcester have been ground-sharing with Kidderminster for 18 months after departing St George’s Lane, their home since 1905. Johnson could have pulled one back for Coventry, but fluffed his lines from 12 yards out . Geddes looked delight to grab his second of the match, which ultimately secured the win for Worcester . Coventry's James Maddison (left) breaks away from the challenge of Ellis Deeney during the game . WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE . Conference side Dover caused an upset when they dumped League Two Morecambe out. Former Fulham trainee Stefan Payne scored the winner. Hemel Hempstead Town of the Conference South came within two minutes of drawing with Bury, 61 places above them. Nathan Cameron and Daniel Nardiello spared the Shakers’ blushes late on. Derby County showed their promotion potential with a 5-0 thrashing of Wolves and returned to the top of the Championship table. PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND .

"Talk about salt being rubbed into the wound. To all those head-in-the-hands Manchester United fans wondering where their defence has gone, these words from Inter Milan sporting director Piero Ausilio will cut deep. 'We always look for players that can improve Inter's quality regardless of their provenance. Nemanja Vidic is an example of this. He was a great signing because he arrived here intact and for free. He's got a great mentality and he will show what it means to be a winner. He has been a linchpin to a historical club like Manchester United.' There are no linchpins at Old Trafford any more - instead Louis van Gaal has a cast list of injury-prone, untried, out-of-position players for the defensive roles. Indeed, Jamie Redknapp called the United defence that finished the match against Manchester City 'the worst back four you'll ever see'. Nemanja Vidic was deemed past his sell-by date at Old Trafford but is now playing in Serie A for Inter Milan . Louis van Gaal's back-line has an unfamiliar look thanks to plenty of injuries and no back-up defenders . Here is how United finished their 1-0 derby defeat against City at the back... Antonio Valencia (winger) Michael Carrick (midfielder) Paddy McNair (a kid) Luke Shaw (a prospect but a rookie) Thirty-something Vidic is doing it in Serie A even if he was deemed past his sell-by date at United. All that dosh splashed on exciting, attacking players and only one 'senior' summer buy on a defender - £16million Argentine Marcos Rojo. And now he is crocked with a dislocated shoulder. Van Gaal is trying to build a dynasty and, so far, the foundations are being laid on shifting sands. Short-term, the Dutchman has a defensive crisis of epic proportions – January must feel light years away. Sadly for him, he cannot take a jemmy to the transfer window now. Instead the United boss must plan for the next match against Crystal Palace on the back of a measly return of 13 points from 10 matches and 13 points adrift of leaders Chelsea. The players who finished as defenders in the 1-0 derby defeat by City on Sunday were: Antonio Valencia, winger; Michael Carrick, midfielder; Paddy McNair, kid; Luke Shaw, big-money, exciting prospect but still a rookie. United's spending included a summer buy on defender Marcos Rojo who is now out with a dislocated shoulder . Unioted spent plenty on attacking players and only one 'senior' summer buy on a defender - £16million Rojo . Rojo is carried off on a stretcher during the Manchester derby between City and United on Sunday . The Premier League table . Chris Smalling, red-carded against City, is suspended for the Palace game. Phil Jones (shin splints), Jonny Evans (ankle), and Rafael (training ground mystery injury) are also out. Van Gaal must decide whether to go for experience, even if that means asking players like Carrick and Valencia to do unfamiliar jobs, or whether to look from the kindergarten ranks. Add together the Premier League games for United of Shaw, McNair, Tyler Blackett, Tom Thorpe, Marnick Vermijl, Saidy Janko and Reece James and they have notched 15 between them. Blackett has already played six League matches this season, which puts him one ahead of Shaw and three ahead of McNair. The next name on the waiting list is central defender Thorpe, who came on as a substitute against West Ham and who is regarded as a star of the future. Thorpe captains the Under 21s and was part of the successful 2011 FA Youth Cup-winning side. Players who have since emerged from that team include Ravel Morrison, Ryan Tunnicliffe and Paul Pogba. After that, it really is uncharted waters for Van Gaal. Belgian Vermijl, 22, and left back James, 20, both figured in the 4-0 Capital One Cup drubbing by MK Dons and have yet to make league debuts for United. Paddy McNair (left) and Luke Shaw (right) were part of United's makeshift defence against City on Sunday . Winger Antonio Valencia (right) started the Manchester derby at right back for United . Fellaini (second from right) was temporarily centre half after injuries and Smalling's sending off . United midfielder Carrick was forced to come on in defence against City on Sunday . CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL REPORT . James caught the eye on the pre-season tour of America, especially the performances against LA Galaxy and Roma. He has had a second chance at Old Trafford after being released by Preston. Reach even further down and there is 17-year-old Janko, who was recruited from FC Zurich last year and is regarded as one for the future. He was bought as a right back but often plays midfield. So it is headache time for Van Gaal. Valencia over Vermijl? Carrick and McNair or Thorpe or both kids at the expense of Carrick? At least Shaw is a shoo-in. Meanwhile, roll on January...

"Brendan Rodgers was pleased with the courage his Liverpool side showed as the Reds lost 1-0 to Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday. The Anfield manager elected to rest a number of key players - including Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson - and was pleased with the performance of those called upon to fill in.

The obese mother was motivated to lose 6st in 12 months after getting out of breath one day as she bent to tie her shoes.

Benteke shoves Mason in the face after kicking out at Erik Lamela, and was shown a straight red card . Referee Neil Swarbrick took his time to come to a decision, but it seemed the correct one in the end . The Villa manager said: 'I don't condone what Christian did, but my daughter could throw a harder forearm that that. 'The sending off changed the course of the game. I didn't see it at the time but, what was it, a handbag thrown? 'The lad puts his head in Christian's face and I've played the game - the natural instinct is to raise your arm to push it away and that's what he did. He's been punished for that.

"Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock refused to be drawn further on the controversy surrounding referee Mark Clattenburg's disciplinary sanction from the Football Association as he focused on Monday night's clash against Sunderland. Clattenburg has been dropped for this weekend's Barclays Premier League fixtures after breaking protocol following the match between West Brom and Palace so he could get back to Newcastle to watch Ed Sheeran perform at the Metro Radio Arena. The rules of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) state officials must travel to and from the ground together to protect their integrity and security. Neil Warnock has been given no punishment for the conversation between him and Clattenburg . Mark Clattenburg was dropped from this week's Premier League matches after breaking referees' protocol . It has also emerged that Clattenburg broke another rule by speaking to Eagles boss Warnock on the phone after the 2-2 draw at The Hawthorns. The PGMOL insists a referee should only be allowed to speak to a manager 30 minutes after the game and that conversation must take place in front of his assistants. Warnock was unhappy at a challenge by West Brom's Craig Dawson on Julian Speroni which led to the injured goalkeeper being substituted. Although the Palace boss himself is not expected to face any disciplinary action, Warnock wanted to draw a line under the incident as he focused attention on Monday night's visit of Sunderland. Victor Anichebe headed home with 51 minutes on the clock at the Hawthorns after Craig Dawson's (25) elbow . Julian Speroni was forced to come off after the incident that led to West Brom's first goal . The West Brom striker converted from close range following a corner from Chris Brunt . 'I don't really want to talk about it if I am honest, because it might get someone in trouble, and I think enough has been speculated on, but I did not do anything wrong,' Warnock said when asked for his thoughts at Saturday's pre-match press conference. 'I don't want to talk about him or any referees to be honest, I talk about them enough. People get fed up of me talking about referees, so let me talk about my team and the game, Sunderland is one to look forward to really.' Asked whether it was he who had called Clattenburg or the other way round, Warnock replied: 'Never you mind. One or two people have said it was, one or two people have said it wasn't but whatever will be, will be.' Palace's 2-2 draw against the Baggies, where they were denied victory by a stoppage-time penalty, leaves them in 16th place, but just a point above the relegation zone. Neil Warnock was angry with the decision not to award Crystal Palace a free-kick . Sunderland boss Gus Poyet shows his frustrations on the touchline as his side lose 2-0 to Arsenal . Sunderland have lost their last two matches, thumped 8-0 at Southampton in the last away match. Warnock, though, warned against complacency as the Eagles look for a first win in three matches. 'You don't kid yourself, results like Sunderland had don't happen very often,' he said. 'Every game in this league is difficult to get maximum points which is why it was so disappointing last week not to get it.' He added: 'Every team has got a chance in every game, as we saw in midweek with Newcastle's fantastic (Capital One Cup) win at Man City. 'It is the closest Premier League for many years, apart from the top two and now you are saying 'is it the top two or the top one?''","Mark Clattenburg has been dropped from weekend's Premier League action .

"Former Boston funeral director Joseph O'Donnell, 56, is accused of improperly storing a dozen bodies, stealing almost $150,000 in pre-payments and working without a license for five years . A former Boston funeral director improperly stored a dozen bodies, stole almost $150,000 in funeral pre-payments and worked without a license on more than 200 funerals and cremations, prosecutors alleged on Wednesday. The Suffolk County district attorney announced a 278-count indictment against Joseph O'Donnell, 56, who has been in custody since he pleaded not guilty in April to stealing $12,000 in funeral prepayments from an elderly couple. The new charges include improper disposal of human remains, embezzlement, larceny, forgery, falsifying official documents and acting as a funeral director without a license. Prosecutors said O'Donnell's license expired in 2009 but he continued doing business until the foreclosure of his funeral home in 2013. Investigators found the 12 decomposed bodies, along with 32 sets of cremated remains, in July in a self-storage facility O'Donnell rented in Weymouth. Prosecutors said in August that 11 of the bodies were identified and their investigation was continuing. Prosecutors said on Wednesday that the 11 bodies were those of people who died when O'Donnell was operating illegally, and the families of eight of them had been given the cremated remains of other people. Prosecutors said six sets of those ashes were recovered but two sets already were scattered. Prosecutors said they are still trying to identify the remains of the 12th body, an adult woman. At another storage facility O'Donnell rented in Somerville, investigators found 45 sets of cremated remains, which they said were believed to be unclaimed remains from his funeral home. O'Donnell is due in court Thursday for an administrative hearing on his original case. His arraignment on the new charges hasn't been scheduled.

"Tony Romo will travel to London and will prepare as if he will play against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

And Jones was less than complimentary about his side’s meagre offense, telling NFL Network: ‘Very limited today. I’m surprised it was that limited.’ Romo did not practice all week but the decision not to play him was taken just 90 minutes before the game. ‘He progressed each and every day, never to the point where he could practice. So obviously without getting any work up to this point, it was a fairly easy decision once we got to gameday,’ said head coach Jason Garrett.

"London has taken another step towards hosting a new NFL franchise after George Osborne opened talks with the American Football authorities. The Chancellor is keen to push forward with the idea of bringing the NFL to England on a permanent basis and has held discussions over using Wembley as a permanent base.

"‘Closet NFL fan’ Joey Barton thinks the demand for International Series tickets and the passion displayed by UK American football fans are enough evidence to suggest that England is ready for a franchise. Ahead of the latest NFL regular-season game at Wembley between Atlanta and Detroit on Sunday, the QPR midfielder joined Falcons running back Steven Jackson and Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh for an event at NikeTown in Oxford Circus on Tuesday. American football fans attended for a question and answer session hosted by Vernon Kay in which the players discussed the different training and preparation methods used by both sports. Steven Jackson (left) Ndamukong Suh (centre) and Joey Barton (right) attended an NFL event at NikeTown . Barton, Jackson and Suh discussed the difference in training and preparation methods between their respective sports . Barton now admits to being ‘hooked’ on NFL and thinks the English fans have demonstrated that they’re ready for a team of their own. He told Sportsmail: ‘I think there’s a demand for it. There is a stadium here that I think they would sell out if they were a good enough team. ‘The difficulty would be flying about, but it’s probably just as easy to fly from New York to London as it is to fly from New York to Los Angeles. Atlanta Falcons running back Jackson (left) and Detroit Lions defensive tackle Suh (right) Jackson, Barton and Suh answered questions from fans in attendance and signed autographs in Oxford Circus . Barton admitted to being a 'closet NFL fan' ‘Seeing the Wembley games and how much more frequent they have become, you certainly see the passion when the tickets sell out as quickly as they do. ‘I went to the first game this season between the Dolphins and the Raiders and seeing how passionate the fans were and all the different jerseys on show, I think there’s a really emerging market for it here.’ Atlanta’s clash with Detroit at Wembley on Sunday will be the 10th regular-season game in England since the International Series began in 2007 and is once again a sell-out. Barton’s interest in American football came from reading up on the sport before slowly gaining an understanding of the game and picking up the rules. He said: ‘I have been a closet NFL fan for a number of years. I’m a New York Giants fan and I’m a big fan of Eli Manning. I like the way he plays the game and he’s got a carefree attitude. ‘I’m also a fan of (coach) Tom Coughlin. I’ve read a lot of books by a lot of different NFL coaches, along with Bill Walsh’s book I think Coughlin’s was very informative. ‘I got into NFL that way – watching it without really understanding the rules and then the more I watched it the more I understood the rules. ‘My interest in it grew from there once I knew the rules and what was going on. You delve into it further and further and before you know it you’re hooked.’ Ndamukong Suh, Steven Jackson and Joey Barton were at NikeTown London as part of the 'Suit up for Sunday' campaign and ahead of the second 2014 NFL International Series game.

"This is the dramatic moment police used a chainsaw to cut open a front door in a raid on a suspected drugs den. Dressed in helmets and balaclavas, 20 officers from West Mercia Police burst into the flat in Warndon, Worcestershire yesterday afternoon. Two men and a woman, all in their thirties, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs. Scroll down for video . Officers wearing helmets and balaclavas use a chainsaw to cut their way into the suspected drugs den . After cutting a human-sized hole officers burst through the door and fend off two Staffordshire Bull Terriers . Lead by a team of eight members of the Task Force, officers had to use a 3ft-long petrol-powered chainsaw to slice open a hole in the door. As it came crashing down they were forced to fend off two Staffordshire Bull Terriers using a dog attack deterrent spray called ‘bite back’ to subdue them. They arrested the three suspects and seized an amount of drugs in the raid, which happened on Randwick Drive at about 3.30pm yesterday. PC Wayne Hurley, from the Warndon Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: ‘It was a good result. It is all intelligence-based policing. It is a priority for this area that we tackle drugs.

"Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta claims the Premier League champions are now bigger and better than neighbours United. City’s 1-0 win over United on Sunday was their fourth in a row against their local rivals and as good as ended any title hopes Louis van Gaal’s team may have had. And after hearing Van Gaal claim before the game that United were still the bigger club, the City right-back was happy to hit back. Pablo Zabaleta believes his side have overtaken Manchester United as the club's 'main team' The Argentine, pictured with Robin van Persie, was part of the City side which beat United at the weekend . Zabaleta said: ‘All I can say is that City’s players and the owners are making a big effort to be a top team not just in Manchester but also in the Premier League and also in Europe. ‘Probably it’s a different history now than years ago where probably United was the main team in the city. Now it’s a bit different.’ City are still searching for their best form ahead of a crucial Champions League game at home to CSKA Moscow and Zabaleta admitted that City must improve if they are to salvage their Champions League hopes, as well as to hang on to Chelsea’s coattails at the top of the league. ‘It’s another huge game on Wednesday,’ Zabaleta said. ‘We were very unlucky the last time we played them. We drew and we were winning 2-0 but obviously it’s a crucial point for us. ‘We need a win because if not it’s going to be very hard to qualify for the next round. A win could get us started. ‘We are a much better team than we’ve shown — and we can do even better.’ Zabaleta has warned his team-mates they must improve their form in the Champions League .

Meanwhile Zabaleta’s team-mate has come in for criticism from Bayern Munich legend Oliver Kahn, who says he needs to be more consistent to be considered alongside Bayern’s Manuel Neuer as the world’s best. ‘Neuer changed the game of goalkeeping,’ Kahn said. ‘Neuer makes a lot less mistakes than Hart. 'If you look at him there are some games where he plays not very well, Manuel is more on a constant level than Hart. Hart needs to be more consistent.’ City face Bayern in Munich later this month with their qualification hopes on the line and Kahn said: ‘It’s a big chance for Bayern to put Manchester City out and they will want to do it.’","Pablo Zabaleta believes his side are now bigger than Man United .

"Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul pushed back on Friday on New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's claim earlier this week that the next President of the United States 'needs to be' a governor. 'Jimmy Carter wasn't that great of a president,' Paul, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, told MailOnline in an interview after his appearance this afternoon at a rally for Georgia Senate candidate David Perdue. 'I just...I'm not sure that's the best thing, such a simplistic sort of criteria...for what we do,' the first-term senator said. Sen. Rand Paul speaks to an audience of supporters of Georgia Senate candidate David Perdue during a campaign stop at the McDonough Square this afternoon in McDonough, Georgia. Paul said Georgians should elect Perdue, a former CEO of Dollar General, because of his business background . In a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., Christie said he is 'convinced that the next president of the United States is going to be a governor—and needs to be.' The presumed 2016 presidential candidate added: 'We have had an experiment of a legislator who has never run anything getting on-the-job training in the White House. It has not been pretty. And so we need to have a big and broad bench of good, experienced Republican governors to select from in 2016.' On Friday Paul told MailOnline that there have been good governors that went on to be good presidents. Furthermore, he said, there have been bad governors that have been good senators. 'I think we'll figure it out over time,' Paul said, 'but it's probably simplistic to think that one particular occupation makes one person better than the other.' Carter, a Democrat, was the governor of Georgia for four years before he was elected to the presidency. He served just one term as as Commander in Chief before he was booted by voters. The Peach State politician lost the 1980 presidential election to another governor: Ronald Reagan, who served served as chief executive of California for two full terms before seeking election to higher office. Carter's presidency is often synonymous with inflation, recession and high unemployment. The U.S. also experienced an energy crisis during his tenure as oil output in the Middle East decreased during the Iranian Revolution in 1979. That same year wrought the Iran hostage crisis - a 444-day stand off between radical Muslim, Iranian students and the U.S. during the country's revolution. The group held 52 Americans captive in Tehran until January 20, 1981, the day that Carter left office. Relations between Iran and the U.S. have never been the same, and the incident led to the economic sanctions on the country. With tensions running high over the ongoing hostage crisis, Republicans had a banner election year in 1980. Carter won just six states to Reagan's 44. Reagan went on to easily win reelection in 1984. He was succeeded by his vice president, George H.W. Bush - a former Member of Congress who never served as governor of his home state, Texas. Bush was also defeated after only one term by Bill Clinton, then-governor of Arkansas. Megachurch pastor Benny Tate, left, shakes hands with Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson, center, as Paul,  center left, and Perdue, right, look on before today's get out the vote rally . Clinton was succeeded in office after two terms by George W. Bush, the then-governor of Texas. Bush was replaced after he reached his two term limit by current President Barack Obama, a former community organizer with a background in constitutional law who served in the Illinois state senate before representing his home state in U.S. Senate and launching a bid for the presidency. Paul may have a nuanced view of what sort of politicians tend to be the best national leaders, but he made it clear at Friday's rally for Perdue that he thinks Americans who have experience working in the private sector make the best  lawmakers. 'When I first ran for office people said, ""You're just doctor from a small town. What business do you have running for office?"" And I said, ""You know what? Precisely my attributes and assets are that I have never held any office before,"" ' Paul told the crowd of people who had gathered to see him speak in the town square of McDonough, Georgia this afternoon. The audience ate up Paul's remarks, clapping loudly, and making supportive comments throughout. 'I haven't been beaten down by the system, and I have a good job and skills, that I can go back to at any point in time I want, so I'm unafraid to do what's right, and I think David Perdue will be the same,' Paul continued. 'And besides, we've already tried a community organizer, and I'd rather have someone that knows how to create jobs rather than just how to spend the money,' he said, taking a jab at Obama. Paul told the audience that the Senate has 'plenty of lawyers' but only a few businessmen. 'I think it would be great to have someone with some common sense, with some business sense to create jobs,' he said. Perdue is a former Reebok CEO. He later served as CEO of Dollar General, where he says he created 20,000 jobs, before starting his own firm in 2011. The wealthy businessman has taken flak from his main opponent in the race, Democrat Michelle Nunn, a non-profit head, for allegedly outsourcing of jobs while he served as the CEO of the a now-defunct textile manufacturing company Pillowtex Corp. In a 2005 deposition obtained by Politico, Perdue said, 'I spent most of my career' outsourcing. Confronted about the remarks by a reporter a few weeks ago, the Georgia Republican doubled down. 'I'm proud of it. This is a part of American business, part of any business,' he said. 'Outsourcing is the procurement of products and services to help your business run,' he added. Nunn has used Perdue's position on outsourcing to undercut his business credentials. 'We need to ask what David's business career really equips him to do,' Nunn said Wednesday at campaign event, according to the Associated Press. 'Is it really to serve the people of Georgia?' she asked. Perdue is in a close race to represent Georgia in the Senate with non-profit head Michelle Nunn. A CNN poll released today shows Nunn up by three points over Perdue . On Friday Paul appeared to subtly refer to the outsourcing controversy in his speech touting Perdue. There's two trillion dollars overseas in business, he said. 'Why isn't it coming home? Because we've got the worst tax code in the world right now,' he posited. 'Until we take over the majority [in the Senate], we will never get a chance to fix the tax code,' he said. 'We have the highest corporate tax in the whole world right now. We are twice what Canada's tax rate is. I never thought I'd be on a stage saying that I'm envious of Canada's tax code,' he said to laughter from the audience. 'We have a regulatory burden of two trillion dollars a year, a tax burden of three trillion dollars a year, and we're not gonna improve it until we figure out one simple thing: You want Georgia to do better? You want Georgia to create jobs? You gotta leave more money in Georgia and send less money to Washington,' he said. Paul told MailOnline in an interview after the event that he thinks the Senate 'could use a fresh perspective' from someone with business experience like Perdue. 'You know, currently we have a president who never ran a business, never really ever employed anybody, or really worked in the private sector. So I think he really, the current president, doesn't have as much of an understanding of how jobs are created,' he said. 'And I think someone from the business community probably has a better understanding of that.' Perdue said in his stump speech Friday that he's running for the Senate because he 'got so fed up with what's coming out of Washington...and I want to do something about it.' 'Like Sen. Paul I'd never even thought about doing this. Never even thought about politics,' he said. It was not until he saw the way the president's policies were affecting his family, that he decided to seek elected office. 'Michelle Nunn wants to be Barack Obama's senator. I want to be your senator,' he told the audience. Georgia has become a pivotal state in the fight for the Senate this election cycle. On Thursday President Obama told an Atlanta radio station that a Nunn win 'means that Democrats keep control of the Senate.' A CNN/ORC International poll released today shows Nunn leading Perdue 47-44 with a three percent margin of error. If neither Nunn nor Perdue are able to neutralize Libertarian candidate Amanda Swafford, who is polling at five percent, before Election Day to reach the state's mandatory 50 percent threshold, the race will go to a run off in January - after the new legislative session in Washington has already commenced.","Christie said this week he's 'convinced that the next president of the United States is going to be a governor—and needs to be'

"Louis Saha has urged Manchester United to address their defensive problems in the January transfer window or risk missing out on the Champions League again. United dropped to 10th place in the Barclays Premier League after Sunday's 1-0 derby defeat to Manchester City and Saha fears his former club could now finish outside the top four for the second successive season. David Moyes was sacked last April just 10 months after succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson as United went from champions to seventh - their lowest league position for 25 years - and replaced by the experienced Dutchman Louis van Gaal. Louis Saha celebrates scoring the winner against Sunderland at Old Trafford in September 2007 . Anderson and Saha (centre) congratulate Cristiano Ronaldo (right) after his goal against Blackburn in 2007 . 'I hope they finish in top four but I can't be sure,' said Saha, who scored 42 goals in 124 appearances for United between 2004 and 2008. 'A club of this size should be looking for the fourth spot to be in the Champions League but it is not the case right now. 'You could say the issues are at the back but it's about balance, finding the right midfielder to keep the ball and a defender to be strong at a certain point of the game. Former Fulham, United and Everton striker Saha was speaking at the DohaGOALS Conference in Qatar . 'It's difficult to predict what will happen but when you have a very balanced side you have balanced results. 'I'm not more experienced than Louis van Gaal to know what was a (defensive) regret for him but we will see at the end of the season, and what he does in this window this winter will be very important for Manchester United.' Saha, speaking at the DohaGOALS Conference in Qatar, believes Van Gaal will get the time to turn around United that was not afforded to Moyes, who took the Frenchman from United to Everton in 2008. But Saha said Van Gaal must listen to the concerns of the fans and add defensive strength in January to go with the impressive attacking armoury he now has at his disposal following a summer of heavy investment which saw Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao added to the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata. 'You always have to listen to what people say and maybe the defence is a bit weak or not experienced enough,' Saha said. Everton manager David Moyes speaks to Saha after his side's 2-1 FA Cup win over Middlesbrough in 2009 . 'He (Van Gaal) has to look at it and address that point for sure, but he is an experienced manager so I've no doubt he will do so. 'I have seen a slight change and you can see there is a bit more confidence and a bit more shape, but the result is not what you would expect from a side like this. 'Time will definitely be on his side more than David Moyes because of the experience he has and the trophies in all his clubs. 'You expect the Premier League to be a difficult challenge for any team and Manchester United has been struggling in the last two years, but in football you have to make the transition as soon as possible.' But Saha rejected criticism that United's failure to improve under Van Gaal was down to the Dutchman being surprised by the intensity of the Premier League. 'He's experienced, he has plenty of gigabytes of information and people there with him who know about football,' Saha said. 'It would be unthinkable for Manchester United not to be in the Champions League again but the Premier League is a different league to what it was 10 years ago. 'There are many teams that have got huge players and the quality is greater - that's why I stopped, I think! 'The level and intensity what you can show every week is amazing, there are no easy games.'","Louis Saha scored 42 goals in 124 appearances for Manchester United between 2004 and 2008 .

"Scotland has been kind to Sir Paul McCartney. When, in 1970, he found himself aimless and bereft following the break-up of the Beatles, it was to a small farm in the country that he retreated. High Park lies on the Kintyre Peninsula, that snake of land on the country’s south-west coast stretching 30 miles from Tarbert in the north to the Mull (headland) of Kintyre in the south. The life McCartney and his new wife Linda adopted there — simple, basic, shorn of luxury — proved his salvation. Sir Paul McCartney cradles a lamb and cuddles his first wife Linda McCartney at High Park Farm, Kintyre . Gradually, the drug-taking and heavy drinking threatening his well-being subsided and he again began to write music. Happiness, once sought in the nightclubs of London and New York, was to be found in patching up a leaky roof or shearing a sheep. In 1977, McCartney repaid his debt to his adopted home with an anthem. Mull Of Kintyre was the first single to sell more than two million copies in Britain and established for good the musician’s association with this remote strip of land. The ties between the surviving Beatles and Britain are particularly moot given that this month the news broke that his former bandmate Ringo Starr is selling his rural 200‑acre Surrey estate and moving to the United States. Ringo and his wife Barbara Bach, a former Bond Girl, are set to make Los Angeles their main home. McCartney repaid his debt to his adopted home in 1977 by writing the song, Mull Of Kintyre, which was the first single to sell more than two million copies . Yet what many people do not realise is that Sir Paul, too, has quietly all but severed his connection with his own peaceful corner of the nation. Since his arrival on the Mull of Kintyre in 1966, he has expanded his estate into one of considerable size. And yet I have learned that he has not been seen by some locals who live there for half a decade. Today, he is married to the American Nancy Shevell, and prefers to divide his time between London and New York. ‘Over the years, Sir Paul has bought what used to be about seven different holdings,’ says David Young, a farmer and neighbour on the Mull of Kintyre. ‘The aim seems to have been to ensure privacy by purchasing neighbouring stretches of land. I would say the estate covers approximately 1,000 acres now.’ The couple with their three children during an extended stay at the family farm in Kintyre, Scotland . Locals in the nearby fishing port of Campbeltown have always harboured warm feelings towards the family . For many years, the McCartney family were allowed to enjoy their breaks at High Park in peace — there is no great mansion, only a modest farmhouse — and were rarely stopped in the street. Locals in the nearby fishing port of Campbeltown have always harboured warm feelings towards the McCartneys, and Sir Paul is still respected widely in the area. But there is one sour note: the treatment new management meted out to two long-standing employees at High Park, one of whom found himself thrown out of his tied cottage and banished to a caravan after 20 years of faithful service. Farmworker Jimmy Paterson and his partner Marion Pope now inhabit a small corner of the former Royal Air Force station at Machrihanish, a few miles from High Park. The simple life that Paul and Linda adopted at the farm proved to be his salvation, far away from the nightclubs in London and New York . Some eight months after being forced to quit their home on the McCartney estate, High Ranachan Farm, they are still looking for permanent accommodation. Estate manager Bobby Cairns, who worked for Sir Paul for some 30 years, was also dismissed in a shake-up of the estate which placed it on a more commercial footing under the supervision of a new manager. ‘I don’t know why they were removed,’ says Mr Young, whose family has farmed in the area for generations. ‘They were perfectly capable of doing what they were asked to do. They were told to manage the farm in the way they did. It was out of the blue. Really unexpected.’ But what do the two men say about their treatment? ‘You won’t hear anything from them,’ he says, making a zipping motion across his mouth. After Linda's death in 1998, Paul's visits to the Mull of Kintyre became much less frequent . Down at the vast, deserted airfield, a venue for some of the most secret operations of the Cold War, Miss Pope is saying nothing. ‘I can’t speak out of respect for Jimmy’s wishes,’ she says about her partner who was sacked. Do they feel betrayed by Sir Paul? She smiles but refuses to elaborate. The reason, according to local people, is a gagging clause in the severance agreement signed by both men. Is that true? ‘All I will say is that money is power,’ Miss Pope adds. Sir Paul certainly has plenty of that. Never extravagant in public, he has built a financial empire running into hundreds of millions of pounds. It is believed that the musician initially bought the farm to minimise his exposure to tax . Such fortunes are rarely subject to detailed public analysis, but a light was shone on the singer’s wealth in 2008 when he faced his second wife, Heather Mills, across the floor of the High Court in London to hammer out a divorce settlement. Miss Mills demanded £125 million from her former husband, claiming his fortune amounted to some £800 million. The judge calculated McCartney’s fortune at half that and awarded Mills £24 million. During the hearing, the extent of Sir Paul’s property empire became known, including the obligatory repertoire of superstar homes in London, Manhattan, the Hamptons and Beverly Hills, as well as his farm in Sussex and house in Arizona. That High Park Farm survives in Sir Paul’s portfolio is due mainly to sentiment. It is thought to have been bought initially to minimise the young McCartney’s exposure to tax. The year was 1966, Eleanor Rigby was playing on the nation’s radios and the lad from Liverpool was enjoying his first season as a millionaire. McCartney’s then girlfriend, the actress Jane Asher, helped him select High Park from a pile of properties for sale, and visited it with him. But it was Linda, Lady McCartney, who took the place to her heart, renovating the three-bedroom farmhouse while Paul installed a recording studio. The song The Long And Winding Road was inspired by the area, as well as, of course, Mull Of Kintyre, accompaniment for the latter being provided by Campbeltown’s pipe and drum band. ‘It was a love song really,’ explained Sir Paul, ‘about how I enjoyed being there and imagining I was travelling away and wanting to get back.’ Sir Paul and his advisers are said to be no longer willing to accept losses on his farms and are renting out fields to neighbours, while encouraging forestry . Converts to vegetarianism (this week Sir Paul appeared in a video in which he gave an impromptu rap, encouraging fans to give up meat one day a week), the McCartneys allowed the farm to grow wild. Deer multiplied, fields became overgrown and the couple’s four children, Heather, Mary, Stella and James, found themselves at home in an enormous playground, isolated from prying eyes. Drive along the tracks linking Sir Paul’s holdings and you enter a dreamscape of rolling hills topped by conifers, a quiet, otherworldly place of loch and burn. ‘Local people didn’t bother Sir Paul — they let him be,’ says Mr Young. ‘The great attraction was that he could fly into the small airport in his private jet and within 20 minutes be in a different world.’ Linda’s death in 1998 was a turning point. Gradually, visits to High Park tailed off. Perhaps there was too much pain in its associations, but the singer has refused to part with a property replete with family memories. There are still visits to High Park by relatives and friends of Sir Paul, but visits by the singer-songwriter are now virtually unknown. It is thought that he has not dropped in on his Scottish home for around five years, one of the last great influxes of McCartneys being in 2003 for the wedding of Stella, a clothes designer, on the nearby Isle of Bute. ‘The gates to the estate are padlocked now,’ says Mr Young. ‘I wouldn’t say it’s hostile but a relationship that was once close is now strained. I have nothing against the new manager; it’s the policy that’s changed.’ Once, the principled McCartneys would not allow fodder from their farm to be sold to feed animals destined for slaughter. High Park was a hippie paradise in which profit counted for little. But that appears to have changed, too. Sir Paul and his advisers are said to be no longer willing to accept losses on his farms and are renting out fields to neighbours, while encouraging forestry. ‘Basically, the place became a wildlife haven,’ says Mr Young. ‘It was quite a sight to see the hundreds of deer roaming over the land — beautiful. It’s a shame. It was very beautiful the way it was. I am very sad at the changes made. ‘But despite those changes, I personally have very great respect for Sir Paul. He has done an enormous amount for the area and injected an enormous amount of money into the local economy. ‘There were never any airs and graces. He and his family are truly pleasant people.’ Others are less effusive. One woman, who refuses to give her name, says: ‘We don’t care about these celebrities if they are not living here or contributing to life here.’ Down in Campbeltown is a memorial garden dedicated to Linda McCartney. Her image sits there, in bronze, cradling a lamb. Sir Paul did not attend its unveiling. In Mull Of Kintyre, McCartney sings of wanting ‘always to be here’. But 37 years after the song seduced the nation, it seems his ardour has cooled.","Sir Paul McCartney bought High Park Farm, Kintyre, in 1966 .

"Louis van Gaal branded Chris Smalling ‘stupid’ for his sending-off in the Manchester derby defeat that consigned United to their worst start to a season in 28 years. Sergio Aguero scored City’s 63rd-minute strike in the 1-0 win but the turning point came six minutes before half-time when Smalling lunged at James Milner to earn a second yellow card from referee Michael Oliver, having been cautioned earlier for needlessly blocking a clearance by goalkeeper Joe Hart. ‘In a derby you have to be careful — the second yellow card is a stupid yellow card,’ said Van Gaal. ‘The first I didn’t see but as a player with a yellow card you have to deal with that. You have to control your aggression. I said that to the players. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal slam Chris Smalling for being stupid .

Nevertheless it is, in my opinion, not so smart.’ It is the second Sunday on the run that Van Gaal has accused one of his players of stupidity. He said the same about Robin van Persie last week after he was booked for removing his shirt while celebrating his late equaliser against Chelsea. Van Gaal did, however, defend United midfielder Marouane Fellaini from accusations that he he spat at Aguero. Video footage online showed the Belgian standing over Aguero as the Argentine lay on the ground. Pablo Zabaleta, who was later booked, brings down Robin van Persie but was not carded for this challenge .

Paddy McNair (centre) had to come on for Manchester United but Van Gaal insisted it wasn't a problem . United’s manager said: ‘I have heard it is a question on social media but already he has said he is shouting and sometimes when you shout there is a little bit of saliva. I don’t think he is a spitting figure.’ City’s victory moved them six points behind leaders Chelsea, while United now have only 13 points from 10 games — their lowest total at this stage since Ron Atkinson was sacked this same week in 1986. City’s fourth successive derby triumph means United are yet to win away under Van Gaal and are only five points above the drop zone. United’s defensive problems increased when Marcos Rojo was carried off with a dislocated shoulder, leaving Van Gaal short of options for Saturday’s home match against Crystal Palace. Aguero celebrates his strike, which turned out to be the winner, but not before City had survived a few scares .

Smalling, the third United player to be sent off this season, will be suspended while Phil Jones and Jonny Evans are still injured. United did rally late and forced Hart into two fine saves. But City had three penalty claims refused by referee Oliver during a heated match which also saw Hart seemingly touch heads with the official while appealing against a decision. City boss Manuel Pellegrini would not criticise Oliver about the penalty decisions but said Rojo should have been sent off for bringing down Yaya Toure. ‘We played very well,’ said the Chilean. ‘We scored and in that moment we dropped back a bit more.

"Ched Evans continues to divide Sheffield United fans over whether the club should re-sign the striker, who was convicted of raping a 19-year-old in 2011, following his release from jail this week. Fans chanted loudly in support of the 25-year-old, who continues to profess his innocence, as Sheffield United beat Bradford City 2-0 at Valley Parade in their first game since Evans was released from Wymott Prison, near Preston. But TV presenter and women’s rights campaigner Charlie Webster urged the club not to re-sign Evans, stating that she would quit her role as a Sheffield United patron if he was given his job back. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sheffield United fans on re-signing Ched Evans . Charlie Webster says she will quit her role as Sheffield United patron if they re-sign Ched Evans . Sheffield United fans show their support for Ched Evans during Saturday's match at Bradford City . ‘This is my club that I was brought up in, watching games at the stadium since I was four years old,’ said Webster. ‘I also worked at the club as a patron for the foundation, which is about integrity and respect. ‘My club is about community. It has much more power than just football. ‘It influences the next generation and I don’t believe it is sending out the right message to employ a convicted rapist. ‘I won’t stand here and represent that. Not in my name, not in my community and not in my club.’ Sheffield United are deliberating bringing back the Welsh striker following his release . Webster, who was sexually assaulted as a teenager, is a lifelong Blades fan but stated that she would be deeply saddened if they recruited the Wales striker again. ‘He is a celebrity,’ she said, ‘They’re cheering him on. When I was four-years-old I cheered on a set of footballers, I was influenced by them and the people around them. ‘What is the influence going to be for the next generation, cheering on a convicted rapist — that he didn’t do anything wrong? ‘As much as I love my football club — which I 100 per cent do and support for United runs strongly in my family — it doesn’t run stronger than my morals.’ Evans, 25, scored 48 goals in 113 games for the Blades and was named in the Professional Footballers’ Association League One team of the year for the 2011-12 campaign, which was announced days after he was jailed for rape. His family, and the family of his girlfriend, Natasha Massey, who has stood by him throughout his trial and as he served half of a five-year sentence, have set up a website in support of the player. It emerged that attempts to have his rape conviction quashed are to be fast-tracked through the watchdog that examines possible miscarriages of justice. The Criminal Cases Review Commission is to make his case a priority. It would normally take around 18 months to examine a claim of miscarriage of justice. Instead, the commission has taken the unusual decision to examine Evans’ case within weeks. ‘We now expect our substantive investigation to begin within the next few weeks,’ said a spokesman. At Valley Parade, Sheffield United beat Bradford City courtesy of a 66th-minute wonder strike by Robert Harris from outside the box and an 83rd-minute clincher from Marc McNulty. The Welsh footballer, who last played for Sheffield United, was pictured leaving Wymott Prison . Bradford had been reduced to 10 men five minutes into the second half when Stephen Darby was dismissed for a second yellow card offence. In the TL Dallas Stand, which hosted the visiting fans, chants of ‘Super Chedwyn Evans,’ could be heard on several occasions during the match. One fan unfurled a banner of the Welsh Dragon with ‘that boy, Ched Evans’ emblazoned upon it. Webster was verbally abused on Twitter after speaking out against re-signing the player. Some of his supporters claimed she was being hypocritical, highlighting a tweet she sent last month about seeing Mike Tyson in a hotel lobby and wanting to ask for his autograph. Family and friends arrived at Evans' mother's house in North Wales following his release on Friday . Tyson was convicted of rape in 1992 and served half of a six-year sentence. Webster said she did not register his past at the time. ‘In hindsight, I’m not proud of that tweet but the response has been another unfortunate example of berating someone for speaking out against rape.’ Webster said that Evans should not be allowed to play for United, especially while he continues ‘not to accept any responsibility for what happened that night’. She added: ‘I’ve been abused for speaking out and the victim has had a hate campaign against her so I’m very sad and disappointed. ‘If that was their family, their daughter, their mother that had been raped, these people would not have that same opinion.’","Ched Evans was released from prison in the early hours on Friday .

She retweeted a message the presenter posted last month saying she wanted to get a photograph of former heavyweight boxing champion and convicted rapist Mike Tyson. Miss Webster told BBC Radio 5 Live she felt it would be wrong to continue as a patron of the community foundation if Ched Evans ever steps out in Sheffield United colours again. She said: 'He says he is innocent, he has shown no remorse.' Miss Webster, who is a member of the Justice Ministry's Victims' Panel which was set up so that those who have been affected by crime can tell ministers directly how the criminal justice system could better serve people in their position, said: 'I feel like it is my duty and responsibility to stand up to this. 'Very few people would be able to walk back into the same job as they did before being a convicted rapist.' Family and friends arrived at Evans' mother's house in North Wales following his release on Friday . In response Evans' sister pointed to a tweet which Miss Webster posted on September 10. It reads: 'Just bumped into Mike Tyson in the hotel lobby as I was randomly talking about him! I chickened out on asking for a photo...damn.' Ms Evans tweeted: 'This is the same Charlie Webster that's just threatened to leave United. Hypocrite.' Tyson was convicted of rape in 1992 after an incident the previous year and subsequently served three years of a six-year sentence. Evans was jailed in April 2012 for raping the woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. His release will pile more pressure on his former club, Sheffield United, to say whether he will be allowed to play for them again.

"Tottenham are far too good to go down. Right? Of course they are. While this Spurs squad isn't equipped to challenge for a top-four place, there's no way in hell they'll be involved in a relegation battle at the end of the season. But that's what we said about Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest in 1993, West Ham in 2003, Leeds United 12 months later. They were all too good to go down. Tottenham have lost five of their opening 11 Premier League games under Mauricio Pochettino this season . Spanish striker Roberto Saldado has struggled for form at White Hart Lane . Brazilian Paulinho arrived as a high-rated midfielder but has not started for Pochettino's side this season . Erik Lamela (left) has had some spectacular moments for Spurs this term but his form is still inconsistent . Christian Eriksen has shown some value for money for Spurs but only in patches . Mauricio Pochettino's start at White Hart Lane has been chequered to say the least. His side's form in the Europa League and Capital One Cup has been good. But it's their Premier League form that'll be concerning the Argentine. Five defeats from their opening 11 games has left them with an uphill struggle to even be in contention for a Champions League position. On 14 points, they are closer to rock-bottom Burnley than league leaders Chelsea. Losing Gareth Bale at the start of last season was always going to be a huge blow for Pochettino . With some of the talent at Pochettino's disposal, that statistic is unforgivable. Losing Gareth Bale at the start of last season was always going to be a huge loss. Take a player of Bale's quality out of any side, you'll notice the difference. Just ask Brendan Rodgers about what impact Luis Suarez's departure at Liverpool has had on his side this season. Bale was replaced by a raft of new signings in 2013; players which we were led to believe would make Spurs a better all-round outfit - even without their superstar Welshman. Harry Redknapp guided Spurs to fourth place in the final Premier League standings back in 2012 . It turns out that Spurs signed a raft of duds. Andre Villas-Boas that found out to his detriment last season, Pochettino is finding out now. Roberto Soldado arrived from Valencia with a hugely impressive goal record. The less said about him said the better. Paulinho came with the reputation of being one of the best central midfielders in South American football when he arrived from Corinthians. He hasn't started a single league game this season. Erik Lamela did, of course, score that sublime Rabona goal against Brighton earlier this season, but he's hardly proved a worthwhile £30million deal. Christian Eriksen has shown some value for money, but only in patches. What has happened to all these players? Has all that talent just vanished into the north London atmosphere? Spurs are in the midst of an alarming slide down to mid-table obscurity. If things continue, that scenario could get even worse. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy will be expecting Pochettino to turn Spurs's fortunes around quickly . Will they get relegated? No chance. But the fact we are even discussing the prospect is a sad indictment of how far their fortunes have fallen in the past two-and-a-half years. A team that finished fourth under Harry Redknapp in 2012 has gone backwards. It begs the question of why Redknapp was ever relieved of his duties later that summer. That's an altogether different topic, though. The only topic that concerns Spurs fans at the moment is how they can wrestle themselves out of their current malaise. Giving Pochettino funds to sign the two strikers he wants in January will be a start. To judge Pochettino at this early stage of his tenure would be unfair. This is not his Spurs team. But as history tells, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy isn't one for excuses.","Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham side have lost five of their opening 11 Premier League matches .

They were outstanding in their discipline and the way they carried the threat all night. ‘I was impressed with our younger players especially, and that bodes well going forward. ‘We just needed some belief and we’ve got that now after three victories.’ And, of the draw away to Spurs, he said: ‘I suspected it would be us after the weekend, it was ironic.

"Former Real Madrid manager Bernd Schuster has heaped praise on his compatriot Toni Kroos after the German's eye-catching performance against Rayo Vallecano. The 24-year-old scored his first La Liga goal for Los Blancos as they comfortably defeated Rayo 5-1 at the Bernabeu on Saturday evening. And Schuster, who played for Los Blancos between 1998 and 1990, believes Kroos is playing perfectly at the moment, even comparing the former Bayern Munich star to himself. Former Real Madrid boss Bernd Schuster compares Toni Kroos to himself in Monday edition of Marca . As a player (1988-90) Appearances: 61 . Goals: 13 . As a manager (2007-08) Honours: La Liga (2008), Copa del Rey (2008) Speaking to Spanish newspaper Marca, Schuster said: 'He was one of the best. He did a bit of everything: defend, attack, give an assist, score one for himself. 'For Bale's goal, it was quintessential Kroos - he recovers the ball, moves up the pitch and gives that deadly pass. He finished off the day with his own goal - shooting is something he's marvellous at. 'I can expect anything from Kroos because he's an intelligent player. And intelligence is something very important in football. 'As a player, he has it all: a vision of the game, short passes, long passes... but I still think that his best position, at least where I like him the most because his full potential can be exploited, is a little further up the pitch. 'We are similar in that we are both German, blonde and have the same vision of the game.'

"For 12 months Erik Lamela could not hit a barn door with a banjo, but on Thursday the Argentine came up with a wonder goal to show why Tottenham shelled out £30million for his services.

The Argentine manager has been credited with helping his fellow countryman rediscover his form following disappointing first season. Lamela arrived at White Hart Lane from Roma in August 2013, having scored 15 goals in Serie A the previous season. His arrival paved the way for Gareth Bale’s £86m departure to Real Madrid and inevitable comparisons were drawn between the pair. But while Bale excelled at the Bernabeu, winning the Champions League and the Copa del Rey in his first season, Lamela toiled in England. But Lamela has begun to show glimpses of his talent this season and he scored again in the 66th minute with a crisp first-time volley.

The German title holders celebrated their win with a private audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Wednesday morning but Guardiola insisted his side could still improve and that mistakes had been made in the Stadio Olimpico demolition. And all this despite Pope Francis apparently telling a Bayern delegation they had played 'a wonderful game' and admitted his 'surprise' at the margin of victory.

Referee: Jonas Eriksson (Sweden) Guardiola told Sky Sports Italia: 'We have a few things to improve and one of them is that we gave Roma too many chances at the start of the second half.' Bayern scored five times in the opening 35 minutes on their way to a record away win in Europe that left them top of Group E with maximum points. 'This game is an exception, an incident,' Guardiola acknowledged. 'It's not the difference between the two teams, we will see that in two weeks. 'We got a quick goal and that relaxed us, then we got another. Roma are a team who always play well, but we were very aggressive, made the right decisions and found space.' Bayern took a ninth-minute lead through Arjen Robben before strikes from Mario Gotze, Robert Lewandowski and Robben again put them 4-0 up by the half-hour. A Thomas Muller penalty extended the lead and, after Gervinho pulled one back, late goals from Franck Ribery and Xherdan Shaqiri completed the rout. Ashley Cole had a particularly chastening night and was taken off at half-time after being terrorised by former Chelsea team-mate Arjen Robben.

'The first person to make a mistake was myself. I got the strategy wrong. In the second half, we showed some pride and would have scored more goals if it hadn't been for their goalkeeper. 'Bayern have showed that they are stronger than us. We were spectators at the match, we should have been more aggressive and compact. 'We need to accept this defeat which shows how far we have to go to get close to the world's best teams. We can still qualify from this group, but not playing like this.'

Midfielder Daniele De Rossi said the difference between the sides was not as big as the scoreline suggested. 'It's a stab in the heart, the city and ourselves had waited so much for this game,' he said. 'There was a technical imbalance, they are stronger than us. But I don't think the difference is as big as the scoreline suggests. 'This defeat can be a lesson for the future and shows us that there is a long road ahead. We got a bit demoralised because all they did worked and nothing came off for us.' Goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis added: 'The only positive thing about this evening has been the behaviour of our fans.

"Cesc Fabregas saw the question coming from a hundred yards distance, and his answer was splendidly dismissive. ‘Do we feel invincible?’ he echoed. ‘This is a joke. Arsenal went unbeaten in 2003–4. That will never happen again.’ As a young player at Arsenal during that golden season, Fabregas is eminently qualified to make the judgment. But Chelsea have 22 points from the 24 available. The question will be repeated a time or two. His manager, Jose Mourinho, has been making the same response for most of October. And yet, after such a start, he is prepared to make cautious noises about the title. ‘If we were in another league, I’d say immediately, “Yes, we will do it”. In the Premier League, we “can” do it. But it’s hard to say we “will” do it. There’s a long way to go. There’s lots of good teams and difficult games in front of us. I’m pleased, but to win the title, it’s a long way away.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho has journalists in stitches, writing 'big balls' on notepad .

Ratings by JACK GAUGHAN at Selhurst Park . True, all true, but there is something in Chelsea’s attitude which provokes outrageous expectations. It is clear that titles are not won at places like Selhurst Park, although Chelsea might concede that they lost last season’s crown through defeat at Palace. They might also admit that Saturday's victory could have been much more emphatic had Mourinho not insisted on restraint rather than aggression when Palace were there for the taking. Finally, they might agree that their back four is suspiciously vulnerable to genuine pace, which could prove costly against more potent sides than the one they met. But, after making all those concessions, they will be satisfied with the three points they expected from a strangely eccentric match. Everything is falling into place for Mourinho’s team. Even when they lost Cesar Azpilicueta to a red card on 40 minutes, Damien Delaney obligingly committed a second bookable offence within two minutes to restore the numerical balance. Chelsea then settled to unchallenged control; good players doing the simple things to emphatic effect. Oscar’s stunning free- kick had given them the lead within six minutes, and when Fabregas drove in the second soon after the interval, their task seemed blessedly simple. And yet control did not yield further goals, and they endured the closing moments in a state of something akin to panic, when Palace substitute Wilfried Zaha created a tap-in for deserving Fraizer Campbell. The eventful afternoon ended in traditional fashion, with the Palace manager, Neil Warnock, on the pitch, bawling at the referee and even his oen players. The Palace fans had greeted their visitors with a cheery pre-match banner which read: ‘Roman’s dirty money is a disease that has plagued our game’. The tone having been set, Palace made a bright start, speedily deploying Campbell and Yannick Bolasie. But all the promise was deflated within six minutes when they conceded a free-kick 25 yards out. Oscar’s crashing strike reduced the chance to casual simplicity, the ball flying into the far top corner.

Oscar                     90           10.5     6.5 . On 28 minutes, John Terry became the latest to be defeated by the pace of Campbell, as he lunged hopefully and chopped him down. Referee Craig Pawson surprisingly decided against even a booking. Moments later, Delaney was booked for a similar assault upon Loic Remy, and the intensity of the match boiled over. The managers were inevitably involved; Mourinho playing to the crowd with his repertoire of expansive gestures, Warnock standing in his technical area, arms folded, white shirt clinging to paunch, bawling a stream of eye-bulging exhortations and looking like a noisy neighbour from a 1970s sit-com. The whole affair erupted, five minutes from half-time. Mile Jedinak won a ball near halfway, and Azpilicueta came lunging in, out of control. The referee rightly produced the red card. Willian was swiftly taken off, Filipe Luis came on, and Palace were required simply to get through to the interval. It was beyond them. Proving that the idiocy of footballers knows no bounds, Delaney needlessly grasped at Remy as the striker moved past. Having already been carded, he was off. Palace’s advantage had dissolved within two minutes, and Warnock’s rant as the referee left the pitch would have been better directed at his own absurd defender. Chelsea assumed assured control with the second half, their midfield dictating terms with some ease. And their command was reflected within six minutes when the endlessly influential Fabregas ran purposefully at a shuddering defence. He swapped passes with Eden Hazard and Oscar before striking his scoring drive with authority. A feeling of inevitability settled upon the stadium. There may be two or three teams in Europe who could hope to survive after donating Chelsea a two-goal lead. But Palace are not remotely among that number. The only genuine surprise came with the Palace goal, which saw substitute Zaha stepping nimbly along the byline to spread a perfect cross for Campbell’s eager acceptance. It was far too little, and much too late. They may not prove invincible, but the team which can beat them has yet to state its case.

"Gareth Southgate praised his England side for 'being prepared to pass the ball' even when things got tough after they saw off Croatia 4-2 on aggregate to progress to the 2015 European Championship in the Czech Republic. The Three Lions boss was impressed with his team's ability to keep hold of possession during their 2-1 play-off second-leg victory in Vinkovci on Tuesday. The game was evenly poised with the score 1-1 at half-time, but Southgate believes his players' bravery in continuing to press high and pass the ball saw England through. England qualified for the 2015 European Under 21 Championship with a 4-2 aggregate win over Croatia . England took the lead through Liam Moore (second left) in the first half in Vinkovci and never looked back . Goals from from Leicester City centre back Liam Moore and Derby County midfielder Liam Moore were enough to see the Three Lions safely advance to next June's tournament. And Southgate was even humorous in his own self-depreciation in the FA TV video, joking that maybe the England teams he played in struggled to keep the ball because he was in the side. And, speaking to the players in the dressing room after the game, Southgate said: 'You all take on board ideas. 'People say we couldn't play like that - I've not played in England teams who could keep the ball like that. It might have been because the centre back couldn't use it... 'But it's a f****** credit to you - you can go and you can change people's opinions of what we're about and what we're capable of doing.' Gareth Southgate: 'Listen, I think all I can say is that's how good you can be - that's how good you can be, OK? 'Everything we've asked you to do - not just tonight, but over the 12 months - you've responded to. Fantastic, everybody in the whole room it's been a credit. 'A pleasure to work with, you can take your hats off. You all take on board ideas. 'People say we couldn't play like that - I've not played in England teams who could keep the ball like that. It might have been because the centre back couldn't use it... 'But it's a f****** credit to you - you can go and you can change people's opinions of what we're about and what we're capable of doing. 'Now you get a chance to have a crack at the big boys. We'll prepare right, we'll make sure the games in between now and then really challenge us and really test us but you've come through two tough games there. 'That (game) could have gone either way couldn't it at half-time. If you hadn't been prepared to pass the ball and press high it could have been a different f****** story.

"He made his debut in the Premier League and played under Harry Redknapp, was kept out of the Sweden side by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, got out of Tel Aviv before mortars started landing and now shares a dressing room with a World Cup winner in India, where sacred cows are as big an obstacle as defenders. Meet Somerset lad James Keene, the striker who was touted for a call-up to the Swedish national team – his adopted country where he is a household name – but is now one of just three Englishmen playing in the new Indian Super League, which kicked off this week. Indeed, the 28-year-old starred as NorthEast United – including former Spain defender Joan Capdevila - opened with a 1-0 win over Kerala Blasters, for whom both Michael Chopra and Keene's former Portsmouth team-mate David James play. James Keene in action for NorthEast United in the inauguaral Indian Super League . Keene's NorthEast United team beat the Kerala Blasters in their opening match of the tournament . The eight-team league – where famous cricketers and Bollywood actors are club owners - runs until December and marquee names such as Alessandro Del Piero, Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg are expected to draw crowds totalling nearly three million over the course of the inaugural edition of the tournament. Last season, Keene was the only English player representing a foreign club in the Europa League or Champions League. In fact, he is Elfsborg’s top European scorer of all-time. But this in an altogether different challenge, on and off the pitch. Forget traffic jams on the M27 or clearing snow from your driveway in 24-hour darkness in Sweden, the journey to training in the city of Guwahati is like the tale of Noah’s Ark. ‘Getting around the place is mad – we’ve driven through floods, farmers walking their cows, goats, and sheep everywhere, 10 cars in two lanes, it’s crazy,’ says Keene, whose Swedish wife Catrine remains in Boras – just outside of Gothenburg - finishing her interior-design studies.

Former Liverpool star Luis Garcia (right) featured in Kolkata's win against Mumbai City in the opening game . Former Spain left back Joan Capdevila unveils NorthEast United's new strip . ‘But cows are Holy and you get a £400 fine if you hit one! I would never, ever drive here in my life and thankfully we have drivers. But they use their arms as indicators and never stop tooting the horn, it’s 24/7 – they use the horn more than the brake. ‘Then there will be a dad driving a moped with the mum on the back holding the two kids. Every car is ruined because they just hit each other all the time.’ So how did Keene end up in a cattle jam in India? A graduate of Portsmouth’s academy, he broke into the first team in 2005 before enjoying a goal-laden loan spell at GAIS in Sweden, managed by former Sheffield Wednesday defender Roland Nilsson, who once saved Keene by blasting the heaters in his car when the frostbitten rookie first arrived in the country. Keene at a NorthEast United training session in Guwahati with security guards . Hitting a cow in India could land you with a fine of £400 as they are the country's sacred animal . Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Champions Elfsborg made a permanent offer and he spent six seasons there, becoming fluent in Swedish, meeting his future wife and scoring enough goals to generate a clamour for nationalisation and a call-up. ‘Zlatan plays in my position though, and he’s not bad,’ he laughs when that subject is brought up. There was a loan period back at Pompey last year and a spell at Israel’s Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv before the offer of the ISL. ‘I loved Tel Aviv,’ he says. ‘It’s so vibrant and young. I was a bit nervous but the war was very calm while I was there. ‘My friend at Maccabi Tel-Aviv, Rade Prica, who played for Sunderland, he and his family had to be in a shelter for two weeks and it was chaos, he’s never experienced anything like it. ‘But thankfully we left just before all of that kicked off. Although when we first got to India it wasn’t easy. ‘Agents can make things sound very glamorous and we went to Shillong - a small village at the top of a mountain where one of the owners is from - to do some promotion work. ‘You’d be lucky if there were three bars, no internet and there was absolutely nothing to do. After three days Catrine went home!’ Now, however, Keene resides in a five-star luxury hotel. Although he admits the contrast between wealth and poverty is stark. ‘We’ve got a good training pitch and stadium. But that is the only good pitch in an area of five million people – the rest are terrible,’ he says. ‘Grassroots football just isn’t there. Cricket is fantastic – there are nets and pitches everywhere. ‘But this is the aim of the ISL – trying to get football out there to the kids. They are distributing hundreds of thousands of footballs. But I look out of my hotel window and see poverty. ‘Kids playing bare footed on a hard, mud pitch. Cows walk around on the street. The people don’t have proper clothes, they’re just wearing rags basically. It’s quite a dirty country and there is rubbish everywhere. Keene on his way to training in Guwahati as he makes his way through floods . ‘They don’t seem to care. When we finish training they just go and throw all of the water bottles in the river. ‘Just past our swimming pool are tin shelters where people live. The extremes here are massive. You feel sorry for the kids, they’re not even playing with a proper football. ‘But then they come to watch us train and they’re so happy to be there – it warms your heart.’ What about the football? Keene and Co are currently second and have two home games before a trip to Peter Reid’s Mumbai City. ‘You have to split the team – six international players and five Indian players,’ he explains. ‘The young Indian lads have a lot to learn. They only start playing when they’ re 15 so they don’t understand football like we do, like the concept of taking the ball to the corner if you’re winning late on. ‘But they’re improving, even in the five weeks I’ve been here they’ve got better. ‘Our first game was incredible, 35,000 people were there and it was live on TV (coverage can reach 650 million people). There were fireworks, bands and all sorts going on. The younger lads were a bit nervous but once we settled we did well and it was brilliant to win.’ Keene's Swedish wife Catrine is still back home in Boras, just outside Gothenburg . Keene and his wife Catrine in Sweden, where the footballer hopes to settle one day . Keene is not about to add Hindi to his CV, but with Capdevila, striker Koke and former Sporting Lisbon defender Miguel Garcia for comrades, he admits Spanish is an option. ‘Capdevila is amazing,’ he says. ‘There are so few footballers who have won a World Cup – to be sitting in a dressing-room with him is incredible. ‘After the first game we sat and had a beer together. We were laughing about how much media we’ve been doing to promote the league out here – he’s spent more time on a plane than he has on the pitch. It’s surreal.’ Does he, though, ever regret not pursuing a career within these shores? ‘When I left Portsmouth it was just to get some first-team football and try something different in a new country, it was exciting,’ he reflects. ‘But then they had their financial troubles and all of the young players got a chance in the Premier League. Marc Wilson, Asmir Begovic, the lads I played with, started to get an opportunity. Asmir Begovic was at Portsmouth at the same time as Keene and now plays for Stoke . ‘I do think, “What if?”. If I had stayed what could I have become? I was doing well, I was one of their best young players. Maybe if I’d stayed six months more things could have been very, very different. ‘But I love Sweden and the plan is to settle down there eventually and stay in the game in coaching. ‘My mum doesn’t know what to say about it all – she thinks I’m mad. But my dad thinks it’s brilliant and he tries to watch as many games as possible. ‘So I’ve no real regrets. I’ve played at a good level, I’ve seen the world and had so many experiences I wouldn’t have had if I’d stayed in England. I love it here.’ The car horns apart, Keene is having a blast.

Only two teams have ever scored more in a single Premier League game; Manchester United hit nine past Ipswich in 1995 and Tottenham did the same against Wigan in 2009. But this result added Ronald Koeman's Southampton into the pantheon of great performances. Even the Southampton manager admitted he was surprised by the result. 'I'm still a little bit in shock,' Koeman said afterwards. 'That is not a normal result. I was surprised after 20 minutes about the score; 2-0 up and we didn't start the game well. Sunderland were dominating and we had problems. 'The first 20 minutes it was very flat. But that's football and sometimes you're surprised how the game is changing. If you're asking me after 15 mins if it will be an easy win my answer would be no. 'In the end we played great football, we scored great goals and it was a great afternoon.' The tone was set for the afternoon when Santiago Vergini scored the own goal of the season in only the 11th minute. Sunderland's defender can surely not have struck a sweeter volley and the ball flew into the bottom-right corner past his own goalkeeper Vito Mannone. St Mary's Stadium was momentarily stunned into silence. An incredulous Gus Poyet was the most shocked. 'Even if you watch that 20 times you don't know how it can happen,' the Sunderland manager said. The home side doubled their lead on 18 minutes when Steven Davis ran down the left flank and sent in a low cross for Graziano Pelle, completely free, to continue his tremendous form with a tap in. Then, with similarly sloppy marking, it was three on 37 minutes. Jack Cork made a late run into the box and was not picked up, Dusan Tadic picked him out with a clipped ball from inside the box on the left and he forced the ball in. Substitute Liam Bridcutt added to Sunderland's embarrassment by sending the ball into his own net in the 62nd minute.

Pelle's shot was saved by Mannone but the ball squirmed into the path of Bridcutt, then squirmed between his feet, then squirmed over the line. If only Poyet had pointed his players in the right direction. It took only another seven minutes before Southampton made it five. This time Pelle made no mistake with his shot, running on to Tadic's through ball and sending a the ball across goal into the bottom left corner. That was his sixth goal in eight Premier League games since signing in the summer, celebrating in fitting style his player of the month award and scoring on his Italy debut during the international break. Southampton were as relentless as Sunderland were shocking and added another two goals in the space of a minute. Mannone played his part in Sunderland's comedy show, passing the ball straight to Tadic who sent it back past him and into the open net on 78 minutes.

The game could have been different had referee Andre Marriner awarded Sunderland a first-half penalty when Steven Fletcher was played through on goal by Lee Cattermole, knocked the ball past the on-rushing Fraser Forster then tumbled over the Southampton goalkeeper. It was still only 2-0 at that point. 'If the ref did his job, it's a penalty and a red card and maybe 2-1 and then we're talking about a different game,' Poyet explained. A Sunderland fan who had made the 650-mile round trip, across the whole country and back, was caught on camera sobbing by the end. No wonder, it was the first time they had conceded eight since September 1982 against Watford. 'I can't explain what happened,' Poyet added. 'I will let the players explain to you, maybe they will have better words. I don't. 'It's going to be a difficult week. The players who are on the pitch next week are going to do something about it.' Southampton's impressive form this season has seen them rise to third in the Premier League table, just one point behind the champions .

"Bayern Munich look set to smash their way to European domination over the next few years, with the club announcing record finances this week. Not content with being among the elite on the pitch, the German champions are now among the richest off it. Munich based magazine Focus reported on Sunday that the club had enjoyed a record financial year in the last 12 months. The report, which was later confirmed by the club itself, estimated Bayern's revenues at about £417million, with the club making a profit of around £13m. Star signings mean Bayern Munich have sold more shirts than the rest of the Bundesliga put together . Almost a fifth of their wealth comes from the sale of merchandise. Here, as on the pitch, Bayern lay waste to the rest of the Bundesliga. In the last year, the club sold around 1.7 million replica shirts: more than all the other Bundesliga clubs combined. It is not just Germany they want to dominate. According to economist Christian Weber, Bayern are now 'on a financial level with the likes of Real Madrid and Manchester United'. Unlike Madrid and United, of course, Bayern are not weighed down by crippling debts. Through a deal with insurance company Allianz, the club have even been able to pay off all the money owed for their stadium, fifteen years ahead of schedule. The latest financial results show Bayern are now on a level with clubs like Manchester United and Real Madrid . The club's long-term aim remains to be the richest club in world football by the year 2020. They are, however, already the club with the best finances. That is undoubtedly the result of sensible, long term planning from the likes of Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. But it has come at a certain price. Bayern sacrificed their status as an entirely member-owned club over a decade ago, and have since allowed in a growing number of investors, with Allianz the latest company welcomed to the fold. The insurance provider are now pushing to be given a seat on Bayern's board alongside fellow investors adidas and Audi. The vast majority of the club is still owned by the fans, however, and the vast majority of investment goes into the footballing side of things. Bayern's squad is worth around £450m pounds, and their wages are significantly higher than those of any other Bundesliga team. Bayern have Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Uli Hoeness to thank for their strong financial position . It is an unbelievable position of economic power, and one which Bayern now plan to turn into continuous on-field success. The Munich press are delighted, and have declared the record figures the start of a potential period of Bayern dominance in Europe. 'The attack on Europe can begin' wrote Focus, while Abendzeitung and TZ agreed with Bayern's finance boss Jans-Christian Dreesen, who declared last year that Bayern are 'a major European power'. The project to dominate Europe began with bringing in Pep Guardiola. Guardiola was not only told to win trophies, but also to give Bayern a long term footballing identity which will endure even after the Catalan has left. And the former Barcelona man receives a healthy sum of money to achieve that goal. One recent investigation from French magazine L'Équipe estimated Guardiola's salary to be around £13m, making him the highest paid manager in the world. Manager Pep Guardiola's salary is rumoured to be £13m, making it the highest managerial salary in the world . It remains a far cry from the Galacticos of Florentino Perez at Real Madrid. Bayern's transfer policy, while often costly, is based around creating a team in keeping with Guardiola's style, not about collecting superstars. As laudable as that is, however, fears remain that Bayern's rude financial health is only bad news for the rest of German football. Only Borussia Dortmund are growing at the same pace, and they are still a long way away from matching Bayern's power. Other clubs such as Schalke rely heavily on one particular investor or sponsor. There is little sign that anyone in Germany will topple Bayern at any time soon. The Reds are hoping that that will soon be true of the whole of Europe. The German club are primarily owned by their fans, but commercial investment is on the rise .

"Click here to read Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman  on Mario Balotelli's turbulent spell as a Manchester City player. Adam Lallana's shot was parried by Alex McCarthy in Queens Park Rangers's goal and the ball fell invitingly to Mario Balotelli with an open goal in front of him. The Liverpool striker was left with a simple tap-in, went to side-foot the ball into the net but it instead flew miles over the bar. That wasn't the first open goal he has missed this season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Head to head: Mario Balotelli vs Diego Costa . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers barks instructions at striker Mario Balotelli during the eventual win away at Queens Park Rangers . Balotelli - pictured sat on the turf with his head slumped - endured a difficult afternoon in front of goal at Loftus Road on Sunday . Midfielder Adam Lallana has words with the Italian front man during the last-gasp 3-2 win away at the Premier League's bottom club . Balotelli blazed over the bar from eight yards and did nothing to suggest he was going to make amends after the shocking miss . It looked far easier to score from this angle while the scores were still level just after the hour-mark in the capital . Scored just one goal in his last 22 Premier League appearances, despite attempting 73 shots (incl. blocked) in these games. Has now had 30 shots this season in the Premier League (incl. blocks). Only two players (Aguero 36, Pelle 32) have had more. Has attempted more shots (30, incl. blocked) without actually scoring than any other player in the top five European leagues this season. As if a flavour of things to come, in Balotelli's debut against Tottenham he did the same, albeit from further out. Hugo Lloris rushed from his line but spooned his clearance straight to the Liverpool player, who took a touch, steadied himself, then, 25 yards from goal, horribly skewed an effort wide. Brendan Rodgers clapped on the White Hart Lane touchline with a huge grin on his face. Balotelli has no goals in six league games and just a single goal against Bulgarian side Ludogorets - the joke is beginning to wear thin. That £16million price-tag is increasing in weight with every missed chance. This is a player who in 2010 only rated Lionel Messi above him, then in 2013 was gracious enough to add Cristiano Ronaldo to that list. 'When I score, I don't celebrate because I'm only doing my job. When a postman delivers letters, does he celebrate?' Balotelli asked in 2012. Loic Remy - who eventually left QPR for Chelsea - was available at half the price Liverpool ended up paying for Balotelli . Lallana talks to the 24-year-old on Sunday (left), but Balotelli cut a frustrated figure all afternoon for Rodgers' side . The striker was easily brushed aside by QPR defender Richard Dunne and failed to assert himself on proceedings throughout . Balotelli likened himself to a postman back in 2012, but Pat (pictured above) would fancy himself to deliver more regularly than Mario . Balotelli's heat map from the win - click here for more amazing stats . But postmen nearly always manage to get their deliveries through the letterbox. Surely if Pat spent two months wildly throwing letters at doors, leaving the streets strewn with unopened envelopes, before finally getting one in, he wouldn't hold back with at least a slight fist-pump. No player in Europe's top five leagues has had more shots without scoring than Balotelli's 30 this season. He added another seven against QPR on Sunday to reach that total and there is only one other Premier League game this season where a player has had more shots on goal without putting the ball in the back of the net. And that player was Balotelli. Against Everton, where he had 10 without reward in the Merseyside derby. Loic Remy was available for around £8m in the summer, mysteriously failing a medical at Liverpool which he then passed at Chelsea. He is languishing on the Stamford Bridge bench, while Balotelli is afforded plenty of minutes by Rodgers with little to show for it. With Daniel Sturridge ruled out for possibly another four weeks, Liverpool need a goal-scorer, a skill Remy has proved he has in the Premier League. Danny Welbeck was also available for the same price as Balotelli, but moved to Arsenal instead. In fact, plenty of forwards were up for grabs in the summer. Alexis Sanchez, Radamel Falcao and Samuel Eto'o all switched clubs, while Edinson Cavani was open to ending his difficult time at Paris Saint-Germain. Liverpool instead opted for Balotelli, but the transfer smacked of desperation. 'I can categorically tell you Mario Balotelli will not be at Liverpool,' Rodgers said ahead of their pre-season friendly against Manchester United in Miami at the beginning of August. Exactly three weeks later, with no replacement found for Luis Suarez, they had bought the player from AC Milan. It was a 'no-brainer,' Rodgers said. Balotelli got away with his misses against QPR. Richard Dunne and Steven Caulker both scored in their own net for Liverpool to win 3-2. Rodgers defended him, yet again, afterwards: 'The guy is doing his best and working really hard and it is not dropping for him. I'd say he would have finished that if Caulker had not put it in.' Unfortunately for Balotelli, Caulker did put it in and along with Dunne the QPR defenders have now scored more Premier League goals for Liverpool than him so far this campaign. Liverpool legend Jimmy Case gave a more brutal assessment: 'Mario Balotelli is a waste of space at the minute.' It is hard to disagree, at the minute. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"Ryan Bertrand is not sure what more he can do to earn an England recall. The 25-year-old left Chelsea in search of regular first-team football in the summer, joining Southampton on a season-long loan with a view to a permanent move. Ryan Bertrand has helped Southampton make a sensational start to the season . It has proved an excellent decision, with Bertrand's fine form key to Saints confounding the doubters with an extraordinary start to the campaign. Ronald Koeman's side have the best defensive record in English football and sit second in the Premier League heading into the international break - a period the left-back will spend at the club's New Forest training base. Bertrand has again been overlooked by Roy Hodgson for England's upcoming matches and is not sure what more he can do to impress the man who gave him his only two senior caps in 2012. Bertrand left Chelsea in search of regular first-team football in the summer . 'It will be quiet here these next two weeks, but it's a chance for those of us who are left out, like me, to work on things and come back flying again,' he said. 'Yeah, [I'm] very [disappointed]. I've started very well this season, we're second in the league, so I don't know what the criteria is to get in there at the minute.' Missing out will no doubt be all the more galling to Bertrand given Saints team-mates Nathaniel Clyne and Fraser Forster have been deemed worthy of call-ups. Saints defender Nathaniel Clyne was called up by England boss Roy Hodgson . Asked if he feels he will get another chance with England if he keeps performing, he said: 'Yeah, definitely. That's what I thought. But, at the end of the day, it's not down to me. 'I feel like I should have achieved that already, so hopefully it will come.'","Ryan Bertrand's fine form has been key to Southampton success .

"Ched Evans left prison early on Friday morning after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel. But a bouncy castle hired to celebrate his return home was seemingly cancelled at the last minute by his family. A van containing a bouncy castle and a marquee was sent away from the family home in North Wales on Friday afternoon. Earlier in the day, under the cover of darkness, at 4.58am, a silver Mercedes ML 4x4 was seen pulling up outside Wymott Prison near Leyland, Lancashire. A 4x4 carrying convicted rapist Ched Evans leaves Wymott Prison in Lancashire at 5am . The Welsh footballer, who last played for Sheffield United, has served half his five-year sentence for rape . A van containing a bouncy castle and a marquee had pulled up outside the family home in North Wales, and the bouncy castle allegedly went into the house before being removed and taken away . Family and friends arrived at Evans' mother's house in North Wales following his release . Sheffield United continued to pay Ched Evans after he was convicted of rape. Football clubs can terminate a player’s contract, sacking them on the grounds of gross misconduct if they are found guilty of a criminal offence. But Sportsmail understands that officials at Bramall Lane honoured the remaining few months of Evans’ £20,000-per-week contract after he was imprisoned in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old girl. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY . Evans was seen getting into the back of the car which had blacked out windows and the vehicle left in a matter of seconds. An onlooker said: 'It was a synchronised movement. The Mercedes turned up and then parked up down the road. It then reversed back at speed towards the jail exit. 'Then the prison door opened and the back door of the car opened. Ched then dived in the back and the car sped off.' The striker, 25, was jailed in April 2012 for raping the woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. Evans' release will pile more pressure on his former club, Sheffield United, to say whether he will be allowed to play for them again. Many Blades fans have called for him to be rehabilitated, but almost 150,000 people have signed an online petition urging the Bramall Lane club not to welcome him back. But in a 600-word statement, Evans's family hit out at the organisers of the petition and the media for what they claim was 'sensationalist and often factually incorrect' reporting of the case. The statement, posted on a website set up to clear the Wales striker's name, said they had always sought to satisfy an 'insatiable and hungry media society' with interviews proclaiming his innocence. Evans (right) pictured on a night out with his family, who have lashed out after days of debate over whether he should be allowed to play again . The footballer, who had been playing for Sheffield United, with his girlfriend Natasha Massey . In a statement released on his website on Friday, Evans' family announced their intention to launch another appeal to overturn the conviction. It reads: 'Chedwyn Evans maintains his absolute innocence and his family, friends and many who know the true facts of the case believe that his conviction was a gross miscarriage of justice. 'On 15 July 2014 Ched’s new legal team David Emanuel of Garden Court Chambers London and Shaun Draycott submitted an application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission which is the first step to a second appeal. They are confident in their submission. 'We believe that due to Ched’s profession, information that was not used by his original defence and other information that has been gathered since his conviction will in time overturn a wrongful conviction. 'For those who only read the media reports, this website endeavours to redress the balance by presenting the evidence in a balanced and accurate manner so that the public can assess the salient facts and make their own judgement. 'From the outset we would like to state that this website in no way seeks to undermine the seriousness of rape or trivialise the suffering that rape victims suffer. We recognise that rape is a terrible crime which, if committed, ought to carry a severe sentence. 'This website is not about the severity of the sentence, we are stating that Ched did not commit the crime of rape at all. Furthermore, we recognise and acknowledge that in rape cases the anonymity of the victim is a fundamental legal principle that should be upheld and respected.' Evans in action for Sheffield United in a derby match with Sheffield Wednesday in 2009 . Evans playing for Wales in an international friendly match with Scotland in November 2009 . VIDEO Ched Evans released from prison . Evans denied the offence but was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court. He admitted having sex with her, but the woman told the jury she had no memory of the incident. The prosecution said the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was too drunk to consent to sexual intercourse. Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald also admitted having sex with the victim but was found not guilty of the same charge. An appeal against Evans's conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. His girlfriend, Natasha Massey, has led a campaign to have the conviction overturned. Evans's case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Case Review Commission in the coming weeks. Miss Massey has reiterated her support for her partner telling ITV's This Morning that she put her feelings about his cheating to one side to support him through his trial and prison and she said she has visited him every week in prison. Miss Massey said Evans hopes to play professional football again. Sheffield United have refused to say whether they will allow Evans to play again. Kylie Evans (left), the sister of rapist Ched Evans (right), leaving Wymott Prison in Lancashire on Thursday . Manager Nigel Clough has said: 'We have had one or two discussions, we are awaiting a decision and the owners will make that in good time.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the owners of Sheffield United should 'think really long and hard' before deciding whether to allow Evans back. Mr Clegg said footballers were role models to youngsters and that should 'weigh heavily' on the club's owners. The Liberal Democrat leader and Sheffield Hallam MP said: 'I don't think it's right for politicians to tell football clubs what they will do and who they employ. All I'm saying is I think football players these days, they get paid a lot of money, they are public figures and you can't ignore that.' Wymott Prison, near Leyland in Lancashire, where Ched Evans was held . Richard Caborn, the former sports minister and a Sheffield United fan, said Evans should be allowed back only if he shows remorse and says sorry. Labour sports spokesman Clive Efford said it was 'not appropriate' for Evans to return to professional football after his release. Mr Efford told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think there are many areas of employment where, when you've committed a crime like that, you are not allowed to be employed in that form of employment, and I think football is one of them, because you are a role model within a community. 'I know this is sad for Ched Evans, who's been to prison and paid a price, but I think that in these circumstances it's not appropriate to have someone with that record in a profession where you are idolised by young people.' Evans scored 48 goals in 113 games for the Blades before his imprisonment, including 35 in 42 games during the 2011-12 campaign which was cut short for him due to his trial and conviction. He has been capped 13 times by Wales.","Ched Evans, 25, jumped into silver 4x4 before 5am and was driven away .

"Joey Barton has given his version of events between him and  Zlatan Ibrahimovic last season when the then-Marseille midfielder gestured that the PSG striker had a big nose. Barton reveals he was instructed to get under the Sweden international's skin by ex-Marseille manager Elie Baup, and that he and Ibrahimovic were simply exchanging taunts. Barton insists he was unaware that cameras would catch him, but defends his infamous act in February 2013 by saying he 'just told him the truth'. Joey Barton pictured during his time with Marseille in Ligue 1 where he did his infamous nose gesture . Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Barton were exchanging taunts and the latter gestured that he had a 'huge nose' Telling French newspaper L'Equipe, Barton said: 'Before the game, Elie Baup told me to get under Zlatan’s skin, to stop him from turning too easily and controlling aerial balls from their goalkeeper. ‘I was winning loads of free kicks, because he was making foul after foul. 'So he said to me: ""You play hard, so stay on your feet"", so I told him, laughing ""Yeah, just stop making stupid fouls."" 'Then he called me an English so-and-so, so I replied: ""Yeah, I’m English, but you’ve got a huge nose"", and I did the gesture showing his huge nose. Ibrahimovic apparently called Barton an 'English so-and-so' and the QPR midfielder replied about his nose . 'I didn’t think anyone would notice because the ball was far away, I thought that would be the end of it. 'But then for weeks after, all the kids in Marseille were coming up to me doing the nose gesture! I was like, ""Whoa, everyone saw!"" It was quite funny. 'As for that moment, Zlatan was surprised, because he’s Zlatan and no one ever says anything to him. 'But at the end of the day, I just told him the truth: Zlatan is a great player, and he has a huge nose.'

"Sir Dave Brailsford is open to the idea of a showdown between the best cyclists on the planet, but stopped short of accepting Oleg Tinkov's challenge for the four best riders to contest all three Grand Tours in 2015 for one million euros. The eccentric Russian would like to see Alberto Contador, who rides for his Tinkoff-Saxo squad, Team Sky's Chris Froome, Astana's Vincenzo Nibali and Nairo Quintana of Movistar race in the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a Espana in the same year. The one million euros (£788,966) purse could be divided equally, or be awarded as a prize to the rider who places best at the Tours of Italy, France and Spain. Chris Froome, of Great Britain and Team Sky, leads Alberto Contador during the 2013 Tour de France . Sir Dave Brailsford is open to a showdown, but stopped short of accepting Oleg Tinkov's €1 million challenge . Tinkov owns Tinkoff-Saxo, the team Contador rides for, and wants a €1 million Grand Tour Challenge . Team Sky principal Brailsford, speaking at the Leaders in Sport conference in London, said: 'I like the attitude, I must say. I think we'd all agree that seeing the best riders slug it out across the season at key races is what everybody would want to see. 'If you could bring an added element to it of a bit more of a narrative throughout the season rather than just a one-off race then I think I'd be behind that. 'I think it's all about getting the best riders racing together in the best and biggest races.' Many cycling fans are relishing the 2015 Tour de France, where the quartet are expected to meet to contest for the yellow jersey won by Nibali in 2014. The route of the Giro d'Italia, announced earlier this week, suggested a Giro-Tour double might be possible, but few riders ride three Grand Tours in a calendar year, let alone contest for the overall victory at them. Froome (centre) pictured riding during the second stage of the 2014 Tour de France . Luke Rowe of Great Britain leads Froome through Ponferrada during the UCI Road World Championships . 'From a performance point of view, it's quite a serious undertaking,' Brailsford added. 'But, from a conceptual point of view, I'm sure from a fan's point of view, from a sporting point of view, I think it's got a lot of merit.' There will be concerns a sport which has endeavoured to tackle the use of performance-enhancing drugs will be leaving itself susceptible to abuse if such a gruelling challenge is contemplated. Tinkov called for his gruelling idea to be adopted in an interview with Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport and then took to Twitter to 'call out' Contador's rivals publicly, including addressing Brailsford. Tinkov wrote: '@davebrailsford @chrisfroome @vincenzonibali @NairoQuintana dont be a chiken (sic)! #Real3GTChallenge' Brailsford will reserve full comment on the suggestion until the Tour de France route is announced in Paris later this month.

"England were unable to make a major statement ahead of the World Cup next year and defeat the defending champion New Zealanders but they pushed the visitors to the last at Twickenham. While Stuart Lancaster's side got the better of the first half, taking a 14-11 lead to the break, the All Blacks' quality showed in the second half as they pulled ahead with a late converted try flattering the hosts on the scoreboard. Sportsmail's Sam Peters was at Twickenham and rates the players' performances. Star man Richie McCaw celebrates his second-half try in New Zealand's win over England at Twickenham . ENGLAND . Mike Brown - 6 . Has not been in his best form for Harlequins but was excellent on Saturday apart from one scuffed clearance kick. A top-class international. Semesa Rokoduguni (replaced by Anthony Watson 62) - 7 . Targeted defensively by the All Blacks but looked composed and calm under pressure. Tackled superbly and marshalled Savea well. Brad Barritt - 8 . England’s unsung centre showed precisely why Lancaster and his coaches have so much faith in him. Defensively rock-solid and his floated pass set May clear. Kyle Eastmond (George Ford 65) - 7 . One charged down clearance kick almost led to All Black try but otherwise this was a promising performance from the rugby league convert. Jonny May - 8 . A try after three minutes which will live long in the memory for anyone who witnessed it. His best display in an England shirt. England winger Jonny May burns All Blacks full back Israel Dagg on the outside for the opening try . Owen Farrell - 6 . Finished the game with a blood streaming down his face. Total commitment but starved of second-half possession as New Zealand took charge. Danny Care (Ben Youngs 62 mins) - 7 . A couple of sharp jinking runs from England’s first-choice No9. Is forging a strong half-back partnership with Farrell which should take England to World Cup. Joe Marler (Matt Mullan 55) - 7 . Scrummaged well and tackled himself to a standstill. Few opportunities with ball in hand but a solid shift at the coalface. Owen Farrell (eft) was starved at fly half in the second half as the All Blacks dominated possession . Hartley (Rob Webber 73) - 7 . Wound up opposite man Ben Coles to the extent of him lashing out and being sin binned. Terrific work rate and solid in the set piece. Wilson (Kieran Brookes 73) - 7 . Took a fearful hit from Sonny Bill Williams in first half but regained his composure and proceeded to make an impressive contribution. Dave Attwood - 8 . Only a third international start for the new dad but looked a seasoned campaigner. Dominant in the line out and superb in the loose. Dave Attwood (top) wins a closely contested line-out for England in an impressive performance . Courtney Lawes (George Kruis 23) - 6 . Full of endeavour but missed a vital tackle in lead up to first All Black try before departing with suspected concussion. Tom Wood - 6 . Typically high work-rate from one of England’s leaders and reasonably effective at the breakdown. Needs to carry more. Chris Robshaw (c) - 7 . Industrious and utterly committed but it was hard not to draw comparisons with opposite man McCaw. Should he play blindside? Billy Vunipola (Ben Morgan 53 mins) - 7 . A couple of frustrating turnovers but carried the ball with menace and caused dents in the All Black defence. Impressive work-rate. Captain Chris Robshaw (left) leads a disappointed England side off the field after their narrow defeat . NEW ZEALAND . Israel Dagg - 6 . Completely flat footed for May’s early try and not at his most effective with ball in hand. Still a threat even on quiet days. Ben Smith - 7 . Didn’t see a great deal of possession but one wonderful take from a high ball reminded us of his class. Sound defensively. Conrad Smith (Ryan Crotty 48) - 6 . Uncharacteristically exposed defensively for May’s first-half try and struggled to gain a foothold in the game with limited possession. McCaw holds the Hillary Shield, the trophy England and New Zealand have played for since 2008 . Sonny-Bill Williams - 7 . Carried the ball with real menace but was generally well marshalled by his diminutive opposite man Eastmond. A couple of trademark big hits. Julian Savea - 7 . Didn’t see as much ball as he would have liked but was a threat every time he had it. A couple of thundering early hits on Rokoduguni. Aaron Cruden (Beauden Barrett 60) - 8 . Radar not finely tuned in front of goal but looked sharp with ball in hand. Would have wanted more possession to set his backs free. Aaron Smith (TJ Perenara 66) - 7 . Tidy, composed and assured in the best tradition of All Black No9s. Does not possess electric pace but makes few mistakes. Wyatt Crockett (Ben Franks 60) - 7 . Solid scrummaging display and sound all-round contribution from a high-class operator who rarely takes a backward step. Dane Coles - 7 . Can consider himself unfortunate to have been sin binned after being wound up by Hartley. High work-rate and technically excellent. While his kicking wasn't brilliant Aaron Cruden was sharp with the ball in hand for the All Blacks . Owen Franks (Charlie Faumuina 48) - 6 . His powerful charge led to McCaw’s early second-half try but was under pressure in the few scrums he was required for. Brodie Retallick (Patrick Tuipuluto 40) - 6 . Solid if unspectacular. Worked hard and ran the line out efficiently before departing at half time. Tidy and effective. Sam Whitelock- 7 . Under pressure in the lineout but produces so much quality around the pitch. An outstanding performer. Jerome Kaino (Liam Messam 67) - 7 . Some thunderous tackling and powerful carrying from the All Blacks’ hulking blindside. Consistently effective. Kieran Read - 7 . Still yet to show his very best at Twickenham but made few mistakes and was a constant worry for England. Carried effectively without fireworks. Richie McCaw - 9 . Didn’t always see eye-to-eye with referee Owens but still showed enough class to remind why he is one of the greatest ever players.

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes striker Diego Costa can now put his injury problems behind him and will be back in prime condition when the Premier League resumes after the international break. The Spain international has been plagued by hamstring and pelvic injuries since joining from Atletico Madrid for £32million but that has not stopped him scoring 10 goals already, including the winner in the 2-1 victory against Liverpool on Saturday. Costa has been left out of the national squad for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Belarus next week and a friendly against Germany three days later. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is delighted striker Diego Costa is being rested by the Spain national team . Costa scored the winner in Chelsea's 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield in the Premier League on Saturday . Costa has been troubled with a hamstring problem all season, but Mourinho feels the rest will be a big help . By the time the league campaign resumes at home to West Brom on November 22, Mourinho expects his star man to be firing on all cylinders. 'I think Spain made a fantastic decision not just for us but for them,' he said. 'He has 15 days to get to the top of his game and when they need him they will get a good Diego not a bad one. 'Maybe the injury was good because it stopped him. When he became injured he had time to recover, step-by-step, and at this moment he is in a good condition.' Mourinho also hopes the international break will give midfielders Cesc Fabregas and Ramires time to recover from hamstring and abductor problems respectively after risking them at Anfield. 'I need to give credit to them - they both played injured, risked everything to play,' he added. Mourinho said Ramires (left) and Cesc Fabregas (right) both played against Liverpool with injuries . 'Fabregas gambled and I gambled. He can join up with Spain but he will be back (as he is not fit).' Unbeaten Chelsea maintained their four-point lead at the top of the table with a ninth win in 11 matches and stretched a remarkable 15 points ahead of Liverpool, runners-up last season. The Reds were not realistically expected to contend this campaign but even without them in the running, Mourinho knows there is plenty to be done before his team can even entertain thoughts of the title. 'If this was the Spanish, Portuguese or German league where you have two teams competing to be champion, if you leave one team 15 points behind you are almost there but this is England and every match is difficult,' he added. 'It is not about Liverpool, there is Man City, Arsenal, Tottenham, Southampton. 'We are in a good situation, we have already played the four matches in Liverpool and Manchester, four very difficult matches away, but it is the beginning of November so there is a long way to go.' Emre Can (above) put Liverpool 1-0 up against Chelsea with his first goal for the club in the ninth minute . Gary Cahill (above) equalised five minutes later with a goal that needed confirming through goal-line technology . If Chelsea have a long way to go, Liverpool's task is even more onerous as a fifth defeat of the season - and third in a week after reverses at Newcastle and Real Madrid - leaves manager Brendan Rodgers with some difficult questions to ask himself and his players. The decision to rest key players in Madrid, making seven changes, did not pay off in terms of a result against Chelsea. 'Obviously there is pressure on when you don't get the result but I can only refocus now and it is important we get back to winning ways after the international break,' said the Reds boss. 'It is a difficult moment for us as we're not getting the results and it has been a tough week really. 'Our focus is getting into that top four with the considerable change we have and we still have a big possibility to do that.' Brendan Rodgers looks on as his Liverpool team lose for the third time in their last three games . With little goal threat to trouble the leaders, the return of striker Daniel Sturridge, who has not been seen in a red shirt since August 31 because of thigh and calf injuries, cannot come soon enough. He is expected to be ready for the trip to Crystal Palace on November 23. 'The break comes at a good time for us. We are hoping to get one or two injuries back after that and then we have to look to get on a run,' added Rodgers. 'It has been a long time now (without Sturridge). We are hoping he can now get to work because he hasn't trained with the team at all in the time off. Daniel Sturridge missed Saturday's game through injury and Rodgers hopes his return will improve Liverpool . 'Hopefully over the course of the next couple of weeks he can be out there training and we will have him back, which will be important as he has had a big impact for us.' Emre Can's first goal for the club since his £10million summer move from Bayer Leverkusen gave Liverpool the ideal start - with the aid of a huge deflection off Gary Cahill but the Chelsea defender got himself back in credit by bundling the ball over at a corner for the equaliser, which required the assistance of the goal decision system. Costa displayed his clinical best with a sweet first-time strike to drill home Cesar Azpilicueta's cross, although Liverpool had a fair shout for a penalty ignored late on when the ball appeared to strike Cahill's arm.","Striker Diego Costa has been hampered by a hamstring issue this season .
Jose Mourinho hopes the 15-day break he has will allow him to overcome it .
Brendan Rodgers feels Daniel Sturridge's return is essential for Liverpool ."
"Australians are forking out hundreds of dollars on unnecessary credit card interest with the big four banks when they could be getting a better deal by using any of 20 other cards on the market. ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac still charge around 20 per cent interest on credit cards but consumers can reduce their purchase interest rate by more than 10 per cent by ditching their products, a review of credit cards by consumer advocacy group CHOICE claims. People sign up for credit cards with the big four because they 'automatically think they will get the best deal', CHOICE spokesman Tom Godfrey told Daily Mail Australia. According to the RBA, in August 2014 the average high rate credit card charges 19.75 per cent, while the best rate on offer is 8.99 per cent through Community First McGrath Pink Visa and Low rate visa. Scroll down for video . Consumers can reduce their purchase interest rate by more than 10 per cent by ditching credit cards supplied by the big four banks ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac . Victoria Teachers Mutual Bank Visa Platinum, Maritime, Mining and Power Credit Union Visa and Bank Mecu then come in at 9.99 per cent, 10.12 and 10.14 respectively. For someone with a $2000 debt, paying off $50 a month with the average high rate credit card with a 19.75 per cent interest rate, it will take five years and six months and they will pay $1,289 in interest. However, they could save $903 on the same debt by switching to a credit card with an interest rate of 8.99 per cent - offered by credit union Community First McGrath Pink Visa and Low rate visa. With this card - the number one in Australia for low purchase interest - it will only take four years to pay off the same amount and they will only pay $386 in interest. The credit cards with the lowest purchase rates  in Australia are offered by credit unions. Community First, McGrath Pink Visa: 8.99% . Victoria Teachers Mutual Bank: 9.99% . Maritime, Mining & Power Credit Union: 10.12% . Bankmecu: 10.14% . The big four's 'low-rate' cards have an interest rate of 14 per cent. But Mr Godfrey says 'they are still a long way from the best deals on offer'. ANZ Low Rate: 13.49% . CBA Low Rate Credit Card: 13.49% . NAB's Low Rate Card: 13.99% . Westpac Low Rate Credit Card: 13.49% . The advocacy group has named the top 20 credit cards on the market and surprisingly the big four banks are nowhere to be seen on the list. Mr Godfrey said people stay with the top four for their credit cards because of a 'perceived trust' and also because they have their other banking facilities, such as their mortgage, with those banks. 'With the big four we've got to separate credit cards from those other products - you've got to focus on the interest rate and research the best deal,' he explained. The best rate on offer is 8.99 per cent through Community First McGrath Pink Visa and Low rate visa . Bank Mecu (left) and Maritime, Mining & Power Credit Union (right) also offer low rates at around 10 per cent . Mr Godfrey reasoned that the best interest rates on credit cards are actually offered by credit unions not the main banks. 'Australians are bombarded with advertising from the big four banks and what this shows is the best rates are offered by credit unions and with the top card you are also giving money to charity, it's a very good deal indeed,' Mr Godfrey said. He advised that if you really want to stay with a major bank they should call and ask for a better rate. 'Don't assume the first product they offer will be best product, you need to go in there and do your homework first. Push them for a better rate particularly if you are carrying a balance forward,' Mr Godfrey said. Australia's big four banks are nowhere to be seen in a new list of the top 20 credit cards on the market . Earlier this year it was revealed 19 per cent of Australians are living off their credit card to get through to pay day. 'They should be called debt cards. You should try to pay them off as soon as possible. If you do have more than one card then it's really good to get free advice from a financial counsellor,' Mr Godfrey advised. • Find out what interest rate you are paying on your credit card . • If your interest rate is 14% or more it’s time to switch . • If you want to stay with a major bank call them and ask for a better rate . • Create a direct debit to pay as much as you can but at least the minimum payment each month to avoid late fees and a listing on your credit report . • Every dollar extra above the minimum balance saves you interest. Consumers should carry out their own research to find out what card is best for them.

"The decisive moments of the 2015 Tour de France will take place at Alpe d’Huez after the route of the 102nd edition of the race was unveiled in Paris on Wednesday. The Tour, which begins in Utrecht on July 4, promises to be thrilling, with defending champion Vincenzo Nibali, 2013 winner Chris Froome, two-time winner Alberto Contador and Giro d’Italia winner Nairo Quintana all chasing the yellow jersey. The race concludes in Paris on July 26, after travelling through Holland and Belgium, continuing to commemorate World War One in northern France and then travelling to north western France. The route for the 102nd edition of the Tour de France was revealed in Paris on Wednesday . The participants in the 2015 race will be hoping to emulate this year's winner, Vincenzo Nibali of Italy . There is a long transfer to the Pyrenees, but the decisive moments will take place in the Alps. The penultimate stage will conclude with the ascent to Alpe d’Huez, with its fabled 21 hairpin bends, before the ceremonial finish in Paris. The 101st Tour began in Yorkshire last July, with Froome and Contador among those to crash out during an attritional race which Nibali dominated. Jean-Christophe Peraud and Thibaut Pinot reached the podium, the first Frenchmen to do so since 1997. Froome was not in Paris for the team presentation, instead he was sailing in Weymouth with the British Sailing squad on a Team Sky training camp. Britain's Chris Froome, the 2013 winner, will be hoping to regain his crown after pulling out of the 2014 race through injury . The 2015 race will, as is tradition, finish on the Champs Elysee in Paris. 2014 winner Vincenzo Nibali is seen passing the Arc de Triomphe . And there is no guarantee Froome will ride the Tour, with the possibility he could target May’s Giro d’Italia and August’s Vuelta a Espana instead. The 29-year-old Kenya-born Briton said on chris-froome.com: “The team and I will have to give it some careful consideration before we make any commitments to which of the grand tours I will compete in. “I see myself as quite a balanced GC (general classification) rider and the Giro with it’s inclusion of a long TT (time-trial) of 60km and tough uphill finishes will make it a well balanced race which suits me well. “If I did the Giro I may also be able to get myself back to top shape for the Vuelta and go there with a realistic chance of aiming for the win. “Next year’s Tour is going to be about the mountains. There’s very little emphasis on time-trialling which means the race will be decided up in the high mountains. “With six mountaintop finishes it is going to be an aggressive and massively demanding race.”","The route for the 2015 edition of the Tour de France has been unveiled in Paris .

"Four British have men appeared in court accused of a plot to smuggle £100  million  of cocaine into the UK. Stephen Powell, 47, was arrested following the seizure  of about a ton of cocaine on a yacht Makayabella last week. The vessel was detained 200 miles off south-west Ireland in an operation involving the Irish Naval Service and Britain’s National Crime Agency. Powell, of Guiseley, Leeds, was remanded in custody by Leeds magistrates yesterday, the NCA said. He will next appear at Leeds Crown Court on October 13. Three men detained on board the yacht – including Powell’s father John, 70 – have been remanded in custody in Ireland. Investigators yesterday also seized the 25ft motorboat Sea Breeze in Pwllheli, Gwynedd . The . 25ft Sea Breeze was to be used to ferry bales of the narcotics from the Makayabella yacht onto UK shores, an . evasion tactic known as coopering, it is believed. Three . men - a 70-year-old skipper and two others, aged 35 and 28 from West . Yorkshire - are being held in Ireland after being found onboard the 60ft . vessel when armed navy teams stormed it 200 nautical miles off the . Irish coast early on Tuesday morning. Scroll down for video . Police lead away the skipper of the Makayabella after it was seized on the way past Ireland .

Customs officials aboard the yacht Makayabella in Haulbowline naval base, Cobh, Co Cork after the Irish Navy intercepted the vessel suspected of carrying around £100million worth of cocaine . Two others, aged 43 and 47, were arrested in follow-up raids in west Yorkshire on suspicion of involvement. Some 41 bales of cocaine, bound for the north of England, were offloaded from the vessel in Cork harbour yesterday. Detectives . from the UK’s National Crime Agency today recovered the Sea Breeze at a marina at Pwllheli, a small coastal town on the . Llyn Peninsula in Gwynedd. It is now being forensically examined. Commander . David Norris, of the crime agency, who is leading the investigation, said they . have been granted more time to question the 47-year-old suspect still in . custody in the UK. He . said: 'This has been a complex and fast-moving investigation, involving . law enforcement agencies in the UK, Ireland, Europe and South America.' The yacht has been tracked by authorities in several countries as it left Venezuela, stopping off in Trinidad, before being stormed by an elite Navy squad 200 nautical miles off Mizen Head - Ireland's most southerly point . He said police wanted to speak with one other man in connection with the crime, a 29-year-old man from the Halton . Moor area of Leeds, and encouraged him to 'contact us'. Authorities say the . Makayabella was skippered . through its weeks-long Atlantic voyage by an old-age pensioner from West . Yorkshire. The . 70-year-old British suspect was arrested aboard the 60ft Makayabella . along with two other men, allegedly with bales of . cocaine so big they used them as makeshift furniture. The 70-year-old is believed to have been an experienced sailor. The smugglers are believed to have planned to transfer the cocaine onto a smaller boat at sea before ferrying it to shore in North Wales. Under armed guard yesterday, the one tonne haul of drugs was offloaded from the yacht onto the docks at Haulbowline naval base in Cork harbour, where it was towed to last night. Members of the navy stand with the haul of cocaine thought to be worth in the region of £100million. If that value is confirmed it will be one of the biggest drug seizures in Europe this year. Closing in: The patrol vessel LE Niamh tails the yacht Makayabella . The yacht . was tracked by authorities in several countries as it left Venezuela, . stopping off in Trinidad, before being intercepted 200 nautical miles . off Mizen Head - Ireland's most southerly point. During . the tense night-time sea raid, two teams set off from the coastal . patrol vessel LE Niamh on smaller inflatable boats, armed with pistols . and batons. Captain . David Barry of the Irish Navy said it was a 'particularly dark night' and he believed those on board the Makayabella had  'no idea we were . there until we were actually on board'. The crew put up no resistance and no arms were found on board. The men on board the yacht put up no resistance to the armed Irish Navy team . The yacht Makayabella is led into Haulbowline naval base, Cobh, Co Cork . The passage . around the south-west coast of Ireland has been well used in recent . times by drugs smugglers bringing shipments from South America and . Africa into Europe. Authorities describe it as the western frontier of Europe. In . 2007, a record £344 million of cocaine was seized in Dunlough Bay in . west Cork when a UK gang botched an attempt to bring the massive haul . ashore on a smaller boat and capsized in rough weather. Most of the group, including two Englishmen, were arrested in follow-up operations and eventually given lengthy prison sentences. Just a year later, a £312 million haul was intercepted on the Dances With Waves yacht about 150 miles off Mizen Head. Three British men on board were later jailed for 10 years each for their part in the plot. The mastermind, John Alan Brooks, was jailed for 28 years for the plot to bring the massive haul to England from Venezuela.","The Sea Breeze was to be used to ferry drugs onto UK shores .

The internet entrepreneur, who is worth around $33 billion, has bought a total of 700 acres on Kauai's North Shore in his latest leap up the property ladder. The purchase includes Pila'a Beach - an isolated 393-acre swathe of land with a pristine white sand beach - and the adjacent a 357-acre Kahu'aina Plantation. Scroll down for video .

It is thought that Zuckerberg, 30, has paid around $66 million for the Kahu'aina Plantation and $49.6 million for Pila'a Beach, according to Pacific Business News. The Pila'a Beach property consists of five separate parcels, each which could be developed into private homes. Further homes could also be built on the Kahu'aina Plantation. But sources told Forbes that the billionaire intends to build just one secluded property. The purchase includes Pila'a Beach - an isolated 393-acre swathe of land with a pristine white sand beach - and the adjacent a 357-acre Kahu'aina Plantation .

"Two orphaned wallaby joeys are getting to know each other and could soon become playmates after being rescued from the roadside. The  female swamp joeys named Khaleesi and Alkira are Sydney Taronga Zoo’s newest additions to the family. Zookeepers Jodie Carr and Matt Dea have taken on the role of surrogate parents after the joey's mothers were both struck by a car and killed. But the furry little creatures have been receiving round-the-clock care and keeping everyone busy while melting the zookeepers hearts. Scroll down for video . Two female joeys named Khaleesi and Alkira enjoyed a brief introduction this week alongside their surrogate parents . Ms Carr said the pair could soon be put into a crèche together to socialise and play during the day, as they grow and become more independent. ‘Khaleesi is already incredibly confident. She’s starting to hop out of her makeshift pouch for a quick bound around the bedroom at 3am,’ she said. Ms Carr has been hand-raising baby Khaleesi for the past month after she was found in her dead mother’s pouch on the side of the road at Beacon Hill in Sydney’s north-east. ‘She had a few little scrapes on her feet, but otherwise she was in good health,’ Ms Carr said. Surrogate parents Jodie Carr (left) and Matt Dea (right) have been hand-raising the pair and carrying them in a makeshift pouch . Khaleesi was brought to Taronga Wildlife Hospital after her mother was struck and killed by a car . The surrogate mother has been carrying Khaleesi in a makeshift pouch around her waist and breaking from her normal duties looking after Taronga’s big cats to bottle feed her four times a day with the help from her fellow keepers. 'All the carnivore keepers have just melted over her. They bring in native flowers, leaves and grass for her each day and she gets plenty of love and attention around the office,” she said. Ms Carr said Alkira and Khaleesi’s stories should serve as a reminder for motorists to watch out for wildlife on the roads this summer. ‘It’s also really important to stop and check those pouches, as it could mean saving a little life like Khaleesi’s,’ she said.

Surrogate mother Ms Carr has been hand-raising Khaleesi and carrying her in a makeshift pouch . In September, Alikira, whose name means ‘sunshine’ was brought to the Taronga Wildlife Hospital two weeks before Khaleesi, after her mother was killed by a car at Oxford Falls, north of Sydney. Matt Dea, co-ordinator for Taronga's Roar and Snore sleepover event has been hand-raising the female joey by carrying a makeshift pouch and waking up at 2am for one of five daily bottle feeds. 'Caring for such a young joey is very involved and she hasn't left my side,' Mr Dea said. 'She comes home with me, she comes to the shops and she sleeps beside my desk at work each day.'

He went on: 'I think he (Pulis) wants me to stay, yeah. If not I don’t know why! Maybe I did something wrong. 'I want to continue to work with him and with Crystal Palace. Everything, the atmosphere, the players I work with, I don’t want to change anything. 'I just want to be better and better with Crystal Palace.' Chamakh admits the Palace fans are the best he has come across, as he added: 'It's crazy. Sometimes when we play away I have travelled back by train with the fans. 'We were talking for like two hours and I can see how they love this team and this club. 'This has happened four or five times and it is just a moment when we can talk together.

"Dr Mansoor Kassim, who is facing being struck off after faking Viagra prescriptions worth £340 . A doctor is facing being struck after forging Viagra prescriptions to help him patch up his marriage because he was too embarrassed to ask his own GP. Dr Mansoor Kassim was having 'marital difficulties' when he faked the prescriptions worth £340.67 to the NHS. The 37-year-old, who worked at the Ystrad Fawr Hospital at Caerphilly, South Wales, has already been given a suspended jail sentence for faking the scripts. Now the doctor is facing a hearing by the General Medical Council who argue his fitness to practise is impaired by his conviction. Dr Kassim told the disciplinary panel that it was a 'stupid mistake' due to a 'stressful situation' within his marriage. He said: 'I have been very dishonest doing these things. I am not offering any excuse, I understand there is no excuse for this. 'I am remorseful and ashamed that it came to this. This was a unique case. It was a stressful situation in my life. It was a stupid mistake. 'I put my career at stake. I lost my family. I have learnt my lesson.' Presenting officer Sharon Beattie told the hearing Dr Kassim took the fake prescriptions for sildenafil - better known as Viagra - to a chemist to collect the tablets himself for over eight months. But staff were suspicious because he worked in a trauma and orthopaedic unit where patients would not normally need drugs for impotence. Staff then brought in handwriting experts who discovered the stolen prescription forms had been filled in by Dr Kassim. Miss Beattie told the GMC hearing Dr Kassim started forging prescriptions on the second day of his employment at Ystrad Fawr Hospital. Dr Kassim, who had a home in Ilford, Essex, visited pharmacies in Newport with his fake prescriptions to obtain 20 Viagra tablets at a time, which are free on prescription in Wales. He yesterday claimed it was a 'one off' mistake to fake the prescriptions but Miss Beattie said his pattern of offending went on for over eight months between February and October last year. Dr Kassim agreed but added: 'The reasons were a one-off. I have made a foolish decision. An error of judgement at this time. A GMC hearing heard that Dr Kassim started forging the prescriptions on the second day of his employment at Ystrad Fawr Hospital, pictured . 'The whole issue was I did not want to reveal my identity then and tell anyone I had these problems.' Dr Kassim has already been convicted of two counts of theft, four counts of forgery and three counts of fraud in relation to four prescriptions. He was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to pay compensation of £340.67, costs of £2561.11 and victim surcharge of £100. The hearing continues.

"Outspoken Australian senator Jacqui Lambie has been branded the 'Australian Sarah Palin' by an American radio host who said he is glad the US isn't the only country with colourful politicians. The David Packman Show poked fun at the Palmer United Party senator, who called her now infamous attempt to explain sharia law as tossing 'together such an epic word salad'. The host of the American radio show commented that the question should have been simple 'for some who is an anti-Muslim crusader,' but Ms Lambie delivered 'a brutal assault on the English language.' Scroll down for video . Outspoken Australian senator Jacqui Lambie has been branded the 'Australian Sarah Palin' by an American radio host who said he is glad the US isn't the only country with colourful politicians . The David Packman Show poked fun at the Palmer United Party senator, who called her now infamous attempt to explain sharia law as tossing 'together such an epic word salad' In the interview with  ABC's Insiders on Ms Lambie struggled to explain what she thought sharia law was when asked by the show's presenter Barrie Cassidy, while reiterating her tough stance against the moral code. 'If you are not going to show your allegiance to our law, then get out,' she said. But Ms Lambie was left tongue-tied when asked what she understood sharia to mean. 'Well I think...when it comes to...sharia law...you know to me...it obviously involves terrorism,' she told Mr Cassidy. 'It involves a power that is not a healthy power.' The show compared her to controversial Alaskan governor Sarah Palin, labeling the interview 'completely embarrassing'. 'I think Sarah Palin would be hard pressed to top that,' the host said. 'I'm sorry Australia has to deal with this...We wouldn't wish this upon anybody.' In the interview with ABC's Insiders on Ms Lambie struggled to explain what she thought sharia law was when asked by the show's presenter Barrie Cassidy . Ms Lambie was left tongue-tied when asked what she understood sharia to mean . The show ridiculed her proposal for a $3400 fine for wearing a 'Muslim head or face covering without a reasonable excuse', pointing out that she doesn't identify what a reasonable excuse would actually entail. The host drew attention to her belief that Muslims have plans to use ebola to launch a terrorist attack on Australian soil, noting that it would be slowest way to kill a nation. Lambie has been outspoken in her views on Islam and Sharia law, though she has had difficulty expressing her views clearly. 'It's not going to come as a shock when I tell you that I'm not an Islamic scholar,' Ms Lambie admitted. In an address to parliament, the Palmer United Party member said 'These thugs and extremists will not stop their acts of terrorism and depravity until their way of life, their culture and their law is imposed on Australia - indeed the whole world.' 'These maniacs and depraved humans will not stop committing their cold blooded butchery and rapes until every woman in Australia wears a burqa and is subservient to men,' Senator Lambie said. Ms Lambie also said 'every major terrorist attack in the western world' such as 911, the Bali Bombings, the Boston marathon bombings and 'recent beheadings and massacres' had been carried out by supporters of sharia law. Senator Lambie has previously suggested sending troops over to fight in Iraq and other parts of the Middle East, and suggested: 'We need to get rid of them (Islamic extremeists) and their associates on home soil' first. 'Clean up the rubbish in your own backyard before you try to clean up the rubbish in others', she added. The show compared her to controversial Alaskan governor Sarah Palin, labeling the interview 'completely embarrassing' 'It's not going to come as a shock when I tell you that I'm not an Islamic scholar,' Ms Lambie admitted . Clive Palmer has distanced himself from the outlandish comments, and told Fairfax Media: 'Party policy is determined by a meeting of the members and is announced by the leader'. This follows his tweets earlier in the day where he said Australian's need to 'remain united' as they have 'strong obligations towards each other'. In August, Ms Lambie made headlines again when she called for Australia to look into using missiles to defend the nation from other countries 'to stop our grandchildren from becoming slaves to an anti-democratic power' like China. She made the comments in support of Palmer, who days before had ranted about 'Chinese mongrels' and 'Chinese b***ards' on ABC's Q&A program. She refused to say 'sorry' to China, despite Mr Palmer penning an apology letter to the superpower. One Twitter user asked, 'Are we absolutely sure Jacqui Lambie isn't just a new Chris Lilley character?', echoing the comments from the David Packman show, who said 'It's fantastic...it's comforting to know that these types of people exist elsewhere, and that we're [the US] not the only ones who have to deal with it.","The David Packman Show labelled the outspoken Tasmanian senator 'the Australian Sarah Palin'

"Residents have discovered anti-Semitic flyers in their letterboxes which urge 'white Australia' to 'wake up'. The flyers distributed in the Sydney beach-side suburb of Bondi - known for its high number of Jewish residents - make reference to white power group Stormfront. The letters claim 'the Jews' encourage 'race mixing' and that they 'own' Hollywood and the majority of Western media. CEO of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies Vic Alhadeff told Daily Mail Australia he completely condemned the posters, which were signed off by a Sydney chapter of Stormfront, Squadron 88. 'The flyers are an appalling compilation of racist stereotypes, which is all too predicable from neo-Nazi organisations. It's no coincidence that 88 represents HH, which stands for Heil Hitler.' Scroll down for video . This flier was distributed around Bondi in Sydney, which has a high population of Jewish people . 'It's most concerning that such blatant hatred is alive and well in our country and its deeply disturbing that group which holds such views should feel that the climate in conducive for them to come out of the woodwork,' Mr Alhadeff said. CEO of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies Vic Alhadeff said such anti-Semitic incidents were on the rise . The flyers also claimed 'Jews have been kicked out of countries 109 times throughout history... Could it be that having them in a European country is harmful to the host?'. When asked if he had seen similar cases in the past, Mr Alhadeff said he had and although these groups were known for their position on such issues incidents were on the rise. 'There has however been a very concerning rise in anti-Semitic sentiments these past months. 'This has been evident in a large number of incidents ranging from swastikas on the streets of Sydney to the verbal assault of children on a school bus most recently', he said. Mr Alhadeff was referring to an incident that took place in Randwick at the start of this month where a group of teenagers boarded a bus full of Jewish school children and terrorised them. 'Such conduct violates the values of our country and what we stand for as a multicultural society which overwhelmingly respects diversity,' Mr Alhadeff continued. One Bondi resident who received the letter sent it to American Jewish newspaper Algemeiner and told them he was 'disgusted' by the discovery. 'It is part of an increase in anti-Semitism that such low people as the ones who issued these flyers feel comfortable coming out of the woodwork', Abraham Blasenstein said. 'It is not a pleasant thought that there are some people that would like to do the worst to you for no reason other than their cruel character. It was the smallest touch of what it must have felt like for Jews in Europe before WWII. 'There, there was no hope and no support, at least now in Australia it is reasonable to believe that most decent people will find this type of leaflet appalling,' Mr Blasenstein continued. Australian Race Discrimination Commissioner Dr Tim Soutphommasane tweeted that he was 'very disturbed' by the flyers . Australia Race Discrimination Commissioner Dr Tim Soutphommasane told Daily Mail Australia via a statement that extremely racist messages such as the flyer have no place in Australia and the Jewish community has his full support. 'We should be very concerned to see such anti-Semitic material being circulated in Sydney. It is a worrying sign that extremists are being emboldened to spread their messages of racial hatred. Stormfront is a website associated with neo-Nazi organisations and with the advocacy of racist doctrines. 'Ideas about racial hatred or purity simply have no place in Australian society. Those responsible for this material should be condemned.' The letter was signed off by Squadron 88 which is a Sydney offshoot of neo-Nazi group Stormfront, whose logo is pictured here . 'Members of the Australian Jewish community have communicated to me their concern about rising anti-Semitism. The Jewish community has my full support in combating prejudice and discrimination. There needs to be an unambiguous message from all levels of society about racism. 'Where there isn't, extremists can start to believe that they may have licence to express their racial hatred. We can’t be complacent. When it is given the opportunity, racial vilification can escalate to racial violence,' the statement finished. Also accusing Jewish people of pumping 'anti European values' and 'drug abuse', the flyer invited people 'with an open mind' to join them. On Squadron 88's Facebook page just over a week ago there was a call out for members who could help hand out leaflets around their suburb so long as the distributed a 'minimum of 500'. Federal MP for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull said on his website that those responsible for the leaflets were guilty of 'un-Australian behaviour'. 'These leaflets seek to undermine the security and the harmony of Australia and hence of all Australians,' he said.","Anti-Semitic flyers have been delivered to Bondi and Double Bay .

"A former governor's daughter has detailed her journey from being his secret love child to being welcomed into his family after launching a law suit against him to make him pay for her college fees. Kara Sundlun, a WFSB news anchor, is the daughter of Bruce Sundlun, the late former Rhode Island governor and wealthy businessman. In the mid-1970s, Sundlun had an affair with Kara's mother Judith Hewes while she was working as a flight attendant for an Ohio-based charter airline that he operated. Kara Sundlun (left) is the daughter of Bruce Sundlun,  (right) the late former Rhode Island governor and wealthy businessman. In the mid-1970s, Sundlun had an affair with Kara's mother Judith Hewes while she was working as a flight attendant for an Ohio-based charter airline that he operated . Kara was conceived in October 1974, three months into Sundlun's third marriage. She was raised by her mother and later took her mother's husband's name so was Kara Hewes for the first two decades of her life. Kara was conceived in October 1974, three months into Sundlun's third marriage . But in her later teen years she decided to make contact with her famous father who was a decorated World War II bomber pilot and made millions of dollars as a business magnate. 'He saw me as a baby once, but it wasn't until I was a teenager and saw him on television that I tried to reach out to him, to meet him,' she told Courant. 'I finally met him when I was 17 after my mom hired an attorney, and in 1992 I finally met him. 'The fact that my father was successful and all of that was great but it is not what I was looking for. 'I yearned for a figure of stability and inside, I needed to know who the other half of me was. Sundlun served two terms as governor from 1991 to 1995. It was in 1993, during his second term in office, Sundlun, then 73, was sued by Kara - the story made headlines across the country. Just before her 18th birthday, she filed a paternity suit against Sundlin, asserting that he was her biological father and therefore needed to pay her college tuition fees. The pair met and he reportedly said: 'She's 17, and I'm 73, but for three hours we got along pretty well, I thought.' But the governor said he was absolved of any legal responsibility because the girl had an adoptive father, People magazine reported at the time. In 2003 Sundlun walked Kara down the aisle for her marriage to WFSB anchor Dennis House in Newport (both pictured) Kara now has three half brothers who are his sons from his first marriage.

The magazine reported Kara said: 'My mother has supported me my whole life, so he should help out with my college education.' 'He should want to help his daughter get off on the right foot.' Eventually they reached an out of court settlement and under its terms, he acknowledged Kara as his daughter and agreed to pay her college tuition. Kara has now written a book detailing her experience . Speaking of their reconciliation Kara told Courant: 'He didn't ever say 'I'm sorry' in a maudlin way. 'Once I spent that first summer with him in Newport and we began to build a relationship, he would call several times a day. 'After I said ""I love you"" to him when we were finishing a phone call or saying goodbye, he started to say it. I remember I didn't care so much about things he could give me, but wanted a relationship he backed up with actions. She credits her relationship with her father for helping her pick her husband and following her career - she received counselling after a teenage suicide attempt. In 2003 Sundlun walked Kara down the aisle for her marriage to WFSB anchor Dennis House in Newport. 'At the wedding reception he made it right with my mom by giving her all the credit for raising me. It was definitely an acknowledgment of her. 'And the first time I celebrated a Father's Day with him and gave him a gift. That was a very special moment.' Kara and her husband now have two children and she says her father, who died in 2011, being 'concerned when I had my miscarriage, having him come to my daughter's first birthday' were key moments for her. His first four marriages - to Madeleine Schiffer Eisner, Pamela Soldwedel Barrett, Joyanne Carter and Marjorie Lee - ended in divorce.

"Ex News of the World news editor Ian Edmondson, 45, pictured at the Old Bailey today, admitted one charge of conspiring to intercept voicemails . A former News of the World news editor has been warned he may face jail after admitting plotting to hack phones in the pursuit of stories. Ian Edmondson, 45, was dropped as a defendant in the original hacking trial of ex-editors Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks in December last year after the trial judge discharged him on health grounds. But today Edmondson, of Raynes Park, south west London, admitted conspiring with colleagues and private detective Glenn Mulcaire to intercept the private voicemails of a host of celebrities, politicians, sports stars and royals between October 3 2000 and August 9, 2006. He admitted one charge of conspiring to intercept voicemails and will be charged next month, Mr Justice Saunders said. The judge remanded Edmondson on bail but warned him: 'not to read anything into that'. Among those targeted by the tabloid executive were senior government ministers John Prescott, Charles Clarke and David Blunkett, Hollywood stars Sienna Miller and Jude Law, and Beatles singer Sir Paul McCartney. During the original eight-month trial, jurors were told how Edmondson had worked as an executive on the newsdesk - the 'engine room of the newsroom' - since 2005. He was suspended in 2010 after three emails emerged implicating him in the hacking conspiracy, and he was sacked a year later when police saw emails sent between Edmondson and Mulcaire including clear instructions on hacking the phones of Tessa Jowell, Lord Freddie Windsor, and John Prescott's advisor, Joan Hammell. After he joined the now defunct News of the World, Edmondson had been keen to terminate Mulcaire's £100,000 a year contract, but in 2005 he signed off its renewal once he realised its value, the court heard. In all, he was responsible for nearly a quarter of the newsdesk orders to Mulcaire, according to an analysis of detailed notes kept by the private eye. Police found more than 8,000 tasking notes at Mulcaire's home, many of which did not identify who had instructed him. However, 334 of them had 'an"" written in the top left-hand corner, identifying Edmondson as the tasker, starting from February 2005. Former NotW royal editor Clive Goodman told the trial of Coulson and Brooks earlier this year that Edmondson and Coulson openly discussed phone hacking at the paper's daily news conference. He said Edmondson had once boasted, during the hunt for Lotto rapist Iorworth Hoare, that 'his man could triangulate position from mobile phone signals.' 'It was fairly obvious to me that he was using mobile phone data to find out things,' he said. Scroll down for video . NotW editor Andy Coulson, 46, was found guilty of phone hacking while Rebekah Brooks, 46, right, was cleared . Old Bailey: The journalist from Raynes Park, south west London, admitted conspiring to intercept voicemails . Edmondson admitted conspiring with private detective Glenn Mulcaire, 44, left, to intercept voicemails - former NotW royal editor Clive Goodman, right, told an earlier trial that Edmondson openly discussed phone hacking . Goodman also told the trial that Edmondson resorted to hacking the phones of his colleagues, so he knew which stories they were working on, and that of his boss, Coulson, each morning. In 2006, Coulson sent Edmondson an incriminating email ordering him to 'do his phone', in an apparent reference to the celebrity Calum Best. The court was told that there was a culture of secrecy and competition in the Sunday tabloid newsroom under Coulson. Defending, Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC said: 'Mr Edmondson was aware of phone hacking that was industry-wide and common knowledge. 'Mulcaire had bragged on many occasions in the past of his ability to hack phones and obtain information through that methodology.' She told the court that her client was working 'under the direct instruction from senior executives to use Mulcaire'. But Mr Justice Saunders warned him that he could face jail despite admitting his part in the conspiracy. Adjourning the sentencing for reports, he remanded the married journalist on conditional bail but repeatedly cautioned him 'not to read anything into that'. Former NotW staff Greg Miskwi, left, and Dan Evans both admitted being part of the phone hacking conspiracy . News editor James Weatherup, 58, was given a four-month suspended sentence for his part in the hacking . Reporter Neville Thurlbeck, 52, was jailed for six months while ex managing editor Stuart Kuttner was cleared . Today, prosecutors announced they would take no further action against News International's former legal chief Tom Crone, who was arrested two years ago over phone-hacking and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, saying there was insufficient evidence to secure a conviction. In a statement, his lawyer Henri Brandman said: 'My client, Tom Crone, the former Legal Manager of News International, was arrested two years ago in respect of various allegations including conspiracy to intercept communications and perverting the course of justice. 'He is delighted to have received news today that there will be no further action relating to the allegations. 'Given the lack of evidence to support those allegations, he is also surprised that it has taken the relevant authorities two years and one month to reach this decision.' In July, Coulson, 46, was found guilty of the hacking plot while Brooks, 46, and retired managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 74, were cleared of any wrongdoing. Other NotW journalists had pleaded guilty to being part of the voicemail interception conspiracy before the trial started. Reporter Dan Evans, 38, of Kilburn, north London, was handed a 10-month jail term suspended for 12 months plus 200 hours of community service. News of the World news editor Greg Miskiw, 64, from Leeds, and chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, 52, of Esher, Surrey, were each jailed for six months.

Mr Justice Saunders described Mulcaire, 44, of Sutton, south London, as 'the lucky one', saying it would be wrong to jail him again after he had already served a sentence in 2006 when he was first convicted of phone hacking with ex-royal editor Clive Goodman. The judge sentenced Mulcaire to six months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, plus 200 hours unpaid community work.","Ex news editor Ian Edmondson, 45, admitted hacking charge at Old Bailey .

"His character has been in self-imposed exile ever since he shamelessly ditched his fiancée at the altar during a memorable episode of The Archers. But now Tom Graham has found himself being dropped by the Radio 4 drama for good, after almost two decades on the soap. It is a move that has caused distress among the actor’s fans. Booted out: Tom Graham, 34, has announced that he has been dropped from Radio 4's The Archers, after 17 years of playing Tom Archer . And yesterday, after 17 years of providing the voice for meat products entrepreneur Tom Archer, Mr Graham, 34, revealed he would not be returning to Ambridge. Claiming he was being ‘deposed’ by the series, just weeks after the programme’s editor admitted some of the younger cast members were to be replaced by more experienced actors, Mr Graham wrote: ‘It is with much sadness that I must announce that after 17 years of playing Tom Archers, the show’s editor has taken the decision to re-cast the part. My reign as the sausage King of Ambridge has come to an end and I am being deposed. ‘I have loved every minute of playing Tom Archer and have grown up alongside him since joining the programme in 1997.’ Graham’s character, who is known for making often disastrous decisions, had been in self-imposed exile ever since he ended his relationship with Kirsty at the altar earlier this year. The would-be bride arrived at the church only to be told by her fiancé it was over. Long run: Tom Graham pictured in 1999, two tears after he joined The Archers . And Tom was so ashamed of himself that he left the fictional town of Ambridge, where The Archers is set, and moved to Canada where he got a job running a pig unit. Mr Graham continued: ‘It is a great loss to me not to be able to continue giving a voice to Tom’s journey when he returns to Ambridge from exile in Canada.’ He added: ‘I would like to thank all Archers fans for their support over the past 17 years. Chatting to listeners, whether they were championing Tom’s early eco-warrior antics, consoling him on the death of John, telling him he wasn’t treating Kirsty well enough, or rolling their eyes at his incessant ready-meal monologues, was undoubtedly the biggest joy of being part of the world’s longest running soap. ‘And so it is with a heavy heart that I bid farewell to my time as Tom Archer. So long, and thanks for all the sausages.’ Yesterday fans of Mr Graham, who has also appeared in TV shows Casualty and Grange Hill, sent messages of support to the actor and, despite his character’s unpopularity following his behaviour at the altar, spoke of their sadness he would be leaving. One wrote: I’m so sorry to hear that. Not happy with that decision at all,’ while another Tweeted: ‘Oh no. More sabotage of the The Archers by halfwit wannabe-cool BBC eds/prods….’ Others demanded to know why Mr Graham was being replaced, with one asking: Why? What the hell for? If you still wanted to play him, you were him. Why change? You fitted the part perfectly. It’s mad.’ However last night a spokesman for The Archers refused to expand on the decision, stating only: ‘Characters are frequently recast in The Archers and have been since the 1950s. We never comment on future storylines.’","Tom Graham leaving The Archers after 17 years as Tom Archer .

"According to court documents,  Adrian Peterson may have admitted to smoking marijuana. The disgraced football star has been forced to undergo drug testing as a condition of his bond in his child abuse case in Texas, and he reportedly informed an employee at the facility during a recent visit that he might not be clean. He allegedly told the employee that he had recently 'smoke a little weed.' Scroll down for video . Hot water: Adrian Peterson (above) could be going to jail for allegedly admitting he 'smoked a little weed' Poor choice: The Minnesota Vikings running back allegedly made this admission to an employee while undergoing his court-mandated drug test . Now, prosecutors are gunning to throw the Minnesota Vikings running back in jail. TMZ reports, 'prosecutors say that is a direct violation of the terms of his bond -- and have asked the court to order he be arrested.' It is uncertain if Peterson would have to fail the test for the prosecutors to follow through on this, or if the admission alone is enough. The judge is not expected to rule on this matter until next week. In other news, Peterson was in a Texas courtroom for the first time since being indicted on a felony child abuse charge last month just yesterday. More troubles: Peterson (above with one of his sons) was in court yesterday to try and get an early hearing date on his upcoming felony child abuse case . Some good news: Peterson (seen yesterday with wife Ashley Brown) secured an early hearing, but this new development could land him in jail regardless . With his wife Ashley Brown by his side, Peterson's lawyer was able to convince the judge to allow his client an early court date for his upcoming case. Peterson was hoping this would possibly allow him to get back on the field for the Vikings this season, but should he be arrested for smoking, that could be in jeopardy. Making matters worse, is how the NFL might respond to this news. Cleveland Browns player Josh Gordon was suspended for a year after testing positive for smoking marijuana earlier this year, just before the season began. Peterson has yet to comment on these recent claims.","Adrian Peterson had been ordered to undergo drug testing by the Texas court after being charged with felony child abuse last month .

"For people who suffer from serious disabilities like Parkinson’s or motor neurone disease, communication can be incredibly difficult. But a 16-year-old-has designed a device that could provide a promising solution, as it lets people communicate using just their breath. Called Talk, the device works by recognising shorts bursts of air as Morse code and turning the words and sentences into speech, enabling the severely paralysed to communicate with others. Scroll down for video . Indian Arsh Shah Dilbaghi has unveiled a device that converts nose breaths into speech (shown). The innovative project is an entry in Google's 2014 Science Fair. It works using a tube to measure two lengths of breaths - dots and dashes - in Morse code . Talk, from Indian Arsh Shah Dilbaghi, is one of 15 finalists in Google’s Global Science Fair project, reports Business Insider. He says that 1.4 per cent of the world’s population suffer from disorders that make regular communication all but impossible. In addition he says current devices are expensive and bulky, and do not offer a suitable alternative to regular speech. His idea was to make a gadget that was affordable, faster, portable and generic. What is the Google Science Fair? The Google Science Fair is a global online science and technology competition for individuals and teams aged 13 to 18. Participants must formulate a hypothesis, perform an experiment and then present their results. Dilbagi is one of 15 teenagers in the 2014 Google Science Fair finals. The winning project will receive a 10-day tip to the Galapagos Islands, £30,000 ($50,000) in scholarship funding and a visit to Virgin Galactic’s Spaceport in the Mojave Desert. It works by recognising two distinguishing exhales from a person in Morse code - a short burst and a slightly longer one. This mimics the action of dots and dashes in Morse code. The breaths are recorded by a tube that attaches under a person’s nose and into an external device. Inside the device the bursts of air are converted into words and sentences, and then read aloud by one of nine synthesised voices. Talk also has a second mode, which lets the user speak in specific commands or phases. ‘I got predicted results by testing the device with a person suffering from SEM [a disease of the brain] and Parkinson's disease,’ Dilbaghi writes in his proposal. ‘In future I would like to add auto-predictions to my Computing-Engine and integrate Talk with modern technology like Google Glass to make the world a better place to live [for] people with developmental disabilities.’ The winning project in Google's Science Fair will receive a 10-day tip to the Galapagos Islands, £30,000 ($50,000) in scholarship funding and a visit to Virgin Galactic’s Spaceport in the Mojave Desert. The Morse code breaths are sent to a synthesiser and spoken aloud by one of nine voices. A second mode lets the user speak in commands or phrases. Dilbaghi says the device could be used by sufferers of Parkinson's, ALS (such as Professor Hawking, shown above in 2008) and other conditions to more easily communicate .","Indian Arsh Shah Dilbaghi has unveiled a device that converts nose breaths into speech .

Pippa has been in talks with the 'peacock network' for a new job after she was interview by Matt Lauer this summer, People confirmed today. NBC News previously denied that a deal was in the works but the network has reportedly been in serious talks with Pippa for months about becoming a lifestyle and health correspondent. Excited locals in Jackson Hole, posted pictures all over social media of Miss Middleton this week, dressed in boots, skinny jeans and wearing a checked shirt. Pippa performed a routine which involved some twirling and sashaying with an elderly gent in a cowboy hat before going on to have a drink at the bar. Emily hash-tagged one video clip with 'pippamiddleton' before saying that she had told the 31-year-old she was happy she visited, and received a gracious smile as a reply.

She has apparently been in talks for months with NBC to come on board as a lifestyle and health correspondent . The freelance columnist dressed down for the flight in a padded jacket, skinny black jeans and ankle boots . Pippa first piqued NBC's interest in June when her interview, where she chatted over tea about her sister and Prince George, brought in high ratings for the network. It is expected that Ms Middleton, a former party planner and cookbook author who has been writing occasional columns about sports and lifestyle, will continue to focus on these subjects in her new role. NBC has declined to comment when approached by MailOnline. It is highly unlikely that Prince William's sister-in-law would report on the Royal Family as the subject is deemed off-limits. She is not the first with Royal connections to cash in as Charles Spencer, the brother of the late Princess Diana, also had a gig at NBC in the 1980s. The Queen's youngest son, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, also dabbled in TV in the 1990s, forming the production company, Ardent, in 1993. The company made a number of documentaries and dramas but was voluntarily liquidated in June 2009, with total assets amounting to $65.

In 2012, it was reported that NBC would offer Pippa $600,000 to be a royal correspondent but this was denied by the network. During her interview with Matt Lauer in June, which marked Pippa's first-ever TV appearance, the glamorous socialite shed light on her relationship with her sister, who is a member of the British Royal Family through her marriage to Prince William. Pippa seems set to join 'peacock' network NBC following months of secret talks over the deal . Asked about her relationship with Kate, Pippa said she and her sister are still very close and enjoy doing 'sisterly things'. Miss Middleton famously stole the spotlight during the Royal Wedding in 2011 when she donned a curve-hugging white bridesmaid’s gown for the ceremony. Pippa's media career has suffered a few minor setbacks this past year. Her party-planning book, Celebrate, suffered disappointing sales, and in May it was announced that Middleton had been dropped as a columnist for The Daily Telegraph after just six months. She still writes for Vanity Fair and is associated with the supermarket Waitrose. Pippa is currently dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, 36, who in July took a new job at a hedge fund in Switzerland. However according earlier reports, the couple's relationship has gone stale, Nico told friends. Pippa was recently spotted enjoying lunch with millionaire hotel tycoon Andre Balazs at his A-list haunt the Chiltern Firehouse in Central London. Balazs, who is now reportedly dating pop starlet Kylie Minogue, is known for his web of celebrity connections and owns several U.S. hotels including the Chateau Marmont in LA and New York's The Standard.

"A Sunderland FC supporter could just be the unluckiest fan in Britain after watching his side get thrashed 8-0 at the weekend  - for the third time since 1968. Cass Farrar, 69, was devastated after the Black Cats were crushed by Southampton in the Premiership on Saturday, marking an unhappy hat-trick for the father-of-three. The retired headteacher has witnessed all three of his team's huge 8-0 losses since the club's first 46 years ago. Cass Farrar, 69, was devastated after the Black Cats were crushed by Southampton in the Premiership by  8-0 at the weekend - for the third time since 1968 . Mr Farrar first saw the team humiliated by the same score during an away game at West Ham's Upton Park, on October 19, 1968. He is a member of London's branch of the Sunderland Supporters' Association and had been living in the capital for two years when he saw Geoff Hurst rack up six goals, while fellow World Cup winner Bobby Moore, and Trevor Brooking took it up to eight. The second 8-0 defeat came at Watford on September 25, 1982, which he also attended to witness Luther Blissett put four past the Wearsiders' goal, with Ross Jenkins and Nigel Callaghan scoring two each. But despite his bad luck Mr Farrar, now of Greenwich, London, is sticking by his team. He said: 'It was abysmal. The floodgates were opened so easily. 'Some people say ""I'm never going again"" but I've already got my ticket for Crystal Palace. I'll be going.' Mr Farrar saw the team humiliated first by the same score during an away game at West Ham's Upton Park, on October 19, 1968 (left) Speaking about the latest game, he said: 'Vergini, well I sort of blinked and he put it in the Sunderland goal after 10 minutes. I thought 'What was that all about?' 'Mannone didn't have the best of games so he's probably to blame for two or three goals and then Bridcutt ran in. 'Southampton were so slick and I think we made them look good. 'I like Lee Cattermole and it looked like he'd given up and some of the others as well, but it was a shock.'

Summer signing Dusan Tadic jumps into the arms of Italian forward Pelle after scoring his side's sixth goal . Former Celtic man Victor Wanyama celebrates scoring Southampton's seventh of the afternoon . He said one of his most vivid memories of the West Ham game include the goalscoring headers by England hero Hurst. And at Watford, he was haunted by a screen which beamed out an image of three yellow footballers dancing to celebrate a home score. 'It was set off eight times that day, so it was like it was up there all the time,' he said. Cass, is married to school teacher Bethan, 67, and dad to Lucy, 33, Sarah, 31, and James, 27 - an actor who played Liam Gilmore in Hollyoaks, also a Sunderland fan. Cass is helped in his bid to get tickets by Peter Robinson, who was in the year above him at Ryhope Grammar School, taking in about 20 games a season. He attended Saturday's match with Barry Emmerson, from Whitburn, and a classmate, and Barry's son Martin, a cricket commentator for BBC Newcastle.","Cass Farrar, 69, watched the Black Cats get crushed by Southampton .

"A Spanish nurse who treated an Ebola victim in Madrid has become the first person in the world to contract the deadly virus outside of Africa. The 44-year-old is said to have spent the last 15 years working at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital, where the two Spanish missionaries infected with Ebola died. The woman, who is married, was part of the team that treated Spanish priest Manuel Garcia Viejo, who was brought back from Africa last month so that he could be treated for the deadly virus. Scroll down for video . The Spanish nurse has become the first person in the world to contract Ebola outside of Africa after treating a patient with the deadly virus at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital. Pictured: Police escort an ambulance with the nurse . The medical workers donned full protective clothing as they transported the nurse between Spanish hospitals . The 44-year-old Spanish woman was moved between the hospitals in a special fully-incubated stretcher . Medical staff could be seen removing the woman on an enclosed stretcher out of the ambulance last night . The woman has moved from Alcorcon Hospital to Madrid's Carlos III Hospital by those in full protective suits . A medical worker in protective gear stands next to a special stretcher carrying the infected Spanish nurse . Two separate tests confirmed that the woman, who has yet to be named, had contracted the disease. Colleagues tonight expressed their surprise at news that the nurse, from Galicia in northwest Spain, had caught the virus, saying that there had been 'extreme' measures in place to protect staff. One told Spanish daily El Pais that nurses were equipped with two protective overalls, two pairs of gloves and glasses. All medics had to use a special card to access the hospital's sixth floor - where the two men were treated. The Carlos III Hospital was evacuated before the arrival of the first missionary, Miguel Pajares, who contracted the disease in Liberia, but not for Mr Viejo as the sixth floor had already been hermetically sealed. Mr Pajares, the first person in Europe to be treated for Ebola, died at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital in August despite receiving experimental drug ZMapp after he returned. The Spanish nurse was part of the team that treated Spanish priest Manuel Garcia Viejo, who was brought back from Africa last month so that he could be treated for the deadly virus pictured. He died on September 26 . Mr Viejo was a member of the Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios who worked in the Western city of Lunsar . Mr Viejo died at the hospital the following month after contracting the virus in Sierra Leone. Ebola spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of someone who has the virus and the only way to stop an outbreak is to isolate those who are infected. The current outbreak in west Africa, the worst ever, has infected nearly 7,500 people and caused more than 3,400 deaths. The Spanish nurse is understood to have tested positive for Ebola in a first analysis after going to hospital in Alcorcon near Madrid with a high fever early this morning. Doctors isolated the emergency treatment room. A Ministry of Health source told respected daily El Mundo: 'She arrived at the University Hospital Alcorcon Foundation with fever and has undergone tests. The first test has come back positive.' Spain's Health Ministry today held a crisis meeting as they awaited for the results to be confirmed. British nurse William Pooley, 29, who was infected with the virus while working in Sierra Leone, recovered last month after being flown back to London for treatment. He later jetted to the US to give blood to an American battling the disease. Thomas Duncan, the first person diagnosed in the west with the disease, contracted Ebola last month in Liberia and is now 'fighting for his life' at a hospital in Dallas after flying to the US to visit his fiancee. Spanish nurse, Manuel Garcia Viejo, is pictured being flown home from Sierra Leone in a plastic isolation chamber. It is understood that the female Spanish nurse was part of the team that treated him . The researchers at Northeastern University, in Boston, calculated the countries most at risk in the short term, are: . Leading charity Save the Children warned recently Ebola is spreading at a 'terrifying rate' with the number of recorded cases doubling every week. Speaking at a conference in London co-hosted with Sierra Leone last week, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond called for more financial aid, doctors and nurses. Scientists have warned that the deadly virus could spread across the world infecting people from the U.S. to China within three weeks. There is a 50 per cent chance a traveller carrying the disease could touch down in the UK by October 24, a team of U.S. researchers have predicted. Using Ebola spread patterns and airline traffic data they have calculated the odds of the virus spreading across the world. They estimate there is a 75 per cent chance Ebola will reach French shores by October 24. And Belgium has a 40 per cent chance of seeing the disease arrive on its territory, while Spain and Switzerland have lower risks of 14 per cent each. A team of scientists at Northeastern University in Boston have used air travel information to predict where the deadly Ebola virus could reach in the next three weeks . Professor Alessandro Vespignani of Northeastern University in Boston, who led the research, said: 'This is not a deterministic list, it's about probabilities – but those probabilities are growing for everyone. 'It's just a matter of who gets lucky and who gets unlucky. 'Air traffic is the driver. 'But there are also differences in connections with the affected countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), as well as different numbers of cases in these three countries - so depending on that, the probability numbers change.'","Unnamed nurse believed to be part of team that treated Manuel Garcia Viejo .

"They must spend their days locked up behind bars, living shoulder to shoulder with murderers, rapists and drug dealers, yet they have committed no crimes. Meet the desperate mothers, children and babies who have been forced to move into a bleak Filipino prison alongside their incarcerated relatives after being left homeless by Typhoon Yolanda. Over five million people saw their homes destroyed when the typhoon hit nine regions in the central Philippines on November 8, 2013, leaving behind a wide swath of destruction. The  category five storm brought winds of up to 235 miles per hour causing massive landslides and flooding. In all some 14 million people were affected, with over 6,000 people losing their lives. Desperate times: One of the many Filipino families forced to live in prison with their incarcerated relatives after they were left homeless by Typhoon Yolanda . New York-based photographer Lawrence Sumulong visited Leyte Provincial Jail in the Philippines earlier this year to document the unusual situation where large numbers of displaced families have been forced to move in with their incarcerated relatives. At  Leyte he was surprised to find women and children walk freely among inmates. While most of the inmates claim to be serving time for petty crimes such as theft or drug trafficking, their photo releases reveal many more are actually serving time for more serious crimes. He said: 'My assignment was to verify whether families of the inmates were continuing to live inside the destroyed jail, which was a story that journalist, Aya Lowe had originally broken. 'Leading up to my trip, there was news that access to the jail was restricted and the families had long since relocated.' 'The backdrop of a prison as a site for family portraits also presented a surreal and existential take on what could be a fairly straight ahead reportage story. 'From my distant vantage point in New York City, the disaster as it unfolded had become an abstraction in my mind. I didn't care to see the work of non-Filipino journalists representing a tragedy in the Philippines. I wanted to view, process, and relay the experience in my own way.' Difficult childhood: Over five million people were left homeless after the typhoon hit nine regions in the central Philippines on November 8, 201 . At Leyte Provincial Jail in the Philippines women and children walk freely among inmates, many of whom are serving long sentences for serious crimes such as rape and murder . Last refuge: Around five million people were made homeless after Typhoon Yolanda tore across the Philippines in November last year . Family ties: A father is pictured with his young daughter at Leyte Provincial Jail. In all some 14 million people were affected by the typhoon, with over 6,000 people losing their lives . Bleak: An inmate's family cell at Leyte prison. The backdrop of a prison as a site for family portraits  presented a surreal and existential opportunity for photographer Lawrence Sumulong . Roll call: Prisoners assemble on the grounds of Leyte Provincial jail in the Philippines . Much to his surprise all of the families had continued to live alongside the inmates and wardens. He decided to take the portraits in various corners of the prison. 'The portraits that I am presenting represent a small sampling of the many families that I photographed. I didn't have the insight into what the jail had originally looked like. 'But these newly reconstructed spaces seemed familiar and reminiscent of some of the homes that informal settlers or squatters would often build in various parts of the Philippines.' He says that the presence of family members made it difficult to ascertain and comprehend the crimes that the inmates had been accused of. 'I was told that petty crimes such as robbery and drug trafficking were the main culprits. However, upon looking at the makeshift release forms that I had asked each family and inmate to sign, murder and rape were the most prevalent.' A working society has sprung up inside the prison, with its own water sanitation, security, and even fruit stands. 'Most report that as dangerous as bringing their families to such a situation is, life on the outside is still worse as the country continues its slow recovery.' Many inmates inside worry that they may never be able to leave with their families when the outside infrastructure recovers. 'Visually, I was inspired by Chien Chi Chang's uncanny book, The Chain. Although my images don't hold a candle to that series, it helped organise how I thought of shooting that situation.' Squalor: Photographer Lawrence Sumulong captured a series of moving family portraits using the grim surroundings of the prison as a backdrop .

Though the prison is desolate, it is still equipped with electricity, water purification, security and a sick ward, which is much more than you would find outside of its gates . An inmate's family cell which also serves as a jail shop is seen in one of New York-based photographer Lawrence Sumulong's poignant images . Though the prison is desolate, it is still equipped with electricity, water purification, security and a sick ward, which is much more than you would find outside of its gates. Unfortunately, those staying in the prison are still subject to disciplinary measures. 'In one family portrait, a boy holds a light bulb upside down. As a trope in and out of context, that to me says something about the overall situation.' Mr Sumulong found the atmosphere in the prison was somewhat relaxed, which he found rather disquieting. He believes that there is a cliché in the media about the resilience of the Filipino people and spirit. 'I am not comforted by that statement or the appearance that life seemingly goes on. 'I am currently contending with what it means to leave that moment and place behind. Most concretely, the loss of records leaves the judicial process crippled and both the inmates and their families are lost in a type of purgatory or limbo as to what the future holds.' 'It is remote, obscure to the media, and impoverished to the extent that improvisation and adaptation emerge in surreal and absurd ways, for example re-purposing a prison as a gated community. 'At this point, it feels unnecessary for me to simply return as a photographer unless I can enact a change or help someone.' The Yolanda typhoon devastated the country's court system, washing away a large amount of court records forever.

One man Mr Sumulong met said due to the loss of court records due to the Typhoon Haiyan, he feared that the judicial process has been completely crippled and the future of all of the inmates and the livelihoods of their families' lies lost in limbo. Even before the disaster, this particular inmate had been residing at Leyte Provincial Jail for over 10 years awaiting a trial. The photographer feels that his project Raising a Family Behind Bars, he has used the fate of the Leyte Provincial Jail to create a metaphor or a microcosm depicting the humanitarian crisis in the Philippines.","Over five million people left homeless after  Typhoon Yolanda struck the Philippines in November last year .

"A massive increase in antibiotic prescriptions is being fuelled by out-of-hours GPs – with potentially fatal consequences, experts claim. The number handed out by doctors covering nights and weekends has increased by up to a third since 2010. Health experts say locums filling these shifts – as well as dentists and walk-in centres – do not know patients and are more inclined to hand out antibiotics as a quick fix. Number of antibiotics prescribed by doctors on nights and weekends has increased by up to a third since 2010 . Overall, the number of antibiotics prescribed by GPs, hospitals, dentists and out of hours clinics has risen by 6 per cent in four years. This is despite repeated attempts by the NHS to bring the figure down over fears that over-prescribing is creating strains of drug-resistant bacteria, making many illnesses effectively untreatable – including potentially deadly ones. Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies has warned that the threat is 'as big as terrorism' and could lead to minor scratches becoming fatal. It has been caused by over-prescribing antibiotics – meant for bacterial illnesses, even for coughs and colds, which are caused by viruses and are unaffected by the drugs. Scientists have warned that E. coli, a frequent cause of infection, is becoming resistant to antibiotics . Bacteria have gradually become more resistant and a growing number cannot be eradicated by common treatments. In the first study of its kind, Public Health England looked at prescriptions for antibiotics in hospitals, GP surgeries, out-of-hours clinics and dentists. Since 2010, the numbers have risen by 6 per cent, from 25.9 doses per day for every 1,000 people to 27.4 doses. This is 28 per cent higher than the European average of 21.3 doses per 1,000 people. Previously, GPs have been blamed for handing out drugs too freely under pressure from demanding patients who expect to be given some sort of medication. But this report shows the number given by family doctors fell last year by 3.5 per cent to 21.5 doses per day. Those from out-of-hours doctors, walk-in centres and dentists has risen by 32 per cent since 2010. Dr Susan Hopkins, the epidemiologist behind the report, said: 'GPs know patients and they're able to give a back-up prescription so they don't immediately go and fill it – they only take it if they get worse over the next few days. 'It's a really good measure of reducing prescribing. Urgent-care centres don't know that patient.' Her study is the first to look at the issue across the NHS. It also found that the number of prescriptions handed out in hospitals had increased by 12 per cent. Professor John Watson, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said: 'Anti-microbial resistance is one of the biggest threats to health security facing the world today.'","Prescriptions for antibiotics have risen by 6 per cent in four years .

"The bill for the British police investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is set to top £10million. Madeleine went missing aged three while on holiday with her parents in Portugal in 2007 and has never been found. David Cameron ordered a review of the case in 2011, which has seen Metropolitan Police detectives travel to Portugal to investigate. Scroll down for video . Scotland Yard officers (pictured, right) have been travelling to Portugal as part of a review of the evidence in the case of Madeleine McCann (left) The bill for the new inquiry - which has involved large-scale searches of Portuguese resort Praia da Luz (pictured) - will soon top £10million, figures have revealed . As part of the new investigation, police carried out digs and used sniffer dogs in an area of scrubland not far from where the youngster disappeared in 2007 . It emerged today that the cost of the review will soon be more than £10million - around the twice the £5million originally set aside. A freedom of information request by the Daily Mirror found that police spent £1.9million in the first year of the review, £2.8million in the second year and £2.6million in the third. With the bill for this year expected to be roughly the same as last year, the overall cost will rise from £7.3million to more than £10million, it was reported. A Home Office spokesman said: 'The Home Office remains committed to supporting the search for Madeleine McCann. 'We have always said we would provide the Metropolitan Police with the resources they need to investigate her disappearance.' The cost of the investigation emerged after a new Portuguese prosecutor, Ines Sequeira, was brought in and given the job of solving the disappearance. A source close to investigation said: '[Ms Sequeira] has been appointed as the new prosecutor and the Scotland Yard team has been given renewed hope of being able to start work again in Portugal before the end of the month. The initial estimated for the Home Office-funded enquiry - called Operation Grange - was around £5million . Police hope the new inquiry will provide answers for Madeleine's devastated parents - Kate and Gerry McCann (pictured on the anniversary of their daughter's disappearance) Madeleine went missing from the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz (pictured) in 2007, prompting a huge hunt . 'Ms Sequeira is one of the sharpest and most ambitious prosecutors in Portugal. She is utterly determined to get a result on the Madeleine inquiry.' Scotland Yard officers are due to fly to Portugal later this month to re-interview three of seven suspects previously questioned in Faro police stations. Among them are Jose Carlos Fernandes da Silva, an ex-worker at the Ocean Club resort, Paulo Ribeiro, who looks like a man seen near the apartment, and charity collector Ricardo Rodrigues. Madeleine McCann vanished from the room she was sharing with her younger twin siblings while her parents were eating dinner in a restaurant in the resort of Praia da Luz in May 2007. Several men, including a Cape Verde immigrant and heroin addict who died in 2009 following a tractor incident, have been considered as suspects but no one has been charged over the child's disappearance. May 3, 2007 - Madeline disappeared from the seaside Ocean Club resort in Praia de Luz, Portugal. The police began the hunt for Madeleine on the following day. May 30, 2007 - Mr and Mrs McCann met the Pope in Rome in the first of a series of trips around Europe and beyond to highlight the search for their daughter. January 2009 - The fund set up by the McCanns to help find Madelaine announced that £2million in donations had been sent in. May 2011 - Mrs McCann published a book about her daughter's disappearance on Madeleine's eighth birthday and Scotland Yard launched a review of the case after a request from Home Secretary Theresa May, supported by Prime Minister David Cameron. April 2012 - Scotland Yard detectives said they believe Madeleine could still be alive and released an age-progression picture of how she might look now as a nine-year-old. They called on the Portuguese authorities to reopen the case. In 2012, Scotland Yard released an age-progression picture of how they believed Madeleine may look . April 2013 - London's chief crown prosecutor Alison Saunders and her deputy Jenny Hopkins flew to Portugal with Scotland Yard detectives to discuss the case with their Portuguese counterparts. July 2013 - Scotland Yard said it had 'genuinely new' lines of inquiry and had identified 38 people of interest, including 12 Britons. October 2013 - Portugal's Attorney General announced that the case was being officially reopened. March 2014 - British police investigating the disappearance said they were looking for a prolific paedophile who sexually abused five girls at holiday homes in the Algarve before the British toddler went missing. June 2014 - British Detectives searched scrubland in the holiday resort using radar equipment and sniffer dogs.","Metropolitan police probe set up in 2011 to review evidence in the case .

"City girl: Billie Piper in London earlier this week . She put her wild child past behind her and settled down to a quiet family life in the country. But seven years later, it seems Billie Piper has finally tired of her rural idyll and is moving back to the bright city lights. The 32-year-old actress and her actor husband Laurence Fox, 36, have put their secluded Sussex cottage up for sale and bought a smart townhouse in north London. Miss Piper – who shot to fame playing the companion in Doctor Who and a prostitute in the TV drama Secret Diary of a Call Girl – has been flooded with work after struggling to find roles for several years. She is currently in stage farce Great Britain at London’s National Theatre and recently played a poor Irish immigrant in Sky Atlantic drama Penny Dreadful. Meanwhile Mr Fox – who is best known for starring in ITV detective drama Lewis – is busy recording a music album and made his own West End appearance in Strangers on a Train at the Gielgud theatre. It seems the young couple, who are parents to two sons Winston, five, and Eugene, two, no longer have time to relax in the countryside. When they married in 2007, they settled down in a picturesque, oak-timbered cottage near Midhurst, West Sussex, which they bought for £725,000. They soon learned to appreciate its views of rolling fields, large garden and friendly village pub, and bought a horse called Chutney, two pics named Boris and Barack and three chickens. Mr Fox seemed to appreciate the rustic simplicity even more than his wife. In 2011, he said he loved their ‘boringly normal’ life, adding: ‘I never liked London. I always said I wanted to live in the country. I’m an outdoorsy sort of person; I go fishing, take my dog out to the pub.’ But it seems Miss Piper, who often says she is less laid back than her husband, began to tire of the good life, especially when he had to spend time in Los Angeles looking for acting work. She told an interviewer she began to feel bored in the countryside after the birth of their first son. She said: ‘I did go a bit Sylvia Plath down there. Staring at the condensation on the window and wondering where it comes from. For sale: Piper is getting rid of her country house in West Sussex and moving back to London . ‘Following slugs in the garden that hadn’t moved a foot, and feeling a bit desperate. Laurence was filming when I first had Winston. I’d had an emergency caesarean and I could barely walk. I was alone in the country with a new born baby for three weeks.’ And it seems couple’s elderly neighbours did not immediately warm to the actress thanks to her racy reputation and role in ITV’s Secret Diary of a Call Girl. In 2010, she revealed: ‘A few of the older locals actually believe I’m a whore. They love Laurence because he’s in Lewis — his fan club are in their mid-60s upwards. ‘It’s sickening. They look at me and they are like, “That s***! How could you dirty yourself with her? She’s corrupted you”.’ Girl about town: piper starring asescort Belle in ITV's London-based Secret Diary of a Call Girl . Sci-fi: Piper playing Doctor Who's companion Rose, with John Hurt as the Doctor in the BBC hit . Two years ago, the couple sold their horse after it threw Mr Fox off repeatedly, rehomed the pigs at a nearby farm when they became too big to keep in the garden and gave the chickens to their local pub. Last year, they paid £1.7million for a four-bedroom house in north London. Now they appear to have decided to stay there for good as their acting careers flourish in the capital, putting their Sussex home up for sale with an asking price of £825,000 last month. While she may prefer city life, it appears Miss Piper has not yet adjusted to the busy London traffic. She was recently quizzed by police after she collided with a cyclist while attempting a U-turn in her Volkswagen Golf near their home. She was not arrested or charged.","Billie Piper and husband Laurence Fox have bought a London townhouse .

"Finding good-quality snow all year round is near impossible for most skiers. But Marco Tomasello has found a novel way around the issue. The 36-year-old Italian, a self-described 'free-rider', has taken to speedily descending the powdered volcanic ash slopes of Mount Etna on skis, rather than waiting for winter to come. Marco Tomasello uploaded the footage to his Vimeo account on Monday and the footage has since gone viral, already garnering some 50,000 views from stunned viewers . Mr Tomasello works as a ski instructor at Les Trois Vallées in France, but in the summer acts as a tour guide on the 3,350-metre-high Mount Etna in Sicily.

"A teenage girl who felt like Frankenstein after suffering from a cancer that gave her 20 tumours in her neck has entered a beauty pageant to regain her confidence. Clemmie Huckerby, 18, was only diagnosed with thyroid cancer in June this year but has made an incredible recovery. Doctors found 20 tumours growing in her - one the size of a Satsuma - and acted quickly to remove them. Scroll down for video . Clemmie Huckerby from Great Malvern was diagnosed with thyroid cancer earlier this year. The 18-year-old had the tumours removed through surgery this summer and resulting scar left her feeling like Frankenstein . As a result of the surgery, Clemmie was left with a scar running down the side of her neck from just below her right ear. Despite the major surgery only taking place four months ago, the teenager from Great Malvern, Worcestershire, is already into the finals of Miss Worcestershire. Clemmie said: 'When I woke up from surgery I felt like Frankenstein - there was this massive scar. 'I had always been confident about my looks beforehand, but it made me really insecure. 'I'm starting to feel better about myself now and I want to use the pageant to raise awareness of thyroid cancer. 'It goes under the radar a bit and doesn't get as much press as it should.' Clemmie spent much of the summer in hospital recovering from surgery . Clemmie wasn't aware of the massive lump in her throat and only went to the doctor after weeks of being tired. As an avid horse rider, she was used to getting up early and being very active. All of a sudden the 18-year-old found it impossible to get out of bed and was constantly drained of energy. Clemmie said: 'I felt silly going to the doctors 'just' because I was tired. 'The doctor asked me to swallow and immediately noticed the lump in my throat. 'I had a biopsy that didn't show anything but a subsequent CT scan showed I had 20 tumours in my throat - one was even the size of a satsuma. The scar that was left after surgery left Clemmie feeling insecure about her looks . 'After they confirmed it was cancer I had a course of radio-iodine treatment to kill off the cancerous cells.' Since recovering from her treatment, and subsequently celebrating her 18th birthday, Clemmie has raised more than £1000 for thyroid cancer charities. She is hoping that by appearing- and hopefully winning - in the finals of Miss Worcestershire on Sunday November 2 will increase donations. The 18-year-old said: 'Of course I'd love to win - just like all of the girls involved. 'The main thing for me though is to raise awareness and make sure people are more aware of the symptoms. 'Fingers crossed we can make a bit more money too!'","Clemmie Huckerby from Great Malvern was diagnosed with thyroid cancer .

"A young British man has been arrested in Bangladesh on suspicion of recruiting would-be jihadists to fight for Islamic State terrorists in Syria and Iraq. The man, who police named as Samiun Rahman alias Ibne Hamdan, is understood to be of Bangladeshi origin and was arrested near the Kamalapur Railway area of the capital city Dhaka. He is also suspected of having attempted to recruit militants in the northern city of Sylhet - where he is understood to have relatives - having reportedly first arrived in the country about six months ago to scout for potential extremists. Scroll down for video . Militants: The young British man (third from left) named as Samiun Rahmanwas was arrested in Bangladesh . The arrested man has been identified as Samiun Rahman, sources at the media wing of Dhaka Metropolitan Police told local newspapers. He is believed to have arrived in Bangladesh in February and used social media websites including Facebook to sound out local men about their interest in joining ISIS, according Monirul Islam - joint commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police - who was speaking at a press briefing today. He targetted Muslims from Myammar as well as Bangladesh, Mr Islam added, before saying: 'He also went to Morocco and Mauritania but we are yet to know the reason behind his trips'. 'From his passport we came to know that he went to Syria in September last year and took part in the demonstration against Bashar al- Assad,' the DMP spokesperson went on to say. Investigators: Dhaka Metropolitan Police believe Samiun Rahman arrived in Bangladesh in February and used social media websites including Facebook to sound out local men about their interest in joining ISIS . The news comes just days after a 22-year-old university student - who also had links to the northern city of Sylhet - was arrested in Dhaka on suspicion of recruiting would-be fighters for ISIS. Hafizur Rahman, who was studying at Sylhet's Tibbiya Government College, was arrested in the capital's Purana Paltan area of Dhaka on Thursday after being reported for recruiting militants. Just one day before Hafizur Rahman's arrest, local police detained Asif Adnan, 26, and Fazle Elahi Tanzil, 24, who were allegedly travelling to join ISIS militants in Syria, assisted by an unnamed Briton. It is understood the suspected would-be jihadists were planning to travel to a Turkish airport popular with tourists, before travelling by road to the Syrian border and then slipping across into the warzone. Porous border: It is understood the suspected would-be jihadists were planning to travel to a Turkish airport popular with tourists, before travelling to the Syrian border (pictured) and then slipping into the warzone . Samiun Rahman's arrest came just two days after Bangladeshi detectives revealed they were searching for a London-based ISIS agent who had recruited several young men arrested in recent weeks, according to the Telegraph. Three alleged recruits were arrested last week, including the son of a retired judge and the other the son of a senior civil servant. They had been told they would travel to Syria via Turkey posing as followers of Tabligh Jamaat - an Islamic religious study group not affiliated with any terror collective. Officers first learned that a 24-year-old British man from East London had been enlisting ISIS fighters when they arrested seven young Islamic extremists, the newspaper added. Among those arrested were an associate of Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis - the 21-year-old student behind the failed 2012 attack on New York's Federal Reserve Bank. Approaching: Reports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East - an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White . Fear: Canon Andrew White, is the vicar of Baghdad's St George's Church - the only Anglican church in Iraq. Earlier Canon White had claimed the terrorist group were six miles from the city . RAF jets flew armed sorties for a second day over Iraq yesterday – but again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons. Defence chiefs insisted that the flights by Tornado GR4 fighter-bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the Islamist jihadists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria, carrying out massacres. But the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that Britain is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against Islamic State. It came as military commanders warned that Britain should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in Iraq to crush IS, which is also known as Isis and Isil. Former top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the UK could target the terrorists in Syria. While the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the RAF's third mission had – like on Saturday – failed to locate any targets, US-led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under IS control in Syria, as well as a command centre. The mobile refineries generate up to £1.2million a day for the militants. The news comes amid reports of fierce fighting in the Baghdad suburbs where ISIS militants are trying to seize control of the Iraqi capital - despite ongoing Western airstrikes against them. The fighting is taking place just one mile to the west of the city, with government forces desperately trying to hold off the militants, who allegedly killed up to 1,000 soldiers during clashes yesterday. ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country - enabling the terrorist group to seize further swaths of territory for their so-called caliphate. Reports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East - an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White, vicar of the city's St George's Church, the only Anglican church in Iraq. In a message posted on Facebook, the group said: 'The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has. 'Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little,' they added. The claims were backed up by Canon White himself, who shared the message just hours after he had earlier suggested the group were approximately six miles from Baghdad.","Local police named arrested Briton as Samiun Rahman, alias Ibne Hamdan .

"The terror group targeted by US airstrikes in Syria this week are behind the threat that caused a ban on uncharged electronic devices on American-bound flights earlier this summer, intelligence sources have claimed. The Khorasan Group was believed to be in the final stages of a plot to blow up commercial planes with toothpaste tube bombs before they were hit by air attacks overnight on Monday. This follows information received by security officials in July that the Al-Qaeda cell was close to perfecting bombs that could be packed into laptops, cell phones or tablets and pass through security without detection. Information that the Khorasan Group was close to perfecting an undetectable bomb that could be packed into electronic devices such as mobile phones prompted the TSA to up their security (file picture) According to ABC News, the concerns prompted the US Transportation Security Administration to boost surveillance and increase security at American airports. As part of the checks, security agents asked travelers to turn on their electronic devices at checkpoints and if they did not have power, they were not allowed to be taken on the plane. At the time, the Khorasan Group and radicals from other groups were believed to have been working with other elements in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Their aim was to bring down a US or Europe-bound plane with a hidden bomb, with help from one of the thousands of Americans and other foreign fighters who have joined extremist groups in the Middle East. The group is said to be made up of seasoned Al-Qaeda veterans who have travelled to Syria to find a 'safe haven'. The group's leader Muhsin al-Fadhli, 33, is thought to have been close to Osama bin Laden since around the time of September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the United States . The group's leader Muhsin al-Fadhli, 33, is thought to have been close to Osama bin Laden since around the time of September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the United States. Eric Holder, who stepped down from his post as US Attorney General earlier this week, told ABC News in July that the 'underwear bomb' threat that failed to detonate a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009 was also related to the group. He believes it is 'more frightening than anything' that has taken place during the Obama administration. They are also believed to have been behind the printer cartridge bomb plot against Chicago synagogues in 2010. The Pentagon claimed that the strikes earlier this week prevented the terror group from carrying out a plot against US airlines. Lieutenant General William Mayville, the Pentagon's director of operations, said Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from US warships in the region were used to hit the group's compounds, workshops and training grounds around the city of Aleppo. 'Intelligence reports indicated that the Khorasan Group was in the final stages of plans to execute attacks against Western targets and potentially the US homeland,' he said. Khorasan is understood to intercept Westerners travelling to fight for radical groups in Syria, including ISIS. As many of these would-be jihadists retain their passports and travel to Syria without their home nation's knowledge, Khorasan trains them not for combat in the Middle East - but rather for future terror attacks back home in the West. As part of the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and al Qaeda-affiliated groups in Syria, FBI Director James Comey has said the government is spending 'a tremendous amount of time and effort trying to identify' anyone who's gone to Syria, but 'the challenge' is not missing anyone. FBI director James Comey believes plans against the West by the Khorasan group may still be in the works, despite the air strikes by the US and five Arab airlines overnight on Monday . He told reporters today that plots against the U.S. and Europe by the Khorasan Group may still be in the works and says it's possible the air strikes have not thwarted their plans. Comey says remains at the top of the FBI's list of terrorism concerns.He added that he also worries about a homegrown attack inspired by the Islamic State group. The US and five Arab nations joined in airstrikes Monday and early Tuesday against the Islamic State group's headquarters in eastern Syria, using land- and sea-based US aircraft as well as Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from two Navy ships in the region.","Group believed to have prompted ban that was put on flights in July .

"It was one of the biggest days for the Prime Minister  as he unveiled plans for the Tory government after the 2015 election at the party's conference today. So as his number one cheerleader, his wife Samantha made sure she dressed up for the occasion. Perhaps fittingly, as her husband promised to scrap income tax, Samantha opted for an austerity-busting high street dress by Hobbs. Scroll down for video . Lady in lilac: Samantha Cameron joined her husband on stage at the Conservative party conference wearing a £99 Hobbs dress and grey court shoes . The lilac Penrose Wrap dress retails for £149, but is currently in the online sale for £99. She teamed the dress with grey court shoes from LK Bennett and a healthy glow. It was an emotional day for Samantha, who was moved to tears when her husband made a passionate defence of the NHS, which cared for their late son Ivan, who died in 2009, attacking Labour for peddling 'lies' about Tory plans for the health service. Samantha then took to the stage to congratulate her husband on his speech, within which he put two major tax cuts at the heart of his bid for re-election. First lady of fashion: Samantha's Penrose Wrap dress retails for £149, but is currently in the online sale for £99 . Support system: Samantha then took to the stage to congratulate her husband on his speech, within which he put two major tax cuts at the heart of his bid for re-election . Emotional: Samantha was moved to tears when her husband made a passionate defence of the NHS, which cared for their late son Ivan . Yesterday, she look chic in an on-trend black midi skirt, paired with a khaki silk blouse and black heels as she arrived to watch her husband rehearse. The warm September sunshine enabled her to go bare-legged and without a coat, although she held a black scarf in her hand as she made her way into the hotel. On arrival in Birmingham, however, Samantha, 43, embraced a more androgynous style than today. Here for you: Samantha was keen to support her husband ahead of today's conference . All smiles: Samantha was beaming with pride as she escorted David at today's conference . Wearing a pinstriped blue and white shirt, not dissimilar to the one her husband David was sporting, dark cord trousers and navy heels, the mother-of-three exuded an understated yet chic style. While fashion editors have quietly been championing mannish shirts for months, are we ready for cords to make a comeback from the 90s? Christopher Tennant, style writer at the Wall Street Journal, said: 'Banish all thoughts of preppy high-schoolers and '70s flares. Corduroy is cultivating a more refined air. Trendsetter? Samantha Cameron is well-known in the industry for her sartorial wardrobe choices and as she arrived with husband David ahead of the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, she rocked an androgynous style . It's a man's world: Crisp tailored shirts and trousers have been the fash-pack's wardrobe essentials so far this season and it seems that Mrs Cameron has taken note . 'Corduroy can be groovily retro or preppy and professorial. It has a reputation as a bit of a workaday fabric, but good, 100 per cent cotton corduroy is like velvet in its richness and is fantastic to work with.' Androgynous dressing is certainly the style de rigeur. The high street has witnessed sales of trouser suits soar by 157 per cent after recent awards ceremonies such as the Baftas and the Oscars, where fashion's finest were championing the trend. Sophisticated Sam: Mrs Cameron opted for muted tones while attending David's keynote to speech at the Conservative Party's annual conference however she kept the outfit exciting with a daring flash of leg . Style icons Cara Delevingne, Kourtney Kardashian, Madonna and Ellen Degeneres have been embracing the manly look since the start of the year and the red carpets were blanketed in ladies’ tuxes. Androgynous dressing is back on the style agenda but that doesn’t mean you have to look manly. 'Clean-lined suits with cuts in the right places can look feminine and flattering as shown at Jil Sander, Tods and Versace,' said fashion blogger Lydia Faye Jones. Although the look has been a celebrity favourite on the red carpet, it has crossed over into everyday wear with sales of plain black and navy trouser suits up by 157 per cent along with white shirts increasing by 105 per cent at Debenhams. Clearly Samantha, who quickly became  an ambassador for British style when husband David  was made Prime Minister in May 2010, is up-to-date with the trends (her sister does work for Vogue, after all). She often wins over style critics for her love of mixing  high end designer, such as Roksanda Ilincic, Erdem and Phillip Lim - with high street options such as Zara and L.K. Bennett. She also hosts a party at Downing Street every season to celebrate London fashion week, with this year's esteemed guests including Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss. Shaking up her style: Samantha is well known for mixing high street with high-end and chops and changes between a more masculine style, left, and feminine dresses, right .

And now the fruity delicacy is a step closer to having Protected Geographical Indicator (PGI) status - already granted to Scottish produce such as Stornoway black pudding and Arbroath smokies. This means that only Dundee Cakes made in Dundee and following the traditional recipe can legally be called Dundee cakes. The humble Dundee cake is a step closer to having Protected Geographical Indicator Status . Scotland's Food Secretary Richard Lochhead visited a Dundee bakery to launch the consultation . Scotland's Food Secretary Richard Lochhead visited a Dundee bakery to launch the consultation. He said: 'Dundee is famous as a city of discoveries and we want the world to discover delicious, authentic Dundee Cake. 'We can trace its origins back hundreds of years to the kitchens of the marmalade inventor Janet Keiller, making it a thoroughly Dundonian delicacy which deserves European recognition for its unique characteristics and long associations with this city. 'Scotland is world-famous for our wonderful food and drink, and people want to know they are buying the real deal. 'Achieving PGI status for Dundee Cake will ensure that consumers at home and abroad have a one hundred per cent guarantee of the product's authenticity.

"As far as Halloween costume accessories go, a full-size, real-life skeleton horse is definitely something to make the un-dead walk again. Horse tack maker Sandy Cramer has turned  her filly Raven into a walking skeleton to celebrate the holiday of tacky terror. Ms Cramer first painted her beloved horse three years ago, and since then, Raven's 'Skeleton Horse' getup has made her an internet sensation. Bony bareback: Raven the horse has been turned into a 'Skeleton Horse' to celebrate Halloween . Ms Cramer, from Rockbridge, Ohio, first painted Raven to enter a Halloween photo contest on Facebook in 2011. The 'Skeleton Horse' became so popular that Ms Cramer is bringing it back for a fourth time this year. Using non-toxic, acrylic craft paint, Ms Cramer has been turning Raven into a scary skeleton since the beginning of the month to promote her pet shop and horse tack business. It takes Ms Cramer about three hours to complete the transformation, which is completely harmless, and the  paint can be washed off with just water and a brush. What a costume: Ms Cramer first painted Raven in 2011, and since then, Raven's skeletal getup has made her an internet sensation . Whitewash: Ms Cramer spends three hours-a-day in the weeks leading up to Halloween painting her horse . Ms Cramer has been incorporating Raven into four different costumes which the pair have been modelling to attract business to her shop. 'People love Raven as a Skeleton Horse,' Ms Cramer says. 'I have people tell me that the only reason they stopped at my shop is because they saw Raven and I walking around and had to come see us up close. 'This Halloween, we will be in costume together down at our shop and if weather is decent, we may go take part in the local trick-or-treat around town. 'Each weekend up to Halloween and including Halloween day Raven and I get in costume together.' Creepy costume: Ms Cramer and Raven are dressed up as a headless hunter and its steed . I'm outta here:  Raven gallops away from attention after posing for pictures in the skeletal paint . 'The paint does in fact wash off with water and a cury brush, so it's no worse than washing off mud. 'To her, it's no different than standing there getting a good grooming. 'I have been painting my horses for about five years now as I would paint them for our local Indian Pow-wow as Indian War Horses.

"Tim Krul was brought on in the last minute of extra-time JUST for the penalty shootout . Newcastle goalkeeper saved two of five spot-kicks to send Holland through . Tim Krul distracted Costa Rica’s penalty-takers by telling them he already knew which direction their kick was going in – but it appears he had another technique to influence his opponents. For video footage of the shootout shows Krul deliberately walking to one side of his goal before four of the five penalties, diving to the opposite corner once the effort was taken. And on each occasion the Holland goalkeeper guessed right, saving from Bryan Ruiz and Michael Umana to send the Dutch into the semi-finals. Mind games: Tim Krul says he told Costa Rica's players he knew which direction their penalties were going . Super sub: Holland's Tim Krul makes the decisive save to deny Costa Rica's Michael Umana in the shoot-out .

Louis van Gaal has been praised for the psychological advantage the introduction of Krul gave his men. But the substitute played his own part, as he revealed: ‘I watched them [Costa Rica] against Greece and studied them and I told the players that I knew where they were going to shoot to make them a bit nervous. ‘Maybe it worked. It happened before when I played against Frank Lampard. I told him that I knew and I saved it. I just tried that again. I’m so happy it worked.’ But did Krul’s pre-penalty routine tempt the Costa Ricans into picking their corner? Judge for yourself by taking a look at our graphic below… .

"Police have charged two men, one of whose remote property was dug up earlier this year by cold case murder detectives, over one of Australia's most notorious unsolved killings. The men, named by Channel 9 as Vincent O'Dempsey and Gary Dubois have been charged over the murder of Barbara McCulkin and her two daughters Vicki and Leanne, who have not been seen since January 16, 1974. The three vanished from their home in Highgate Hill, south of Brisbane, after two men were seen visiting the property more than 40 years ago. Their bodies have never been found. After reopening the case in January this year - and after a murder charge in 1980 which was later dropped - detectives on Saturday charged O'Dempsey and Dubois with three counts of murder, three counts of deprivation of liberty and other serious offences. They will front Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday. 76-year-old Vincent O'Dempsey, who was charged today with his co-accused 67-year-old Gary Dubois over the 40-year-old notorious cold murder case of Barbara McCulkin and her daughters Vicki and Leanne . Police say the two men have been charged with three counts of murder, three counts of deprivation of liberty and other serious offences . O'Dempsey was formerly charged with the murder in 1980, but the case was dropped due to insufficient evidence . Ms McCulkin was the estranged wife of Jimmy McCulkin, a debt collector with underworld connections . Channel 9 footage showed 76 year old O'Dempsey being driven into a Brisbane police station, where he was later formally charged. Detective Superintendent Steve Holahan said: 'It's extremely pleasing, particularly for the investigators. It's been a very intense sand relentless investigation.' He added the arrests were the result of years of hard work by many investigators and specialist officers, particularly since the renewed investigation began in January. Since the case was reopened, police have spoken to a number of people in Queensland, leading to them a rural property in Warwick, which O'Dempsey was operating. In August, police raided the rural property, which was an alpaca farm allegedly run by O'Dempseys as front for a marijuana operation. Detectives from the Warwick Criminal Investigation Branch, Homicide Cold Case Unit and State Drug and Serious Crime Illicit Laboratories Investigation Team (ILIT) used an excavator to unearth a shipping container which they believe had been buried for years. LIT members used breathing apparatus to examine the contents of the container. They allegedly found barrels filled with bags of cannabis, as well as a loaded gun and over $570,000 in cash reports Courier Mail. Thomas 'Teddy' Martin was charged with drug and weapons offences. He has no connection to the McCulkin murder case. In August, Police raided the rural property, which was an alpaca farm allegedly run by O'Dempseys as front for a marijuana operation . Warwick detectives allegedly found barrels filled with bags of cannabis, as well as a loaded gun and over $570,000 in cash . The McCulkin case has gripped Australia for over 40 years. Mrs McCulkin was the estranged wife of Jimmy McCulkin, a debt collector with underworld connections. On January 16, 1974, she  and her daughters Vicky and Leanne were at home in the Brisbane suburb of Highgate Hill. It was school holidays, and the girls had returned from a birthday party. One of the daughter's friends noticed two men visited the property at an unspecified time, and Mrs McCulkin and her two daughters vanished, never to be seen again. O'Dempsey and Dubois were charged with the three murders in 1980 but the charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence. Saturday's arrest of the two men who have long been the focus of the case is the most significant breakthrough since the former charges were dropped. Detective Holahan said that the arrests 'reinforce that the Queensland Police and committed to solving serious crimes, regardless of when they were committed or where.'

Police have yet to reveal a motive or where they believe the alleged murders took place, however Det. Holahan said 'the investigation looked at all different motives and movements of persons of interest.' A number of potential witnesses gave evidence at Crime and Corruption Commission hearings which looked into the case earlier this year. 'The renewed investigation and use of coercive powers has gathered significant evidence without which the arrests would not have been possible,' Det Supt Holahan said.

"The mother of Prue Bird who disappeared more than twenty years ago when she was 13 has spoken of the moment she realised her daughter was missing. Jenny Bird said she had felt uneasy throughout the day on February 2, 1992, but had tried to 'pushing' it away. Ms Bird finally received some closure when Leslie Camilleri - who is known as the Bega schoolgirl killer - was sentenced for 28 years in 2013 for her murder. Scroll down for video . Jenny Bird has spoken out about the moment she realised her daughter, Prue, was missing from their Melbourne home . Camilleri has maintained her acted alone and Prue's body has never been found. On Monday night, Ms Bird told Australian Story about the fear she felt when her daughter disappeared and how she was still convinced her murder had ties with the 1986 Russell Street bombing that killed a Melbourne police woman. Prue's story is covered in a two-part series airing on the ABC. Ms Bird said she remembered everything that happened on February 2. Prue Bird, 13, went missing on February 2, 1992, and her killer was convicted of murder in 2013 . The mother had just come home from the local pool when she noticed her daughter had left her meal of creamed corn untouched on the coffee table inside their Glenroy home - north of Melbourne. 'No note in the kitchen and as all as a bugger Prue was, we did leave notes,' Ms Bird said. 'All her clothes were still there, all the money was still there like her pocket money and stuff.' Ms Bird's first port of call was contacting Prue's friend to see if she was hanging out with them, but when she was told this was not the case, panic started up. 'I just knew from that moment - ""Oh my God, my little girl is in trouble somewhere"", she said. Bega schoolgirl killer Leslie Camilleri was sentenced to 28 years in prison for Prue's murder in 2013 . Despite her daughter's killer being behind bars, Ms Bird is still convinced Prue's disappearance was tied to the 1982 Russell Street bombing. Ms Bird's mother Julie Hetzel met Paul Hetzel while he was serving time in prison for armed robbery and attempted murder. Paul Hetzel was associated with men convicted of the bombing - Craig 'Fatty' Minogue, Stan Taylor and Peter Reed - and Rodney Minogue who was acquitted of the crime. Ms Hetzel claims Mr Minogue made threats against her granddaughter's safety if she or her husband went to the police with information about their involvement in bombing. Prue's psychiatrist also reveals 13-year-old told of a car that was following her in the days leading up to her disappearance. 'In the last one or two visits Prue had stated to one of my colleagues that she had been followed by a car two or three times and it was the same car and it was in the street near her home,' Dr Helen Driscoll said. 'I talked to Prue about it also and the concern was is she imagining things, is her mental state all right? She wasn't, her mental state was fine... and that was the last session that I saw Prue alive.'","Prue Bird was 13 when she went missing from her Melbourne home in 1992 .

"The broadcasting regulator has criticised Sky News after one of its star reporters was seen picking through the possessions of people killed when flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine. Ofcom said more than 200 people complained after Colin Brazier rifled through the victims' bags at the crash scene in July this year, three days after the Malaysia Airlines passenger jet was taken down with the loss of all 298 people on board. Today the regulator said the live television broadcast on 20 July caused 'considerable offence' and breached its rule that says offensive material must be justified by the context. Scroll down for video . Offensive broadcast: Sky News reporter Colin Brazier was seen picking through crash victims' possessions . An Ofcom investigation found that Brazier caused 'considerable offence' not mitigated by his apology . A report by the watchdog published this morning said: 'Ofcom received 205 complaints from viewers who were offended by Mr Brazier picking up items from the suitcase of one of the victims... 'Mr Brazier stood amongst the belongings of some of the victims of the tragedy... Having described some of the items he could see, he then crouched down and briefly picked up a water bottle and then a set of keys from an open suitcase.' It described how he suggested the items belonged to 'a small girl... by the look of things' before almost immediately adding: 'We shouldn't really be doing this, I suppose'. The Ofcom investigation said: 'Mr Brazier handled two items belonging to a victim of the crash very briefly, and he appeared to almost immediately regret his actions and expressed this to viewers. 'Nonetheless, in Ofcom's view these actions were capable of causing considerable offence and this was not mitigated by an immediate broadcast apology. 'On balance we therefore considered that the offence was not justified by the context and Rule 2.3 was breached.' However the watchdog said the breach was considered resolved after Brazier, 46, and Sky News apologised hours after the broadcast, and the reporter wrote a full apology in a newspaper two days later. Doomed: Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 as it took off from Schipol airport in Amsterdam on 17 July 2014 . Ofcom said it also took into account the 'unusual and emotionally charged situation' Brazier found himself reporting on, and said that it meant he had to take 'particularly challenging' editorial decisions. After the event Brazier, a father of six, said he spotted the pink drinking flask because it was identical to one possessed by his six-year-old daughter. He then said he 'lost it' and broke down in tears while on air as he looked at the victims' possessions. However the older brother of Leeds University student Richard Mayne, who was one of ten Britons to die in the crash, said the television reporter's actions were 'sick'. Speaking soon after the broadcast this summer, Thomas Mayne, 24, said: 'It's sick and the worst example of news journalism which is sensationalising an appalling human tragedy.' Brazier is described by Sky News as one of its 'most widely travelled' reporters who has previously been honoured for his reporting in Afghanistan. Oftcom also said that Brazier's 'brief but significant lapse of judgement' should not prevent broadcast journalists from reporting on live and sensitive news stories in future.","Colin Brazier reported live for Sky News from the site in eastern Ukraine .

"Authorities say a wild black bear ate most of a Northern California man who likely died earlier of a heart attack in his trailer and was pulled from the site by the animal. Local Deputy Coroner Roy Horton said Friday he believes 65-year-old Marion Williams died outside his trailer in a remote area of southern Humboldt. Authorities discovered the remains on Monday. Friends of the father-of-two - a popular community volunteer who also went by the name Rainbow Mountain Walker - became worried when he didn't show up for a planned motorcycle ride on Saturday, according to local newspaper The Lost Coast Outpost. Body found: Marion Williams, 65 - also known as Rainbow Mountain Walker - was found almost completely eaten in the woods near his trailer in a remote area of Southern Humboldt, California . Scene: Williams, a father-of-two, lived in a trailer in a remote part of Southern Humboldt, near Redway, Calif. Then a friend when to Williams' home on Sunday to check on him. Upon arriving he noticed the trailer was in disarray, but Williams' cellphone, keys and vehicle were still there. When the friend couldn't find Williams, he did a call around . A search party was organized for Monday and the body was found nearby. Williams' daughter, Liberty, told The Outpost it was obvious her father's body had been dragged off by a large animal, most likely a bear. Authorities identified the body using fingerprints. California Department of Fish and Wildlife spokesman Andrew Hughan says officials want to trap and kill the bear but have called off their search because it is doubtful the bear is still in the area near Redway, about 75 miles south of Humboldt. Animal encounter: Authorities believe a black bear happened across the dead body of Marion Williams, dragged it off into the woods and ate it. Pictured here is a black bear in Sequoia National Park, California . They have not released a cause of death for Williams, but there is evidence he died before the attack. That evidence was not disclosed. Williams' daughter described him as 'an open-hearted, caring person who wanted to help everyone out… . He wanted to see his community do better', according to The Outpost. Every year he would serve Christmas and Thanksgiving to the homeless. Helping street people was a great passion of his. A memorial is currently being organized.","The body of Marion Williams, 65, was found almost completely eaten on Monday near his trailer in a remote part of Southern Humboldt, California .

"Former Brazil international Juninho will join the BBC's World Cup coverage as a pundit. The 41-year-old, who lifted the World Cup with his country in 2002, earned huge popularity in England during three spells with Middlesbrough and his opinions on the tournament in his homeland will add valuable insight. He joins Thierry Henry and Rio Ferdinand as big names lined up by the Corporation. Juninho earned fame on these shores when was he signed by Boro boss Bryan Robson in October 1995 for £4.75million in a huge coup for the club, where he is considered one of the all-time greats. Boys from Brazil: Juninho (right), pictured here with Roberto Carlos, will be part of the BBC's World Cup team . He had won the Copa Libertadores with Sao Paolo and was wanted by top European sides but moved to Teesside as part of an exciting team funded by owner Steve Gibson. Juninho's diminutive stature - he is only 5ft 5in - meant he became known as 'The Little Fella', while stories of him playing football in the streets with local children earned him great favour. On the pitch he was an instant success in an attacking role and in the 1996-97 helped Boro to both the League Cup and FA Cup finals, and came runner-up to Gianfranco Zola in the voting for the FWA's Footballer of the Year. Boro star: Juninho made his name in England playing for Middlesbrough . Star turn: Juninho won 49 caps for Brazil and has a World Cup winner's medal in his trophy cabinet . Crying game: Juninho famously wept on the pitch after Boro lost their place in the top flight 1997 . But he was unable to stop Robson's team being relegated from the Premier League after a three-point deduction and was reduced to tears on the final day of the season after a 1-1 draw with Leeds United confirmed the drop. A £12million sale to Atletico Madrid followed but a broken leg ruined his chances of making the Brazil squad for France 98 and he returned to Boro on loan for the 1999-2000 season, playing alongside Paul Gascoigne and Paul Ince as the side finished 12th. There were more loan spells with Vasco Da Gama and Flamengo which in 2002 earned him a spot in Luiz Felipe Scolari's World Cup squad. Juninho started all three group games and the last-16 tie against Belgium but lost his place to Kleberson for the quarter-final victory over England. BBC team: Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand, Gary Lineker, Thierry Henry, Gabby Logan and Alan Hansen . Heading to Rio: Robbie Savage, Brad Friedel and Chris Waddle will join Lineker and Ferdinand in Brazil . He came on as a substitute in the 85th minute of the 2-0 final win over Germany. That summer, aged 29, he re-joined a Boro team managed by Steve McClaren in a £6m deal. Two consecutive 11th placed finishes followed as well as his first trophy in English football with the 2004 League Cup. He played in the 2-1 final win over Bolton Wanderers at the Millenium Stadium and has said that trophy rivals the World Cup because of his major role. 'I always said this title means a lot to me, especially when you feel a real part of winning the title,' he said. Juninho then signed Celtic for a season before returning to Brazil as well as spending one campaign at Sydney FC. It is his time on Teesside for which he will be best remembered. In all he played 155 games for Boro, scoring 33 goals and winning many more plaudits. He also won 49 international caps and scored five goals.","Former Brazil star Juninho signs up as World Cup pundit .

"The little rockhopper penguin has finally reached the top of the cliff. It has been a bit of a struggle, all those jumps from edge to edge, all those setbacks when big waves pull him down again into the sea. But now he can rest and let the wind ruffle the tufts of yellow feathers above his eyes. Bird is the word: The Falkland Islands are home to an astonishing population of gentoo penguins . And behind him, in stark counterpoint to . this everyday routine of a bird colony, rises the dramatic steel cross . of the HMS Sheffield memorial, a reminder that just a few miles across . these waters the destroyer was hit by an Exocet missile with the loss of . the lives of 20 men. It is a moment that could sum up the Falklands Islands. For although life would have probably gone on pretty much the same for the rockhoppers and all the other wildlife creatures, it would have changed forever for the islanders had the Argentinian invasion succeeded in 1982. Back through three decades: The memorial at Goose Green remembers the British dead of that key battle . Instead it was defeated by the Task Force which sailed 8,000 miles to achieve victory in the South Atlantic. The price was 255 British and 655 Argentine dead, with hundreds wounded on both sides. Today in this peaceful and pristine landscape, it is hard to imagine how fiercely battle raged in places like San Carlos, Goose Green, Mount Tumbledown and the hills around the capital Stanley. At the same time, though, you never feel far from some legacy of the war. It is there, of course, as soon as you arrive at Mount Pleasant airport and its adjoining military base, where 1300 servicemen and women are stationed to guarantee the security of this overseas territory. It is there . in the discreet little leaflet you are handed at immigration reminding . visitors in English and Spanish not to remove anything from battlefields . or display any Argentine flags. And . it is certainly there in the minefields which still border the main . road - although they are now all clearly marked and cordoned off. Light and breezy: Port Stanley is full of colourful houses which give it a bright complexion . In Stanley, there is a fine official memorial. But perhaps even more touching is the special wood with a tree planted for every British life lost. In San Carlos, there is the British cemetery which commemorates not just those buried there but their comrades who died at sea. In the Argentinian cemetery in Darwin, there are rows of white crosses, more than half of them for conscripts who were not given dog tags, marked Soldado Argentino Solo Conocido Por Dios – known only unto God. It is almost impossible not to be moved by these places. Families from both sides come to the islands, as do veterans - not only to pay their respects to the fallen, but sometimes also to seek comfort for themselves. You can see how consolation might be found here. The . beauty of the Falklands lies not in its scenery - which, apart from its . ‘stone runs’ - dramatic cascades of huge rocks sweeping down the . hillsides - is generally pretty bleak and unexciting. Feathered friends: The islands are home to over 200 bird species, including adorable geese . Instead it is to be found in the coastal crags and the lovely beaches, in the clear ever-changing light and in the surrounding waters, dark navy in one spot, Caribbean turquoise in another. Then there is the wildlife: seals, sealions, dolphins, orca, even a passing whale if you are lucky. And thousands and thousands of birds from 200 species, including five kinds of penguin. And this is birdwatching made easy - no hanging about for hours in hides or endlessly fiddling with binoculars. Upland geese leisurely cross the road in front of your car. Albatross chicks let you stand within a few feet without batting an eyelid. One day I had a couple of caracara hawks playing ‘Grandmother’s footsteps’ behind me, tailing me down a hillside, freezing when I stopped and turned - and then following me again when I moved. If you sit patiently in certain areas, curious young gentoo penguins will waddle up to peck your bootlace or even nibble at an outstretched hand. Shards of the old world: Port Stanley plays host to Christ Church Cathedral (left), and even red phone boxes . At times it seems the wildlife is actually competing for your attention. On a choppy but exhilarating boat crossing to West Point Island we spotted dozens of albatross, petrels and cormorants in a great feeding and fishing frenzy. And just as I was gawping at this spectacle, a school of dolphins appeared, swooping under the boat and leaping out of the water. It was as if they were all claiming ‘Look at me’, ‘No look at me’, ‘No coo-ee, over here please’. West Point was my only boat trip, as most inter-island travel is done by plane - for the simple reason that the Falklands archipelago is the size of Wales, and that getting from Stanley in the east to, say, Carcass Island in the west, might be a 50-minute flight with stop-offs as residents return to their far flung ‘settlements’, home from a shopping trip or a family party, or a Saturday-night date in Stanley. On one flight, I am the only passenger in the ten-seater Britten Norman Islander plane. Echoes of Britain: Port Stanley holds ties to North Yorkshire via a twinning relationship with Whitby . So I sit up front and chat to Eddie the pilot, who tells me: 'People see the islands as a speck on an atlas. So when they get here, they’re amazed at the scale.' Normally white-knuckled at the slightest bump of turbulence, I am astounded at just how much I enjoy these flights - skimming over the water at a couple of hundred feet on one; soaring above the clouds on another; taking off from a grass airstrip from which a cow has just been shooed; watching my hosts put up a windsock and radio a visibility report to the pilot. Taking the air route: Many journeys between the islands are flown by little Britten-Norman aircraft . Almost everything about the Falklands could be described as hardy: the planes, the all-terrain vehicles, the vegetation, the sheep, the wildlife. The same goes for the people: resourceful, resilient, often doing two jobs, sometimes a little reserved initially, but eventually warm and welcoming. And although on some days the wind can whip up from the Antarctic and penetrate five layers of clothing, there is no shortage of home comforts and good food. The upland goose pate is delicious, the squid some of the best I’ve ever tasted and the baking for ‘Smoko’ – once a break for sheep shearers, now another word for elevenses – could have held its own at any W.I. fair. There are around 2,500 islanders now, the majority living in Stanley, which has brightly painted houses, a promenade, a fine cathedral and several lively cafes and pubs with signs in the window saying ‘Heroes Welcome Here’. It feels rather like an old-style English seaside town. A shadow still falls: Minefields still exist in the Falklands - though they are carefully marked . Despite its fervent patriotism – only three people voted no in last year’s referendum about staying British – it would be a mistake to think of the place as an isolated ‘Little Britain’. Economic success with fishing licences and the discovery of oil mean that, at the last count, there were 60 different nationalities on the islands. Even in ‘Camp’ - the word for everywhere outside Stanley - you will be guaranteed as fascinating a conversation with your hosts as with your fellow guests. Journey .

"We may not have the funds to check in to these luxurious lodgings, but one can dream... A recent study from New World Wealth has explored the top hotel choices for multi-millionaires - both in the UK and abroad. Globally, Las Vegas takes top honours as the destination of choice for millionaires, with both The Bellagio and Caesars Palace appearing in the top three. Scroll down for video . Where do the super-rich stay on holiday? The Bellagio in Las Vegas has 6,400 multi-millionaire visits per year . In second place, New York City's The Plaza Hotel racked up 3,700 millionaire visitors from 2013-2014 . The Waldorf Astoria, in New York City, and Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, also prove popular . And in fifth place, the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore saw 3,100 super-rich visitors check in . For the purposes of the study, multi-millionaires are defined as having net assets of at least US$10million, around £6million. The study is based on data collected from 20,000 global multi-millionaires and tracks hotel stays between June 2013 and June 2014. Interestingly, Las Vegas hotels dominate the list, reflecting Sin City's appeal as a short-stay holiday spot. The Plaza's top ranking is also impressive, given that the hotel only has 280 rooms, meaning its at a disadvantage against larger hotels that can accommodate more people. 1.

When it comes to the UK, however, it's The Ritz in London that reigns supreme - coming in at number seven globally and number one in the country with 2,600 millionaire visitors in the past year. The Mandarin Oriental in Knightsbridge and Claridge's in Mayfair also score highly, though Claridge's remains mostly popular among business travellers. The Ritz and the Mandarin Oriental, however, are particularly favoured among visitors from the Middle East and Asia. The convenient location of The Savoy makes it a popular pick for those looking to take in a show on the West End, while The Berkeley is popular among North American tourists. It's perhaps unsurprising that the bulk of multi-millionaires visiting the UK head to London, but there are some super-rich visitors heading to places such as Edinburgh, Bath, Oxford, Cambridge and several small towns in South East England. London's swanky hotel, The Ritz, came in seventh globally and first in the UK, with 2,600 millionaire visitors . The hotel, located in Piccadilly, first opened its doors in 1906 and has been a London fixture ever since . With a great deal of suites available to book, many opt for the breathtaking Green Park and skyline views . Stays begin at £780 per night for a Super Queen,  with The Prince of Wales Suite coming in at £10,200 . Another popular elite London hotel is the five-star Mandarin Oriental, located in Knightsbridge . Claridge's also remains popular among the wealthy, with 1,900 super-rich guests passing through last year . The Ritz in London has long been a bastion of opulence in the capital, since it first opened its doors - at its iconic 150 Piccadilly address - in 1906. The property offers seven stunning styles of suites, decorated in the lavish style of Louis XVI, with the signature Prince of Wales Suite priced at £10,200 per night. And, of course, for those staying in either the Prince of Wales or the Royal Suite, access to a 24-hour butler is included. The hotel's three distinctive dining options are also not to be missed - especially Afternoon Tea at The Palm Court - and during the holidays, the chefs curate special seasonal offerings, like limited-edition Christmas puddings.","New World Wealth report finds most popular hotels for multi-millionaires .

"A recording of Shelly Sterling's frantic 911 call to report V. Stiviano breaking into her Beverly Hills mansion has been released, in which she reveals her husband Donald's ex-girlfriend entered the house through a side-door and was 'tormenting him'. Southern California real estate mogul Donald Sterling lost ownership of the L.A. Clippers basketball team in August when it was revealed that he made racist statements to Stiviano after she posted a picture with NBA legend Magic Johnson on Instagram. When police arrived at his house following his wife's call, Sterling told them that Stiviano was an 'invited guest'. The 911 call started rumors that Sterling was back with Stiviano, despite the controversy surrounding the tapes and the fact that he and wife Shelly are actively engaged in a legal battle with his ex-mistress. Scroll down for audio . Help: Shelly Sterling called 911 earlier this month to report a break-in at her Beverly Hills mansion. She told police that V Stiviano sneaked in through a side-door and was 'tormenting' her husband. Pictured above at a Los Angeles Clippers game on May 15. She and husband Donald Sterling were forced to sell the team this summer amid a racism scandal . No problem here: When police arrived at the home, Donald Sterling (pictured with glasses) told law enforcement that Stiviano (right) was his 'invited guest'. Stiviano was allegedly his mistress for a few years . Mrs Sterling was out of town on October 1 when her gardener called to say that  Stiviano had 'broke into the house' using a side door. Fame seeker: In the midst of the scandal that cost Sterling his team, Stiviano was pictured out and about L.A. in a series of strange attention-grabbing costumes . 'She's in an upstairs bedroom. You gotta go there fast because she's dangerous,' Mrs Sterling says in the recording released by TMZ. It appears Mrs Sterling didn't call her husband, before she dialed Beverly Hills police from France to report the'break in'. When asked to described the female intruder, Mrs Sterling called Stiviano an 'African black' and mentioned several times that she and her husband have an active lawsuit against her. The lawsuit, which predates the Clippers scandal, accuses Stiviano of taking gifts from the Sterling family including a Ferrari, $240,000 in cash and a $1.8million home in exchange for sexual favors. Stiviano has fought these charges, claiming that Sterling is actually a gay man who used her to hide his sexual orientation and that he paid for the lavish gifts with his own money. She said the female intruder was 'stressed about the suit' When the 911 operator asks for her husband's phone number, to check that he is alright, Mrs Sterling refuses. 'Well don't call him because he'll say nothing is happening it's OK because he doesn't want to have the problem so please don't call,' she said. About six police officers were dispatched to the scene and when they arrived, they talked to Sterling and let Stiviano stay at the house as his guest. Following the scandal in which the NBA forced him to sell his team, Mrs Sterling stepped in as a representative of the family and helped broker the record-breaking deal to sell the Clippers to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2billion. Ballmer officially became the new owner of the clippers at the end of August. Separated: Shelly Sterling and husband Donald are still married, despite being estranged for some years. She represented the family when the NBA ordered Sterling to sell his team, and brokered the record-breaking deal to transfer ownership of the team to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2billion .","The wife of former L.A.

Amanda Bynes 'was in touch with Britney Spears' controversial ex-manager Sam Lutfi' ...hours before she was placed under 5150 psychiatric hold on Friday . Sam followed up Bynes' tweet, responding to Perez Hilton, saying: 'She's in good hands now. Many thanks to all those that helped along the way.' And now Perez claims Bynes has told them: 'Last time I trusted Lutfi he put me in a conservatorship which ended in August I'm not stupid. 'You are all listening to my brain…I can handle Sam, he just flew me back to LA and I'm going to meet some sick lawyers.' Lutfi has strenuously denied any claims that he was responsible for Britney's meltdown. On his Twitter bio, he says he was 'FALSELY accused of doing horrible things by horrible people.'

I was forced to live with my dad which was a total nightmare.' Whereabouts unknown:The 28-year-old wore the same clothing as she did when she flew into the city last week, pictured, and was last seen headed to JFK airport . A few minutes later her tweets took an even more disturbing turn. She wrote to her more than 3 million followers: 'My dad fondled himself in front of me so many times that I started recording him on my phone in hopes of catching him... saying or doing something inappropriate around me so I could get him arrested & put in jail for the rest of his perverted life.' Two hours later, Amanda recanted her statements and, in doing so, revealed the extent of her mental illness. Taking the abusive comments back she said: 'My dad never did any of those things. The microchip in my brain made me say those things but he's the one that ordered them to microchip me.' But the damage was already done with her mother Lynn issuing a statement saying she was 'heartbroken' over what her daughter had said.

"For man's best friend, the lure of the great outdoors can send even the stumpiest tail wagging in  excitement. But one timid dog is so petrified of what lurks outside her kennel that she rarely ever meets other dogs and their owners. Staff at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home hope a televised appeal with Paul O'Grady will help the agoraphobic dog, named Whisper, find a new permanent place to live. Whisper, the six-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier, is agoraphobic, and rarely meets other people or dogs . Battersea senior animal welfare assistant Karen Slavid has slowly built a rapport with the Staffordshire Bull Terrier by sitting quietly in the her kennel and feeding her. Ms Slavid said: 'Whisper is a gentle, loving, kind-natured dog, and she is going to make the most amazing pet for someone who has the time and patience to slowly build her trust and confidence. 'We know that she's going to need very understanding owners but more than anything we want her to enjoy a life outside kennels like any other dog. Whisper has had a terrible start to life and she really deserves a happy ending.' It is thought Whisper had been used as a breeding bitch before being brought to Battersea as a stray . While most rescue dogs love going for walks, Whisper will only leave her kennel once all the other dogs are in bed for the night and the staff and visitors have gone home. Only when the grounds are deserted for the day does she feel it is safe to venture outside. Battersea staff have encountered all sorts of behaviour over the years, but agoraphobic Whisper is one of the most extreme cases they have ever faced. The six-year-old has been with Battersea staff since she was found cowering underneath a bush in Surrey in January. It is thought Whisper had been used as a breeding bitch before being brought to Battersea's Old Windsor Home as a stray.

But Accrington Stanley posted on Twitter: . 'To increase the number of English players in the top flight we're . going to launch a B team & apply to join the Premier League.'

The tweet has received over 3,000 retweets to date, though the club mentioned afterwards that it was just a joke. In the 2012-13 Premier League season only 32 per cent of starts were made by English players, compared with 69 per cent 20 years ago. Dyke's aim, according to the report the FA produced on Thursday,  is to have 90 English players playing more than 50 per cent of games in the top five European Leagues.","Greg Dyke confirms plans for new division of Premier League B-Teams .

"FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert caught the governing body by surprise with his vow to make public next month significant parts of the Garcia report into World Cup bidding corruption. Zurich had been briefing up to last Thursday night that Eckert’s November statement would be nothing more than a progress report on his study of Michael Garcia’s findings about the flawed 2018 and 2022 votes. But Eckert told FIFA.com that the ‘statement will contain an overview of the investigation report, a summary of the main findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report, as well as a brief evaluation of the same’. Hans-Joachim Eckert will reveal key elements of the Garcia report into World Cup bidding corruption . The differing stances demonstrate at least that Eckert’s adjudicatory chamber are acting independently of the FIFA executive, who have not seen any of the four copies of Garcia’s findings. It is thought Eckert will recommend charges are brought against a double-digit number of personnel involved in the bids but not that the World Cup be taken away from Qatar. The full Garcia report will not be published to protect witness confidentiality and for legal reasons. Garcia, as an American citizen, did not investigate the Russia and USA bids. Manchester United coach Nicky Butt told guests at the HMV Football Extravaganza this week that he and his Class of 92 colleagues don’t particularly like being bracketed with that name. But that hasn’t stopped them exploiting it commercially for all its worth. Manchester United coach Nicky Butt (centre) does not like to be bracketed as being part of the 'Class of 92' Emirates, the only one of FIFA’s six top-tier sponsors not to comment on the need for an inquiry after the allegations around corrupt World Cup bidding, are said to be wavering on whether to continue their backing in Russia in 2018. The Dubai-based airline are believed to have worries about FIFA’s battered image. Sources say FIFA’s finance committee are aware of Emirates’ concerns. An Emirates spokesperson said: ‘We do not comment on rumours or speculation.’ FA performance chief Dave Reddin produced his 2003 Rugby World Cup winner’s medal to show the FA board before beginning his recent presentation about the way forward for the England team. However, the directors shouldn’t have been too impressed with the backroom staff gong because even the media man received one in Sydney before famously doing a jig on the podium. Reddin’s plan is to bring in an array of world-class sports scientists to produce key marginal gains. FA chairman Greg Dyke told council this was ‘not the cheapest option’. FA performance chief Dave Reddin is hoping to have a positive effect on the England national football team . The shambles of the FA not having a single representative from their doomed international committee in Croatia for the England Under 21 match, revealed by Sports Agenda, was raised in last week’s council meeting and described as a ‘disgrace’ by respected councillor Jack Pearce among others. The less-than-helpful reply to Pearce from David Gill, who now has overall command of the marginalised International Committee in his role as chairman of the Professional Game Board, was: ‘We can’t have the agenda of the FA being dictated by Charles Sale.’ Gill was also responsible for the bizarre decision to make Ivor Beeks, a vice-president of Wycombe Wanderers, a Premier League representative on the International Committee after he was kicked off by the Football League. The PL and FL remain flummoxed by Gill’s decision but getting a first-hand explanation is difficult because Gill usually only deigns to talk to the press when he has an election to win. Former Manchester United chief executive David Gill made a 'bizarre decision' in making Ivor Beeks a Premier League representative on the International Committee . Beeks, pictured on the far right sitting alongside Tony Adams, is vice-president of Wycombe Wanderers . Martin Slumbers, the investment banker chosen as the new R&A chief executive, has been such a low-key member of Worplesdon Golf Club in Surrey that a number of long-time regulars profess never to have seen him. The FIFA ethics commission’s ludicrous fuss over the return of the £16,400 Parmigiani watches gifted by Brazil’s football federation to World Cup delegates is put in perspective by Manchester United’s Tom Cleverley, now on loan at Aston Villa. He sold his personalised United sponsors Hublot No 23 watch to a Blackpool dealer, who is now asking £17,500 for it.","Hans-Joachim Eckert will release statement that will 'contain an overview of the investigation report' into the World Cup bidding process .

"Brutal: A youngster said to have been killed fighting on the frontline for the terror group . Hamid's son had been missing for a week, seized by Islamic State gunmen along with 148 other schoolchildren, when a friend discovered the fanatics had posted a contact number for distraught parents on the internet. He called the number and a militant put the terrified 13-year-old on the line. ‘He was really scared and crying so much,’ said Hamid. ‘I tried to calm him down and say it would be all right, but then I started crying too. I couldn’t help it.’ Seconds later, a jihadi leader took the phone and told the Kurdish car dealer that the seized pupils would only be let go if a group of captured IS fighters was freed. Hamid pleaded they were poor people without influence, begging him to spare their sons. ‘If they are not released within one week we will start killing your children, one by one,’ replied the callous terrorist leader. The teenage boys were not killed, however. Instead they were brainwashed, forced to watch horrific videos of beheadings and torture, then viciously beaten with cables if they failed to memorise Koranic verses or even if they drank water without permission. Their captors included many foreign extremists – among them a white British doctor in his late 30s who treated the boys after the most savage beatings. Many of the boys were finally freed last week after almost five months in captivity. But delight turned to dismay for their families when the boys started telling their fathers they would soon be slaughtered by jihadis and ordered ‘indecent’ mothers and sisters to cover their faces. ‘It was like they had been infected with a mental disease,’ said Hamid. ‘They were praying all the time, not talking to us and behaving so strangely.’ The saga of the 149 seized pupils, subjected to intensive mind control to convert them into militants, gives chilling new insight into the cruelties of the terror group that has seized large chunks of Iraq and Syria. Staking their claim: The sinister black flag of the Islamic State flies over the town of Kobane, Syria . The children were from Kobane, the key Syrian border town being besieged by IS. Their astonishing story emerged as I spoke to some of the 200,000 Kurds forced to flee their homes in the region. I stood by these refugees as they cheered from over the Turkish border while watching bombs dropped by US-led coalition aircraft flatten buildings flying the black flag of the jihadis. The thump of mortar shells and sounds of gunfire were clearly audible from street fighting in the town lying just across fields, as IS launched a fresh assault on the key Kurdish stronghold yesterday. Cars abandoned by fleeing families could be seen parked in panic on the border, while there are fears hundreds of trapped civilians face massacre. Local and international fury is growing over the inaction of Turkey, a Nato ally seeking to join the European Union. Some 16 tanks and armoured personnel carriers were on a hill nearby me; several had guns trained on their own towns, not Syria. Turkey led calls for action against Syrian President Bashar Assad – but its rulers fear Kurdish separatists more than the Islamist fanatics of IS. The country, home to 15 million Kurds, fought a secessionist insurgency for three decades until a ceasefire two years ago. Kurdish leaders accuse Turkey of supplying jihadis with weapons. ‘We have hundreds of youngsters who want to go and fight these people but Turkey will not let them cross the border,’ said Bakr Hadj Issa, a political activist from Kobane. More stories of murder and mayhem emerged yesterday. One man told me how IS thugs beheaded a well-known character with learning difficulties called Rashid, then drove around the streets dragging his body behind a car. ‘They do things like this to scare the population,’ said Farid Hinadi, a mechanic who witnessed the atrocity before escaping Kobane last week. Even amid such horrors, the brainwashing of schoolboys marks a terrible new twist in Syria’s nightmare. The story was confirmed by six families, most of whom asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. The children were captured at a checkpoint on May 29, as they were happily returning home in buses after 17 days of exams in Aleppo. Masked gunmen separated boys from girls, then took 149 Kurdish teenagers to a mosque in Minbij, an hour’s drive from Kobane. ‘They were very scary,’ said one 13-year-old. ‘There were many foreigners among them.’ The frightened boys were groomed with hours of lectures in radical Islam. They were told women should be covered up, that alcohol and music were forbidden, that earthly life was meaningless and killing disbelievers was the surest path to paradise. ‘They instructed us that jihad was an obligation and we would all be bought to justice before God on the day of judgment,’ said one 15-year-old. Every couple of days the boys were shown videos which became steadily more barbaric, with footage of beheadings, suicide operations and slaughtering of enemies. Chilling: The children were from Kobane, the key Syrian border town being besieged by IS, pictured above . Brainwashed: The frightened boys were told women should be covered up, that alcohol and music were forbidden and that killing disbelievers was the surest path to paradise. Above, ISIS militants in Syria . ‘They played emotional games to brainwash our boys to their cause, putting such heavy pressure on them,’ said one father, a market trader. ‘I have no doubt they wanted them to join their jihad.’ Slowly but surely, this intense indoctrination began to influence the boys. ‘I did not believe in it,’ a farmer’s son told me. ‘But after watching these videos, some of my friends said that when they left the prison they would return to join Daesh [the Arabic name for IS].’ The slightest infraction led to vicious beatings with cables on the boys’ backs or legs. One was left so badly wounded he could barely walk for ten days; another group was singled out for specially brutal violence lasting hours after other boys informed on escape plans. These teenagers were treated afterwards by a brown-haired European identified as ‘the British doctor’ by other militants. There were also several other guards from Europe. For the parents, the boys’ release ended an awful ordeal. ‘I was so sad, so scared and lost all hope,’ said Abu Azad, 54, whose 13 year-old son was badly beaten twice while held captive. But any joy was short-lived for many of the families, however, as they discovered how their lost children had been indoctrinated. ‘My son was praying all the time and talking about slaughtering people, which was very frightening,’ said one middle-class father. ‘He kept asking why we were not praying and was saying Daesh were coming to slaughter us. He was telling his mother and sisters to cover themselves up since they were indecent.’ After a week with his secular family, this studious 15-year-old had returned to his old self and he looked embarrassed when we discussed his brief burst of zealotry. Yet clearly some of the Kurdish teenagers remain militantly religious – with at least one intent on returning to join the fanatics. ‘Some of these children still pray regularly and remain influenced by their experiences and the religious teaching,’ a local teacher said. He speculated the aim was also to sow disunity among besieged Kurds in Kobane. But for 29 of these families, the hell continues as their sons, seized five months ago by the world’s most lethal terror group, remain captive.","IS seized 149 schoolchildren and subjected them to intensive mind control .

"Beyonce, Anne Hathaway and Gwyneth Paltrow swear by the raw vegan lifestyle for keeping their health in check and it seems the A-lister's way of life is catching on. Saskia Gregson-Williams, a professional ballerina and food blogger who lives in London, was left depressed for years suffering with chronic eczema until she learnt how to cure herself via diet. Speaking about her ailment, the 17-year-old said: 'I used to describe it as a snood of eczema, as it covered all around my neck and all over the rest of my body. I was never diagnosed with any allergies or given treatments that cured it, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.' Scroll down for video . Health kick: Saskia Gregson-Williams, a professional ballerina and food blogger at Naturally Sassy, was left depressed for years suffering with chronic eczema until she learnt how to cure it herself via diet and now she's shared her healthy recipes to help others . With no previous interest in nutrition, she decided to read up on foods that caused inflammation in the body, and found that dairy was one of the prime culprits. 'I took the radical decision to completely cut dairy out of my diet, and within a month my eczema had disappeared - it was amazing,' she said. 'My eczema had been really mentally weighing me down, it was so sore and inflamed and made me very insecure. The difference in my confidence, energy levels and happiness when it disappeared were really noticeable.' That was the first of a long list of changes that Saskia made to her diet and as a ballerina, who trains for eight hours a day, she realised she needed to start fuelling her body with the best possible nutrients. Peak physical condition: Saskia trains for eight hours every day in her job as a ballerina so says a healthy diet is extremely important when it comes to keeping her energy levels up . Finding alternatives: Saskia believes that meat, dairy, sugar and gluten are acidic and inflammatory to the body and left her feeling lethargic and bloated but she's found healthy versions of her favourite treats . Inspired by Kris Carr, who believes she cured her cancer via her diet and penned the best-seller Crazy Sexy Kris, Saskia became aware of the effect food really does have on your life. 'The more I learnt, the more passionate I became, and that’s when my culinary adventure really started,' she said. She embraced a vegan, gluten-free, sugar-free and wheat-free diet and set up her blog, Naturally Sassy, where she shares recipes and blogs her journey to a healthier lifestyle. 'The Naturally Sassy philosophy is all about embracing food the way nature made it - completely unrefined and unprocessed,' she said. High on health: Saskia believes that meat, dairy, sugar and gluten are acidic and inflammatory to the body but her new diet leaves her feeling energetic and full of life . 'In a nutshell, it is about cooking meals that are packed with nutrients and completely delicious. It is a simple way of eating that creates the flavours you love, naturally. It is not about depriving yourself and allows you to cook indulgent, healthy meals that taste incredible and make you feel great in body and mind.' Saskia believes that meat, dairy, sugar and gluten are acidic and inflammatory to the body and left her feeling lethargic and bloated. Since cutting them out, she says her mood,  energy levels, and wellbeing has sky-rocketed. 'This way of life took me from being down and depressed to utterly high on health,' she said. She starts the day with a smoothie bowl full of nuts and superfoods and has big batches of quinoa, lentils, roasted sweet potato wedges and hummus for lunch. For dinner she creates healthy versions of food so sweet potato and black bean burgers instead of beef burgers and vegetable risottos with a cashew-lemon cream rather than a dairy-based one. Saskia says that you can create delicious and healthy meals as long as you are creative and many of her recipes come with the disclaimer: 'This recipe may fill you with an abundance of energy, make you feel high on health, and cause effects of extreme happiness.'

"The wives of glam rock legend Alvin Stardust were joined in Swansea by hundreds of mourners, including a host of music legends, today to bid farewell to the star. Julie Paton and his first wife, Iris Fenton, along with some 350 people - including his former bandmates and his ex-manager Lord Levy - turned out at the singer's honorary Welsh home for the service at St Thomas church, the same church where he married Julie. After an emotional service, the singer's flower-laden coffin was showered with Champagne as his son thanked his rock star father for a 'lifetime' of 'Champagne moments'. In stirring scenes, 50 members of the Harley Davidson Owners' Club also escorted the singer's coffin from the funeral to Swansea Crematorium. Scroll down for video .

After an emotional service, the singer's flower-laden coffin was showered with Champagne as his son thanked his rock star father for a 'lifetime' of 'Champagne moments' The service was held at St Thomas church in his honorary Welsh home of Swansea - the same church where he married his beloved wife Julie Paton . His 44-year-old wife said it was her husband's dying wish that his funeral should be held at the church where they were married . Some 350 mourners turned out to pay their respects, while many lined the streets to watch the cortege makes its way to the church . The riders, who grew up listening to his music, came from as far afield as Bristol and Pembrokeshire at the request of his daughter Sophie. Stardust's bandmates also poured themselves a glass of whiskey around his coffin to toast the star, before a Champagne cork was popped to mark his habit of having a glass of bubbly at the end of a show. Stardust,  who grew up in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, died of prostate cancer last month, aged 72. The singer's coffin was carried into St Thomas' Church to one of Stardust's favourite songs When You Wish Upon A Star from the Disney film Pinocchio. Male voice choir the Gwalia Singers - who sang at the christening of the couple's daughter Millie, whose godfather is Sir Cliff Richard - also performed his favourite hymn Calon Lân. Lord Levy - who founded Magnet Records, which gave Stardust his stage name - then read a eulogy to the star, telling the congregation: 'I stand here as the creator of the persona of Alvin Stardust. 'But Alvin, you made yourself into such a great artist around the world.' The funeral cortege was led by vicar Steven Bunting (left) who was clutching an order of service picturing the singer (right) The hearse was escorted by members of a Harley Davidson bikers' club, who travelled from all over the country to take part .

Family members and friends of Alvin Stardust gathered after the service, including Lord Levy (right), his former manager . The former band members of Alvin Stardust, pictured, toasted the singer with a glass of whiskey . The performer's eldest son Shaun Fenton also paid tribute to his father who he said 'created champagne moments and lifetime memories again and again'. The singer - real name Bernard Jewry - started out in the music business in the 1960s but became a huge star on the back of the 1970s glam rock craze, scoring hits with tracks including My Coo Ca Choo and Jealous Mind. Stardust's career lasted five decades and he was still touring until shortly before his death. His retro rock 'n' roll sound, distinctive quiff, sideburns and eccentric outfits - often complete with a pair of black leather gloves - made him one of the most distinctive acts to grace the charts in the '70s. Stardust met his wife in the 1990s, when the singer was starring in the musical Godspell. Speaking before his funeral, Julie, 44, said: 'Alvin and I were married at St Thomas Church. 'It was Alvin's last wish that he be returned to the place where he felt his heart belonged, he considered himself an honorary Welshman and will wait there for his beloved wife to join him.' The couple bought a home in St Thomas soon after their wedding and stayed there to be with Julie's family when they were not touring. Born in London, Stardust grew up in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, and started playing guitar as a schoolboy. He met one of his biggest influences, Buddy Holly, at a gig in Doncaster and played backstage with the singer and his band the Crickets. The star married Port Talbot-born Julie Paton at St Thomas Church in October 1992 and requested his funeral be at the same church . Born Bernard Jewry, the entertainer (pictured holding his first acoustic guitar) is best remembered for hits including My Coo Ca Choo and Jealous Mind . Alvin, who had a career spanning five decades, is pictured with his wife Julie and daughter Millie at their home . He signed his first record deal in 1961 as the frontman of Shane Fenton And The Fentones but the band struggled to get in the charts despite regular touring in Europe and the UK. In 1973, he signed up with Magnet Records and took on the name that would make him famous - scoring hit after hit as Alvin Stardust. His success continued into the 1980s, with Pretend, I Feel Like Buddy Holly and I Won't Run Away all making the top 10. At the height of his fame in the mid-1970s, he appeared on TV as part of the Green Cross Code road safety campaign. Turning to acting, he appeared in a string of musicals including playing the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the London Palladium. He presented his own children's show, It's Stardust, on ITV and appeared in dramas including Hollyoaks and Doctors. After his death, several musicians and DJs came forward to pay their respects. Among those paying tribute was Radio 5 Live DJ presenter Nicky Campbell, who said: 'Pointing at the camera with his single leather glove. 'Lay down and groove on the mat'. He did the attitude consummately. Alvin Stardust RIP'. And Veteran DJ Tony Blackburn said: 'So sorry to hear about Alvin Stardust. He was a lovely man and gave us some great songs. RIP.' Lord Levy had said the death of the star was 'a sad day'. He said: 'He was one of the most professional artists that I had the privilege of working with. 'He was a real gentleman. Whenever he did TV or a radio appearance he would always thank the staff or the producer. He knew the score and knew what he was doing, he knew he had been given an opportunity and was prepared to graft to make the most of it. 'Whenever he did any promotional work anywhere in the world we always got the same reports that he was a gentleman and a pleasure to work with.'","Some 350 people attended the service at St Thomas Church, Swansea - the same church where he married his wife .

"Arsenal’s annual shareholders meeting becomes more frustrating by the year with the board now choosing which fans’ questions they answer, while deflecting the contentious issues. So Arsenal’s catering and cleaning contractors paying Emirates workers less than the hourly London living wage was a matter for the Government according to the club, who could easily deal only with companies which pay a London rate. And there was no detail about the exact advisory role carried out by owner Stan Kroenke’s company Kroenke Sport Entertainment, for which the club paid out over £3m. Meanwhile, the reasons given for Kroenke’s son Josh joining the board were his experience in leadership roles gained with various sports teams in the US — all owned by his father. And chairman Sir Chips Keswick didn’t count the number of shareholders who voted against Josh joining the board, though it looked remarkably close to the amount in favour. Josh Kroenke (far left) has joined Arsenal in an advisory role after working for clubs owned by his father . Sir Chips Keswick (right) has given Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger his full backing 'on all football matters' Finally Sir Chips brushed away a highly relevant question from respected horse racing figure Nigel Payne about Arsene Wenger not buying a defender in the summer. Grandee Keswick said the board gave the manager, who didn’t want to answer, 100 per cent backing on all football matters whether he had a plan or not. Owner Kroenke mumbled a few platitudes as well as saying the shareholders summit was an ‘unusual environment.’ There is increasing likelihood that the next Premier League TV rights tender — to be unveiled around the New Year — will include an extra eighth package to show Sunday night football, as revealed by Sports Agenda. And the slot, which already has the informal support of the top clubs —well aware that it could add at least another £600m to their coffers — could easily become the most valuable. There will be problems over transport and further diluting the Saturday afternoon programme but money always talks loudest in the Premier League. Sunday night Premier League matches could be shown on television in the near future . The Class of 92 have now become such a commercial entity that agency Wasserman Media Group, who represent Ryan Giggs and Gary and Phil Neville, are now acting for all five of the Manchester United group on some projects. Manchester United's Class of 92 stars including Ryan Giggs (far left) and Gary Neville are hot property . The MCC civil war over their botched rebuilding programme now sees various high-profile members including David Gower, Sir Ian Magee, Sir Simon Robertson, Sir David Metcalf and Lord Grabiner seeking support for another SGM to pass a vote of no confidence in chairman Oliver Stocken. But the grandees’ case is hardly helped by their other supporters, including members such as Paddy Briggs, who agitated for a previous costly SGM which he didn’t bother to attend. Clive Efford, Labour’s Shadow sports minister, is announcing his party’s proposal to enable at least two fans to be on every football club board and have the right to purchase up to 10 per cent of the shares when a club changes ownership. Efford says the fanciful policy — seriously over-hyped as the ‘biggest legislative shake-up in the governance of English and Welsh football clubs since the advent of the game’ — will form part of the election manifesto with legislation during the first term of a Labour Government. At least Efford is making a statement about his intentions for football in contrast to useless Minister for Sport Helen Grant, who has steered clear of football matters since a quiz ambush in which she couldn’t name the FA Cup holders. Minister for Sport Helen Grant did not know who the holders of the FA Cup were in November 2013 .

Fans flocked to Twitter to wish the legend well. Spinks and younger brother Michael both won Olympic gold medals in 1976 in different weight classes and went on to become heavyweight champions. Leon's rise was meteoric — he got a shot at Ali and the heavyweight title on Feb. 15, 1978, after just seven pro fights. Few in boxing — including Ali — gave Spinks any chance in the fight, but he used his energy and awkward style to frustrate Ali and win a 15-round split decision at the Las Vegas Hilton. But he lost the title back to Ali in their rematch seven months later before more than 60,000 people at the Superdome in New Orleans. 'Ali thought I was a wimp and I had to prove to him I wasn't,' Spinks said recently. 'I knew I could beat him after watching his fights.' Spinks would get one more chance at the title in 1981 against Larry Holmes, only to be stopped in the third round. He would never become the heavyweight champion again but fought until 1995, finishing with a career mark of 26-17-3. Leon's rise was meteoric — he got a shot at Ali and the heavyweight title on Feb. 15, 1978, after just seven pro fights . Spinks was known to mix partying with training, and quickly burned through the big money he made early in his career. He would later move to Nebraska, where he worked as a custodian at a YMCA before moving to Las Vegas in 2011. Spinks, who has slurred his words since his active boxing days, was diagnosed in 2012 with shrinkage in his brain, which doctors said was likely caused by the punches he took during his career. 'My brain has got to let me know I'm doing all right and I've got to do things to help my brain now,' Spinks said after the diagnosis. Michael Spinks upset Holmes for the heavyweight title in 1985 and fought Mike Tyson in a title showdown three years later. Tyson knocked him out 91 seconds into the fight, and he retired. Fans flocked to Twitter to wish the legend well. 'Prayers for #LeonSpinks please!' wrote Paul Shortino. 'Hope Leon Spinks pulls through,' tweeted user Hands of Stone.
