"As many as ten cats have been discovered dead or dying on the same street after apparently being poisoned, sparking fears from neighbours that a pet killer is on the loose. RSPCA officers have launched an investigation after a number of cats were discovered with similar symptoms, consistent with poisoning, in the residential street in Norwich. Neighbours have described the cats as suffering from severe stomach upsets and frothing vomit, and worry that the animals have been deliberately poisoned. Tracy Marrison, pictured with her son Jake, is one of several neighbours in Norwich who fear their pet cats have been poisoned . Miss Marrison's pet cat Pilchard (left) was found dead, while her neighbour Leanne Dye believes her pet cats Daisy (right) and Shadow were poisoned . Tracy Marrison had at first thought that her pet cat Pilchard, which she and partner Daniel Graves had bought for their son Jake, had suffered a stroke due to old age. But then two cats belonging to her neighbour Leanne Dye were found dead on the same day, having also been foaming at the mouth. 'He was like my oldest boy’s best friend,' she told the Eastern Daily Press. 'He is devastated. For anyone to do that to someone’s family pet, it’s cruel and wicked.' Mrs Dye said that her black and white cat Daisy and a tabby called Shadow were both found dead on January 13. 'My neighbour found one of my cats dead in her greenhouse and she came to let me know,' she said. 'I called for the other one but she didn't show up and we found her body in the shed later that same day. Leo Davies, five,  with his family cat Bruce - who had to be put to sleep after was found having seizures and foaming at the mouth . 'Shadow and Daisy were both found with their eyes open and foaming at the mouth surrounded by faeces. 'It was devastating.' The mother-of-four added: 'One of our neighbours found their new kitten in the same state. 'It was still barely alive so they took it to the vet and it had to be put to sleep. 'I'd had Daisy for nearly eight years and Shadow was her daughter. 'It's been so upsetting - my four kids are devastated.' Another black and white elderly male cat called Pilchards also died after being struck down. While horrified Zoe Davies found her 11-month-old kitten Bruce having seizures and foaming at the mouth on January 23. He had to be taken to the vets and put to sleep - to the distress of Mrs Davies's five-year-old son Leo. RSPCA officers have been told that as many as ten cats in this single street have been poisoned . Another stray cat which had been adopted by one neighbour was found dead on his doorstep. Owners say they have had to pay around £200 vet bills as they deal with the loss of their pets. Vets told some families that their cats may be been poisoned by anti-freeze. RSPCA inspector Ben Kirby called on owners to contact their vet if there were any signs of poisoning, such as: . * depression . * lack of appetite . * vomiting . * diarrhoea . * breathing difficulties . * appearing drunk and uncoordinated . * twitching . * seizures . The RSPCA has been told that as many as ten cats have died in the same street. RSPCA inspector Ben Kirby said: 'This is highly distressing and we urge anyone with any information about this to call us. 'It is difficult to know for sure what happened and how these poor cats were poisoned. 'But it's extremely concerning that so many animals died in this horrible way in such a short space of time in just one street. 'Poisoning causes a lot of pain and distress and is often fatal. 'It is likely all these cats suffered a lot before they died.' Mr Kirby warned that anyone who poisoned an animal could get a £20,000 fine and/or six months in prison under the Animal Welfare Act. 'We do not know for sure what the cause of the poisonings was,' he said. 'But we'd urge people to be careful when using poisonous substances - to clear up any spills and to store and discard them safely. 'There is also the worrying possibility that someone did this deliberately so if anyone has seen anything suspicious please contact us.' Police told MailOnline that officers were aware of the poisoning complaints, but as yet had no evidence to suggest what might have led to the cats' deaths.","Cats in same Norwich street showed symptoms consistent with poisoning .

"Foreign Minister Julie Bishop will not mount a leadership challenge against Tony Abbott, quieting speculation she was counting numbers to unseat the Prime Minister. Ms Bishop made a definitive statement to Cabinet on Tuesday afternoon after reports surfaced that she had refused to give an assurance to Mr Abbott that she would not run against him in a spill for the Coalition leadership. 'I am not campaigning for the job of Prime Minister, I will not challenge the leader,' she told Cabinet, Sky News reports. 'I am not ringing the backbench asking for support, I'm not counting numbers.' Scroll down for video . No challenge: Tony Abbott met with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Sunday afternoon and asked her not to run against him for leadership of the Liberal party . Tony Abbott refused on Tuesday to confirm if he met with the Foreign Minister to ask her not to mount a challenge . Mr Abbott has been under heavy fire since announcing his decision on Australia Day to knight Prince Philip and reports that he met with Ms Bishop on Sunday seek a guarantee that he enjoyed her full support. Treasurer Joe Hockey told reporters after leaving the meeting to address the RBA interest rate cut: 'I have no doubt at all that Julie Bishop is absolutely 100 per cent supportive of the Prime Minister.' It comes after Mr Abbott was ambushed by TV host Leigh Sales after she stepped out of the studio to question him at a childcare centre. Tony Abbott was visiting the Little Pines Centre in Sydney with his wife Margie on Tuesday when he was ambushed by ABC 7.30 host Leigh Sales over leadership speculation . In the fiery exchange, veteran journalist Sales asked Mr Abbott if he would 'bring on a spill' to put an end to speculation about the Liberal leadership . The Prime Minister refused to answer when Sales asked him if he had sought assurance from Ms Bishop that she wouldn't challenge him. 'Look, Julie and I have lots of talks, as you’d expect. We're friends, we're colleagues, we’re part of the leadership team and we support each other,' he said. In the fiery exchange, Sales asked Mr Abbott if he would 'bring on a spill' to put an end to speculation about the Liberal leadership. 'You're the speculator, Leigh, not me,' Mr Abbott hit back. Sales pushed Mr Abbott saying 'I assure you that a lot of people on the backbench are speculating as well, Prime Minister.' 'Leigh, the thing is that we were elected because people were sick of chaos. That’s why we were elected – people were sick of chaos,' Mr Abbott said. 'And what I am determined to do is give Australia back the certainty and stability that people crave. People want a government which is focused on doing the right thing by them, not focused on itself.' Sales poked fun at his repeated attempts to dodge the tough questions when she tweeted a photo of Mr Abbott playing with children at the Little Pines Centre with his wife Margie. 'The PM @tonyabbottmhr taking a few tricky questions from the punters,' the caption read. The ABC told Daily Mail Australia that Sales liked to get out of the studio as much as possible and went to press conferences from time to time. Mr Abbott and his wife Margie visited the childcare with local member Craig Laundy to talk about the government's jobs and families package . Ms Bishop says she is not counting numbers and his not calling backbenchers . The press conference was streamed live on the ABC and some took to social media to comment on Leigh Sales' showing up to question Mr Abbott . The ABC said Sales liked to get out of the studio as much as possible and went to press conferences from time to time . Mr Abbott also refused to deny reports he met with Ms Bishop and asked her not to mount a challenge when he appeared on Channel Seven's Sunrise on Tuesday morning. 'I think people find all that insider Canberra stuff boring,' he told Channel Seven's Sunrise. 'I have meetings with Julie Bishop all the time.' When asked repeatedly if he asked Ms Bishop not to challenge, Mr Abbott said: 'I'm not going to play these Canberra insider games'. 'What (people) are looking for is politicians who are not endlessly navel gazing, not fighting amongst themselves, but are getting on with the government of this country,' he said. Ms Bishop reportedly refused  the commitment because she was angered by news reports at the weekend that she had told Mr Abbott she wouldn't challenge. Julie Bishop, NSW Premier Mike Baird (left) and the United Kingdom's Secretary of State Philip Hammond (right) signed the Lindt cafe condolence book on Monday following the Sydney siege . Ms Bishop and United Kingdom's Secretary of State Philip Hammond signed the siege condolence book at Martin Place for the victim's of the Sydney siege . Treasurer Joe Hockey dismissed reports Ms Bishop declined to give  a commitment. 'Unsourced gossip,' he said when asked about the Sky News report on Channel Nine's Today show. It comes as Mr Abbott made it clear during a major speech in Canberra on Monday that he would not give up the top job amid speculation of a leadership challenge. 'We were elected in 2013 because the Australian people rejected chaos,' he said. 'It's the people that hire and frankly it's the people that should fire.' The Prime Minister has been shaken by various blows in recent weeks, including the Liberal National Party loss at the Queensland state election at the weekend. Mr Abbott said of Ms Bishop: 'She's a friend of mine, Julie's my deputy, she's been a terrific deputy, been a terrific minister, I believe I have her full support.' Treasurer Joe Hockey dismissed reports Ms Bishop declined to give a commitment . Mr Abbott was also widely criticised for knighting Prince Philip on Australia Day. With leadership speculation rife in recent days, Mr Abbott warned on Monday that his government must not repeat the mistakes of the past as he dumped his Paid Parental Leave scheme. 'The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years cannot become the new normal lest Australia join the weak government club and become a second rate country living off its luck,' he said. 'I never came into politics to be popular.' He also made mention of Ms Bishop saying: 'She's a friend of mine, Julie's my deputy, she's been a terrific deputy, been a terrific minister, I believe I have her full support.'","Julie Bishop rules out leadership challenge against Tony Abbott .

"The deaths of two law students in  an apparent murder-suicide has stunned their  classmates, who never expected the couple's tragic end. Wajih Mazloum, 28, and his girlfriend Sara LaMont, 25, were found dead in their apartment near Tulane University in New Orleans, where both were in their second year of law school. Investigators believe that Mr Mazloum shot Ms LaMont before turning the gun on himself. Wajih Mazloum, 28, and Sara LaMont, 25, were found dead Sunday morning after an apparent murder-suicide near Tulane University . Their bodies were found Sunday morning by the couple's roommate, along with a handgun near the suspected shooter. The university released a statement saying it is mourning the loss of the boyfriend and girlfriend, who were from Rhode Island and New Jersey respectively and had lived together since last year. Neighbors said that they did not notice or hear the couple fighting and that Mr Mazloum never acted aggressively towards Ms LaMont. They were most well known for sitting on their porch balcony, smoking cigarettes and keeping an eye on the happenings of their block. Friends and professors of Ms LaMont said that the young woman, who was planning on going into sports law, was 'enormously talented' and one of the sharpest at the school. Students at Tulane Law School made a memorial for the couple, who were described as smart with bright futures . The student previously worked with the New Jersey Nets and the New York Yankee affiliate Trenton Thunder before entering law school. She served on the Tulane Law Review, which required outstanding academic achievement, according to the New Orleans Advocate, and the school's Student Bar Association described her as 'brilliant'. Law school dean David Meyer said that both students had bright futures ahead of them, making the incident 'inexplicable'. Mr Mazloum, who worked with disadvantaged youth, was also described as 'positive and upbeat'. The couple had lived together in their New Orleans apartment (above) since last year and neighbors had never heard them fight or act aggressively . He had previously worked in finance and was a student attorney at Tulane's environmental law clinic. The student was known to have a love of gummy bears. However one friend said he wondered when he heard about the student's purchase of a firearm at a recent gun show but was not too worried, according to The Times-Picayune. There will be no record of Mr Mazloum's buying the weapon if he did in fact by it at a gun show, according to firearms authorities. Students placed flowers at a memorial outside the law school on Monday to remember their classmates. The Tulane community has suffered from seven untimely deaths so far this academic year, four of which were suicides. University president Michael Fitts said it had been an 'extraordinarily difficult year'.","Wajih Mazloum, 28, and Sara Lamont, 25, found in New Orleans apartment .

"John O'Brien, 53, died in September last year after cannabis triggered a massive drop in blood pressure that proved deadly . A man died after suffering heart problems as a result of a decade-long addiction to  cannabis, an inquest heard. John O'Brien, 53, from Salford, began smoking cannabis to cope with life-changing brain injuries sustained in a car crash. But over a ten-year period, the Class B drug took its toll on his body and caused his heart to stop working. A coroner at Bolton Coroner's Court ruled in December 2014 that Mr O'Brien died from cannabis cardiotoxicity, a little known condition in which smoking cannabis triggers heart problems. In Mr O'Brien's case, smoking marijuana caused a massive drop in blood pressure which  proved deadly. His relatives have now issued an urgent warning to others, urging them to be wary of the dangers of smoking the drug. His twin brother Mark, 54, a builder who also lives in Swinton, Salford, said Mr O'Brien began taking the drug to cope with the pain of losing his job and relationship in the accident which left him with personality changes and unable to work. He was travelling in the back of a friend's car not wearing a seatbelt when he was catapulted forward, hitting his head on the seat in front of him. Signed off disabled, Mr O'Brien developed a £25-a-week cannabis habit, smoking around three or four joints a day. He was found lifeless at home on 30th September 2014 by his former partner, who had remained his carer since the accident in 1988. Because he collapsed partially upright against a sofa, it is thought the cannabis cardiotoxicity starved his brain of blood, leading to his death. Mr O'Brien's family say people have been stunned that cannabis killed him – and want to speak out to warn others. Mark O'Brien said: 'Obviously we knew drugs were bad for him but we didn't think they would kill him. 'He said he'd smoke to forget all the things he'd lost as a result of the car accident. 'We'd always be on at him to give up cannabis and he said he was trying to get off it and was on a cannabis substitute. 'The tragedy was a few weeks before his death he'd joined a gym and really cut down on it.' Research into the effects of cannabis on the cardiovascular system is still only beginning - but one study found middle-aged men are most likely to be seriously affected. Evidence was also found that marijuana may trigger pre-existing heart conditions that users were previously unaware of. Cannabis cardiotoxicity is a little-known condition in which smoking cannabis triggers heart problems. In Mr O’Brien’s case, a ten year addiction stopped his heart from working, and he suffered a deadly drop in blood pressure. Dr Benno Hartung, from the University of Dusseldorf, Germany, wrote a paper in February last year on two healthy men who unexpectedly died as a result of cannabis cardiotoxicity. Writing in the journal Forensic Science International, Dr Hartung said the risk of a heart attack is elevated almost five-fold in the hour after smoking cannabis. Cannabis smoking can cause an increase in heart rate that leads to the muscle becoming blocked in individuals susceptible to this, and they can suffer heart failure, he said. ‘Persons who are at high risk for cardiovascular diseases are  recommended to avoid the use of cannabis,’ Dr Hartung concluded. Mark O'Brien said: 'When we tell people he died due to cannabis they just don't believe it. 'If we can stop one more person from smoking cannabis it will be worth it.' Commenting on Mr O'Brien's death, David Raynes, a spokesman for the National Drug Prevention Alliance, told MailOnline: ‘German researchers have found how cannabis affects the heart. 'What is said is that cannabis triggers heart problems that can kill some people. 'Death from cannabis cardiotoxicity is rare but it does happen. 'We’re told cannabis is harmless but it’s not. 'People aren’t aware of this danger. It’s not widely re-publicised. 'These are small amounts of cannabis, which makes it even more worrying. 'There are a lot of people campaigning for legalisation who say it's harmless, but it’s just not true.’ The news comes after MailOnline reported how a mother-of-three from Bournemouth who was the first woman in Britain to die form cannabis poisoning. Gemma Moss, 31, died after she was poisoned by the cannabis she smoked to help her get to sleep. She had previously smoked half a joint a night to help her doze off, but had stopped for two years before she died, taking up smoking again before her death to help beat insomnia. An inquest in January 2014 ruled her death was caused by cannabis toxicity, and a coroner recorded a verdict of death by cannabis abuse. Meanwhile a case report published in the journal Forensic Science International in February 2014 described the cases of two healthy men who died unexpectedly under the influence of cannabis. Lead author Dr Benno Hartung, from the University of Dusseldorf, Germany, said a full range of postmortem tests corroborated the conclusion that the men died from cannabis cardiotoxicity. Mr O'Brien's brother Mark has spoken out about the dangers of the drug, which his brother had smoked daily for ten years. 'If we can stop one more person from smoking cannabis it will be worth it,' he said. In December 2014 a coroner ruled that Mr O'Brien died as a result of heart problems triggers by a misuse of cannabis. He had been smoking £25 a week to cope after a car crash ten years ago left him disabled and he lost his job and relationship . They had a marked increase in heart rate that might have led to blood flow to the heart being blocked in individuals susceptible to this. Writing in the paper, he said the assumption was the men died due to heart rhythm problems evoked by smoking cannabis, although they did not rule out that other factors may have predisposed them to heart problems. The risk of a heart attack increases five-fold in the hour after smoking cannabis, he said. He concluded: 'People who are at high risk for cardiovascular diseases are recommended to avoid the use of cannabis.' Rosanna O’Connor, director of the Alcohol, Drugs and Tobacco Division at Public Health England said: 'Based on evidence from across Europe, we know that stronger strains of cannabis may well be causing more problems. 'Our figures show that more and more people are using specialist drug services to get help for cannabis use, even though the overall trend is falling. 'This increase is likely to be due to a greater awareness of the risks and problems caused by cannabis by both people using the drug and health professionals referring people on to services.'","John O'Brien, 53, died in September 2014 from 'cannabis cardiotoxicity'

"Ever since his aging Honda Accord broke down a decade ago and he couldn't afford a replacement, 56-year-old James Robertson has been making 21 miles of his daily commute to his factory job on foot. But not being able to afford a vehicle isn't a problem any more - after $230,000 of donations poured in to an online fund to get him a new ride. Americans touched by images of Robertson battling through the snow on his daily reached for their wallets to help out the dedicated worker, whose intimidating commute never stops him making it in for his $10.55-an-hour wage. Scroll down for video . Trudging on: James Robertson, 56, walks 21 miles a day to get to his $10.55-an-hour factory job in Detroit, Michigan . Helping out: Robertson, who is now the recipient of a $230,000 pot on the GoFundMe website, is pictured above with college student Evan Leedy, who started the project . All he wants: The modest Ford Taurus, above, is the car Robertson has said he'd most like to spend his money on . Robertson, who lives 23 miles from his job, and has worked 2pm-10pm shift for the past 12 years, never missing a shift. As only part of his journey is covered by bus routes, he puts in 21 of the 46-miles round trip on foot. He walks eight on his way in way in, while on the way home he faces a 13-mile trek, since some services have finished. However, the punishing, all-weather hikes now look like a thing of the past for Robertson, whose surging total on a GoFundMe donations page passed $230,000 Tuesday evening. That amount of cash in the bank could get Roberston some of the flashiest motors on the market - including a convertible Aston Martin V8 Vantage (around $138,000), a Maserati Granturismo ($132,000), or, at a push, a Lamborghini Gallardo (from $181,000). Rain or shine: Robertson has a perfect attendance record at work, and has battled heat, rain and cold alike to make it on time for the past 12 years . Tough life: Robertson takes a bus for just over half of his 46-mile-a-day trek, but still puts in almost half on foot . But the machine operator, who said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that American manufacturers are more his style, has said all he wants is a Ford Taurus, which will set him back some $27,000. He said: 'I'm a Ford fan. I remember the Taurus. They look comfortable, nothing fancy. They're simple on the outside, strong on the inside — like me'. 'I'm 6-foot and I think the Mustang's a little tight,... I mostly stay with Americans cars - Lincoln, Fords, GM, Dodge.' The fundraising campaign for Robertson was started by Evan Leedy, 19-year-old college junior who read his story and decided to raise money for him - initially with a $5,000 goal. Over just two days, 6,750 people have donated, with individual contributions as high as $2,000. Moment of rest: In the above photo, Robertson stops to pray during a break at the factory in the Detroit suburb of Rochester Hills where he works . Leedy and Robertson met Monday night at a bar in Rochester, Michigan, ahead of a round of national press interviews. At the encounter, Robertson said: 'I'm always going to be in your debt — I will never forget this.' The teen responded by showing him some comments left alongside the donations - many of which said that he deserved the money for his decades of hard work. Although the fund was originally just meant to get Roberston - whose last ride was a decrepit Honda which gave up in 2005 - a new set of wheels, the fund could now do much more. As well as the car itself - which some local dealers have offered to give to him for nothing - the cash is likely to help with medical and dental expenses, as well as longer-term commuting expenses like gas, repairs and insurance. The interviews and meeting were orchestrated by Blake Pollock, a UBS banker who saw Robertson's commute, sometimes gave him lifts, and first told the press about him. The finance expert has now assembled a group of advisers to manage the ever-growing fund, which is now 17,500 times larger than his annual wage - or equivalent to eight and a half years' work. BREAKING THE BANK: LAMBORGHINI GALLARDO ($181,000) Should Robertson want to spend most his $230,000 windfall at once, he could just about nose his way into the elite ranks of Lamborghini owners. The entry-level Gallardo (below) sells for just over $180,000, leaving a little spare cash for gas. A TOUCH OF BRITISH CLASS: ASTON MARTIN V8 VANTAGE ($138,000) If style is more of a concern for Robertson than out-and-out cost, the British-made Aston Martin V8 Vantage, the slightly more affordable cousin on Bond cars like the DB10, sells for just shy of $140,000. ALL-AMERICAN: THE DODGE VIPER . While not quite the range-topping ride which his budget allows for, the Viper (below), does have the advantage of coming from one of Robertson favorite manufacturers - Dodge. It could be his for as little as $85,000. 'SIMPLE AND STRONG', THE UNLIKELY FRONTRUNNER: FORD TAURUS ($27,000) Despite the sizable fund now on offer, Robertson said that he only wants a modest car - and is seemingly set on a Ford Taurus, shown below at a 2011 motor show in New York.","James Robertson, 56, has been walking to work in Detroit since 2005 .

After searching the library, responding officers found Timothy Lee Anderson on the second floor . Police say at that point, the 27-year-old junior philosophy major turned the firearm on himself and committed suicide. A portion of the campus was evacuated and a text message went out at 5.15pm via MSU's emergency alert system informing the community of the deadly incident. No one else was injured, and police say there was no danger to the public, reported Manktao Times. Off limits: The library reopened early Monday evening, but the second floor remained blocked off . MSU Student Titi Kawonise, who was working on the second floor of the library Monday afternoon, described to the local paper the moment Anderson was tackled by police, followed by the sound of a gunshot.

"A mother whose toddler son was mauled to death by her babysitter’s dogs has told how she has forgiven her - because she 'doesn’t want to lose a friend as well as a son'. Daxton Borchardt was 14 months old when he was killed by Susan Iwicki’s pet pitbulls, Penny and Boss, while she was looking after him while his parents Kim and Jeff, from East Troy, Wisconsin, went out. The toddler, affectionately known as Dax, was in 30-year-old Miss Iwicki’s arms when the animals viciously leapt up and dragged him down on to the floor, attacking him. Kim Borchardt, left, lost her son at the hands of her friend and babysitter, right, Susan Iwicki's pet pitbulls. She has forgiven her because she doesn't want to lose her son and friend . Dax was fatally injured. Covered in blood, he was raced to hospital, but died three hours later. Miss Iwicki was also hurt trying to fight off the dogs. At first, Jeff and Kim said they hated Miss Iwicki, who was not charged with any offences over the incident in March 2013. Mrs Borchardt described how she felt when she learnt her son was dead. 'In that moment I hated Susan and hated her dogs,' the 39-year-old said. 'I screamed at her, ""Why was Dax near them? How did they get to him?"" . 'Afterwards, the days, weeks and months passed in a sad blur. Susan sent a card which I looked at, but I didn’t contact her. She didn’t come to his funeral, which was packed.' Daxton, affectionately known as Dax, was in Miss Iwicki's arms when the animals attacked . Parents Jeff and Kim, pictured with Dax, hated Miss Iwicki, who was not charged with any offences . Susan kept Boss and Penny, pictured, away from Dax because Jeff had asked her to but recalling the incident, Susan explained how one dog stood on her throat so she couldn't reach Dax . Before the incident, the Borchardts and Miss Iwicki had been close. After Dax was born in December 2011, Miss Iwicki regularly babysat. 'Susan was totally smitten with him,' she recalled. 'Dax was your typical little boy. He was interested in absolutely everything and always up to mischief. When he learnt to walk at ten months you couldn’t leave him alone for a minute. He loved pulling things off shelves and clambering over to bookcases. 'I knew I was biased because I was his mum, but Dax was a real looker. He had huge eyes, a cheeky grin and fluffy dark hair.' Mrs Borchardt worked in a suburb of Milwaukee, and Mr Borchardt worked as a DJ at night and helped Miss Iwicki’s boyfriend lay carpets in the day, so Dax was looked after by Miss Iwicki. 'He loved it there,' Mrs Borchardt recalled. 'She had two little chinchillas, Poe and Raven, and Dax adored them. He would stare at them for hours. But I knew she kept Boss and Penny away from Dax because Jeff had asked her to. I knew she looked after the dogs but Dax was so little and they were so big.' Dax, pictured with his dad Jeff, is described as 'your typical little boy ... always up to mischief' Mrs Borchardt recalled the last time she saw her son alive. 'On March 5, 2013, when Dax was 14 months, he fell asleep while eating his evening meal,' she said. 'Laughing at how silly he looked face down in his tea, I thought about how much I loved him. 'The next day I got up extra early because it was really snowy and I wanted to take the drive to work slowly.' Mr Borchardt dropped their son off at Miss Iwicki and  went to work. Shortly afterwards Dax was attacked by the dogs and flown by air ambulance to Milwaukee Children’s Hospital. Mrs Borchardt continued: 'I’d been at work as an accountant a few hours when I got a call from the police. They said he’d been bitten by a dog. I wasn’t sure how it had happened because the chinchillas were harmless and the big dogs weren’t supposed to be anywhere near him.' She met her husband at the hospital and learnt what had happened. 'The doctors told me it wasn’t good news and led me to a quiet room,' she said. 'When the doctors said they’d lost him I was shell-shocked, I didn’t speak. I went to see him and whispered ""I love you, I’m so sorry I wasn’t there for you"".' Mrs Borchardt recalled the last time she saw her son alive. 'On March 5, 2013, when Dax was 14 months, he fell asleep while eating his evening meal, I thought about how much I loved him,' she said . Dax's mother explained that when he learnt to walk at ten months she couldn't leave him alone for a minute. 'He loved pulling things off shelves and clambering over to bookcases,' she said of the toddler . Jeff, pictured with Dax, has asked Susan to keep the big dogs away from Dax . But it was months before she started to forgive Miss Iwicki – and after the anniversary of Dax’s death before she was able to see her again. She said: 'We both began to realise that she had not intended for Dax to be killed, had not realised how dangerous her dogs could be. 'So we invited her to be part of Daxton’s Friends, a charity we were launching to educate people about pitbulls. People asked if I would be OK but I was adamant. I needed to see her so she knew it was OK. 'I knew it wouldn’t change how I felt about Dax. Even so looking at her for the first time wasn’t easy when she came to our first meeting. When we first saw each other we hugged and she said she was sorry. Now we are working together to encourage proper pet care and reduce the number of dog-related incidents. 'Losing Dax was the worst thing that could have happened to me. I won’t lose my friend as well as my son,' she said. Speaking after the incident, Susan, pictured left, said: 'I began to think that maybe this wasn't the case and that perhaps pitbulls shouldn’t be kept as pets' Miss Iwicki, 32, of Fontana, Wisconsin, said: 'The dogs were allowed in the house but never when Dax was there. Although they had never been violent, they were strong dogs, could knock him over. I wouldn’t have wanted that to happen.' Recounting the day of his death, she said: 'One dog stood on my throat so I couldn’t reach Dax. There was blood everywhere. 'I spoke to the police and they cleared me of any blame, but I blamed myself. I didn’t blame Kim and Jeff for blaming me. My dogs, who I agreed should be put down, had killed their son. I’d cared for Boss and Penny and always believed that dangerous dogs were the fault of the owner. 'But I began to think that maybe this wasn’t the case and that perhaps pitbulls shouldn’t be kept as pets.' Describing the first time she saw Mrs Borchardt, she said: 'Losing Dax has left a huge gap in our lives. We aren’t the same people we were. But thanks to the power of friendship and a shared aim we’ve overcome terrible tragedy and are friends again.' Kim and her husband invited Susan to be part of Daxton's Friends, a charity they were launching to educate people about pitbulls . Fatal pit bull attacks involving children and adults alike have been on the rise in recent years. In 2011, seven children five years old and younger were mauled to death by dogs of that breed nationwide, along with 15 adults. In 2012, a total of 23 Americans were killed by pit bulls, including nine children, the youngest of them, Makayala Darnell, was only three days old. Of all the fatalities that year, 34 per cent involved more than one dog. So far this year, at least four people were killed by dogs, all of them pit bulls. Among the most recent victims were four-year-old Christian Gormanous, age four, and Isaiah Aguilar, age two, both from Texas. In the eight-year period from 2005 to 2012, pit bulls and Rottweilers, the second most lethal breed, accounted for 73 per cent of the total 251 recorded deaths. Pit bulls make up less than 5 per cent of the total US dog population. Source: Dogsbite.org .","Daxton Borchardt was 18 months old when he was killed .

"Scroll down for video . Think you're doing your body a favor with a daily herbal supplement? Think again: an astonishing 4 out of 5 herbal pills at four major retailers in New York State are contaminated or outright replaced by a potentially dangerous range of fillers from rice to powdered houseplants. The worrying findings were announced Tuesday as part of an investigation into numerous store brand supplements that aren't filled with what their labels claim, an ongoing investigation using DNA testing has found. GNC, Target, Walmart and Walgreen Co. sold supplements that either couldn't be verified to contain the labeled substance or that contained ingredients not listed on the label, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office said. Buyer beware: GNC is among a handful of national retailers whose store-brand herbal supplements were found by a New York State agency to have potentially dangerous contaminants--with some testing negative for any of the herb they're purported to contain . Shocking: Overall, only 21 percent of the test results from store brand herbal supplements contained DNA from the plants listed on the labels . Overall, only 21 percent of the test results from store brand herbal supplements contained DNA from the plants listed on the labels. The retailer with the poorest showing was Walmart, where 4 percent of the products tested showed DNA from the plants listed on the labels. 'This investigation makes one thing abundantly clear: The old adage 'buyer beware' may be especially true for consumers of herbal supplements,' Schneiderman said. Schneiderman asked the companies to provide detailed information on production, processing, testing and quality control for herbal supplements sold at their stores. Walmart spokesman Brian Nick said the company is immediately reaching out to suppliers and will take appropriate action. Walgreen and GNC pledged to cooperate with the attorney general. 'We take these issues very seriously and as a precautionary measure, we are in the process of removing these products from our shelves as we review this matter further,' Walgreen spokesman James Graham said. Target didn't initially respond to a request for comment. 'We stand by the quality, purity and potency of all ingredients listed on the labels of our private label products,' said GNC spokeswoman Laura Brophy. The investigation looked at six herbal supplements sold at stores across the state. Testing was performed by an expert in DNA barcoding technology, James Schulte II of Clarkson University in Potsdam. The DNA tests were performed on three to four samples of each of the supplements purchased. Each sample was tested five times. Overall, 390 tests involving 78 samples were performed. Steve Mister, president and CEO of the dietary supplement trade group the Council for Responsible Nutrition, on Tuesday criticized the testing procedure and Schneiderman, who he accused of engaging in a 'self-serving publicity stunt under the guise of protecting public health.' He said the companies should have been given a greater opportunity to respond before Schneiderman went public and 'processing during manufacturing of botanical supplements can remove or damage DNA; therefore while a DNA testing method can be useful in some cases, this method well may be the wrong test for these kinds of products.' The retailer with the poorest showing was Walmart, where 4 percent of the products tested showed DNA from the plants listed on the labels . Michael McGuffin, president of the American Herbal Products Association, which represents the herbal industry, called DNA testing 'an emerging technology that has the potential to be useful in the future when it has been rigorously tested and validated.' He said identification of an herb through DNA testing must be confirmed with established analytical tools that herbal experts use, such as chromatography or microscopy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires companies to verify their products are safe and properly labeled. But supplements aren't subjected to the rigorous evaluation process used for drugs. If a manufacturer fails to identify all the ingredients on an herbal product's label, a consumer with allergies or who is taking medication for an unrelated illness could risk serious health issues every time a contaminated herbal supplement is ingested. A DNA study conducted by the University of Guelph in 2013 also found contamination and substitution in herbal products in most of the products tested. One product labeled as St. John's wort, often used to treat depression, contained Senna alexandrina, a plant with laxative properties. One ginkgo product was contaminated with black walnut, which could endanger people with nut allergies. A 2013 study from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research estimated there are about 65,000 dietary supplements on the market consumed by more than 150 million Americans.","Authorities identified the bogus supplements sold at GNC, Target, Walgreens and Walmart stores across New York State .

"Comic Al Murray is standing against Nigel Farage in Thanet South, Kent . TV comic Al Murray took a leaf out of the election book of political rival Nigel Farage today – by making his first campaign stop in a pub. The Oxford-educated stand-up, who is standing for Parliament against the Ukip leader in his guise as The Pub Landlord, hit to the campaign trail for the first time. The star - whose creation is famed for extolling the joys of all things British - is standing in South Thanet for his newly-formed Free United Kingdom Party. He launched his bid to win over voters by kissing the ground after arriving in Kent this morning. He travelled by train to the seaside towns of Margate, Broadstairs and Ramsgate in Kent. Arriving at Margate railway station, he fired off his first gag in character, tweeting: 'Just arrived in Margate. Great to be back in Essex.' He then promptly visited a pub, a brewery and a school in the Kent constituency. In his trademark burgundy-coloured blazer, he stepped out from a people carrier and told reporters outside Thanet District Council's offices in Margate that his party represented 'rational common sense'. He then went on to outline some of his pledges, including making Thanet the capital city and bringing HS7 to the area. On why he chose Thanet, he said: 'I heard destiny's call like a trumpet in the far distance and it sounded like it was saying Thanet, so Thanet had to be the place.' He added: 'If I were to win then I would definitely open a pub because I'm going to nationalise pubs if I get the chance.' Murray scoffed at a question about whether he had a dry January like his political opponent Mr Farage, and spoke of his plans to 'demilitarise' North and South Thanet. 'Why can't North and South Thanet walk in harmony together,' he said. On expenses, he said: 'They say there is no such thing as a free lunch but if you are an MP it looks like there are free dinners as well.' Oxford-educated Murray, 46, last month launched an action plan under the guise of his patriotic character in his bid to reach Parliament. He has included a pledge that the UK will leave Europe by 2025 'and the edge of the Solar System by 2050'. And he also has ideas on law and order, with a promise to tackle crime by locking up all unemployed people. Al Murray kissed the ground at Margate railway station, Kent, as he bids to beat Ukip leader Nigel Farage for the South Thanet seat in Parliament . Murray  is standing for Parliament for his newly-formed Free United Kingdom Party (FUKP) On the hot topic of immigration, he plans to stop people reaching the shores of 'the greatest country in the world' by bricking up the Channel Tunnel - with British bricks and using Polish labour. And in a further bid to win over wavering voters, he promises '1p a pint', although 'crisps will remain at the current price'. A website has been set up for his campaign, carrying the slogan: 'Other parties offer the moon on a stick. We'll do better than that: a British moon on a British stick.' CURRENCY . The pound will be revalued at £1.10, so it will now be worth 10p more. NHS . If you come to A&E and it's neither an accident nor an emergency, then you will be sent to a random hospital department to be practised on. FOREIGN POLICY . Germany has been too quiet for too long. Just saying. IMMIGRATION . The reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world. The only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse. EUROPE . Greece to be bought and operated by Kent County Council. Couldn't be worse. Someone to do the bins at least. LAW AND ORDER . Unemployment causes crime: I propose to lock up the unemployed. Murray is standing in a constituency which the Conservative Party won from Labour at the previous election in 2010. It is already the focus of huge attention due to Mr Farage's decision to stand there as Ukip experiences a surge in support and now has two Parliamentary seats. Ukip has welcomed the intervention of The Pub Landlord, with a spokesman for the Eurosceptics saying: 'At last, serious competition in the constituency.' And Mr Farage has said: 'The more, the merrier.' Bookmaker's Ladbrokes last month installed the comedian as a 66/1 chance to take the seat, and evens to outpoll the Lib Dems, with Mr Farage remaining the firm odds on favourite to take the seat from the Conservatives. William Hill also made FUKP the fourth favourite behind Labour but still consider Murray odds on not to get sufficient votes to retain the £500 deposit candidates must pay to take part. South Thanet, which includes the coastal towns of Ramsgate, Sandwich and Broadstairs, has previously enjoyed a reputation as an electoral bellwether - held at every election since 1983 by the party that has formed the government of the day. In 2010 Tory Laura Sandys ousted Labour former minister Stephen Ladyman, who had held the seat since Tony Blair's 1997 landslide when he defeated the constituency's most high-profile former MP, the Tory ex-Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken, who two years later was jailed for perjury. Kent-born Mr Farage stood in South Thanet in 2005, only to finish fourth with 2,079 votes, a 5% share. But Ukip's recent electoral success has made victory in the seat a very real prospect, with the party performing strongly in Kent in last year's European elections. Across the Thanet District Council area Ukip topped the poll, with 16,492 votes, more than double the votes cast for the second-placed Tories. The Free United Kingdom Party's logo features an upturned pound sign, in a clear parody of the Ukip symbol. Murray is not the only celebrity to bidding for a seat in Parliament on May 7. The Happy Mondays dancer Bez - real name Mark Berry - is standing for election for the Reality Party in Salford. Murray launched his bid to win over voters by visiting a pub, a brewery and a school in the Kent constituency . The Pub Landlord Al Murray was given a warm welcome by South Thanet voters despite the weather . The stand-up comic spoke to students at Charles Dickens School in Broadstairs, Kent . During his visit to the Charles Dickens School in Broadstairs, Murray said he was meeting 'the adults of tomorrow' to tell them about 'their chance to change this nation from Great Britain to Amazing Britain'. Asked how seriously he was taking the election campaign, he said: 'Well, only a fool wouldn't take the general election seriously. And a vote for me is a vote for common sense. 'I am the only one taking the General Election seriously – there are too many jokers in politics.' When asked his view on Greece's economy, he told pupils: 'You have to admire them standing up to the Germans.' The comedian told Kent Online: 'It was fantastic to see all of the young voters at the school, although only one of the children present would be eligible to vote at the next election. 'So in fact it was a complete waste of time – but in a very positive way.' He also unveiled an advertising hoarding in true election campaign style with the slogan: 'Vote Common Sense, Vote Guv for Guv'norment.' While on the Kent-bound train, the FUKP leader tweeted: 'The #FUKP team ready to go tell the people of Thanet what they want to hear.' 'Thanet? Well Thanet has all the charms of the Garden of England, picturesque towns, delightful hostelries, as well as the benefits of being on the coast: the place is a double whammy. 'And then there's the people, always welcoming, ever charming, never downhearted.' Mr Murray says he is standing for the Free United Kingdom Party because it is time 'for a bloke waving a pint offering common sense solutions'. Age: 46 . Born: Stewkley, Buckinghamshire .

"Police raided the home of an eBay fur dealer and found coats believed to have been made from animals including wolves, otters and ocelots. Officers were shocked to find skins of the jungle animals at the property in Chorley, Lancashire on Saturday. The sale of rare furs and leathers is only permitted in Britain to those holding a special permit. These three coats thought to be made from wolf fur were among the haul found at the property in Lancashire . Three coats were seized. The trader was not arrested or charged. Police said they were now offering 'advice and support to the person involved to assist them in running their business lawfully'. A picture taken after the raid show coats believed to be made from wolf fur laid out on a police car's bonnet. Another shows an officer picking through a pile of fur coats, one of which appears to show the spots of a ocelot - also known as a dwarf leopard. Preston Police's Wildlife and Rural Crime Officers carried out the raid with the UK National Wildlife Crime Unit. Officers involved in the operation said it is important to realise 'this happens locally, not a distant international issue'. A policeman looks through the huge stash of coats uncovered when they executed a 'Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species search warrant' The fur and skin of endangered animals or fish - and goods such as jewellery, shoes, bags and belts made from them - are banned for import into the UK unless traders have a valid permit. The furs of animals caught in leg-hold traps are also prohibited for import unless accompanied by certification. EU rules control the import of the furs of wild badger, beaver, bobcat, coyote, ermine, fisher, lynx, marten, musk rat, raccoon, otter, sable and wolf. Commercial imports of baby harp seal and hooded seal skins are also prohibited, as well as the sale of any product made from seals. One of the furs was advertised as that of an ocelot - a small jungle cat known also called the dwarf leopard .","Trade of rare furs and animal skins is strictly controlled in the UK .

"The deaths of two state troopers who were shot in a remote Alaska community on Thursday have highlighted the dangers the force faces as it patrols remote and difficult terrain. 'This will take us a long time to heal,' Colonel James Cockrell said on Friday, as 19-year-old Nathaniel Lee Kangas was arrested in connection with the shooting. Trooper Gabriel 'Gabe' Rich, 26, and Sergeant Patrick 'Scott' Johnson, 45, were killed in the isolated community of Tanana, which has no roads and a population of only 238. Victims: Gabriel Rich, left, and Patrick Johnson were shot as they responded to a call in a remote village . Crime scene: The officers were shot as they tried to arrest Arvin Kangas at this Tanana house in Alaska . 'Currently department members are dealing with shock and disbelief trying to make sense of Sergeant Johnson and Trooper Rich's deaths,' Cockrell told KTUU. Like many troopers assigned to patrol multiple villages, Rich and Johnson worked from a rural service base about 130 miles from Tanana, which they reached by plane. The men and their rugged patrol route had featured on a National Geographic reality show, Alaska State Troopers. No formal charges have been brought against Kangas yet, but police believe he used a semi-automatic rifle to kill the two troopers. His 58-year-old father, Arvin Kangas, has also been arrested, and is facing charges of assault over a confrontation on Wednesday with Mark Haglin, the village's unarmed public safety officer. The elder Kangas was said to have been angry about a sofa sale, Cockrell said. At one point, Arvin Kangas pointed a shotgun at Haglin as the public safety officer drove by the suspect's house, troopers said. Village public safety officers are unarmed, but a bill passed by lawmakers this year would allow for the arming of the officers, who serve as first responders in rural communities that can be located hours or days - depending on the weather - from the nearest state trooper. Reached by telephone, Haglin referred questions to troopers. Only sketchy details have been released about what transpired before the shootings in the community, where residents live a traditional Athabascan lifestyle, including hunting and fishing for their food. Arrest: Arvin Kangas has been charged with assault and his 19-year-old son Nathaniel is being held in connection with the shootings . Evidence: Forensic science officers arrive at the remote village as they investigate the double shooting . Cut off: Investigators take photos on the porch of the house, where the troopers had confronted a man about an earlier alleged gun threat . Tanana resident Ruby Cruger is related to the Kangas family, but said she did not know the details of the shooting, just that it has affected the entire community. 'They're all shocked,' Cruger said of the town's reaction to the shooting. The troopers arrived in Tanana at about 2.45pm on Thursday to serve an arrest warrant on the elder Kangas. Cockrell said the troopers soon encountered the elder Kangas just outside the front door of his home. They were trying to place him under arrest when a struggle erupted, and the three men went inside through the door, where the younger Kangas shot the officers at about 3pm, according to troopers. Shortly after, the village officer notified troopers, saying one of the officers was dead and the other one possibly also. It is not clear what role the village officer played at the scene, although he was in the vicinity when the shootings occurred, Cockrell said. Loss: Sergeant Scott Johnson, pictured, was a father of three girls . Reality show: Alaska trooper Gabe Rich is pictured on the National Geographic show he featured in . Nathanial Kangas was arrested soon after. His father ran to another home and surrendered late Thursday night, according to troopers. Both are in custody in Fairbanks. Rich and Johnson were occasionally featured on the National Geographic Channel show Alaska State Troopers, which features multiple troopers patrolling the state's wild terrain. The troopers were not filming at the time of their deaths. Filming in the fifth season is currently being done with other troopers. National Geographic said in a statement that it was 'incredibly saddened' to learn of the deaths. Spokesman Chris Albert said the troopers are among the many who are subjected to the daily challenges of working in isolated areas of the state, such as Tanana. Johnson was born in Fairbanks and grew up in the Alaska community of Tok. He was a veteran trooper who joined the force in 1993. He spent his career in Fairbanks and worked a variety of roles, including patrol trooper, field training officer and as a canine officer, instructor and canine unit supervisor. The husband and father of three daughters also had worked as a supervisor of a Fairbanks-area narcotics team. Rich was born in Sayre, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Fairbanks. He first worked as a patrolman with the North Pole Police Department southeast of Fairbanks before deciding to join the troopers in 2011. With the troopers, he spent most of his career on patrol. Survivors include his fiance, their one-year-old son and his fiance's eight-year-old son. At the time of his death, Rich was in the process of adopting the older boy, troopers said. Johnson and Rich joined the interior rural unit on January 1. The unit covers 23 villages scattered across a sparse terrain. Their deaths came the same day the name of Manokotak village public safety Officer Thomas Madole was added to the Indian Country Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Artesia, New Mexico. Madole was shot and killed March 19, 2013, while responding to a domestic violence call in the Alaska Native village. Remote village: The troopers were killed in Tanana, which is only accessible by boat or plane . Before Thursday, 64 law enforcement officers had been killed in the line of duty since 1897 in Alaska, according to information previously provided by the Alaska State Troopers. Police memorials in Fairbanks, Anchorage and Juneau are being planned to pay tribute to the slain troopers. Gov. Sean Parnell said in a statement that he and his wife, Sandy, 'were deeply saddened to learn of the senseless, brutal crime that took the lives of two of Alaska's finest. 'These fallen heroes answered the call to serve and protect, and made the ultimate sacrifice, while keeping our communities safe.'","Nathaniel Kangas, 19, arrested for double shooting in Tanana community .

"If you thought you'd seen the last of 'Tan Mom', think again. Patricia Krentcil, known for frying herself to a crisp on dangerous tanning beds, is back on the scene - but not as you know her. The 47-year-old, whose overly tanned appearance made her an overnight sensation, is barely recognisable after ditching her orange hue. Scroll down for video . 'Tan mom' Patricia Krentcil is back and she's ditched the sunbeds but is hooked on Botox . Showing off her new look in Closer magazine, Patricia did, however, reveal that she's swapped tanning in favour of a new beauty treatment: Botox. The mother, from Nutley, New Jersey, revealed she has the £200 injections every three months - and her new paler look has even boosted her sex life with stockerbroker husband, 49-year-old Richard. 'I started reading about celebrities having Botox and realised that could give me the same confidence without damaging my skin,' she explained. 'I couldn't believe the results.'

Admitting her tanning addiction was a 'huge mistake', the mother-of-three explains that her family feared for her health so she decided to quit the beds. Patricia became notorious for frying herself to a crisp on dangerous tanning beds . Patricia, pictured in 2012, admits her tanning addiction was a 'huge mistake' and says she's quit the beds . In 2012 she was accused of taking her five-year-old daughter, Anna, into a tanning booth. She faced child endangerment charges after school officials noticed burns on her daughter's legs, which Patricia claimed came from sunburn when her child played outdoors. While she eventually was absolved of the charges, her overly tanned appearance made her an overnight sensation and she was paid thousands of pounds to attend events. She also entered herself into World Xtreme Entertainment's Celebrity Boxing contest, to fight Ang Cottone, aka, Milf Mom, last year. But Krentcil couldn't wait for the ring and after chugging down beer at the press conference table (she completed a stay in rehab last year for alcohol abuse) she started on her opponent. Things got so turbulent that Krentcil needed to be restrained after flipping the table at the event in Woodlyn, Pennsylvania.

"Residents who one year ago fought vainly to stop flooding destroying their homes have finally returned to Somerset to rebuild their lives, as seen in this remarkable series of pictures illustrating their recovery. In January and February last year, residents abandoned their homes after record rainfall saw rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging. More than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were inundated with quickly rising waters and entire villages were cut off in the wettest January since records began in 1766. Now, 12 months on, many of the families caught up in the devastation have moved back into their homes. For many, it comes after painstaking and tiring battles with insurers and builders. A number of measures have also been taken to ensure the tragedy is not repeated, including the dredging of the Rivers Tone and Parrett, to remove 130,000 cubic meters of silt. And builder Lee Goddard was fined £1,000 after becoming the first person in Britain to be convicted of opening a sluice gate - after he was found to have opened sluice gates to protect his own property at the height of the floods, sending 45,000 cubic metres of water rushing towards local village Thorney. Though prosecutors said it could not be confirmed whether Goddard’s actions had directly caused damage to properties in Thorney, he was accused of exacerbating the plight of villagers. Scroll down for video . Families forced to flee their waterlogged homes following last winter’s devastating floods on the Levels have finally returned to their properties one year on. On the left, Somerset Levels is pictured as muddy swampland during the February 2014 flooding. Right, it is pictured as it appears today . Resident Mark Corthine wades through his flooded kitchen last year (left), while on the right, he is pictured in the kitchen again today. More than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were in a similar position after quickly rising waters inundated entire villages . It is only after a year of battles with insurers and builders that many relieved residents are finally able to move back into their homes.

The 63-year-old said: 'We’re back into our house and it is looking good. It’s taken us time, we moved back in pretty much a year to to the day we left' Last year's flooding, which was the worst on record for the region, meant Mr Corthine needed a boat to travel through his backyard (left). Despite the devastation, he considers himself fortunate. He said: 'The affect it has had on people is absolutely catastrophic. Some people have lost absolutely everything. This will affect some of the local people for a very long time, a very long time indeed.' These photographs show the main street in Moorland, Somerset, at the height of the flooding (left) and again yesterday (right).

Before and after: Moorland Village Hall (pictured) was also flooded - on the left, a car can be seen partially submerged.

"A plunging neckline closing three inches below a woman's cleavage is the new super-low-cut trend being worn by the the biggest names on the red carpet.

But fast forward a few years and it seems the silicone trend is officially out. Scroll down for video .

Transform Cosmetic Group has seen a trend in people requesting more modest implants over the last five years, with the most requested cup size now being a C. Speaking about the trend for going silicone-free, Mark Norfolk, Clinical Director at Transform, said: 'We’ve seen a real trend in people requesting more natural looks when opting for cosmetic surgery and non-surgical procedures. 'Over the last four-five years, requests have evolved significantly. For instance, we are seeing an increasing number of women opting for more modest breast implants. 'In fact, over the last year, we’ve found that a third of patients are asking for a full cup C and the most requested cup sizes currently, are a C or D and not the larger implants that we’ve seen in the past. Jennifer Aniston, pictured at last month's SAG Awards, is just one of a growing number of A-listers embracing a natural silhouette. It seems it's rubbing off on the public with Transform Cosmetic Group noting a trend in more people requesting more modest implants over the last five years . Indeed, Victoria Beckham admitted in 2014 that she underwent breast augmentation after giving birth to her first son, Brooklyn, in 1999. She then made the decision to reverse the treatment taking her from artificial 34DDs to 34Bs. 'I don't have them anymore,' she told Allure magazine in 2014, after reportedly seeing an old photo of herself with a fuller chest. 'I think I may have purchased them. Or they got removed, one or the other.' When asked if they had been removed, the mother-of-four replied: 'Yeah'. Katie Price, with her award for Cover Girl Of The Decade at the Loaded magazine 10th Birthday Awards in 2004 and, right, Pamela Anderson in 2002, both underwent breast augmentations . In December 2014, Katie reduced her cup size by five, taking her down to a C . Plastic surgeon superfan Heidi Montag also underwent a reduction in 2013. The Hills star went under the knife in Los Angeles to get her F-Cup breasts reduced down to a size C. And it seems the stars are influencing the British public. Mark added: 'Celebrities have a huge influence on ladies' fashion and beauty choices and they are certainly influencing this trend. With the likes and popularity of Victoria Beckham and the Duchess of Cambridge, who both have a more natural look, it seems that the women of the UK are following suit and going for a more sophisticated kind of beauty.' Dr Patrick Mallucci from the Cadogan Clinic agrees and thinks the natural look is 'long overdue'. He said: 'There is a definite change in the emphasis on ""look"" in breast augmentation. Natural breast enlargement is the new buzz word. All of the research I have done on breast beauty indicates that the natural breast is universally preferred by both men, women and across cultures. 'It is changing the way in which women are approaching the issue of breast augmentation and how we are encouraging surgeons to approach the way they deliver their surgery. It is a healthy change which is long overdue.'

"Married: Friends of Yusra Hussien, who went missing in October, say she has married in Syria . A schoolgirl who fled her family home in Bristol last year to join ISIS has told friends she has become a Jihadi bride, according to reports. Suspected teenage ISIS convert, Yusra Hussien, vanished when she was just 15 and is believed to have boarded a flight to Turkey in a bid to get to Syria with Samya Dirie, 17, from London. It is understood she has contacted friends to say she is now married - despite not getting in touch with her distraught family since her disappearance from her home in Easton, Bristol, in October. Her friends have reportedly told the BBC that the teenager contacted them on social media to confirm she was now married in Syria. However her family deny the claims and say they are unaware as to whether Yusra has got married. A woman who answered the door at the family's home today said: 'We have not heard from Yusra. Apparently she has told friends she has got married but we know nothing about it. 'We only heard this when a reporter called to ask us. As far as we know it's not true.' Speaking last night, family spokesperson Anira Khokhar added: 'The family have spoken to her close friends - which is only two - and they say she has not been in touch with them. 'It is all very difficult for the family who are trying to rebuild their lives.' Yusra told her family she would be home late from a school trip but her father raised the alarm when she failed to to meet him at nearby City Academy, where she was a talented student. Her aunt, Sucdi Ali, believes Yusra was radicalised online after spending increasing amounts of time on her laptop and smart phone. News of her apparent marriage comes as two British teenage sisters, who fled to Syria to marry ISIS fighters, posted pictures of themselves on social media during 'self defence training'. Zahra and Salma Halane, both 17, of Chorlton, Manchester left their homes last June after becoming radicalised online. The pictures have been posted on one of the twins' Twitter accounts, and shows four veiled women holding AK-47 assault rifles and handguns. They are believed to be part of an all-female religious police brigade alongside former public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, 20, from Glasgow, who enforce Sharia law on the streets of Raqqa. Missing: Yusra disappeared from her home in Bristol and is thought to have caught a plane to Turkey before crossing the border into Syria in October . When 15-year-old Yusra went missing, her heartbroken mother Safiya Hussien, 40, pleaded for her to return. 'Please come back. Please, we miss you. Please,' she said. 'I'm your mum, I love you, please come back. Please, please, please we miss you. 'I love you so much, all your brothers and sister, we miss you so much, the house is not the same since when you left.' Her distraught family said the 'last thing' her brothers and sisters wanted to hear was that she had become a 'jihadist bride'. Speaking at the time of her disappearance, Ms Khokhar said: 'We have to ensure that as a community - a British community - we all come together and unite and protect those young kids. 'The last thing they want to see about their sister is words such as ""jihadist bride"" or ""radicalisation"" or ""extremism"" because that's not the case at this present moment.'

"Ukip has backed plans to outlaw the killing of animals for meat in the UK without stunning them first . Nigel Farage has been accused of  driving Jews from Britain after his party pledged to ban the ritual slaughter of animals. Ukip has backed plans to outlaw the killing of animals for meat in the UK without stunning them first. The RSPCA and British Veterinary Association have called for the practice to be made illegal, but David Cameron has promised to keep exemptions for religious purposes such as Muslim halal and Jewish shechita. Ukip said it was ‘about time someone stood up for the rights of the silent majority in the ethical treatment of animals instead of bowing down to those who shout the loudest’. The party’s agricultural spokesman said that losing Jewish was ‘collateral damage’ as there were ‘more votes to be gained’ elsewhere. In a statement the party said: ‘We respect religious groups to carry out slaughter in the UK according to how they define and read their scriptures. ‘What we do not allow however is for the rights and demands of groups within those religion override the UK’s compassionate traditions of animal welfare. ‘Animal and veterinary science has long concluded that cutting the throats of animals whilst they are fully conscious can cause significant distress and pain. ‘We see no reason why religious groups should not take into account the concerns of animal welfare when carrying out slaughter.’ The policy was adopted by Ukip following a meeting of its ruling national executive committee. Stuart Agnew, the party’s agricultural spokesman, told the Jewish Chronicle that he had been against the policy change, but had been over-ruled. He said: ‘There are more votes to be gained and I expect that’s what they were looking for. We’ll lose the Jewish vote for sure, but we might gain votes elsewhere – and that’s what they’re after, general election votes.’ Mr Agnew said the policy was not meant to 'target' Jews - suggesting concern about halal meat traditionally eaten by Muslims was the real driving force behind the ban. He said: 'This isn’t aimed at you – it’s aimed elsewhere – it’s aimed at others. 'You’ve been caught in the crossfire; collateral damage. You know what I mean.' Ukip’s decision comes after footage emerged of a worker at a halal abattoir  ‘hacking and sawing’ at animals’ throats . Ukip’s decision comes after a petition demanding an outright ban on slaughtering animals without stunning them first attracted more than 100,000 signatures. It comes after footage emerged of a worker at a halal abattoir breaking strict rules on slaughtering sheep. The men could face prosecution for the ‘horrifying yet routine abuse’ captured by animal rights campaigners using hidden cameras. Slaughtermen at the Bowood Lamb abattoir in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, are seen ‘hacking and sawing’ at animals’ throats in apparent contravention of Islamic practice. The policy change was met with dismay by campaign group Shechita UK, which said Mr Farage had previously supported the Jewish community’s right to continue the practice. Campaign director Shimon Cohen said: ‘Citing weak, agenda-led science, Ukip has become the first major political party in the UK to call for a ban on religious slaughter. ‘This latest move is opportunistic and a disappointing shift from Ukip’s previous position. ‘By joining the campaign to prioritise “animal welfare” over the rights and beliefs of the UK’s faith communities Ukip has returned to the fringes of mainstream politics.’ David Cameron has ruled out banning the religious slaughter of animals. Jewish Chronicle editor Stephen Pollard (right) said Ukip were telling Jews 'they may not keep kosher and remain in the UK' Jewish Chronicle editor Stephen Pollard tweeted: ‘Be clear what Ukip’s stance means. They are telling Jews they may not keep kosher and remain in the UK.’ Figures released by the BVA show the number of animals having their throats cut while conscious has risen 60 per cent in the past year. Some 2.4 million sheep and goats were killed without being stunned in halal and Jewish shechita abattoirs last year, according to the BVA. Following the petition calling for the practice to be outlawed, the Government said it ‘encourages the highest standards of welfare at slaughter and would prefer to see all animals stunned before they are slaughtered for food’ but ‘we also respect the rights of the Jewish and Muslim communities to eat meat prepared in accordance with their religious beliefs’.","Ukip backs plans to outlaw killing of animals for meat  without stunning .

"Reid, 41, claimed in a new letter that it was part of God's plan for his attempted bombing of a passenger jet in 2001 to fail . Failed shoe-bomber Richard Reid has claimed that God wanted him to bungle his attempt to blow up a transatlantic flight soon after 9/11. Reid, 41, recently replied to a letter from a researcher of Islamic terrorism in which he said that it was not in God's plan for him to die in 2001 - or the other 197 passengers on American Airlines Flight 63. Reid also said he believed his attempted act of terrorism would be permitted by Islamic law. In a letter, shown this week to NBC, he wrote: 'However, at the same time I also believe that it wasn't supposed to happen, not because it was displeasing to God … rather because it was not either my time to die nor that of those on the plane with me, and he had other plans for me which include my staying in prison and other matters which I may not be aware of as of yet.' In a separate letter, Reid said that he did not see the terrorist attacks at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo as a tragedy because the victims 'insulted Islam'. He also wrote to Dr Kimberly Mehlman-Orozco that although he had 'tactical regrets', he does not regret losing his freedom. British-born Reid is serving life without parole at a supermax prison in Colorado known as 'the Alcatraz of the Rockies'. He was jailed in 2003 after he attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his trainers on a Paris to Miami flight on December 22, 2001. Scroll down for video . Passengers on board the flight from Paris to Miami on December 22, 2001 were pictured subduing attempted shoe-bomber Richard Reid . During his trial, he told the court that he was an enemy of the U.S. and 'a soldier of Allah'. The court heard how passengers complained of smoke in the cabin shortly after an in-flight meal. Reid was discovered sitting alone trying to light a match, where flight attendants told him smoking was forbidden. He promised to stop but, a few minutes later, the attendant saw him hunched over in his seat holding one of his shoes which had a fuse leading into it. The attendant called for help and passengers stepped in to subdue the 6ft 4in terrorist by binding him with plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions and headphone cords. A doctor on board sedated Reid with a tranquilizer he found in the plane's emergency medical kit. The flight was diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston. Tests on the explosives later revealed that Reid, who had been denied access to a flight 24 hours earlier because of his agitated behaviour, had been walking in rainy weather which had caused the fuse to be too damp to ignite. The shoes used in the failed attempt to blow up an airplane by shoe bomber Richard Reid (right) are displayed alongside an FBI model of the shoe filled with explosives . His attempted bombing led to heightened security at airports across the world, with all airline passengers departing from the U.S. now having to pass through airport security in socks or bare feet while their shoes are scanned. Other countries choose passengers at random to undergo the screening. Dr Mehlman-Orozco is director of a non-profit organization known as The Justitia Institute which examines issues of immigration and social justice along with the radicalization of extremists. She explained in an interview that having spoken to convicted terrorists, including Reid and 'Jihadi Jane' Colleen LaRose, the common factor was not a hatred for Americans but 'an extreme love for their God and obedience for the jihadist who recruited them'.","Reid, 41,  said it was not in God's plan for him to die in 2001 or the other 197 passengers on American Airlines Flight 63 .

"A scantily clad couple play provocatively on a bed. As massage oil flows, talk turns to bondage equipment and other explicit topics. Some tawdry late-night show on a subscription porn channel? No. This was daytime on ITV yesterday. Scroll down for video . Don't adjust the TV set! ITV's This Morning today unveiled a segment called Bondage For Beginners, which featured a live demonstration of 50 Shades of Grey inspired sex toys . Hosts Christine Bleakely (left) and Philip Schofield were barely able to concentrate on their lines . And viewers who tuned in to This Morning expecting the usual mix of light news, fashion and cookery were clearly not amused. Within minutes many were expressing their disbelief on Twitter, pointing out that the live show is broadcast at a time when many young children may be watching. They described the programme’s content as pornographic and ‘ridiculously inappropriate’ for daytime TV. The ‘Bondage For Beginners’ session was aired ahead of Valentine’s Day and inspired by the new film of the controversial erotic novel 50 Shades Of Grey, which opens in cinemas next week. Presenters Christine Bleakley and Phillip Schofield giggled their way through the show, which also featured a discussion about sex toys. Schofield, 52, had warned viewers shortly after 10.30am that they would be discussing bondage equipment in three stages – beginners, intermediate and advanced – throughout the show with ‘sexpert’ Annabelle Knight. However he assured them it would ‘be done in good taste’. Backlash: Viewers took to Twitter to vent their disgust at the Bondage For Beginners segment . Angry viewers have taken to social media to air their disgust . The demonstration of sex toys created a Twitter backlash . One viewer described the segment as 'sickening' Yet at one point Schofield was so distracted by the romping models that he missed his cue to introduce the next section, while Miss Bleakley, 36, found herself laughing uncontrollably. Media watchdog Ofcom said afterwards that it had received 50 complaints and was assessing whether to start an investigation. Campaigners said it was an error of judgment to air the discussion at that time of day. Vivienne Pattison, director of Mediawatch UK, said the show had set a dangerous example: ‘It’s not enough to say most children will be at school [at that time] because that’s just not good enough. ‘Quite apart from issues of taste and the fact that people might not want to speak to their children about this, I think it is dangerous to normalise this kind of behaviour. [50 Shades Of Grey] is putting across ideas that humiliation is pleasurable and torture is gratifying and I don’t think those are healthy for anybody at all.

"A man who spent more than two decades on Delaware's death row has walked free into the arms of his family after a judge ruled a confession he gave while high on drugs could no longer be relied upon by prosecutors. Jermaine Wright, 42, walked out of the maximum-security prison in Smyrna to the delight of his mother Delores, on Friday, 24 years to the day after he was taken into custody following the 1991 killing of a liquor store clerk near Wilmington. But his reprieve may only be temporary after Superior Court Judge John A Parkins Jr's ruling his confession should be suppressed. Jermaine Wright (right) with his mother, Delores Wright, in Wilmington after his release from prison . This is because prosecutors who moved last week to dismiss the charges against Wright following that ruling will now appeal against it to the Delaware Supreme Court with a view to refiling charges against Wright should they be successful. Nevertheless one of Wright's defence attorneys Herb Mondros said of his release: 'It was an emotional reunion with his family. It was quite a day. 'He and his mom embraced, he walked out the door, said ""thank you"" to the guards, put his stuff in the car and we drove off.' Before Parkins initially overturned Wright's conviction and death sentence in a 2012 ruling, which was subsequently reversed by the state Supreme Court, Wright had spent more time on death row than any other Delaware inmate currently facing execution. He was sentenced to death for the murder of Phillip Seifert, 66, at the Hi-Way Inn liquor store and bar outside Wilmington on January 14, 1991. In overturning Wright's conviction and death sentence, Parkins ruled in 2012 that a confession Wright gave to police during an interrogation lasting nearly 13 hours was defective because he had not been properly advised of his Miranda rights against self-incrimination and to have an attorney appointed for him. The confession was a linchpin for prosecutors at Wright's 1992 murder trial, and Wood has said it's unlikely that prosecutors would proceed with the case without the confession. Wright was convicted of the murder of Phillip Seifert, 66, at the Hi-Way Inn liquor store and bar outside Wilmington on January 14, 1991 . 'The police extracted Mr. Wright's confession after 13 hours of interrogation in a windowless 13 x 10 room while handcuffed to a table,' Mondros said in a written statement on Friday. 'Mr Wright, who was 18 at the time, was under the influence of heroin and, as the Superior Court found, behaved bizarrely, a fact ignored by his interrogators. 'The result was a so-called confession that was factually inconsistent with the physical evidence and eyewitness accounts, and found wholly unreliable by the court.' Parkins also ruled in 2012 that Wright's case was prejudiced by the failure of the chief investigating officer to advise prosecutors, and thereby defence attorneys, of an attempted robbery at Brandywine Village Liquors, less than two miles from the Hi-Way Inn, about half an hour before Seifert was killed. Wright's attorneys have argued that such evidence might have exonerated him. The Delaware Supreme Court will decide whether the ruling to suppress Wright's confession should stand . 'The evidence of this close in time and proximity robbery supports a reasonable inference that the [Brandywine] perpetrators were also the Hi-Way Inn perpetrators, and thus that Wright was not involved in either crime,' Justice Henry duPont Ridgely wrote in a dissenting opinion when the state Supreme Court reinstated Wright's conviction in 2013. Following yet another appeal on issues defence attorneys said were left unresolved in its earlier decision, the Supreme Court sent the case back to Parkins, ruling unanimously last year that Wright was entitled to a new trial because prosecutors repeatedly withheld potentially exculpatory evidence. 'The admissibility of Wright's confession was fully litigated before the Superior Court in 1992, and in the Delaware Supreme Court in 1993,' said deputy attorney general Steve Wood. 'Now, we will ask the Delaware Supreme Court to finally resolve the issue.'","Jermaine Wright, 42, walked free into his mother Delores' arms on Friday .

"A California man could face 20 years in prison for running a revenge porn site and orchestrating a scheme for victims to pay to have their images removed after being convicted Monday. Kevin Bollaert, 28, was found guilty of 27 counts of identity theft and extortion for operating ugotposted.com, where anonymous users posted nude photos, often of women and often without their consent. Accompanying most of the photos were victims' names, residences and identifying information such as links to social media accounts, authorities stated. Convicted: Kevin Bollaert, 28, faces up to 20 years after being found guilty of extortion and identity theft for running a scheme for victims to pay to have their images removed from his revenge porn site . He also ran changemyreputation.com, where victims could pay fees of up to $350 to scrub their images and data from Bollaert's other site. California state law regarding identity theft prohibits the posting of personal information like names and addresses, 'for any unlawful purpose, including with the intent to annoy or harass. Authorities believe the conviction is the first against a revenge porn website operator, coming ahead of the trial of Hunter Moore, called 'the most hated man on the Internet' for running isanyoneup.com. Bollaert notably was not charged under the state's new law criminalizing revenge porn, which was signed after he reportedly shut down ugotposted.com. Prosecutors claimed that visitors to Bollaert's site posted more than 10,000 nude photos between 2012 and 2013. They also explained Bollaert made tens of thousands of dollars after victims visited changemyreputation.com and paid between $300 and $350 to get photos removed. Ruined: In spite of the thousands of emails he got begging to have photos taken down, Bollaert told investigators his life had been ruined by the site . Investigators found that Bollaert received thousands of distressed emails from victims, one who said she was 'scared for my life' and another who said she'd been 'getting nonstop harassing messages.' The criminal complaint named more than two dozen people as victims, one of whom claimed she was thrown out of her home after her family found out nude photos had been posted of her. 'It ruined my life and I'm still going through it,' she testified. 'I lost my family. They think that I brought shame on them. My reputation is ruined.' Bollaert's lawyer, Emily Rose-Weber, had argued that while the website may have been immoral, he did not break the law by allowing others to use the site to post photos. 'It's gross, it's offensive, but it's not illegal,' she said. Mashable reported that Bollaert, in an interview with agents from the California Department of Justice's eCrime Unit, explained the site was 'just like ruining my life.' 'Yeah, I realize like this is not a good situation,' Bollaert said according to the complaint. 'I feel bad about the whole thing and like I just don't want to do it anymore.' 'I mean I know a lot of people are getting screwed over like on the site. Like their lives are getting ruined,' he said.","Kevin Bollaert was found guilty of 27 counts of identity theft and extortion .

"A simple probiotic pill that 'rewires' the body could cure both types of diabetes, scientists claim. The new drug, which contains live bacteria from the human gut, has been shown to drastically lower blood sugar levels. The pancreas is the organ which controls glucose levels in the body in healthy individuals. But scientists at Cornell University in New York discovered a protein secreted from a human probiotic could shift that control from the pancreas to the upper intestine. Scroll down for video . A daily probiotic pill could cure both types of diabetes scientists at Cornell University in New York hope adter they discovered a specific probiotic, commonly found in the human gut, could lower blood sugar levels in diabetic rats by up to 30 per cent . The breakthrough, which relies on 'rewiring' the body, could, the Cornell team hope, pave the way for a cure for both type 1 and 2 diabetes. Professor John March, who led the new research, said their findings are a 'proof of principle' which could prove the first step to developing a cure. He told the Express: 'If it works really well in people, it could be that they just take the pill and wouldn't have to do anything else to control their diabetes. 'It's likely, though, that it will be used in conjunction with some other treatment.' Diabetes is a life-long health condition where there is too much glucose in the blood because the body cannot use it properly. The pancreas of a diabetes sufferer is unable to produce any insulin, or not enough. It can also be the case the insulin produced is unable to work properly. Insulin is essential to the body, acting as the key that unlocks the door to the body's cells so glucose can enter and provide energy. With diabetes, the body is unable to use glucose as fuel and instead glucose builds up in the blood. Professor March's team engineered a strain of lactobacillus, a human probiotic commonly found in the gut, to secrete a peptide - a hormone that releases insulin in response to food entering the body. The scientists then gave a group of diabetic rats the probiotic in pill form for a period of 90 days. They monitored the rats' blood glucose levels, comparing their findings with a control group of rats, not exposed to the probiotic pill. The researchers found the treatment 'rewired' the bodies of diabetic rats, shifting control of blood sugar levels from the pancreas, highlighted, to the upper intestine . The team found those rats given the new drug had blood glucose levels which were up to 30 per cent lower than those rats not given the modified probiotic treatment. But another finding proved just as exciting. The scientists found the cells in the upper intestine of the diabetic rats given the treatment were converted into cells that acted similarly to pancreatic cells - which in healthy people secrete insulin to maintain and balance glucose levels. Professor March, from the university's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, said: 'The amount of time to reduce glucose levels following a meal is the same as in a normal rat, and it is matched to the amount of glucose in the blood. 'It is moving the centre of glucose control from the pancreas to the upper intestine.' Professor March said while the probiotic treatment replaced the insulin capacity in diabetic rats, in those free of the condition the researchers found no change in blood glucose levels, when the treatment was administered. 'If the rat is managing its glucose, it doesn't need more insulin,' he added. Professor March said the next step would be to test higher doses of the treatment to establish if the probiotic could reverse the condition altogether. He said if successful, the probiotic could then be made into a pill that diabetic patients would take each morning to help control their condition. The probiotic lactobacillus is already used and approved as a treatment for diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease, among other conditions. The study, published in the journal Diabetes, was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Hartwell Foundation. Richard Elliott, from Diabetes UK, said: 'This study focused on rats, and years of further research including clinical trials in humans will be needed before we know if the probiotic used would have the same benefits in people, or if it could become a routine treatment for people living with diabetes. 'It is especially important to note that the probiotic used in the study is different to the probiotic dairy products that are already widely available. 'Currently, the best way to manage diabetes is by taking existing medications prescribed by your doctor, and maintaining a healthy weight by following a healthy balanced diet and taking regular exercise.' Type 1 diabetes . Type 1 develops when the insulin-producing cells in the body have been destroyed, leaving the body unable to produce any insulin at all. Everyone diagnosed with type 1 is treated with insulin. Scientists  don't know why the insulin-producing cells are destroyed in people with the condition. All those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes are treated with insulin, pictured . It is thought to be caused by an abnormal, autoimmune, reaction to the cells, which could be triggered by a virus or other infection. Experts believe there is a genetic element to type 1 diabetes. It is more common in some parts of the world than others. Unlike type 2, type 1 diabetes has nothing to do with lifestyle or weight. The condition can develop at any age, but is usually diagnosed before the age of 40, most commonly in late childhood. Around 10 per cent of the 2.9 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the UK have type 1. Type 2 diabetes . The condition develops when the body is still able to make insulin, but not enough. It also develops when the insulin that is produced by the body does not work properly - known as insulin resistance. Initially, type 2 diabetes can be controlled with a healthy diet and regular exercise. Being obese or overweight is the biggest risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes . Medication is also often required and a large number of sufferers eventually progress to needing insulin. People who are overweight and have a large waist, are more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes - it is the biggest risk factor. Those who have a close relative with the condition, or who are from a black or South Asian background are also at increased risk. The condition usually affects those aged over 40, but people from South Asia are commonly affected from the age of 25. Around 90 per cent of the 2.9 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the UK have type 2.

"This is the moment a sham marriage bride  is handcuffed minutes before her wedding ceremony after a suspicious registrar told investigators the 'couple' couldn't spell each other's names. Nigerian Joseph Iwueke, 33, was due to marry Slovakian Ingrida Stojkova, 29, in Leeds last July so he could stay in Britain. But they were arrested moments before their fake wedding was due to start after officials at a pre-marriage meeting noticed the groom reading details about his supposed bride from the back of his hand. Iwueke, Stojkova and two others have now been jailed for conspiracy to facilitate a breach of UK immigration law. Scroll down for video . Slovakian Ingrida Stojkova is handcuffed as she waits for her Nigerian husband-to-be to arrive ahead of their planned sham marriage in Leeds last summer. She has now been jailed . When questioned, Nigerian Joseph Iwueke knew almost nothing about his wife-to-be. A court heard he organised the fake wedding so he could stay in the UK . Leeds Crown Court heard that authorities had been tipped off by a registrar who became suspicious when the pair attended the register office a month earlier and were unable to spell each other's names. Two other men - Obinna Odelugo, 49, and Robert Stojka - were also arrested at the ceremony and found in possession of bundles of cash. They were described as the 'fixers' who arranged the fake wedding for financial gain. Odelugo ran from the ceremony room in West Yorkshire but was found hiding in a toilet cubicle. Stojka had initially claimed to be acting as an interpreter for Stojvoka, of Bolton, Lancashire. Nadim Bashir, prosecuting, said: 'His arrival in jogging bottoms to the wedding ceremony left a lot to be desired as to his real purpose in attending.' Iwueke was jailed for two years and nine months and Stojkova was given a 15-month sentence after they pleaded guilty to to conspiracy to facilitate a breach of immigration law. Odelugo, of London, and Stojka, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, were both given sentences of two years and three months after also admitting conspiracy to facilitate a breach of immigration law. The couple's wedding was interrupted by Home Office investigators and police after a tip-off from a registrar . The pair were jailed along with two 'fixers', including Obinna Odelugo, who organised the sham, a court heard . Stojka was ordered to pay back £1,000 within seven days, while Odelugo was ordered to pay back £2,000. The court heard Iwueke was desperate to be married to someone from an EU country so he could remain in the UK. He will be deported after completing the prison sentence. Stojkova agreed to be his bride in the hope that she would make a financial gain to help make a better life in the UK for her and her son. When confronted by officers, Iwueke and Stojkova continued to insist that their marriage was genuine, but when they were asked they were still unable to spell each other's surname, the court heard. Iwueke was unable to tell officers Stojkova's date of birth, where in Slovakia she was from, where she lived and what her house was like. Stojkova told police she met Iwueke in a nightclub in Bolton and they had arranged to meet for coffee the next day, despite not having a common language. When pressed by officers to name and describe the nightclub she became upset and began shouting that she did not want to talk anymore and that she loved Iwueke. Iwueke (left) was jailed for two years and Odelugo (right) was given a two-year, three-month sentence . Sentencing, Judge Sally Cahill QC said to Iwueke: 'This conspiracy involved you Iwueke, who had come to this country from elsewhere, you had been due to leave this country in July last year. 'Instead of staying through lawful channels you entered into an arranged marriage. 'You were the groom and in my view the person who had the most to gain as you would have been free to stay in this country.' She told Stojka and Odelugo they arranged this marriage 'purely for financial gain' and an 'opportunity to make some quick money'. Judge Cahill told Stojkova: 'You entered this arrangement because you hoped you would be looked after. You clearly didn't know each other. 'You saw an opportunity for yourself to gain a better life. In my view you had the least to gain.' After the case, Home Office investigator Mark Runagall, from Immigration Enforcement Criminal Investigations, said: 'This group are now paying the price for what was a cynical attempt to bypass the UK's immigration laws. 'Sham marriage abuse will not be tolerated. We work closely with registrars to identify suspicious marriages and we will rigorously pursue those who try to cheat the system. 'Whether you are an organiser or a participant, we will catch up with you and you will be sent to prison.'","Couple  registered for marriage and were due to marry last summer .

"Children as young as three have been forced to watch the public flogging of six men accused of adultery by the Islamic State. Pictures have emerged showing crowds gathering in the Syrian stronghold of Raqqa as the terror group metes out the punishment under its warped interpretation of Shariah law. The men are made to stand in a circle before being lashed with poles by ISIS fighters as another militant beckons to the crowd while waving the group's sinister black flag. Lashed: Six young men are flogged by ISIS in the Syrian stronghold of Raqqa as children as young as three gather to watch the punishment being handed down under its warped interpretation of Shariah law . Pictures show young children aged from around three to their early teens being forced to watch the flogging . The men were sentenced to 100 lashes for adultery and banished from the self-styled caliphate, which covers a third of Iraq and Syria, for a year, it was reported by www.raqqa-sl.com. Among the crowd are several young children aged from around three to their early teens. They were apparently forced to watch by their parents who appear to be enjoying the spectacle. The site did not elaborate on the details of their alleged crimes. In December, ISIS released a document on social media explaining the rules of its 'penal code', which is being brutally enforced across ISIS-held territory. Entitled 'Clarification [regarding] the Hudud', the document contains a list of the punishments handed out for crimes committed in the Islamic State, in accordance with the extremist group's radical interpretation of Shariah law. All punishments are carried out after a 'trial' at an Islamic State court and, after the sentencing, the prisoner is taken into the centre of the town or city. The men were sentenced to 100 lashes for adultery and banished from the self-styled caliphate for a year . Under ISIS, all punishments are carried out after a 'trial' at an Islamic State court and, after the sentencing, the prisoner is taken into the centre of the town or city for the sentence to be carried out in public . Men and young boys of all ages are actively encouraged to gather and watch the punishments. An ISIS fighter then reads out the charges found against the victim before the punishment is carried out in public. All forms of blasphemy against Islam are punished by execution, even if the accuser chooses to repent of their sins. Likewise, committing murder, spying, apostasy or sodomy is punished by immediate death. Anyone found guilty of banditry, specifically murder and stealing, is put to death by crucifixion. According to Islamic State's reading of Shariah law, thieves have a hand cut off. It is unclear whether the victim can choose which hand is removed. Flogging is another common punishment carried out under Islamic State. According to the document, 80 lashes of the whip is given to anyone who drinks alcohol or is found guilty of committing slander. Normally the whipping is not carried out on bare skin. Footage shows the man sat on a plastic chair, while blindfolded, before being thrown off the tower block . It is believed the man was hurled from the building, at least seven storeys high, as punishment for 'being gay' The punishment of stoning, where heavy rocks are thrown or piled on top of the victim, is ordered for any married man or woman who has committed adultery. A hundred lashes and immediate exile is given to any man or woman who has sex outside of marriage. The flogging pictures emerged as it was revealed ISIS had reportedly blindfolded and man and threw him off a tower block in Syria for ‘being gay’ before being stoned to death after surviving the fall. New images have emerged appearing to show ISIS militants hurling the man off the seven-storey building in the town of Tal Abyad in Raqqa. The man, who was supposedly being punished for having a ‘homosexual affair’, apparently survived the fall, but was stoned to death by a waiting crowd at the foot of the tower block. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, claims the man was thrown from the building before being beaten to death. Photographs of the incident appear to show the man - who is thought to be in his 50s - sat on a white, plastic chair while blindfolded. He is surrounded by at least two masked militants, who are dressed in black clothing and army fatigues. The man is then thrown from the top of the tower block and one photograph shows him falling towards the ground, head first. It is believed a 'judgement' was read aloud before he was thrown, which condemned his sexuality and claimed he should be thrown from the highest point of the city as punishment.","Young men were sentenced to 100 lashes after 'trial' at ISIS Shariah court .

"The star of Selma has slammed the Oscars for rewarding only 'subservient' roles for black cast members in films.

Oyelowo spoke out at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival after he was snubbed for an Oscar nomination for his role despite being lauded by critics. 'Generally speaking, we as black people have been celebrated more for when we are subservient, when we are not being leaders or kings or being in the center of our own narrative, driving it forward,' he said. Scroll down for video .

The British actor added in a video filmed by the Hollywood Reporter: 'We've just got to come to the point whereby there isn't a self-fulfilling prophecy, a notion of who black people are that feeds into what we're celebrated as — not just in the academy, just in life generally. We have been slaves, we have been domestic servants, we have been criminals. We've been all those things. 'But we've been leaders, we've been kings, we've been those who change the world. And those films, where that is the case, are so hard to get made.' 'Why has it taken so long?' I mean, [King] was assassinated almost 50 years ago,' he said. 'There has been no film where Dr. King has been the center of his own narrative until now. That's because up until 12 Years a Slave and The Butler did so well, both critically and at the box office, films like this were told through the eyes of white protagonists because there is a fear of white guilt.'

'So you have a very nice white person who holds black people's hands through their own narrative.' Selma has been nominated in the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Original Song. At the festival Oyelowo defended Benedict Cumberbatch and said that the row over his use of the word ‘coloured’ actually damaged the debate about racism. He said that it was a mistake to just ‘focus on one word’ and that as a result everyone ended up ‘ignoring’ the fact that Cumberbatch was talking about how hard it is for black actors to get roles. Cumberbatch made his gaffe last week in an interview on American TV and afterwards said he was ‘devastated to have caused offence’. Oyelowo said he only believes Selma was possible because film companies noticed the box office success of films such as 12 Years A Slave (pictured) Oyelowo said: ‘Everyone has ended up ignoring the issue Benedict was talking about and focusing on that one word. ‘It’s actually stopped us (from) talking about race’. In Britain, Amanda Berry, the head of Bafta has said the lack of a Bafta nomination was not a 'racist snub'. Ms Berry said in an interview with the Observer  it was because its release was too late to make the shortlist for the awards, which will be handed out at a ceremony next weekend. Oyelowo said 'it would have been nice' if the film was nominated, while on the red carpet at the Curzon Mayfair in London for Selma's premier last week. But Ms Berry, Bafta's chief executive, said: 'I get quite upset when people say it was a racist snub. The film wasn't delivered until the end of November and there were only three screenings before the voting started. Last year we flew David in to present and we absolutely recognised his talent.' Benedict Cumberbatch described black people as 'colored'.  Oyelowo  said that it was a mistake to just ‘focus on one word’ and that as a result everyone ended up ‘ignoring’ the fact that Cumberbatch was talking about how hard it is for black actors to get roles. Above, the actor during his TV interview . Asked how he felt about the lack of recognition, Oyelowo said: 'You're going to have to ask Bafta about that. I don't know, it would have been nice. 'But the fact of the matter is the film is really resonating with audiences. It's great to be back here in the UK premiering the film. 'I did my bit.' Ms Berry also told the paper the film industry should be as diverse as possible amid an ongoing debate about opportunities for actors from ethnic and working class backgrounds. 'It is essential the industry is open to all. The industry we work in has to reflect the society we live in. That is really important,' she said. 'There is a perception that if you are from an ethnic background you have no chance.

"Polygamist reality TV star Kody Brown has traded  his 'official' wife for the youngest of his four 'spiritual' brides. Kody appears to live in marital bliss with his four wives Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn and their 17 children on TLC's show Sister Wives. The polygamist was only legally wed to Meri after their wedding in 1990, while the the next three were 'spiritual' or 'sister' marriages. But it has now emerged that his first wife  has become his first ex-wife after he divorced Meri Brown last September. Scroll down for video . Kody Brown appears to live in marital bliss with his four 'wives' Meri (second from left), Janelle (far right), Christine (second from right) and Robyn (far left)  on TLC's Sister Wives . The extended Brown family last year: Kody holds son Solomon, his biological child with Robyn. Fourth wife Robyn is in the black dress at back. First wife Meri is in green and white. The four wives have 17 children . And within just three months of the divorce, he had tied the knot with  wife Robyn, the youngest and most recent addition to the group. Meri has decided to stay with Kody and his polygamist family as a spiritual wife. According to records, the 44-year-old family head and his wife of 20 years jointly petitioned for divorce which was finalized on September 25, 2014. It is believed that Kody wanted to bring Robyn's three kids from a previous marriage better into the family, where they'll have more security. She has a son Dayton and two daughters, Breanna and Aurora, from her first marriage, and her fourth child, son Solomon, is her only biological son with Kody. On the show, all of Robyn's children refer to Kody as 'dad' and are referred to as Kody's children. Their biological father is alive and Robyn is divorced from him. On one episode of the show she tearfully revealed she as left the marriage and was driven to financial ruin getting out of it it. She also revealed her first child, Dayton, 15, was conceived out of wedlock despite her strong conservative beliefs. She then married his father and they had two more kids before divorcing.

It is understood Kody is marrying Robyn legally to offer more stability to her three children from her first marriage. They are pictured here in 2010, before the couple's son Solomon was born . Solomon was born at home in Robyn and Kody's Las Vegas bedroom in 2011, a year after the couple wed in Utah. As a Christmas present for Kody in 2013, Robyn legally changed her name to Robyn Brown from Robyn Sullivan. The Brown family now lives in four neighboring homes, custom built, in a cul-de-sac in Las Vegas. Kody wed his first three wives in quick succession. He and Meri legally and spiritually wed in 1990, he and Janelle spiritually wed in 1993 and he and Christine were married in 1994. None of the children by his first three wives remember a time when their other two 'moms' were not part of the family. He has one child with Meri and six with Janelle and six and with Christine. After a long period with no new wives, there was obvious friction, captured by the television cameras on the first season of Sister Wives, when Kody decided to court and then marry Robyn, bringing her and her three children into the already bursting household. But no wife was more supportive than Meri, who also is the closest to Robyn. Meri, who struggled with fertility and only has one biological child, made no secret of always yearning for more children in the family. She encouraged Kody to court Robyn. The whole family isn't just married, they also work together for their online business, My Sister Wives Closet, which sells jewelry and knickknacks. Within three months of divorcing Meri (left) he had married the youngest of his four 'spiritual wives' Robyn (right) Some fans have expressed shock and sympathy for Meri online, but the decision is more likely to be legal maneuver due to the fact that it is still illegal to officially be married to more than one person. Kody and his wives first appeared in Sister Wives in 2010 and said at the time they hoped the show to make the public more aware of polygamist families and to combat societal prejudices. All his wives except Janelle were raised in polygamist families. But, Janelle's mother went on to become a polygamist after her daughter, and is now in a plural marriage with Kody's dad . The series led to the Brown family being investigated for possible prosecution although Kody believes his polygamist arrangement is legal because he is legally married only to one woman, and the other marriages are spiritual unions. The Brown family belongs to the Apostolic United Brethren- a polygamous Mormon fundamentalist church within the Latter Day Saint movement. No word yet if the divorce and new legal marriage will feature on future episodes of the family's TLC show. Meri encouraged Kody's courtship of and marriage to his fourth wife Robyn. Here, a still from their wedding reception which aired on TLC's SIster Wives. The ceremony itself was 'too sacred' for television .","Kody Brown stars in TLC's Sister Wives with his four 'wives' and children .

"The three children of  Robin Williams do not want to get dragged into a legal battle over the estate of their late father. Zak, 31, Zelda, 25, and Cody, 22 made a statement to NBC News through attorney Allan Mayer in regards to the battle with the late comedian's widow Susan Schneider over his personal possessions. The statement began: 'Robin's children want nothing more than to be left alone to grieve. 'The fact is that they have been barred from what had been their father's house, and not even the trustees of the Robin Williams Trust have been able to conduct a complete inventory.' Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Robin Williams' widow Susan Schneider (pictured here in November 2009) is fighting his three children over personal property left in the late comedian's will, according to reports . On Monday it was reported by TMZ that Schneider and Williams' children have filed opposing court documents in a bitter legal dispute over his estate. Schneider has complained in the documents that, in the days after Williams' suicide last August, someone entered their California home and removed belongings that she felt entitled to. And once she started legal proceedings, 'certain home-related services were canceled', including a newspaper delivery, she said in the documents, which were filed in December and January, according to The New York Times. In their statement through their attorney Mayer, the children of the Mrs. Doubtfire actor responded to these claims: 'The insinuation that they or their representatives may have taken anything from the house is both despicable and wholly untrue.' They have also accused Schneider of attempting to 'money grab' and ignore the 'plain language of his will and trust', TMZ reported. His children acknowledge Schneider has the right to keep items that she accumulated during her marriage, but believe she is trying to alter some of the terms listed in the will. Dispute: Zelda Williams, left in 2009 and right in 2006, and her brother Cody, right, are at the center of a lawsuit from their father's third wife Susan Schneider. They claim she is trying to change the language of his will . Sources say his children believe Schneider is trying to 'redefine' aspects of the will to suit her, despite Williams being clear in his will that he left behind most of his property to his children. According to the site, they claim she is trying to 'redefine the word jewelry' so that she can keep his watch collection, which the children say they are entitled to. Some of the items left to the three children also include his 1998 Oscar for the movie Good Will Hunting, as well as other memorabilia from his films. Williams, 63, was found dead in the $7 million home in Tiburon, Marin Country, that he shared with Schneider in August. After two failed marriages, which reportedly cost him $30 million, Williams ensured that he and his third wife Schneider signed a prenup agreement. The report in The New York Times revealed that Schneider's papers assert as she lost 'her husband through a shocking and emotionally charged event,' she had not been 'given time to grieve her loss free from the frenetic efforts to interfere with her domestic tranquility'. MailOnline has reached out for comment to representatives for the family who have so far been unavailable for comment.

"It used to only come between two sesame buns and surrounded by the ubiquitous McDonald's beef patty - but now Big Mac sauce is available in bottle for the first time. However, so far only one 16oz container of the sauce has been put on sale - and it'll set the buyer back at least $18,000. The fast food giant made the decision to release the sauce outside of a Big Mac order to raise funds for its charity arm in Australia. Scroll down for video . Saucy: An online auction of the chain's first sale-able bottle of Big Mac sauce have attracted bids of 23,000 Australian dollars, or $18,000 . 'Improves everything': An eBay listing for the sauce suggests it is the ultimate condiment . Australia only: The sauce, which McDonald's said lots of people have asked about, will also be available to high online bidders . Bidders in the country have piled in on an eBay listing to get the chance to use the sauce themselves, buoyed by claims it can improve any dish - even cupcakes. Offers for the bottle - set to be one of 200 - have exceeded 23,000 Australian dollars, or $18,000. The eBay listing touts the exclusivity of the product, and says it will overshadow all other condiments. It says: 'This bottle is #1 of only 200 being produced worldwide, and they won’t be sold in restaurants. That makes it rarer than a spot on Bondi beach on New Years Day. 'So slide the mustard, mayo and tomato sauce to the back of the fridge – because everything tastes better when it tastes like the Big Mac.' The proceeds of the sale will go to Ronald McDonald House Charities, which help ill children and their families. Less wealthy Australians will also be able to get their hands on the sauce. Each of the country's 920 outlets have been given 600 small tubs of the sauce, weighing in at just under an ounce each. The contents of Big Mac sauce have long been touted as a secret. But in 2012, the chain's executive chef in Canada made a video showing people how to whip up their own. According to the clip, which has 4million views on YouTube, the ingredients are mayonnaise, sweet pickle relish, yellow mustard, white wine vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika. The auction comes as McDonald's has been struggling with sliding profits in recent months. Changing tastes - which see the likes of Chipotle and Shake Shack surge in popularity - have hit the retailer's customer base. Food safety scares in Asia have also harmed the bottom line. Since the slump, McDonald's has responded with a number of feel-good initiatives, such as this charity push. In the United States, the chain is offering some customers free food if they smile, dance or hug at the checkout during February, a promotion it announced in its Super Bowl ad.

"An anti-Semitic job advert looking for a computer graphics designer who is 'not Jewish if possible' has sparked outrage after appearing on a French website. The advert appeared on specialist jobs site www.graphic-jobs.com for 35 minutes on Monday, apparently posted by Parisian design agency NSL Studio. But NSL Studio has since moved to distance itself from the advert - which was quickly taken down from the site - claiming it had been hacked on the company's Twitter account. A tweet from French newspaper Le Pont, showing the advert - which includes the stipulation 'if possible, no Jews' In a statement on its website, NSL Studio revealed it had filed a complaint with Paris' prosecutor, saying it 'strongly condemned' the anti-Semitic sentiment in the advert, which also asked for applicants to be motivated, well-organised and with three to four years experience. 'NSL Studio is an agency of integrity that does not discriminate,' it said, adding: 'The person in charge of the ad will be questioned, a probe launched and the necessary measures taken if it turns out that it really came from us.' The specialised jobs website, meanwhile, has apologised, saying its moderators had failed to notice the ad for around 35 minutes before it was deleted. The advert - which came less than a month after the attacks at a Jewish deli which left four people dead, two days after the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo offices - was roundly criticised on Twitter. SOS Racisme spokeswoman Aline Kremer said: 'This is a proven case of public discrimination based on the real or supposed belonging to a race, ethnic group or religion, which is punishable by law.' NSL Studio has denied it had posted the anti-Semetic description - taking to Twitter to explain it had been hacked (pictured) The Jewish community has been targeted in several attacks since four people were killed at a Jewish deli in January - including today, when three French soldiers were attacked and wounded in a knife attack in Nice outside a Jewish community centre . The advert's appearance will no doubt pour fuel on existing tensions in France. Jewish communities called for extra protection the in the wake of January's attacks, which left a total of 17 people dead, including the four in the Jewish deli. Then today, three soldiers guarding a Jewish community centre in Nice were stabbed by a 'suspected jihadist'. Some Jewish leaders have been advising Jews living in Europe to consider relocating to Israel, in the belief the continent is no longer safe for their community. The deli was targeted on purpose - and has led to fears anti-Semtitism is on the rise in Europe. Pictured: Relatives of Yoav Hattab, a victim of the attack on the kosher deli in Paris, gather for his funeral procession in the city of Bnei Brak near Tel Aviv, Israel, ahead of his burial at a cemetery in Jerusalem . Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, seen here speaking at the funerals, has said Israel would welcome Jews from Europe to Israel . Speaking at Paris' Great Synagogue two days after the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: 'But Jews of our time have been blessed with another right, a right that did not exist for previous generations of Jews: the right to join their Jewish brothers and sisters in our historic homeland... 'Any Jew who wishes to immigrate to Israel will be welcomed with open arms and warm and accepting hearts.' Meanwhile, French counter-terrorism experts have identified 64 suburbs in dozens of cities that act as breeding grounds for Islamic extremism. The French government also believes that around 400 French citizens have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside militants from the Islamic State terror group.","Anti-Semitic job advert appeared on a specialist French website on Monday .

"Even by the Islamic State's barbaric standards, the terror group's latest execution video has reached a truly depraved new low. The footage shows Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh being burnt alive in scenes that are far too shocking to even consider publishing. As with previous beheading videos featuring British executioner Jihadi John, the 20-minute-long clip is characterised by its slick production values and graphics. But unlike the others, it contains an added cinematic dimension designed to achieve unparalleled impact on the viewer - as if the horror of watching someone torched to death wasn't enough. ISIS blames the F-16 fighter pilot  for burning houses - and killing babies - with airstrikes before he was captured in December. The manner of his death is a symbolic show of strength to strike terror into 'non-believers' and encourage recruits or doubters within their ranks in equal measure. Scroll down for video . Horror: The video, which is ISIS' most sickening yet, begins by showing Kasasbeh being paraded in front of heavily armed men wearing combat fatigues and yellow masks . Walking to his death: The professionally shot and edited footage shows Moaz al-Kasasbeh walking towards the cage in which he would be burnt alive . Dr Andreas Krieg, assistant professor for defence studies at King's College London in Qatar, told MailOnline: 'This is a new dimension of brutality, but ISIS had to evolve stylistically from beheadings. 'The global public got more or less used to it. ISIS shows innovation in finding new means of psychological warfare or terrorism. 'Considering the Jordanian public's emotional involvement in this case, this is not just a cruel execution, but an act of terror that is going to hit right into the hearts and minds of the Jordanian people. 'The helplessness of the victim, the viciousness and thought with which the fire was arranged make the video unwatchable. 'It is similar to the first time the world saw beheadings. It is psychological shock and awe delivered through the power of imagery. 'It's like a sickening game show. Everything is so pre-arranged and planned - just the contestant has no chance to escape. It is a new level of terror.' The title of the video - Healing the Believers' Chests - is also revealing. It is thought to refer to 'giving them pleasure' - an obvious statement of revenge. Barbaric: An ISIS extremist lights a trail of petrol leading to the cage in which the 26-year-old stands . Depraved: The flames reach the cage holding the helpless pilot. It is later flattened by a bulldozer . Whereas the Jihadi John videos were often static - showing the executioner standing behind his victims - this video features a slick combination of aerial shots, panoramic views and changing camera angles that would have taken far longer to edit. Reports coming out from Jordan suggest al-Kaseasbeh may have died as long ago as January 3, suggesting the finished video has been a month in the planning. The new video also contains far more of the landscape than has previously been shown that intelligence experts will be frantically analysing for clues to the whereabouts of the jihadists. The video, which is ISIS' most sickening yet, begins with a lengthy montage showing Jordan's King Abdullah II declaring his support for the anti-ISIS coalition in the style of a TV news report. Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have released a video they claim shows Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh being burned alive while locked in a cage . Brutal: The footage, which is titled 'Healing the Believers Chests' appears to show the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is seen being set alight . Captured: Muath al-Kasasbeh (centre in white) was captured by the Islamic State after after crashing near its HQ in the Syrian city of Raqqa in December. ISIS is now believed to brutally murdered him . It then cuts to beaten and bruised-looking Kasasbeh sitting in a darkened room wearing an orange jump suit and giving details of his training as a pilot, the anti-ISIS airstrikes he took part in, and details of the crash in which his F-16 jet came down in jihadi-held territory. His commentary is preceded and interspersed by slick graphics including one showing an F-16 fight jet being smashed into tiny pieces. Another segue features a crying baby over images of infants ISIS claims were injured and killed in airstrikes by Jordan. Kasasbeh is then paraded in front of heavily armed men wearing combat fatigues and yellow masks. The pilot's face looks swollen, heavily bruised and bloody in places - no doubt from repeat beatings by the terrorists from the moment of his capture. Al-Kasasbeh is later seen walking towards the cage in which he would be burnt alive. Whereas the Jihadi John videos were often static - showing the executioner standing behind his victims - the latest video features a slick combination of aerial shots, panoramic views and changing camera angles . It then switches to an aerial shot showing the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is seen being set alight. The enormous flames quickly engulf the pilot, who is seen battling them for more than a minute before falling to his knees and putting up no further resistance. He remains alive for at least another 30 seconds, however, before falling backwards on to the floor of the cage. The images are far too distressing to publish. The Sunni Muslim extremist group had threatened to kill Kasasbeh unless Jordan handed over a jailed Iraqi female suicide bomber, but the deal collapsed. The release of the video of the pilot's purported murder came days after ISIS beheaded a second Japanese hostage within a week. ISIS had vowed to kill the second Japanese man, Kenji Goto, and Kasasbeh by sunset on January 29 unless Amman handed over Iraqi jihadist and would-be suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi, who is on death row in Jordan.","20-minute clip contains cinematic dimension never before seen from ISIS .

"Thief: Building society cashier Adrienne Wells, 23, has been jailed after stealing from elderly savers . A crooked cashier who stole £40,000 from pensioners' savings has been jailed after she was exposed by two victims in their 90s. Adrienne Wells hoped her victims would think they had 'lost their marbles' and spent the money - which is what two of them, aged 94 and 96, said they were told when they alerted building society staff. But the elderly pair refused to back down, and Wells was eventually brought to justice with her cocaine and drink habit exposed. The 23-year-old stole £40,000 from the accounts of five Derbyshire Building Society customers between May and November 2013, Derby Crown Court heard. She looked for the savings of people who rarely withdrew money, suggesting they had forgotten about them. That was until sharp-eyed Doris Cash, 94, spotted £20,000 missing from her account. She knew she had not spent the money because it was set aside for her funeral. Although the retired barmaid used a wheelchair, she insisted on being taken to a branch near her Derby home to question the withdrawal. Ms Cash has since died but her nephew Philip Elmore, 61, said the building society 'kept insisting' his aunt had withdrawn the money. 'This woman did a lot of harm and will be inside for six months but if you asked people if they would do six months in prison for £40,000, they would queue up,' he added. 'It'll be like going into a holiday camp.' He said he did not blame his aunt's death on Wells' thefts but said 'it didn't help'. He added: 'It was always on her mind and she went into hospital three times.' Jim Hunt, a 96-year-old widower, also saw £2,200 was missing when he received an annual statement in March 2014 - but said staff denied responsibility to him too. 'They claimed I had lost my marbles and that I'd spent it,' he said. 'I could not understand how this had happened because I had my paying-in books at home. 'I didn't even know you could withdraw money from a building society without the books. 'I was not very happy at all when they kept saying I had lost my marbles and spent it. Helpless: Two victims said staff at the building society insisted they spent the cash by mistake (file photo) 'They kept saying to my daughter that she needed to jog my memory. 'But they were just messing about and keeping it hush-hush until they finally came out and said where it had gone.' Mr Hunt's daughter, Lois Hunt, 60, a nurse, said: 'The building society were basically saying he was gaga and didn't know he had the money. 'But this was the work of a despicable young woman in a position of trust, taking advantage of the elderly and vulnerable.' Wells, pictured in her mugshot, was described as a 'despicable young woman in a position of trust' Wells, of Holbrook, Derbyshire was jailed for 12 months yesterday for taking a total of £40,000 from customers' accounts. She will spend half the sentence in prison. The court heard she had no assets to her name but claimed to have given £3,000 to her boyfriend. Police asked him for a statement on this but he failed to make one. Wells also claimed to have handed more than £6,000 to a village pub. This has now closed and the former landlady said it was a £1,000 loan which had been repaid. Other enquiries had been made into all Wells' cash claims but Judge Ebrahim Mooncey said: 'That still remains a mystery.' The court heard she had spent thousands of pounds of the money 'on drink and drugs'. Quentin Robbins, in mitigation, said Wells was in the grip of cocaine and alcohol at the time but was now clear of both drugs. He added: 'She realises the hurt and distress she has caused as a result of her offending.' The Derbyshire Building Society was bought out last year and is now part of Nationwide. A spokesman said: 'Employee fraud is extremely rare, but where it does happen, we take it very seriously, treating victims fairly and ensuring that those affected are not financially disadvantaged. 'In this particular case, we took action as soon as we were alerted to the situation. 'The suggestion that our branch staff were not taking customer concerns seriously is not a behaviour we recognise amongst our employees who pride themselves on excellent customer service. 'We have a policy in place for the management of vulnerable customers who have the potential to become victims of financial crime and this is regularly communicated to our employees.'","Adrienne Wells siphoned cash from Derbyshire Building Society accounts .

"A grandfather who knew his Frozen-loving granddaughter was disappointed when it failed to snow as much as forecasters had predicted delivered her a truck of snow so she could build a snowman. Allen Queen, from Providence, Rhode Island, had the idea after his home was battered with winter weather, pushing back a trip to see his four-year-old granddaughter in Glen Burnie, Maryland. The little girl, Sophia White, had been sad that she hadn't received as much snow as her grandfather, her mother Nicole told the Capital Gazette. Dream come true: Four-year-old Sophia White is pictured with the snowman she built in Maryland after her kind-hearted grandfather delivered her a truck of snow that he drove from his home in Rhode Island . 'As the storm came, or rather didn't come, and I was talking to my dad on the phone I casually mentioned to him that I wished I could teleport Sophia up to him with his 18 inches of snow since all she wanted to do was build a snowman,' she said. So the kindhearted grandfather, known to his granddaughter as 'Poppy', borrowed a front-loader from his employer  and used it to fill the bed of his truck with snow. Then he started the nearly 400 mile journey south. 'When he got here, he had a tarp over the back of his truck, and I kept asking what was in the back,' White said. 'He just kept telling me not to worry about it - it was something for work.' He had planned to surprise Sophia right away but when he arrived, the area was being battered by rain and he didn't want her experience to be ruined - so he waited until the skies cleared. Good thinking: Allen Queen used his employer's front loader to fill up the bed of his truck with snow after learning that his granddaughter was disappointed that she couldn't build a snowman in Maryland . Surprise! After driving nearly 400 miles, he shoveled it out onto her lawn with the help of her father . When he finally told White, she put Sophia in her Elsa costume from the movie 'Frozen' and allowed the youngster to stay home from school so that she could play in the snow. With the help of Sophia's father, Julius White, Queen shoveled out the snow and the little girl could finally get to work on her snowman. 'Everything else in the neighborhood has melted and is pretty dry,' White said. 'Then there's just this random snowman in our yard. He's a little shorter than he was, but he's still there.' Glen Burnie received an inch of snow during last week's snowstorm, while Providence was lumped with more than a foot.

"A one-armed man whose missing limb was severed from the shoulder in a freak biking accident has invented a prosthetic replacement which enables him to fly a plane. Steven Robinson's right arm was torn off by another rider's foot peg during a collision over 30 years ago, and attempts to reattach his limb proved unsuccessful. Since his crash, Mr Robinson, 51, has never worn a prosthetic arm but he realised he would need one if he wanted accomplish his lifelong dream of earning his private flying licence. Scroll down for video . Steven Robinson, pictured at the controls of a plane, is ready to earn his solo flying licence after designing and building a prosthetic limb specifically for the job . Mr Robinson shows off his creation while sitting at the controls of a private fixed-wing plane . Here he is pictured aged 18, not long before his arm was completely severed during the freak biking accident . Despite trying out several types of prosthetics from the NHS, the motivational speaker soon discovered they weren't going to do the job, so he set out to make his own - designing and building it all from scratch. Now, after almost a year hard at work, Mr Robinson, who fixes vintage jukeboxes in his spare time, has a working prototype which was signed off by an aviation medical examiner two weeks ago. This means he will be able finally get his solo flying hours and, all being well, his licence. At the age of 18 in 1982, a mid-air crash on his bike left him critically injured with damaged lungs, spleen and liver, a broken leg and most crucially - a severed arm. His torn-off limb was found 100 metres away, too damaged to be reattached, and his missing body part changed his life forever. Mr Robinson, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: 'The day of the accident was the day my life changed for ever, but surprisingly it was a positive thing. As I lay in hospital I'd been told I'd lost my arm but I didn't believe it as I could still ""feel"" it. The unique prosthetic flying arm (pictured) created by Mr Robinson was constructed out of aluminium and has a special jacket which he claims makes him look like RoboCop . The prosthetic limb was specifically designed to be used to operate a plane. While he could fly one-armed as a co-pilot, he needed a functional second arm to fly solo . 'It wasn't until a nurse took me into the bathroom for the first time that I realised the truth. But, as I looked in the mirror a wave of euphoria washed over me. 'I walked out of that bathroom a new person. I had gone in as a spotty, ugly, shy, boy with no  confidence and walked out as a strong young man who had already survived against all the odds.' As a young man he had been so afraid of flying he needed a course of hypnotherapy to board a plane. But on a whim following the accident, he applied to the Flying Scholarships for Disabled People (FSDP) - and in 2012, was accepted. However, when he started flying in 2012, the prosthetic limb he was using fell off each time he tried to operate the joystick, making flying as a one-armed pilot impossible. Undaunted, he scrapped the false arm, and decided he would solve the problem himself. He suspended his lessons until he could make himself a new arm that was up to the job. He tried out two arms the NHS had given him but found he couldn't use them to fly. He had flown co-pilot for several months without a prosthetic, but he needed the new arm to fly solo. Mr Robinson believes that a number of 'unique features' make his £200 arm stand out from anything else at present. Mr Robinson pictured working as a mechanic in the first few years after losing his arm . As a young man, Mr Robinson (pictured left and right) was motorbike-mad. But in 1982, a mid-air crash on his bike left him critically injured with damaged lungs, spleen and liver, a broken leg and a severed arm . A prosthetic arm given to Mr Robinson by the NHS (pictured) kept falling off while he was flying, so he solved the problem by building his own . He said: 'I basically bought a milling machine and a lathe and started making components out of aluminium and putting them together. 'It has all been made by me, nothing is shop bought. I actually had to design some parts because they didn't exist before. 'It has a very special shoulder socket that I have a patent on now, I also had to design a special jacket so that arm can fit over it. It looks pretty impressive. I look a bit like RoboCop.' He explained that his arm has a quick-release shoulder socket, which means if he gets in trouble he can unattached it quickly. 'People don't think about getting out of them quickly but you don't want to be stuck if you are in trouble in a plane. It also has positive locking on the shoulder and it can fully rotate as well.' Mr Robinson said the unique arm took him around 12 months to put together - but he took his time as he was hoping the arms on offer by the NHS might have fit the bill. Mr Robinson now works as a motivational speaker and says: 'If I can achieve all of these things with one arm, what are you capable of achieving with two?' He added: 'I've spoken to lots of different groups about how everyone is capable of overcoming obstacles and building their own future. 'I say to them, if I can achieve all of these things with one arm, what are you capable of achieving with two?' 'I've met people who had obstacles in their way which didn't exist, just like my right arm. It's just a question of overcoming them. 'With passion, determination and the right attitude you can achieve anything you put your mind to.' Mr Robinson now needs to fly ten hours solo and carry out various navigation tests before he is a fully qualified pilot.","Steven Robinson's right arm was severed in a freak bike accident aged 18 .

"An amateur photographer claims is being haunted by a ghost which emits a peculiar smell of fish just before tragedy is about to strike someone she knows. Laura Dickson, 27, of Sittingbourne, Kent, claims she has smelt the fishy odour on a number of indications before something bad has happened - such as a family friend dying or her grandmother being taken into hospital. But rather than fear the spectre, which has stalked her for 10 years, and its distinctive smell Miss Dickson has now come to accept it and takes the aroma as a clear warning to be on her guard. It also inspired her to become a ghost hunter and she has used her enthusiasm for photography to capture spectres on film - even photographing what she believes is the ghost of a monk in Kent. Scroll down for video . Laura Dickson, 27, who has become a ghost hunter, claims she is haunted by a ghost that has a distinctive fishy smell, which appears as a warning before tragedy is about to strike someone she knows . 'The pong always appeared right before something bad happened,' she said. 'Ever since I was little, I've sensed spirits around me. I'd pick up on presences in the room and the fishy smell would come as a warning.' The ill-scented encounters started when Miss Dickson was around nine or 10 and shortly afterwards a relative was rushed into hospital after suffering a stroke. She said: 'In a way, the spirits' whiffy warning had helped prepare me.' It was this episode which prompted Miss Dickson to work as a ghost hunter – one of the UK's only female stalkers. 'I often visited old buildings to take photos. Miss Dickson said she believes this picture has captured an image of a ghost of a monk in a church window . 'I noticed a number of my pictures were covered in light orbs. 'When I researched it online, I learnt that some people believe it indicates a spirit present in the picture. 'This made me think, 'I'm going to catch more than light orbs'. 'So I continued scouring old buildings, snapping away.' In January last year Miss Dickson, who works as a machinist, was taking pictures of St Peter and St Paul church in Borden, Kent, when she captured a mysterious image. The amateur photographer took up ghost hunting after the 'smelly ghost' seemed to be warning her . Miss Dickson said she picks up presences in a room and the fishy smells then come as a warning to her . Since starting to hunt for ghosts Miss Dickson has become determined to capture more images of spectres . She said: 'In one of the pictures, a ghostly figure was standing in the window of the church. 'I glance up and the ghost had disappeared. 'I made my way home and uploaded the pictures onto my laptop. 'As I zoomed into the image I noticed it looked like a monk. 'I did some research and discovered the church was founded by monks hundreds of years ago. In this photo, taken in 2011, Miss Dickson said there is an image of a girl in top right corner and some orbs . 'I realised it must have been haunted by them and I'd caught one on camera. 'I couldn't believe I'd managed it. 'But I know it's a real ghost. 'And it's just made me even more determined to catch spirits on camera. 'I suppose you could call me a real-life ghost hunter.' And in 2011 Miss Dickson claims she took a photo at Hastings Museum which captured an image of a girl, with orbs in the top right hand corner.","Laura Dickson claims she is haunted by a ghost that has a fishy odour .

"Sarah Willis is accused of stabbing her Muslim boyfriend to death after a volatile relationship that saw the pair arguing about her Westernised clothes . A teenager is accused of stabbing her Muslim boyfriend to death after the pair argued about her wearing Westernised tight clothing and short dresses and skirts. Sarah Willis, who works at a law firm, is accused of stabbing Bilal Saddique in the leg at the home they shared in Blackburn in Lancashire. The knife almost entirely severed an artery in the 29-year-old's thigh and he died an hour later. Willis, 19, claimed Mr Saddique was a controlling man and had taunted her with claims that he had slept with someone else during their stormy three-year relationship. Mr Saddique, a strict Muslim, had kept their relationship and had referred to his girlfriend as a 'bitch' and a 'slag', Preston Crown Court. On the night of his death during a vicious argument between the pair Willis said Mr Saddique pulled her by her hair and taunted her by saying he had been having sex with someone else. When she started collecting her possessions, including knives, to leave their shared home he goaded her and dared her to stab him, saying 'come on hit me, come on f****** stab me, if you hate me'. As a vicious row ensued Willis said the BT engineer grabbed her hand, which was holding a knife, and stabbed himself in the thigh. He died at Royal Blackburn Hospital an hour later from his injuries. Willis, who converted to Islam when she was at school, regularly talked about her boyfriend according to colleagues. She sometimes told them he had bought her expensive handbags and makeup but at other times would complain about him being too controlling. Asma Day, a colleague, described Willis as having a split personality - sometimes being loud and disruptive and other times withdrawn. She said: 'He wanted her to cover up because other men looked at her. She wore Western clothing but always covered her arms and legs. She said she had never been introduced to Bilal's mother and she was conservative and wouldn't accept her. She said they loved each other and were going to get married. He didn't like her wearing tight clothing and short clothes.' On one occasion when Mr Saddique was away in Pakistan Willis was seen wearing 'bright lips' and more revealing and glamorous clothes and had appeared happy and 'less disruptive.' The court heard Mr Saddique had been in contact with a former girlfriend who said he was not aggressive in their relationship. Mr Saddique had told the woman his relationship with Willis was 'beset by arguments' but that he had intended to marry her despite not having introduced her to his family. He would refer to Willis as 'slag' and 'bitch' and from time to time would block contact with her on his phone. He also became suspicious of her platonic friendship with a male work colleague after they were photographed together at the office Christmas party in 2013 and he found text messages and read her Facebook account. Willis claimed Mr Saddique was controlling and the court heard he had kept their relationship private . On August 18 Mr Saddique went to pick up Willis from work only to see the man drive away at the same time and a vicious argument ensued. Willis said when they got home she started to gather up her belongings - including a shower panel she had bought. But her actions further angered Mr Saddique and he started dragging her by her hair and tried to carry her down the stairs. Willis went on her own accord and started to take some of her possessions from the kitchen - including a set of knives. Prosecuting, Francis McIntee said: 'She said against a background of arguments whilst she was collecting the knives he taunted her that he had slept with a woman. He said he had slept with her and had done so on a number of occasions including as recently as the past week.' During this exchange Mr Saddique, it is claimed, goaded Willis to hit or stab him. Willis says she phoned police after Saddique grabbed a knife she was holding and thrust it into his own leg . He was injured after he grabbed Willis' hand as she held one of the kitchen knives, and ended up stabbing. The wound almost severed his femoral artery completely and cut into the femoral vein. Willis phoned emergency services and begged for help and an hour later Mr Saddique was pronounced dead at Royal Blackburn Hospital. Mr McIntee added: 'The prosecution do not allege that the defendant intended to kill Bilal Saddique - the evidence shows that the stabbing occurred in the heat of the moment. Sarah Willis (centre) is on trial at Preston Crown Court . 'But the defendant lashed out with a kitchen knife intending to cause really serious harm. It was driven deep into Mr Saddique's thigh, we say in an act of anger.' Willis called 999 and was heard screaming down the phone. As paramedics arrived Willis told one: 'Help me my boyfriend is bleeding to death - we had an argument and he's been stabbed' and was seen to be 'extremely distressed, almost in a daze' with blood on her clothing and hands. When she was arrested she told police: 'We had an argument, had a bit of a fight. I grabbed a knife and then he grabbed it off me then he grabbed it and stabbed himself. I can't believe this has happened, all over a stupid argument. If anything happens to him I will kill myself'. Neighbour Paul Etherington a hospital operating theatre practitioner, said: 'I first noticed her on her phone, sort of hysterical, crying and shouting for help. I shouted 'what's happened' and then she said: 'help he's bleeding' and ran back into the house. Mr McIntee added: 'She had adopted the Islamic religion when a schoolgirl and was clearly keen to comply with Muslim standards of dress and chose not to show her arms or legs. But there had been culture difficulty in introducing the defendant to Mr Saddique's family and neither he or her had met their respective partner's parents. Willis, of Blackburn, is accused of murder and an alternate charge of manslaughter. She has denied both allegations. The trial continues.

"Imagine waking up after a big night out to find you've run out of headache pills, there isn't any food in the kitchen and, to your horror, the loo roll holder is empty. It's a nightmare! But one clever - teetotal - couple from Swindon, Wiltshire, has found a way to ease the woes of those feeling a bit worse for wear with The Hangover Man. Luke Chequer, 28, and his fiancee 27-year-old Charlotte Broadbridge's service promises to make the morning after less of a headache - by delivering food, drink, and essentials straight to the door for a £5 fee. Right to the doorstep: The Hangover Man delivery service is the brainchild of Luke Chequer (pictured) Mr Chequer, who is teetotal and his fiancee Charlotte Broadbridge promise a doorstep delivery of whatever you crave - but can't face leaving the house to get yourself . The Hangover Man service will save customers a painful journey to McDonald's for a bacon and egg McMuffin or coffee from Costa. They will deliver painkillers for headaches, Alka Seltzer to calm the stomach and even toilet roll if you've been caught short. Or they could get you a fry-up food from a local cafe or even more alcohol if you were so inclined. Mr Chequer and Ms Broadbridge charge a flat £5 delivery charge on top of the cost of the order. Their business took off on social media with more than 3,000 'likes' on Facebook in 48 hours - a week before they even opened. The father-of-two said they struggled to meet demand in their first weekend and had to extend delivery hours and recruit a friend to help. The couple's Facebook page received nearly 3,500 likes in 48 hours . He said: 'Everyone knows what it's like after you've been out on a big one, you don't want to leave the house but you're desperate for your cooked breakfast or McDonald's. 'You can't find the paracetamol and you've run out of loo paper.' The couple said their start-up costs were around £500, with a couple of hundred quid's worth of stock, a few card readers and a tank of fuel. Mr Chequer added: 'I thought it would start off quite small, just with our friends and family. 'I don't think we expected quite so many people to be interested quite so quickly. There seems to be just too much demand for one person to deliver. It has gone viral.' McDonald's topped the delivery requests when the enterprising couple launched this last weekend. But they were surprised by the number of people ordering who did not have hangovers. Mr Chequer with The Hangover Man pamphlets. The teetotal 28-year-old launched his business with £500 . 'I expected a lot of 20-somethings with money to burn who were going out at the weekends but I had orders from everyone. 'I had orders from people who hadn't even been out the night before but who are just lazy. 'I had mums in their 40s and 50s ordering for their teenagers who were still in bed after being out the night before. 'I had families who were really excited and just wanted to do it because it was something new,' he continued. Customers can even pay for their orders by card - an important feature as many have run out of cash the night before. The couple, who have two children and are due to marry in August, are already planning to expand the business into a seven-day operation and into the evening. The service also discourages people from driving after a heavy night's drinking. 'There really is no excuse to drink-drive the morning after if you can have it delivered straight to your door, and that has to be a good thing,' Mr Chequer said. But this isn't Britain's first morning-after delivery service . Alex Howsam's One Delivery franchise in Stockon delivers meals from McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Express and Burger King straight to the sofa - adding a 20 per cent mark-up cost on top of the food price. The 31-year-old's business even offers Sunday roasts from local pub The Penny Black, in Hartburn, Stockton.","Luke Chequer and Charlotte Broadbridge started The Hangover Man .

"Four people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a young man was stabbed to death in a street fight between two sets of motorists. The man, named locally as Daniel Sommerville, was knifed after a brawl broke out between the occupants of a black Vauxhall Corsa and a dark coloured van yesterday afternoon. The two groups involved were understood to have known each other previous to the fight and Mr Sommerville, aged in his 20s, was rushed to hospital in the van with severe stab wounds, but died a short while later. A police forensics officer works at the scene of the stabbing in Guildford following the death . The area remained cordoned off last night as police launched a murder investigation . Four people have now been arrested on suspicion of murder after Mr Sommerville died from the stab wounds . A man and two women, all in their 20s, were arrested shortly after the brawl in Aldershot Road, Guildford, Surrey, on suspicion of his murder, while another man was arrested in London this morning. Officers probing the murder had earlier cordoned off a large area of the road whilst forensic experts in blue boiler suits and white face masks scoured the scene for clues. A post mortem examination on his body is due to take place in the coming days. Today there was an outpouring of grief from Mr Sommerville's friends and family members. Julie Liddicott said: 'My life or my family’s will never ever be the same again... I love you Dan with all my heart.' Kris Lukic said: 'He was a funny guy and always made me laugh, it was many years ago since I properly spoke to him but have bumped into him on a few occasions. 'My thoughts are with all his family. I know he will be missed by many. RIP Little Dan.' Another friend posted on Facebook: 'Why does it have to be true!? He was so kind, lovely and did so much for my brother. Now he’s just gone, it doesn’t seem real. RIP Dan, you will be missed by absolutely everyone.' He was taken from the scene (pictured) to hospital with stab wounds, but died shortly after arrival . The victim, named locally as Daniel Sommerville, was stabbed during a brawl between the two sets of motorists at the intersection of Aldershot and Worplesdon roads (pictured) He was rushed to Royal Surrey County Hospital (pictured) but died a short while later . Detective Chief Inspector Fiona Macpherson from Surrey Police said: 'This is a tragic incident which has led to the death of a young man and our thoughts and sympathies are with his family and friends at this time. 'We are carrying out a number of inquiries in the local area to establish the full circumstances of what happened. 'I would ask anyone who was in the Aldershot Road area (yesterday) afternoon and may have seen the two vehicles or the altercation taking place to contact police as a matter of urgency.' They said that officers were not treating the suspected murder as a road rage incident at this time.

"She is often referred to as the 'quiet seamstress' whose dignified refusal to move seats on a segregated bus triggered one of the key flashpoints of the civil rights movement. But Rosa Parks was a committed activist who wrote of how she was tired of being 'pushed around' as a black person and was so deeply opposed to segregation she risked her whole future to defy it. This fresh understanding of Parks emerges from a remarkable new archive of her letters, writings, personal notes and photographs which is to be opened to the public for the first time. A 1950s photograph of Rosa Parks and a paper written she wrote about segregation are some of the items in the Rosa Parks archive, soon to be open to the public at the Library of Congress . A personal bible carried by Rosa Parks is one of the amazing exhibits at the library in Washington DC . Mary Mundy, senior archives specialist, left, and Maricia Battle, curator, prints and photographs division, items discuss items in the Rosa Parks archive at the Library of Congress . Beginning on Wednesday at the Library of Congress in Washington DC, visitors will be able to catch a glimpse of the real woman behind the symbol of defiance whose courageous stand on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955, triggered a yearlong boycott that helped dismantle the system of segregation. Parks died in 2005 aged 92 and a protracted legal battle between her heirs and friends had kept the collection from public view for years. However, in 2014 philanthropist Howard Buffett bought the collection and placed it on long-term loan at the national library. Scholars have welcomed the move the make the material more accessible as, until now they had very limited, if any, access to the materials. 'I think it's one of the first times we're actually able to read her voice and it just totally goes against this image of the quiet seamstress,' said Margaret McAleer, an archivist at the library. 'Her writings are phenomenally powerful.' In one extract from the collection. Parks wrote: 'I had been pushed around all my life and felt at this moment that I couldn't take it anymore.' 'When I asked the policeman why we had to be pushed around, he said he didn't know. '""The law is the law. You are under arrest."" I didn't resist.' Parks pictured in 2001 at a ceremony honoring the 46th anniversary of her arrest for civil disobedience . The archive includes thousands of letters, writings and photographs never before displayed in public . A rare photograph of Rosa Parks' husband Raymond Parks is part of the incredible collection . Children's thank you and birthday cards that were sent to Rosa Parks will be available to view . Parks also wrote of feeling lonely and lost as she lived through the struggle with segregation. After her arrest, Parks lost her job as a tailor at Montgomery's largest department store because of her activism. Her husband, Raymond, also lost his job and the couple sank into deep poverty. They moved to Detroit but continued to struggle. She traveled with the NAACP, pressing for civil rights, and eventually landed a job at the Hampton Institute in Virginia earning $3,700 a year — enough to send some money home to her husband and mother. It wasn't until 1965 when Parks was hired for the district office of Michigan Congressman John Conyers that she finally earned a steady, living wage, archivists said. Parks' archive provides scholars and the public with a fuller sense of her life and faith, her personality and her pain, said library historian Adrienne Cannon. 'It's important because we see Rosa Parks in a kind of almost frozen, iconic image — a hero that is not really real flesh and blood,' Cannon said. The archives reveal Parks, pictured left in 1999, was supportive of controversial black leader Malcolm X . Parks riding on a Montgomery Area Transit System bus. She refused to give up her seat to a white man on December 1, 1955, sparking a yearlong boycott of the service which kickstarted the civil rights movement . 'Here we get a sense of a woman that is really full flesh and blood.' The collection may surprise people by revealing Parks had an aggressive edge and supported more radical actions seeking equality over the years, archivists said. She used her symbolic status to support Malcolm X, Black Panther gatherings and the Wilmington 10 in North Carolina. 'She was so deeply opposed to segregation that as the younger generation came along, she didn't hold back from them. She was in the fight,' said Helena Zinkham, the library's collections director. The library now holds about 7,500 manuscript items and 2,500 photographs from Parks, including the Bible she kept in her pocket, letters from admirers and her Presidential Medal of Freedom. A small exhibit is planned for March. All the items will be digitized and posted online. Artifacts such as Parks' clothing, furniture and a pillbox hat she may have worn on the Montgomery bus, will find homes elsewhere. The library plans to place them with other museums or institutions that can conserve and display Parks' belongings. The library is already in talks with the Smithsonian's National Museum of African-American History and Culture, now under construction on the National Mall, to house some items.","Thousands of writings and photographs to go on show in Washington DC .

"They were big, brutish and probably not particularly good-looking. Now it seems that Neanderthals had to contend with an ailment that affected their appearance too - psoriasis. A new genetic study has suggested that these now extinct ancient cousins of modern humans may have suffered from the skin condition that causes red, flaky - and often painful - patches of skin. The research has also revealed that they may have suffered from other modern medical disorders such as Crohn's disease, a condition that affects the digestive system. Neanderthals, like the one above, are thought to have been broad-browed and big nosed but they may also have suffered from the skin condition psoriasis and Crohn's disease according to the latest DNA research . It suggests that the two diseases may have originated in a common ancestor of Neanderthals, Denisovans and modern humans more than a million years ago. Researchers say the genetic changes that link the vulnerability to these diseases may even once have conveyed a benefit to our ancient ancestors. This, they argue, may be why the diseases, which are both caused by inflammation triggered by the immune system, have persisted in the genome. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. A gene that can cause diabetes in Latin Americans is also thought to have come from Neanderthals, long before their ancestors colonised the New World. However, such negative traits can persist through evolution if they do not harm a species survival. Dr Omen Gokcumen, an evolutionary geneticist who led the work at the University at Buffalo, part of the The State University of New York, said: 'Our research shows that some genetic features associated with psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and other aspects of human health are ancient. 'Crohn’s disease and psoriasis are damaging, but our findings suggest that there may be something else — some unknown factor now or in the past — that counteracts the danger when you carry genetic features that may increase susceptibility for these conditions. 'Both diseases are autoimmune disorders, and one can imagine that in a pathogen-rich environment, a highly active immune system may actually be a good thing even if it increases the chances of an auto-immune response.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution, compared modern human genomes to other closely related species including chimpanzees, Neanderthals and Denisovans. Neanderthals are thought to have lived between 280,000 to 40,000 years ago before dying out completely while the Denisovans are thought to have been a sister group to Neanderthals, splitting from a common ancestor around 600,000 years ago. The researchers looked for sections of DNA that had disappeared from the genomes since humans began diverging from chimpanzees - known as deletions. They found 427 deletions in modern humans that were also in the genomes of Neanderthals and Denisovans. Psoriasis is a common skin condition that can cause a rash and flaky or blistery skin (like above) anywhere on the body in modern humans but it may have been a problem for ancient human relatives like Neanderthals . The TV documentary Walking with Neanderthals portrayed the extinct ancient human species (above) as they are commonly seen based on their skeletons but their DNA has also suggested they suffered from psoriasis . By tracing when these deletions may have occurred, by looking at changes in the DNA, the scientists found that about 87 per cent of the deletions occured before modern humans and Neanderthals split from a common ancestor. They found around nine per cent of the deletions found in modern humans probably came from interbreeding between Neanderthals. Indeed, previous research has shown that modern humans in Europe owe around two percent of their DNA to Neanderthals due to interbreeding between the species in the past. Much of what we know about Neanderthals has come from examining their bones, like the skull above, but now DNA extracted from their fossilised remains is helping to shed new light on what their lives were like . Psoriasis is caused by excessive inflammation in the upper layers of the skin by the immune system, causing the skin to thicken, form pustules, bleed and flake off in crusty clumps, as is shown in the diagram above . Neanderthals, like the one depicted above, are thought to have had a common ancestor with modern humans around a million years ago . Some research has suggested that genes we inherited from them could have changed our immune systems while also left us vulnerable to diseases like diabetes and cancer. The new study found 17 gene deletions that code are thought to code for proteins. Most of these are involved in metabolism, growth and sperm development that were probably responsible for some of the changes that occurred as human ancestors evolved from chimpanzees. However, the researchers also found examples of missing DNA that are known to play a role in causing psoriasis and Crohn's disease. This would have meant that both Neanderthals and Denisovans suffered from both of these diseases. Psoriasis can lead to itchy and sometimes painful rashes and blisters on the skin while Crohn's Disease is a chronic inflammation of the digestive system that can cause diarrhoea and stomach pains. Dr Gokcumen said that while these are currently seen as negative diseases in modern humans, they may have provided some benefit to our ancestors. He said the best example of this is sickle cell anemia, a disorder of the red blood cells that can makes it harder for them to carry oxygen around the body, but also prevents infection by the malaria parasite. Yen-Lung Lin, who is the lead author of the study, added: 'We’re thinking forces that maintain variation might be more relevant to human health and biology than previously believed.'","Geneticists from the University at Buffalo studied ancient human DNA .

"An eight-year-old boy who fell from a second floor window as he tried to escape being tickled by his little sister survived after a plastic porch broke his fall. Rhys Sykes plunged two storeys when he recoiled from being tickled by his little sister Megan and accidentally tumbled out of the window of his Cheltenham home. The youngster survived and escaped any serious injury after a plastic porch broke his fall. Paramedics said the porch  saved the youngster's life, because without it he would have fallen 10 feet to the concrete below. Rhys Sykes escaped a fall from a second storey bedroom at his family home without serious injury because a plastic porch broke his fall, after he tumbled out of the window as his little sister tried to tickle him . The youngster, eight, survived because he landed on the the plastic porch (pictured above) Tricia Sykes found her son lying outside. She said: 'I got there as he was trying to get up,' said Mrs Sykes. 'He was just screaming constantly. My neighbour actually thought someone was dying.' Rhys suffered an eight millimetre-long bleed on his brain and a fractured skull from the fall but after spending five days at Bristol Children's Hospital was well enough to be released. Mrs Sykes added: 'I didn't see any of it but from what we can gather from Rhys, and the holes left in the porch. He fell out the window and landed squarely on the porch. 'Then he fell on to the concrete next to the back door. 'He is so lucky as on either side of the walkway is a wall, if he had fallen on that he could have broken his back or something, but incredibly he fell on the floor.' Megan, six, had tried to tickle her older brother Rhys as the two played a game and he recoiled, falling out . She said she had never expected her naturally cautious son, who took six months worth of encouragement to play basketball would hurt himself. The eight-year-old had been watching a film with his sister Megan in his parents' bedroom and had climbed up on to the ledge under the window - which doubles as an emergency exit. He then recoiled as his little sister tried to tickle him and tumbled down. Mrs Sykes and husband Adrian, 29, who were downstairs, heard a bump and assumed Rhys has fallen asleep watching the film and tumbled out of bed. But as Mrs Sykes went upstairs she saw a stricken Megan, who told her: 'He's outside mummy. Rhys is outside.' Rhys was taken to hospital by his mother and had to spend five days there after fracturing his skull . A CT scan after the accident revealed that Rhys had a small bleed on the left hand side of his brain . Tricia said: 'My nurse cadet training from school just kicked in and I rang for an ambulance. 'I went into autopilot really. I left the back gate open for the paramedics. I went around packing Rhys' possessions for hospital. If I hadn't have had the training, I would probably have been flapping. 'Rhys was very erratic. He was screaming in and out of the ambulance. The left side of his brain was swelling. Rhys was rushed to the Gloucester Royal Hospital, where after a CT scan revealed a skull fracture, he was transferred to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. Rhys Sykes was released from hospital after five days and has made a recovery after the ordeal . The fall has left Rhys more sensitive to noise although doctors believe he will adjust as he grows older. Mrs Sykes added: 'It is a complete miracle, still to this day I have no idea how we were only in the hospital for so few days. 'I've always said the first person to break a bone or end up in hospital would be Megan as she is a daredevil.'","Rhys Sykes, 8, was playing with his younger sister Megan in parents' room .

"It is the perfect video for the armchair traveller - a snapshot of South East Asia in just four minutes. American Josh Rapperport mounted a hands-fee camera on his motorbike as he raced around some of the beautiful and most perilous tracks in the world and turned the footage into a beautiful travel video. The adventurer visited countries including Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar, capturing amazing scenery and friendly locals. The Harvard University student used the camera when dismounted from his motorbike to record some incredible and fascinating scenes . From dirt tracks, to mountain roads to bridges, it was certainly some adventure for Rapperport . The tourist had to wait at this 'elephant crossing' as the giant animal made its way past with a couple of tourists on board . Taking in crystal blue waters, mountain-winding dirt tracks and numerous stop-offs taking in the local cultures, his adventure can now be shared by us all. Locals are filmed moving to the side as Rapperport speeds on by, with many of the routes perched perilously on the sides of mountains. A stop off in Thailand is filmed; tourists are shown leaping through a burning ring of fire and onto the sand at one of the world famous Full Moon parties. Rapperport then takes some time out to relax from his motorcycle trek. The camera is taken to the beach, into rock-pools and then on the back of a kayak at one serene location on his adventure. Cruising down the Mekong Delta, riding on elephants, and then an unfortunate collision with a moped are documented beautifully. Hopefully not drink driving?! Rapperport takes a break from his epic trek to have a cold beverage . Rapperport was on hand to catch the antics of Thai locals as well as fellow tourists as they dived through the ring of fire . The student was on hand to join in New Year's celebrations during his time travelling in Asia . Rapperport takes us through a whole host of customs and traditions throughout his journey, from visiting Buddhist temples, a stop off at Angkor Wat, to cattle-herding and New Year's celebrations. The Harvard University student said: 'I took a year away from school to do some adventuring, ending up with a journey of a lifetime, riding 3,000 miles across Southeast Asia, mostly alone, via motorbike. 'The journey took almost three months, and the experiences are something I will never forget. 'This journey took place across 3,000 miles in Southeast Asia. The views as the American traversed on the dirt roads are something he will remember forever . Rapperport's friend Logan joined him for three weeks on the trip where the pair chilled out on the beaches . There was time for Rapperport to dismount the camera and film himself enjoying the crystal blue waters . 'I rode over every variety of road and environment - through villages that rarely, if ever, had a traveler come through. '(It) was a wild and enlightening experience of adventure, culture and solitude. I rode alone for almost the entire three months. My good friend Logan joined me for three weeks.'","Josh Rapperport captured perilous dirt-tracks and beautiful beaches on three-month trip around Asia .

"It may be hard to imagine choosing a mealworm burger over a juicy steak in a restaurant. But a team of scientists insist a Quorn-like product made from mealworm protein, tastes good and is a rich source of protein. The food, named C-fu, has primarily been designed to help feed the world’s growing population, which is set to top nine billion by 2050, but its makers believe it could also catch on as a health food. A team of scientists have created a Quorn-like product made from mealworm protein (pictured in its raw form), which they say tastes good and is a rich source of protein, so it could be a hit with shoppers . Students from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York and the Schulich School of Business, York University, Canada, created the 'bug meat,' composed of mealworms. They developed a technique to isolate the protein from worms and restructure it, to make more appetising C-fu cubes, which resemble blocks of tofu. It takes 10,000 mealworms to make one pound of C-fu, but the students say that the end product has more protein than tofu and is pound-for-pound more protein-rich than an egg. The food also contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are associated with lowering the risk of heart disease, making it a healthier alternative to meat. The food, named C-fu, shown here as a substitute for minced beef, has been designed to help feed the world’s growing population, which is set to top nine billion by 2050 . It takes 10,000 mealworms (stock image) to make one pound of C-fu, but the students say that the end product has more protein than tofu and is pound-for-pound more protein rich than an egg . Scientists predict that the world’s agricultural output needs to increase by 70 per cent to feed everyone in 2050. Farming insects is more environmentally friendly and less demanding than rearing cows, for example. One third of the global population, or two billion people, already eat insects as a regular part of their diet. Thailand, for example already has 20,000 small scale insect farms rearing over 7,500 tonnes of grasshoppers, crickets and other edible insects a year. Insects are nutritious because they are high in essential fatty acids, calcium, zinc, iron and B12. Gram for gram crickets, for example, have comparable levels of protein compared to beef half the calories and about 60 per cent less fat and fans of the food, describe the insects as ‘nutty’. The creators of C-fu claim it product has more protein than tofu and is pound-for-pound more protein rich than an egg. The food also contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are associated with lowering the risk of heart disease, making it a healthier alternative to meat. ‘C-fu is dense nutrition that will help alleviate global hunger and nutrient deficiencies while providing livelihoods for microfarmers and processors,’ the students wrote as part of their entry to the Thought For Food Challenge. Ten finalists were announced, which will compete for $10,000 (£6,625) of seed funding to bring their hunger-beating products to market at a conference next month. Since September 2014, student teams from over 300 universities in 51 countries have been competing to develop concepts to alleviate hunger across the world. It’s hoped that insect-based foods will play a key role, because they are easier and less energy-intensive to farm than livestock such as cows. Traditional meat production causes multiple sustainability issues, including large greenhouse gas emissions, while insects on the other hand, are very efficient consumers of resources. The team says that C-fu has less impact on the environment than meat, because insects use less land, consume less food and emit less greenhouse gases. It estimates that an area the size of Rhode Island – 1,122 square miles (3,140 square km) used to farm mealworms, – would feed two billion people. The team hopes that its insect-sourced food will be acceptable to consumers because of its bland appearance and have shared recipes such as C-fu empanadas in blog posts. ‘C-fu products will enter markets, groceries, and restaurants, increasing demand for insect foods and encouraging microfarmers worldwide,’ they predict. ‘Demand for insects as raw materials in new products will enable insect commodity markets to thrive and create a whole new food sector and jobs.’ Scientists predict that the world’s agricultural output needs to increase by 70 per cent to feed everyone in 2050.

Mexican restaurant chain, Wahaca, has served insects as an alternative source of protein since  2013 and its grasshopper dish (shown) is popular . More British restaurants and supermarkets are choosing to supply insects like crickets, grasshoppers and mealworms. They have been a traditional Mexican food since the time of the Aztecs and are consumed in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca, which was co-founded in 2007 by Masterchef winner Thomasina Miers, started to introduce the alternate protein source to diners in 2013. In January, it brought back chapulines fundido to the menu, made with one of Mexico's most sustainably farmed, yet unusual ingredients - grasshoppers. Chefs cook the fried chapulines (grashoppers) with softened shallots, garlic and smoky chipotle chillies to create a salsa, which is served with queso fundido, a mixture of grated mozzarella and cheddar cheese and a side of corn tortillas - and stocks are running low. Archipelago restaurant in Cleveland Street has love bug salads, bushmans's caviar (caramel mealworms, blinis, coconut cream and vodka jelly) and a dessert called Medieval Hive (brown butter ice-cream, honey and butter caramel sauce and a baby bee) on the menu. Grub, an insect emporium in London, sells insect starter packs of mealworms, crickets, buffalo worms and grasshoppers on sale alongside their cricket nut fudge. The company is now supplying insects to Planet Organic, the UK's largest fully-certified organic supermarket. British wine merchants Laithwaite's last year created the world's first insect and wine matching guide, to match Chardonnay to tarantulas, sparkling rose to barbecued locusts, sherry to giant waterbugs and Shiraz to sago worms.","Students  from Cornell University, New York and the Schulich School of Business, York University, Canada, created C-fu from mealworms .

"Julie Bishop may be behind her leader but one of Tony Abbott's team has become the first to openly call for the Prime Minister to resign. West Australian backbencher Dennis Jensen has called for the Liberal Party to move to oust Mr Abbott, adding 'the more quickly you do this, the better'. 'I believe that it is necessary that this is brought to a head and lanced,' Dr Jensen told the ABC on Tuesday. West Australian backbencher Dennis Jensen has called for the Liberal Party to  oust the Prime Minister, saying: 'He is not focused on policy. He is not focused on strategic direction. He is focused more on tactics and tactical policy' He said he had informed Mr Abbott of his lack of support on January 23 via text message after deciding the party was 'not governing as we should be…there is no strategic direction, the policy is not consistent and coherent'. 'He is not focused on policy. He is not focused on strategic direction. He is focused more on tactics and tactical policy,' Dr Jensen said of the Prime Minister, according to the ABC. The backbencher said that while he did not want to be seen as the person 'pulling the trigger', he knew of a number of MP's who 'feel similarly', adding: 'I thought it was time to strike to start things moving,' Fairfax reports. Dr Jensen was involved in calling the first of the Liberal spills in 2009 that ultimately saw Mr Abbott installed as the party's leader. Now, Mr Abbott is under pressure to improve his performance. Dr Jensen's (left) comments come just hours after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop made a definitive statement to Cabinet  saying she will not mount a leadership challenge against Tony Abbott (right) Two Queensland MP's, including Warren Entsch and Mal Brough, plan to resolve the leadership problem when the party room meets in Canberra next Tuesday . 'I have issues and I'm hoping to work through with the prime minister,' Mr Brough said. 'The matter needs to be resolved and if Tuesday is the appropriate time for people to talk about it ... then it's for them to say so.' It comes just hours after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop made a definitive statement to Cabinet on Tuesday afternoon saying she will not mount a leadership challenge against Mr Abbott. Her announcement was made in order to quiet speculation she was counting numbers to unseat the Prime Minister after reports surfaced that she had refused to give an assurance to Mr Abbott that she would not run against him in a spill for the Coalition leadership. 'I am not campaigning for the job of Prime Minister, I will not challenge the leader,' she told Cabinet, Sky News reports. 'I am not ringing the backbench asking for support, I'm not counting numbers.' No challenge: Tony Abbott met with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Sunday afternoon and asked her not to run against him for leadership of the Liberal party . Mr Abbott has been under heavy fire since announcing his decision on Australia Day to knight Prince Philip and reports that he met with Ms Bishop on Sunday seek a guarantee that he enjoyed her full support. Treasurer Joe Hockey told reporters after leaving the meeting to address the RBA interest rate cut: 'I have no doubt at all that Julie Bishop is absolutely 100 per cent supportive of the Prime Minister.' It comes after Mr Abbott was ambushed by TV host Leigh Sales after she stepped out of the studio to question him at a childcare centre. Tony Abbott was visiting the Little Pines Centre in Sydney with his wife Margie on Tuesday when he was ambushed by ABC 7.30 host Leigh Sales over leadership speculation . In the fiery exchange, veteran journalist Sales asked Mr Abbott if he would 'bring on a spill' to put an end to speculation about the Liberal leadership . The Prime Minister refused to answer when Sales asked him if he had sought assurance from Ms Bishop that she wouldn't challenge him. 'Look, Julie and I have lots of talks, as you'd expect. We're friends, we're colleagues, we're part of the leadership team and we support each other,' he said. In the fiery exchange, Sales asked Mr Abbott if he would 'bring on a spill' to put an end to speculation about the Liberal leadership. 'You're the speculator, Leigh, not me,' Mr Abbott hit back. Sales pushed Mr Abbott saying 'I assure you that a lot of people on the backbench are speculating as well, Prime Minister.' 'Leigh, the thing is that we were elected because people were sick of chaos. That's why we were elected – people were sick of chaos,' Mr Abbott said. 'And what I am determined to do is give Australia back the certainty and stability that people crave. People want a government which is focused on doing the right thing by them, not focused on itself.' Sales poked fun at his repeated attempts to dodge the tough questions when she tweeted a photo of Mr Abbott playing with children at the Little Pines Centre with his wife Margie. 'The PM @tonyabbottmhr taking a few tricky questions from the punters,' the caption read. The ABC told Daily Mail Australia that Sales liked to get out of the studio as much as possible and went to press conferences from time to time. Mr Abbott and his wife Margie visited the childcare with local member Craig Laundy to talk about the government's jobs and families package . Ms Bishop says she is not counting numbers and his not calling backbenchers . The press conference was streamed live on the ABC and some took to social media to comment on Leigh Sales' showing up to question Mr Abbott . The ABC said Sales liked to get out of the studio as much as possible and went to press conferences from time to time . Mr Abbott also refused to deny reports he met with Ms Bishop and asked her not to mount a challenge when he appeared on Channel Seven's Sunrise on Tuesday morning. 'I think people find all that insider Canberra stuff boring,' he told Channel Seven's Sunrise. 'I have meetings with Julie Bishop all the time.' When asked repeatedly if he asked Ms Bishop not to challenge, Mr Abbott said: 'I'm not going to play these Canberra insider games'. 'What (people) are looking for is politicians who are not endlessly navel gazing, not fighting amongst themselves, but are getting on with the government of this country,' he said. Ms Bishop reportedly refused  the commitment because she was angered by news reports at the weekend that she had told Mr Abbott she wouldn't challenge. Julie Bishop, NSW Premier Mike Baird (left) and the United Kingdom's Secretary of State Philip Hammond (right) signed the Lindt cafe condolence book on Monday following the Sydney siege . Ms Bishop and United Kingdom's Secretary of State Philip Hammond signed the siege condolence book at Martin Place for the victim's of the Sydney siege . Treasurer Joe Hockey dismissed reports Ms Bishop declined to give  a commitment. 'Unsourced gossip,' he said when asked about the Sky News report on Channel Nine's Today show. It comes as Mr Abbott made it clear during a major speech in Canberra on Monday that he would not give up the top job amid speculation of a leadership challenge. 'We were elected in 2013 because the Australian people rejected chaos,' he said. 'It's the people that hire and frankly it's the people that should fire.' The Prime Minister has been shaken by various blows in recent weeks, including the Liberal National Party loss at the Queensland state election at the weekend. Mr Abbott said of Ms Bishop: 'She's a friend of mine, Julie's my deputy, she's been a terrific deputy, been a terrific minister, I believe I have her full support.' Treasurer Joe Hockey dismissed reports Ms Bishop declined to give a commitment . Mr Abbott was also widely criticised for knighting Prince Philip on Australia Day. With leadership speculation rife in recent days, Mr Abbott warned on Monday that his government must not repeat the mistakes of the past as he dumped his Paid Parental Leave scheme. 'The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years cannot become the new normal lest Australia join the weak government club and become a second rate country living off its luck,' he said. 'I never came into politics to be popular.' He also made mention of Ms Bishop saying: 'She's a friend of mine, Julie's my deputy, she's been a terrific deputy, been a terrific minister, I believe I have her full support.'","West Australian backbencher Dennis Jensen called for the Liberal Party to  oust Tony Abbott .

"Etan Patz's best friend has recalled in court how she saved the six-year-old boy a seat on the bus on the morning he vanished but he never turned up. Chelsea Altman, now an actress and Brooklyn restaurant owner, wept as she testified in the murder trial for Pedro Hernandez, who is on trial for killing the missing child more than 30 years ago. Altman, whose family lived opposite the Patz family on Prince Street in SoHo, took the stand on Monday and recalled the morning of May 25, 1979, when Patz failed to get on the bus. When she returned home from school that day, she picked up a call from Etan's worried mother, Julie Patz, and told her that she didn't know where the boy was. 'She was shocked,' she told Manhattan Supreme Court, DNAinfo reported. 'She was very upset.' Emotional: Chelsea Altman, who was best friends with Etan Patz at the time he vanished in 1979, wept as she recounted how he failed to get on the bus for school the day that he vanished . Justice for Etan: Pedro Hernandez (left), pictured in 2012, is standing trial for the 1979 kidnapping and murder of the six-year-old who disappeared on his way to school in 1979 . Altman, who is now a mother herself, recalled how Etan was 'very curious and sweet, a little mischievous but not rebellious' and how excited they both were that their families were planning on taking a vacation together. She added how Etan had spoken about taking a trip with a friend called Johnny, who he said had a van and candy, but she said she believed this was just an imaginary friend. She also testified how Susan Harrington, who was paid to walk her and Etan home on occasion, would sometimes meet them with a man - but she denied he looked like Jose Ramos, a long-time suspect in the case and a convicted pedophile. Altman, who owns restaurants Olea and Allswell in Brooklyn, took the stand on the second day of testimony in the murder trial for Hernandez, who had worked in a shop in the area at the time. Earlier that day, Etan's mother, 72-year-old Julie Patz, described the moment she saw her son for the last time 35 years ago. She told the jury the youngster was trusting but also scared of being lost or alone and broke into tears when describing her feelings when she realized her son was missing. Her testimony was the only time she will appear in court because she cannot bear to go through the trial and be reminded of what happened. Memories: Altman, who is now a mother herself, said that Etan had spoken about taking a trip with a man who had a van and candy - but that she always thought he was talking about an imaginary friend . She arrived at the court separately for her husband Stan, who turned up with his daughter Shira, and was not wearing a wedding ring. Mrs Patz recounted her time living in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood when her son, Etan, was little and how he vanished after she allowed him to walk to school alone for the first time. 'That was the last time I saw him. I watched him walk one block away. I turned around and went back upstairs and that was the last time.' Etan had asked his mother if he could walk to catch the school bus on his own. She initially said no but capitulated. On the day he went missing she told him to go straight to the bodega and get a drink with money he had been saving up. 'I reminded him to come directly home from school, no side trips anywhere,' she said. She told the court how the store, where Hernandez worked as a youngster, was dark, dirty and poorly stocked. However because of the location other parents in the neighborhood would often tell the children to meet there in an emergency. The boy was 'totally outgoing and trusting of everyone — totally nonjudgmental about people,' his mother said. 'Everyone that he met once was his friend and was a nice person.' But while Etan craved independence and was eager to become a grown-up, Patz said, 'at the same time he was very fearful of being lost or left alone by himself.' Testimony: Julie Patz, mother of Etan Patz, (pictured arriving at court) told said her son was 'trusting' and terrified of being alone as she took to the stand at his alleged killer's murder trial in Manhattan . Painful memories: Etan Patz's mother Julie, center, described the moment she saw her son for the last time 35 years ago at the murder trial of his alleged killer Pedro Hernandez, right . Family support: Shira Patz, Etan's sister (center) and Stan Patz, his father, arrive at court on Monday . Mrs Patz cried when talking about how she felt in the hours after she learned Etan was missing. 'I don't remember a thing about that night and the next day, quite honestly,' she said. She recalls only having 'very rubbery legs,' an upset stomach and difficulty walking, thinking and talking. 'Our home became police headquarters. Global command. It was very strange.' 'It was not fun,' she added. 'Our children were handed off to neighbors and friends because our house was a madhouse. It's been more like a circus than anything else.' Asking questions from prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, she said women in her neighborhood criticized her for playing and laughing with her children just months after Etan vanished. She also became emotional when she started describing the impact the case which has spanned three decades has had on her children. 'My daughter and my son, this has been almost their entire lives,' she said. 'It's very difficult to continuously try to regain a sense of normalcy in your daily life (while having it) constantly being pulled out from under you with new developments in the case, new leads or whatever,' she said. After the coverage surrounding her son's disappearance died down in the 1980's she shied away from the spotlight. Her husband Stan started making most of the appearances in public. A look back: In this March 1980 photo, Stan and Julie Patz stand on the  fire escape of their loft in SoHo. Below them runs Prince Street, along which Etan, their six-year-old son, set off to school on May 25, 1979 . Harrowing: Mrs Patz recounted how she watched Etan walk to school on his own for the first time from their Soho apartment (pictured). It was the last time she saw him . She has only been seen at a handful of court dates. Hernandez said in his videotaped confession that he had lured the youngster into the basement of the store and strangled him. During the investigation in 1979, New York police jotted down his name among those of many people they met during their feverish search. But it wasn't until 2012 that Hernandez emerged as a suspect. The apparent breakthrough in the case was based on a tip and a videotaped confession that prosecutors say was foreshadowed by remarks he made to friends and relatives in the 1980s. His defense hinges on convincing jurors that the confession is false, along with suggesting that the real killer may be a convicted Pennsylvania child molester who was a prime suspect for years. Etan became one of the first missing children featured on milk cartons. His parents helped advocate for legislation that created a nationwide law enforcement framework to address such cases, and the anniversary of his disappearance became National Missing Children's Day. The trial is expected to last up to three months. Witnesses are expected to include psychologists, an inmate informant who knows Hernandez, and possibly other informants testifying against the earlier suspect.","Chelsea Altman, who was six-year-old Etan's best friend when he vanished on May 25, 1979, testified in Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday .

As a follower of our band Napalm Death, you would appreciate that our lyrics and ethos challenge the unbroken cycle of violence in the world, whether it comes from a state or as an individual. If these things are not challenged and ultimately changed, I believe we will never truly move forward as humankind. I understand that you are standing as a leader determined to change things for the better, and so I believe granting clemency would be a major step forward in this pursuit of betterment. I appreciate that heroin can be damaging on many levels, but I believe that this is a much deeper issue that cannot be changed or altered by simply taking away the lives of people. Again, I respectfully ask that you make a real difference and overturn these sentences. In hope and peace, .

"Ross Katsambanis, a commerce student and AFL fan, was outraged when he was required to sign a legal waiver at the Hellenic Republic restaurant in Brunswick . A Melbourne man said he 'nearly choked on his succulent, slow-cooked lamb' after he had to sign a legal waiver to take his food home from an exclusive restaurant in a doggy bag. Monash University student Ross Katsambanis, 20, visited the Hellenic Republic restaurant on Lygon St, Brunswick East, Victoria, on the night of December 27 to celebrate his grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary. There were plenty of leftovers but he was stunned when a waitress at the restaurant - co-owned by George Calombaris - told him he would have to sign a legal document to take home his meat and dips. 'I nearly choked on my succulent slow-cooked lamb after hearing this news,' he wrote in a blog post afterwards. Mr Katsambanis said he was told the waiver was introduced to comply with local council regulations. ''I thought that's just bizarre,' he told Daily Mail Australia in an  interview. 'All I wanted to do was take it home and eat it.' A Moreland City Council spokesman denied their health regulations were responsible, saying they only applied to food consumed on restaurant premises. However, restaurant industry sources said they were increasingly being targeted by litigious customers who were taking their food home and getting sick. Katsambanis, 20, left, thought it was bizarre when the Hellenic Republic restaurant co-owned by George Calombaris (right) asked him to sign the legal waiver .

'I hereby take full responsibility for the removal of food from Hellenic Republic Brunswick': The waiver customers who request doggy bags are asked to sign . Mr Katsambanis told Daily Mail Australia he never had any intentions to sue the restaurant. 'It was going to be my responsibility. If I did get food poisoning, it would have been my fault.' 'There's no chance I was going to sue them.... I was just surprised to have to sign a waiver to take home some food. Lauren Calleja, spokeswoman for MAdE Establishments - which operates prestigious restaurants the Hellenic Republic, Press Club and Maha - said the warnings were in the customer's best interest . 'We don't really know how they're going to store the food,' said Ms Calleja. 'It's kind of out of our hands what the customer does for it after they leave the venue.' 'It's more to make sure they are going to eat it they do it in a healthy time and they refrigerate it. it's in their best interests. She said food customers wanted to doggy bag had often been left on the plate for a 'couple of hours' after they ordered it. 'We don't get a lot of (doggy bag requests)', she added. John Hart, the CEO of the Restaurant and Caterers Association of Australia, said restaurants were increasingly being targeted by strict liability suits after food had been consumed.

Mr Hart said he was 'not surprised' restaurants were issuing legal waivers. 'As we all know we're becoming more of a litigious society and we end up with people hoiding us responsible for incidents that happen away from our businesses,' Mr Hart said. The Association has produced stickers for restaurants to use on doggy bags which warn customers not to hold onto takeaway food for more than 24 hours. Ms Calleja said Hellenic Republic's waivers had nothing to do with an incident at Hellenic Republic restaurant in Kew in May 2014 where two groups of diners were struck down by the norovirus. The waivers were introduced 'three or four years ago', she said.","Melbourne man outraged after being asked to sign a legal waiver to doggy bag food .

"Harper Collins announced on Tuesday that Harper Lee, pictured here in 2007 at the White House, is publishing a book she set aside almost 50 years ago . 'To Kill a Mockingbird' will not be the reclusive author Harper Lee's only published book after all. In an announcement that left millions both shocked and thrilled, publisher Harper announced Tuesday that 'Go Set a Watchman,' a completed novel the Pulitzer Prize-winning author wrote in the 1950s then put aside unpublished, will hit store shelves in July. The news instantly turned 88-year-old Lee's lost tome into one of the most eagerly anticipated novels in years. It also leaves open for speculation what sort of massive book deal a living legend author who spent most of her life avoiding ever releasing more than a single, beloved novel might receive. Rediscovered last fall, 'Go Set a Watchman' is essentially a sequel to 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' although it was finished earlier. The 304-page book will be Lee's second, and the first new work in more than 50 years. The publisher plans a first printing of 2 million copies. 'In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called 'Go Set a Watchman,'' Lee said in a statement issued by Harper. 'It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort. My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel (what became 'To Kill a Mockingbird') from the point of view of the young Scout. 'I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realized it (the original book) had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it. 'After much thought and hesitation, I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years.' According to publisher Harper, Carter came upon the manuscript at a 'secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill a Mockingbird.' The new book is set in Lee's famed Maycomb, Alabama, during the mid-1950s, 20 years after 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and roughly contemporaneous with the time that Lee was writing the story. Harper Lee spent most of her life avoiding the spotlight following the massive success of he first and only novel To Kill a Mockingbird. So, less than three months since the death of her sharp-as-a-tack lifelong confidante sister Alice, should the public be suspicious of news the recluse is suddenly releasing a novel she penned in the 1950s? According to Jezebel, such suspicion is warranted. Protector: Harper Lee's older sister Alice ran the family law firm for some 40 years before finally retiring at 100, having remained all that time her sister's staunch defender and protector . The 88-year-old author has reportedly been in ill health since 2007, when she suffered a stroke that left her wheelchair-bound, nearly deaf and blind and unable to live on her own. Lee is now represented by Tonja Carter, who succeeded Alice in the family firm. According to Gawker, 'Lee has a history of signing whatever's put in front of her, apparently sometimes with Carter's advice.' Carter has a history of going after apparent infringements of copyrights held by Lee, even once going after a business owner in Lee's beloved hometown of Monroeville, Alabama who was selling merchandise that capitalized on her name and that of her novel. Alice Lee, who spent decades protecting her little sister from the spotlight, died last year at the age of 103. With a new Harper Lee book being released just months after her attorney sister  (pictured) Alice's death, some are questioning whether the publication is the wish of Harper Lee--who's been nearly deaf and blind since a stroke left her wheelchair-bound in 2007--or of someone else . The civil rights movement was taking hold by the time she was working on 'Watchman.' The Supreme Court had ruled unanimously in 1953 that segregated schools were unconstitutional, and the arrest of Rosa Parks in 1955 led to the yearlong Montgomery bus boycott. 'Scout (Jean Louise Finch) has returned to Maycomb from New York to visit her father, Atticus,' the publisher's announcement reads. 'She is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her father's attitude toward society, and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood.' Lee herself is a Monroeville, Alabama native who lived in New York in the 1950s. She now lives in her hometown. According to the publisher, the book will be released as she first wrote it, with no revisions. Lee, pictured here with Gergory Peck filming the movie version of To Kill a Mockingbird, said in a statement:  After much thought and hesitation, I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication . 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is among the most beloved novels in history, with worldwide sales topping 40 million copies. It was released on July 11, 1960, won the Pulitzer Prize and was adapted into a 1962 movie of the same name, starring Gregory Peck in an Oscar-winning performance as the courageous attorney Atticus Finch. One of the most beloved novels in history, Lee's original novel has sold over 40 million copies. But it was written second . Although occasionally banned over the years because of its language and racial themes, the novel has become a standard for reading clubs and middle schools and high schools. The absence of a second book from Lee only seemed to enhance the appeal of 'Mockingbird.' Lee's publisher said the author is unlike to do any publicity for the book. She has rarely spoken to the media since the 1960s, when she told one reporter that she wanted to 'to leave some record of small-town, middle-class Southern life.' Until now, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' had been the sole fulfillment of that goal. 'This is a remarkable literary event,' Harper publisher Jonathan Burnham said in a statement. 'The existence of 'Go Set a Watchman' was unknown until recently, and its discovery is an extraordinary gift to the many readers and fans of 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' Reading in many ways like a sequel to Harper Lee's classic novel, it is a compelling and ultimately moving narrative about a father and a daughter's relationship, and the life of a small Alabama town living through the racial tensions of the 1950s.' The new book also will be available in an electronic edition. Lee has openly started her preference for paper, but surprised fans last year by agreeing to allow 'Mockingbird' to be released as an e-book. The reclusive writer of To Kill A Mockingbird has shunned the spotlight following the success of her Pulitzer prize-winning first novel in 1960, refusing to do interviews or make public appearances. To Kill A Mockingbird, won the Pulitzer Prize, is translated into nearly 50 languages and was turned into the Oscar-winning 1962 film starring Gregory Peck. It has sold some 30 million copies and made Harper into a multi-millionairess. It is the story of race and growing up in Depression-era Alabama, based loosely on Lee's own experiences. It was published in 1960 shortly after the dawn of the U.S. civil rights movement and became required reading in many American schools. In the tome, a principled lawyer named Atticus Finch defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman and wins his family the scorn of many racist white residents of the fictional town of Maycomb. Finch loses the case despite what would appear in today’s terms to have been an airtight case of his client Tom’s innocence. Tom is jailed then shot dead after escaping custody—a ‘mockingbird’ whose innocence and then life are taken away by the malevolence of a violently racist society. To Kill A Mockingbird was made into a movie starring Gregory Peck and featuring Brock Peter as Tom Robinson, the black farmhand accused of raping a white woman in Depression-era Alabama . When Marja Mills, a former Chicago Tribune, last year wrote about being Lee's neighbor for year in, The Mockingbird Next Door: Life With Harper Lee, Lee disowned it. 'Miss Mills befriended my elderly sister, Alice. It did not take long to discover Marja's true mission: another book about Harper Lee,' the statement said. 'I was hurt, angry, saddened, but not surprised.I immediately cut off all contact with Miss Mills, leaving town whenever she headed this way. 'Rest assured, as long as I am alive, any book purporting to be with my cooperation is a falsehood.' Older sister and lawyer Alice Lee died last November after fifty years helping to guard her sibling's privacy. Harper Lee has not given an official interview since Mockingbird came out, but has intermittently released statements to media. She even sued a museum in her south Alabama hometown over its sale of souvenirs featuring her name and the title of her book, and accepted a settlement. She has been described as a 'delicious mystery', and while having started other books, one a non-fiction about an Alabama serial killer, she filed them away as unfinished.","Go Set a Watchman, a 304-page book, will be Lee's second .

"A fundraising page started to support the grieving family of a Gold Coast man who died protecting his wife and children during a lightning storm has raised $26,000 overnight, as strangers and friends alike pay tribute to the 'devoted' father of two. Kane Bennett, 39, was killed on Saturday after he, along with his wife Mary Mourgelas, their 22-month-old son Max and 12-week-old daughter Bella, were all hit by lightning during an electrical storm in Worongary. The family had taken shelter in a gazebo after voting in the Queensland election when the lightning struck, killing Mr Bennett, who took the impact of the blow to protect his two young children and partner of 19 years. Kane Bennett died on Saturday after being struck by a bolt of lightning during an electrical storm . He was pronounced dead several hours later after being rushed to Gold Coast University Hospital, while Ms Mourgelas and her two children were released with minor injuries. Friends and family of the Bennett's reflected on the loss of Mr Bennett, labelling him a loving father and devoted husband who thrived when he was with his loved ones. 'Kane was truly devoted to Mary. They had been together for 19 years after meeting in 1996 and had just celebrated their nine-year wedding anniversary,' said a family spokesperson. 'The couple travelled extensively before settling down to have their family. When Kane was with Mary and his kids he was at his happiest. His pride and love for his family was clear for all to see.' A crowdfunding page, set up on Monday, to support Ms Mourgelas, Max, and Bella, said that 'Kane's final act was to ensure that he took the full force of the lightning storm so that his family was safe.' 'This page is to raise funds to support Mary, Max and Bella as they grieve the loss of a wonderful husband and Dad.' The page was initially set up with the goal of raising $10,000, but has surpassed expectations, raising over $26,000 in less than 24 hours. Family friend Steph Julian set up the crowdfunding page to help ease the financial burden of Mr Bennett's death. Mary Mourgelas and Kane Bennett had been together for 19 years and had two children together . 'Kane was in the middle of renovating their house when he passed away,' Ms Julian told AAP. 'So Mary's brought babies home to no kitchen cupboards and a half-finished cubby house.' The donations, along with messages of sympathy, have flooded in to the page, ranging from pledges of $10 to $3000. 'I don't know you Mary, but your family has been in my thoughts since I heard of this terrible tragedy. I am so sorry for your loss - my heart goes out to you and your beautiful children,' said one donor. 'I am sure you are so proud of your husband and I know he will be looking out for you from above,' said another. A statement from the family released through Queensland Police detailed Mr Bennett's active service in East Timor with the Australian Defense Force between 1994 and 2004, including peace-keeping missions, reported The Brisbane Times. The statement also revealed Mr Bennett's generous heart and passion for helping youth during his career as a social worker and educator. 'Kane thoroughly enjoyed motivating young people and helping to build confidence in those who lacked it'. Mr Bennett was involved with the Get Set For Work Programme on the Gold Coast for at-risk youth, and also worked with the  Cerebal Palsy League, before working with Charlton Brown in Brisbane. Mr Bennett served in the Australian Defense Force for ten years and was involving in peace-keeping missions .

"A man has built a Del Boy version of the famous flying car Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. John Rothwell spent three years constructing the world's first three-wheeled replica using the frame of a Reliant Rialto - similar to the car used in Only Fools and Horses. The 51-year-old, who is a big fan of the film, which is based on the children's book by Bond creator Ian Fleming, spent about £4,000 converting the car, which comes complete with wings. Scroll down for video . Flying car: John Rothwell in his three-wheeled version of the famous car Chitty Chitty Bang Bang which took him three years to make . Movie magic: Dick Van Dyke in the original Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car from the movie of the same name which came out in 1968 and was based on Ian Fleming's book Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The magical Car . After buying the Reliant Rialto for about £800, Mr Rothwell spent days days stripping the vehicle back to its chassis in May 2011. He then bought pine to build the frame of the car and 30 strips of red cedar from a fencing company for £300 to make the new body. The boat was made using plywood, using 27, 8ft lengths he cut by hand. The vehicles engine was stripped and re-built and new brakes were fitted and it was converted to an electronic ignition. Mr Rothwell made the wings using fabric usually used to make bouncy castles and used electric window motors to motorise them, at a cost of around £190. Carpet was added, for £80, and several hundred more was spent on brass and aluminium to give the vehicle a shiny finish. Humble beginnings: He built the car using the frame of a Reliant Rialto - like the car used in Only Fools and Horses - which is seen above . Used for parts: He stripped the paneling off the vehicle and spent around £4,000 converting it into a roadworthy version of the vehicle . Bare beginnings: The Reliant Rialto was purchased for £800 and stripped back to its chassis; Mr Rothwell made 120 trips from his home to a council rented garage where he made the car between 2011 and 2014; he completed the job unassisted . Winging it: Mr Rothwell made the wings using fabric usually used to make bouncy castles and used electric window motors to motorise them, at a cost of around £190 . The car has even passed its MOT and is now fully legal to drive on the road. Mr Rothwell, from Cambridge, said: 'I've always liked the film and a few years ago I joked with my friends that one day I'd build a trike version of the Chitty car and now I have.' Mr Rothwell, a jeweller by trade, said building the car was a 'steep learning curve', something not helped by the fact he didn't have any designs to go on. He said: I've never even seen the original in real life, so my trike is based completely on pictures from the Internet.' Mr Rothwell built the car on the framework of a Reliant Rialto in a garage rented from the council, travelling back and fourth from his home 120 times between 2011 and 2014. He completed the job unassisted. He said: 'I've never done anything like this before, but I learnt how to do everything, including the upholstery, welding and weather beating.' Mr Rothwell said driving the vehicle brings joy to more than just him. He said: 'We've been out in it a few times now and it's lovely to watch people faces and see them smile as I drive past.'

"It may have been built more than 350 years ago, but it seems some secrets of the Taj Mahal in Uttar Pradesh, India, are still being unearthed. Because a researcher has found a remarkable feature hidden in plain sight - the entire complex has actually been built to align with the winter and summer solstice. The remarkable discovery shows that as the sun sets and rises during the solstices, it aligns perfectly with the four corners of the garden near the central dome. Scroll down for video . An Italian researcher has found the Taj Mahal was built to align with the rising and setting sun at certain times of year, shown in this diagram. During the summer solstice the sun rises and sets at the North corners. The winter solstice sees the sun align with the corners in the South . If you were to stand in the centre of the waterway in the main gardens, where the two pathways meet, on the summer solstice around 21 June there would be quite a sight to behold. Standing in the centre of the gardens, a person would feel as if they were at the centre of Eden - which the gardens were meant to represent - or even the universe. The sun would rise in the north-east corner, rise above your head and then set again in the north-west corner - as if the sun were were circling you. On the winter solstice, around 22 December each year, the sun would rise above the south-east corner, and set in the south-west. The discovery was made by Dr Amelia Carolina Sparavigna from the Department of Applied Science and Technology, Politecnico di Torino. ‘The Taj Mahal complex has a north-south axis,’ she writes in her research, published in the journal Philica. ‘When an architectonic structure is aligned in this manner, it is aligned to the projection on the horizontal plane of the “axis mundi”, the axis about which the world is rotating. ‘However, in their planning, architects could also use some elements aligned in the directions of sunrise or sunset.’ If you were to stand in the centre of the waterway in the main gardens (shown), where the two pathways meet, on the summer solstice around 21 June there would be quite a sight to behold. The sun would rise in the north-east corner, rise above your head and then set again in the north-west corner . The Taj Mahal was built on the banks of Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden in Agra. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal between 1632 AD and 1648 AD . Using satellite imagery of the famous complex, she found that the axis represents the axis mundi. The exact reasoning for aligning with the solstices, though, is not entirely clear. ‘It is well known that the Mughal gardens were created with the symbolic meaning of Gardens of Eden, with the four main canals flowing from a central spring to the four corners of the world,’ Dr Sparavigna continued. ‘Here, we have shown that some of these gardens could have elements of their layouts, oriented to the directions of sunrise and sunset on solstices.’ However, she notes that the purpose of aligning with the solstices may not have necessarily been for symbolic reasons - but instead, practical reasons. ‘Architects have six main directions: two are joining cardinal points (north-south, east-west) and four are those given by sunrise and sunset on summer and winter solstices,’ she said. While other structures are known to have this alignment, the gardens of the Taj Mahal are especially interesting because they are one of the best examples in the world of a structure built to align with the summer and winter solstices. The summer solstice is the day of the year that has the most sunlight, as the sun reaches its highest point in the sky owing to the tilt of the Earth. Conversely, the winter solstice has the least sunlight and is thus the shortest day of the year. The Taj Mahal was built on the banks of Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden in Agra. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal between 1632 AD and 1648 AD. The majestic marble mausoleum and grounds cover approximately 17 hectares and feature a mosque, a guest house, an outer courtyard and its cloisters. Several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have been used to date the development of the Taj Mahal. Masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artists were commissioned from India, Central Asia and Iran and the main architect was Ustad-Ahmad Lahori. The Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical planned building, with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry along a central axis on which the main features are placed. The building material used is brick-in-lime mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi precious stones. A longstanding myth claims Shah Jahan had planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a Black Taj Mahal on the other side of the river. It was suggested Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son Aurangzeb before it could be built. Ruins of blackened marble across the river in Moonlight Garden, Mahtab Bagh, seemed to support this legend but excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discolored white stones that had turned black. Another myth suggest that the hands of the builders were cut off when the Taj Mahal was built, so they could never build something so majestic again - although this has never been verified. While other structures like Beijing's Forbidden City (pictureD) are known to have this alignment, the gardens of the Taj Mahal are especially interesting because they are one of the best examples in the world of a structure built to align with the summer and winter solstices .","Italian researcher found Taj Mahal built to align with rising and setting sun .

"An iconic, oversized piece of movie memorabilia has undergone an incredible transformation after more than 20 years travelling all over the Australian outback. The almost two metre tall stiletto, famed for its appearance in celebrated Australian film Priscilla Queen of the Desert, was stolen and remained missing for around 15 years. Finally, Horticultural designer Sue Leighton has tracked it down, rescued the hilarious high-heel from near-ruin and restored it to its former fabulous glory. ‘For those of you who remember the movie The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert there is an unforgettable scene from the movie where Guy Pearce sits in a Stiletto on top of a bus driving through the Australian Desert,’said Ms Leighton from Ravensthorpe in Western Australia. The 1994 film follows the journey of a troop of drag performers who travel on a tour bus throughout the Australian outback. Scroll down for video . Sue Leighton drove almost 3500 kilometres to retrieve the deserted stiletto. It is the real prop made famous in celebrated 1994 Australian film Priscilla Queen of the Desert . The almost-two-metre high stiletto was on top of the tour bus which toured the outback in the film . Sue Leighton and her friend worked tirelessly to restore the stiletto and then style it fabulously . The shoe was an unforgettable prop in the movie, but after the crew had finished filming they left the stiletto in a small town in the Northern Territory, to the delight of locals and tourists alike. Amazingly, the stiletto’s journey was only just beginning in the movie as it has continued to travel the Australian outback for over 20 years. ‘The shoe has had a couple of lives! It was the shoe in the movie, before it was left with the Kings Canyon Resort,’ Ms Leighton told Daily Mail Australia. For years, the shoe lived at the caravan park in the Northern Territory, almost 500 kilometres from Alice Springs. ‘The shoe was then stolen. All of a sudden it disappeared,’ said Ms Leighton. The shoe’s location was unknown for about 15 years until it was found deserted on a track in Western Australia, around 600 kilometres from where it was last seen. ‘When it turned up, the resort didn’t want it back because it was more than 600 kilometres away,’ said Ms Leighton. ‘The shoe then spent time in an Aboriginal community who painted beautiful artwork all over it. The stiletto has had an incredible history, travelling around Australia. It received many different decorations. Here it is pictured during its time in an indigenous community in Western Australia . The cult classic film starred (left to right) Terence Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving . 'The film is brilliant and the shoe is iconic, I wanted it the second I second I heard about it' said new owner Sue Leighton . ‘Then the shoe was dumped in the desert and quite badly damaged.’ After that, the shoe was adopted at Giles Weather Station on the border of Western Australia and Northern Territory. ‘It was tied up to a cage and out in the open constantly, with people climbing over it which caused lots of wear and tear,’ said Ms Leighton. ‘The local authorities tried to find it a home, but the museum didn’t want it because it would have too far to go to collect the shoe.’ However, for Ms Leighton the distance was no obstacle. ‘From the minute I heard about it, I knew I wanted it.’ ‘I knew about it so I tracked down the shoe and made some enquiries.’ ‘I was so interested because it was an epic film and such an iconic movie!’ ‘The shoe intrigued me and when I knew I was bringing it home I was so excited.’ Ms Leighton and her partner Colin Hughes drove over 3500 kilometres to pick her the shoe in the back of a trailer. The shoe has been decorated with crocheted flowers from the local community in WA town, Ravensthorpe . The shoe even did a stint in Broadway before returning to the red, dusty roads of the outback . Much like the film, Ms Leighton enjoyed their adventure immensely. ‘It was a beautiful trip, it was great to get out in the outback. You learn so much about your beautiful backyard.’ ‘Although our trailer’s not quite as fancy as the tour bus in the film!’ joked Ms Leighton. The resident of Ravensthorpe, a town six hours from Perth, organised a welcome party for the shoe in the little town. ‘I thought there might be 50 or 60 but hundreds turned out, all decked out and looking colourful. Which of course was very appropriate for a stiletto from Priscilla,’ she said. ‘Her first stop in town was to the Hopetoun Jetty where fans greeted her at sunset and welcomed her with open arms,’ said Ms Leighton. The shoe is thrilled to live in her beautiful new town, according to Ms Leighton . ‘Recently she (the stiletto) has been spotted swanning amongst the canola crops and checking out Wildflowers taking in all the colours of the area,’ laughed Ms Leighton. There was a lot of work to be done but for Ms Leighton it was a labour of love which she look to with lavish. ‘It’s a big, big shoe so it’s been a big project,’ said Ms Leighton. ‘My friend and I spent two weekends solid fixing it. It had cracks all through it so we needed to re-fibreglass the shoe. A keen participant in the community’s Art Council Projects, the stiletto’s first styling is inspired by the communities beautiful wildflowers. The shoe has been decorated in crocheted flowers that were created by the community. Ms Leighton’s creative mind is filled with ideas for how she can next decorate the heel. ‘I would like to give a signature to the shoe. It will be some sort of recognition to the aboriginal community who had it for some time,’ said Ms Leighton . ‘I’d also like to see it painted scarlet red and gold. ‘We’re renowned for fishing in town so we could paint it like shark skin.’ After seeing the shoe in person, she has had one major observation. ‘Guy Pearce would have had real trouble sitting in that shoe for that famous scene, I imagine!’","The stiletto from The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert has been stolen, abandoned and missing during an eventful 20 years .

"Spaceflight may be associated with a process of accelerated aging of the immune system, researchers have claimed. Long-term space flight is known to have detrimental effects on the human body, including muscle and bone loss. But now it seems human missions to Mars will also need to develop ways to counteract the negative effects on the immune system in order to keep the crew fit and healthy. French scientists have been testing the effects of microgravity on Earth. They found that long-duration missions, such as to Mars (illustration shown), could affect the immune system. Superficially, prolonged microgravity caused mice to experience changes also observed in elderly mice . The research, published in the journal Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (Faseb), was conducted by several French institutions including Lorraine University in Vandoeuvre-lès-Nancy. The team used a ground-based model called hindlimb unloading (HU), which simulates some of the effects of spaceflight on mice. It involves suspending the back legs of the mice in the air, while their front legs stay on the ground. A shower that recycles water just like that on a spacecraft has been unveiled. Inventor Mehrdad Mahdjoubi, CEO and co-founder of the company behind the product - Orbital Systems - also worked on Nasa’s Mars mission project. Known as the Shower of the Future (concept above), it collects water instead of letting it run down the drain, and purifies it until it's drinkable, reducing consumption by 90 per cent. On the ISS, almost all waste water is recycled to provide the astronauts with a nearly self-sustainable environment. The shower starts at a rather daunting £2,405 ($3,629), but the company claims it will save an average of £212 ($320) per year in waste water. In the study groups of three mice were suspended for three, six, 13 and 21 days - and killed after each test - to test the effects of microgravity. The scientists analysed bone parameters and the frequency of cells that will give birth to B lymphocytes in the bone marrow of young mice, old mice and mice subjected to three weeks of HU. B lymphocytes - also called B cells - are known to be one of major parts of the human immune system. They found that mice in low gravity conditions experience changes in B lymphocyte production in their bone marrow similar to those observed in elderly mice living in Earth conditions. The same effects could be present in humans. While the effects of spaceflight on the human immune system have been known before, this study is the first to suggest that such a ground-based method - namely HU - could be helpful in understanding it further. The researchers also say that their model could be used to test or develop molecules and compounds that could improve immune responses in astronauts. ‘This study shows that a model of spaceflight conditions could not only be used to test the efficacy of molecules to improve immune responses following spaceflight in astronauts, but also in the elderly and bed-ridden populations on Earth,’ said Dr Jean-Pol Frippiat, a researcher involved in the work from the Stress, Immunity and Pathogens Laboratory at Lorraine University in Vandoeuvre-lès-Nancy, France. Dr Gerald Weissmann, Editor-in-Chief of The Faseb Journal, added: ‘Getting to Mars and beyond promises to be a huge task, requiring contributions from almost every scientific discipline. ‘For biologists and medical researchers, knowing how altered gravity affect our immune system from challenges aloft can be already be studied on Earth. ‘Fortunately for biologists, it's not rocket science.’ Currently, astronauts must keep their bodies in shape on the ISS by performing regular exercise. Pictured is Nasa astronaut Sunita Williams, Expedition 32 flight engineer, exercising on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation System (Cevis) in the Destiny laboratory of the ISS on 20 July 2012 . While the effects on the immune system were known before, the study says its methods could be used to develop a solution for missions to Mars to help astronauts who have to operate in microgravity for a long time. Pictured is Bruce McCandless II performing a free-flying spacewalk in 1984 . In March of this year, Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly and Roscosmos cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko will undertake the first year-long stay aboard the International Space Station. The mission is designed to see how astronauts cope with such a prolonged stay in space - previously, crews only spent a maximum of six months aboard the station before returning to Earth. During the mission, experiments will study the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the immune system, in addition to other aspects of human biology such as body chemistry and the heart. They will not break the record for the longest continuous time spent in space - that was 437 days, set by Russian Valeri Polyakov aboard the Mir space station from 1994 to 1995 - but nonetheless, the mission will provide invaluable data for the planned mission to Mars, which could take place in the 2030s. In tandem with this one-year stay, though, experiments on Earth will also prove useful in preparing a crew for the journey to Mars - which could take a total of nearly three years, including nine months travelling there and nine months back. Performing HU studies on mice could be one of the latest ways to gather data for the mission.

"Nasa scientists are developing new nuclear powered rockets that they hope could be used to travel the huge distances needed to take astronauts to Mars and explore the solar system. They believe the rockets, powered using nuclear fusion rather than traditional chemicals, could dramatically cut the time it takes to travel through the solar system. Engineers at the space agency have now been drawing up plans to use nuclear thermal propulsion in a mission to Mars in 2033. The proposed Copernicus spacecraft would use nuclear thermal propulsion to carry astronauts to Mars . Nuclear thermal rockets weigh around half as much as chemical rockets for the same amount of thrust, they say. Their plans were outlined in a series of reports and presentations by Nasa officials and researchers and a presentation given by a senior manager . Nasa has been using nuclear material to power spacecraft for decades. In 1960 a satellite programme called TRANSIT, used to guide missiles from space, was the first to use plutonium isotopes to create batteries. These work by wrapping the plutonium with thermoelectrics, that turn the heat given off by the decaying isotope into electricity. Nasa also used plutonium batteries on its failed Nimbus B1 satellite, which blew up on launch. IN 1972 and 1973 Nasa then launched its Pioneer space probes, which used 155-watt nuclear batteries to keep them powered as they travelled to the very edge of the solar system. The Viking landers, which touched down on Mars for the first time in 1976, also used plutonium batteries to power their experiments. The Voyager probes, which have become the first manmade objects to leave the solar system, also relied upon three plutonium-238 batteries that have allowed them to communicate with Earth for 36 years. The Ulysses sun probe also used a nuclear battery to keep the spacecraft operating while it performed a slingshot around Jupiter. The Galileo spaceprobe to Jupiter's moons also used two nuclear batteries to give it 570 watts of power. The cassini space probe to Saturn carried the largest nuclear battery every launched, weighing 72lbs. The Curiosity mars rover also has a 125 watt battery to help keep the robot moving on the surface of the Red planet. In 1959, Nasa began work with the US Atomic Energy Commission to develop a nuclear powered rocket to carry astronauts into space, but the project was ended in 1973 at the same time as the Apollo space missions. According to their design, uranium-235 nuclear reactions are used to heat liquid hydrogen inside a reactor, turning it into ionized hydrogen gas, or plasma. This plasma is then channeled through a rocket nozzle to generate thrust. Dr Stanely Borowski, an engineer at Nasa's John Glenn Research Centre, outlined how this could then be used to propel a space with its crew through space in a official Nasa paper. He said the spacecraft, called Copernicus, would consist of separate cargo and crewed transfer vehicles, each powered by a nuclear thermal propuslion stage. These would be constructed from a 'core' that use three engines each capable of producing thrust of around 25,000 lbs of force. He estimates that these vehicles could make the 40 million mile trip to Mars within 100 days. It took the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft carrying Nasa's Curiosity Rover to Mars 253 days to reach the red planet. Writing in his paper, Dr Borowski said: 'Recent measurements of the energetic particle radiation environment inside the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft during it journey out to Mars indicate that astronauts could receive a radiation dose of ~0.66 Sv - the limiting value established by NASA — during a 1-year journey out to Mars and back. 'With the potential for the crew to receive additional dose during the exploration phase of the mission, several questions immediately arise. 'Can nuclear thermal propulstion’s performance capability be used to reduce transit times further and by how much? 'The analysis presented here indicates transit time reductions as much as 50 percent are possible.' Nasa first began researching nuclear thermal rockets as part of its Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) programme in 1959. However, the project, which was a collaboration between Nasa and the US Atomic Energy Comission, was officially ended in 1973. During that time, however, engineers produced several prototypes, the most advanced of which was known as a Pewee engine. None of the engines were ever used for flight. A schematic of the nuclear thermal rocket shows how liquid hydrogen propellant would heated by the reactor . This diagram shows how the Copernicus spacecraft could be adapted to different missions and travel times . Now Nasa appears to be hoping to revive the cancelled programme to provide a new generation of rockets to carry its astronauts and the equipment to support them into space. As a nuclear rocket weights almost half as much as a chemical rocket carring liquid oxygen and hydrogen propellant without reducing thrust. This means larger payloads of cargo can be carried on the spacecraft and they can also be made to travel far faster. Under the plans outlined by Dr Borowski, a mission to Mars in 2033 could use two cargo vehicles to deploy surface and orbital equipment to Mars ahead of the arrival of the crew. He said that Copernicus coulod easity manage a oneway trip to Mars in around 130 days but by altering the design of the spacecraft to carry more propellant this could be reduded to 100 days. He says that it may even be possible to make the journey in just 90 days with a crew if equipment and cargo are carried into space in a series of seven launches from Earth. Engineers have proposed using seven launches (shown above) to carry cargo and crew to Mars in 2033 . Nasa's engineers have outlined a number of designs, shown above, for nuclear thermal propulsion rockets . The most powerful nuclear rocket engine ever tested was the Phoebus 2a, which was fired for 32 minutes in Nevada in 1968 as can be seen in the photo above . Proposals to use nuclear powered rockets were also discussed in a recent presentation by Dr Michael Houts, nuclear research manager at Nasa's Marshall Space Flight Centre. He said the nuclear propulsion was a 'game changing technology for space exploration'. He said they hoped to prove the viability and affordability of the technology within the next three years. He said that radioactive isotopes such as strontium-90, which has a half-life of 28.8 years, or cesium-137, with a half life of 30.1 years, could also be used to power the reactors. Nasa could use nuclear fission to power future missions to explore Jupiter and its moon Europa, Neptune and the Kuiper Belt, he said. Dr Houts said: 'Nuclear thermal propulsion is a fundamentally new capability - the energy comes from fission not chemical reactions. 'Initial systems will have specific impulses roughly twice that of the best chemical systems, reduced propellant launch requirements, reduced trip time and beneficial to near-term/far-term missions currently under consideration. 'Advanced nuclear propulsion systems could have extremely high performance and unique capabilities.' Nasa engineers have proposed the above design for the fuel element for a small nuclear rocket engine using uranium carbide (UC2) particles contained within graphite that could be used within a rover or space probe .","Nasa engineers are planning to build rockets powered by nuclear fission .

"David Cameron has often railed against big firms moving abroad to avoid tax, warning they must 'wake up and smell the coffee' to recognise public anger at the practice. So there must have been an awkward conversation over the Number 10 breakfast table this morning after it emerged the Prime Minister's wife Samantha works for a company which is now based in a tax haven. Luxury leather goods firm Smythson, where Mrs Cameron is a creative consultant, is owned through a holding company in Luxembourg and linked to a secretive trust in the Channel Island of Guernsey, another well-known tax haven. David Cameron's wife Samantha works for Smythson, which is has emerged is now based in Luxembourg . The store in Central London’s New Bond Street sells £2,000 python skin handbags. Mrs Cameron has been a creative consultant at the upmarket company since 2010 on a salary thought to be up to £100,000 a year . Details of Smythson's financial affairs are likely to be the source of embarrassment for Mr Cameron, who has warned customers are fed up with the perception that companies do not pay their fair share. Two years ago he took a swipe at coffee chain Starbucks, following revelations it had failed to pay corporation tax in the UK for three years. The Prime Minister insisted individuals and businesses 'must pay their fair share'. ‘Any businesses who think that they can carry on dodging that fair share or that they can keep on selling to the UK and setting up ever-more complex tax arrangements abroad to squeeze their tax bill right down - well, they need to wake up and smell the coffee because the public who buy from them have had enough,' he said in January 2013. Chancellor George Osborne unveiled a so-called ‘Google Tax’ in his recent Autumn Statement, aimed at curbing tax avoidance and stopping multi-national tech companies from channelling revenues into secretive tax havens. A Smythson leather travel set costing £185 and a Panama tote, which cost £550 . Smythson is owned and run by secretive Egypt-born Frenchman Jacques Bahbout, who bought the group for £18m in 2009 through his Italian handbag manufacturer Tivoli Group. Smythson pays several million pounds a year for Tivoli’s goods and services. Bahbout is also looking at selling a stake in the business this year to raise money to expand. Since Bahbout bought the business, the holding company Holdsmyth has paid around £1.06m in corporation tax. But £1m in dividends paid out since Bahbout bought the group may have benefited from the tax status of Guernsey and Luxembourg. Controversy over its tax affairs is likely to intensify as the company has also benefited from taxpayer-backed low-cost loans. The company previously borrowed £2m under the National Loan Guarantee Scheme, a Government initiative for the banks to provide small firms with cheap finance, and currently has a £5m credit facility which is classed as ‘state aid’. Mrs Cameron was previously creative director of the brand until 2010. She took home about £30,000 as a bonus when it was sold. The Prime Minister’s press office said it had no comment to make on the company or its tax situation. Details in the firm’s annual accounts filed at Companies House show Holdsmyth is owned by ‘a company incorporated in Luxembourg’ and is ultimately controlled by ‘Ogier Trustee (Jersey) Ltd as trustees of the Barracuda Trust, a trust settled in Guernsey’. The company did not comment on its ownership structure but a spokesman said that it has ‘ambitious’ expansion plans for the next two years.","Samantha Cameron is creative consultant at the upmarket company .

"Alleged copkiller Eric Frein knew of one of the state troopers who was shot in a shift-change ambush — and he may have believed the trooper was having an affair with his own sister-in-law, MailOnline can reveal exclusively. Alex Douglass, who was critically injured after being hit in the pelvis, lives less than half a mile from the family of Frein's brother and was friends with the fugitive's sister-in-law Melissa. Police say they have ruled out the possibility of an affair after 'extensive interviews' with Mrs. Frein, the wife of Michael Frein, which are understood to have included a polygraph test. 'We have investigated the rumor of the affair thoroughly after we learned about it', Pennsylvania Sate police spokesman Trooper Tom Kelly told MailOnline. 'There is no truth to the affair. Scroll down for video . Rambo: Roman Kamensky took this picture of Eric Frein in April 2009 in Canadensis, Pennsylvania. Frein was looking out of his back window, wearing a Serbian uniform from the 1990s at the time of the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. 'It was what is referred to as an ""impression"" picture,' said Kamensky. 'We take them to create a historical image' Hunt: Police and U.S. Marshals clear homes in the search for Eric Frein in Canadensis on Wednesday . 'We used thorough investigative techniques and questioned Melissa Frein extensively. She denied it and we do not believe she is being deceptive.' Kelly confirmed that Douglass and Melissa Frein are friends and there is no way to know whether Eric Frein believed that his sister-in-law was involved with the 31-year-old trooper until and unless they manage to arrest him. Frein was the best man for his brother Michael when he married Melissa in 2007. Melissa Frein did not return calls from MailOnline. MailOnline also learned that she has recently left her place of employment, where she was an accountant. Her husband, Michael, said: 'I have no comment. Talk to the police' before shutting the door of his home in Olyphant, Pennsylvania. Outside the new 4-bedroom, 2-bath house that the Freins bought in December 2007, the mailbox is festooned with a big blue ribbon, a sign of support for police as they search for Eric Frein. One neighbor told MailOnline he hasn't seen Melissa at the home in more than a week, although he normally saw her every day. However Kelly said: 'As far as we know they are still together, living in the same residence.' The neighbor revealed SWAT teams descended on Michael Frein's home after the shootings and took him away in handcuffs. He was later released and police say his brother is the only suspect in the case. Target? The story that state trooper Alex Douglass, who survived the shooting, and Melissa Frein, Eric Frein's sister-in-law, were having an affair has spread like wildfire through the towns surrounding Canadensis . Douglass is still recovering in hospital, 13 days after he was shot at the state police barracks at Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania as he turned up for work. Another trooper, father-of-two Bryon Dickson was killed. Since then, hundreds of police from all over Pennsylvania have been joined by officers from neighboring New York and New Jersey as well as members of the FBI, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and federal marshals as they search for Frein in woods south of the picturesque Poconos town of Canadensis. Local residents have been turned out of their houses, searched and in some cases had to spend nights in their cars as police carry out their search. Frein, a survivalist, is said by police to harbor a deep grudge against law enforcement. They say they do not believe he will target members of the public but they think he plans to kill more officers. If Frein believed his sister-in-law was having an affair with Douglass, it could help explain why he traveled 25 miles to Blooming Grove to carry out his deadly attack rather than pick a target closer to his home just south of Canadensis. It was on his way back home that he plowed his green 2001 Jeep Suburban into a swamp after he failed to negotiate a junction. He is then believed to have made his way home through thick forest on foot. The story that Douglass and Melissa Frein were having an affair has spread like wildfire through the towns surrounding Canadensis. One person told MailOnline that that is why Frein aimed at Douglass' groin area. Kelly said Douglass was shot 'in the pelvis, around the holster area.' Lawyer Joshua Prince, who has been highly critical of the police action and is looking for clients who claim they have been illegally searched, evicted or refused entry to their homes, told MailOnline that if the affair had been true, state police would have been misleading the public into thinking that Frein was angry at all police rather than just one officer. Taken: A neighbor said SWAT teams descended on the home of Michael Frein, Eric Frein's brother, after the shootings and took him away in handcuffs. He was later released. Cleared: Michael Frein later released and police say his brother is the only suspect in the case . Where is Melissa? Outside the 4-bedroom, 2-bath house that the Freins bought in December 2007, the mailbox is festooned with a big blue ribbon, a sign of support for police as they search for Eric Frein. A neighbor tells MailOnline that Frein's s may have suspected was having an affair with state trooper Douglass, hasn't been seen in days . In a post on his website, Prince wrote: 'What if Eric Frein doesn’t have a vendetta against law enforcement? What if the shooting of the PSP Cpl. Bryon Dickson and Trooper Alex Douglas (sic) was in relation to a love triangle? 'If it is truly a personal vendetta against Trooper Douglas and not the Pennsylvania State Police or local law enforcement, the PSP/FBI should inform the public of this, so that the fear and panic that has been caused by their actions can be quelled.' Prince told MailOnline he believes the state police have already convicted Frein, especially as Lt. Col. George Bivens confirmed on Wednesday that officers are authorized to use lethal force if Frein refuses to surrender. 'The PSP is acting as judge, jury and executioner,' said Prince. 'Bivens has activated a shoot-on-sight order unless he ""actively surrenders."" How does Eric Frein even know about that? If he turns and runs they are going to shoot him in the back."" According to the police complaint, Frein shot Dickson soon after the trooper turned up for his 3-11 pm shift at Blooming Grove. 'At approximately 2250 hours, Corporal Dickson was exiting the front door of the Blooming Grove station towards his vehicle which was parked in front of the station. As Corporal Dickson exited the front door, he immediately dropped to the ground in front of the door where he remained motionless,' the complaint reads. Another trooper, Nicole Palmer, rushed to his aid and Dickson told her he had been shot and needed help. Police say Frein then shot again without hitting anyone. She tried to drag Dickson inside the building but could not. Minutes later Douglass went to help his dying colleague. 'As Trooper Douglass approached Corporal Dickson, he looked into the lobby, at which time he fell to the ground,' reads the police complaint. 'Trooper Douglass was then able to crawl into the lobby' where he was rescued by another officer, Trooper William Fells. Police say a total of four shots from a .308 rifle were fired, all within a 90-second period. Method to his madness?  Police admit that Frein may have believed that Douglass was having an affair with his sister- in-law. Meanwhile, police have discovered Serbian cigarette packets in the woods left by Frein, right . The hunt for Frein has dragged on for nearly two weeks. On Wednesday, Bivens revealed police have found soiled diapers and Serbian cigarettes in the dense forest area where they believe he is holed up. Frein is known to be obsessed with Serbia and has often played the role of soldiers from that country in military simulation exercises. In an interview with MailOnline, Roman Kamensky, an acquaintance of Frein's who took the picture of him in April 2009 in Frein's home in Canadensis, Pennsylvania, says. 'We were all taken aback by this. It is very disturbing and way out of left field.' He says Frein was looking out of his back window, wearing a Serbian uniform from the 1990s at the time of the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. 'It was what re-enacters refer to as an ""impression"" picture,' said Kamensky. 'We take them to create a historical image.' Kamensky said Frein was not totally obsessed with Serbia as he was interested in other historical military periods including Germans in World War II, early Russian Federation and Americans in Vietnam. 'I knew him from the military simulation community. We were in contact over a period of two years. But it's been four or five years since I last had contact with him.' Kamensky said the idea that his former friend might be a cop killer had come as a 'complete shock' not only to him but to other re-enactors. 'Of course I have known people who have had grudges against law enforcement - but he wasn't one of them.' Bivens said survivalist texts found in Frein's bedroom advised him to wear diapers so he could stay in one place for lengthy periods.

"The British teenage sisters who fled to Syria to marry ISIS fighters, have posted pictures of 'self defence training' on social media. Zahra and Salma Halane, both 17, of Chorlton, Manchester left their homes last June after becoming radicalised online. The pictures have been posted on one of the twins' Twitter accounts, and shows four veiled women holding AK-47 assault rifles and handguns. Scroll down for video . In training: One of the Halane twins tweeted this picture, captioned: 'Fun day training for self defence in the Islamic State with humble sisters' Jihadi brides: Zahra and Salma Halane, 17, left their home in Chorlton, Manchester, and joined ISIS in Syria in June last year after becoming radicalised online . Another image shows two women, their faces, bodies and hands covered, making a 'heart sign', and a third is a picture of the shoes of four women. The set was captioned: 'Fun day training for self defence in the Islamic State... Alhamdulilah [thanks be to God] with humble sisters'. Although neither Zahra or Salma can be identified in the images due to their full veils, the set was posted on one of their Twitter accounts. The Halane twins, whose parents hail from Somalia, are thought to have married two ISIS militants in Syria, who have both died in battle. They are believed to be part of an all-female religious police brigade alongside former public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, 20, from Glasgow, who enforce Sharia law on the streets of Raqqa.. This picture, believed to be of Zahra and Salma Halane, was also posted on the Twitter account . Another image showed four sets of shoes, presumably the four women showed in the 'self defence practice' This image showing outdoor shooting practice in the Islamic State was tweeted by one of the girls . Their parents Ibrahim, 52, and Khadra Jama, 45, travelled to the region in November last year, but the twins are said to have refused to come home. Previous tweets from Zahra included messages such as ‘I support the executions of Syrian soldiers. It’s self defence’ and pictures of machine guns alongside the Koran. The pair have 28 GCSEs between them and were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college, but were said to have been radicalised over the internet. Ibrahim and Khadra have 10 children and their 21-year-old son Ahmed is said to be fighting with Al Shabaab, a militant group in Somalia. A senior member of the Somali community in Manchester said  they were ‘appalled’ at the sisters' actions. ‘Everyone is really shocked the twins are still in Syria with these so-called jihadi fighters who are carrying out such atrocities,’ he said. 'We, as a Somali people, are all appalled by their actions but we are also desperately sad for their family.","Twins Zahra and Salma Halane, 17, left Manchester for Syria last year .

"A 20-year-old Baltimore man who punched a six-month pregnant woman in the head four times before robbing her after she fell to her knees has been arrested and charged. Michael Williams attacked the unidentified 33-year-old woman from behind as she was walking to work while an accomplice, who remains at large, served as lookout during the incident on January 24. When she begged Williams to stop, telling him she was pregnant and spilling the contents of her purse out on the street, he replied 'B***h, I don't give a f***!' and said 'don't make me get my Glock!', according to a police report obtained by The Baltimore Sun. Baltimore man Michael Williams, 20, was arrested and charged for punching a woman in the head four times before robbing her after she fell to her knees . Williams took the nurse's iPhone 4, a Bank of America debit card and her keys before fleeing. The woman called police from a nearby home and was taken to the Greater Baltimore Medical Center by her husband, where she was treated for her injuries. She suffered contusions to the torso, face and head and has since been treated and released. The baby remained unharmed, police said. When the woman, who was walking to work on the 400 block of Bretton Place (pictured), pleaded with Williams to stop and told him she was pregnant he replied 'B***h, I don't give a f***!' and said 'don't make me get my Glock!' Williams was arrested after a forensic artist made a detailed sketch that helped the victim identify him, according to WBAL. He faces up to eight charges, including assault, robbery, theft and reckless endangerment. Williams has had prior arrests for theft and destruction of property, but has never been convicted. Officials say he is part of a group well-known for committing crimes in the neighborhood and believe he is connected to other robberies.

"A couple whose baby son lived just 30 minutes is distraught after the only pictures of them together have been stolen. April MacLean gave birth to little Amari last week and was left heartbroken when he died the same day. She and Amari's father could only hold him for five minutes - and photographer Faith Massey was there to capture the fleeting family moment. But hours later, Massey's camera bag and $5,000 worth of equipment was stolen from her car in Charlotte, North Carolina - including the memory card with her photographs. One picture was taken of Amari on a cell phone but the loss of their shared picture spelled fresh anguish for MacLean and her family. Devastating: Amari lived just 30 minutes. A cellphone photo (pictured) was taken of him but the only pictures of the little boy with his mother, April MacLean, have been lost after the photographer's camera was stolen . 'Words cannot explain how I'm feeling right now,' MacLean told DailyMail.com. 'After loosing Amari, Faith helped make sure that we captured all of Amari’s precious moments on her camera shortly after I gave birth til the moment he took his last breath. 'To find out that the camera has been stolen with the memory card full of the last moments with my baby, broke my heart. I've cried til I can't cry anymore. 'The only picture with me holding my baby is in that camera and it was only 5mins I was able to hold him.' MacLean did not want to share Amari's cause of death. Massey explains that the kit contained a Canon 6D, 50mm f/1.2, 85mm f/1.8, and a 100mm f/2.8, but with insurance she can claim that back. What cannot be replaced, she says, are the moments MacLean shared with Amari. Distraught: MacLean said, 'To lose my child and to lose the only pictures we have of Amari can't be explained' Massey shot the pictures for Now Lay Me Down To Sleep, a non-profit organization that provides free professional photography to parents who are suffering the loss of a baby. In a plea to the thief, MacLean says: 'PLEASE, if you are the person who took this camera PLEASE at least turn the memory card in to  Faith Massey, faith@imagesbyfaith.com. 'You may do it anonymously. At this point I don't care who you are. 'To lose my child and to lose the only pictures we have of Amari can't even be explained. Just hurt and heartbroken. Please just give me back the last moments I had with my child.' Massey wrote on Facebook: 'The family is devastated. 'Isn’t it enough that they had to say hello and goodbye to their son on the day of his birth, but to lose the images that will help heal their hearts.'","April MacLean gave birth to son Amari last week, he died 30 minutes later .

Shiao-Ling Lim, Shichida's Australian Principal and Managing Director denied that the early education school promoted 'Tiger Mums'. Coined by author Amy Chua, whose disciplinary rules include no sleepovers, no play dates, no television and no grades under an A, a Tiger Mum practices strict parenting methods which enforce competitive learning at the expense of a child's social life. But Ms Lim assures that the method has nothing to do with Shichida and claims she wants to tell Tiger Mums to 'relax'. 'Children, they can be self-motivated to want to learn, they can love learning.

"Margaret Thatcher tried to stop a senior British diplomat linked to a paedophile scandal being named despite knowing of his 'unnatural' behaviour, it was claimed today. A secret file prepared for the then Prime Minister revealed that Sir Peter Hayman had been engaged in ‘sexual perversion’ for decades and was vulnerable to blackmail by foreign powers. Fears of a cover-up of VIP paedophile abuse intensified last night as the file which has remained secret for 35 years was published showing the extent to which Mrs Thatcher knew about the behaviour of Hayman. The file detailing official investigations into the top diplomat, who was named in Parliament as a paedophile by MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983, shows how Hayman had been engaging in ‘sexual perversion’ as far back as 1966 and possibly even earlier. Briefing: A secret file prepared for Mrs Thatcher when she was prime minister had revealed that paedophile Sir Peter Hayman had been engaged in ‘sexual perversion’ for decades and was vulnerable to blackmail . Briefing: Cabinet Office documents released today show how civil servants Paedophile Information Exchange member Hayman had a cache of obscene material but he was unlikely to be prosecuted . A secret file prepared for Margaret Thatcher (right) revealed that Sir Peter Hayman (left) had been engaged in ‘sexual perversion’ for decades and was vulnerable to blackmail by foreign powers . Yet the depraved mandarin continued to enjoy a glittering career with his final posting being High Commissioner to Canada. The Guardian reports that at one point, Mrs Thatcher amended part of the memo in such a way that it indicated that she did not believe Hayman should be named anywhere. The memo, in a reference to Hayman, said: 'It is the policy of the law officers that persons who have been investigated by the police but not prosecuted should not be named in the House [of Commons], as to do so is to cast an unnecessary slur on the person without his having the opportunity to clear his name before a court.' The Guardian says that at this point, Mrs Thatcher had crossed out 'in the House' - suggesting she did not believe the diplomat should be named. The Stowe and Oxford-educated former Rifle Brigade officer who died in 1992, was a Home and Foreign Office mandarin, working closely with the intelligence services at the height of the Cold War occupying the post of Minister in West Berlin from 1964 to 1966. He was only exposed in October 1980 when Private Eye magazine linked Hayman with the activities of Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) which supported and encouraged illegal sexual relationships between adults and children. Documents: Papers kept secret until they were released to the National Archives today  show reveal Mrs Thatcher was fully aware of the allegation aimed at Hayman . File: Hayman was let off with a caution because the Director of Public Prosecutions deemed the paedophile material sent through the post by Sir Peter and his friends had not been ‘unsolicited’ A secret file detailing official investigations into Hayman publicly released by the National Archives shows how the article sent Downing Street officials into a frenzied panic, amid fears that Hayman’s ‘sexual perversion’ made him vulnerable to blackmail from enemy states. There was also concern that his security vetting never revealed his depraved fantasies about children, which were referred to as a ‘character defect’. The newly released private papers were prepared for the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (pictured) in October 1980 . The Private Eye revelations stemmed from the discovery of a package addressed to a Mr Henderson – a pseudonym used by Hayman – at Hayman’s Notting Hill flat, that was left on a London bus. A police raid on the flat in 1978 uncovered a huge trove of pornographic materials and letters from members of the Paedophile Information Exchange. Among it was a library of 45 substantial diaries in which Sir Peter had recorded in detail his sexual experiences and fantasies, the latter including sex with minors. There was also substantial correspondence with other PIE members in which they shared their otherwise secret desires and other graphic paedophile material. A total of seven men-including Hayman - and two women were named as ‘possible defendants’ in the report submitted by Scotland Yard to the Director of Public Prosecutions. One of the accused was carrying correspondence by a tenth unnamed person who had an ‘obsession about the systematic killing by sexual torture of young people and children’. However, Sir Peter was not prosecuted, leading to claims that his offences were covered up due to his diplomatic role and alleged connections with MI6. He was let off with a caution as the Director of Public Prosecutions deemed that as the paedophile material sent through the post by Sir Peter and his friends had not been ‘unsolicited’ nor traded for profit, no offence had taken place worthy of prosecution. But the newly released private papers prepared for the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in October 1980 reveal that astonishingly no one in the Cabinet Office, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office nor the Security Services knew about the 1978 investigation until the article was published. Lady Thatcher was so concerned about the affair that she wrote to the Attorney General saying: ‘So that there shall be no doubt, I leave it to your judgement whether or not you are interviewed on radio or TV about the Hayman matter. Margaret.’ Papers prepared for her in 1980 show that: ‘The police report showed that Sir Peter Hayman kept explicit and detailed records of his sexual activities and fantasies and that he was a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange. ‘But the only activities which could be shown to have occurred were with consenting adults. ‘The material in the records relating to children appeared all to be fantasy.’ According to minutes by Sir Robert Armstrong, then Secretary of the Cabinet: ‘He (Hayman) had access to highly confidential and sensitive material.’ The files show how Sir Peter Hayman (pictured with wife Lady Hayman) had been engaging in ‘sexual perversion’ as far back as 1966 and possibly even earlier . But the report went on: ‘He has been, to all appearances, a health normal and happily married man.’ It said: ‘It is clear that Sir Peter Hayman was already engaging in sexual perversion in 1966 when he returned from Berlin to the Foreign Office and it must be presumed that he was doing so before that time. ‘He would of course have been especially vulnerable in Berlin. ‘While Sir Peter Hayman was High Commissioner in Ottawa there was a problem of obscene correspondence addressed to a fictitious female name at the High Commission, apparently as a result of advertisements placed in a pornographic magazine. ‘At the time this was laid at the door of a member of the domestic staff, the latest report raises the question whether it should have been laid at Sir Peter’ s door.’ It went on: ‘There must clearly be a full investigation, with a view to discovering whether anything more is known or suspected about Sir Peter Hayman’ s activities while he was serving in the Diplomatic Service and whether there is any reason to suppose that security was compromised. New allegations have recently surfaced from an alleged victim named Nick who claims Hayman abused him at Dolphin Square (pictured) ‘This investigation is being undertaken by the Security Service.’ The Security Services interviewed 14 Foreign Office officials who identified two incidents during his period in Baghdad from 1959-1960 and his time in Ottawa between 1971 and 1974 as being a concern, although colleagues ‘had no cause to suspect that he might be engaged in irregular sexual activities’. ‘One of these will relate to his time in Berlin when he would have been particularly vulnerable if he had been involved in these activities,’ the report said. ‘Nothing has so far come to light from interviews which have been conducted to suggest Hayman’s vulnerability to blackmail came to the attention of hostile intelligence services at the time.’ The review later concluded that there had been no ‘prejudice to security’. However, questions are sure to be asked about how rigorous the police and security services investigation was into his sordid past as new allegations have recently surfaced from an alleged victim named Nick who claims Hayman abused him at Dolphin Square. The file is likely to be of significant interest to campaigners pushing for justice for the victims of historic sex abuse, and may be considered by the current child sex abuse inquiry commissioned by home secretary Theresa May. The paper had remained hidden for 35 years and was only discovered by chance by an academic who stumbled upon the document title while researching secret Thatcher files at the National Archives in Kew. But the Cabinet Office decided to publish its contents. John Mann, a Labour MP who has campaigned on the issue, said: ‘All of these files that have been classified need to be opened up. ‘This one is of great importance.’ Diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, a decorated diplomat who lived a secret life as a paedophile, was named by MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1981 using Parliamentary privilege. The new document, revealed today by Sky News, was written about the same period. Hayman was member ‘330’ of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which supported and encouraged illegal sexual relationships between adults and children. He rented a flat at 95 Linden Gardens, Notting Hill Gate, London under the name of Peter Henderson to store PIE literature and graphic correspondence with fellow paedophiles. But Sir Peter made a mistake and left a packet of paedophile material in an envelope on a London bus. It was addressed to Mr Henderson at Linden Gardens in Notting Hill.Soon afterwards, in November 1978, police raided the Linden Gardens flat. What they found there was a huge trove of paedophilia and other extreme pornography. Among it was a library of 45 substantial diaries in which Sir Peter had recorded in detail his sexual experiences and fantasies, the latter including sex with minors. Even the hardened police of the Obscene Publications Squad were ‘revolted’ by the Linden Gardens haul. He sobbed as he was interviewed and feared he would be exposed and his reputation ruined. And yet he wasn't. Much to the anger and disbelief of the Obscene Publications Squad he was only given a caution.  He died in 1992 aged 77. Geoffrey Dickens also said that an unnamed senior civil servant was helping to run a paedophile ring from Whitehall. The MP claimed the man had at least 57 obscene slides of men having sex with children. He said at the time: 'I'm concerned about the cover-up of a senior civil servant who is a paedophile and wants sex with children legalised. He is a security risk'.","File revealed Sir Peter Hayman had been engaged in 'sexual perversion'

"The UN's top court ruled today that Serbia and Croatia did not commit genocide against each other's people during the bloody 1990s wars sparked by the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. The International Court of Justice said Serb forces committed widespread crimes in Croatia early in the war, but they did not amount to genocide. The 17-judge panel also ruled that a 1995 Croat offensive to win back territory from rebel Serbs also featured serious crimes, but did not reach the level of genocide.

Today's decision was not unexpected as the UN's Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, a separate court also based in The Hague, has never charged any Serbs or Croats with genocide in one another's territory. ICJ chief judge Peter Tomka said both sides had committed crimes during the conflict, including forcible displacement, but that neither had proved genocide, which 'presupposes the intent to destroy a group, at least in part'. But he added: 'The court encourages the parties to continue their co-operation with a view to offering appropriate reparation to the victims of such violations, thus consolidating peace and stability in the region.' The case had been described by Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic as perhaps one of the 'most important events' determining his country's relations with Croatia. Anticipation: A photographer waits for the judges to enter the World Court in The Hague, Netherlands . Zagreb had dragged Belgrade before the ICJ in 1999 on genocide charges linked to the war in Croatia during the bloody break-up of the former Yugoslavia. Serbia was accused of ethnic cleansing as a 'form of genocide' in the town of Vukovar and other areas, leading to large numbers of Croats being displaced, killed or tortured and their property destroyed. About 20,000 people died in the conflict, one of several bloody wars that shook the Balkans in the 1990s. Vukovar was captured after a three-month-long attack by the Yugoslav army (JNA) and Serb rebels. After its fall, about 22,000 non-Serbs were expelled, and about 350 people from the Vukovar region are still reported missing. Belgrade responded with a counter-suit in 2010, saying about 200,000 ethnic Serbs were forced to flee when Croatia launched a military operation to retake its territory in 1995. Following Zagreb's counter-offensive, called Operation Storm, the proportion of ethnic Serbs in Croatia shrank from 12 percent to four per cent. Belgrade was outraged in 2012 when Operation Storm's Croatian military commander, Ante Gotovina (above), was acquitted on appeal before the Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia .

'The irony is that Croatia... which with its forceful separatism, triggered an avalanche of the horrid civil war in the former Yugoslavia, is accusing someone else of genocide,' Serbia said in a statement as the case was being heard last year. The cases were part of the long legal fall-out from the break-up of Yugoslavia into seven states in wars that lasted eight years and left more than 130,000 dead in Europe's worst conflagration since World War Two. The U.N. tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which also sits in The Hague, has long since ruled that genocide was committed in Bosnia, where more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed when the U.N. 'safe haven' of Srebrenica fell to Bosnian Serb forces in 1995. In an earlier ruling from 2007 in a case brought by Bosnia, the ICJ found that Serbia was not responsible for genocide, but that it had breached the genocide convention by failing to prevent the massacre in Srebrenica.","International Court of Justice said Serbia committed widespread crimes .

"It was the anthem which propelled Tony Blair into Number 10 with a landslide majority for New Labour. But popstar-turned-astronomer Brian Cox admits he would not lend his smash hit song, Things Can Only Get Better, to help Ed Miliband's election bid. The popular professor warned he cannot see a 'clear direction' from today's Labour party, in stark contrast to 1997 when 'everybody supported Blair'. Scroll down for video . Brian Cox warned he cannot see a 'clear direction' from today's Labour party, in stark contrast to 1997 when 'everybody supported Blair' In the 1990s Cox was the keyboardist with D:Ream, when the band allowed them to use their song in the run-up to the 1997 election. It proved so popular that the Tories tried to stop Radio 1 playing the anthem because the band gave their royalties to the Labour party. While Mr Miliband has sought to draw a line under the Blair era, Labour struggled has under Mr Miliband to get the public dancing to his tune. At his first conference speech after becoming leader, he walked on to stage to A-Punk by Vampire Weekend, but he has failed to find a signature song since. Cox, pictured left in his popstar heyday, said he would say no if Ed Miliband asked to use one of his songs again . Cos plays keyboards on stage with D:Ream, the Northern Irish pop group, who secured their first number one hit with Things Can Only Get Better in 1994 . Now Cox has suggested Mr Miliband has failed to impress even those who backed Mr Blair two decades ago. Asked if he would allow Things Can Only Get Better to be used by Labour again, he told the Standard: 'I'd probably say no to Labour using the song — there are immense pros and cons to all the parties and I can't quite see a clear direction. 'It's very different now than in '97. In '97, it was obvious that everybody supported Blair. But now I think it's complicated, it's a muddy political climate. I'm sort of apolitical intentionally, because I'm rather a single-issue person, so it's definitely not clear-cut.' He stresses that he has not decided which way to vote and would be influenced by the TV debates - if they happen. But asked if he is more of a fan of Blair than Miliband, he eventually conceded: 'In 1997, I would have said Tony, but I think Tony made some mistakes. So now I'd say Ed because Tony cocked up.' Things Can Only Get Better reached number one in 1994, and was re-released in 1997, when it climbed to 19 in the UK charts. The song became the soundtrack of New Labour's election victory in 1997 which propelled Tony Blair into Downing Street . Mr Miliband's leadership has come under increasing pressure in recent days, with senior party figures from the Blair era warning he is failing to make an impact ahead of the election on May 7. Lord Mandelson warned Mr Miliband's plan to impose a mansion tax is 'crude' and would end up 'clobbering' people. Lord Hutton and Mr Milburn, two senior Blairites, accused the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls of failing to defend the economic record of the last Labour government. Charles Clarke, a former Home Secretary who served in Tony Blair's Cabinet, said voters did not believe Labour would be any better than the coalition. He told The Times: 'The reason why [minor parties have] gained support is because people don't think the Conservatives, Liberals are good and they are not confident enough that Labour will do better. 'Labour's challenge is to ensure that we convince people that we would do better. Stuart Rose, who left M&S in 2010 after turning around the company's fortunes, has branded Ed Miliband a '1970s throwback', in a damning blow to the Labour party . 'In a general way, I think that investment and reform, which was our slogan in the Blair years, is crucial. Certainly, the party has to campaign on the NHS, but it also has to campaign on education, which is another story of investment and reform. 'It has to campaign on transport, it has to campaign on policing and a whole set of other issues.' Mr Miliband has also come under fire from business leaders, in stark contrast to the way Mr Blair wooed captains of industry to reassure them about a Labour government. Former M&S boss Stuart Rose claimed Labour’s ‘business-bashing’ could curb investment and lead to ‘shuttered shop fronts, empty high streets and lengthening dole queues’. His intervention is especially significant because he was handpicked by Gordon Brown to advise him directly as prime minister. It follows criticism from Boots chief Stefano Pessina who suggested a Labour government would be a catastrophe. Mr Miliband has launched a fightback, vowing to 'stand up to these powerful forces' and accusing the Monaco-based Mr Pessina of being part of an 'unholy alliance' with the Conservatives against change. Voters would not 'take kindly to being lectured by someone who is avoiding his taxes on how they should be voting in the UK general election', Mr Miliband suggested. London mayor Boris Johnson defended Mr Pessina's right to speak out, but added it was 'disappointing' that he had moved Boots' HQ to Switzerland to reduce its tax liabilities - prompting Labour to challenge David Cameron and George Osborne to join in the criticism. Meanwhile, shadow chancellor Ed Balls was attempting to build bridges with industry, saying that while there would always be some business leaders who took a 'political view' on issues including taxation, the majority would back the party's policies on infrastructure, education and remaining in the European Union. Mr Balls, responding to claims that a 'bitter war of words' had erupted between his party and business, said: 'The reality is there's going to be some issues in any society which become very divisive politically, and understandably. 'The level of taxation that you levy at any point of time, there will always be different views on that, and whether or not we should have a health service which is predominantly free or whether people pay. 'These are big political issues. here are always going to be some people in every community, including the business community, who take a political view.'","D:ream keyboardist who backed Blair is less convinced about Miliband .

"Two parents left their two toddlers in their locked car in freezing temperatures while they went to a wine tasting, police have said. Jennie Chang, 46, and Christophe Lucas, 41, were arrested in Washington D.C. on Saturday afternoon after a passerby spotted the children inside their Volvo and called 911. By the time police reached the vehicle, their two-year-old daughter was 'crying hysterically' and her one-year-old brother had no socks or shoes on, according to the police report. Neither of the children were wearing hats or gloves, police said in the report. Fleeing: Jennie Chang, 46, is seen running away from WJLA reporters after appearing in court on Monday. She and her husband were arrested for allegedly leaving their two young children inside a car for an hour . When they were found, temperatures outside plunged to 28 F (-2 C), WJLA reported. Their parents were found at an upscale wine bar, Ris, about 400 feet away. Lucas told police that they had left an iPhone inside the car so they could monitor the children. He said that his wife had also been keeping an eye on the vehicle. But the restaurant manager said the couple had been inside for around an hour. Chang and Lucas were charged with two counts of attempted child neglect. They spent Saturday and Sunday in jail before their initial appearance in D.C. Superior Court Monday afternoon, according to the Washington Post. Upscale: They allegedly left their son and daughter in their parked Volvo while they went for a wine tasting at Ris in Washington D.C. They told police officers they had left an iPhone in the car to monitor the children . A judge released them on their own recognizance but they are not allowed to contact their children before their next hearing, which will be held on February 18. They fled from WJLA reporters after leaving the hearing and dodged reporters' questions. Both children are currently in the custody of Washington D.C.'s family services. If convicted, the couple could each face $10,000 in fines and/or 10 years in prison.

"Lego has been voted the greatest toy of all time, with iconic favourites Monopoly, Action Man and Scalextric following just behind. For the first time ever, the bosses of Britain's biggest toy companies have joined forces to cast their votes on the games which they think have shaped the industry and childhoods over the last 50 years. Toy experts from 100 companies up and down the country took part in the study, which is the first of its kind to ask the opinions of leading firms instead of consumers. Iconic Lego was voted the greatest toy of all time in the survey by the bosses from Britain's top gaming firms. Pictured: A giant Lego statue at Legoland park in Denmark (left) and a life-size Shrek sculpture in Windsor . Classic board game Monopoly, which originated in the 1930s, was voted the second best toy in the world . Racing car game Scalextric game third in the survey which was carried out by toy industry website ToyNews . Action Man (left) ranked third in the greatest toys' list, while the Barbie doll (right) also featured in the top 10 . All of the executives were asked to reveal their top three toys of all time, with the only condition being that they weren't allowed to vote for their own toys. Lego was crowned the greatest toy of all time, with all but a few voters putting it in the number one spot. Iconic board game Monopoly came second, with Action Man in third, racing car game Scalextric in fourth and football toy Subbuteo in fifth. The rest of the top 10 was rounded off with Rubik's Cube, Star Wars toys, Barbie, Matchbox Cars and playing cards. Other recognisable names in the top 50 included Kerplunk (joint 11th), Frisbee (joint 14th), Play-Doh (joint 14th), Atari (joint 14th) and My Little Pony (joint 21st). However, popular toys absent from the top 50 list included games such as Etcha A Sketch, Dungeons and Dragons, Pokémon cards and Cluedo. The top 50 also included a few surprises such as Cards Against Humanity, a risqué party game involving playing cards which launched in 2011 after it was successfully funded on Kickstarter. ToyNews, a leading toy industry website, said the survey serves as a celebration of the greatest toys the industry has produced over the last 50 years. Football toy Subbuteo (left) came fifth in the list, while the classic Rubik's Cube (right) ranked sixth . The top 50 also included a few surprises such as Cards Against Humanity (pictured), which is a risqué party game involving playing cards which launched in 2011 after it was successfully crowd-funded on Kickstarter . Star Wars toys came joint sixth in the list, which is the first to be compiled using the votes of industry bosses . Matchbox Cars (left) also featured high in the list, while a classic pack of playing cards rounded off the top 10 . Since it was introduced in the mid-1900s, Lego has developed from classic brick pieces to mini-figures . Lego, which has been voted the greatest toy of all time, was introduced to the world in 1949. The popular toy is manufactured by The Lego Group, which is a privately-held company based in Billund, Denmark. It was developed in the workshop of Danish carpenter Ole Kirk Christiansen, who started making wooden toys in 1932. Just two years later he registered his company name as Lego, which comes from the Danish phrase 'leg godt', which means to 'play well'. He began producing plastic toys in 1947 before introducing them as official Lego pieces to the world two years later. Basic Lego consists of colourful interlocking bricks which can be formed together to create a structure. However, over the years Lego has been widely developed and now features various accompaniments including miniature Lego figures, vehicles and accessories. It can also be bought in a variety of different themes, including towns and cities, space, robots, pirates, trains, Vikings, dinosaurs, and the wild west. As of 2013, around 560 billion Lego parts had been produced and distributed around the world. The Lego brand has become huge since its introduction in the 1950s and has branched out to include video games, theme parks, retail stores, board games, books, television shows and films. Some of the largest Lego sets to ever have been commercially produced include minifig-scaled edition of the Star Wars Millennium Falcon, which contained 5,195 pieces, and a 5,922-piece Taj Mahal. Billy Langsworthy, deputy editor of ToyNews, said: 'A lot of the top toy lists that are about come from surveys of consumers but very rarely does anyone ask the industry experts what they think. 'I'm not aware of any other survey like this one - we got executives from almost 100 of the leading toy companies to participate. 'We wanted to know about personal favourites and also about toys they thought were the most commercially successful, and whether they matched with what consumers say. 'Each executive was asked to pick their top three toys they felt were the greatest of all time then submit them to us. 'A lot of the entries in the top 50 were expected but there were a few surprises - playing cards, although not a brand, featured high up on the list as did roller skates. 'And there were other big names that didn't make the cut – Etcha A Sketch, Beanie Babies and Pokémon for example. Operation, the battery-operated game of physical skill, failed to rank in the top 20 but did feature in the top 50 . Classic word game Scrabble, which was introduced in 1938, featured in the second half of the top 50 . Children's favourite Ker-plunk, which involves coloured straws and marbles, made it into the top 20 toys' list . Trivial pursuit, which has now been developed to include different themes such as Disney and Baby Boomers . 'A lot of the big-name toys from the last 50 years are in there but there's also some newer ones like Cards Against Humanity, which came to life after being crowdfunded on Kickstarter. 'The top vote was Lego by a country mile - almost every single person had Lego as their number one toy. 'The survey is homage to how strong the toy industry has been over the past 50 years. 'We wanted it to be a celebration of all the great toys that have been created by toy companies, and that's just what it is.' Some of the British toy companies which took part in the survey included Hasbro, Mattel, The Entertainer, The Toy Store, Toy Shop UK, Jumbo Games, LeapFrog, MV Sports, Oxford Games and Rainbow Designs. Furby, an American electronic robotic toy released in 1998 (left), and My Little Pony (right) featured in the list . Meccano, which enables children to build model toys (left) and classic Top Trumps (right) were in the top 50 . Fashion doll Sindy, which was created in Britain in 1963, was also voted highly by the gaming bosses .

"Accused murderer Gable Tostee has changed his name to Eric Thomas . Accused murderer Gable Tostee has changed his name in an apparent bid for a new identity. The 28-year-old, who is facing murder charges after 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright fell from his 14th floor Surfers Paradise balcony hours after meeting him on Tinder on August 8 2014, now goes by the name of Eric Thomas. The bodybuilder, who allegedly once told a Brisbane woman on a date that he was named after Clark Gable from Gone With The Wind, got rid of his distinctive title by deed poll last month, The Courier Mail reports. A police source told the paper that the name change came as a surprise. ‘You could understand if all his (legal) matters had been dealt with and he was trying to start a new life but changing his name now does seem quite odd,’ they reportedly said. Tostee was this week placed back behind bars after being jailed for an alcohol-fuelled chase with police across state borders in his father's car. He will serve a six month sentence for his actions behind the wheel while he was driving allegedly up to four times over the legal limit in July last year, just three weeks before Ms Wright fell to her death his apartment balcony. The carpet layer, who had been out on bail for Ms Wright's alleged murder, will spend his 29th birthday behind bars, and possibly in a protection wing to prevent his potentially being assaulted by fellow inmates. Tostee - who turns 29 in just 11 days - pleaded guilt in Tweed Heads court to speeding and being involved in a police pursuit which the court heard reached speeds of almost 200km/h and ended with sparks flying from Tostee’s tyre rims after officers deployed road spikes. He had been over the Queensland border at the Splendour in the Grass music festival at Byron Bay, the Courier Mail reports, and was sleeping in his father’s car when friends woke him and asked him to drive them back to the Gold Coast. Scroll down for video . Back behind bars: Accused balcony murderer Gable Tostee (pictured) is again  in prison - jailed for six months for a drunken car chase with police across state lines after which he was found to be four times over the legal limit for drink driving . The court heard that NSW police saw a Ford Falcon travelling without number plates on the Pacific Highway at about 150km/h ans commenced pursuit, with the vehicle reaching 195km/h when they threw road spikes onto thehighway. Tostee didn't stop. The friction with the spikes caused sparks on his wheel rims before he finally drew up about 1km back into Queensland. A police test of his blood alcohol limit registered 0.2, or four times the legal limit. Before he was sent back to prison, his  barrister Peter O’Connor argued that Tostee was 'terrified' of returning to prison after being ‘brutalised’ in a Queensland jail last year. Dad's car: Tostee (pictured leaving prison last November) borrowed his father's car for a booze-fuelled rise across into northern NSW and then back over the border where he was booked by Queensland police just weeks before he allegedly murdered Warriena Wright on a Tinder date . Tragic death: Warriena Wright (pictured) fell to her death from the 14th floor of Gable Tostee's Surfers Paradise apartment in the early hours of August 8 this year, just days before the 26-year-old was due to return home to New Zealand . In successfully arguing for bail last November, Mr Tostee said he had been targeted by criminals in prison and that he feared for his safety. In the court on Monday, Tostee's parents sat stunned as he was led to the cells by police. He is due in Southport Magistrates Court in March on the drink driving charge. Since leaving the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre at Wacol in far western Brisbane on bail, Tostee had spent most of his time at his family's home at Carrara, west of Surfers Paradise,on strict bail conditions. He has ventured onto social media once and has tried to avoid being photographed or filmed by journalists. His father, Burleigh Heads carpet salesman Gray Tostee and replacement school teacher Helene put up $200,00 surety with their house as collateral for their son to be released on November 20 last year. Tinder date: Gable Tostee (pictured) says he did not murder Warriena Wright,following their meeting via the mobile dating app Tinder in Cavill Mall, Surfers Paradise, then on to his nearby high rise apartment . The Avalon apartments (above) in Surfers Paradise on Queensland's Gold Coast were the scene of the fatal fall by Warriena Wright 14 storeys to the ground at around 2.20am on August 8 this year . At hearings last year, prosecutors said that Tostee's alleged actions in locking 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright outside on a 14th floor balcony was akin to locking someone in a trunk to suffocate. Justice  Mullins told the court the case 'is not in any view a straightforward case of murder'. Mr Tostee was arrested a week later after Ms Wright's death. Following the first, adjourned part of his bail hearing, Tostee replaced his original legal team with renowned Queensland civil liberties lawyer, Terry O'Gorman. Tostee's lawyerssaid that while he was in prison, he was 'always on guard' against fellow inmates. Ms Wright died at around 2.20am, just hours after meeting Mr Tostee at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via the mobile dating app Tinder. Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright. Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a damning police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death. Strict conditions: Gable Tostee was living at his parents, Gary and Helene's house (pictured) while on bail,before he was returned for another lagging behind the bars of a Queensland prison . Fatal meeting: Warriena Wright (above, left) was holidaying on the Gold Coast after attending a friend's wedding, when the 26-year-old New Zealand bank clerk fell to her death from Gable Tostee's (above, right) high rise balcony apartment . Devastated: Warriena Wright (above, right) with sister, Reza, who was devastated by the death . The prosecution claims Tostee has a ‘bizarre indifference to Ms Wright's death’ and that she had been affected on the night of her death by alcohol in the form of a ‘white spirit’ made by him. Justice Mullins has made mention during the hearing of the accused’s autism and social anxiety. Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden told that hearing Mr Tostee was unlikely to have been on the balcony when Ms Wright plunged 14 storeys to her death. Justice Mullins described the Crown prosecutor's case for murder as 'weak' and 'difficult', but said a case of manslaughter would be 'strong'. Justice Mullins said a diagnosis of autism for Gable Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on the night Ms Wright died. 'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' she told Mr Tostee's defence, 'but in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.'

"A student at Miami University in Ohio was shot dead by her ex-boyfriend just hours after she called police to ask them to stop him from coming to her home. Rebecca Eldemire, 21, was found killed inside her locked bedroom at her off-campus apartment in Oxford on Sunday after her roommates reported hearing bangs and her fire alarm going off. The body of 27-year-old Larry E. Tipton was also found inside. Police believe he killed Eldemire, known as 'Becca', before taking his own life, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported. According to their Facebook pages, the couple had been dating for a few years and were pictured smiling together as recently as last month. Scroll down for video . Killed: Larry Tipton, left, is believed to have fatally shot his ex-girlfriend, 21-year-old Rebecca Eldemire, right, before taking his own life in her off-campus apartment in Oxford, Ohio on Sunday morning . On Saturday evening, Eldemire contacted Oxford Police to say that she wanted protection from her ex-boyfriend, Sergeant Jon Varley of Oxford Police said at a press conference on Monday. Officers arrived and stopped Tipton in the parking lot of the apartment where Eldemire lived and on her request, they took him up to the home, Varley said. 'After a brief conversation, Eldemire told officers they could leave as they were no longer needed,' he added, and the officers left. But at 8.45am on Sunday, her roommates called police, who arrived and found the bodies and one gun inside the room, they said. An investigation is underway but Varley said preliminary results suggest a murder-suicide. Tipton, who was from Columbus, was not a student at the university. Eldemire, a double major of geography and geographical information systems, had one parent living in Maineville and another in Columbus, as well as a brother. Together: Eldemire, who started dating Lipton in 2012, had called police to her apartment on Saturday night to protect her when he arrived. But after speaking with him, she sent the officers away, police said . She worked as a student supervisor at the library, and had spent a previous summer teaching students English in a remote village in Tanzania, the college said. On Monday, Eldemire's uncle, Stephen Wright, released a statement on behalf of her family. 'We are deeply saddened by the loss of our beautiful daughter Rebecca,' it read. 'We appreciate all of the thoughts and prayers, but ask that you respect the family's privacy at this time. 'The Rebecca C. Eldemire BEEPS (Betterment for Environmental and Earth Protection) Foundation will be created in her honor, striving toward Rebecca's lifelong goal of creating a more sustainable planet.' Tipton's parents, who are often pictured with Eldemire on their Facebook pages, also released a statement following the deaths, WCPO reported. 'As you can imagine, this horrible tragedy has left our family in shock and absolutely heartbroken,' Larry and MaryBeth Tipton said in a statement. 'To lose our son, and also Becca, whom we loved like a member of our family, is unthinkable. Scene: The next morning, her roommates heard loud bangs inside her bedroom and called police . Probe: Investigations are still underway but police suspect Tipton shot Becca before taking his own life . 'We ask that our privacy be respected as we cope with this as a family and appreciate the prayers and understanding of our friends and community.' Eldemire's death is the first homicide of a Miami University student in three decades, the Enquirer reported. 'This is a terrible tragedy,' said Miami President David Hodge. 'Our hearts go out to the families and friends. It is an incredibly painful and sad time for Miami.' Her funeral will be held in Cincinnati on Wednesday. Her family has set up a foundation in her memory called The Rebecca C. Eldemire BEEPS Foundation - Betterment for Environmental and Earth Protection.

"Many theoretical physicists believe the universe could end someday – and the process is likely to have already begun. While no one knows for certain how it will happen, there are three leading theories dubbed the big crunch, the big rip and the big freeze, that could lead to our demise. Now a Munich-based group, called Kurzgesagt, has put together a video explaining how exactly these theories will bring to end the world as we know it. Scroll down for video . The 'big rip' his would start once the pull of the universe's expansion gets stronger than gravity. Galaxies would tear apart, followed by black holes, planets and stars . They claim all humanity will either slowly decay into radiation, completely vanish after collapsing in on itself or be ripped apart as the universe’s expansion speeds up. In the ‘big rip’ scenario, dark energy could be warping the universe’s scaffolding causing galaxies to tear apart first, followed by smaller black holes, planets and stars. This, according to Business Insider, would take place once the ever-increasing pull of the universe's expansion gets stronger than the gravity holding galaxies together. The universe could eventually expand at the speed of light, and when this happens, the forces holding substances together would break down. As a result, the universe will be empty, holding only single particles that are unconnected to anything else in existence. Several years ago, researchers said the universe is expanding at a rate comparable to a rollercoaster, after they mapped the galaxies for the first time as they were 11 billion years ago. The Big Crunch: . Gravity would become the most powerful force in the universe. The rate that the universe expands would decrease and the universe would start to collapse. The Big Freeze: . In this end-of-the-universe scenario, matter would stay together, but would decay into radiation as the universe expands. The Big Rip: . This would start once the pull of the universe's expansion gets stronger than gravity. Galaxies would tear apart, followed by black holes, planets and stars. Dr Mat Pier from the University of Portmouth explained that the universe's growth when it was young was slowed by the effects of gravity. But in the past five billion years it has begun to rapidly expand because of a mysterious force which scientists have called dark energy. Another potential end to the universe could be through something nicknamed the ‘big crunch’. This could happen if, instead of expanding, matter in the universe decreases over time, causing gravity to become the dominant force. Gravity would cause the universe to shrink. The result would be colliding stars, galaxies and planets as the universe collapses in on itself. And the process could already be taking place somewhere in our cosmos and is eating away at the rest of the universe, according to theoretical physicists. The mind-bending concept has been around for a while, but last year researchers in Denmark claimed they have proven it is possible with mathematical equations. Another potential end to the universe could be through something nicknamed the ‘big crunch’. This could happen if  matter in the universe decreases over time, causing gravity to become the dominant force . This violent process is called a ‘phase transition’ and is similar to what happens when, for example, water turns to steam or a magnet heats up and loses its power. According to something known as the Higgs theory, a phase transition such as this took place one tenth of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang, causing a shift in the fabric of space-time. During this transition, empty space became filled with an invisible substance that we now call the Higgs field. Some elementary particles interact with this field, gaining energy in the process, and this intrinsic energy is known as the mass of a particle. By using mathematical equations, researchers at the University of Southern Denmark have discovered that the Higgs field could exist in two states, just like matter can exist as a liquid or a solid. In the second state, the Higgs field is billions of times denser than what scientists have already observed. In the 'big crunch', gravity would cause the universe to shrink. The result would be colliding stars, galaxies and planets as the universe collapses in on itself . If this ultra-dense Higgs field exists, then a 'bubble' of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at any time, similar to when you boil water. The bubble would then expand at the speed of light, entering all space, and turning the Higgs field from the state it is in now into a new one. The final scenario – and the most likely to take place according to current physics knowledge - humanity could either see a ‘big freeze’ or ‘heat death’. In this scenario, matter would slowly decay into radiation as the universe expands. After trillions of years, even the atoms making up the remaining matter would start to degrade and disintegrate. Stars would dissolve, black holes would evaporate and eventually even light particles would vanish. Ultimately, further advances in fundamental physics are required before it will be possible to know the ultimate fate of the universe with any level of certainty. The final scenario – and the most likely to take place according to current physics knowledge - humanity could either see a ‘big freeze’ or ‘heat death’. In this event, matter would slowly decay into radiation as it expands .","Munich group, Kurzgesagt, has created a video of the leading scenarios .

They really really wanted another child and they were just delighted and really looking forward to the baby coming.' The couples youngest son Benjamin was rushed to The Children's Hospital at Westmead. He is in an induced coma, with head, back and internal injuries. The Milne family were travelling north along Enterprise Drive in Berkeley Vale on the NSW Central Coast on Sunday when their car left the road. The vehicle ploughed into a tree whilst travelling somewhere between 90 and 100 km/h. Sydney residents Darren Milne, 42, his wife Susana, 39, and their eldest son Liam, 11, were all killed in the crash, whilst their 7-year-old son was airlifted to Westmead Children's Hospital in a critical condition. Seven News report that Ms Milne was pregnant with the couple's third son. The seven-year-old crash survivor has undergone surgery for extensive head and internal injuries and whilst he is still critical, his condition has stabilised. Police allegedly 'have evidence that the father Darren deliberately drove off the road and into a tree', according to Seven News. An investigation is underway with evidence being collected for the coroner to determine whether the crash was an intentional murder-suicide or a tragic accident. Nine News also allege that strongest line of inquiry is whether Mr Milne intentionally failed to brake. Susana Milne and her two sons relax during a family day out . Three family members have died and a young boy is fighting for his life after a tragic single-vehicle crash . The family of four were travelling north along Enterprise Drive in Berkeley Vale on the NSW Central Coast . The 42-year-old male driver and his wife aged in her late 30s, along with their 6-year-old son died at the scene . Investigators searched the family's Ryde home and seized a computer and documents. Police allegedly found evidence that Mr Milne had been researching the Berkely Vale road where the accident occurred in the days leading up to their deaths, according to Seven News. Immediately after the accident, Tuggerah Lakes duty officer Inspector Colin Lott said, 'There are many scenarios that could be run by here — it could be inattention, it might be tiredness, so it's far too early to speculate at this stage,' he said. 'It was not a savage turn and the car was only a few metres off the road,' Inspector Lott said. 'Most likely the driver turned to speak to the children.' 'We would be neglectful if we didn't search the house or look for a suicide note,' Inspector Lott said. 'We have to tick all the boxes. Part of the investigation is to eliminate all possibilities.' It is understood police did not find a suicide note but were seen removing other material from the house. Police had trouble locating the Milnes' next of kin, including Ms Milne's family who are in Mexico. Mr Milne was a senior engineer with Ausgrid, wife a fulltime carer for their children who had special needs, both struggling with Fragile X syndrome. NSW police Insp. Colin Lotte told reporters on Sunday: 'It's always a difficult scene for any fatality but to see potentially a whole family lost makes it even more distressing.'

"A mother-of-two whose children suffered cruel taunts from their friends about her size has lost 5st in less than a year to beat the bullies. Emma Thair-White's weight tipped the scales at 15st after she began binge-eating and drinking a bottle of rosé wine a night to ease the pain of the death of her mother Ethel. Emma, 43, from Grays, Essex  was a dress size 22, leaving her with low self-esteem and she would avoid going to the shops for new clothes because she was so ashamed of her body. Scroll down for video . Emma Thair-White decided to undergo a dramatic change of lifestyle after her children were taunted for having a 'fat mum', pictured left, and she lost 5st in less than year, pictured right . Emma's weight had yo-yoed for 25 years after she first piled on the pounds as an 18-year-old and became even heavier after having both her children, Eva, 16, and Max, 10. She admits that her unhealthy habits escalated after her mother passed away. 'I completely lost the plot when my mother died,' she said. 'I just ate and ate and was drinking far too much alcohol - around a bottle of a night. I only found out later that it is the sweetest and most calorific wine. 'I didn't care what I ate and if I fancied treating myself, I would. My favourite was Ben & Jerry's ice cream. I could easily eat a whole tub on my own in one go. Emma, before her weight loss, piled on the pounds after the death of her mother . Emma's weight had always fluctuated but after having children she reached a size 22 . 'I had no self-esteem and didn't care about what I looked like. My weight had yo-yoed before, especially after having my children, but this time I didn't try to lose the weight again and I went up to a size 22. 'I was so ashamed of my body that I took the pictures you can see today of me at my biggest. I thought this would give me the inspiration to lose lots of weight.' The final straw for the shop worker was when one of her children told her she had been described as their 'fat mum'. At the beginning of her weight loss journey Emma took before pictures, right before dieting, to spur her on. She lost 5st in less than one year, right, after her children were bullied about her size . Emma has promised both of her children Eva (right) and Max (left) that she will not regain the weight she lost . It was at that point that Emma, who is married to husband Shayne, decided to make a dramatic change. She began exercising regularly, cut out the booze and completely changed her diet - eating low-fat meals and nutrition bars. And she celebrated her new physique with a £6,000 breast enhancement operation. Emma knuckled down and began exercising regularly by walking her dog Morris, a Hungarian Vizsla. But after several months of hard work she had only lost a stone. She realised she need some extra help to really kick start her weight loss so she started taking a Forza weight loss supplement and soon saw an improvement. Emma now lives a far more active life style regularly exercising and walking the family dog . Emma used to avoid shopping for new outfits but now loves trying out new styles to show off her figure . She took two Raspberry K2 supplements in the morning and then one at lunch - and the weight gradually began to shift. Emma lost staggering 4st in five months. She says that although diet supplements often have a bad reputation she had found them very effective. 'Diet pills aren't for everyone but they definitely worked for me,' she said. 'I don't put anything in my body without checking very carefully first and a doctor I trust said I was fine to take them.' Emma's children are no longer taunted over their mother's weight here the family are pictured in fancy dress after her weight loss with Emma's husband Shayne (centre) Emma lost 70lb in a year - almost 1.5lb a week - going down to just 10st and a shapely size 12. 'I lost a stone a month after I started taking them and quickly got down to my ideal weight.' Emma lost a total of 124cm of fat from her legs, arms, waist and chest. But found that her weight loss caused her breasts to shrink, going down from a 36E to a 34C. In order to regain some of her shapely cleavage Emma celebrated her weight loss by having a £6,000 breast uplift and implants - and she loves her new 34F bust. 'As the weight fell off me my boobs just went. I had always been proud of my figure but I couldn't bear to look at myself in the mirror. 'I have always put my children first throughout all my life. My husband Shayne said to me, ""Just for once we are going to put you first"". 'I am so pleased with my new boobs. They look amazing.' Emma plans to keep her healthy new lifestyle going into 2015 and has promised her children that she won't put the weight back on. 'I want them to be proud of their mum. I have worked so hard to get where I am now. I am not going to let all that good work go to waste.'","Emma Thair-White piled on the pounds after the death of her mother .

"Massachusetts medical examiners have identified body parts found on a beach in Swampscott as those of a 25-year-old woman who went missing in November. The Essex District Attorney's Office said on Friday that the remains found on King's Beach on Wednesday were identified as those of Jaimee Mendez of Swampscott, who was last seen on Nov. 6.

"Darren Scott, 26, allegedly attacked his flatmate with a kitchen knife midway through a massage at his luxury Mayfair flat, a court has heard . A conman plunged a kitchen knife into his housemate's neck  at his luxury Mayfair apartment before screaming 'you're going to die' as the alleged victim begged for mercy, the Old Bailey has heard. Darren Scott, 26, allegedly slashed the man's throat midway through a friendly massage, before stabbing him repeatedly in a scene 'straight out of a horror movie'. The victim, a writer - who cannot be named for legal reasons - managed to break free from the frenzied attack and lock himself in the bathroom, while blood was gushing from his wounds, the court was told. He then banged on the door shouting 'murder', before pleading with Scott to call an ambulance. But Scott screamed ‘you’re going to die’ before throwing a chair at the bathroom door and trying to kick his way through, the court heard. Scott, who had moved into the plush London flat just two weeks earlier, was later arrested while socialising in a jazz bar in Brough, near Hull. The court heard he had used his alleged victim's bank card to pay for the £280 train fare. Prosecutor John Clifford told the Old Bailey how the alleged victim had feared Scott was a ‘psychopath’ due to his 'big, staring eyes'. But he had still allowed him to move into his flat, just one day after they had met online, in July last year. After he had moved in, Scott began taking pictures of the apartment and sending them to his friends, claiming it was paid for by his new employers Procter and Gamble, the court was told. But it later emerged Scott had forged documents, falsely claiming that he worked for the company. Another document showed a £420,000 payment into a bank account that did not exist, the court was told. Scott also allegedly used his new friend’s bank card to pay for the train trip to Hull, as well as to go on a £1,700 spending spree at House of Fraser. The court was told how the alleged incident unfolded after Scott offered to give his new friend a massage at around 9am on July 3 last year. Midway through, Scott said he was going to get some salt water from the kitchen, the court heard. He then allegedly told his friend to lie on his back and put a t-shirt over his face, before changing the soothing music to ‘quite loud and angry’ sounds. Mr Clifford told the court: ‘It was then that (he) became aware that Mr Scott began tapping, trying to find a vein in his neck’. 'The next thing he was aware of, he had been stabbed without warning by Mr Scott in the neck. ‘Immediately he tried to get up using his arms to protect himself from the blows of the knife which continue to rain down upon him.’ Scott, of no fixed address, is on trial at the Old Bailey (pictured) and denies attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud . Mr Clifford said the victim struggled free and locked himself in the en-suite bathroom, while he had blood gushing from his neck. He said: ‘At this stage, he had blood quite literally gushing from his wounds, over the door to the bedroom, over the floor, over the inside of the shower - it was something you would only expect to see in a horror movie. ‘Having managed to get inside the en-suite bathroom, he became aware of a loud crashing sound as if something had been thrown against the door. ‘He was in a state of panic with blood gushing from his wounds to the neck, to the nine stab wounds to the upper part of his body, to the 12 other injuries to his arms and hands, banged on the bathroom wall, crying “murder” repeatedly. ‘Alas, these cries were not answered by anyone at all. During this time, Mr Scott was just outside the door screaming: “You’re going to die”.’ Mr Clifford said the trapped victim tried to reason with Scott, but the knifeman instead broke down crying and refused to call for help. He then said something 'very significant', Mr Clifford told the court. ‘He said: “If you die, then I will get life, but if you live then I’ll only get 14 years"",' he said. ‘That was a very chilling and sinister remark to make, something which you may think says a lot about Mr Scott’s state of mind on that day.’ In the aftermath of the alleged attack, Scott told his friends he had been attacked by potential investors who had pulled out a knife. He took a train to Brough near Hull to stay with a friend, but was arrested the next day while socialising in a jazz bar in the town. After his arrest, detectives unravelled a web of deception that Scott had left in his wake, the court was told. Mr Clifford said the victim had ‘thought Scott was a psychopath' after they had been living together for just a few days, but dismissed the thought because he was ‘intrigued by Scott’. ‘It was during this time that Mr Scott was in effect ingratiating himself to (his victim), and indeed was not only using his bank cards but was taking pictures of the flat, a well-appointed flat on three floors in Mayfair, sending it to his friends, and in effect saying look at my new place, look at how well I’ve done for myself,' Mr Clifford told the court. 'That’s only the tip of the iceberg with regards to the deception carried out by Mr Scott.’ Mr Clifford said Scott had a forged job offer from Procter and Gamble and a bogus letter from the courts service saying he had been given £420,000 in compensation. The jury also heard Scott had been ‘helping himself’ to his alleged victim's bank cards. ‘It is alleged that Mr Scott abused his bank card to purchase train tickets, first class, from London back to Hull where his parents lived at a cost of £280.50’, he said. ‘Mr Scott has pleaded guilty to using a House of Fraser bank card to make purchases in the order of £1700.’ He also had a set of keys with the address of another Mayfair flat written on the fob, the court heard. Scott, of no fixed address, denies attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud. He has admitted a second count of fraud over the House of Fraser shopping . The trial continues.

"The suspect arrested in an early morning robbery in Seattle on Tuesday led police to where he'd stashed the stolen cash: . Between his buttocks.

A 42-year-old suspected mugger led police to where he hid the loot from an early morning stick-up outside a Seattle gas station on Tuesday: between his buttocks . He was booked on robbery charges and a theft warrant, reports KIRO. The thief had pulled a knife on his victim in front of a Shell gas station in the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood at the corner of Broadway and East Pike Street. The knife was recovered and the victim was not reported to have been harmed. However, a knife attack across town didn't have such a humorous ending last month when a 65-year-old employee at a Georgetown neighborhood gas station was savagely stabbed at New Year's. The attendant was rushed to a hospital after a customer called 911 upon fining him unconscious and bleeding from the face on the floor, the Seattle Times reported. Two men would subsequently be arrested in connection with the crime.

"A  Royal Marine officer who met the Duchess of Cornwall has been jailed for the sexual abuse of a young girl. Warrant Officer Tony Jacka, 50, was unmasked as a paedophile after boasting to other sex offenders about his crimes online. The former Regimental Sergeant Major of 3 Commando Brigade repeatedly indecently touched his victim, a court heard this week. Warrant Officer Tony Jacka, pictured here with the Duchess of Cornwall during her visit to HMS Drake in 2013, has been exposed as a predatory paedophile . But prosecutors had previously failed to take the case to court due to a perceived 'lack of evidence' - despite the girl having gone to police. The father-of-two and Iraq war veteran spent three years accessing indecent images of children from his naval base, a court heard. During that period, as second in command of his unit he showed the Duchess of Cornwall around HMS Drake, a service personnel rehab unit. Police later searched his computer and discovered 139 indecent images of children and messages Jacka had sent to other paedophiles bragging about his previous assaults. Jailing Jacka for four-and-a-half years Judge Graham Cottle said the offences were 'completely abhorrent'. Jacka has been jailed for four and a half years for sexual activity with a child, indecent assault and making indecent images of children . He criticised a decision by the CPS not to prosecute him five years ago, when the girl was interviewed by police. The court heard Jacka indecently touched a girl while based at RMB Chivenor near Barnstaple, Devon. Prosecuting, Lee Brembridge, said his victim complained to the police and was interviewed in 2009. But the CPS failed to take the case to court because of a 'lack of supporting evidence' in a decision the lawyer described as 'strange'. Jacka was finally charged with assaulting the girl after police discovered 139 indecent images of children downloaded between 2010 and 2013 while he was at Devonport Naval Base. The Afghanistan veteran showed the Duchess of Cornwall around HMS Drake in 2013 when she visited Hasler Company, a unit for the rehabilitation of service personnel. Defending, David Evans, said: 'For a number of years, [Jacka] was to a certain extent living a lie. He has buried his head in the sand.' He said Jacka was willing to tackle his problems and had 'supported injured personnel with emotional issues'. Jacka, of Ivybridge, Devon, pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent assault of the girl and four counts of sexual activity with a child.

"A radio station director was forced to change the colour of her hair after she was left humiliated by her boss’s ‘sexist’ comments about her appearance, a tribunal heard. John Clayton allegedly told Dawn Carney, 37, that he wished all employees looked like her with blonde hair, ‘big boobs’ and blue eyes. She also accused him of criticising her ‘tacky dress sense and cheap perfume’. The ‘degrading’ comments forced her to change her hair colour from blonde to brunette, an employment tribunal heard. Dawn Carney (pictured) claims her former boss made a series of sexist and inappropriate remarks . The 37-year-old, pictured with blonde (left) and brown hair (right), claims her former boss told her she did not 'look as good' as she did on her Twitter and LinkedIn accounts . Ms Carney pictured today at the Quayside in Newcastle where she is facing her former employer in an employment tribunal hearing . Miss Carney is claiming unfair dismissal and sexual harassment against Mr Clayton, the managing director of Star Radio in Darlington, and the station’s parent company UK RD. She told the hearing in Newcastle that during the two months she worked with Mr Clayton he made a series of inappropriate or sexually explicit remarks. He allegedly told her that she looked more attractive in pictures she had posted of herself on social networks than in person. He was also said to have boasted in front of other employees that he yearned for ‘the good old days’ when he had sexual contact with office staff. Miss Carney told the panel how Mr Clayton made ‘sexist remarks’ in relation to the radio station’s recruitment policy when it was recruiting two sales executives. ‘When discussing the strategy for recruitment, John stated that he wished for the team to all look like me,’ Miss Carney said. ‘He took the comments further by requesting that the new recruits be blonde, have big boobs and blue eyes. He added that this worked in the good old days and they should make sure it happened here. John Clayton (pictured today, right), was working as the managing director of Darlington-based Star Radio when it is claimed he made the sexist and inappropriate remarks about Ms Carney (pictured today left) Mr Clayton (pictured) would comment on Ms Carney's outfits and whether or not he liked them, she alleged . ‘These comments made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I did not like him talking about my appearance in this way. I felt his views on women especially targeted at me as I was the only woman in the sales team. ‘As a result of this I actually changed my hair colour to brown shortly after leaving the business.’ She claimed that Mr Clayton would make sexist comments about women being ‘better at cleaning’ and their role was ‘best at home’. After a period of illness, Miss Carney returned to work in March last year to be told she was ‘no longer needed as part of the business’ and was to leave with immediate effect. She said she was on the point of resigning when she was ‘effectively beaten to it’ and dismissed for her performance. Karen Riley, a former sales executive at the station, said there had been a culture of ‘everyday sexism’ in the office. Edward Legard, for the respondents, said Mr Clayton was ‘professional and courteous’ at all times and Miss Carney’s allegations of sexual harassment were ‘scurrilous fabrications’. He described her claim as ‘wholly opportunistic’. The hearing continues.","Former radio station commercial director sues boss for sexual harassment .

"A mother-of-five went on a night out wearing just her bra, knickers and a coat attacked another woman who tried to help her by suggesting she put more clothes on. Lisa Warner, 36, went out in Worcester scantily dressed in just a bra, knickers and an overcoat in freezing temperatures on January 11 this year. But when Lisa Mills approached her because she was concerned for her welfare in her state of undress, Warner lashed out and grabbed her hair and spat ferociously at the 44-year-old. Lisa Warner went out on a freezing January evening wearing just a bra and knickers but turned on a woman, spitting at her and pulling her hair, when she suggested the mother-of-five put more clothes on . Three people had to restrain an angry Warner so that paramedics could treat Miss Mills for facial injuries. In a police interview, Warner accepted she 'had a drink or two' and 'could not remember very much about what went on'. At a hearing at Worcester Magistrates' Court Warner was given a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay compensation of £50, court costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £15. Mark Soper, prosecuting, told the court: 'Miss Warner was wearing underwear with a coat over the top. 'Her son was trying to get her to go back to her home address. It was quite a cold night. 'Miss Mills and her friend approached the defendant to suggest she go home because of the temperature and her lack of clothing at which point Miss Warner turned on Miss Mills. Warner had been at the Punch Bowl pub in Worcester when the row between the women took place . Warner had gone out to the pub in Worcester scantily clad and later admitted she 'had had a few drinks' 'She reached her arms up over the railing to try and slap Miss Mills over the head. 'She stood up on the lower wall, bent over the railing and quite simply she spat at Miss Mills. It landed on her shoulder. 'She grabbed her by the hair, pulling her forcefully and held onto her for two minutes. 'It took three people to remove Miss Warner from attacking Miss Mills.' Warner has two previous convictions, a public order act offence in 2008 and sending an indecent or an offensive message from 2012. The court heard Warner spat at Miss Mills and pulled her hair, clutching at the strands for two minutes . Mark Lister, defending, said Warner lived next door to Miss Mills' father. He said 'There are ongoing issues between the families. 'Miss Mills did not have any need to speak to Miss Warner at all. 'It is unfortunate she got involved. 'Miss Mills was the author of her own misfortune in this. She (Warner) bitterly regrets what happened and asks you to accept her apology.'","Lisa Warner went out wearing a bra, knickers and coat on freezing evening .

"Europe's busiest royals, Queen Letizia and King Felipe of Spain, were all smiles this afternoon as they attended their second public engagement in 24 hours. Today, the monarchs attended a meeting with members of The Royal Theatre Foundation at the Royal Palace. Sticking to what suits her, the 42-year-old Queen wore a blazer that was remarkably similar in colour to the plum one she wore yesterday and she even stuck to the same shade of lipstick. Scroll down for video . King Felipe VI of Spain and Queen Letizia of Spain attend a meeting with members of The Royal Theatre Foundation at the Royal Palace . But while her blazer was near-identical, Letizia swapped yesterday's matching plum skirt for a grey pencil skirt, grey suede court shoes and a purple top. She completed her polished look with delicate pearl earrings. Her husband wore his trademark grey suit with a light pink tie and brown shoes. The pair proved that they're still very much in love, sharing private jokes and a few quiet words as they awaited their guests. But once members of the foundation arrived, the royal power couple put on their professional front, greeting each one in turn. Guests at the event included  Esperanza Aguirre - a Spanish politician and former President of Madrid - and the Peruvian writer, Mario Vargas Llosa. The couple, who are clearly still very much in love, exchanged a private joke as they waited for their guests .

King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia look poised and polished during the reception for the members of Patronage of the Royal Theatre at Palacio de la Zarzuela in Madrid . This was the pair's second public engagement in two days . Just yesterday the Spanish monarch joined her husband at the ceremony of the Gold Medal of Merit in Fine Arts Ceremony at El Pardo Palace in Madrid, Spain. The 42-year-old, who had clearly carefully co-ordinated her outfit, matched her lipstick and accessories to her clothes. Despite cramming in several royal duties over the past few weeks - as well as helping her husband celebrate his birthday on Friday - the monarch was practically glowing as she presented awards at the event. The couple beamed and applauded as they handed out awards to creatives and proved they're still very much in love as they gazed longingly into each other's eyes. The couple are barely seen apart. At the end of last week, the couple visited the FITUR International Tourism Fair in Madrid when a well-wisher in a grey robe approached, brandishing a map.

Ever composed, Letizia and husband King Felipe, who celebrated his 47th birthday on Friday, smiled broadly at the man before inspecting the map and moving on. Before that, she compered a meeting of the Spanish Association Against Cancer, an organisation of which she is president. Since taking the throne in June 2014 after former King Juan Carlos tearfully signed his abdication papers following a 36-year reign, Spain's Felipe and Letizia have become two of Europe's most popular royals. But Felipe and Letizia have been lauded for their hard work, the couple, who have two daughters, Leonor, nine, and Sofia, seven, have also been praised for their good looks and impeccable dress sense. Felipe, 46, became engaged to 42-year-old Letizia Ortiz y Rocasolano, an award-winning broadcast journalist in 2003, after meeting when she carried out an interview with him. The couple married a year later in 2004 at the Almudena Cathedral, Madrid, in a ceremony that was beamed around the world - with over 25 million viewers in Spain alone tuning in. Since then, Letizia has become a global style icon thanks to her penchant for mixing home-grown labels and the high street. Favourites include slim-fitting sheath dresses picked up in Mango, Zara and Uterqüe - many of which she wears time and time again.","Queen Letizia, 42, wore a near-identical plum jacket to an event yesterday .

"Charges could be dropped or greatly reduced against two young sisters accused in the fatal shooting of their 16-year-old brother, the lead prosecutor said on Tuesday. Third Circuit State Attorney Jeff Siegmeister said he'll make a final decision about charges after a Thursday court hearing, which will also address options for the girls' care, given both of their parents were being held in jail. The January 5 shooting resulted in the arrests of a 15-year-old girl and her 11-year-old sister on second-degree murder charges in Lake City, Florida. A 15-year-old girl (left) and her 11-year-old sister (right) are facing murder charges after the eldest girl fatally shot her 16-year-old brother at their Florida home last month. It was announced today that the charges could be greatly reduced after the eldest girl suffered years of physical and sexual abuse . Documents show the elder girl had suffered years of physical and sexual abuse. In documents seen by Daily Mail Online last month, the eldest girl had been sexually abused for years by an uncle. In 2011, the brother and sister were discovered having sex by their mother. Investigators said the elder girl was held in a locked bedroom by her older brother while their parents were away on a work trip. The father, a truck driver, and his wife, who often went with him, left the 16-year-old boy to watch over the girls and their three-year-old sister, police said. After the brother fell asleep, the girl convinced the younger sister to unlock the door so she could shower, police reports stated. The elder sister asked the younger to keep watch while she climbed through the window of her parents' locked bedroom, where she retrieved a pistol, police said. With gun in hand, the girl asked her younger sister to take their three-year-old sister and hide in a closet before she shot her brother in the neck as he slept, police said. The two older girls fled the house, leaving the toddler behind. They were later found by police outside a Dollar General store after the younger girl called a friend saying she needed a ride. Documents show the elder girl was locked in her bedroom regularly for days with only a blanket and a bucket to use the bathroom. Her parents had also removed her from school, documents show. The longest they kept the girl locked in her room was 20 consecutive days, the father told police. In the room, police found only a blanket and a bucket filled with urine in the closet, allegedly a punishment because the teenage girl was stealing and talking back. The boy, 16, was shot dead by his sister on January 5. The mother had earlier caught the brother and sister having sex . Letters from the parents asking her why she should be let out of that room were also found in the police investigation. 'It was learned that (the 15-year-old girl) has made past attempts at ending her life but neither law enforcement nor (emergency management services) was notified,' police wrote in their January report. Police documents released last month said the eldest girl's uncle was convicted of molesting her in 2010. The uncle was arrested in December 2010 on sex charges after his wife found a USB with movie clips of him and the 15-year-old engaged in sexual acts. It had been going on for some time. According to police documents, his wife reported seeing a video clip of the girl sitting down and a man with his penis out, standing behind her. He then had oral sex with the underage girl, while she made noises, the wife told police. The victim later told investigators that she did not want it to happen. The uncle had told her to 'suck on his thingy' and that 'they were to be private and not to tell anyone no matter what'. The abuse had been going on 'for a long time', according to the police report, and the videotaping for about a year. The uncle was convicted and is on the registered sex offender's list. Police documents also revealed that the children's mother discovered the siblings having sex in 2011. The mother reported to police that she heard noises coming from the bedroom and found the teenage boy having sex with his sister, who is a year younger. The mother told police that she separated the siblings and asked them what happened. The girl told her mother that she did not want to 'do it'  with her brother but he put pressure on her. She also referenced the earlier abuse by her uncle. Siegmeister said the alleged abuse and neglect, along with the girls' ages, are being considered in any charges. If they were convicted as juveniles of second-degree murder the pair would spend until their 21st birthdays in prison. The parents currently face charges of felony child neglect, and the 3-year-old is being cared for by child welfare officials. The members of the family are not being named because of the girls' ages and because of abuse allegations. The parents have been charged with child neglect and failing to supervise. The girls' mother told police that they often locked the 15-year-old girl up when she misbehaved .","The January 5 shooting resulted in the arrests of two sisters on second-degree murder charges in Lake City, Florida .

"Ricardo Medina Jr will not be charged, police said today, after he was accused of fatally stabbing his roommate . A former Power Ranger will not be charged after being accused of stabbing his roommate to death with a replica medieval sword in a row over his girlfriend. Ricardo Medina Jr, who played the Red Ranger, reportedly told officers that he stabbed Joshua Sutter after he forced his way into his bedroom during the fight. Prosecutors said on Tuesday that Medina will not be charged but did not reveal other details. Sutter was said to have been angry that Medina's girlfriend was spending too much time at their home when the former Power Ranger was not there, TMZ reported. The 37-year-old has been charged with killing his roommate by stabbing him in the abdomen with the sharp weapon on Saturday afternoon. Medina, who reportedly called 911 himself, was taken into custody in Palmdale, California, shortly after, reports claim. Sutter was taken to hospital and pronounced dead. The roommates started fighting at around 3.30pm, according to reports. Medina went into his room with his girlfriend but Sutter tried to follow them. It was then that Medina had allegedly dealt the fatal blow. Medina starred in the 2002 TV series Power Rangers Wild Force before playing Deker in the 2011 series Power Rangers Samurai. He also voiced Deker in the video game Power Rangers Samurai, and in the movie Power Rangers Samurai: A New Enemy, which hit theaters in 2012. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, Medina was also pursuing a singing career and had stints in ER and CSI, according to his IMDb profile. 'He is a great friend and a great client. It's something I can't even conceive. I don't see that in him. 'He was a very helpful guy and great with his dog. It's such a shock,' said Gar Lester, Medina's former agent who has known the actor for 12 years, told ABC7. Medina's neighbor, Justin Adamson, said the actor had moved into the block about two months ago. He told ABC7: 'We brought him some bread and just tried to interact a little bit with him, but he was more of the, you know, the type of guy that didn't really want to communicate.'

"Death row inmate Donald Newbury pictured in 2003 . A member of a notorious gang that escaped from a Texas prison is scheduled for execution this week for killing a suburban Dallas police officer. The murder took place more than 14 years ago when the seven fugitives held up a sporting good store in Huntsville, Texas. Donald Newbury, 52, on Wednesday evening would be the third member of the 'Texas 7' to be executed since they were hunted down in Colorado six weeks after pulling off the largest prison escape in Texas. The gang broke out of the Connally Unit in South Texas in December 2000. Attorneys for Newbury have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to put off his lethal injection. A 29-year-old Irving police officer, Aubrey Hawkins, was gunned down as the gang robbed the store late on Christmas Eve in 2000. Last week the state of Ohio postponed the execution of seven death row inmates following several botched lethal injection killings across the country last year. Two of the other Texas 7 have already been executed, three others are awaiting execution and one committed suicide before being captured by law enforcement. Michael Anthony Rodriguez and George Angel Rivas have already been executed, Joseph Garcia, Randy Ethan Halprin and Patrick Murphy are awaiting execution. Larry James Harper killed himself at the time of the escape. Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (DRC) said it had put a hold on the executions while it secured new lethal injection drugs. Earlier this month, the department revised its drug protocol following the bungled January 2014 execution of Dennis McGuire, who appeared to be gasping for air during the process that lasted 26 minutes, instead of the expected 10 minutes. The drug cocktail used to kill McGuire included the sedative midazolam, which is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and has been used in several bungled executions in the United States.

"The teenage daughter of one of Australia's richest men is challenging her father's will in court after claiming she is entitled to a $2.5 million house, a $100,000 wedding, a diamond encrusted grand piano and two cars. Olivia Jacqueline Mead, 19, claims that a $3 million trust fund left to her when her iron ore magnate father Michael Wright died in 2012 is inadequate, The Australian reports. Mr Wright was estimated to be worth $1.5 billion when he died and was the son of Peter Wright, who co-founded Hancock Prospecting and Wright Prospecting with Lang Hancock - Gina Rinehart's father. Olivia Jacqueline Mead, 19, claims that a $3 million trust fund left to her when her iron ore magnate father Michael Wright (pictured) died in 2012 is inadequate . The late mining heir was married four times and fathered three children, two of whom are involved in the Western ­Australia family business. Ms Mead is now suing her father's other two children  - Leonie Baldock and ­Alexandra Burt - and the executor of her father's will, David Lemon. In a summons filed in December 2012, Ms Mead claims to have been left without adequate funds for her proper maintenance, support, education and advancement in life from her father's estate. The matter was heard in the Supreme Court of Western Australia on Monday. The 19-year-old claims she will need a home five times the Perth median price ($2.5 million), $10,000 each year for fashion accessories including Tiffany and Co sunglasses and $100,000 for a wedding when she ties the knot. Her list of claims also included an Audi A4 and a Toyota Tarago for when she has children, as well as a diamond-encrusted bass guitar worth $250,000 and a limited ­edition Kuhn Bosendorfer grand piano. Ms Mead is now suing her father's other two children - Leonie Baldock and ­Alexandra Burt - and the executor of her father's will, David Lemon. The matter was heard in the Supreme Court of Western Australia on Monday . Ms Mead claimed in court she will need $300 a week for utilities, $800 a week for food and alcohol, $150 a week for fine wine and $300 a week for clothing. The university student, who appeared in court on Monday, said her relationship with her father was 'sporadic'. The defendants in the matter are executor David  Lemon, Leonie Angela Maynard Baldock, Alexandra Odette Burt and VOC Group Ltd. Ms Baldock, who is also Mr Wright's daughter, took over the reins at Wright Prospecting shortly after he died when she was aged 40. The VOC Group is related to the Voyager Estate winery in Margaret River bought by Mr Wright - who was reportedly not a drinker - in 1991. The matter continues in the WA Supreme Court.

"Members of the United Nations' aviation agency are holding high-level safety talks for only the second time in 70 years after hundreds of air passengers and crew were killed in a series of high-profile tragedies in 2014. The disastrous year has prompted government and aviation officials from dozens of countries to gather in Montreal this week for an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) assembly to discuss the risks of flying over conflict zones and how to prevent planes from vanishing. Malaysia is leading a push for sweeping changes after its state-owned flag carrier, Malaysia Airlines, suffered two air disasters within five months last year. Malaysia wants mandatory reporting of conflict zone risks after a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down . The Southeast Asian country is pushing for real-time aircraft tracking and calling on the UN to force its member states to warn airlines about the risks of flying over conflict zones. One of Malaysia Airlines' planes disappeared and has not been located, and another was shot down over eastern Ukraine, where the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian rebels are still involved in a heavy battle for territory. All 298 passengers and crew were killed when flight MH17 was shot down while flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur last July. Since that incident the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has faced pressure to develop new systems to share intelligence and warn airlines about new threats associated with conflict zones. All 298 passengers and crew were killed when flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine . Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, director general of Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation, said a proposal to create a central website where states and agencies could voluntarily publish warnings does not go far enough. Speaking at the ICAO assembly, he was quoted by Reuters as saying that reports from ICAO member states should be ‘mandatory and timely’. He added: ‘We cannot delay implementing changes in the way global commercial aviation operates.’ The ICAO’s proposal is backed by the US and Netherlands, which lost 196 citizens when flight MH17 went down. The International Civil Aviation Organization is holding its second high-level safety conference in 70 years . The Netherlands also wants airlines to tell passengers before take-off whether their flight will cross a conflict zone. The US said MH17 was hit with a ground-to-air missile fired by rebels, but Russia insists that the aircraft was shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet. It was flying at about 33,000ft after Ukraine had warned airlines to remain above 32,000ft. Malaysia is also pushing for real-time aircraft tracking to become an industry standard, despite the costs. Search teams have found no trace of flight MH370 despite scouring 25,000 square miles of ocean . It follows the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which was carrying 239 people from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Despite extensive search efforts in the Indian Ocean teams have been unable to find any debris or the plane’s black boxes. In a working paper presented to the assembly, Malaysia said: ‘We believe, based on our unfortunate experience, (it) will be offset by the benefits of enhancing the effectiveness of the alerting and search and rescue services. ‘The disappearance of MH370 demonstrates the crucial need to improve aircraft tracking systems for the sake of safety and security. The ICAO assembly is likely to endorse a plane tracking system that sends signals every 15 minutes . ‘In this day and age, the fact that an aeroplane could go missing and that the flight recorders could be so difficult to recover is unacceptable.’ Despite Malaysia’s demands the ICAO conference is likely to back a less-costly system that sends tracking signals every 15 minutes, but would increase the intervals to every minute in an emergency or if a plane deviates from its route. Current standards require long-haul flights over water to report their position about every 45 minutes. Delegates are also studying how ejectable and buoyant black boxes would assist rescuers and investigators when a plane crashes.","More than 500 were killed in two tragedies involving Malaysia Airlines .

Even my grandfather who's in his 90s got to see it': She'll make her Super Bowl debut this Sunday on NBC with her steamy Carl's Jr. commercial . Saucy: Charlotte McKinney appears in the advert for the 'All Natural' Carl's Jr. burger . Famous footsteps: Charlotte follows in the footsteps of supermodel Heidi Klum, Kate Upton, Kim Kardashian and even Paris Hilton . At parties Charlotte says: 'The girls would throw beer at me, just because I was the prettier girl in high school' 'But it was hard for me, when I was 14 I was growing into my body and I had these boobs, I didn't know what to do with them! But I just knew I was above it all, I have an older sister, Garland, who has my back and these girls didn't matter.' Speaking about her decision to drop out of school, she says that she also suffered because she is dyslexic, admitting: 'I've had such a hard time with dyslexia my whole life. When I was a child I didn't learn to read until I was a lot older and I was behind in my classes, it was such a challenge. 'Whenever people talk about dyslexia, it's important to know that some of the smartest people in the world,  major owners of companies, are dyslexic. We just see things differently, so that's an advantage. I just learn a different way, there's nothing bad about it.' Charlotte's parents Susan and Terry were always there for her, she says, and fully supported her when she left school. 'Most parents would be bummed out, but my parents knew I was on the right track, I knew what I had to do to be successful. 'I'm only 5ft 7ins tall and for modelling that's small, so I wasn't getting signed, but I kept on pushing.' Charlotte won the Carl's Jr. role, following in the footsteps of Kate Upton, Nina Agdal, Kim Kardashian and and Heidi Klum, after they approached her management and has already snared a campaign for Guess, who discovered her on her social media accounts. And now she's hoping her dream of appearing in Sports Illustrated's fabled swimsuit issue will come true. She said: 'That's been my goal my whole life, to me, that's so iconic.'

Moving onwards and upwards, Charlotte has already filmed the sequel to Joe Dirt with David Spade, produced by Adam Sandler's production company Happy Madison. Asked about constantly being compared to her fellow Carl's Jr. model Kate Upton, Charlotte says: 'I'm taking it on the chin, hopefully it will ease off soon, it's such a compliment to me, but just because we have boobs and we're blonde it doesn't mean we're the same!' Advertisers are known to dish out an eye-popping $8M for just one minute of air time during the football game - which drew 111.5M viewers last year - while 30-second spots cost $4M. In the All-Natural Burger advert for Carl's Jr.  Charlotte seemingly struts 'au naturel' through a farmers market. '[My dad] friggin' loved it,' Charlotte told People of the racy advert.

'Even my grandfather who's in his 90s got to see it. They all loved it.' The real-life pin-up then takes a big bite out of the $4.69 patty boasting no antibiotics, hormones, or steroids. And though McKinney admits to eating burgers once in a while, she spends far more time doing Pilates, hot yoga, and weight training. However, she told Daily Mail Online she DID eat her burger while filming, saying: 'I ate small bites, as it was a long shoot, but I definitely ate it!' As for her love life, Charlotte said she is 'having fun', but is NOT dating anyone seriously (yet). Meanwhile, it was revealed today that Superbowl XLIX has the highest ratings in Superbowl history.

"A five-year-old schoolgirl has been hailed a hero after she made a tearful 999 call to save her mother's life when she collapsed in the family home. Sienna Adderley's mother Katie, 32, was getting her ready for school when she collapsed and started shaking in her kitchen in Rugby, Warwickshire. With no one else around Sienna picked up the phone and called the emergency services - remaining calm enough through her sobs to tell the operator her mother's symptoms. Scroll down to listen to the 999 call . Little hero: Sienna Adderley's mother Katie, 32 (right) was getting her ready for school when she collapsed and started shaking in her kitchen in Rugby, Warwickshire. Sienna (left) sprang into action and called 999 . Collected: Sienna, pictured at home with her mother, remained calm enough through her sobs to tell the operator her mother's symptoms. She was too small to open the front door to emergency service workers . The call, which has been released by emergency services with the permission of Sienna's family, captures the moment she came to her mother's aid. 'I can't wake her up,' she told the operator. 'She is collapsed on the floor and now she is shaking. She is lying in the kitchen'. Because Sienna was too small to open the door, emergency services pinpointed her mother's address before breaking in and treating her during the incident last Thursday. Sienna, who attends Eastlands Primary School in Rugby, said: 'My mummy was in the kitchen and I was watching CBeebies when she collapsed. 'It was very scary but my dad told me if she got poorly when I wasn't there then I should call 999. 'I told them where I lived and had to look after my brother too. I was crying but tried not to be frightened. 'When the police came a lady policewoman took me upstairs and we played with my toys in my room while they made her better. Brave: Sienna said her father had told her to phone 999 if her mother 'got poorly' when he wasn't there . 'Everybody is saying I'm very brave, which is very nice. I'm glad I helped my mummy because I love her lots.' Mrs Adderley, a former playschool supervisor who also has a two-year-old son Riley with partner Carl Green, 33, was treated at the scene and said she had her daughter to thank. She taught Sienna how to dial 999 because she had suffered similar collapses in the past. Doctors initially thought she might have epilepsy, but are still attempting to diagnose her condition. 'My husband and I have always encouraged Sienna to be involved if I'm ill so she would not be worried and would know what to do,' she said. 'Thank goodness Sienna was here to help me. You don't know what might happen to you if you don't get the treatment you need. 'Usually Sienna would call her daddy but she had no answer, so she decided to ring 999. She has never had to ring them before although we did show her what to do in the past. 'She sounds very distressed but by the end of call she sounded very confident and she was pretty calm considering the circumstances. 'She was very brave and I am so proud of her. Not only was she trying to see to me, she had her little brother to look after as well. She is our little hero.' Mrs Adderley added the community has pulled together to raise £900 for a new front door. It was the first time Sienna had called 999. Police have described her as a 'superstar' and are planning to present the brave youngster with a certificate at a school assembly. PC James Graham, who attended the incident, added: 'Police officers from Rugby Response and Safer Neighbourhoods Team attended an incident reported by a 999 call. 'The caller was five-year-old Sienna reporting that her mum was ill. Operator: A 999 control centre (file image). PC James Graham, of Warwickshire Police, said: 'All the attending officers thought Sienna was fantastic and a superstar. She just took it all in her stride' 'That in itself is amazing but she also stayed on the line while checking her mum and looking after her younger brother. 'All the attending officers thought she was fantastic and a superstar. 'She just took it all in her stride. She deserves recognition for her actions and her parents are rightly proud of her. 'Sienna used the 999 service, exactly how it is meant to be used, and is a shining example to others. 'We would encourage other parents to teach their children from an early age, how and when they should call 999, as this incident show's how vital it can be should an emergency arise.' A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were called by police to Brodie Close in Rugby to treat a woman following a medical incident. 'She received treatment by paramedics and recovered whilst at home. 'We learned from our police colleagues that the patients five year old daughter had raised the alarm by calling 999 and we would like to congratulate her on her brave actions. 'All parents are asked to teach their children about calling 999 in an emergency as one day it may just save someone's life.' Harrowing: A 999 operator spoke to Sienna as she described her mother's symptoms (file photo) Sienna: I am trying to wake her up but I can't. Operator: You are trying to wake her up but you can't? Sienna: Yeah . Operator: Alright, Sienna, okay. We will see if we can get somebody round straightaway. Where is mummy now? Is she upstairs in bed? Sienna: Collapsed on the floor. Operator: She is collapsed on the floor? Sienna: And now she is shaking. Operator: Now she is shaking? Sienna: Yeah . Operator: (to colleague) Okay, ambulance 58 please Natalie (to Sienna) Alright Sienna, just stay on the line for me. So where is mummy now then? Sienna: She is lying in the kitchen. Operator: Is she lying on the floor, is she? Sienna: Yeah . Operator: Okay, alright Sienna. Alright, you keep talking to me. Are you able to open the door if policemen get there to let them in? Sienna: No . Operator: You are not? Sienna: No . Operator: Okay, is daddy there? Sienna: No, he is at work. Operator: Daddy's at work, alright. Sienna: [inaudible] . Operator: You can't what, sorry sweetheart? Sienna: [inaudible] . Operator: Is mummy talking at all? Sienna: No . Operator: Okay, just bear with me a minute.","Sienna Adderley was watching CBeebies when her mother began shaking .

"The general election is set to be a battle of the generations, with the Tories wooing pensioners while Labour tries to persuade the under-30s to turn out to vote. David Cameron is poised to announce he will protect pensioner benefits including winter fuel cash and TV licences from cuts as part of what has been dubbed a 'Fifty Shades of Grey' strategy. By contrast, Ed Miliband's best hopes of becoming Prime Minister depend on Labour's appear to people in their twenties and thirties, who could swing the result in dozens of seats. The Conservatives are most popular with the over-60s while Labour's appeal is highest among 25-39 year olds . All the main party leaders yesterday took part in a Q&A session with young people on Sky News and Facebook. While Mr Cameron was challenged over cuts to housing benefit for the under-25s, Mr Miliband focussed on promising 'higher skill, higher wage jobs'. The Conservatives are most popular with the over-60s, with 37 per cent saying they will back Mr Cameron, compared to only 22 per cent of 18-24 year olds. By contrast, Labour's appeal is highest among 25-39 year olds at 41 per cent, falling sharply to 27 per cent among the over-60s. The Tories have made clear where their ambitions lie with a series of pro-pensioner policies. They include increasing the state pension by at least 2.5 per cent each year, £10billion in Pensioner Bonds paying higher interest rates and allowing people to withdraw all of the pension funds when they retire. Mr Cameron last week signalled that he will protect benefits for Britain’s wealthiest pensioners, insisting there were not big savings to be made from cutting winter fuel payments, TV licences and bus passes for the well-off. It is seen as the clearest signal yet that the Tories who believe older people hold the key to election victory. Answering questions about benefit cuts for the young yesterday, David Cameron insisted school leavers should not be able to move straight into a life on the dole . Labour leader Ed Miliband sought to woo younger voters with the promise of a young people’s manifesto and votes for 16 and 17-year-olds . Health Minister Norman Lamb has warned Tory cuts could cost lives . Planned Tory spending cuts will have 'very serious consequences' for the old and frail – and could even cost lives, a Lib Dem minister has warned. Health Minister Norman Lamb said Conservative plans to slash the deficit without increasing taxes meant it was 'inevitable' that care for the elderly would be drastically hit. He said old-age care was already facing huge pressures, but Mr Cameron's decision to protect school funding as well as health and overseas aid meant the impact was now going to be 'massive'. This will mean 'unacceptable standards of care' which could cost lives, he said. Mr Lamb told MailOnline: 'Now they've said schools are going to be ring-fenced, the proportionate impact on other areas is going to be even greater. 'I'm quite sure they won't be ring-fencing councils [which control social care spending] against deficit reduction and so the impact on services for frail elderly people could be massive and the knock on effect for the NHS could be significant as well.' He went on: 'If you are going to cut that further, and as far as I can see that's inevitable under the Tories' plans, the consequences for older people are very serious.' Asked if it would put their lives at risk he said: 'Of course, potentially that is the case, but also just unacceptable standards of care. 'If they want to solve that by transferring money from the NHS budget, then it means they are not ring-fencing the NHS.' Labour has said it will stop winter fuel payments to 600,000 pensioners with incomes of more than £42,000. One Tory Cabinet minister said: 'At the end of the day, pensioners are more likely to vote. Labour is sending the signal that they are ready to come after pensioners, which will anger even those with incomes nothing like £42,000. 'Cutting pensioner benefits won't raise a lot of money but will frighten an awful lot of people who we need to support us.' Answering questions about benefit cuts for the young yesterday, Mr Cameron insisted school leavers should not be able to move straight into a life on the dole. The Tory leader said: 'Today as we speak, there is the option as you leave school to go and sign on, to get unemployment benefit and then to get a flat and housing benefit and I just think that is a bad way to start your life. 'It is much better either to go on and do an apprenticeship or go to university or go to college or get a job, those are better options and I don't think that this idea that you can somehow opt out of working life and training, I think it’s a bad approach and we shouldn’t do it.' Meanwhile, Labour has clear its intention to target younger voters. Mr Miliband has launched plans for a young people’s manifesto. Taking part in the Stand Up And Be Counted Q&A event, he said: 'I think it is incredibly important that we have a manifesto that does reflect the wishes of young people. 'We are going to give the vote to 16 and 17 year olds. I think we want to hear the voices of young people more in our politics but you come back to me and say what you think we should be doing that we’re not.' Barely half of 18-24-year-olds voted in the 2010 election, compared to almost three-quarters of the over-65s. In the last 50 years total turnout has fallen from 77 per cent in 1964 to 65 per cent four years ago. In the sixties turnout was highest among 35-54 year olds, but social change and a sense of duty among the post-war generation means that 5 per cent more of of the over-65s voted in 2010 than the next highest age group. Sadiq Khan, Labour's shadow justice secretary, has accused parties of deliberately targeting older because they were more likely to vote. He warned the problem meant more people in their twenties and thirties were becoming disengaged from the political process, believing parties will only govern in the interests of the elderly. 'You look at any empirical analysis of this government's policies and you can see they are going for the silver vote,' he said. Turnout has fallen must steeply among 18-24-year-olds, according to research of elections dating back to 1964 . A study by the Intergenerational Foundation suggests if 2 per cent more people aged 18-34 year olds turned out to vote, they could oust 20 sitting MPs. An increase of 5 per cent would remove 41 MPs and 10 per cent would unseat 83 MPs. Angus Hanton, IF Co-Founder, said it dispels the myth that ‘younger people’s votes hold no power’. ‘Ignoring the interests of younger generations in favour of maintaining support from the grey vote with measures such as the Pensioner Bond, may see politicians punished at the ballot box. ‘Our research suggests that at least 50 MPs should seriously consider their offer to young people.’","37% of over-60s back Tories, compared to only 22% of 18-24 year olds .

"Families struggling to pay crippling heating bills this winter have been told by the energy watchdog to take packed lunches to work to save money. Ofgem has been criticised for offering ‘patronising’ advice, rather than focusing on stopping energy firms from ‘ripping off’ customers. Energy companies have come under fire for not passing on a sharp fall in wholesale prices to customers, while price comparison websites have been accused of hiding cheap energy deals. It comes as a new study suggests energy firms have robbed the average family of £145 over the past year by failing to pass on a sharp fall in wholesale prices. Scroll down for video . Families struggling with crippling heating costs this winter have been told by the energy watchdog Ofgem to eat packed lunches to help pay the bills . Energy have moved to cut their bills in recent weeks after coming under pressure from the government to react to falling global oil prices. But Which? said retail prices have not fallen in line with wholesale costs, cost consumers up to £2.9billion over the last year. This is equivalent of £145 per household on standard energy tariffs. Last week it emerged firms have made almost 50 per cent more profit in a year. Ofgem said the average profit per household was £114 in the past 13 months – up from £77. But Ofgem itself has come under fire for not doing enough to stop customers being ripped off, and instead telling people to find other ways to save money to pay energy bills. While energy bills are still more than £1,300, Ofgem suggested people could saving £735.80 by making packed lunches. In guidance issued by the regulator, drawn up by personal finance expert Jasmine Birtles, states: The average office worker spends £2.83 a day on buying lunch (based on meal deals of a sandwich, drink and snack). Save your money and instead make and take your own food into work.' It also suggests cutting back on buying coffee, and instead take a flask to work. 'Cut back on a morning coffee each day by investing in a reusable flask. Avoiding a £2.60 medium latte each day could help you save £676 across the year,' the guidance said. People are also urged to 'get cheaper mobile phone bills by picking up a basic second-hand handset and then try out a SIM-only deal for a snip of the price'. Labour's shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said: 'This is patronising rubbish. People don't need lecturing on taking a packed lunch to work, jogging round the block or getting a second-hand mobile phone, they need a regulator that will stop energy companies ripping them off. 'Unfortunately, the reason the regulator has no teeth is because the Tories and Lib Dems voted against giving the regulator the power to cut bills. 'They now have nobody else to blame for the failure of the energy companies to pass on the full savings from wholesale cost falls to all consumers. 'The next Labour government is committed to making big changes in our energy market: freezing energy prices until 2017 so that bills can fall but not rise, and giving the regulator the power to force energy companies to cut their prices when wholesale costs fall.' An Ofgem spokesman said: 'The last thing we intended to do back on 7 January 2015 was to give offence through a press release which was trying to get across the point that savings of up to £250 are available to energy customers.' The watchdog said it had referred energy firms to the Competition and Markets Authority for a full investigation. But Which? said energy bills could have been slashed further and sooner than the recent flurry of cuts. The consumer group compared costs to suppliers of buying wholesale energy since 2013 to the prices paid by consumers through energy bills in the same period. It said the research suggests standard variable energy tariffs have not kept in line with wholesale prices over the last two years. Which? claimed it could find 'no justification' to increases in gas and electricity prices in late 2013, based on wholesale costs. It said the recent cuts of up to 5.1 per cent in standard gas tariffs by Big Six suppliers should have been higher. If they were aligned with wholesale energy costs the cuts should have been in the region of 8.8% to 10.3 per cent, equivalent to a decrease of between £777 million and £907 million a year to households on standard gas tariffs, the report claimed. Labour's shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint condemned the 'patronising rubbish' from Ofgem . It also said suppliers could reduce electricity prices by up to 10 per cent. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Our analysis places a massive question mark over how suppliers have been setting prices over the last two years. They now need to explain to their customers why bills don't fall further in response to dropping wholesale prices. 'Energy bills are consistently the top consumer concern so it's about time people got a fair deal. 'While the competition inquiry should establish beyond doubt whether the price people are paying today is right, consumers will now look to politicians of every party to set out how they'll deliver fair and affordable energy prices in the future.' Which? said the research involved looking at commonly used buying or hedging models reflecting the range of approaches 'most likely' to have been used by suppliers to estimate the cost of buying wholesale energy since 2013. Watchdog Ofgem predicts the Big Six will make £114 on the average dual fuel bill over the next year, up dramatically on the the £77 margin in 2014 . Wholesale costs are falling, making it cheaper for energy suppliers to buy gas and electricity before selling it on to families . These costs were analysed against an estimate of what consumers have paid for wholesale costs through energy bills in the same period. Lawrence Slade, chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, said: 'Customer deals are falling in price - over £100 cheaper than this time last year. 'The Which? calculations are based on very many assumptions and do not reflect the cheaper deals we are seeing. 'Which? points out that each company allocates their costs differently and this makes it difficult to estimate wholesale costs and hedging strategies. 'Indeed its hedging assumptions for 2013 are different from Ofgem's report based on the companies' actual accounts. 'Costs are coming down but, because energy companies buy ahead to fix prices and to plan with certainty, the gas and electricity we are using today has already been paid for.' Energy regulator Ofgem said it welcomes Which?'s contribution to the debate on energy prices. A spokesman added: 'We have consistently called for suppliers to explain the growing gap between wholesale prices and retail prices. 'Which?'s report echoes Ofgem's concerns that bills go up faster in response rising wholesale prices than they fall when wholesale prices come down, which was one of the reasons for our referral of the market to the Competition and Markets Authority.'","Watchdog accused of 'patronising rubbish' with money-saving tips .

"Surgery to reconstruct women the clitorises of women who have been circumcised is becoming increasingly common (file photo) Surgery to restore function in women's clitorises is becoming increasingly common to help those who have suffered female genital mutilation. The procedure offers hope women who have had their clitorises circumcised, and who suffer painful side effects and a loss of sexual pleasure as a result . Surgeons carrying out the procedure say the operation could stop  pain, help women feel sexual pleasure and restore their identity and femininity. Worldwide, the UN estimates that over 133 million women have been subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM). While surgeons in the US, France, Canada and various countries in Africa offer the operation, last month a Swedish surgeon successfully reconstructed a clitoris for the first time. The procedure can be performed because the clitoris is much larger than most people assume, Dr Hannes Sigurjónsson, the surgeon who performed the operation, told VICE. ‘The clitoris isn't completely removed during a genital mutilation operation – only the part that is visible,’ Dr Sigurjónsson, of Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Sweden told VICE journalist Rasmus Elfton. ‘So the point of my method is to carefully remove scar tissue and reveal the part of the clitoris that's still there, mobilise it forward and put it in its place.’ The clitoris has a 10cm long root that arches around the vagina, and when FGM is carried out, only the visible part of the clitoris is cut off. This means surgeons are able to remove the scar tissue, pull the remaining parts of clitoris – which also feels sensation - to the front of the vagina to rebuild a working organ. In some cases, the perpetrators have performed a procedure called infibulation, Dr Sigurjónsson said. This is where the clitoris is removed and the labia are stitched together to form a cover over the vagina. A small hole is left for urine, menstruation, childbirth and intercourse. Therefore surgeons must first surgically open the vaginal orifice, Dr Sigurjónsson said. While he cannot ever fully restore the genitalia to how they would have been before the woman was mutilated, plenty of parts in the genital area can be re-created, he said. He continued: ‘We can open the vagina up again and we can recreate the clitoris and the clitoris hood. The clitoris isn't completely removed during a genital mutilation operation – only the part that is visible. It is much longer than most people assume, beyond the visible tip, there is a 10cm long root that arches around the vagina beneath the surface. This means in order to reconstruct the clitoris, surgeons remove the the scar tissue and pull the remaining parts of clitoris to the front of the vagina, stitching it up. As the whole clitoris feels sensation - not just the tip - they are able to rebuild a working organ. ‘We can also in some cases recreate the labia minora (the inner ‘lips’ of the vagina).’ ‘The method is being developed and is getting better with time, research and experience. ‘But it will always be hard to restore someone's mutilated genitals 100 per cent.’ He added that clitoral reconstruction is not just about the physical repair of the genitalia, the psychological aspect is just as vital. He said: ‘The most important thing when treating women and girls who have been victims of female genital mutilation is for plastic surgeons, gynaecologists, sexologists and psychotherapists to work together. ‘It is only with a multidisciplinary approach that these women can see improvement in their quality of life and experience less pain.’ Dr Marci Bowes, a U.S. surgeon who has carried out hundreds of procedures since 2009, said the number one reason women undergo the operation is to restore their identity. ‘Women who have been cut feel their sense of womanhood has been stolen from them and they want that back,’ she told Washington Post journalists. ‘They want their body back and to feel more normal. It’s about not being different any more.’ The most common side effects of the procedure, according to the available research, are bleeding and infections, which affect around three to five per cent of women. Most of the women who undergo the procedure experience less pain and more sensation in their reconstructed clitoris after the surgery. Surgeons say the surgery can prevent pain, restore sexual function and the identity of women who have been subjected to female genital mutilation . But a minority, less than five per cent, feel less sensation afterwards – a risk Dr Sigurjónsson said he makes clear to all patients. The technique to restore function in the clitoris was developed only a decade ago, pioneered by French urologist and surgeon Pierre Foldès. Reconstructive surgery to repair the physical damage of FGM is not a new phenomenon, but the procedure is becoming more common as more women become aware of it. The market for this surgery is less niche than one might assume, Dr Sigurjónsson said. The Swedish Board of Health and Welfare estimates that 19,000 women in Sweden are in the risk zone of getting mutilated. Dr Sigurjónsson said: ‘Worldwide, reliable sources such as the United Nations and Unicef report that over 133 million women have been subjects to female genital mutilation. ‘Three million young girls are mutilated every year. So the demand for this kind of surgery is huge.’","Operations to restore clitoral function are becoming increasingly common .

"Rihanna has successfully won her bid for Topshop to pay her legal costs of £1.5million after the fashion chain used her image on a T-shirt (pictured) Topshop has been ordered to pay Rihanna's 'startling' £1.5million legal bill in a further blow to the fashion chain after she won a ban on using her picture on its T-shirts. The 26-year-old singer sued Topshop's parent company Arcadia for £3.3million after the sleeveless 'tank-top', which featured a photo taken during a video shoot, appeared in stores in 2011. She was awarded the payout following a two-year legal battle last month and today at the Appeal Court successfully defeated a bid to pay her own estimated £919,000 legal costs from the trial. Lawyers for Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group argued that there was 'no proper basis' for forcing them to pay up the bill along with their own costs. Last month they lost their appeal and were faced with an increased legal bill from the pop star, estimated at £1.5million - as well as their own estimated £500,000 bill. But, today, appeal judges Lord Justice Richards, Lord Justice Kitchin and Lord Justice Underhill ruled the costs order was 'reasonable' and dismissed the challenge. The legal battle was over a T-shirt featuring a photo taken during a video shoot for Rihanna's hit We Found Love in 2011. Her legal team successfully argued her fans, who saw her as a fashion icon, would have falsely thought she had endorsed the garment sold by the high-street fashion store. In July 2013, High Court judge Mr. Justice Birss found the store guilty of unlawfully passing off her image, and ordered them to pay her legal costs, even though he found the size of her bill 'startling' and 'somewhat surprising.' But Arcadia, whose own legal costs for the trial amounted to just £350,000, had asked the three appeal judges at a hearing last year to overturn the orders. Their counsel, Geoffrey Hobbs QC,said the judge had erred in law. But Lord Justice Kitchin said today that after careful consideration 'we are unable to accept that the judge fell into error.' Lawyers for Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group, which owns Topshop, argued that there was 'no proper basis' for forcing them to pay up the bill along with their own costs but appeal judges dismissed the challenge . He added: 'It follows that the appeal on costs must be dismissed.' Rihanna, who was described as a 'style icon' by the trial judge, had claimed an estimated £3.5million in damages for the wrongful use of her photograph, described as 'unflattering'. However an inquiry as to damages and profits made by Topshop have yet to be heard. She also sought the return of any unsold T-shirts, but the court heard all 12,000 which started at £22 but reduced to £5 each, had been sold, and only five were left and kept for the legal action. Old friends: Rihanna with good friend and Topshop owner Sir Philip Green . They were hung on clothes rails in court as Mr. Hobbs told the judges the T-shirts were like a canvas carrying words and images. Lord Justice Kitchin said last month that Rihanna had an enormous reputation and goodwill and people might have bought the T-shirt thinking she had an association with it. He said if Roger Federer's picture was on a tennis racket or Rory McIlroy's photo on a golf club people would think they endorsed it. In his judgment, unanimously backed by the other two judges he dismissed Topshop's appeal. He said there could be a 'false belief' by customers that the 'world famous pop star' had endorsed the T-shirt's bearing her image. The court found that 'a substantial number of purchasers are likely to be deceived into buying the T-shirt because of false belief that it has been authorised by Rihanna herself.' Because of her current tie up with high street rivals River Island it was found that the Topshop T-shirt would be damaging to the style icon's goodwill and a loss to her merchandising business. 'It also represents a loss of control over her reputation in the fashion sphere,' ruled Mr. Justice Birss. The Barbadian star, who lives in America sued the Arcadia Group in her full name of Robyn Rihanna Fenty and did no appear in court. The judge said the multi-millionaire has sold over 30 million albums and 120 million singles, and won over 200 awards including five prestigious Grammy awards. The Appeal Judges agreed that it was 'right and fair' to grant her a permanent injunction after being told that Topshop had failed to promise not to use her image on T-shirts in the future. Chat: Rihanna had been close to the family which owns Topshop, including Philip's daughter Chloe (pictured together in Barbados over Christmas 2011) before the row about the image was used on a T-shirt .","Pop star Rihanna sued Topshop after it used her photograph on a T-shirt .

"A 21-year-old Missouri father has been charged with felony child abuse after his baby son died from a traumatic brain injury last month. Cody Bunch of Festus told police three-month-old  Aiden was injured when he fell over while carrying him. Aiden was hurt on January 6 and the infant died at St. Louis Children's Hospital after he was taken off life support four days later. After doctor's discovered evidence of seven prior injuries, Bunch was charged on January 16 with 'child abuse resulting in death' and he is being held in the Jefferson County Jail on a $500,000, cash-only bond. If found guilty of the Class A felony, which is equivalent to a manslaughter or murder charge, Bunch faces a minimum sentence of ten years and a maximum of life behind bars. Scroll down for video . Aiden Bunch (pictured) died on January 10 after he was taken off life support at St. Louis Children's Hospital . Cody Bunch of Festus, Missouri, was charged with child abuse resulting in death after his three-month-old son Aiden died last month. He is being held at Jefferson County Jail . Bunch (left) and Aiden’s mother, Brooke Besch (right), welcomed their son into the world on October 6 . The infant was born on October 6. His memorial service was held on January 14 in Missouri . Police arrived at the family's apartment around 2.15 am after Aiden’s mother, Brooke Besch, called 911 and reported the boy was not breathing. When they arrived, Bunch told them he had fallen down while he was holding the boy, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. An autopsy revealed the boy had seven contusions inside his scalp, swollen neck ligaments and a subdural hematoma. A doctor found the injuries were caused by 'abusive head trauma' and not from a fall. Lieutenant Sgt. Jim Kausler of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department said: 'Through the course of the investigation we determined that there was some head trauma. 'We questioned the last people to have custody, the mother and father. 'There was more than one injury that he [Bunch] wasn't telling us about.' Neighbors in Bunch's apartment complex said he was unemployed after recently losing his job, KTVI reported. A family member called the situation a 'nightmare'. Bunch sent this message to a Missouri community page the day after his son's memorial service . An autopsy found the boy had seven contusions inside his scalp and had suffered 'abusive head trauma' In a Facebook post he sent to community page Jeffo 411 on January 15, the day after Aiden's memorial service, Bunch wrote: 'Hi, I'm Cody.

"It has long been known that flying in formation saves birds precious energy, which they need for long migrations. Now, a study claims that migrating birds 'share the pain' of leading a v-formation so that all members of the flock can take turns saving energy by following in another avian’s wake. The new research is the first convincing evidence for 'turn taking' reciprocal cooperative behaviour in birds. Ibis take turns saving energy by following in another bird's wake (pictured), according to a new study. It is thought to be the first example of 'turn taking' reciprocal cooperative behaviour in birds . It is also only the second good example of reciprocal cooperation in animals, following a study that revealed how vampire bats shared blood to keep other unrelated individuals alive. An international team of experts led by Oxford University studied 14 juvenile Northern bald ibis (Geronticus eremita) migrating from Salzburg in Austria to Orbetello in Italy. The birds followed a powered parachute carrying their handlers and each wore small data loggers, enabling the researchers to examine how individuals within a flying v-formation interacted. The researchers found that individual birds changed position frequently within the flock, flying in formations of between two and 12 birds. Individuals spent almost a third of their time flying in the updraft produced by another bird's flapping wings – letting them save energy - and a similar amount of time leading a formation, according to the study published in the journal PNAS. The researchers found that individual birds (stock image) changed position frequently within the flock, flying in formations of between two and 12 birds . Illustrating how risky migrations are for birds, a previous study has shown that up to 35 per cent of juvenile birds can die of exhaustion on their first migration. Flying in formation helps them save vital energy. For example, geese are thought to make energy savings of 10 to14 per cent by gaining lift from flying in the updraft of other birds. The scientists investigated why 'selfish' individuals would 'altruistically' use up more of their energy leading a formation, as well as how flocks guard against 'free-loaders' that never take the lead, preferring instead to save energy by following. Flying in formation helps migrating birds save vital energy. For example, geese are thought to make energy savings of 10 to14 per cent by gaining lift from flying in the updraft of other birds. Ibis birds work in pairs with one bird leading and a 'wingman' benefiting by following in the leader's updraft. The birds take turns and by travelling in pairs, save energy, while those flying in large flocks may expend even less energy. The birds check they are taking turns fairly to stop any freeloaders hitching a free ride in a v-formation, without leading. Lead author Dr Bernhard Voelkl said: 'We think that it is the extreme risks associated with long migration journeys that have driven the evolution of such cooperative behaviour where something like saving 10 per cent of your energy can make the difference between life and death.' Lead author Dr Bernhard Voelkl of Oxford University's Department of Zoology, explained: 'Our study shows that the “building blocks” of reciprocal cooperative behaviour can be very simple: ibis often travel in pairs, with one bird leading and a 'wingman' benefiting by following in the leader's updraft. ‘We found that in these pairs individuals take turns, precisely matching the amount of time they spend in the energy-sapping lead position and the energy-saving following position.' By travelling in a pair, the energy costs for both individuals are reduced and larger formations bring even greater energy savings. 'We found that larger formations of ibis were still made up of these “turn-taking” pairs,’ Dr Voelkl said. 'The checking that went on within these pairs was sufficient on its own to prevent any freeloaders hitching a free ride within a v-formation without leading. ‘In fact, surprisingly, we found no evidence of “cheating” of any kind within these flocks with the level of cooperation, with individuals benefiting from following 32 per cent of the time, significantly higher than expected. 'We think that it is the extreme risks associated with long migration journeys that have driven the evolution of such cooperative behaviour where something like saving 10 per cent of your energy can make the difference between life and death.' Experts are planning on studying how the cooperative behaviour of the juvenile ibis develops over time and whether they learn to fine-tune their energy-saving tactics. The team also say more research is needed to quantify the energy-saving benefits for individuals by fitting the birds with sensors to monitor heart rate and respiration, for example. Migrating birds precisely time the flapping of their wings and adjust their position to make the best of the subtle effects of air turbulence, researchers discovered last January. In this way, each bird takes advantage of 'upwash' thrown up by the wings of the flyer in front while avoiding lift-sapping 'downwash'. Scientists learned the aviation secrets of migrating birds after attaching tiny logging devices to a flock of 14 northern bald ibises that not only tracked their position and speed by satellite but measured every flap of their wings. The birds were studied as they flew alongside a microlight on their migration route from Austria to their winter home in Tuscany, Italy. Lead researcher Dr Steve Portugal, from the Royal Veterinary College, University of London, said: 'The intricate mechanisms involved in V-formation flight indicate remarkable awareness and ability of birds to respond to the wingpath of nearby flock-mates. 'Birds in v-formation seem to have developed complex phasing strategies to cope with the dynamic wakes produced by flapping wings.' When flying in a v-formation, the birds’ wing flaps were approximately 'in-phase', meaning all the wing tips followed roughly the same path, the scientists found. This helped each bird capture extra lift from the upwash of its neighbour in front. Occasional shifts of position within the formation meant that at times birds flew directly one behind the other. When this happened, the birds altered their wing beats to an out-of-phase pattern to avoid being caught by downwash.","Oxford University study claims birds take turns in leading a v-formation .

"Thousands of Jordanians have marched through the capital of Amman calling for the immediate execution of six Islamic State prisoners following the horrendous death of captured Jordanian pilot, Muath al-Kasasbeh. Gunfire and rioting has also reportedly been witnessed in the Jordanian town of Karak, the hometown of Mr Kasasbeh. Roads have been blocked with makeshift barricades and thick smoke has been seen after locals started to burn tyres. At least one government building has been torched. Disgusted protesters took to the streets just hours after the release of a sickening 22-minute-long ISIS video that shows Mr al-Kasabeh being burned alive while he was locked helpless in a cage. The release of the expertly-edited video - which represents a new level of barbarity from a group notorious for its savagery - has prompted Jordan to announce it would execute all six prisoners convicted of association with ISIS at dawn today, roughly 6.40am (4.40am GMT). Scroll down for videos . Hundreds of angry Jordanians have marched through the capital of Amman calling for the immediate death of six Islamic State prisoners . Activists took to the streets  to protest and wave their flags in defiance of the shocking video showing the death of a Jordanian pilot . Demonstrators carried signs that read: 'We demand the execution of Islamic State detainees in Jordan' as they marched through Amman . The chilling footage, entitled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', appears to show the captured airman being set alight as the militants, infamous for their barbaric murders, plunged to new depths of depravity. The footage, filmed from several camera angles, shows the pilot wearing an orange jumpsuit and seemingly doused in fuel, as a trail of petrol leading up to the iron bars of the cage is seen being set ablaze. Flames are seen quickly spreading across the dirt to the cage where they completely engulf the helpless pilot in images that are far too distressing to publish. Within an hour of the 22-minute-long video's publication, Jordan reportedly moved six ISIS-linked prisoners to a jail in the south of the country which is usually used for state executions. Furious demonstrators were tonight been chanting ‘we want to execute al-Rishawi’ as they marched with Jordanian flags, pictured . One activist holds a sign that reads: 'We demand to ban terrorist ideology' as he protests the death of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh . The Jordanian government had said they will only release failed female suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi (right), who is on death row in Jordan, if it received proof Mr Kasasbeh (left) is alive. There are now reports she will be executed tomorrow morning . It is understood the execution of Sajida al-Rishawi - the female militant whom ISIS had originally demanded Jordan release in exchange for Kasasbeh - will take place tomorrow morning. Furious demonstrators were tonight chanting ‘we want to execute al-Rishawi’ as they marched. She is one of six prisoners who have reportedly already been transferred to Sawaqa prison in southern Jordan, where they are expected to spend their final night. Sajida al-Rishawi: The would-be suicide bomber was condemned to death for her participation in deadly attacks in Amman in 2005. ISIS had offered to spare the life of the Jordanian fighter pilot, Lieutenant Maaz al-Kassasbeh, if she were released. She will reportedly be the first prisoner executed. Ziad al-Karbouli: The Iraqi Al-Qaeda operative, also known as Abu Houthiyafah, was sentenced to death for being behind a spate of attacks on Jordanian trucks driving in Iraq in 2007. It is understood he could be killed. Saad al-Noaimi: An Iraqi national, al-Noaimi was found guilty of being involved in a failed plot to detonate 8.8 pounds of explosives at a luxury hotel in Amman in 2006. Muammar al-Jaghbir: There are reports Al-Jaghbir, who was sentenced to death for murdering US diplomat Laurence Foley in 2002, could also be executed. He was previously charged for plotting to bomb the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad. Al-Rishawi is expected to be hanged tomorrow along with five other IS affiliated prisoners. King Abdullah cut short a visit to the US, before making a statement on Jordanian TV, saying he had received news of the 'martyrdom with sadness and deep sorrow'. Calling the murder a 'cowardly act of terror', he also pleaded for his countrymen to stand 'side-by-side', vowing that Kasasbeh's death 'would only make us stronger'. US President Barack Obama says that if the video turns out to be authentic, it would be more evidence of the group's 'viciousness and barbarity.' He added that the U.S. would 'redouble the vigilance and determination on the part of our global coalition to make sure they are degraded and ultimately defeated,' adding that the footage serves to indicate that 'whatever ideology they are operating out of is bankrupt.' Prime Minister David Cameron also condemned the 'sickening murder', but said it would only 'strengthen our resolve'. He said: 'I pay tribute to the dedication and bravery of Lieutenant Moaz al-Kassasbeh, who paid with his life while protecting his country and us all. My thoughts and prayers are with his family tonight at this tragic time. 'These terrorists' brutal behaviour will only strengthen our resolve... We will not stop until these evil extremists and their poisonous ideology are defeated.' Following the king’s speech, a photo montage of the Jordanian pilot was shown, accompanied by a melancholic soundtrack of classical music. Tomorrow, would-be suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi will be executed along with five other jihadists, an official told Afp. 'The sentence of death pending on... Iraqi Sajida al-Rishawi will be carried out at dawn,"" the security official said on Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. Rishawi, the would-be bomber, was condemned to death for her participation in deadly attacks in Amman in 2005, and IS had offered to spare the life of the Jordanian fighter pilot, Lieutenant Maaz al-Kassasbeh, if she were released. 'The death sentence will be carried out on a group of jihadists, starting with Rishawi, as well as Iraqi Al-Qaeda operative Ziad Karbuli and others who attacked Jordan's interests,' the security source said. 'Jordan's response will be earth-shattering,"" Information Minister Mohammed Momani said earlier on television, while the army and government vowed to avenge the pilot's murder. Mr Kasasbeh's relatives joined protesters on the streets of Amman tonight to express their disgust at the pilot's brutal death . Supporters met outside a tribal gathering chamber on Tuesday night, where a large image of Mr Kasasbeh (right) had been displayed . Above, Enraged protesters in Amman. Gunfire and rioting has also reportedly been witnessed in the Jordanian town of Karak . 'Whoever doubted the unity of the Jordanian people, we will prove them wrong,' said Momani, who is also government spokesman. 'The pilot did not belong to a specific tribe or come from a specific governorate, he was the son of all Jordanians, who stand united,' he said. Among the other prisoners who are thought to be facing execution tomorrow is Ziad al-Karbouli, who was sentenced to death for being behind a spate of attacks on Jordanian trucks driving in Iraq in 2007. Also known as Abu Houthiyafah, al-Karbouli was a considered a leading figure under the command of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the deceased former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq. Another prisoner is thought to be jailed Iraqi national Saad al-Noaimi. al-Noaimi was found guilty of being involved in a failed plot to detonate 8.8 pounds of explosives at a luxury hotel in Amman in 2006. The footage appears to show the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is seen being set alight (right). It begins by showing Kasasbeh being paraded in front of heavily armed men wearing combat fatigues and yellow masks (left) Likewise, another close associate of al-Zarqawi, Muammar al-Jaghbir, could also be executed. Al-Jaghbir was sentenced to death for murdering Laurence Foley, a US diplomat in 2002. Al-Jaghbir, 44, was previously charged along with al-Zarqawi for plotting to bomb the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is also thought to be considering the idea of executing several Islamic State prisoners in retaliation for al-Kasasbeh’s death. The sickening video has even been criticised by Al Qaeda with Al Qaeda in Arabian Pennisula (AQAP) declaring that the brutality of the execution proves why Al Qaeda and Islamic State do not share the same ideology. In a short statement, an AQAP affiliated social media account wrote that the burning to death of Moath al-Kasabeh was ‘conclusive prove’ of the ‘deviation’ from Islam by Islamic State.","ISIS video released yesterday shows Jordanian pilot Muatah al-Kasabeh being burnt alive while locked in a cage .

"First came the 36 questions that could make you fall for anyone. Now a new study has revealed that there are just two questions that married couples can ask on another to make sure they are definitely in love. Using data from a survey originally conducted in the 1980s, University of Virginia economists Leora Friedberg and Steven Stern analysed the answers of 4,242 couples who were asked two simple questions. Scroll down for video . Can you really fall in love with someone after 36 questions? In 1997, a New York  Arthur Aron made strangers fall in love using a simple experiment deigned to create closeness between two strangers . The first is: How happy are you in your marriage relative to how happy you would be if you weren't in the marriage? And the second: How do you think your spouse answered that question? The questioned couples were asked to rate their answers on a scale of, 'much worse,' to, 'much better.' The couples were then asked the same questions six years later to see how their answers had changed over time. Friedberg and Stern found that the couples who said they would be no worse off if they were single had generally broken up by the time they were questioned for the second time. They also found that those who over-estimated their partners happiness also were also more likely to end up divorced. Stern used his own marriage as an example: 'If I believe my wife is really happy in the marriage, I might push her to do more chores or contribute a larger portion of the family income. 'If, unbeknownst to me, she's actually just lukewarm about the marriage, or she's got a really good-looking guy who is interested in her, she may decide those demands are the last straw, and decide a divorce would be a better option for her.' The data from the 1980s reveals two significant questions couple's can ask their partners . This new research follows on the footsteps of a recently revisited 20-year-old study which says that you can use 36 questions to fall in love with anyone. A New York Times journalist took psychologist Arthur Aron's 1997 test to see if closeness could be created in an experimental environment. The quiz progresses from relaxed questions like, 'Would you like to be famous? In what way?' to more intimate ones such as, 'What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?'. For his study, Aron paired up a couple of strangers - a heterosexual man and woman - and gave them 45 minutes to answer the list of 36 questions, which gradually grew more intimate. Then, the couple had to stare into each other's eyes for four minutes in total silence. In the end, the two  participants who had walked into his laboratory through separate doors as total strangers fell in love. Six months later they got married - and invited the entire lab to the ceremony. And 20 years on, Mandy Len Catron, author of the popular Modern Love column in The New York Times, tried out the experiment and is now in a relationship with the man who took the test with her. Here, FEMAIL reveal the 36 questions said to make anyone fall in love with you.

"In a turbulent 24 hours, the Northern Territory is right back where it started, after it appeared to lose a chief minister, gain a new one, and then eventually reinstated the first one. And despite expressing a desire to avoid the fate of the LNP in Queensland, the damage wrought may well consign the Country Liberals to a one-term government when the public go to the polls in August next year. At 1am on Tuesday, Minister for Primary Industry and Mines Willem Westra van Holthe called a hasty news conference to announce that he had been voted chief minister by his parliamentary wing colleagues. Mr Westra van Holthe said Mr Giles had '110 per cent' of his support, and that he was very pleased to be deputy . The trigger was discontent with the direction the government was taking, he said, promising to be more consultative and transparent. But just 18 hours later he stood calmly beside the man he'd tried to topple and pledged him his full support, dismissing the incident as ""nothing more than a fairly large blip on the radar"". 'I am 100 per cent, in fact 110 per cent behind the chief minister,' Mr Westra van Holthe told reporters. Earlier in the day Chief Minister Adam Giles refused to resign just minutes before Mr Westra van Holthe's planned swearing-in ceremony at 11am, grinding the leadership change to a halt. As it turned out, the challengers only had the support of nine of the 25 members of the Legislative Assembly, but needed 13 to agree to install a new chief minister. On Tuesday afternoon Mr Giles whittled away their numbers, calling his colleagues' bluff, and pointing out that they couldn't expect to govern if they couldn't mount a proper coup. Mr Giles accepted that mistakes he'd made as leader contributed to the uproar, but was vague on how he would work to his colleagues' satisfaction in future. 'I think you need to be a bit more inclusive in how you do things ... making sure it's not just cabinet deciding things, but also the wider parliamentary wing,' he said. Mr Giles stepped away from suggestions he made earlier in the day that he would consider resigning and calling for an early election, and denied he had threatened his colleagues with a snap poll to retain power. 'I was thinking about an early election to tidy a few things up, but we've resolved our differences ... Willem has been a bloody good minister the whole time in government.' This was a marked difference from his critique of Mr Westra van Holthe earlier in the day, when he said he could have better handled outbreaks of banana freckle and a melon virus. 'Quite frankly, I don't believe that Willem Westra Van Holthe has the capacity, capability or the tenacity or the professionalism to be chief minister,' he said. Meanwhile Mr Westra van Holthe said Mr Giles had '110 per cent' of his support, and that he was very pleased to be deputy. It's his second time in the job, after a six-day stint in 2013 the week before Mr Giles mounted his own successful coup against then-leader Terry Mills, who was in Japan on trade talks. He said he could absolutely rule out staging another coup to get the chief minister's attention in future. Mr Giles said Attorney-General John Elferink, whom Mr Westra van Holthe had named as his deputy, would keep his job, but did not rule out other sackings. The reshuffled cabinet is expected to be sworn in at a later date.","Willem Westra van Holthe announced at 1am on Tuesday he had been voted in an the Northern Territory's new chief minister .

"A primary school governor has been given a restraining order banning her from contacting the school's headmistress for the next four years. Ingrid Chenoweth had been accused of assaulting Karen Middlemore after the teacher tried to stop her son taking part in sports day at St Mawes Community Primary School in Cornwall. She was cleared of attacking the headmistress, but cannot speak to her until 2019 - apart from during meetings of the school governors. Ban: Ingrid Chenoweth, pictured left outside Truro Magistrates' Court, can no longer contact headteacher Karen Middlemore, right, after a restraining order was imposed on her . Mrs Chenoweth, 49, was charged with assault after an altercation with Mrs Middlemore at the school event last June. Witnesses said that the row began when the governor's 10-year-old son was told he would not be able to participate because he had injured his hand - even though his mother insisted he had recovered from the accident. The argument grew so fierce that the school later sent round a letter of apology to all parents, but those present said they did not see any signs of physical violence. One mother said: 'It started when Ingrid's oldest son hurt his wrist playing football. He was checked out but the consultant said he was fine to run. 'It came to sports day and the teachers said he was not allowed to run. Ingrid arrived at the sports day and walked across the track with her son. That is when the argument kicked off. 'The headteacher said it was NHS rules. Ingrid said she had a consultant's report. It was just a huge row that last about 10 minutes. I did not see any physical assault - she wasn't even close to her. School: Mrs Chenoweth is a governor of St Mawes Community Primary School, where Mrs Middlemore works . 'Everyone could hear this conversation. The worst thing about it was that sports still took place, the children were sat waiting to go to their races. 'The whole thing was a complete nonsense. Ingrid has absolutely been put through the mire. All the parents couldn't believe what had happened. 'There has just been confusion. Nobody is allowed to know anything and we haven't really been allowed to talk openly about it.' A father of a child at the school added: 'Everyone has been talking about what happened at the sports day. It was quite shocking really and they caused a real scene.' Speaking after she was cleared of the assault, Mrs Chenoweth - who has two children at the school - said: 'I am very relieved to be exonerated today. I have been through hell for eight months. 'I have always maintained that there was no physical contact between Karen Middlemore and myself and I was not guilty of the offence of common assault. 'My husband David and I are very grateful for the support of many of the parents of children at the school. Row: The two women had an altercation at the St Mawes school, pictured, on sports day in June last year . 'We appreciate their willingness to attend court and give evidence about the incident at sports day on 25 June last year. 'We look forward to participating in the mediation process proposed by the county council and address the communication issues which underpin this incident.' She added: 'Our focus remains our children and putting their interests first. We will continue to do everything to ensure they thrive at St Mawes Primary School. 'I am very relieved we have got justice. I have accepted the restraining order as I am never planning on going near her again. I have turned that around and view it as a way of protecting me from her.' The restraining order prevents Mrs Chenoweth from contacting Mrs Middlemore 'directly save when participating in any mediation process arranged by the local authority or when attending a meeting of the board of governors'. Cornwall Council, speaking on behalf of the school, said that it hoped the hearing would bring an end to the dispute between the two women. A spokesman said: 'It has been a very difficult time for the school, and staff and governors have acted with great professionalism in dealing with this matter.'","Ingrid Chenoweth, 49, had an argument with Karen Middlemore last year .

She tweeted: 'Warms my heart that in Jak's final hours he said ""All I can see is Hannah and it's making me happy""' Shortly after his death, she wrote: 'Thank you for all the beautiful memories never to be forgotten, sweet dreams my boy' More than £50,000 has now been donated to Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research through the Jak's Journey JustGiving page. His mother, Allison Barr, told today of Jak's final wishes for a centre called Jak's Den for local children and ill youngsters to be opened in his memory. She wrote: 'My precious boy always put others first and we want to ensure Jak's Den is a place where people come and feel welcome and at home and for a little while feel special courtesy of my beautiful boy.' Jak wanted the centre to include counselling rooms, a sports area, a cafe and music room. Jak's final wish was to accompany Hannah, who he has been dating for almost two years, to the school event . Jak was diagnosed with T-Cell Lymphoma last year and was told last month that the disease had spread .

The 15-year-old keen footballer was applauded by tearful classmates at the school dance which was organised at the last minute after doctors told him he was dying last week. The teenager's condition had deteriorated rapidly  and he needed pain relief to be able to attend his prom. He could only stay for 10 minutes at the dance which was held at Livingston Football Club near his home in Mid Calder as he started to feel unwell. After the event he wrote a message saying: 'I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again. 'I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving. 'Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along, even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile.'

"A woman who was married for only 46 days before her husband was slain by their wedding guest says his minimum 20 year jail term is not long enough. Phi Ngoc Phu Le, 27, pleaded guilty to murdering Amin Asrawe, who sustained 24 wounds inflicted with a machete and filleting knife when he was ambushed outside his Adelaide home in the early hours of August 9, 2013. Widow Dounia Asrawe told the Supreme Court she was asleep inside when her husband was slaughtered and hated herself for not hearing his screams as she may have been able to save him. Scroll down for video . Allen Amin Asrawe who died after being attacked with a machete in the front yard of his home in 2013 . Asrawe  sustained 24 wounds inflicted with a machete and filleting knife . Justice Kevin Nicholson on Tuesday sentenced Le to life, with a non-parole period of 20 years giving him a discount of six years for his early guilty plea. Outside court, Ms Asrawe said murderers should not get sentencing discounts. 'It's still confusing to me that this man who stood at our wedding was then charged with killing my husband,' she said. Describing the murder as brutal, callous and senseless, the judge said Le had owed Mr Asrawe, a money lender, $30,000.

Le's lawyer submitted that her client was in fear for his life from other people after incurring more debts over drugs. The judge found Le went to the house to confront Mr Asrawe for some purpose, perhaps robbery. He waited for him to return home, forcing twigs into his front door lock so his victim could not escape inside. The judge rejected the crown contention that the crime was pre-meditated, finding he formed the intention to murder during the confrontation. Ms Asrawe told the court she was a wife for only 46 days, saying Le had been at their wedding and visited them at their home . Le had never been in trouble before, which made the case even more perplexing, the judge said. Noting the heartfelt victim impact statements, he said Mr Asrawe was plainly a much-loved and valued member of his family.

"Health Minister Norman Lamb has warned Tory cuts could cost lives . Planned Tory spending cuts will have 'very serious consequences' for the old and frail – and could even cost lives, a Lib Dem minister has warned. Health Minister Norman Lamb said Conservative plans to slash the deficit without increasing taxes meant it was 'inevitable' that care for the elderly would be drastically hit. He said old-age care was already facing huge pressures, but Mr Cameron's decision to protect school funding as well as health and overseas aid meant the impact was now going to be 'massive'. This will mean 'unacceptable standards of care' which could cost lives, he said. Mr Lamb told MailOnline: 'Now they've said schools are going to be ring-fenced, the proportionate impact on other areas is going to be even greater. 'I'm quite sure they won't be ring-fencing councils [which control social care spending] against deficit reduction and so the impact on services for frail elderly people could be massive and the knock on effect for the NHS could be significant as well.' He went on: 'If you are going to cut that further, and as far as I can see that's inevitable under the Tories' plans, the consequences for older people are very serious.' Asked if it would put their lives at risk he said: 'Of course, potentially that is the case, but also just unacceptable standards of care. 'If they want to solve that by transferring money from the NHS budget, then it means they are not ring-fencing the NHS.' Mr Lamb added: 'That's why I have made this call, where I'm saying all of us, all parties should come together for a non-partisan review this year, which would engage the public in a debate on both the care and health budgets.' The Lib Dem minister said he wanted the party's manifesto to include a commitment to transfer the old-age care budget from the department for local government to a new 'Department for Health and Care'. George Osborne last year set out plans for another £55billion of spending cuts in a bid to eliminate the deficit and run up a £23billion budget surplus in 2019/20. Independent economic experts said Government departments like the Home Office, which controls the police, and the Department for Local Government, which overseas old-age care, will have slashed if Mr Osborne is to hit his target. David Cameron yesterday pledged to freeze spending on education per pupil in England in the next Parliament . Welfare cuts or tax rises worth about £21 billion a year would be needed by 2019/20 - at a time when Conservatives are committed to income tax cuts worth £7 billion. Mr Lamb's warning comes amid growing pressures on the NHS – amid an unprecedented squeeze on its finances and increasing demand for treatment at A&E. NHS boss Simon Stevens has called for another £8billion a year to be funnelled into the health budget by 2020.","EXCLUSIVE:  Norman Lamb slams Conservative plans to slash the deficit .

"Death Row Records founder Suge Knight was rushed to the hospital with a panic attack minutes after pleading not guilty to murdering his friend and attempting to kill another man in a hit-and-run. Wearing a Los Angeles County orange inmate jumpsuit, Knight, 49, stood in a defendant's box next to his attorneys and intently read the complaint against him at the hearing in a high security courtroom in Compton, California. Knight has been held at the Los Angeles Men’s Central Jail since Friday, when he surrendered to authorities at the West Hollywood Sheriff’s Station. Scroll down for video . Death Row Records founder Suge Knight (pictured on Tuesday) was rushed to the hospital with a panic attack minutes after pleading not guilty to murdering his friend and attempting to kill another man in a hit-and-run . The former rap music mogul is accused of intentionally running down two men, including a friend, in Compton on Thursday after an argument on a movie set . The 49-year-old has been held at the Los Angeles Men’s Central Jail since Friday, when he surrendered to authorities at the West Hollywood Sheriff’s Station . Knight leaves the courtroom after his arraignment - he was taken to hospital shortly after suffering chest pains . The 49-year-old, who glanced back into the gallery several times, was taken to hospital after suffering a panic attack, reports TMZ. Law enforcement sources said he was in the lockup area next to the courtroom when he began experiencing chest pains and he was taken to hospital via an ambulance. The former rap music mogul pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and other charges filed. He is accused of intentionally running down two men, including a friend, in Compton on Thursday after an argument on a movie set. However, his attorney James Blatt has said the collision was an accident that occurred as Knight was trying to flee an altercation in which he was assaulted. On Monday, prosecutors charged Knight with killing 55-year-old Terry Carter and attempting to kill 51-year-old Cle 'Bone' Sloan. Knight also faces two charges of hit-and-run. Terry Carter, 55, left, died in the accident while Cle 'Bone' Sloan, right, was injured . The owner of Tam's Burgers in Compton, California says CCTV wasn't working the night Knight allegedly killed a man. Above, an LAPD photographer checks the scene of the incident . In addition, Knight's $2 million bail was revoked after a court commissioner agreed with authorities that he was a potential flight risk and could intimidate witnesses. The ruling came after homicide detectives told the bail commissioner that Knight could face a lengthy prison sentence because of a violent criminal past, said Los Angeles County sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida. Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case when the men were hit. Knight was at the center of one of the most notorious rap conflicts of the 1990s, pitting Tupac Shakur against Biggie Smalls in an East Coast-West Coast rivalry. Knight was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with Shakur at a Las Vegas hotel, just hours before Shakur was fatally shot while riding in Knight's car just east of the Strip in 1996. In the current case, Knight struck two men with his pickup in a Compton burger stand parking lot. The collision killed his friend Carter, a founder and owner of Heavyweight Records who was viewed as a local father figure and tried to help mentor young men in the community, said Doug Young, a friend and hip-hop music promoter. Also injured in the collision was Sloan, an actor and film consultant. Knight is the founder of Death Row Records, which worked with Tupac Shakur (Knight and the rapper pictured above in August 19996 file photo) in the last months of his life . Authorities said Knight visited the set for Straight Outta Compton, a film about the rise of the rap group N.W.A., and argued with Sloan, who was working at the location on Thursday. Sheriff's deputies providing security asked Knight to leave. A short time afterward, the argument resumed in a parking lot a few miles away where Knight and Sloan exchanged punches through a window of the pickup before the two men were run down, authorities said. Blatt has said Knight was attacked by four people, including Sloan, as he pulled into the parking lot after Carter requested he show up for a meeting. Blatt said Knight hit the gas and fled in fear. At Tuesday's arraignment, the initial judge assigned recused himself because he had represented both victims in the case in his years as an attorney. Judge Ricardo Ocampo took over the case. The District Attorney’s Office said Knight was out on bail in a pending robbery case when the alleged hit-and-run occurred. A new bail hearing was set for February 9 and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for February 19. Knight's bail hearing was scheduled for next Monday. He is now being held in jail without bail. The incident came less than six months after Knight was shot six times at a West Hollywood nightclub in August — the second shooting he's survived. No arrests have been made. At 6-foot-4 and weighing 325 pounds, Knight has a reputation as an imposing figure that is credited, in part, with helping create Death Row Records when he strong-armed another label to release Dr. Dre from his contract, said Chuck Creekmur, CEO of allhiphop.com. Knight was at the center of one of the most notorious rap conflicts of the 1990s, pitting Tupac Shakur against Biggie Smalls in an East Coast-versus-West Coast rivalry. Knight was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with Shakur at a Las Vegas hotel, just hours before Shakur was fatally shot while riding in Knight's car just east of the Strip. Smalls, whose real name was Chris Wallace, was shot to death in a similar attack six months later. Knight and Dre later had a falling out, and Dre left.

"Hillary Clinton is letting it be known how she feels about childhood vaccines. The recent grandmother and near certain Democratic presidential candidate did not mince words, keeping her statement brief and to the point by releasing it on Twitter. 'The science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork. Let's protect all our kids. #GrandmothersKnowBest,' wrote the former Secretary of State. This just hours after two other politicians who have been exploring the idea of a presidential run, Republicans Chris Christie and Rand Paul, came under fire for stating they did not believe in mandatory child vaccinations. Scroll down for video . Hillary Clinton (above) has voiced her support for childhood vaccines, saying the 'science is clear' and that they 'work' The potential Democratic presidential candidate kept her statement short and sweet by releasing it on Twitter . Clinton (above with husband Bill and granddaughter Charlotte) also used her tweet as a chance to bring in the family element, with the recent grandmother stressing the importance of protecting children . Governor Christie was touring a biomedical research facility of all places in Cambridge, England when he said of vaccinations; 'Parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that's the balance that the government has to decide.' He did however make it clear that he and his wife had all of their children vaccinated. Now, many are attacking Christie for being 'anti-science,' while members of his own party are wondering if this muted response is a sign that the oft polarizing politician - who is nothing if not direct when answering questions - is toning things down as he sets his sights on a job in the White House. The backlash was so immediate that Christie's camp released a clarification on his statement within just hours. 'To be clear: the Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated,' said spokesman Kevin Roberts according to CNN. 'At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination, which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate.' Chris Christie (left) and Rand Paul (right) both said on Monday that families should have a choice when it comes to vaccines, a statement Christie quickly backtracked on . Christie's office stressed that the New Jersey Governor and his wife Mary Pat (above with Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne on Tuesday) have vaccinated all their children . In stark contrast to Clinton's firm support of vaccinations, and even Christie's middle-of-the-road beliefs, is Senator Paul, a former medical doctor who believes that vaccines should be 'voluntary.' 'While I think it is a good idea to take the vaccine, I think that is a personal decision for individuals,' he said in an interview with conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham. He then took it a step further during an interview with CNBC host Kelly Evans, telling her; 'I have heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.' He capped it all off by saying; 'You know, for most of our history they have been voluntary. So I don't think I'm arguing for anything out of the ordinary. ... I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they are a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input.' And while it is true that the decision whether or not take vaccines, which were first created by Louis Pasteur in the late nineteenth century, has long been voluntary, Paul seems to omit that since their introduction people are living longer, mortality rates have decreased drastically, and overall quality of life has, almost universally, improved drastically for people around the globe as a direct result of vaccinations. What's more, vaccines have managed to eliminate over a dozen infectious diseases in some areas of the world, and in the case of polio, actually eradicate a disease that led to paralysis in millions of Americans. This is why, politics aside, it seems that those most upset with Christie and Paul are parents, with many labeling their comments as irresponsible when delivered at a time when over 100 cases of measles have been reported in 14 states around the country. All of these cases seem to link back to an outbreak that started last December in Disneyland, with officials now believing an American child who had not been vaccinated carried it home from a foreign country. And while measles is an often painful and uncomfortable viral disease, especially for  young child, with high fevers and a red rash covering the body, it is seldom, if ever, fatal. That being said, many are concerned as measles is one of the infectious diseases that had been eliminated from this country since 2000, this entirely thanks to a vaccine first being introduced in 1963, which would in 1971 become the MMR vaccine, protecting children from the mumps and rubella as well. Then, in 1989, a two-part process went into practice during which a child is immunized once as a toddler and again around the age of four or five. This method has proven to be 99% effective and has resulted in a 75% decrease in measles fatalities in the United States. MTV upstarts and moms Jenny McCarthy (left) and Kristin Cavalarri (right) are the two best known members of the anti-vaccination movement . Anti-vaccine supporters have a far different opinion of the measles vaccine, believing that it causes autism in children. This despite the fact that the research paper from which these opinions are derived, which linked autism spectrum disorders to the MMR vaccine was revealed to be 'utterly false' by the editor-in-chief of The Lancet, the medical journal in which it was published. Jenny McCarthy, who, alongside MTV reality star turned designer Kristin Cavallari, is the best known member of the group, became a supporter after her son Evan was diagnosed with autism. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama, himself a father to two young daughter, showed his support for child vaccinations over the weekend, telling NBC News; 'There is every reason to get vaccinated — there aren’t reasons to not.' He closed out be saying; 'You should get your kids vaccinated. It's good for them, but we should be able to get back to the point where measles effectively is not existing in this country.'","Hillary Clinton voiced her firm support for childhood vaccines on  Monday .
The potential Democratic presidential candidate wrote that 'the science is clear' when it comes to vaccines, adding '#GrandmothersKnowBest'
Earlier in the day potential Republican candidates Chris Christie and Rand Paul came under fire for speaking out against mandatory vaccines .
Christie's team issued a statement almost immediately after he made the comments, saying how 'important' vaccines are to the United States .
This as there have now been over 100 cases of measles in just the past two months, which had been eliminated from the U.S. since 2000 .
Officials believe this current outbreak started when an American child who had not been vaccinated caught the viral infection while traveling overseas ."
"Kim Lindfield was found dead in Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester after attempting overdoses in the past. Her family have said she was treated 'like a time-waster' A charity worker who had attempted suicide a dozen times was failed by doctors when she was admitted to hospital after taking an overdose, an inquest heard. Kim Lindfield was not given a mental health assessment despite suffering severe depression for years. The 27-year-old, who felt doctors saw her as an attention seeker and a time-waster, was left on a ward without proper monitoring even though she had warned she would try again to kill herself. Hours after her admission to Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester, Ms Lindfield was found hanged by her hospital bed by nurses carrying out their rounds - having earlier left her cubicle curtains ajar in the hope of being found. Staff tried to revive her but she died six days later when her family agreed to let doctors switch off her life support machine. In the hours before her death, Ms Lindfield, from Wythenshawe had told a worker 'there's no point' when asked what she wanted for tea - but her comment was treated as a remark about the quality of hospital food. At inquest into her death a coroner recorded a verdict of death by misadventure contributed to by neglect. The coroner condemned hospital staff for 'serious and significant failures' and said a referral to mental health experts would have saved Ms Lindfield's life. He also branded the hospital's investigation into the tragedy as 'lamentable' after it emerged some staff on duty at the time of the tragedy were not even asked to give statements. Ms Lindfield's mother, Kerry Bentley, 52, said today: 'We have listened to a lack of co-operation and communication, compounded by mismanagement, lack of compassionate care lack of record keeping and a frightening confusion among senior staff regarding the hospital's own policies and procedures. 'Unfortunately, despite pleading with her many times over the years, Kim did not involve us in her mental health care. Her intention was never to die but she mentioned to friends and counsellors how variable the care would be on visits to the hospital. 'Sometimes she had a good experience but sometimes she felt largely ignored and regarded as an attention seeker and time-waster. 'No one would regard a patient suffering from cancer or a heart complaint as a nuisance but people suffering mental illness come across attitudes like this all the time. 'There has been a lot of talk about the need for more compassion in the NHS. We would argue that a person suffering from mental illness could be deemed to be most in need of this. 'From the evidence at the inquest we know there was a catalogue of missed opportunities for psychiatric referral from Kim's arrival at A&E.' An inquest heard Ms Lindfield had become depressed after she was branded a 'grass' by noisy neighbours . The tragedy occurred in July 2012 after Ms Lindfield - who hoped to become a paramedic and was described by her family as 'a beautiful, funny, intelligent, creative and caring young woman' - had been battling mental illness for up to 13 years. She had Borderline Personality Disorder which meant she had a fear of 'rejection and abandonment.' She was a youth volunteer for St John Ambulance and had won awards for her voluntary work. Her commitment to St John's Ambulance was recognised with the Grand Prior Award, which was given to her by Princess Anne at Buckingham Palace. Ms Lindfield enrolled at Manchester Metropolitan University to study Applied Community Studies but suffered a break down due to the stress of studying and being away. Despite concerns over her welfare, she later appeared to rally and moved into a flat in Wythenshawe but her mental condition worsened after she complained of being hounded by noisy neighbours. She filed a complaint to housing officials about loud music being played next to her rented flat - but she ended up being labelled a 'grass.' After applying for an alarm to fitted to her home for fear of having intruders, she was admitted to Wythenshawe Hospital in July 2012 with a suspected overdose of medication. Shortly after her admission she told staff she was feeling down and 'stressed' about her neighbours. A coroner heard Ms Lindfield told a nurse there was 'no point' when asked if she wanted a cup of tea . The hospitals - whose staff assumed Ms Lindfield was complaining about food - have now apologised . Care support worker Michelle O'Donnell said: 'I was asked to take her out for cigarette which is a routine duty. Outside she said she was fed up. She was sick of her neighbours annoying her. She had trouble with her neighbours. She was fed up. 'She couldn't be bothered anymore. She wanted to do it again and she said she would do it again when she got home. I asked if she had anyone she could talk to. I told the first staff nurse I saw on the ward and whoever it was just said leave it with me.' Patient Leanne Graham said she had been speaking to Miss Lindfield in the minutes before the tragedy and said: 'It was pretty mundane conversation really - like she'd been on the ward too long. The last time I saw Kimberley, she was lying on the bed.' Mrs Graham went to the bathroom and noticed the curtains around the bed had been drawn slightly but added: 'The only time she knew something serious had happened was when the nurse rushed in and the alarm went off.' The hearing was told Kim self harmed to 'alleviate stress.' She had bags packed with clothes for several days and talked of holidays and returning to her studies - indicating there was no intention to end her own life. Dr Dinesh Maganty, a consultant forensic psychiatrist at Birmingham NHS who prepared a report on Kim said: 'She was impulsive and took risks which explains why she had taken overdoses as she was 'going to the edge'. She was always anticipating that she would be found which explains that on a previous overdose, she remained calm, was extremely helpful to paramedics and had written a list of exactly what she had taken. 'On the day she was admitted no mental health assessment was taken and there was nothing on record. There is absolutely no question that a mental health assessment would have helped. She had no intention of dying.' The inquest heard Ms Lindfield had moved to a property in Wythenshawe, Manchester but felt intimidated . Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows said hospital staff should have kept records about when Kim should be kept under observation but there was 'nothing of note recorded.' He added: 'Kim was a well-loved young woman who suffered from recurrent depressive episodes which led to self-harming to relieve inner tension. She was vulnerable to certain life pressures but there was no evidence to suggest she was contemplating the taking of her own life. 'There was a series of significant failures to refer her for a mental health assessment especially as she had attempted an overdose 12 times previously. The fact that she had the curtains closed slightly around her bed suggested that she wanted to be found. 'Observations on Kim should have been increased. It is possible had she been referred as soon as possible for a mental health assessment her life would have been saved or prolonged. ' In a statement Dr John Crampton, Medical director at University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust (UHSM), said: 'The Trust would again wish to convey its sincere condolences to the family of Ms Kimberley Lindfield. 'We are sincerely sorry for their loss and we will cooperate fully with the Coroner's recommendations to further improve on the changes the Trust has already implemented. 'Following the sad death of Ms Lindfield in July 2012, we have been focusing on improving and strengthening our processes for assessing and treating patients with mental health conditions who present to our Emergency Department and who are subsequently admitted to our wards. 'We would like to apologise unreservedly to the family of Ms Lindfield, our hearts go out to them. 'We would again wish to reiterate our invitation to her family to meet with senior representatives at UHSM if they feel this would be helpful for them.' Since Ms Lindfield's death, her family and friends have set up the Kim Lindfield Trust to raise money for charity 42nd Street.

"Universities minister Greg Clark said student fees were a 'phenomenal investment' A Tory minister has insisted £9,000-a-year tuition fees are not too expensive – because it only costs the same as a 'posh coffee' to pay them back every day. Universities Minister Greg Clark said if graduates earn £30,000 a year they have to pay back £2.22 a day, which he claimed was a 'phenomenal investment'. Labour said the Cambridge-graduate's 'bizarre' remarks showed the Government was out of touch with public concern over the cost of university. The Coalition increased the cap on student fees from £3,000 to £9,000 a year to fill the hole in university funding left by cuts to the higher education budget. But, because student debts are written off after 30 years, just under half the money will never be recouped, meaning the scheme will cost the government £2.5billion a year more than ministers claimed, House of Commons library figures show. At the same time average graduate debts have doubled from £20,000 in 2010 to £43,500. Labour's wants to reduce the cap on fees to £6,000 a year before scrapping the system altogether and replacing it with a 'graduate tax' on earnings. But Mr Clark, who attended his local comprehensive in Middlesbrough before making his fortune in business after graduating with a PHD in economics, said student fees were good value for money. The Conservative minister, speaking at a science and engineering debate at the Royal Society last month, said: 'First of all it is important that we don't distract from the fact that for students under the system that we have, if you have a great education you only pay back if you're earning over £21,000 and only 9 per cent of your earnings above that. 'What that means is if you earn £30,000 as a graduate you bay back £2.22 a day, now there are people who buy cups of posh coffee for less than that, and I think people recognise that that is a phenomenal investment, it's not just a good investment for the student, but actually it's a good investment for the taxpayer.' Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna attacked the remarks. He told MailOnline: 'These bizarre remarks from Universities Minister Greg Clark show just how out of touch Tory ministers are on the huge costs and debts now facing students. 'They demonstrate a deeply dismissive attitude towards the real concerns which students and parents have on the cost of a degree. 'The Tory-led government trebled fees, cut funding for universities and saddled both students and the taxpayer with a mountain of debt, and we have recently learned that the average student debt now stands at £43,500 – more than double what it was under the old system.' Mr Clark (second right), speaking at the Royal Society, said graduates earning £30,000 a year have to pay back £2.22 a day - the price of a coffee . Starbucks coffees can cost more than £3 each . At Waterloo station, just over the river from the House of Commons, a posh coffee costs considerably more than £2.22. A ‘grande’ – or medium – Caramel Machiato will set coffee lovers back £3.40. This works out at £1,241 a year. Over 30 years, which is the amount of time graduates are expected to repay their student loans, a daily Machiato hit will cost £37,230. But this is still below the average £43,500 debt currently being racked up by students. Mr Umunna said a new graduate tax system would be 'fairer' than tuition fees and would be introduced 'in the medium term' if Labour returns to power. The National Union of Students proposed an extra tax of between 0.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent of their income above £15,000, for a period of 20 years, with the highest earners paying higher rates. Labour is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees to £6,000 a year. Previously, Labour has suggested that it might pay for the cut with a corporation tax increase on banks or with higher rates of interest for better-off students. The party may also be forced to restrict the cut in fees to certain types of courses such as technical degrees, leaving other students to keep on paying the current cost. Mr Umunna, who is responsible for higher education policy, said introducing a full-scale graduate tax 'as soon as possible is my priority'. But Labour's plan to cut tuition fees to £6,000 a year has been criticised by university bosses, who claim it will inflict 'colossal damage' on the higher education sector. Academics said the move could leave universities £10billion out of pocket and said it was 'implausible' that the government could step in to make up the difference given the state of the public finances. In a letter to the Times, a group of university vice chancellors accused Labour of failing to understand that cutting fees will only benefit richer graduates – because under the present system, people only start paying back their loans once they earn more than £21,000 a year. Student debts are also written off after 30 years. The vice-chancellors said Mr Miliband's plans to lower tuition fees by £3,000 would leave £2billion a year out of pocket. Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna attacked Mr Clark's 'bizarre' remarks . Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has been asked to find the money to fund Ed Miliband's pledge to cut tuition fees to £6,000 a year . They fear future Labour governments would be unable to find an extra £2 billion a year in the present financial climate. Sir Christopher Snowden, vice-chancellor of the University of Surrey, said: 'This is purely a pragmatic issue, that a policy is evolving on the hoof which is not really a practical policy going forward and the potential damage is colossal: . 'I really feel Labour has missed the point here. If you talk to students and to many mums and dads, the £9,000 [fee] is no longer the key topic.' Simon Gaskell, president of Queen Mary University London, added: 'What our students tell us is that clearly the debts incurred through fees is important, but what would be a real game-changer for students, or what can defeat students, is the debt that arises from living expenses while they are at university. 'If money were to be spent to support the most needy students to go to university, subsidising fees is not the way to do it.' But Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls claimed the current system of university financing would leave a 'huge looming charge' for taxpayers as many graduates fail to pay back the cost of their tuition.","EXCLUSIVE: Minister Greg Clark said graduates only pay back £2.22 a day .

"Eating too much shark meat in fish and chips may be harmful to a person's health due to the high level of mercury in some species, a new study shows. High levels of metals including mercury were found in the tissue of 30 dusky, sandbar and great white sharks that were caught in nets off the NSW coast, the Marine Pollution Bulletin found. While fish is a good source of protein, Food Standards Australia New Zealand warns people should only consume some species like shark, marlin, broadbill and swordfish no more than once a week due to higher levels of mercury. Eating too much shark meat in fish and chips may be harmful to a person's health due to the high level of mercury in some species, a new study by the Marine Pollution Bulletin has found . Pregnant women should limit consumption to once a fortnight, the website advises. Analysis of shark tissue in the study found the two highest concentrations of mercury showed two 120g servings of dusky and sandbar shark would exceed the food standard's recommendations for weekly mercury level intake, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The report revealed about 75 percent of samples from dusky sharks and 58 percent from the sandbar surpassed the food standard's mercury limit. Shark fins were also found to have high levels of arsenic, which may cause health problems for people who regularly consume products like shark fin soup, the report stated. High levels of metals including mercury were found in the tissue of 30 dusky, sandbar and great white (pictured) sharks that were caught in nets off the NSW coast, the study found . Shark fins were also found to have high levels of arsenic, which may cause health problems for people who regularly consume products like shark fin soup, the report stated . 'People can safely eat two to three serves a week of most types of fish. However, because of the presence of higher levels of mercury in some fish there are a few types you should limit in your diet, especially if you are pregnant,' Food Standards Australia New Zealand says. 'The named fish may contain more mercury than other species because they are long living fish and/or predators and can accumulate higher levels of mercury by eating other fish.' Sharks store mercury and  arsenic from species they hunt, according to Amanda Reichelt-Brushett, an associate professor at the Marine Ecology Research Centre of the Southern Cross University and co-author of the report. She said while additional research was needed to reveal the toxicity of arsenic found in shark fins, food preparation was unlikely to reduce high concentrations. 'The large males of the species are the ones to avoid in terms of accumulation,' Dr Reichelt-Brushett said.

"Hackers targeted Syrian rebels with online 'honey traps' by posing as beautiful women to steal battle plans and the identity of defectors, a security firm has said. A report by U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye tracked hacking operations in late 2013 and early 2014 that targeted Syrian opposition fighters, media activists and humanitarian aid workers. FireEye said it was unclear whether the information stolen from the Syrian opposition had been passed onto the Syrian government and who the hackers were working for. But the hacked material included a detailed opposition military plan for an attack in 2013 on the town of Khirbet Ghazaleh, strategically located in southern Daraa province. The town had been under rebel control but was seized by regime troops in May 2013. Rebels have been unable to recapture it since. Honey traps: Hackers stole crucial information from Syrian rebels by posing as beautiful women (above) on social media to steal battle plans and the identity of defectors, a U.S. security firm has said in a report . Lured into opening virus: The report by U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye cited this example of a conversation on Skype where hackers pose as pro-opposition women to befriend Syrian rebels then send their victim a photo of themselves loaded with malware that penetrated their personal files and stole information . Similar tactics were also employed on Facebook: The method was particularly effective because Syrian opposition members often share computers, meaning one machine yielded information from multiple victims . Despite the high-tech tools used in the cyber attack, the hackers relied on a well-worn tactic: the 'honey trap.' Targets were contacted on the chat and online phone service Skype by hackers posing as pro-opposition women. They would ask the target whether they were on a smartphone or computer, apparently in a bid to tailor their attacks. Then they would send their victim a photo of themselves loaded with malware that penetrated their personal files and stole information. The method was particularly effective because Syrian opposition members were often sharing computers, meaning one machine yielded information from multiple victims. The material stolen covered extraordinary levels of detail, including the blood types of fighters and the timing of a handover of anti-tank missiles. Information is power: Opposition battle plans were also stolen that included the positions of anti-government forces and, as this map shows, part of an attack plan against an encampment (rectangle) of Assad's troops . Hacked: The material stolen covered extraordinary levels of detail, including the blood types of fighters and the timing of a handover of anti-tank missiles as seen in this redacted conversation between two rebels . But not all of it related to warfare, with information about refugees, opposition media strategy and the inner workings of opposition political structures also included. Most of the stolen material was created between May 2013 and December 2013, though some of it dated back to 2012 and as recently as January 2014. The hackers also used other tactics, including creating fake social media accounts and Syrian opposition websites that encouraged visitors to click on links that would infect their computers. The report said: 'The hackers stole a cache of critical documents and Skype conversations revealing the Syrian opposition's strategy, tactical battle plans, supply needs, and troves of personal information and chat sessions.' The hacking provided 'actionable military intelligence for an immediate battlefield advantage' in the case of the planned Khirbet Ghazaleh attack. Online predators: A graphic showing the number and locations of victims of the honey-trap hackers . Covert: This translated conversation appears to show an attempt by rebel fighters to secure forged passports as Syrians often face tough scrutiny when travelling abroad . It captured 'the type of insight that can thwart a vital supply route, reveal a planned ambush and identify and track key individuals.' FireEye was unable to identify where the hackers it tracked were based, but it noted that their servers were outside of Syria and their tools and tactics differed from previous Syrian hackers. The report's revelations are just the latest evidence of the stealth cyberwar that has accompanied the fighting in Syria's bloody conflict. Pro-government hackers identifying themselves as the Syrian Electronic Army have carried out high-profile attacks against the websites and social media accounts of media outlets and politicians. And in 2012, a British newspaper published what it said were 3,000 emails sent by President Bashar al-Assad and his wife, obtained by opposition hackers with the help of a government mole. Sami Saleh, an opposition activist and hacker using a pseudonym, said such examples were rare because the opposition was generally too poorly-equipped and -backed to carry out major hacking operations. 'We mostly carry out defensive operations,' he told AFP, describing multiple cases where opposition commanders and politicians were targeted by hackers. In one case, a commander in northwestern Idlib province downloaded a file meant to contain military maps, accidentally compromising his computer. 'The cyber-war is about half the war, without exaggeration,' Saleh said.","Report by security firm tracked hacking operations against Syrian rebels .

"A former NHS doctor has been accused of carrying out bungled and unhygienic circumcisions on children at their homes - leaving one baby boy screaming in agony after the anaesthetic wore off half way through the surgery. Dr Mohammed Siddiqui, 49, of Southampton, faces misconduct charges over 47 allegations in relation to four boys that he carried out unhygienic procedures at the homes of four different youngsters  as part of a 'private mobile circumcision service'. The GMC investigation was launched after a complaint by Kelly Braiha and her husband Ghali, from  West Sussex, claiming their 23-month-old son Najem was left 'traumatised' and suffering an infection because Siddiqui did not take hygienic precautions. Dr Mohammed Siddiqui is accused of carrying out bungled circumcisions at the homes of four baby boys while employed as paediatrician at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (pictured) The allegations span a period from June 2012 until November 2013, during which time Dr Siddiqui was employed as a Clinical Fellow in paediatric surgery at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. A tribunal heard today that the doctor operated a private mobile children's circumcision service away from his  job at the hospital - but was accused by parents of not washing his hands prior to treatment and at times of not wearing surgical gloves, failing to carry out proper examinations and not having proper resuscitation equipment including oxygen and airway equipment. It is claimed that when one little boy suffered an adverse reaction to local anaesthetic Siddiqui did not realise he was having a seizure and failed to act immediately to ensure an ambulance was called. The tribunal heard during another procedure, a mother became concerned about her baby screaming and asked Dr Siddiqui questions - but it is alleged he pushed her hand away and said: 'leave him he's fine.' It is alleged he then pretended to take a telephone call to avoid answering further questions. After the parent of a third circumcised boy rang Siddiqui to say his son was still in pain, it was claimed Siddiqui failed to respond and accused him of 'telling lies' The parents of a fourth boy claim Siddiqui carried surgical materials in plastic carrier bags and used baby wipes and paper towels during the procedure, which was of such a poor standard he had to carry out another circumcision on the same child the following day. Despite the boy suffering injuries from the operation as too much skin was removed, Dr Siddiqui failed to refer him to a hospital and then ignored his parents when they expressed concerns over his condition, it was claimed. Doctor Siddiqui admits carrying out the procedures but denies that his practices were unhygienic or inadequate in any way (file image) Following complaints it emerged Siddiqui had failing to secure valid insurance for each procedure and failed to register his circumcision service with the Care Quality Commission. He was initially suspended from his post and stopped carrying out the procedures and has since resigned from the NHS and surrendered his GMC registration. But at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service Siddiqui said he was contemplating starting up his circumcision business again and he even asked the panel to adjourn the case so he could earn money from the enterprise to fund his legal fees. The request was refused. Male circumcision is widely practiced in Muslim communities and is not illegal in Britain. As it is classed as 'consensual assault', similar to tattooing, anyone can legally carry it out. Circumcision is only available through the NHS if there are compelling medical reasons, though local GP's may carry out the operation themselves. Healthcare workers usually have to be registered with the CQC if they want to perform home circumcisions but there is no legal requirement. The hearing was previously told the families of the boys from Southampton, Bath, Birmingham and Reading had wanted their children circumcised for religious or cultural reasons. Ben Fitzgerald, counsel for the GMC,  said: 'He performed or attempted to perform circumcisions on four infant boys at their homes between June 2012 and November 2013. 'At the time he was a paediatric surgeon but also in a private capacity operated a mobile children's circumcision service carrying out circumcisions in the community for parents who wished their sons to undergo them for religious or cultural reasons. 'Having been engaged he would attend their home addresses on the day bringing with him the equipment he needed to carry it out. 'He would obtain consent on the day and would leave behind information providing advice on aftercare. Ideally it would be quick and simple - meeting once and moving on. 'The GMC's case is that Mr Siddiqui's conduct in relation to the four patients fell below the standard required of a doctor carrying out procedures. 'There was a lack of care when carrying out procedures, a rush to get them done and a lack of appropriate regard and respect for the parents who engaged his services. 'In relation to patients A, B and C, he failed to obtain properly informed consent. While he obtained a signature on a consent form and provided some information, his rush to perform the procedures and impatience in answering questions meant he did not engage properly with them. 'In October 2012, he treated Patient B's mother with a lack of respect, by pushing her hand away when she reacted to Patient B's scream at having his foreskin pulled back. In response to her alarm at his treatment of Patient B he said to her 'leave him, he's fine', or words to that effect. 'When questioned by Patient B's mother about the circumcision, he pretended that he had to take a telephone call to avoid answering her and when questioned further, Mr Siddiqui said ""I'm not getting into this"" and walked out of the house.' Dr Siddiqui also failed to obtain adequate histories of each boy he was performed the procedure, it was said, as well as failing to make sure his equipment was aseptic. Mr Fitzgerald added: 'Patient A appears to have suffered an adverse reaction to anaesthetisation and required an ambulance and emergency medical intervention. 'Mr Siddiqui should not have administered a local anaesthetic without access to the minimum resuscitation facilities. 'He treated parents with a lack of respect - from failing to attend to their concerns to threatening and dishonest behaviour Patient C was screaming during a procedure, providing an indication that the anaesthetic was not working properly. 'He should have stopped but he simply carried on. 'You may hear evidence in the course of the hearing about the benefits of a surgeon providing the circumcision service to those who want it for religious reasons and conducting them at home. 'It is important to make clear it is not the GMC's case that he should not have been carrying out procedures in the home at all, rather that he failed in numerous respects to meet the basic standards that should be expected of any doctor operating in this environment.' Siddiqui admits carrying out the procedures but denies that his practices were unhygienic or inadequate in any way. He said: 'I've stopped doing circumcisions since I stopped getting correspondence from the CQC but I could. 'I do not need to register with the CQC when I'm suspended but I stopped it for numerous reasons. 'I still am not doing it but I know i can. I can restart doing circumcisions and can finance legal representation. I may start and finance the legal side of it.' The hearing, expected to last up to four weeks, continues.","Dr Mohammed Siddiqui, 49, faces 47 allegations in relation to four boys .

"A Florida congressman got into a heated argument with a colleague during a House of Rules Committee hearing after claiming that Texas was 'a crazy state' and refusing to apologize. During the Monday meeting on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Florida Democrat Rep. Alcee L. Hastings got into a dispute with Texas Republican Rep. Michael C. Burgess. In the midst of the discussion, Hastings said to Burgess: 'Had governors worked with the administration, we might not be in this position. I don't know about in your state, which I think is a crazy state to begin with - and I mean that just as I said it.' Scroll down for video . During a House Rules Committee hearing on Monday regarding a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Florida Democrat Rep. Alcee L Hastings (pictured) got into a dispute with Texas Republican Rep. Michael C Burgess (file photo) Burgess reads before a House Rules Committee meeting on Monday. After Hastings called Texas a 'crazy state', Burgess replied, saying it was 'very defamatory statement' that he refused to listen . North Carolina Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx, who was filling in for Texas Republican Rep. Pete Sessions as the panel's chairman, tried to step in by cutting off Hastings for interrupting Burgess. Burgess said: 'The gentleman made a very defamatory statement about my state and I will not stand here and listen to it.' Hastings told Burgess he didn't have to listen, and replied: 'I told you what I think about Texas - I wouldn't live there for all the tea in China.' Burgess said that he did not see 'the value of a member in this rules committee hurling invective towards a state and it's people and its governor'. The argument spawned out of a discussion over states that did not create their own insurance exchanges, or online price comparison websites where consumers can purchase health insurance, which are the topic of a pending Supreme Court Case. The discussion quickly digressed when Hastings criticized Burgess's state of Texas, according to Roll Call. North Carolina Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx, who was filling in for Texas Republican Rep Pete Sessions as the panel's chairman, tried to step in by cutting off Hastings (pictured) for interrupting Burgess. But Hastings stood by his opinions . When Burgess asked for an apology, Hastings said he would have to 'wait until hell freezes over' for him to give an apology. 'I would apologize to you if I was directing my comments to you. I was commenting about the state that you happen to be a resident in,' he said. Burgess urged that Hasting's claims were 'uncalled for' and didn't understand why any lawmaker would say such a thing. Sessions returned at the end of the meeting, saying he 'became aware of the dialogue that took place'. He went on to say: 'I love our United States. I would say it's a great country and for us to work together is important.' The dispute underscored the debates that have long surrounded President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. The House of Representatives has voted more than 50 times to roll back all or parts of the law.

"A disgraced Nigerian doctor who killed a British man by injecting him with a massive dose of painkillers is now suing a German author because he mentioned the incident in his book. Daniel Ubani killed David Gray after giving him ten times the correct amount of diamorphine at his home in Cambridgeshire while he was working a locum. He is already trying to sue the victim's son for branding him a killer despite a coroner ruling the death was manslaughter. Now he wants judges at Cologne State Court to rule against author Dr Udo Ulfkotte, claiming that no mention should be made again of the incident or that he is Nigerian by birth. Legal action: Nigerian doctor Daniel Ubani (left) is suing German author Dr Udo Ulfkotte (right) for mentioning the fact that he killed a British patient by injecting him with ten times the correct dose of painkillers . Dr Ulfkotte, 50, who currently has a book at number three in the bestselling chart in Germany called 'Bought Journalism', is aghast at the lawsuit which he promises to fight 'tooth and nail.' He said: 'If I was Dr Ubani, I would be ashamed to be involved in this after what he did. 'At first, my publisher and I laughed when we got his lawyer's letter, but he is deadly serious. 'He thinks no mention should ever be made again of his mistake which caused a man to die.' Ubani's latest attempt to silence anyone who mentions the incident comes at a time when he is still involved in litigation against Dr Rory Gray, son of the man he killed, who also lives in Germany. Ubani, who lives in the west German industrial town of Witten, went to the UK in 2008 as a locum because he wanted extra money. He was working for an out-of-hours medical service when he gave 70-year-old Mr Gray a fatal injection in Cambridgeshire. Ubani confused the amount of painkiller he should give renal patient Mr Gray and injected him with ten times the dosage of diamorphine he should have done. Mr Gray died within minutes at his home in Manea, Cambridgeshire, on 16 February 2008. Dr Ubani is seeking tens of thousands of pounds in compensation from Dr Ulfkotte over a passage in his 2011  book called 'Nightmare Migration' (above) which mentions the incident in which he killed David Gray in 2008 . Coroner William Morris later ruled his death 'gross negligence and manslaughter' and issued 11 recommendations to the Department of Health for the improvement of out-of-hours GP services. An arrest warrant was issued in the UK for Ubani to be extradited to stand trial. But he cut a dubious deal with German prosecutors that allowed him to receive a fine - by post - together with a nine-month suspended jail sentence for causing death by negligence. His ability to work in Germany was never questioned despite the fact he was struck off by the General Medical Council (GMC) in Britain. He refused to attend the inquest into his victim and the medical hearings which barred him from ever working in Britain again. The German Doctors Chamber, the equivalent of the GMC in the UK, wanted Ubani struck off. But they are powerless to force him to go while he still retains the support of the local authority which licenses him. David Gray's sons Dr Stuart Gray, who lives in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, and his brother Rory, who works as a European Space Agency scientist in Darmstadt, have been campaigning to get Ubani struck off in Germany. Rory Gray is still battling demands from Ubani for compensation after he branded him a killer and a charlatan at a plastic surgery conference he was speaking at five years ago. Now Dr Ulfkotte, 50, finds himself enmeshed in litigation, with Ubani seeking tens of thousands of pounds in compensation. It stems from a passage in a book written by him called 'Nightmare Migration' in 2011 about the effects of immigration on societies in Europe. 'Part of this, a very small part, was articles taken from the BBC and from British newspapers about the Ubani case,' said Dr Ulfkotte. 'It mentioned what he did and the death of Dr Gray. It was not racist and never intended to be. 'It wasn't until just recently that myself and my publisher received from Ubani's lawyers his complaint that the book violates his human rights and that no mention should be made of his name or this incident, or indeed his race, the fact that he is barred from ever working as a doctor in the UK again or the fact that he had ever worked there. 'It is crazy. It was a very small chapter and it was all true. I do not know how he can carry on like this considering what he did to Mr Gray.' The hearing against him and his publisher is scheduled for May 20. He said: 'I am confident that common sense will prevail but you never know what will happen in a courtroom. 'Even if he loses, I am sure he will appeal all the way to the European Court of Justice. He thinks he is a supreme medical man who should never be challenged.' Dr Ubani has not responded to calls requesting comment.","Daniel Ubani killed David Gray with massive dose of diamorphine in 2008 .

"A Naval lieutenant is under investigation for trying to record women shipmates when they were in the restroom of an aircraft carrier. The 33-year-old  was part of training exercises off the southern California coast when the junior officer was found holding a video device up to a ventilation grate to see inside the ladies' room. The sailor aboard the Washington state-based John C Stennis  was seen on Jan 29 by a woman who later identified him, according to a document seen by the Navy Times. A lieutenant temporarily aboard the John C Stennis, pictured in 2004, is being investigated for allegedly filming women in the bathroom . The lieutenant reportedly said 'sorry' when he was first seen and then quickly left. His recording device was confiscated by the ship's security after he was later found in the ship's mess cabin. The suspected cameraman was flown off of the aircraft carrier and taken back to his normal chain of command, said spokesman Cmdr. Jeanette Groeneveld, the Kitsap Sun reported. Pacific fleet commander Admiral Harry B Harris wrote in 2013 policy statement that any sailors found guilty of sexual harassment would be disciplined when appropriate, though exact punishments and offences were not named. The incident is the second such investigation in the past two months for soldiers trying to film women comrades in the bathroom. Up to 12 people were implicated in the previous incident, where a sailor allegedly recorded his female shipmates in the shower over a period of 10 months on the USS Wyoming submarine and distributed it among his friends. The John Stennis's commanding officer, Capt. Mike Wettlaufer, said he was 'extremely disappointed in the alleged misconduct' and noted that the lieutenant was only temporarily aboard his ship. However, the commander said that he was pleased a member of his team took action to stop the behavior. Military branches have come under increased scrutiny for not preventing sexual assault and harassment. Above, John C Stennis sailors in 2012 shop while stationed in the Arabian Sea . He added that the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) investigation was able to start promptly. Military branches including the Navy have faced increased criticism in recent years for allegedly presiding over an atmosphere that discourages women from reporting harassment and sexual assault. The Department of Defense gave a report to the White House about sexual assault prevention in December shortly after releasing news of the submarine incident and said that 'major improvements' had been made. The report said that assaults had declined while reporting of assaults increased from 3,600 in fiscal year 2012 to nearly 6,000 in fiscal year 2014. As of January 30, no formal charges had been filed in the USS Wyoming case. The John C Stennis's commanding officer Capt. Michael Wettlaufer, pictured in 2013, said he was 'extremely disappointed' about the incident .

"A couple caught having an office romp by a bar full of drinkers are both in serious relationships and failed to show up for work on Tuesday, it has emerged. The sexual antics of a man and a young woman at insurance firm Marsh Ltd in Christchurch were caught on camera last Friday night after pub patrons across the road noticed the amorous couple had left the lights on. But it has since emerged the man - a senior employee at the firm - is married and the woman, in her 20s, had become recently engaged, the New Zealand Herald reports. Scroll down for video . The young couple get to know each other in the Marsh Ltd offices in Christchurch . Marsh Ltd told the NZ Herald that neither employee was at work on Tuesday. The company is conducting an investigation and the woman has deleted her Facebook account. It comes after the romp caught the eye of revellers at the Carlton Bar and Eatery across the street, who then posted images on Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. The incident provoked a huge reaction with one witness saying that because it went on for 'a good half hour', patrons in the bar 'started to get bored and drift off back to the dance floor'. ‘The entire bar united in cheering them on,’ said one person on social network Reddit. ‘It started with a casual flirt. Then the kiss, grabbing the attention of all. Get it, son! Finally they moved to the back of them room, thinking they were unseen. Off comes the tights, down goes his head. By this stage, 50 bar patrons were pressed up against the window yelling their approval. ‘To be honest, after watching them f*** for a good half hour, people started to get bored and drift off back to the dancefloor.’ The couple had gone into the office after it had closed thinking they'd get some privacy when they were actually being watched by patrons across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery . Before long the pair start to undress in the office unaware that they were being watched . The couple even enjoyed a glass of wine as they enjoyed their own private party . Customers across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery got a front-row seat for the show . However, it got so steamy at one stage that the band even stopped playing in the bar. But when calm was restored the cheeky musicians started up again with Kings of Leon song, Sex on Fire. 'The band had to delay playing because the customers felt the need to support this view. Props to them for their next song being Sex on Fire,' one Reddit user said. Rabobank’s branding was also in many pictures on social media, only because it had naming rights to the building. Not that they escaped ridicule either. ‘Congrats to the man who made a deposit at Rabobank this evening,’ one Twitter follower posted. One Reddit user said: 'I guess it's not a bank for money.' While another also quipped on Reddit: 'When he withdrew he lost interest!' Twitter user Nick can't help making a quip about the couple and their antics . It got so steamy that the band even stop playing in the Carlton Bar and Eatery as the action continued . The Privacy Commissioner John Edwards told Radio New Zealand that there was little the sexy pair could do legally following some local backlash against those who filmed the incident in the bar. Several commentators in New Zealand claimed that the couple's privacy had been breached, but Mr Edwards said it was unlikely the police could take action if a complaint was made. ‘The people who were watching, we may criticise them for a lapse of decency in taking advantage of that, but it is unlikely there'd be any legal liability for their action,’ he said. Privacy lawyer Kathryn Dalziel also told Radio New Zealand even though the couple did not give their consent for the images to be taken, they would have to show their privacy had been breached to make a successful case under the Crimes Act. Revellers at the Carlton Bar and Eatery posted images on Facebook and Twitter of the couple . Marsh Ltd said on Tuesday they still had not made any decision on whether the couple would get the sack or face any disciplinary action. ‘We are not giving any further comment other than what has already been provided. We’re dealing with the matter internally that’s all we can say,' a spokeswoman for Marsh Ltd told Daily Mail Australia. 'It’s unknown what will happen to those involved at this stage, and what final decision will be made by the firm.’","Man pictured in office romp is married and the woman recently engaged .

"Doctors have been left baffled after a Chinese pensioner woke from a two-week coma speaking perfect English - but not a word of her native language. Liu Jieyu, 94, had been unconscious for a fortnight after suffering a stroke, which doctors had feared she may not recover from. When she finally awoke, the retired teacher asked in perfect English: 'Where am I? What is happening?' Surprised doctors were left even more confused when it became clear Ms Jieyu - who used to teach English - had lost all ability to speak her native Chinese. Liu Jey woke up from a two week coma, speaking only English and not her native Chinese . An English-speaking doctor was brought in to talk to the pensioner, who confirmed she was speaking the language perfectly - although a little slowly. Her shocked family say while Ms Jieyu had taught English previously, she had not spoken the language in more than 30 years. They say said she had stopped using English after retiring to live with her family on the outskirts of the city of Changsha, in southern China's Hunan province. Medic Tao Hou, 45,  said: 'I can't ever remember having a case like this before but we anticipate with proper rehabilitation and rest she should regain the ability to speak Chinese. 'We assume that the area dealing with her ability to speak Chinese has been damaged, but brain cells to have an ability to repair themselves to a certain extent we would hope to see at least some improvement.' Ms Jieyu was admitted to hospital after suffering a type of stroke called a cerebral infarction, where the blood supply is limited rather than instantly cut off by a blockage. The 94-year-old - who has not spoken English since she taught the language 30 years ago - has left doctors baffled . Doctors at the hospital say they are baffled by the case - but hope she will start speaking Chinese again once she begins to recover . However, she is not the only person to wake up from a coma speaking another language. Australian Ben McMahon woke up able to speak Mandarin after being involved in a car accident, while a 13-year-old Croatian girl woke up having replaced her fluency in her native language with speaking German. There was also the case of a U.S. navy veteran was found unconscious in a motel room who had no recollection of who he was and woke up speaking fluent Swedish. A Queensland Brain Institute neuroscientist suggested a possible explanation last year. Dr Pankaj Sah said the brain was made up of different circuits - which assist in language, breathing, speaking and thinking - similar to electronic circuits. According to him, it is possible in Ben's case that the parts of the brain which recalled English were damaged in the crash and those that retained Mandarin were activated when the 22-year-old woke up. Whether this is what happened to Ms Jieyu is not known. More commonly, people are known to have woken up with a different accent, like in the case of Kath Locket, who was born and bred in Stafford. But after she was rushed into hospital unable to speak or swallow, she developed a strong accent which was distinctly European. Foreign Accent Syndrome  is speech disorder that causes a sudden change to speech so that a native speaker is perceived to speak with a “foreign” accent. Foreign Accent Syndrome is most often caused by damage to the brain caused by a stroke or traumatic brain injury. Other causes have also been reported including multiple sclerosis and conversion disorder. In some cases no clear cause has been identified. Speech may be altered in terms of timing, intonation, and tongue placement, so that is perceived as sounding foreign. Listeners can usually still understand the sufferer's speech; it does not necessarily sound disordered. Foreign Accent Syndrome has been documented in cases around the world, including accent changes from Japanese to Korean, British English to French, American-English to British English, and Spanish to Hungarian. There have only ever been 150 confirmed cases of Foreign Accent Syndrome in the world so far.","Liu Jieyu woke up after suffering a stroke unable to speak Chinese .

"A woman has overcome a five-year battle with depression which saw her sectioned and try to end her own life, and is now determined her experience will help others. During her darkest period Aimee Wilson, 23, from Blyth, had to be forcibly medicated in hospital, following two attempted overdoses and was placed on a ventilator. But now, having come through the other side, Aimee has launched an online blog to help other sufferers of mental health problems by showing it is possible to recover and move forward. Amiee hopes sharing her story on her blog will give hope to others struggling with mental health problems . Aimee, who has been diagnosed with a personality disorder, was first sectioned at the age of 18, beginning a five-year battle with her mental health. The professionals who treated her believe the mental health problems which swamped her were sparked by sexual abuse she suffered in her teenage years. Aimee's downward spiral was so great that she became determined to end her life. She attempted suicide twice through an overdose, once in June 2012 and again in October 2013. On both occasions, when she refused the treatment needed to save her life, she was sedated and placed on a life support machine under the Mental Capacity Act. Even once she was off the ventilator, doctors had no option but to deliver her medication forcibly through tubes, and Aimee would often try and pull out her drips. An overdose saw Amiee placed on life support. During her stay in hospital she attempted to pull out the lines giving her medication in a further attempt to end her life . But less than six months later, the 23-year-old is looking to the future after getting her own flat and starting over again. She said: 'I had got used to the idea that I would end up killing myself and that I wouldn't grow old. 'I wanted to die so much, I was using my toes to try to pull out the treatment tubes when I was in hospital. 'But I feel really positive now. I can't believe I have come this far. 'I think it's important for people to know there is always hope and you can get better.' Aimee's problems began when she endured six months of sexual abuse by a man she knew. So terrified she would not be believed, the then-schoolgirl never reported the attacks to police. However, the mental scars stayed with Aimee throughout her teenage years. And as she sat her A-levels she said she began to hear voices in her head. At the beginning of December Aimee moved into her own flat, and as well as writing her blog (left) has begun volunteering for a charity that helps blind veterans . As the stress of exams and her undiagnosed condition got on top of her, Aimee began taking high doses of prescription medicine in an attempt to block out her feelings. Then one day she passed out and was taken to hospital. She was eventually sectioned for two weeks at the St Nicholas mental health hospital in Gosforth, Newcastle. 'It all happened so quickly,' she said. 'One minute I was revising for my exams and the next I was in a mental hospital. 'I was terrified. I had no idea about mental health problems. I just thought I must be going crazy. 'Because I was 18 I had to go on an adult ward and I was with people who had been really unwell for a long time. It was really scary.' Aimee spent the next three years in and out of hospital, attempting suicide twice, and in 2011 was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Personality disorders typically emerge in adolescence and persist into adulthood. BPD is best understood as a disorder of mood and how a person interacts with others. Many people with the condition self-harm and attempt suicide . It is estimated that 60-70% of people with BPD will attempt suicide at some point in their life. BPD can cause a range of distressing symptoms and patterns of abnormal behaviour, including: . Source: NHS . 'They had to give me the drugs through tubes because I just wanted to die,'  Aimee said. In July 2012 Aimee was transferred to a specialist hospital in Yorkshire, and began her journey to recovery. As she recovered she decided to tell people what had happened to her for the first time, writing of her experiences on a blog. Entitled I'm Not Disordered, Aimee's honest account of her battle with mental illness has now been viewed more than 62,000 times. 'I started it two years ago, while I was in hospital,' she said. 'At first I didn't have much faith in it and I didn't realise how big it would become. 'But I have now had so many positive comments. I had kept my mental health problems a secret for all these years. 'No one talks about mental illness. 'Even when celebrities do come forward they are always quite guarded about what they say.' Aimee was discharged from the Yorkshire hospital last September. 'Almost as quickly as it started it ended,' Aimee said. 'All of a sudden I didn't want to kill myself. 'I wanted to live my life and recover.' On her blog she explains: 'As I progressed through my recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder, I'd like to think that my blog now also provides people with hope, and determination. 'That people read it and see that you can feel completely and utterly worthless and hopeless to the point where you think the only way to get any relief is to end your life, and you can come back from that; you can be happy again. You can enjoy being alive again. 'Being in recovery doesn't mean my life runs smoothly. It doesn't mean I don't feel how I used to or have those thoughts again. And it doesn't mean I've forgotten how hard life used to be, or how much hard work I've had to put in. I'm forever grateful.' At the beginning of December last year Aimee moved into her own flat in Blyth and has begun volunteering for a charity that helps blind veterans. She has also been asked to take part in research studies at universities and to be part of a panel to improve services for mental health patients.

"A 61-year-old man was overcome with joy when he went to Grand Rapids, Michigan last month to encounter a man, 81, he believed to be the father he never met. However, paternity results obtained yesterday reveal the pair are not related after all. Samuel Childress, received the test results in the mail on Monday, February 2 and was shocked to see it was negative, said his wife Donna Childress on Tuesday morning. 'It's been rough on him,' she said of her husband finding out the results. 'He's been up and down all night.' The unfortunate maternity muddle began when Tony Trapani, 81, of Grand Rapids was cleaning out some filing cabinets following the death of his wife when he discovered a 56-year-old letter. The note had been hidden from him by his wife and was from a woman claiming that she had given birth to a son, and he was the father, reports Michigan Live. New friendship: Samuel Childress (left) is pictured with Tony Trapani (right) last month after a letter from Childress' mother led Trapani to believe that Samuel Childress was his son . The letter: A letter says Samuel Childress is Tony Trapani's son but a paternity result revealed on February 2 proves that the pair are not related . Bond: Despite the men not being father and son like this found letter stated, they will remain friends and continue to build a father and son bond . Trapani reached out to Childress and the two men tearfully embraced believing they were related. They spent a week bonding with one another and decided to take a paternity test to make sure the news wan't too good to be true. Despite the paternity results being negative, the men have chosen to continue a relationship with on another. 'They're keeping that bond,' said Donna Childress. 'That paper doesn't mean anything to him. That bond has been made - and we're going to move on from here.' Years ago, Childress resigned himself to the fact that he had been abandoned by his father. Even though Trapani may not be his father by blood the men have become close and will act as though they are father and son. As for why Trapani's wife would hide the misleading letter from Childress' mother for all these years, Trapani points out the difficulties the couple faced trying to have children of their own. 'She wanted children,' said Trapani of his late wife in an interview with Fox 17. 'She couldn't have any. She tried and tried.' That being said, Trapani still seems to resent her decision, no matter what her motivation may have been, saying; 'He's my full son that I've had my whole life, but why my wife hid that letter is beyond me,' said Trapani after thinking Childress was his. Childress spent his youth in Pennsylvania and described growing up feeling a void because he did not know who his father was. Reunited: Tony Trapani (right) met  61-year-old 'son' Samuel Childress (left) last month thinking that the two were finally together, but paternity results revealed they aren't related . Lost time: Childress' mother wrote Trapani with the news of his alleged son over 50 years ago, but his wife hid the letter (above) As for the letter, written in 1959, it began; 'I have a little boy. He is five years old now. What I'm trying to say Tony is he is your son. He was born November 14th, 1953.' When he never responded, Childress' mother simply assumed the man wanted nothing to do with the boy, and informed the child of his decision. 'I always asked my mom, I said, 'Well what does he look like?'' says Childress. 'She said, 'Well, go look in the mirror.'' Childress may not ever learn who his father is but now he has a father figure he can proudly call his friend.","Tony Trapani, 81, of Grand Rapids, Michigan  discovered a letter written by a woman revealing that she had given birth to a son, and he was the father .
Trapani contacted Samuel Childress, 61, to tell him he was the father and they decided to met and spent a week bonding .
Paternity results from February 2 reveal the men are not related but they have decided to maintain a relationship .
The letter had been sent 56-years ago, but Trapani's wife had his it from him .
Following his wife's death, Trapani found the letter in a filing cabinet, believing his wife hid it as she was unable to have children .

"It is one of the most hotly-anticipated film releases of the year. But it seems the film adaptation of best selling erotic novel Fifty Shades Of Grey was not smooth sailing. The film's director Sam Taylor-Johnson has told of clashing with the book's author EL James over bringing her raunchy books to the big screen. Scroll down for video . Fifty Shades of Grey director Sam Taylor-Johnson admitted that she and author EL James (right) had 'proper barneys' on set over 'creative differences' Sam, 47, here with husband Aaron Taylor-Johnson, 24, says doing the film didn't impact her own love life . The artist-turned-film-maker admitted that she and the best-selling author had a few creative differences . Taylor-Johnson told Porter magazine: 'It was difficult, I'm not going to lie. 'We definitely fought - but they were creative fights and we would resolve them.' She added: 'We would have proper on-set barneys, and I'm not confrontational, but it was about finding a way between the two of us, satisfying her vision of what she'd written as well as my need to visualise this person on screen. But, you know, we got there.' Asked whether she is friends with the author now, she replied: 'Ummm.' When told that she didn't have to answer, Taylor-Johnson replied: 'Good.' Sam Taylor-Johnson appears in the latest issue of Porter magazine which hits newsstands on 6 February . Sam Taylor-Johnson  translated the book (right) to the big screen with Jamie Dornan (left) in the starring role . Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson put on a steamy portrayal as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele . Angelina Jolie's name was previously linked to Fifty Shades Of Grey, with reports that she was preparing to direct the movie. The Hollywood star has previously addressed the rumours, saying that she 'came very clear out of the gate'. Now Taylor-Johnson has told the magazine: 'I got an email out of the blue from her saying good luck on your journey. I thought that was incredibly sweet of her.' And asked whether the steamy scenes in Fifty Shades had any impact on her sex life with younger husband Aaron Taylor-Johnson, 24, she remained coy, saying: 'My intimate life is doing just fine. It didn't need improving.' The raunchy film, which will be released February 13, was rumoured to have Angelina Jolie as director for a while before Sam Taylor-Johnson was announced . Sam Taylor-Johns spoke to Porter magazine . Sam told The Guardian this weekend about one scene in which she disagreed with producers, featuring 'sexual' jellyfish. The director felt that featuring footage of the jellyfish would suggest the sensuality of a scene without showing too much. She said: 'We went to this beautiful aquarium and there were these jellyfish. They're so sexual, jellyfish, when you look at them in tanks – just the way they move, the fluidity. 'So there was a scene when we go into Anastasia's world and her head, and we just had these jellyfish on the screen.' She added: 'It was beautiful, very impressionistic. Everyone went, 'What the f*** are those jellyfish doing there?' 'So we had to take them out. I wasn't happy to let them go.' For the Nowhere Man director, the scene was all about letting viewers' imaginations run wild. 'I didn't want it to be graphically explicit, and I know that's going to be disappointing to some people,' she said. 'It's the build up and titillation of touch and sensuality. So I don't think it goes into the realm of porn.' She explained there were constraints on sexual content because she wanted the film to earn an 'R' rating in the US – meaning it can be viewed by mainstream audiences. Porter, Net-A-Porter's fashion magazine, is on sale globally from 6 February.","Sam admits she and E L James had creative differences .

"In his days as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown roamed the halls of parliament with a stony expression and a sharp tongue. But becoming a husband to Sarah Brown, 51, and a father to their two boys, appears to have softened the man who was once described by Tony Blair as 'The Big Clunking Fist', beyond all recognition. In a new interview with HouseBeautiful magazine, Sarah's mother, Pauline Macaulay, let slip that on Mother's Day, the ex-Prime Minister is likely to join his wife and their two sons for a rare treat of breakfast in bed. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown with his wife Sarah and children Fraser (L) and John (R) in December 2014 during a press conference to announce he is standing down as an MP in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. The close-knit family have transformed Brown from a serious bachelor in the early days of New Labour to a man who enjoys kitchen table suppers . When asked what her plans for Mother's Day were, Sarah revealed that she was hoping to be gifted with a simple homemade meal made by Gordon, 63, and their two boys, John, 11, and Fraser, eight. She said: 'I hope so. Just a bit of toast and a cup of tea and I'm good.' Sarah's mother Pauline added: 'And everyone piling into bed at the same time.' It is a far cry from Brown's bachelor days as a young politician - when New Labour came to power in 1997, he was said to work 18 hours a day, six days a week. His dedication to his work was so strong that an ex-girlfriend, Princess Marguerite of Romania, once described their relationship as 'politics, politics, politics.' Sarah (right) says her mother, former teacher Pauline Macaulay (left), was a role model for her growing up . But even Brown himself now admits that his attitude to to life and work, especially in regards to his two sons, has changed dramatically in recent years. He told the magazine: 'Before I had children I always thought I’d want them to succeed, do well and study hard. 'But when you have your boys, you realise you just want them to be happy.” 'I would add to that – I’d also want them to know and understand what our values are and then take them forward and do things their way.’ Sarah, right, pictured at her childhood home in Dorset with mother Pauline, goes home to 'take stock' When it comes to bringing up her boys, Sarah revealed she also just wants them to be happy. The charity ambassador said: ‘As parents, all Gordon and I can do is share our values with them – but they’ll make their own choices.' For Sarah, she doesn't need to look further than her own upbringing and her mother Pauline  for inspiration. She said: ‘When I was growing up Mum was a strong role model as a feminist, working mum and somebody who had gone back to a career after having children. 'She trained as a teacher, then a headteacher and has a PhD in social anthropology. Whatever glass ceiling exists, my mother’s always pushing it higher. ‘My mum’s home in Dorset has always been a base where I can come and take stock. All the family spent time there last summer. 'When I come and see Mum I do a lot of sleeping and not a lot else!’ At home in Scotland, Sarah and Gordon are keen for their boys, John and Fraser, to enjoy a normal, happy childhood. The couple, who married in 2000, tragically lost their first child, daughter Jennifer, in 2001 when she was just  10 days old. Today, Sarah wants to mirror her own happy memories. 'My home life with Gordon and the boys in Scotland is similar in some ways to my childhood. For a fuller version of this interview see the March issue of House Beautiful, out Feb 4 . 'It’s busy and we all have our own activities, but the heart of my house is the kitchen table, just like Mum’s. 'You never know whom you’re going to find around that table.’ The former PR executive is now in charge of global charity Theirworld which she launched 12 years ago to address the rights of women and children around the world . She’s currently campaigning to ensure that the UN promise to have every child in school by 2016 becomes a reality with her #UpForSchool Campaign, and is working with Gordon to help secure the release of the kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls. She has now taken to social media to promote her charity: ‘I started using social media, including Twitter, to connect with a younger audience during my time at 10 Downing Street,’ she said. ‘My work is to make sure I can use the skills that I have to connect with people and empower them to make a difference too.’ Yesterday, it was revealed that she was joining the a line-up of 17 celebrities for the Great British Comic Relief Bake Off because her family are fans of the series. 'I live in a household of Bake Off lovers. My little boys just adore the programme so they’ve been my greatest fans for me taking part in the show.'

"Pensioners should have to opt in to receive the winter fuel payment, said a think-tank close to David Cameron. Policy Exchange also advocated limiting child benefit to four youngsters per household with scaled down weekly payments after the first. This could save as much as £1billion over the next Parliament, it said. Pensioners should have to opt in to receive the winter fuel payment, said Policy Exchange think-tank . The think-tank added that scrapping automatic entitlement to winter fuel payments – worth up to £300 annually – would save as much as £400million a year. The handout aims to help those unable to heat their home properly but goes to all recipients of the basic state pension. But, Policy Exchange said, just 10 per cent of pensioner households are in fuel poverty. An 'opt-in' system would make it easier for wealthy retirees to decline the benefit. Recipients of pension credit would continue to receive it automatically. Pensioners can cancel their winter fuel payment but few do so as awareness is low. The ideas are in Policy Exchange's welfare manifesto which is being launched tomorrow with David Blunkett, Labour's former Work and Pensions Secretary. An 'opt-in' system would make it easier for wealthy retirees to decline the benefit. Recipients of pension credit would continue to receive it automatically . Steve Hughes, author of the report, said: 'Welfare policy has come a long way in the last five years, but it is still not fit for the 21st century. The system needs to be made simpler, more effective, fairer, more affordable, and should reward contribution. 'Presenting pensioners with a choice to receive their winter fuel payment could lead to hundreds of millions of pounds worth of savings, and is just one way to root out perceived unfairness. 'Other measures to make social security better suit the needs of the individual, that make spending more transparent, and take into account an individual's contributory record should be priorities for the next government.'","Policy Exchange say pensioners should opt in to get winter fuel payment .

"Suspected DUI: Edmond Gulley, 32, was discovered asleep at the wheel at a McDonald's drive-thru with nine children in the back seat . A Kansas dad was arrested for a DUI early on Monday morning after police found him sleeping in an SUV at a McDonald's drive-thru with nine children in the back seat. Edmond Gulley, 32, was allegedly drunk driving with six of his children and three of his nieces and nephews when he fell asleep at the wheel at the McDonald's drive-thru in Wichita. None of the children whose ages ranged from 5 months to 12-years-old were injured. Police responded when a woman called 911 because she saw Gulley sleeping in the car at 12:30am on Monday morning. She called police to check on Gulley's welfare. DailyMail.com spoke with Lt. James Espinoza of the Wichita Police Department who said that Gulley was a, 'extremely uncooperative individual' who refused to be tested for substances when police arrived and was arrested. Gulley did not provide a statement. Gulley was also booked on suspicion of child endangerment but he has not yet been charged. Espinoza said that Gulley's children along with his nieces and nephews were released safely to their mothers. He said that Gulley fathered children with different mothers but wasn't certain how many. The children were released to their mothers. Kansas.com reports that Gulley's license has been revoked several times since 1998. 'We're very fortunate that a citizen took the time to call 911 for not only the children in the vehicle but the driver,' said police Lt. James Espinoza. 'We have some concerns about the welfare of the children,' Espinoza said to DailyMail.com. Espinoza said he couldn't remember the last time he saw so many children in one vehicle with a driver suspected of drinking.

"On Monday night many observers in the UK reported seeing an odd halo of light around the moon. The remarkable phenomenon was captured in stunning images, showing the moon surrounded by a bright ring of light. The spectacle is caused by ice crystals in the atmosphere, specifically when thin cirrus or cirrostratus clouds are present at an altitude of about 20,000 feet (6,100 metres). Pictured is the moon halo over the, Isle of Wight. The moon halo is formed by a high-altitude ice crystal cloud that gathers around the moon . During cold weather these clouds can contain millions of hexagonal ice crystals, and as light from the moon - which is just reflected sunlight - passes through the atmosphere, it refracts in a particular way within the crystals. Specifically, the light refracts at angles no smaller than 22° - sometimes leading the phenomenon to be called a 22° halo - which results in a ring around 44 times larger than the moon itself. Different colours of light are bent at different angles, resulting in the inner edge of the halo being slightly red, and the outer edge having a slightly bluer tint. Here the moon halo is spotted over London. The bright 'star' to the left of the moon in the image is Jupiter, which is making its closest approach to Earth until 2019 at the moment . The light refracts at angles no smaller than 22° in the ice crystals (illustrated) - sometimes leading the phenomenon to be called a 22° halo - which results in a ring around 44 times larger than the moon itself . This photo, taken in Wales, shows the large halo; its radius is roughly the size of an outstretched hand at arms length . Some people online took to Twitter to express their amazement at seeing the moon ring . The phenomenon occurs when the sky is full of thin cirrus or cirrostratus clouds, seen as a thin wisp on the left in an image taken by Jason Hedges, 41 at his home in West Wittering in Sussex. Different colours of light are bent at different amounts, so the inner edge of the halo is slightly red, and the outer edge is slightly more blue, seen on the right above St Catherine's lighthouse, Isle of Wight . The effect was visible to observers across the UK including the Isle of Wight and in Herefordshire . The reason that it forms as a ring is because of the angle of refraction. The only light that reaches your location is that which is located at the right distance away from the moon to form a ring. Here, a vapour trail from a plane is seen cutting through the halo above Herefordshire . The effect is not exclusive to the moon, however. It can also occur around the sun, for the same reasons described above. On some occasions the halos are accompanied by sundogs - bright spots either side of the moon or sun as the crystals sink through the air, causing the light to be vertically aligned. ‘Ice halos are atmospheric phenomena that can occur around the sun or the moon, when tiny crystals of ice in the atmosphere refract and reflect light, creating a halo around the solar or lunar source,’ Ben Biggs, Editor for All About Space magazine, told MailOnline. ‘Visually, they can range from the one we could see [on Monday] night in parts of the UK, which was a cool and slightly creepy perfect circle around the moon, to a bright and ethereal display featuring multiple arcs and 'sundogs' (also known as parhelia), which appear as bright spots at the corners of the halo when the sun is near the horizon.’ ‘Even the more ordinary halos are fairly uncommon in the UK but in particularly bright and bitter conditions, such as in the US, absolutely spectacular ice halo displays can appear.’ Other users on Twitter were not so lucky, with some bemoaning the cloudy conditions that made the effect not visible . Ice halos were once said to be a sign that a storm was approaching, as cirrus or cirrostratus clouds often come before a large storm front. However, the clouds can also occur without a large storm approaching, so their use as an accurate weather prediction tool is not entirely accurate. The images also show the gas giant planet Jupiter near the moon. The planet is due to make its closest approach to Earth until 2019 this Friday 6 February, so it is particularly bright and visible in the night sky at the moment. Known as opposition, the event will see Jupiter come within 404 million miles (650 million kilometers) of Earth. Shown are sundogs apppearing either side of the sun in Fargo, North Dakota . The sight of three suns in the sky is enough to make most of us rub our eyes in disbelief, but centuries ago, the strange sight was seen as a bad omen. The unusual spectacle is called a parhelion or a sundog. It is the result of a  natural phenomenon in which sunlight passes though snow crystals in a particular way when they are suspended in the air. Sundogs are created when sunlight is refracted by large, hexagonal ice crystals, such as those in snowflakes. They typically appear as two coloured patches of light either side of the sun and though rare, can in theory be seen anywhere in the world in any season. They are created by the refraction of light passing through flat, hexagonal ice crystals in high, cold clouds. The crystals act like prisms so that as light passes through them, it is bent  by exactly 22 degrees  before reaching viewers' eyes to make the illusion. If the crystals are more randomly located in clouds, a complete ring around the sun is visible, called a halo. But if the crystals sink through the air, they become arranged in vertical lines, so that the sunlight is refracted horizontally, to make sundogs, as seen in these images. If the phenomenon is seen as the sun is rising, the sundogs gradually move further away from the sun, but always stay at the same elevation, so the three 'orbs' appear to be the same distance from the horizon. They are reddest in colour when they are near to the sun and fade to yellow, orange and then blue as they move away. The colours of sundogs merge into a white halo in some instances.","Observers around the UK snapped images of a 'moon ring' Monday night .
The amazing phenomenon occurs when light from the moon reflects off ice crystals in the atmosphere .
The light refracts at 22° in the ice, so the eye only sees the ring of light around the moon - and not elsewhere .
Different colours also refract differently - so the inside of the ring appears red, and the outside is blue .
The phenomenon is often said to warn of an approaching storm front - although that's not entirely true ."
"For the first time in 17 months, the Reserve Bank of Australia have cut interest rates - taking the cash rate down to 2.25 per cent. The 0.25 per cent cut sees rates hit a record low, and comes after rates remained stable on 2.50 per cent, the longest period of cash rates remaining the same in Australian history, according to the ABC. The rate has not dipped below 2.25 per cent since the RBA started targeting inflation after it gained independence in the 1990s. The rate cut saw the Australian dollar drop from 78.18 US cents to 76.65 just after the announcement at 2.35pm. Scroll down for video . Reserve Bank of Australia have cut interest rates, taking the cash rate down to 2.25 per cent . If the cut is fully passed on it will take the standard variable mortgage rate down to 5.7 per cent, which means repayments on a $400,000 mortgage will drop by $60 a month on average. Treasurer Joe Hockey said the cut to interest rates was good news for business and households. The below figures indicate the loan amount, current monthly repayment and average savings. For example if you have a $100,000 mortgage and currently pay $626.09 per month you will save around $15.16 per month. This assumes 25-year standard variable rate loan at an average new interest rate of 5.7 per cent. 'This is good news for Australian families and it's good news for Australian business,' Mr Hockey said in Canberra. 'The government is working hard to take the pressure off interest rates by keeping inflation low.' Mr Hockey said combined with a fall in petrol prices Australians had received the equivalent of a three-quarter of one per cent cut in interest rates. The treasurer said the Reserve Bank had 'more room to move'. Mr Hockey said the rates decision would lift business and consumer confidence. 'The shackles are off the Australian economy,' he said. 'I say to Australian business ... go out there, have a go, employ more Australians because the costs of doing business are down.' The treasurer said he expected the banks to pass on the cut immediately across the credit spectrum and not just limit it to home loans. An International Monetary Fund report due out within days would show global economic headwinds remain of concern, he said. Treasurer Joe Hockey, pictured on Monday, said the cut to interest rates was good news for business and households . Australian National Retailers' Association (ANRA) CEO Anna McPhee echoed the treasurers sentiments,. 'The retail sector welcomes the sensible approach taken by the RBA today in lowering the cash rate to a new record low,'. 'Recent falls in fuel prices have had a positive impact on household budgets and the RBA's willingness to lower the cash rate and encourage growth will provide important support to consumer confidence. 'The latest sentiment reading suggests consumers need to feel more confident about a range of economic factors before we see further improvements to activity in the retail sector and reap the recurring benefits this delivers to the economy more broadly,' Ms McPhee added.","The Reserve Bank of Australia have cut interest rates by 0.25 per cent .
This will take the cash rate to 2.25 per cent .
The drop is a record low and the rate has not ever dipped below this .
If passed on in full, repayments on a $400,000 mortgage will drop by $60 per month ."
"Conrad Hilton Jr was arrested in Los Angeles on Monday, nearly seven months after 'going insane' on an international flight back in July. The 20-year-old little brother of Paris Hilton created a raucous scene aboard an airplane while flying from London to LA, according to a new report from TMZ. The nephew of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills stars Kyle and Kim Richards allegedly 'screamed and threatened flight attendants' yelling profane statements such as 'I will f**king own anyone on this flight; they are f**king peasants.' Scroll down for video . Arrested: Conrad Hilton, pictured arriving at Los Angeles International Airport in May 2014, was arrested on Monday seven months after causing a loud disturbance abroad an international flight from London to LA . Conrad - who is the grandson of famed hotel billionaire Conrad Hilton Sr - was 'ferociously punching the bulkhead of the plane, ten centimeters from a flight attendant's face' and 'went berserk causing children on the plane to cry.' Witnesses revealed to the gossip site that he was yelling offensive blurbs such as 'If you wanna square up to me bro, then bring it and I will f**king fight you' and 'I will f**king rip through you and kill you.' Also many on the same flight believed Conrad was smoking marijuana as they noticed a 'smell of weed seeping out of the bathroom.' Hilton heir: Conrad's famous siblings include Barron, Nicky and Paris Hilton (pictured at a family dinner in December) Famous parents: He is the youngest child of Kathy and Rick Hilton, chairman and co-founder of Hilton & Hyland real estate brokerage firm (pictured on December 24) Illegal act: The 20-year-old was allegedly smoking marijuana in the bathroom of the plane (pictured on June 7) When Conrad fell asleep, 'the captain authorized crew members to restrain him to his seat for the descent and he was ultimately handcuffed to his seat.' According to a report on TMZ, the young heir checked into rehab soon after landing. This was not the first time, the young hotel heir had caused a disturbance on a plane. Another source told the site: 'Conrad grabbed a flight attendant's shirt and said ""I could get you all fired in five minutes. I know your boss! My father will pay this out. He has done it before. Dad paid $300k last time.' His father, Rick Hilton, has built a commercial real estate empire with his real estate brokerage company Hilton & Hyland and has an estimated net worth of $300m. Daddy pays for his mistakes: Hilton's net worth is approximately $300m with most of his profits coming from high end commercial real estate . Days before his arrest: Rick snapped this photo of Conrad and a female pal in Las Vegas on his Instagram account on Sunday . The Hilton family's attorney, Robert Shapiro confirmed to the gossip site that 'Conrad took a sleeping pill before the flight and wasn't himself.' In documents obtained by TMZ, Conrad 'admitted to taking a sleeping pill before the flight and then bragged that he ""buried"" flight attendants' by telling the crew that he 'could get all of their jobs taken away in less than 30 seconds.' In his client's defense, Shapiro said there are 'numerous news reports and cases of people experiencing adverse effects including aggressive outbursts.' The good child: Paris Hilton was seen leaving Siren Studio in Hollywood, California with her dog Princess Paris Jr on Monday .","Hilton family attorney Robert Shapiro confirmed the 20-year-old 'took a sleeping pill before the flight and wasn't himself'

"Admit it girls - just because you've grown up, it doesn't mean your girlish dreams have faded. I may be a 20-something woman with my own home and career, but in my head I'm still a Disney princess, convinced that a handsome prince is waiting to whisk me away to his castle, where we'll live happily ever after… . So this week I treated myself to a really girly beauty moment – I enlisted the help of pro make-up artist Olivia Newman-Young to create a fun, colourful look inspired by Princess Elsa in the huge Disney movie Frozen. Scroll down for video . This week Binky relives her childhood fantasies as she is made over to look like Queen Elsa from Frozen . Step 1: Shimmering Skin . 'Binky's complexion is naturally quite tanned,' says Olivia. 'So to give her Elsa's icy skin I smoothed on Givenchy Teint Couture Long-Wearing Fluid Foundation in a paler shade than she'd usually use – it's a gorgeous base that leaves your face looking flawlessly smooth and dewy. 'Fix in place with a dusting of loose powder – I swirled on bareMinerals Illuminating Veil, using a big, soft brush.' Step 2: Disney Eyes . Binky was joined by ex-MIC star Olivia Newman-Young to recreate the girly make-up . 'All cartoon characters have huge, wide eyes – which makes Binky the perfect model for our princess,' explains Olivia. 'Defining her brows with Clarins Pro Palette Eyebrow Kit adds emphasis to Binky's big, brown eyes. 'Next, I recreated Elsa's shimmery pink eye make-up, first smoothing a baby pink shade from Dior's 5 Couleurs Eyeshadow Palette in Tutu across her lids and up to her brow bone. 'I then added a pop of colour using Clarins Ombre Minerale Single Eyeshadow in Vibrant Violet to the centre of her lids, merging it into the pale pink. Olivia recreated the wide Disney eyes with a dot of white eyeliner in the corners to make them appear larger . 'A dot of bright white eyeshadow in the inner corners of the eyes is a clever make-up artist's trick for opening up the eyes to achieve that wide-eyed cartoon look. 'I completed the Elsa effect with strong black eyeliner along the upper lash line around the outer corner of the lower lash line, using Daniel Sandler Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet. Finally, I added lashings of Double Perfection Mascara by the brilliant Japanese brand DHC. It lengthens and thickens lashes amazingly well, without clumping or flaking.' Step 3: Winter Glow . To complete the 'Elsa effect' Olivia used thick black eyeliner to make Binky's eyes pop . 'To give Binky the cartoonish effect of ultra-high cheekbones and apple cheeks I used Too Faced Sweethearts Blush in Candy Glow. This shimmery pink powder comes in a wonderful heart-shaped box – just the thing for our girlishly romantic look – and its glistening sheen adds a gorgeous radiance to Binky's skin,' explained Olivia. 'Finally, a slick of tinted lipgloss in a warm berry shade really pulls together all the pinks in this look. I used Clarins Gloss Prodige Lipgloss in Raspberry.' Thanks Olivia – you've made me look as pretty as a princess. Now to find my knight in shining armour!

"An Indiana mother whose daughter took her own life when she was just 14 years old is  fighting to push through a new piece of legislation that would make schools play a bigger role when it comes to bullying. Angel Green was in eighth grade when her mother found her hanged from a tree, leaving behind a suicide note after enduring years of bullying that started with her weight, hair and appearance and took a far darker turn at the end, with students mocking the girl for the years of sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her father. She said in her note; 'It's bullying that killed me. Please get justice.' Words her mother, Danielle Green, still lives by as she continues her fight to make sure schools do everything in their power to monitor harassment and bullying. Angel Green (pictured) was in eighth grade when she took her own life, the result of years of bullying claims her mother . Danielle Green (above) has now made a point to do evertything she can to curb bullying in schools . Green has made this her priority every day since March 5, 2013, when she looked over from a bus stop and realized after a few seconds that the young girl hanging from the tree with a rope around her neck was her daughter. Since then, she drafted a new anti-bullying law that received 150,000 signatures and provided a few major changes in how the state of Indiana would try to curb harassment, with the biggest change being that schools would start being held accountable. Like most young people, girls in particular, Angel was bullied about the same things as most other kids her age starting in about sixth grade, be it her weight or her freckles or her hair. Then, when Angel entered eighth grade, students began mocking her when her father was arrested after years of sexually abusing and molesting her. He plead guilty and is serving out an 18-year sentence. This is why holding schools accountable for harassment is so important to Green, who believes that bullying is what pushed her daughter to suicide. The Tippecanoe School District told NBC News that 'administrators are confident the school made all social and emotional resources, internal and external, available to this child and family.' 'It's bullying that killed me. Please get justice,' wrote Angel in her suicide note . Angel ended her life, her body seen before she had been identified from a bus stop by her mother, hanged from a tree . After the bill found a sponsor and was set to go, Green thought her mission was over, until she got the news that she said 'hit us like a ton of bricks.' There were 307 pages of proposed changes, and one of those changes, which even Green was unaware of, was the removal of the section that made schools accountable for harassment. Dear Mom, . I'm really sorry that I did this. Don't you EVER think it was your fault. Because it's not. I love you so much and I couldn't ask for a better mum. Thank you for caring and feeding and loving me for 14 years. I'm sorry once again. But my heart can't take this pain. I'm gonna miss you so much. I love you. And I can't wait till the day I get to see you again. I'll be waiting at heaven's gates for you. I love you. Goodbye :( . Angelina Green . P.s. It's bullying that killed me. Please get justice. Now Green has started a new petition on Change.org to get the bill stopped until this is put back in and schools are legally required to take an active role, which, despite the extra work, will help curb bullying and suicides. 'My beautiful daughter Angel took her own life after being repeatedly bullied by classmates both in person on school grounds and over the internet,' writes Green on her page. 'The pain of losing a child is indescribable -- she was the light of my life and I still can’t comprehend life without her.' On the other side however is Seamus Boyce, the attorney for the firm who advised undoing those measures, and, as he explains it, this law is already in existence. Bullying, he says, is covered by federal anti-discrimination laws. He also reports  the inexact science of aspects of the bill, such as asking schools to report incidents of bullying, and pointing out that 'some said they had none and some said they had like 400.' As for Green, despite her new fight and the setbacks presented by this unforeseen change, there is one bright side, and that comes with the outpouring of love and support she received when she set up her Change.org page. 'I sat down a little bit ago and started reading some of the comments,' she revealed last week. 'And I just sat here and cried.'

"A toddler pulled a bag of cocaine out of Candyce Hardem's shirt during a traffic stop near Daytona Beach . A toddler pulled a bag of cocaine  out of a woman's shirt during traffic stop. Deputies say an 11-month-old boy pulled a baggie full of cocaine from inside the shirt of Candyce Harden, during a traffic stop near Daytona Beach. Volusia County Sheriff's deputies stopped a car Sunday for traffic violations. The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports a K-9 unit arrived to check the car. Deputies asked the occupants to step outside  - in the back seat was Crystal Matthews and an 11-month boy, investigators said. No drugs were found inside the car, but as the deputy handed a driver's license the baby reached inside her shirt and pulled out the baggie. It is unclear who the baby belongs to. An arrest report says deputies found three more baggies and pills without a prescription. Harden faces multiple charges including child abuse and possession of drugs. Deputies checked Matthews and discovered she was on 'Florida Inmate Release status' for the sale/manufacture/or delivery of cocaine, reports said. It's not known whether Hardem hired a lawyer. Harden was released after posting $4,500 bail, court records show.

"A once gilded Brooklyn movie palace that's been crumbling for decades, with pigeons infesting its stage, is back - again a glittering gem from the 1920s. Diana Ross headlines Tuesday's opening night at the 3,200-seat Kings Theatre in the Flatbush neighborhood where a teenage Barbra Streisand spent afternoons enjoying double-features. After a two-year, $95 million renovation, every detail from its jazz age 1929 incarnation has come to life amid computerized sound and LED lighting. The theater that first opened weeks before the Wall Street crash is now the largest in New York's biggest borough. Scroll down for video . Big and bold: The theater that first opened weeks before the Wall Street crash is now the largest in New York's biggest borough . Ready for action: A once gilded Brooklyn movie palace that's been crumbling for decades, with pigeons infesting its stage, is back - again a glittering gem from the 1920s . Sell-out performance: Diana Ross headlines Tuesday's opening night at the 3,200-seat Kings Theatre in the Flatbush neighborhood where a teenage Barbra Streisand spent afternoons enjoying double-features . Flashback: The ornate venue (seen here in 1929) was one of five Loew's wonder theaters built in New York and New Jersey . 'We don't want to make it look brand new; its character, its patina, is the glow and the warmth and the burnishing of the gold- and the copper-leaf, of the beautiful light fixtures, the seats, the carpet and the fabric - it all blends together so perfectly,' says David Anderson, president and CEO of the Houston, Texas-based ACE Theatrical Group selected to restore and operate the city-owned property. 'And yet,' he added, 'if we can't make it be a piece of successful commerce, we've wasted our time.' In the next few months, programs will feature entertainers from Gladys Knight and Crosby, Stills & Nash to Sarah McLachlan - the first of about 200 live annual events being planned. Gone are the pigeons that left years of droppings inches deep in a space that also served as a refuge for homeless New Yorkers. Balconies that had collapsed onto water- and mold-soaked floors are up again, complete with new red velvet seating. The roof no longer leaks. And the 2,000-pound, Art Deco lobby chandeliers - too heavy for vandals to strip - again exude splendor above the re-polished entrance marble. Dilapidated: By 1977, when the theater was shuttered, suburban multiplexes had replaced the grand, deteriorating inner-city palaces . Intricate interiors: After a two-year, $95 million renovation, every detail from its jazz age 1929 incarnation has come to life amid computerized sound and LED lighting . Crowd-pleasers: In the next few months, programs will feature entertainers from Gladys Knight and Crosby, Stills & Nash to Sarah McLachlan - the first of about 200 live annual events being planned. The carpeting is patterned after the original one that was destroyed - except for a tiny strip discovered under a defunct popcorn machine that served to duplicate the pattern. The theater has a goal that reaches beyond its terra-cotta, ornamental facade: to be an economic engine for a once heavily Jewish neighborhood now home to many Caribbean immigrants. Some are struggling in a community that has survived a roller-coaster of crime and decay on its way to the current real-estate renewal. Most of about 100 jobs at Kings will go to area residents, with local restaurants and small businesses also benefiting. On February 7, Kings will open its doors for free tours. 'We'll be catering to the immediate community, presenting shows that interest New Yorkers from the Caribbean culture,' says Anderson. To accommodate families, ticket prices for some shows will start as low as $15. Finishing touches: A worker refinishes the banister of a staircase in the lobby of the Kings Theater . Regal edge: The 86-year-old venue, its decor inspired by France's Palace of Versailles and the Paris Opera, was one of the five Loew's 'Wonder Theatres' in New York and New Jersey - sumptuous homes to a budding movie culture . Characterful: 'We don't want to make it look brand new; its character, its patina - it all blends together so perfectly,' says David Anderson, president and CEO of the Houston, Texas-based ACE Theatrical Group selected to restore and operate the city-owned property . The 86-year-old venue, its decor inspired by France's Palace of Versailles and the Paris Opera, was one of the five Loew's 'Wonder Theatres' in New York and New Jersey - sumptuous homes to a budding movie culture. By 1977, when the theater was shuttered, suburban multiplexes had replaced the grand, deteriorating inner-city palaces. Kings was acquired by the city in 1983 due to nonpayment of taxes, and it took another two decades to raise the $95 million for the restoration. About half the money came from the city and the state, and the rest from the Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group and the ACE Theatrical Group. Expert craftsmen and designers from across the country worked to restore everything from the high curved ceilings and ornately carved American walnut paneling to mosaics depicting medieval chivalry. Vintage black-and-white photos helped the crew to recreate totally decimated areas. Wall tapestries were so badly damaged that they had to be newly manufactured. But the traditional weaving looms needed could only be found in Portugal. On a snowy New York afternoon a day before the opening, technicians cranked up the music decibel level to test mammoth, $100,000-plus speakers facing the empty auditorium. Industrial vacuum cleaners roared from the stage, sucking up the last construction debris. Kings was ready for Diana Ross.

"Her figure is the envy of women around the world thanks to her slim yet curvaceous shape. And now fans of Beyonce can emulate the very diet that got her there, by going vegan with the star's new food delivery service. The 33-year-old has partnered with her personal trainer Marco Borges to create an on-demand service called 22 Days Nutrition. Scroll down for video . Singer Beyonce has launched a  on-demand vegan delivery service with her trainer Marco Borges that lasts for 22 days . The idea behind the 22 day plan is that it takes 21 days to break your unhealthy eating habits. All of the meals in the plan will be 100 per cent plant-based and delivered once a week, with all ingredients non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free and organic. The prices start as low as $9.24 (£6.15) per meal and you can choose to have one, two or three meals delivered per day. Sample dishes include  curry fried rice with vegetables, almond berry breakfast loaf and fajita breakfast beans. Beyonce said of the plan: 'All you have to do is try. If I can do it, anyone can.' 22 Days nutrition is delivered directly to your door and meals start for as little as $9.24 per dish . Her business partner Borges added: 'We all know the importance and value of eating plant-based foods but often times find ourselves trapped in a series of bad habits that sabotage optimum wellness. 'The Vegan Meal Delivery program makes it easier to reset your habits with healthy and delicious plant-based foods.' Beyonce first decided to try veganism herself at the end of 2013, when she and her husband Jay Z dramatically slimmed down after following the healthy eating plan. Jay posted about the plan on his Life and Times website saying: 'On December 3, one day before my 44th birthday, I will embark on a 22 Days challenge to go completely vegan, or as I prefer to call it, plant-based! When Beyonce went vegan at the end of 2013, she took great delight in sharing photos of the delicious food that she had been eating . He continued: 'This all began a few months back when a good friend and vegan challenged me to embrace a  'plant-based breakfast' every day. 'It was surprisingly easier on me than I thought ... PS: B is also joining me.' Beyonce then posted a series of Instagram pictures detailing some of their meals, which included vegan macaroni cheese. They were also spotted eating out at Vegan restaurant called Crossroads in Los Angeles. Singer Jennifer Lopez is also a fan of the plan and has previously said: 'You do feel better. I do recommend the vegan diet because you wake up and feel great!'. It has previously been reported that vegans are, on average, 10 to 20 pounds lighter than their meat-eating counterparts. Now fans of the singer can emulate the diet that she undertook by signing up the the 22 Days Nutrition plan . FEMAIL spoke to Lifesum nutritionist Lovisa Nilsson, who said that a vegan diet can be good for your health. She said: 'A vegan diet has several health benefits, including lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, which reduces the risk of heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes. 'Plant-based foods are a good source of protein, whilst whole grains, vegetables and legumes are low in fat (especially saturated fat), high in dietary fibre and contain no cholesterol. 'Aside from the abundance of health benefits, a vegan diet is also addressing environmental and ethical concerns which makes the vegan lifestyle even more appealing.' Beyonce and Jay both went on the diet with Jay Z saying that he found it easier than he had expected to . Lovisa cautions that anyone deciding to try out veganism needs to make sure they keep their diet balanced though. She said: 'Eliminating animal products makes it more difficult to keep a well-balanced diet, and vegans often lack essential nutrients, such as vitamins B-12 and D, calcium and omega-3 fatty acids. 'Although many plant-based foods contain protein, such as beans and tofu, it is often not enough; deficiency and iron anaemia is another issue when replacing meat with other products. 'A vegan diet lacks vitamin B-12, which is essential for the function of every cell in our bodies. B-12 can only be found in certain types of algae. 'Embarking on a vegan meal plan is a big change for the body, and as with any diet, education and planning are vital in order to ensure you get a balanced diet of vitamins and nutrition. 'I would also suggest consulting a nutritionist or a doctor to make sure you are suited for this diet and that it is nutritionally wholesome. 'And keep in mind that becoming vegan doesn't automatically make you healthier, and perhaps it is not necessary to make a full-fledged lifestyle change.' A sample menu has been released of what you could be expecting to have delivered should you sign up for Beyonce and Marco's 22 Days vegan meals. Beyonce has launched a vegan on-demand meal service with her trainer Marco Borges. You can sign up to have one, two or three meals a day delivered . DAY 1 .

"Australian journalist Peter Greste took to Twitter to express his sheer joy after being released from an Egyptian prison where he was held for over 400 days. The 49-year-old Al Jazeera and ex-BBC journalist shared a photo of himself on a beach in Cyprus at about 9:30pm Australian time on Tuesday, with his arms thrown in the air and the caption: 'Free in Cyprus! Feels sweet. Peter back online for first time in 400+ days. Special thanks to Mike 4 [sic] nursing twitter'. It was followed by a Tweet that confirmed Greste was on his way home: 'Brother Mike and I due to head home to Australia shortly. Can't wait for the family reunion.' Scroll down for video . Freedom at last: Australian journalist Peter Greste, pictured on a beach in Cyprus on Tuesday, took to Twitter to express his sheer joy at being released from a Cairo Prison . He was released from prison and deported on Sunday after a presidential 'approval'. The official and an Interior Ministry statement said he was released under a new deportation law passed last year . However a shadow of grief continues to underlie even the tweets of Greste, who continues to advocate for the release of his colleagues Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian national Baher Mohamed. 'Special thanks to all who've supported us over the past year. MUST NOT FORGET THOSE STILL IN PRISON @Bahrooz #FreeAJStaff @MFFahmy11… Keep shouting #FreeAJStaff' he wrote. The three men were sentenced to up to 10 years in jail in 2013 after being accused of helping the Muslim Brotherhood, an outlawed terrorist organisation, due to their coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests following the military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi. Just prior to his first tweet in more than a year, a message on his account read: 'This is Mike who has been running Peter's twitter account since his arrest. A truly massive thank you to everyone who joined the campaign. It was followed by a Tweet that confirmed Greste was on his way home and looking forward to seeing his family again . However a shadow of grief continues to underlie even the Tweets of Greste, who continues to advocate for the release of his colleagues Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian national Baher Mohamed . 'Your contribution has been immense. I now gladly pass over the reins to @PeterGreste Freedom in Cypress!!' Greste was released from prison and deported Sunday after a presidential 'approval,' according to an Egyptian prison official and the nation's official news agency. The official and an Interior Ministry statement said he was released under a new deportation law passed last year. Greste also used his first interview since being deported to call on Egypt to release the other detained journalists and reveal the trauma of leaving his colleagues behind in the Cairo prison. The journalist said he didn't truly believe he was being freed until he was seated on a plane bound for Cyprus. 'You spend 400 days in such close proximity with people and you really get to know them very, very well,' the 49-year-old told Al Jazeera in Cyprus on Monday. Just prior to his first tweet in more than a year, these two tweets appeared on his account . Greste appears in a defendants' cage in a courthouse near Tora prison in Cairo, Egypt in May last year. 'So it was a very difficult moment walking out of that prison, saying goodbye to those guys, not knowing how much longer they will have to put up with this.' Greste said even when driving to the airport on Sunday he wondered if his ordeal was really coming to end given there'd been other moments when freedom appeared imminent but was 'snatched away'. 'So I really didn't want to let myself believe it really was happening until I got my backside on a seat on the plane with my brother Mike and we knew, then, that for me at least, this is over.' The Australian said the key to surviving jail had been to stay fit physically, mentally and spiritually. Greste exercised by running, kept mentally fit by studying and remained spiritually strong through meditation. He and his colleagues  were sentenced to up to 10 years in jail in 2013 after being accused of helping the Muslim Brotherhood, an outlawed terrorist organisation, due to their coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests following the military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi . Greste's family (left to right): mother Lois, brother Andrew and father Juris,  in Brisbane following his release . Greste's family gave a press conference after he was released following 400 days in an Egyptian prison . 'It was a way of enforcing a kind of discipline on myself and dealing with each day as it came,' he said. 'Hopefully ... I've come out of it not too damaged.' The award-winning correspondent described his release as a massive step forward. 'I just hope that Egypt keeps going down this path with the others,' he said. 'If it's appropriate for me to be free it's right for all of them to be freed.' Greste wasn't expecting to be released ahead of a scheduled retrial. However while running on Sunday the prison warden called him over and told him to pack his things.

"Some people celebrate the big 4-0 with a big party and others book a thrill-seeking experience like a bungee jump. Melinda Bird is determined to mark forty years on this planet by falling in love. The milestone is already an enormous achievement for the devout Mormon from Utah - after she was born with a rare condition called sacral agenesis, doctors predicted that she wouldn't make it past her first birthday. Scroll down for video . Melinda Bird, 40, from Utah was born with a rare condition called sacral agenesis, which caused her spine to stop growing at the bottom of her rib cage. Doctors told her parents that she wouldn't live past the age of one, but she is now celebrating her 40th birthday . Sacral agenesis is a rare condition that caused Melissa's spine to stop growing at the bottom of her rib cage, leaving the lower part of her body compressed. Doctors predicted she would never sit up or talk, but now 40-year-old Melinda counts quad biking, boating, surfing and shooting among her hobbies. And recently she embarked on her most daunting venture yet when she joined the dating scene. The government admin worker, from Utah, has never been kissed - and hadn't been on a date in twenty years. But now she is taking the Mormon-dating scene by storm in her quest to find love. Doctors predicted that Melinda would never sit up or talk, but she defied the odds and now leads a very active lifestyle . Melinda - who walks on her hands and uses a wheelchair - said: 'My condition means my top half is normal, even though my bottom half stopped growing. 'But I've never let my disability get in the way of enjoying life. I love being active and have a great group of friends. 'The one thing missing in my life is a boyfriend. I'd like to find somebody and fall in love. 'I also think I'm judged for my disability. People assume they'll have to look after me, they don't realise how independent I am.' Melinda's faith also means she is keen to settle down as she can feel like an outcast in the Mormon community because of her single status. But while she is physically capable of having children, she fears that her biological clock is ticking and she is keen to have a family or adopt. Melinda said: 'I was raised in the church so the church is very important to me. It's a big part of my life. 'In a way, you kind of feel left out a little bit if you're not married. 'There has to be a guy out there for me.' Melinda enjoys a range of thrill-seeking hobbies, including quadbiking . Melinda loves to be outdoors and most of her hobbies are tailored around sport . Melinda grew up with her mum Carol, dad Pat and older brother Monty, now 44. She said: 'My parents didn't know I had sacral agenesis before I was born. 'My mum always told me knew something was wrong because the pregnancy was different from when she carried my brother - he moved around a lot more.' Carol and Pat's excitement at the birth gave way to despair when they were told that their baby had the condition - which affects one in 25,000 births - and wouldn't live to be a toddler. But despite the grim prognosis, Melinda exceeded all expectations. She said: 'By the age of three I started shuffling around on my bum to get around, then I learnt to walk on my hands. 'Doctors offered me prosthetic legs, but I didn't want them, I preferred walking on my hands.' Melinda  on a date with a gentleman called Kelly Pack in Salt Lake City, Utah . Melinda enjoyed an active childhood with brother Monty and never noticed any differences between them in terms of what they could do. And as she grew older, she refused to let her disability hold her back, learning to drive and living independently. But Melinda never met that special someone and after the death of her parents in recent years, she started to consider her life and what it meant to be alone. She said: 'I feel like my life is very full. I have a wonderful family that's very supportive, friends, I have a nice home and I live in a beautiful area. 'I think the one big thing that's missing in my life is just that special guy. 'I would like to find somebody and fall in love.' Melinda in front of Brigham City Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah . Melinda started her search by uploading a profile to a dating website, but her quest for Mr Right proved more difficult than she anticipated. She said: 'I think I'm attractive to the opposite sex, I've had people tell me I'm beautiful. Does that translate into wanting to date? No.' Melinda was disappointed that she received no hits on her dating profile but, undeterred, she enlisted the help of Mormon dating professionals. She said: 'I thought maybe there was some areas I needed to improve on in myself and they can do that for me. 'I really think they'll be able to help me find the best me.' Firstly, the matchmakers sent Melinda for a makeover to improve her confidence and catch the eye of a potential suitor. And after a shopping spree, a facial, a new hairstyle and new make-up, Melinda was raring to go on the first date arranged by the matchmakers. Melinda lives an action-packed lifestyle but really wants to settle down with a man and start a family . A string of other dates followed, including a horse and cart ride, a trip to the aquarium, romantic dinners and even an indoor skydiving session. Melinda even appeared on local TV to appeal for men to take her out and travelled 800 miles to a Mormon dating convention in California. And although she still hasn't found that someone special, Melinda is starting to find her stride. She said: 'I think I've got better at dating. I still have my profile online and I've gotten more hits of late. I haven't given up hope that someday it will happen. 'I'm romantic, I want to give all of myself to someone. There has got to be somebody out there for me.' Mormon Half Love is on Wednesday February 4, 10pm on TLC.","Melinda Bird, 40,  was born with a rare condition called sacral agenesis .

"Balanced dangerously on two glass bottles and performing push-ups, nine-year-old Giuliano Stroe shows off his remarkable strength . But the latest stunt by the 'world's strongest boy' has sparked outrage, with critics claiming his father is putting his son at risk of serious injury. Giuliano and his seven-year-old brother Claudiu first hit the headlines when videos showing their intense training regime went viral in 2010. The tiny muscle 'men' have been performing amazing acrobatic feats and lifting weights since they were toddlers. Scroll down for video . Showman: Giuliano Stroe, nine, has been called the 'world's strongest boy' thanks to his remarkable shows of strength . Preparation: Wearing only a pair of blue shorts, Giuliano prepares to show off his latest dangerous stunt - balancing on two green glass bottles . Up and away: The tiny Romanian strongman first lifts his feet off the ground and balances on his hands (left), before lifting himself up into the air thanks to his incredible upper body strength (right) Handstand: The nine-year-old elevates and extends fully in an eye-catching display. His parents have denied forcing him to train for hours and mother Ileana said of her sons: 'They have a natural ability for this, nothing is forced, it is what God intended for them' But the shocking latest photos - posted by their dad Iulian - showing Giuliano balancing on two bottles using only his hands have been criticised as extremely dangerous. The youngster is precariously balanced, and the pictures show that he could easily slip on the bottles which could smash and cause massive injury to his hands and face when he came crashing down. One user wrote: 'And what if the bottle cracks? What chance is there that he wouldn't get a serious injury on the way down?' A Facebook user called Paul Moktan wrote, 'This is idiotic, what if the bottle breaks', while another user called Victor Hammer wrote: 'You are destroying his body! Please, it's not OK for the kid.' On previous videos posted by the father, other uses have accused him of 'child abuse' But the criticism has been ignored by the family, and it is not the first time that the boy has been shown doing risky exercises. In a video posted recently, Giuliano is seen performing 25 push-ups on his hands on a horizontal bar and with his head down. His younger brother Claudio does the same exercise, but only manages to make 12 push-ups. Balance: The youngster is capable of extreme shows of strength and performs push ups while balanced on two glass bottles, which prompted criticism on social media . Dangerous: Giuliano performs push ups on the bottles, causing one social media user to comment: 'This is idiotic, what if the bottle breaks' Giuliano has already broken two world records for 90-degree vertical push-ups and another for holding on to a pole like a human flag. Claudiu soon followed suit, starting at the age of 18 months, and is already performing handstand push-ups on a bar and learning the same terrifying flag trick. Father Iulian, 38, was determined to make them famous and put them through a gruelling two hour regime each morning in Florence, in central Italy, where his family lived. His plans went awry and he was forced back to Romania, where he has now makes a living selling scrap metal and trading in the southern village of Icoana. But he has continued the rigorous training regime, promoting it on the boy's Facebook page which now has more than 3.6 million likes. Training: Giuliani's father Iulian, right, denies pressuring his sons into a gruelling training regime and insists they simply love to train . Dedication: Iulian has trained his sons in their home gyms since an early age, and is capable of lifting heavy weights that many adults would struggle with . Muscle man: Former boxer Iulian (left) has previously said he wants his children to become the strongest in the world . Although local authorities have protested against the father's attitude, they have so far failed to sanction him because they cannot prove he is harming the children. The boys are clearly capable of extraordinary feats, but it has been suggested that it is cruel to expect children of their age to train so hard. But both Iulian and his wife Ileana, 33, defend their training regime for their boy and Ileana said: 'They have a natural ability for this, nothing is forced, it is what God intended for them.'","Giuliano Stroe shot to fame for his dedication to bodybuilding .

"Cannibal killer: Andrew Chimboza who ripped out a man's heart and ate it to 'show he was not gay' has apologised to his victim's family 'for exceeding the boundaries of self-defence, a court heard . A businessman who ripped a man's heart out and ate it to 'prove he was not gay' has apologised to his victim's family for 'exceeding the boundaries of self-defence'. Andrew Chimboza, 35, who runs a window tinting business, pleaded guilty to murdering Mbuyiselo Manona, 62, in the South African township of Gugulethu last year. He told police after he was arrested that he gouged out Mr Manona's heart and ate it as he lay bleeding to death 'to show him that I am not a moffie [gay]'. Appearing in court this week, Chimboza told the judge: 'I am sorry for what I have done and I have genuine remorse. 'I then took a knife and slit his throat and continued to stab him. 'I was so angry that I did not remember how many times I stabbed him or where.' In his plea explanation, Chimboza later claimed Mr Manona attacked him in a jealous rage after accusing him of sleeping with his girlfriend. He then explained he stabbed him and chopped out the man's heart because it was 'full of hatred and jealousy'. He said: 'I do not know why I ate it and I accept my actions were wrong and exceeded the boundaries of self-defence.' Prosecutor Jacqueline Sibiya said: 'Because the removal of the heart was not the cause of death per se, it does not therefore have too much bearing on the plea of murder. 'It is nonetheless very disturbing.' A hearing last year heard that Chimboza flew into a rage after being insulted by Mr Manona while checking on a job he had done at his victim's girlfriend's house. Prosecutor Quawnita Geyer read out Chimboza's statement during the bail hearing at the Athlone Magistrate's Court in Cape Town. He said: 'In your warning statement you say: ""I sit upon him and stabbed him on the chest, tore out his heart and took a knife and then sliced his heart and then I ate his heart. ""The reason for me to eat the unknown guy's heart was to show him that I am not a moffie [gay] and after I finished eating the heart, I realised he was dead.' Chimboza, 35, who runs a window tinting business, pleaded guilty to stabbing Mbuyiselo Manona, 62, in the South African township of Gugulethu (above, file picture) Investigating officer Constable Mphumelelo Yengwa told the hearing that the officer who arrested Chimboza at the scene found him chewing raw flesh and that Manona's neck had been 'half-eaten'. He added that his chest had a gaping hole in the left side. However, Chimboza, originally from Zimbabwe, later disputed the veracity of his statement, arguing that it was fabricated after he was assaulted by the police, according to Sowetanlive.com. The brutal attack took place on the evening of June 10 last year. Chimboza confirmed to the hearing that Manona had called him certain names, that they then fought and that he had stabbed him to death. He said: 'The way I was continuously stabbing, that must have ripped his heart out. Because I was in a shocked state.' Geyer retorted: 'All the witnesses that were there confirm you killed the deceased, you cut out his heart and ate it. 'They say there was flesh in your teeth and dry blood on your mouth.' Chimboza faces life in jail after pleading guilty to murder without premeditation.","Andrew Chimboza stabbed Mbuyiselo Manona in a frenzied attack last year .

"A technology tycoon, his wife and four of their grandchildren died of smoke inhalation and extreme heat in an enormous fire at their opulent mansion in Annapolis. The remains of Don and Sandra Pyle and grandchildren Alexis, eight, Kaitlyn, seven, Charlotte, eight, and Wesley, six, were pulled from the huge Maryland property. It caught fire in the early morning of January 19, and burned for hours after a faulty electrical point set a huge, dry Christmas tree on fire. Scroll down for video . Victims: Aleix Boone, eight, (left) and her sister Kaitlyn, seven, (right), died alongside their cousins and grandparents in the huge fire at a waterfront mansion in Annapolis, Maryland . Killed: Medical examiners concluded all six died of smoke inhalation and thermal injuries. Above are the second sit of siblings, Charlotte Boone, eight (left), and her brother Wesley, six . Mansion burning: An investigation concluded a large, dried-out Christmas tree was at the heart of the intense fire which razed the $9million home . Tech tycoon: Don Pyle and his wife Sandra, pictured, owned the lavish home, which was built in 2005, before sprinkler systems were mandatory . Maryland's Chief Medical Examiner confirmed Tuesday that the deaths of all six were due to 'smoke inhalation and thermal injuries'. Though the four children share a surname - Boone - they were cousins from different branches of the family. Aleix and Kaitlyn were sisters; Charlotte and Wesley were also siblings. Neither set of parents was in the house at the time of the fire. Surviving members of the Pyle and Boone families declined to comment when approached by the Baltimore Sun. Fire chiefs in Annapolis had earlier revealed that the 16,000 square foot home, valued at $9million, was razed to the ground after a dried-out, 15ft Christmas tree caught fire at around 3am. According to investigators, the dried-out tree was cut down 65 days before it caught fire, and had been standing in the so-called Great Room of the house for more than a month. Intense: The blaze, which began in the small hours of 19 January, continued to burn in parts for more than a day . Still going: Investigators are still trying to work out how the fire spread so quickly through the home . Ashes: The above photograph shows the remains of the home, which was devastated by flames . The family was asleep in the house, having just been out to the Medieval Times themed restaurant, when a faulty electrical fitting gave off a spark which set alight the tree, which was surrounded by dry needles. Officials said smoke detectors would have sounded, but that the house had no sprinkler system to fight the blaze, as it was built before they became a legal requirement. It is not clear how much sprinklers would have helped had they been there. The fire department continues to investigate how the fire spread so quickly through the house. Part of the probe, which is being carried out by federal investigators as well as Anne Arundel County's Fire Department, will involve buying similar and drying them out in a bid to recreate the blaze. Asleep: Fire officials said all six victims were sleeping when the house set alight around 3am . Though the families did not speak after the latest information was released, an earlier statement thanked investigators and spoke of their personal sense of loss. It said: 'The brave members of these organizations have faced dangerous conditions and heart-breaking discoveries, but they have repeatedly amazed us with their professionalism, respect for our family, and dedication to their work . 'We believe that life is about making memories. As we work through our pain and loss, the memories we made with our family will sustain us. We ask for continued respect of our need for time and privacy as we struggle to begin healing.'","Don and Sandra Pyle died alongside four grandchildren at Maryland home .

"As a veteran of an Antarctic trek, Prince Harry is no stranger to the cold but while going bare-headed today, the royal seemed to feel the chill. The 30-year-old grabbed a young man's bobble hat and either seemed to be readjusting the item or preparing to take it for himself. It was all part of a visit to Huntingdon Academy in Nottingham to discuss the Full Effect Youth Project in St. Ann's. Scroll down for video . Prince Harry plays fashion guru as he adjusts the hat of Demani Cowin-Jenkins as EPIC worker Mick Dawber watches during his visit to the Full Effect Youth Project  in St. Ann's, Nottingham . Harry seemed happy to pose for a snap by one of the children who have been working on a film based on the real-life experiences of young people . But Demani Cowin-Jenkins, who was wearing the blue and white-striped headgear wasn't distracted from showing the prince and Mick Dawber, a worker with EPIC, a partnership of headteachers and youth workers, a bicycle tyre he was working on in the school's bike repair shop. Prince Harry laughed and joked his way through the visit to discuss the programme which works with young people and and children from primary schools in St Ann's to deter them from becoming involved in youth violence and gang-related crime. He  met the stars and creators of a new film, Guillemot, based on the real-life experiences of young people and filmed in Nottingham's  St Ann's area. The film, which is Full Effect's first completed project, began filming in April 2014 and will premiere in early 2015. Dressed casually in a grey fleece over a pale blue shirt with jeans and brown suede desert boots, the royal chatted to the young actors, producers and scriptwriters at the school before heading off for the premiere at the city's Cornerhouse Cinema. Prince Harry visited the school's eco-garden which includes a greenhouse made out of plastic bottles, a bicycle repair workshop and football coaching. Dressed casually, the cheeky looking Prince chatted to the young actors, producers and scripwriters . Harry talked to Nottingham youngsters involved in a range of after-school activities . Many of the teenagers who spoke to Harry said they had met him before on one of his two previous visits and one joked he was becoming a 'regular visitor' to the area. The Prince also watched a game of football, but decided not to take part in the kickabout. The Full Effect project is a community initiative in St Ann's aimed at tackling problems including youth violence and gangs, as well as improving opportunities for the young people involved. It aims to train young people to be fully qualified youth leaders and provides extra-curricular activities to primary school children. It's supported by the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Harry seemed in great spirits as he chatted with the children involved in the Full Effect Youth Project, which is supported by the Royal Foundation, as they showed him round their eco-garden . Headteacher Teres Shrestha told the Nottingham Post: 'I'm absolutely thrilled he's come to meet our children. 'It's really important that he supports and believes in our community here – it's something really positive.' 'We talked about how important it is to develop positive role models for future generations and he was really interested. 'The kids didn't know he was coming here and only found out when they met him so it was a nice surprise. 'It's great for them to share their work with a member of the Royal Family.' It was Prince Harry's second official engagement of the year after he kicked off his royal calendar with a trip to Twickenham Rugby Stadium to meet marathon runners raising money for his charities.","Prince Harry made third visit to the Full Effect Youth Project in Nottingham .

"There has been a lot of media focus on cancer recently – with latest research suggesting the disease is down to bad luck rather than lifestyle. In actual fact, the study author was quick to point out that lifestyle still has a significant role to play in many cancers. Personally, I believe that the better we look after ourselves, the luckier we get! Breast cancer is a good example. There is no doubt that breast cancer can run in the family. If you have the bad luck to inherit the genes that make you more likely to get breast cancer, there is not much you can do about it. Scroll down for videos . A recent study by scientists at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine suggested some cancers are more down to bad luck than a person's lifestyle. Dr Sally Norton told MailOnline that breast cancer (illustrated) is a good example of how lifestyle can have a big impact on the disease . In some cases those genes mean such a high risk of cancer that women choose to have mastectomies to avoid developing cancer later on, think Angelina Jolie. In other cases, your genes may only increase your risk slightly, but how you live your life also plays a part. So, with that in mind, I have put together some of the questions I am often asked about breast cancer. See how much you know about breast cancer risk and how you can reduce your chances of problems in the future… . Q: How much breast cancer is down to your genes? A: Only three in 100 cancers are due to definite gene problems – but having a close relative such as a mother or sister with breast cancer can double your risk. If you have a lot of relatives with breast (or bowel) cancer, particularly at a young age, it is especially important to mention this to your doctor, as it may be worthwhile getting your genetic risk assessed. Q: How many women get breast cancer? A: One in eight. It’s the commonest form of cancer in women, and though most people are post-menopausal when they develop it, about a fifth of breast cancer sufferers are under 50. Dr Norton outlines some of the questions patients regularly ask her about breast cancer . Q: If you have a breast lump, how likely is it to be cancer? A: It’s unlikely, I’m pleased to say. Breast lumps can be due to many things – general lumpiness around period time, cysts, infection or benign lumps called fibroadenomas. These lumps can get quite large and may, or may not be tender. Benign breast lumps can be removed if necessary, but may often improve with little, if any treatment. However, any lump should be checked out by your doctor – particularly if it is hard and irregular, doesn’t improve after your period, causes puckering of the skin or is associated with changes in the nipple. Q: When are you eligible for breast cancer screening? A: In the UK, it’s between 50 and 70, but is being extended to cover women from 47 to 73. You can still ask to be screened after this age however. Mammograms are X-rays that are frequently used to detect tiny abnormalities in breasts but are less good at finding problems in dense breasts. Ultrasound or MRI scans may also be used. Q: How often should I check my breasts? A: Once a month. It is good to get into a regular habit and monthly checks mean that you will get to know what is normal for you so will be more confident in spotting any changes. Avoid the time around a period when your breasts are naturally more lumpy. There are many guides on self-checking – but soapy hands in the shower are good for detecting lumps. A check in front of a mirror with hands raised above your head and then on hips can also help identify skin changes. One in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer (pictured under a microscope) Dr Norton told MailOnline. It is the most common form of the disease in women, she added . Q: Does being overweight increase the risk of breast cancer? A: Yes. Fat isn’t just stuff that spills over your waistband and sends your weighing scales in the wrong direction – it is an organ of the body that produces chemical messengers (hormones), one of which is oestrogen. Oestrogen is thought to be a major part of the pathway leading to breast cancer so it follows that the more overweight you are, the greater your risk of breast cancer. 1. Touch . Can you feel a lump, either in the breast, upper chest or armpits? Is there a lumpy area, or an unusual thickening of the breast tissue that doesn't go away? Is there any unusual pain, either in the breast or armpit? 2. Look . Any change in size or shape? Any change in skin texture? Such as puckering or dimpling . Any change in colour? The breast may look red or inflamed . What about the appearance or direction of the nipple? Any unusual discharge? Any rash or crusting? 3. Check . Is there anything unusual? If so, get it checked out by your doctor as soon as possible. Source: Breakthrough Breast Cancer . However, being overweight can also decrease the number of periods you have (which decreases the amount of oestrogen released from the ovaries). This may explain the paradox that being overweight can actually decrease the risk of breast cancer before the menopause, but increases it after the menopause when fat is a more important source of oestrogen than the ovaries. Q: How about alcohol and smoking? A: Yes, sorry. Along with cutting down on food, we need to address all aspects of our lifestyle if we want to reduce our risk. We know that smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer – but it can increase the risk of many other cancers too, including breast, cervix, stomach, mouth, bladder and ovary. Too much alcohol – even just a little bit over recommended limits - has also been linked with breast cancer. Just one extra unit per day can raise the risk by around 10 per cent. Q: Does HRT increase the risk of breast cancer? A: Sadly, yes. Which means there is a downside to trying to reduce those hot flushes and other unwelcome consequences of the menopause. HRT contains the hormone oestrogen, and sometimes progesterone too, which can increase the risk of breast cancer. Probably about four in 100 breast cancers can be linked to HRT, mainly those that contain both of the hormones. However, there is some (though limited) evidence that HRT can protect against other diseases such as osteoporosis and can certainly make the menopause bearable for women with severe symptoms – so whether or not to use it is a discussion worth having with your doctor. Women are encouraged to check their own breasts for any changes each month . Q: Do deodorants cause breast cancer? A: We don’t know for certain, is the short answer. Some studies have suggested that there may be an increased risk due to the use of aluminium compounds in antiperspirants. These compounds temporarily block sweat glands – but can build up in breast tissue and produce some oestrogen-like effects. As we know, oestrogen can promote breast cancer growth and so there is a possible link. In contrast, other studies have not shown any increased risk. If the risk was very high, we would know about it by now so we shouldn’t be too alarmed. However, the increasing use of chemical products on ourselves, around the home and in our wider environment, is almost certainly causing some harmful effects and we should try to reduce them wherever possible. Q: Do underwired bras cause breast cancer? A: No. This is a myth that has been started and perpetuated by some poor scientific studies that have since been robustly proven wrong. The theory was that over-tight bras could reduce the lymph drainage from the breast and therefore cause an accumulation of toxins that could then lead to cancer. There is no proof whatsoever that this occurs. Conceivably, a wire rubbing against an already present breast lump could make you aware of it, hence the concern that the pressure may have caused it in the first place. But fear not, it’s just coincidence, so you don’t need to rush out and burn your bra. Getting a good bra fitting is worthwhile, though. Many women are wearing the wrong size and a well-fitted bra can give you an instant boost in body confidence, and take pressure off the shoulders for those with a heavier chest. In the UK women aged between 50 and 70 are eligible for breast cancer screening. There are plans to extend the programme to cover women aged between 47 and 73 . Q: How common is breast cancer in men? A: It’s rare. Only about 400 men a year get breast cancer – not surprising as they have very little breast tissue compared to women. The bad news is that it is more likely to have spread by the time it is picked up…probably because there is less awareness. It is more common in older men (over 60), men who have a family history of breast cancer, or men who are obese, so those man-boobs need tackling now. Gynaecomastia is enlarged breast tissue (as opposed to just fat) that can appear as a lump behind the nipple but is non-cancerous and can be removed if needed. The message is that men need to be aware of breast lumps too and check them out with a doctor straight away. Though breast cancer is common, and may be down to bad genes, there are things that you can do to reduce your risk…or to ensure you pick it up early. Nearly all cancers can be treated – but the earlier they are detected, the greater the chance of success. Treatment options have improved significantly over the past few decades – and now almost eight in 10 women diagnosed with breast cancer will still be alive 10 years later. So, don’t leave it purely to chance – there is a lot you can do to improve your luck.","Breast cancer does run in the family - if your mother or sister is diagnosed your risk of developing the disease doubles .

"A court in Norway has  banished a convicted 'hate preacher' to a remote village after ignoring his lawyer's claims that he had a right to a family life. Police have been given the green light to exile Mullah Krekar to a refugee centre in a village of 2,500 people situated 300 miles from the capital Oslo. The mullah, 58, who has been living in Norway since 1991, founded the radical Islamist group Ansar al-Islam. A court in Norway has banished convicted 'hate preacher' Mullah Krekar (pictured) to a remote village after ignoring his lawyer's claims he had a right to a family life . He was released from prison at the end of January after serving a two-year, 10-month sentence for making threats against Prime Minister Erna Solberg, before she came to office, and three Kurds. The police had invoked special measures to order Krekar, whose real name is Najmeddine Faraj Ahmad, to live in a refugee unit in the remote community of Kyrksaeteroera. The defence had argued that the court needed to examine the legality of the decision, which prohibits the married father of four from leaving the village and which requires him to report to local police three times a week. 'With some misgivings, the court considers that the basic national interest, at least until 31 December 2015, must take precedence over Faraj's right to a family life, freedom to move freely throughout the country and to choose his own place of residence,' read the court's decision. The mullah, 58, who has been living in Norway since 1991, founded the radical Islamist group Ansar al-Islam . Police have been given the green light to exile Iraqi Kurd Mullah Krekar to a refugee centre in a village of 2,500 people situated 300 miles from the capital Oslo (pictured) Krekar's lawyer, Brynjar Meling, appealed the decision and asked that it be suspended pending review. Krekar has been living under risk of deportation since 2003 after Norwegian authorities ordered him to be expelled, claiming he posed a threat to national security. While Norway's court system has upheld the ruling, Norwegian law bars him from being deported to Iraq, where he risks the death penalty. While Krekar acknowledges having co-founded Ansar al-Islam, he insists he has not led the group since 2002. The preacher and the group Ansar al-Islam figure on United Nations and U.S. lists of terrorist groups or individuals.","Mullah Krekar banished to village 300 miles away from Norway's capital .

"A 26-year-old Boro Taxi driver was arraigned Tuesday on rape and robbery charges after it emerged that the suspect had allegedly told police the sex was consensual. Esa Alusaimi was taken into custody early Monday morning for allegedly raping a 33-year-old woman in the back of his green outer borough cab. Alusaimi was ordered held on $100,000 bail after being charged with first-degree rape and criminal sex act, sexual misconduct, unlawful imprisonment, petit larceny and sexual abuse. According to the alleged victim, who is not being named due to the nature of the crime, her nightmare began late Sunday night when she called a car service to pick her up from a friend's house to take her home, but the livery cab did not show up on time. Taxi driver: Green cab driver Esa Alusaimi, 26 (left and right) has been arrested and charged with rape and criminal sexual act in an assault on his female passenger . Dangerous ride: A 33-year-old Brooklyn woman got into the back of a green Boro Taxi Sunday night asking the driver to take her home. Instead, she was left stranded in the middle of the street after being raped and robbed . After waiting for 15 minutes, the 33-year-old saw a green Boro Taxi pull up and the driver asked if she needed to go somewhere. 'I thought everything was normal, got in, told him where I was going,' the woman told the New York Daily News in an exclusive interview. For the passenger, the first red flag went up when she tried to swipe her credit card but was told by Alusaimi his machine was out of service. Laundry list of charges: Alusaimi was ordered held on $100,000 bail after being charged with first-degree rape and criminal sex act, sexual misconduct, unlawful imprisonment, petit larceny and sexual abuse . The woman told the cabbie she had $20 in cash on her, which he said would be enough to cover the fare. The second red flag was when the driver started to ask her personal questions. The woman, however, became alarmed when out of nowhere Alusaimi turned the conversation to his penis. A moment later, the green cab pulled over on a deserted street and the 26-year-old allegedly turned to the woman in the backseat and informed her the doors were locked. According to the 33-year-old, Esa Alusaimi then climbed into the backseat, 'violently' forced her to perform oral sex on him and then raped her. The passenger, who is a lesbian, said the experience was especially traumatic because she had not been with a man in over a decade. Following the assault, the driver calmly got back behind the wheel and drove off. The passenger asked him to take her home, but instead Alusaimi pulled over, told her to get out of the car and handed her $10 asking her to buy him a pack of cigarettes. The woman complied thinking she could run away, unaware that her bag was still in the back of the cab. By the time she realized what was happening, Alusaimi was gone, along with her personal belongings, leaving his alleged victim stranded in the middle of the street. The 33-year-old, however, still had her phone with her and was able to call 911 at the urging of a friend, with whom she had been exchanging text messages. What the woman did not know was that police had pulled over Alusaimi in Carol Gardens for running a red light. An NYPD spokeswoman told the Daily Mail Tuesday that Esa Alusaimi was stopped at around 12.50am at the corner of Hicks and Unions streets for committing a traffic violation. The arresting officer noticed the 26-year-old cabbie was acting 'nervous' and questioned him. Tall tale: When Alusaimi was picked up by police for running a red light, he tried to talk his way out of the situation by saying that he was in a hurry to return a passenger's property to the 76th Precinct . Alusaimi said he ran the red light because he was in a hurry to bring property belonging to a passenger to the nearby 76th Precinct. However, police soon discovered that Alusaimi matched the description of a suspect in a robbery and a criminal sexual act. Meanwhile, the 33-year-old victim was taken to Kings County Hospital for an evaluation before being taken to the precinct, where she was able to pick out her suspected attacker from a police lineup. During questioning about the alleged rape, Alusaimi reportedly claimed, 'she wanted it.' He then described in graphic detail his sexual encounter with the passenger. Speaking to the paper Tuesday, the 33-year-old victim was outraged by her alleged attacker's allegations, which she dismissed as a 'cliche' rape defense, adding that she felt sick to her stomach. Her hope is that the green Boro Taxis, first introduced in 2013 to serve the outer boroughs and Manhattan north of East 96th and West 110th streets, will follow the example of yellow cabs and come equipped with a glass partition separating the driver from the passenger.","Boro Taxi driver Esa Alusaimi, 26, charged with first-degree rape and criminal sexual act .

"A church deacon sued his pastor wife for unfair dismissal after claiming she sacked him when their marriage broke down. Allan Lavington, 62, has been accused of trying to 'pull a fast one' after he lost a tribunal battle with Pastor Deborah Harrison, who runs a church and Christian-based college centre in Birmingham. Mr Lavington demanded £1,000 each for music and flower arranging lessons he claimed he gave for her college centre - but the tribunal ruled he was just a volunteer. Despite the ruling, Mr Lavington said he felt 'robbed' and has vowed to continue legal action against his 58-year-old estranged wife. Centre: The church building in Birmingham where Ms Harrison has run a Pentecostal church for four years . Ms Harrison was accused of unfairly dismissing Mr Lavington from her college centre, the Gospel Express Academy in Birmingham, after they split in 2010. According to one website the centre gives college-level lessons in performing arts, counselling, 'equality and diversity' and 'Christian studies'. Mr Lavington told an employment tribunal he had not been paid for lessons he gave in music and flower arranging at the centre in Handsworth, northern Birmingham. But she claimed the former deacon had only been a volunteer. The employment tribunal ruled in Ms Harrison's favour after agreeing Mr Lavington had insufficient evidence to pursue his claim. Judge Leslie Antis ruled there was no evidence Mr Lavington was employed by Gospel Express Academy. Although they are not divorced, the couple from Birmingham split shortly after their own wedding reception, falling out over several issues including a missing titanium cooking pot. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Lavington - who had also preached at his estranged wife's church - vowed to keep pursuing her through his solicitors. He said: 'She is erratic and fiery tempered - all I want is to do things to please God and do God's will. 'She has no control over money, no idea about paying bills or anything. She knew I had run my own business and could look after those kind of things. 'Those lessons I gave for her cost £1,000 each. How can she say that I would volunteer to do that and close my own business rather than take a cut? 'I could have done it myself and kept all of it, instead she claims I was willing to do it for just the petrol money. 'I don't preach at the church anymore, I'm a Christian first, I don't bother with titles. 'I'm not bitter, but if I saw her walking down the street, I'd blank her. 'My solicitors will be following this up. I can just now be happy that I can go to God knowing I told the truth. Accusations: Ms Harrison, who founded her Pentecostal church Ecclesia Ministries and hosts meetings at Birmingham's Ladywood Methodist Church (above), claimed her husband was 'manipulative and controlling' 'How she has the cheek to get up on the altar now, knowing what she has done, is beyond me. I trusted her as a pastor and I was sucked in by that. That is what I'm ashamed of.' But Ms Harrison, who founded her Pentecostal church Ecclesia Ministries four years ago, claimed her husband was 'manipulative and controlling'. She said four months after the wedding she packed her bags and left, unable to put up with his behaviour. 'I'm well out of it,' she said. 'His bombastic attitude vexed choir members. In the end it got very bitter. 'He wanted £74,000 from me - that's £1,200 a month from 2010 to now. He needs to realise that 60 per cent of nothing is nothing. 'He's been pleading ""Can I come back?"" 'I know he's trying to pull a fast one.

"A seven-year-old boy who asked Santa for a new heart is recovering after receiving a life-saving transplant. Micah Muller, from Waynesburg, Ohio, was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a rare condition that affects blood flow to the heart. After complications last September, he was admitted to the hospital and put on the heart transplant waiting list a month later. Micah, who wasn't expected to live through the New Year, received a new heart on December 20 - just in time for Christmas. Scroll down for video . Gift of life: Micah Muller asked Santa for a new heart and received a life-saving organ transplant just five days before Christmas . 'It's amazing,' Micah's mother LaVonne Dougherty told  Fox 8 News Cleveland. 'It's surreal. Never though that we would be here. Never thought it.' One of the doctors at the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital said Micah had been dying after 'a lifetime of being sick' prior to the surgery. Ms Dougherty admitted that she struggled with her emotions when her son was put on the heart transplant waiting list.

Amazing recovery: Micah, who is pictured with his sisters Cassie (left) Julie (center) and Madeline (right), now has a normal heart after being born with a rare birth defect . 'Just the idea of: “Okay. Am I wishing for another child to die - you know another family's worst tragedy - to save my own?”' she said. 'Psychologically it could do a number for you.' Now Micah's goal is to go home with his mom and play with his three older sisters, Cassie, Madeline and Julie. Micah, who has been fighting for his life since the day he was born, had his first surgery when he was one week old. He faced another soon after, and by the time he was five months old, he had endured a total of three surgeries.

"A lesbian couple who found themselves seated near an anti-LGBT politician on an airplane in Russia staged a loving protest in front of him. The pair posed for a selfie while kissing in front of Vitaly Milonov, who was seated on the row behind them on an domestic flight from Moscow to St Petersburg. The loving protest infuriated the St. Petersburg city councilman, who later called the women 'animals' and threatened to 'call the Cossacks' on them. Loving protest: Instagram user Kseniya Infinity, left, kisses a friend on a flight in Russia, in a protest against anti-LGBT politician Vitaly Milonov sat in the row behind them . The photographer, who goes by the name Kseniya Infinity, said Milonov, famous for attacking the LGBT community, hid behind his tablet. The kissing selfies, posted by Kseniya Infinity on her Instagram and VKontakte, has since gone viral in Russia and started to spread around the globe. Vitaly Milonov is well-known for his discriminating anti-LGBT stance, and threatened openly gay athletes and visitors with arrest ahead of the 2014 Sochi Olympics. After the lesbian kissing selfie went viral, Milonov confirmed the incident to a local news website and threatened to find the women and have Cossacks 'whip and torch' them. 'This animal offended all the passengers on the plane with its extravagant, terrible, inhuman antics,' he said according to Zaks.ru, as reported by Buzzfeed. Success: The kissing selfies, posted by Kseniya Infinity on her Instagram and VKontakte, has since gone viral . Anger: The selfies did not please Milonov, who hid behind his tablet, and later told a local newspaper that he would  'call the Cossacks' on the two women . 'I can call the Cossacks … they're already on their way, with whips and torches. We will expel all the perverts from St. Petersburg.' Last year he said  Apple CEO Tim Cook 'should be banned' from entering Russia after he came out as gay for the first time. Milonov reportedly suggested that Cook could bring 'the Ebola virus, Aids or gonorrhoea',and wanted to ban him from Russia 'for life'. In the past he has also called Stephen Fry 'a sick person', during an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, during which he also likened homosexuality to beastiality. Speaking to a local paper, Milonov called the women's kissing 'extravagant, terrible, inhuman antics' and referred to Kseniya Infinity as 'this animal' In December last year he staged a raid on a St Petersburg gay club where he entered the venue with riot police and arrested anyone under 18. Following last year's Eurovision Song Contest, which he branded a 'Europe-wide gay parade', Milonov tweeted that Russia should boycott the 'Sodom show'. Milonov co-sponsored Russia's controversial 'gay propaganda' law bans displays of 'non-traditional sexual behaviour' in public or in front of under-18s. The law allows the government to detain 'homosexual or sympathetic foreigners' for up to 14 days, after which they could face expulsion from the country.","Two women kiss in front of  Russian anti-LGBT politician on flight .

"Surfing was virtually non-existent in Iran when Easkey Britton first traveled to the 'ultra-conservative' country in 2010. The Irish surfer expected to face anger and disapproval in the Muslim nation where televising female sports is forbidden. Just last year,  a woman was jailed simply for watching a men's volleyball match. But the 29-year-old was shocked to discover a welcoming country as eager to learn the sport as she was to teach them. Overwhelmed by the reaction she returned three years later with filmmaker Marion Poizeau and two female Iranian athletes - professional snowboarder Mona Seraji and diver Shahla Yasini. Marion's documentary 'Into the Sea' charts their incredible journey to the shores of Baluchistan, an area considered so deadly 'even Iranians don't go there'. Scroll down for video . First lesson: Easkey Britton (centre) teaches professional snowboarder Mona Seraji (left) and diver Shahla Yasini (right) how to surf . Acceptance: Men, women and children gathered on Baluchistan's beach to watch Easkey (centre) surf . Letting go: The director of 'Into the Sea' Marion Poizeau told MailOnline: 'A lot of them (children) were very shy at first, but by the time we got into the water, that was gone' Baby steps: Professional surfer Easkey (right) believes young Baluchi girls like this 'are no longer on the sidelines' Making waves: One of Easkey's students Shahla Yasini (pictures) prepares for another ride in Baluchistan . Eager to learn: Easkey (right) teaches a group of young Baluchi boys about surfing as professional snowboarder Mona (left) translates . Champion: Easkey Britton (pictured) was introduced to surfing by her father at the tender age of four and won the Irish National Surfing Championships four consecutive times by 2008 . Marion told MailOnline: 'In Tehran, people were saying you're crazy to go to Baluchistan because it's considered a very dangerous place. 'So when I screened my film in the capital, people were saying we didn't know you could go to Baluchistan and come back alive.' Despite its fearsome reputation as a site of brutal secular fighting between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, there is little alternative to the region's 60-mile stretch of sand and five foot waves. For the country's surf-obsessed, it is becoming a necessary pilgrimage. A large crowd began to gather during Mona and Shahla's first lesson under Easkey's expert guidance. They predicted some opposition in the remote section of a largely male-dominated country, but the locals in Chabahar were simply intrigued. Women are allowed to wear bathing suits in Iran's female-only swimming pools and baths, but traditional head-coverings are mandatory on public beaches where men are present. Hundreds stormed the beach to watch the three women riding the waves in their wet-suits and hijabs. And soon the Baluchi locals were begging to take part themselves. The growth of the sport means 'Baluchi girls and women are no longer on the sidelines' according to Easkey, a five-time national champion in her native Ireland. She added: 'Fathers are asking me to take their daughters surfing. 'What is most inspiring is the enthusiasm and vision of young people here, with the young women playing an important change-making role, leading the way in a new frontier sport, writing a new narrative full of possibility despite being ignored by the world outside and limited by the constraints of their own country.' Parting gift: Easkey (pictured) presented her surfboard to local lawmaker Yaqoub Jadgal, who said: 'It (sport) is not just for men, women can do sports too with the hijab and female instructors' Causing a stir: Hundreds of local Baluchi people gathered for a surfing lesson from Easkey Britton . Leading the way: Easkey Britton (pictured) said: 'What is most inspiring is the enthusiasm and vision of young people here' Going pro: Diver Shahla Yasini rides a wave on the beach in Baluchistan, considered one of the most dangerous places in Iran . Iranian hospitality: Easkey Britton (top right) and her two students Mona Seraji (centre) and diver Shahla Yasini (left) were invited to dine with a local Baluchi family . But her first surf with Mona and Shahla caused quite a stir and when the village elders and a 'powerful' member of parliament requested to meet them Easkey expected the worst. She was again overwhelmed by the tolerance shown by Yaqoub Jadgal, who said: 'Islam recommends sports, which are beneficial both physically and spiritually. It is not just for men, women can do sports too with the hijab and female instructors. 'We will ask female instructors to teach women this sport so they can benefit from this art.' The 'thumbs up' from the community's senior figures mirrored the government's acceptance when they allowed for Marion's film to be screened at the Tehran Film Festival last year. It had such a wide-reaching impact she's now involved in a bid to launch the country's first female surfing federation. She said: 'Hopefully we can organise an international event in the future and convince more Iranians to come with us... but we don't know when it's going to happen because the administration is tricky.' The sport's growing popularity has surprised Easkey, who 'never could have imagined' a religiously devout nation could adopt such a progressive sport into their hearts. Big hit: Marion's film 'Into the Sea' (pictured) was screened at the Tehran Documentary Festival last year . Change: The film was received wonderfully by critics after being screened in a country where even televising female sports is forbidden . She says during 'Into the Sea': 'I came here three years ago and there was nobody surfing and now look at it. More and more people are on the beach every day - boys, girls, everyone joining in. 'People say surfing is a selfish pursuit, it becomes kind of like an addiction and all you care about is finding the next perfect wave, but I really don't believe that anymore. 'I think the most powerful thing about surfing is being able to share that passion and connecting people. This is unbelievable.' Marion added: 'It was very exciting the last day, half the village came to watch the girls surf and the kids were very enthusiastic. 'A lot of them were very shy at first, but by the time we got into the water, that was gone. 'It really breaks down the barriers when we go into the water, it's totally different from the beach. It makes people forget about the rules.' Inspired by their own success, Easkey and Marion also set up the non-profit organisationWaves of Freedom. In its own words, the charity 'uses surfing as a medium for empowerment, transforming the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society, especially women and girls'. Through their first project Surf Seeds, they are trying to establish surfing in Baluchistan through the donation of equipment, formal lessons and workshops on how to build and create surfboards. The two women also created the 'We Surf in Iran' group within the local community in Baluchistan. Now, Iranians travel from all over the country to get lessons in the region they were once afraid of.

"Looks like butter wouldn't melt in this adorable mutt's mouth. But is this pooch  responsible for ripping up a whole box of tissues on the floor of its owner's living room? Keen to find out which of his two dogs wasted an entire box of tissues, a bemused owner says: 'OK, which one of you made the mess with this paper? Who did this? Who tore up the Kleenex?' But whichever mischievous dog committed the crime, it seems the owner might have trouble finding out - and poker-faced pooch Gnarly seems to be keeping schtum. Poker-faced Gnarly is keeping quiet about a pile of ripped up tissues strewn over the living room floor . At first, it looks like Gnarly is the troublemaker. Looking down from the sofa at the damage on the floor, it seems he might not get off the hook easily. Is that a hint of guilt in his eyes? His owner asks: 'Gnarly...did you do that? Did you do this right here?' But before he receives a telling-off, the camera pans round and all is revealed - Gnarly's friend Casey hasn't done a very good job of covering his tracks. He's standing, facing the wall, with a box of Kleenex stuck on his head. Maybe he's thinking if he can't see anyone, no one can see him? As he looks at the scene of the crime, Gnarly the pooch doesn't seem like a particularly innocent party . Looks like someone had a lot of fun with a slipper, a box of ripped up tissues and what appears to be a disembodied plastic frog - all strewn across the carpet at the scene of the crime . Casey is the culprit - padding around bewildered with a key piece of evidence on his head. Case closed! But Casey has been well and truly rumbled, as the key piece of evidence is stuck on his head. As Casey hangs his head, and the tissue box, in shame, his owner says: 'Casey, did you do that? I think you did...' Luckily for Casey, his owner puts him out of his misery and removes the box that's obstructing his view. Someone's in the dog house!","Two identical dogs, one crime: a box of tissues ripped up on the floor .

"Going on daily walks, wagging her tail and leaping about in the snow, this is the lamb who now thinks she is a sheep dog after being raised by Border Collies in the Scottish Highalnds. Hilarious footage shows 10-month-old lamb Pet adopting a bizarre running style as she tries to keep up with the pack of sheep dogs on her owners croft farm in Ullapool in Ross-shire. Pet was taken under the wing of the Collies when owner Mairi Mackenzie brought the young sheep into the croft house after she struggled to survive following her birth in April last year. Wagging her tail and leaping about in the snow, Pet the lamb thinks she is a sheep dog after being raised by Border Collie in the Scottish Highlands . Pet cuddles up to one of the sheep dogs at the croft owned by Mairi McKenzie in Ullapool in Ross-shire . She then instantly bonded with her fellow housemates and was 'adopted' by a sheep dog called Dice and even began sleeping in a dog basket. Now she behaves more like a dog than a lamb and even tries to wag her tail and loves nothing more than going on daily walks with all of the dogs. Ms McKenzie, 51, owner of the Ullapool B&B, said: 'She’s a right character. 'When she was born she wasn’t doing so well so we lifted her from her mother. 'She bonded with the dogs and they accepted her as one of them. 'She’s still a wee bit wobbly but loves to hop, skip and jump around. Pet has adopted her own running style in order to keep up with the dogs . Pet sleeps inside the croft house rather than outside in her own dog basket after struggling to survive when she was first born . 'When she was younger she even slept in the dogs best - she kicked one out of its own bed at one point. 'I’ve never seen anything like this before - it’s really unusual.' Ms McKenzie's daughter Jemma also helps out on the croft and says Pet and the dogs have forged an unbreakable bond. The 23-year-old added: 'When she was young she became so attached to the dogs - when she couldn't see them she would bleat for them. Pet's owners say they will never get rid of her because she has forged an unbreakable bond with the other dogs . 'She became especially attached to the oldest dog and they would take themselves off for walks. 'Once we found them three miles away. 'She was so tame, she would even come and sit in Mum’s office while she worked. 'We’ve kept other lambs as pets before but they’ve never been like this. 'I don’t think we’ll ever get rid of her - the oldest dog would be gutted.'","Lamb Pet struggled to survive following her birth in April last year .

"We spend around a third of our lives asleep. Not only is the weekend lie in the stuff of your weekday dreams, but sleep, along with food, water and oxygen, is essential for human survival. And the amount of shut eye a person gets each night, provides a vital indicator of their overall health. But it seems some of us aren't getting enough time between the sheets. A new study, by experts at the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) in the US, has recommended children aged four months to 17 years old need more sleep than was previously advised. Scroll down for video . A new study by experts at the National Sleep Foundation in the US has recommended how much sleep a person needs at each stage in life, ranging from 14 to 17 hours as a newborn to seven to eight hours as an older adult, aged over 65, pictured . Past studies have found a lack of sleep can increase a person's risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes, shortening life expectancy. In order to determine exactly how much sleep a person needs at each stage of their life, a team of 18 specialists from sleep, anatomy and physiology, as well as paediatrics, neurology, gerontology and gynaecology convened to form an expert panel. The scientists at the NSF in the US worked for two years to produce the most up-to-date guidance. And their findings revealed children  from the age of four months to 17 years old need more sleep than was previously thought. The report states: 'Importantly, the panel emphasised that some individuals might sleep longer or shorter than the recommended times with no adverse effects. 'However, individuals with sleep durations far outside the normal range may be engaging in volitional sleep restriction or have serious health problems. 'An individual who intentionally restricts sleep over a prolonged period may be comprising his or her health and well-being.' The panel recommend: . The NSF's report found children aged four months to 17 years old need more sleep than was previously recommended. Past studies have found a lack of sleep can increase a person's risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes, shortening life expectancy . Charles Czeisler, chair of the board of the NSF and chief of sleep medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said: 'This is the first time that any professional organisation has developed age-specific recommended sleep durations based on a rigorous, systematic review of the world scientific literature relating sleep duration to health, performance and safety. The expert panel said following simple yet effective advice it is possible to improve sleeping habits. They include: . * Sticking to a regular sleep schedule - even at the weekend . * Practising a relaxing bedtime ritual . * Exercising daily . * Switching off all technology some time before going to bed . 'The NSF is providing these scientifically grounded guidelines on the amount of sleep we need each night to improve the sleep health of the millions of individuals and parents who rely on us for this information. 'As the voice for sleep health it is the NSF's responsibility to make sure that our recommendations are supported by the most rigourous science. 'Individuals, particularly parents, rely on us for this information.' Max Hirshkowitz, chair of the NSF Scientific Advisory Council, added: 'The public can be confident that these recommendations represent the best guidance for sleep duration and health.' David Cloud, chief executive of the NSF, added: 'The NSF sleep duration recommendations will help individuals make sleep schedules that are within a healthy range. 'They also serve as a useful starting point for individuals to discuss their sleep with their health care providers.'

"Negotiating new countries, customs and currencies  can be headache-inducing. As with everything, experience counts for a lot, and the smallest of tips can go a long way to making your journey abroad a smooth one. With that in mind, MailOnline Travel has amassed the best expert tips for cheaper trips, comfortable travel and saving on space when you're packing. Scroll down for video . Experience counts for a lot: Don't be rookie; use these experts tips to help you have a hassle-free trip abroad . DELETE COOKIES . This is a sure-fire way to ensure you get your flight for less. João Leitão from adventure travel blog Nomad Revelations says: 'Airline websites keep track of your cookies and they  increase the price of tickets to rush you into buying if they see you keep looking at the same page. 'Every time you actually search for a plane ticket, either go incognito - by using a new computer - or just clean your cookies browser options each time.' TRAVEL BY LAND . Flying may be speedy but you miss out on a lot along the way. Robert Schrader, the creator of travel website Leave Your Daily Hell says: 'Not only does travelling by land allow you to experience a destination better than flying, but it's cheaper and more flexible (you can often buy train and bus tickets last-minute, with little or no close-in booking penalty), allowing you to adjust your travel based on what you're feeling each day, as oppose to how you felt at your desk planning out every detail of the trip. Travel by land: You can be more flexible with your timetable and it's invariably cheaper than booking a flight . Trust locals: Pick a restaurant that is full to the brim with locals at dinner or lunch as it will be the best value . TRUST LOCALS . You might think they are trying to get one over on you, but when it comes to food they know the best places to eat. 'While choosing a place to eat, always pick the restaurant with the most local customers inside. These places will serve the freshest, best value food,' says João Leitão. LEAVE GUIDE BOOKS AT HOME . They weigh down your hand luggage and take up space in your suitcase. 'Rather than taking your entire copy of the Rough Guide or Lonely Planet, just photocopy the pages you need, then discard after you have used them. Saves space and weight,' says James Teideman, Skyscanner Marketing Communications Executive. CUT YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IN HALF . It's this kind of space saving initiative that will get you far while on the road. Save space and reduce weight by sawing your toothbrush in half. The extra three cubic centimetres in your hand luggage can be used to carry extra sheets of paper (see above tip),  toothpaste or toiletries. Bravo! Go it alone by ditching guide books. It'll save space and luggage weight, and you can photocopy key pages . Cut your toothbrush in half: It's this kind of space saving initiative that will get you far while on the road . TRAVEL IN A HOODIE . Hoodies may be the uniform of ASBO holders, but they also make great travel garments. Hide your face when you need a snooze or turn it into a makeshift pillow. 'Just slip up your hood to retreat from the world of noise and light when you want to sleep on a flight, airport seat or bus,' says Sam Baldwin, Skyscanner Travel Editor. PACK HALF OF WHAT YOU WANT . Paul Johnson, a member of the Professional Travel Bloggers Association and who started A Luxury Travel blog, one of the most popular travel blogs in the world, has  simple (if brutal) packing advice. 'Lay out your clothes and any other belongings you wish to take with you, and pack only half. It’s always so much easier to travel light.' Others suggest constraining yourself to 10kg of luggage, no matter where you are going. Hoodies help you sleep while travelling by cutting out sound and light - and they make a great pillow too . Lay out your clothes and any other belongings you wish to take with you, and pack only half to save space . CHOOSE YOUR SEAT ON EACH FLIGHT . No matter how long or short your flight, Paul Johnson says you should always check in early and pick the right seat. 'Some people will want the leg room, others the window seat, others an aisle and some will want to be either near to, or away from, the lavatory,' he says. 'Your best bet to make a proper evaluation would be to look at online resources such as SeatGuru.com and SeatExpert.com, or Skytrax’s own airplane seat guides and maps.' PICK ASIAN OR VEGETARIAN OPTIONS ON FLIGHTS . Food cannot be cooked on board a flight so everything must come pre-cooked ready to be heated up. For this reason vegetables or Asian food is a safer option. 'You get fed before anyone else, you avoid anything too greasy and stodgy (it helps the jet lag, allegedly) and I’m convinced the more niche meals are much better quality as they’re made in smaller batches,' warns Victoria Baillie, Skyscanner PR Manager. Asian and vegetarian options: Made in smaller batches and less stodgy or greasy than other options in-flight . GET LOUNGE ACCESS . According to Paul Johnson: 'Even if you’re not travelling business or first class, there are many ways to gain access to the airport lounges and start your journey in a little more comfort, away from the hustle and bustle of the main terminal thoroughfare.' 'This can be achieved by being a frequent flyer, by signing up for lounge access for the year, purchasing a lounge pass, or – in some cases – by being a premium credit card customer.' Research before you leave the house for stress-free terminal time. MOVE SLOWLY . Paul's last tip is invaluable.  'Too many people try to 'tick off' as many sights, cities and countries as they can. 'Take more time to do less and you'll get a better chance to truly appreciate and get to know a destination. It's a much more relaxing and enjoying way to travel, too. 'What's more, you'll also have plenty of excuses to return to explore other destinations on your next visit.'

"Celebrity interior designer Kelly Hoppen has fallen out with  her  neighbours who claim she is causing 'chaos' while developing her new multi-million pound home in one of London's most exclusive areas. Dragons' Den star Ms Hoppen,  given an MBE in 2009 for services to interior design, is spending a huge sum redeveloping a former auction house in west London into her dream new house. The 55-year-old former step-mother of Sienna Miller is known as the Queen of Taupe because of her love of neutral colours and made her fortune from clients including the Beckhams and Hollywood stars. But she is less popular with her new neighbours, who claim eight months of work on her new project has damaged their homes and left some  'unrentable'. Standing empty: Peter Knight, 57, says he has given up trying to market his £1.6m flat, pictured, because of the noise coming from Kelly Hoppen's new development below . Owners who do not live there say that they are losing up to £40,000-a-year and want compensation from Ms Hoppen for loss of earnings. The designer, who has also designed interiors for yachts, European châteaux and British Airways planes, has offered landlord Peter Knight, 57, around £4,500 but he believes it should be around £14,500. He says he has given up trying to market his £1,000-a-week flat, worth around £1.6million, because of the noise. Row: Developer Kelly Hoppen has been given a MBE for services to interior design and is the star of Dragons' Den . He said: 'She is using her power and celebrity to pay us the lowest compensation possible but that is not how things should be done. 'It has put an enormous amount of stress on my partner and made her unwell. It is her only source of income but nobody has wanted to live there because it is a building site. The noise has also been unbearable. 'Ms Hoppen's company has been using pneumatic drills to dig out the basement and it left large cracks in the walls of the flats. 'We have given up on viewings after eight months because people said they can't live with the noise. It is unrentable. 'All we are doing is trying to get Kelly Hoppen to pay a fair compensation for the chaos caused by her works. 'She has told us she wants to be a good neighbour but clearly she doesn't. I have tried over and over again to meet her but have been met with complete prevarication'. Mr Knight believes that Ms Hoppen should pay £14,500 compensation but he broke off negotiations last month when he was offered in the region of £4,500. Other neighbouring landlords are similarly upset about the way they have been treated by the interior designer. Magdalena Gatzinska said at times dozens of people a week had viewed her flat last year but had refused to take it on. She believes she has lost around £40,000 in rental income. She said: 'Kelly Hoppen has the right to develop a property, like anyone else, but I think the way this has been managed has been extremely unethical. 'There is noise from 8am and have no idea when the work will be completed. The shaking from digging the basement cracked the walls and shook things off the shelves. 'All she had to do is come to see us and tell us  what is happening. There has been nothing and we have no idea how long the work will go on for. 'My tenant has a child who is crying because of the noise. They can't be there during the day. The site is also unsafe. 'It is not about the money. This is about ethics but she and the builders just don't seem to care.' Ms Gatzinska claims last year a Hollywood actress rented her flat but then asked to leave because of the noise. After months empty a new tenant has moved in at half the market rate but also looks set to leave, she says. MailOnline understands Ms Hoppen has paid for the damage to walls in Mr Knight's flat and others but is yet to agree compensation over rental problems. World renowned: Ms Hoppen has designed homes and interiors for A-listers including the Beckhams and her latest project is under her name, pictured on a board outside her new home . There is also a dispute over who should pay for waterproofing of her ceilings, as it is understood she believes it is the responsibility of the flatowners above her. In 2012 she annoyed neighbours with noise from air conditioning units she fitted at her current £6million home in Notting Hill  without prior council approval. One critic said that their 'peace and quiet' was at stake and eventually the dispute ended when Ms Hoppen agreed to turn the units off if they got too noisy. The designer told MailOnline she is 'trying to be neighbourly' and said some residents 'seem to be very happy with the proposed improvement to the building'. She said: 'London is an evolving city and has many developments that are going on all across the capital. Sadly these developments have a relatively short term negative effect on surrounding properties. For London to improve these developments need to happen and in the short-term this affects the local community negatively but in the long term improve London as a whole. Couple: Kelly Hoppen, who is twice divorced, pictured with her current partner, businessman John Gardiner . 'The building contractors, I believe, have worked within all the guidelines set out by the local authority and I made sure the builders undertook the work over as short period of time as possible. 'I have already compensated our neighbours with thousands of pounds. I understand that it is inconvenient for our neighbours to experience these works and have tried to be as neighbourly as possible. I did however ask if the builders were permitted access to a number of our neighbours balcony to stop a water leak coming into our property. Sadly, one neighbour refused access asking for further compensation. Close: Kelly Hoppen remains close to actress step-daughter Sienna Miller, who still calls her 'mum' 'I really do sympathise with the neighbours as there are several other developments going on within this building, the large development behind my space is noisy to this date'. Ms Hoppen said the building's freeholder is carrying out work as well and says 'the majority of noise originates' from that works, a claim denied by neighbours. She added that she has paid for works inside and outside the building and 'I have not asked our neighbours or the freeholder to contribute towards these costs'. The interiors queen is in a relationship with businessman John Gardiner after twice being married and says he's 'the one'. Mr Gardiner is believed to help with her development projects. She first married in 1982, but her marriage to restaurateur Graham Corrett ended seven years later. They have a daughter Natasha, a chef and food writer. She later married Ed Miller, an American investment banker turned art dealer, ended in 2006 after he joined the cult in the United States. Mr Miller had two daughters, actress Sienna Miller and her fashion designer sister Savannah. They still call her 'mum'. She has also been in relationships with former England defender Sol Campbell, DJ Jamie Theakston and hairdresser Nicky Clarke, but spit with him because of his infidelity.","EXCLUSIVE: Ms Hoppen, 55, is redeveloping new home in west London .

In China, online addiction among young people has become a serious problem, with an estimated 24million children considered 'web junkies'. Research published in December last year found that 7.1 per cent of the population in Asia is addicted to the internet. Growing problem: An estimated 24 million children in China are considered addicted to the internet . Screens off: Taiwanese under-18s are no longer allowed to 'constantly use electronic products for a period of time that is not reasonable' under new legislation . As well as introducing laws requiring games companies 'to develop techniques that would limit the gaming time of minors', more than 250 military style boot camps have been set up across China to tackle under-18 internet addiction. Last month, neighbouring Taiwan passed a law banning parents from allowing their children under the age of two from using electronic devices such as iPads, televisions and smartphones. Parents who allow their young children to play with their gadgets face fines of up to £1,000. Meanwhile Taiwanese under-18s are not allowed to 'constantly use electronic products for a period of time that is not reasonable', although the 'reasonable length of time' has not been defined. The new law means that iPads, smartphones and televisions are now listed alongside cigarettes and alcohol as restricted. Research published in the British Medical Journal found that a child born today will have spent a full year staring at screens (tablets, computers, TVs) by the time they reach seven.","Chinese boy, 19, used a kitchen knife to sever his own hand .

"A challenger to a mayor accused of stealing votes was smeared as a racist and likened to Oswald Mosely, a court heard today. John Biggs was branded a 'John Bigot'  when he stood up to Lutfur Rahman, Britain’s first elected Muslim mayor, it was said. The claims were made at the rare electoral fraud trial at which Rahman is alleged to have cheated an election to win power. His rival Mr Biggs, the Labour Party’s candidate who narrowly lost the ‘rigged’ poll to Rahman, claimed there was a cynical campaign to cost him votes by falsely portraying him as a racist to the Muslim community of East London’s Tower Hamlets. Election case: Supporters of Lutfur Rahman, who runs Tower Hamlets Council (pictured campaigning last April), allegedly branded Labour rival John Biggs a racist in a bid to smear him . Mr Biggs was dubbed ‘John Bigot’ by Rahman’s cronies who also compared him to 1930s fascist leader Mosely and warned voters in the devout area he planned to open ‘sex clubs’, the High Court was told. Rahman is accused of presiding over a ‘den of iniquity’ and masterminding a campaign of corruption, intimidation and fraud to steal the May 2014 mayoral election - and of smearing anyone who challenged him as ‘racist or Islamaphobic’. Mr Biggs was dubbed ‘John Bigot’ by Rahman’s cronies who also compared him to 1930s fascist leader Mosely . Mr Biggs told the court that Rahman’s election agent Alibor Choudhury had proclaimed in a February 2014 town hall debate: ‘Oswald Mosley has his Blackshirts, John Biggs has his black cardigans.’ Mr Biggs added: 'He gestured towards me as he made [the remark about Mosely]' and said nothing he or his party had done was '‎comparable to the actions of Oswald Mosely‎', adding the comment was 'deliberately provocatively divisive and designed as part of a cumulative campaign to label me as a racist.' The Blackshirts infamously fought police and anti-fascists in the East End borough during the ‘Battle of Cable Street’ in 1936. Mr Biggs – who was defeated by 3,252 votes on a turnout of 84,234 - said: ‘In summary, I have been the target of a protracted campaign to present me falsely as a racist, and this has influence public opinion in a way which has in my view influences the election result.’ The court was told that another of Rahman’s acolytes, Councillor Gulam Robbani, posted a comment on a social network which claimed: 'John Biggs is bad news for Tower Hamlets. His councillors are already planning sex clubs in our borough and planning to put up Council Tax.’ Rahman’s party, Tower Hamlets First, had also issued a ‘dishonest’ press release accusing Labour members of planning a ‘fun day’ to coincide with a march by the far-right English Defence League, said Mr Biggs. ‘I believe that these statements were deliberately made, in the knowledge that they were false, in order to polarise opinion and to attempt to influence the election result. ‘The intention of these unfounded attacks was to divert voters from supporting me, either by not voting at all or by supporting another candidate.’ Opposition: Four residents, Andrew Erlam, left, Debbie Simone, Azmal Hussein, right, and Angela Moffat, plan to call 100 witnesses to prove the election was rigged . Historic: The High Court is hearing the rare electoral trial, which could result in a new election, mayor Rahman being suspended or banned from office or completely exhonerated . The electoral fraud trial is being heard by the Electoral Commissioner Richard Mawrey QC, who has the power to strip Rahman’s of his mayoralty and bar him from public office. The case, under the Representation of the People Act 1983, has been brought not by the police, but by four local residents ‘fed up’ with Rahman’s corrupt practices. Petitioners Andrew Erlam, Debbie Simone, Azmal Hussein and Angela Moffat – who face huge legal fees if they lose – accuse Rahman and Choudhury of ‘corruption and illegal practices’. They say local voters were ‘systematically’ robbed of a fair poll when Rahman was re-elected mayor. Postal votes were stolen, ballot papers forged, elderly voters manipulated and an army of ‘ghost voters’ registered on the electoral roll, it was said. Mobs of Rahman supporters allegedly intimidated voters at polling stations and told them it was a ‘sin’ against Islam to vote for anyone else, leaving one young man in tears. Women in polling booths had their ballot papers filled in for them by men, with one presiding officer describing a ‘constant battle’ to prevent fraud unfolding under his nose, the court heard. Seat of power: Mayor Rahman has started his second term in charge of Tower Hamlets Council in east London, which has a £1billion budget . As mayor, Bangladesh-born Rahman – who won power in 2010 and 2014 – abused his position to funnel hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money to dodgy groups run by his cronies, the campaigners claim. Some of the petitioners’ 100 witnesses have been ‘threatened’ and are too scared to give evidence, said their barrister Francis Hoar who opened the case by claiming 49-year-old Rahman’s supporters ‘didn’t give a damn about the law’. Controversial former lawyer Rahman – who flew the Palestinian flag over the town hall and has a £42,000-a-year chauffeur – was in court today, having been absent on the opening day. Wearing a purple tie and navy blue suit, he sat facing the electoral judge as Mr Biggs gave evidence from the witness stand. Rahman denies any wrongdoing. His QC, Duncan Penny, said there was ‘little if any’ evidence against him and described the claims as ‘invention’, ‘exaggeration’ and ‘in some cases downright deliberately false allegations.’ The case continues.

"Police 'rammed' a car containing a five-year-old boy and his pregnant mother after mistaking it for a vehicle used in an armed robbery due to a registration mix-up. Shiri Rahman, her husband Abdur, sister Rujeena, and Mohammed Eesaa, five, were driving home in the early hours of Monday morning after picking up their son from Bradford Royal Infirmary, West Yorkshire, when the incident happened. The Bradford family was barricaded in by three unmarked cars, one containing armed officers, which crashed into the back of their Lexus. The family was terrified as they didn't realise it was the police and suffered head, neck and back pain as a result of the impact. Police 'rammed' a car containing Abdur Rahman, his pregnant wife and her sister, and their son, Mohammed Eesaa, five, after mistaking it for a vehicle used in an armed robbery due to a registration mix-up . The Rahmans were driving them son home Bradford Royal Infirmary, West Yorkshire when the incident happened about 12.30am yesterday; Mohammed suffered whiplash in the incident . Police had stopped the vehicle after responding to an alert over a car used during an armed robbery of a jewellers in Doncaster the day before. Three masked men had entered the HL Browns store with weapons including a hammer and an axe before fleeing with a haul of watches. The men fled the scene in a car, damaging a police car during their getaway, before ditching it. Mrs Rahman, who is 11-weeks pregnant, said:  'I would never have imagined myself in such a terrifying position. 'I was looking out of the window and it felt like we were in a crime scene you would see on a movie set. My son was in tears, my husband and sister were in shock and I was having an anxiety attack. I could hardly breath. 'The worst part is the incident shut down traffic and the noise caused people to come out and see what was going on. We were made to look like criminals.' The family was driving along Ingleby Road, which goes into Horton Grange Road,  when police stopped them at 12.30am. Mrs Rahman, a counter assistant in a chemist, said: 'It all happened so fast. My husband saw a car waiting at the lights when they went green so he flashed it with his lights to try and alert them. We didn't realise it was an unmarked police car at the time and went around it when it would not move. 'As soon as we went passed, my husband noticed the car started to follow us. He slowed down to let the car pass. It went in front of us and braked, forcing my husband to stop but then we were hit by another car which pulled up beside us and then a third one hit us in the back.' The family were driving along Horton Grange Road in Bradford about 12.30am yesterday when three police cars closed in around them and forced them to stop by braking in front of them and ramming them from behind . The family were thrown about their car as the police rammed their vehicle multiple times. Mr Rahman, a 34-year-old waiter, was taken into a police car while checks were made, and another officer got in the family's car and took their details. Police explained the situation to the family and apologised for the mix-up, but Mrs Rahman said their actions were aggressive and unnecessary.  The family were told the vehicle involved in the robbery used cloned registration plates similar to the one on their vehicle. 'The force was unnecessary. There was no chase and we even slowed down for them even in a 30 speed limit area with speed cameras around. They never alerted us with a light or siren to pull over.' Police stopped the vehicle after responding to an alert over a car used during an armed robbery of HL Browns jewellery store in Doncaster, above, the day before; three masked men had entered the store with weapons including a hammer and an axe before fleeing with a haul of watches . She said she is now taking medication for her head and her son suffered 'severe whiplash' as a result of the crash. Detective Superintendent Jon Morgan, of Bradford District Police, said pulled the Rahman's car over after receiving information about a vehicle 'which was believed to have been used in an armed robbery'. He said: 'Following inquiries, a vehicle bearing the suspected number plate was sighted in Ingleby Road, Bradford. 'In accordance with the information received armed officers were deployed to stop the vehicle safely, which resulted in a minor collision.' Det. Sup. Morgan said an ambulance was called to attend to the family. The vehicle involved in the robbery, has since been recovered. Details about the robbery were not yet available.","The Rahmans were returning from hospital when their car was rammed .

"Mysterious cases of paralysis in children in the United States may be caused by a previously rare virus spread by sneezing and coughing, according to doctors. More than 100 children and young adults in the US and one child in France have been taken to hospital with unexplained weakness and paralysis in their limbs, known as acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), since September last year. A condition, more commonly associated with the polio virus, had been known to cause similar symptoms, but since the virus was eradicated it has become rare. Scroll down for video . Enterovirus D68, the structure of which is shown above imposed upon a black and white electron microscope image of the virus, is now  the prime suspect in clusters of mysterious limb paralysis in children in the USA . The recent outbreak of AFP has alarmed doctors and they now believe another, unknown virus may be causing the condition. Researchers found that a cluster of children suffering from ongoing paralysis despite treatment in Aurora, Colorado had also suffered from infections of respiratory viruses within three months of their condition appearing. Enteroviruses are a type of virus that use a single strand of RNA to replicate themselves inside the cells of mammals. Among other enteroviruses are polio, the virus that causes Hand Foot and Mouth disease along with others that cause a range of respiratory illnesses. Enterovirus D-68 is among the most recently idenfitied and was first spotted in California in 1962. It can cause mild to severe respiratory illness and is likely to be spread by inhaling virus particles when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or touches a surface. In previous years only small numbers of EV-D68 infections have been reported but that has increased during 2014, according to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. It has caused severe illness in a number of children and has even been implicated in some deaths. The incidence of infections has fallen off considerably since October but public health officials warn that infections seem to spike during the late summer and autumn. The scientists found that almost half the children had been infected by a previously rare virus called enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), which is distantly related to polio. These children were also found to have damage to the neurons in their spinal cord and in their brainstem. The researchers now believe this virus could be behind 107 other unexplained cases of paralysis that have been reported across the USA and a further case reported in France. Dr Samuel Dominguez, a microbial epidemiologist at the Children's Hospital Colorado, who led the research, said: 'The extent to which this new distinctive neurological disease has spread is unknown, but it does not appear to be isolated to Colorado or the USA. 'If further investigation confirms the link between EV-D68 and AFP and cranial nerve dysfunction, EV-D68 will be added to the list of non-poliovirus enteroviruses capable of causing severe, potentially irreversible neurological damage, and finding effective antiviral therapies and vaccines will be a priority.' First identified in California in 1962, it is known to cause mild symptoms of fever, sneezing and runny nose, but was rarely seen. However, since August 2014 it has been linked to more than 1,000 respiratory infections through out the USA. The researchers in Colorado, whose findings are published in the Lancet  tested 12 children who had been admitted to hospital with unexplained paralysis in their limbs. They found that eight of the children had suffered from a respiratory viral infection before being affected, five of which were identified as EV-D68. While the findings do not conclusively prove that EV-D68 is responsible for the paralysis, there is other circumstantial evidence. Other cases of paralysis have appeared during wider outbreaks of EV-D68. Researchers detected EV-D68 in nasal swabs from 8 out 41 people with paralysis who were tested. There are also signs that the virus has been mutating from its original form since it first appeared in the 1960s. Scientists at Purdue University in Indiana are now attempting to develop a treatment to combat infection by the virus. They performed X-ray crystallography of the virus and found that its protective shell contains a pocket that helps it infect cells. This image shows enterovirus D68 while bound to an antiviral compound called pleconaril (shown in orange). Researchers are working on new antiviral molecules that might work against more recent strains of the virus . They found that it is possible to bind a molecule within this pocket to prevent this infection from happening. Professor Michael Rossman, who is leading the work, said they are now hoping to find compounds that might bind to the virus in this way and could be safely taken as drugs. One antiviral drug, known as pleconaril, was found to act against early strains of the virus, but is ineffective against more recent strains. Professor Rossman said: 'Designing the best possible compound for these newer strains will take more time, but I hope that in a year or so we might have something.'","Clusters of acute flaccid paralysis have been springing up around the USA .

"A mistress of Dominique Strauss-Kahn received a £900 pair of designer boots and the promise of 'learning new sex games' in return for attending orgies, it is alleged. The claim is a crucial part of the evidence in the former International Monetary Fund chief's pimping trial which entered its second day in Lille, northern France, today. Strauss-Kahn, 65, faces up to 10 years in prison if it is proved that he paid women to attend sex parties all over the world. But the 'girlfriend', identified only as Sylvie, told police that if she became his regular mistress, he would reward her with presents and sex games, rather than cash. Scroll down for video . Accused: Dominique Strauss-Kahn Stauss leaves the courthouse on the first day of his trial in Lille yesterday. He is accused of sex offences, including the alleged procuring of prostitutes . Co-defendant: Rene Kojfer arrives at the courthouse in Lille on the second day of the trial this morning . Claims: Rene Kojfer, a former Carlton public relations officer, arrives on the second day of the trial . The presents and sex games included Strauss-Kahn taking the 'girlfriend' to the Bois de Boulogne, the wood to the west of Paris, blindfolding her, and 'watching her' having sex with other men. At the time, Strauss-Kahn was married to the multi-millionaire art heiress and journalist Anne Sinclair, 66, who divorced him last year. According to the charge sheet in Lille, northern France, Strauss-Kahn was guilty of 'aggravated pimping', which means managing more than one prostitute. He is specifically accused of 'aiding, abetting or protecting' the prostitution of seven women whom he slept with regularly. But, in court documents, a number of 'girlfriends' admit they attended orgies organised by Strauss-Kahn, who was once seen being 'entertained' by up to eight women at one time at the Murat Hotel, in Paris. French lawyer and defendant Emmanuel Riglaire arrives at the court in Lille, northern France this morning on the second day of the so-called 'Carlton Case' trial . Francis Henrion (left), a former Carlton Hotel manager, and David Roque, ex-director of the BTP Eiffage construction group subsidiary and defendant  (right), arrive at the courthouse in Lille this morning . Four prostitutes identified as Melanie, Mounia, Sabrina and Sandrine are civil plaintiffs in the case. Some, who are not appearing in court, allege being forced into 'brutal' sex with Strauss-Kahn. One, called Marie-Anne, said the would-be President of France, said he committed a 'bestial act' during a particularly 'violent' sex session in Washington DC in December 2010. David Roquet, one of 13 co-defendants in the dock with Strauss-Kahn, is said to have held the woman down while the act took place. Marie-Anne abandoned a lawsuit for rape, but refused to take part in any more orgies with Strauss-Kahn, according to the court documents. In the dock: Ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn (centre) with co-defendants Emmanuel Riglaire (left), Jean-Christophe Lagarde (second left) and French businessman Fabrice Paszkowski (second right) at Lille courthouse on the first day of the trial yesterday . Police officers conduct security searches with a sniffer dog at the Lille courthouse, northern France, prior to the start of the  trial . Defence barristers for Strauss-Kahn complained that allegations emerging in court were a violation of his rights to privacy. Socialist cabinet minister Segolene Royal, the mother of President Francois Hollande's four children, asked that court proceedings be closed to the media, so children would not hear the sordid details, the court heard. Strauss-Kahn denies all the charges. He admits attending 'libertine parties', but has insisted that he did not know any of the women involved were prostitutes. The case continues. Once tipped to become the next president of France, Dominique Strauss Kahn became the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, in 2007. But the powerful French lawyer and politician's career was left in tatters after he was accused of raping a chambermaid at a New York hotel in 2011. Nafissatou Diallo, 32, alleged that Strauss Kahn had assaulted her when she entered his room. The case later collapsed because of problems surrounding the credibility of the witness and he settled out of court. He resigned from the IMF on 18 May 2011 but a series of sordid revelations about Strauss Khan's sex life were to follow. Journalist Tristane Banon came forward during the case claiming that Strauss Kahn had attempted to rape her. He admitted trying to kiss her but in October 2011, prosecutors dropped the case over lack of evidence. The following year, Strauss Kahn came under investigation over his alleged involvement in a prostitution ring which was linked to hiring prostitutes for sex parties at hotels in Lille, Paris and Washington. Charges of gang rape in Washington were dropped in October 2012 after the alleged victim told police they were playing consensual 'sex games'. In July 2013, the shamed former IMF boss was told he would stand trial over allegations of 'aggravated pimping' at the Carlton Hotel in Lille, France in a case which would later become known as the Carlton Affair. The scandal-struck life of Strauss Kahn was the inspiration for film Welcome to New York - featuring 'Gérard Depardieu as Devereaux, a character modeled on D.S.K.","Finance chief rewarded mistress with gifts and sex games, court hears .

"Residents have been left baffled and bemused after contractors botched a painting job by marking out a parking bay around a signpost. A photograph taken by a surprised resident shows the new parking bay in Romford, east London, marked out with white paint at the side of the road. But the contractor appears to have been oblivious to the signpost around which they've painted - which clearly makes using the space impossible. The parking space in Romford, east London, was measured out and painted despite the presence of the signpost . Retired engineer Phil Wailing, 63, spotted the metal post surrounded by fresh white paint as he walked his dog near his home on Sunday. Bemused grandfather-of-two Mr Wailing said: 'It really beggars belief. 'I think the contractors must have been down the Aspen Tree pub at the end of the road before they started painting. 'It smacks of the work of jobsworths but you've got to laugh.' Havering Council said contractors 'mistakenly' painted around the sign on a pavement and the paint would be removed as soon as possible. Erroneous, and often baffling, council paint jobs are surprisingly common - in December, Britain's shortest double yellow lines were found on a street in Cambridge. The road markings are designed to separate a residents' parking zone (left) with a pay and display area (right) The lines have taken over the title as Britain's shortest double yellows from another set in Cambridge . The 11 inches long marking on Hamilton Road, Chesterton, were designed to separate a residents' parking zone with a pay and display area. But residents and motorists said the markings, which are about the same length as two iPhone 6's, were a 'ridiculous' waste of time and money and branded them 'pathetic'. Jennie Youce, of Burwell, parked up next to the line and said: 'It is absolutely ridiculous. What a complete waste of time and money. I can't understand why they even bothered with it. It is pathetic. 'And the question is, are they the exact distance between the residents' parking bays and the pay and display signs? Because they look a lot wider than that.' Another bungled paint job to bewilder locals occurred in Cumbria when workers painted double yellow lines across the entrance to a hospital. The double yellow lines were painted through a busy T-intersection and across the face of a hospital . The workers painted the no-parking zone outside Workington Community Hospital in Cumbria because they were using maps from before it was built. Drivers labelled the situation an 'embarrassment' and a 'waste of cash' because Cumbria County Council would have to get them removed. Robert Benham, Havering Council's cabinet member for environment, said: 'This is a very silly mistake and I’ll be taking this up with our contractor personally - this isn’t the first time common-sense has been called into question, there has been a catalogue of errors.'","Council contractors bungle paint job by marking space around signpost .

"A former Royal Marine and his girlfriend have been jailed after they were found with £1million of MDMA stashed in their hotel room for a planned drug deal after they befriended a pusher while on holiday in Ibiza. As Leah Parkes, 28, and Charles Hendrie, 30, supped cocktails and partied on the Spanish island they struck up a friendship with drug pusher Adib Asfour and began working with him and selling drugs to clubbers. The pair continued to be involved in the drugs scene when they returned to England and were caught carrying out a service station drug deal -using  the Holiday Inn Express just off the M6 motorway at Stafford as a base from which to deal £1million worth of MDMA. Charles Hendrie and Leah Parkes have been jailed after they befriended a drug dealer while on holiday in Ibiza, and were involved in a £1million service station MDMA deal when they returned to the UK . Parkes was jailed for seven years for her role in the £1million drug deal, planned for a month by the pair . When police caught the couple they found they had suitcases stuffed with 36 packages of the ecstasy-like drug. The globe trotting couple had previously been to a number of exotic locations including a sailing holiday in the Bahamas and a romantic trip to Paris. Hendrie, from Greater Manchester, had toured Iraq and Afghanistan before working as a bodyguard to several pop stars and businessmen. He is believed to have become embroiled in the drugs scene, along with his Parkes - his girlfriend of two years - after they met Asfour in Ibiza. All three have been jailed for a total of 27 years. Parkes and Hendrie had gone to Ibiza for a romantic holiday in July 2013. Pictures taken during their trip show them dancing and drinking in some of the island's most famous nightclubs as well as enjoying the sunshine on the beach and boats. The pair became involved in the drug scene as they enjoyed their holiday on the party island, selling tickets to events as well as recreational drugs to clubbers they met. Stafford Crown Court heard that they spent about a month planning a large MDMA drug deal when they returned to the UK. Then in November they hired a van and drove from Manchester with two empty suitcases to The Holiday Inn Express hotel in Acton Gate, Stafford, just off junction 13 of the M6.  Parkes booked the room and went to bed complaining of a headache. Parkes (left) and Hendrie (right) were found guilty of conspiracy to supply drugs by a jury . Police recovered dozens of packets of the drugs at the hotel as well as in a suitcase being carried by the pair . Hendrie then travelled to a warehouse in Brownhills in the West Midlands, where he collected 34kg of MDMA before driving back to the poorly lit car park of the service station hotel. The drugs were transferred into the two suitcases before they were wheeled into the room. Asfour then arrived at the hotel room empty handed before leaving ten minutes later with Parkes' shoulder bag, believed to contain three kilos of MDMA. Hendrie and Parkes then left the hotel with a suitcase . But they were stopped by police on the M6 southbound who found the suitcase was stuffed with 16 airtight packages of the ecstasy-style drug. Mr Parkes used to be a Royal Marine and had served in Iraq and Afghanistan before working as a bodyguard to several pop stars. He was given a Royal Marines cake (right) to celebrate his 30th birthday. The couple have travelled around the world, enjoying sailing holidays as well as a trip to Ibiza (pictured) Pictures from Facebook show Parks and Hendrie visiting Paris and kissing outside the Eiffel Tower . The couple were arrested and a search of their room uncovered another suitcase containing 19 packages of MDMA. In total 34.8kg of MDMA with a street value of £1.05million was found by officers. The next morning an email was sent to the hotel from someone claiming to be Parkes, saying she had left her bag in the room and someone would collect it. Chloe Arrowsmith, 24, from London, came to collect the bag - not realising Parkes was already in custody. Arrowsmith, who was cleared of wrongdoing, was described by police as ""a sacrificial lamb"" who was used in a 'cleansing run' where drug dealers would have someone collect drugs to see if the police are watching them. Another man Mark Harrington, 28, of Salford was also cleared. Parkes and Hendrie, both from Bury, Greater Manchester, and Asfour, of Wolverhampton denied a charge of conspiring to supply controlled class A drugs between October 1, 2013 and November 8, 2013. Adib Asfour is said to have collected drugs from the couple's base at a service station of the M6 and dozens of packets of MDMA were found stuffed inside a suitcase where Hendrie and Parkes had based themselves . Police found a suitcase stuffed with airtight packets of MDMA in a car the couple were found travelling in . But the trio were found guilty by a jury after a trial at Stafford Crown Court in October last year. Asfour and Hendrie were both jailed for 10 years while Parkes received a seven year sentence. Judge Michael Challinor said: 'Ibiza is a party island, drugs are readily available. 'People are more likely to do something there that they would never dream of doing in the UK.' The jury of seven women and five men convicted Hendrie by an unanimous decision but Parkes and Asfour were found guilty by a majority verdict of 10 for and two against. Hendrie and Parkes became part of a team that sold tickets to events and also sold recreational drugs . The couple were pictured enjoying evenings at a number of clubs and bars across the Spanish party island . Hendrie was jailed for 10 years and Parkes for seven years for conspiracy to supply controlled drugs . The couple are said to have become embroiled in the drug scene and dealing when on holiday in July 2013 . Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Simon Bowden, of Staffordshire Police, said: 'Staffordshire Police will not tolerate drug misuse and we will take dealers, and their associates, off the streets. 'Although the defendants do not live in Staffordshire they used the area as a central meeting point to exchange, and deal, a large quantity of MDMA. 'Following information received, officers intercepted Hendrie and Parkes on the M6. In a series of snaps posted online the pair are shown enjoying the sunshine and sea on the island . Police found 34kg worth of MDMA that had been stashed by the couple at the Holiday Inn for the drug deal . Parkes and Hendrie had been together for two years when they went on holiday and met drug dealer Asfour . 'Their arrest, and a detailed investigation, led to the arrest of three other people suspected of being involved in drug crime. 'We also stopped 34.8kg of MDMA, with a street value of £1.05m, from getting on to the streets. 'Together with our partners we will continue to take a tough stance on criminals involved in drugs and related criminal behaviour.'","Leah Parkes and Charles Hendrie took a romantic holiday to Ibiza in 2013 .

"Bill Shankly, as always, had an idea. Not content with beating opponents with style, he wanted teams to be trembling at the mere sight of Liverpool. So, having watched Real Madrid and been struck by the stunning simplicity of their white kit, Shankly made a radical change on November 25, 1964. In a European Cup tie against Anderlecht at Anfield, Liverpool wore all red for the first time in their history and never looked back. ‘He thought the colour scheme would carry a psychological impact,’ Ian St John, who scored the first goal that night, would later recall. ‘Red for power, red for danger.’ Tuesday marked the 50th anniversary from when Liverpool changed their kit from white shorts to all red . On the 50th anniversary of that seismic change, when Liverpool stopped wearing white shorts and socks, Brendan Rodgers used words that Shankly would have expected in conjunction with a red shirt - resilience, spirit, character - but not from a front-foot position. This has been a chastening period for the current incumbent of the Anfield manager’s seat, a run of four consecutive defeats sending Liverpool’s campaign to the brink of crisis. No longer a garment to elicit fear, it has been the outfit this campaign of a team perceived to be a soft touch. In the wake of Sunday’s capitulation at Crystal Palace, Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher led the criticism, lambasting his old team’s mental weakness. As Liverpool look to preserve their Champions League status here in Bulgaria on Wednesday, Rodgers explained why he saw things differently. ‘We hear criticism of the team but this team has character - it showed it last season,’ said Rodgers. ‘It has got resilience. OK, we concede more than we would like at times but you can’t question the character. It can’t be criticised. We have players who’ve shown they have spirit. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has come under fire for the club's poor displays this season . Liverpool's defeat to Crystal Palace was their fourth straight in all competitions . If Basle pick up more points than Liverpool, then Brendan Rodgers’ side are out. If Basle lose, Liverpool could still survive for the final match-day, even if they lose to Ludogorets. If Liverpool win, it will all come down to their final group match against Basle next month. ‘But when you don’t get victories it is life. If you don’t do it with confidence you don’t do it quite as good. My job is to keep instilling it. It (being easily beatable) is a comment that has been made. It’s something when you’re paid to be critics - well, not critics - but to assess the team. ‘When you lose games, what I’ve learnt is that people will say what they want. That is what comes. I’ve said before whether criticism is deserved or not you won’t like it. You just have to ignore it, you just have to not listen to it. I have a team full of characters, full of people fully committed. ‘Hopefully that’s something that will improve. But we need to improve, we need to be better. You talk about sport - you need to have persistence, you need to have resilience. That persistence gets you through. Losing can be the making of you.’ That last point is debatable. Rodgers has never lost five consecutive games as a manager but if the current sequence extends and Liverpool falter against opponents who pushed them so close at Anfield in September, the atmosphere on Merseyside will descend further. Despite the bad run of form, Rodgers (left) is adamant the squad's character will see their fortunes change . The Liverpool squad were put through their paces in training on Tuesday ahead of their Champions League tie . Rodgers, to his credit, never ducked an issue on Tuesday night and, describing his role as one of the ‘pillars of the team and the club’, he set a positive tone. He is not in the mood to dwell on the wretched results that have tumbled one after another. There was, though, realism and pragmatism in his message. Rodgers’ dream maybe to inflict ‘death by football’ on teams but he is not going to kill Liverpool’s campaign by pursuing it to the detriment of everything else. That is why in the Vasil Levski Stadium, he will make Liverpool something they haven’t been - difficult to beat. Brazil midfielder Lucas will come in to bolster the midfield, enabling Steven Gerrard to move forward, and Kolo Toure will return, to plug the holes Dejan Lovren has been leaving. Midfielder Lucas (right) is expected to start alongside Steven Gerrard for Wednesday's clash in Bulgaria . ‘That (getting a result) has been the case now for a number of weeks,’ said Rodgers. ‘The philosophy is important and we know how we want to work but you need to get results. You need to find results. We would take a scrappy win. ‘Listen, you can’t play perfect football. It is going to be tough. We want to get a result.’ And why does he retain faith that they will leave their moribund form behind and, somehow, sneak a place in the knockout stages? ‘It is sport,’ he replied. ‘It is football. If we didn’t feel that we could, we may as well pack up and go home. We all work tirelessly at our jobs. I am a better manager than I was 12 months ago because of experience. ‘The players are working so, so hard and are fully committed. We need to improve but when the tide turns - which it will do - we will be in a better place to move on. Sometimes it just takes a game, an action to change a season for you. We have to believe that can happen.’ Kolo Toure (right) is expected to play in central defence at the expense of Dejan Lovren against Ludogorets .","Liverpool travel to Ludogorets for Wednesday's Champions League tie .

"A 12-year-old dancer  taught by the Royal Ballet has stood up to bullies with a desperate open letter and video message declaring: 'This has to stop'. Connor Williams made the heartbreaking plea after saying he had been tormented physically and emotionally every day since he started high school in September in Blackpool, Lancashire. Connor danced with the Royal Ballet's Primary Steps programme for four years until last year, but said he started hiding his hobby after being picked on by other pupils. Thousands of people have now viewed Connor's appeal after his mother Francine, 29, posted it on Facebook and YouTube - and he says he wants to send a message of hope to other children like him. Scroll down for video . Defiant: Schoolboy Connor Williams, 12, has stood up to bullies with a desperate open letter and video message declaring: 'This has to stop'. He said he has been tormented in his first term at his new high school . Open letter: Connor named his alleged abusers and included speech bubbles of them saying 'you're a waste of space' and 'Haha why are you here, go s*** your mum'. He then wrote: 'I just wanna stick up for myself' A-grade pupil Connor, now part of a group called Gifted and Talented, regularly takes part in shows and appeared as Elton John last year in the Schools Alive show at Blackpool's Grand Theatre. He has also performed in shows with the adult Royal Ballet in London when he was with Primary Steps, his previous group which he has now outgrown. Year Seven pupil Connor said he had been physically and emotionally hurt by his alleged bullies. He ended up in a fight with a boy he had never spoken to before after fellow pupils began hitting him ahead of a PE lesson at his school, Montgomery High in Blackpool, he claimed. On another occasion he was pinned up against a wall by two Year 11 pupils, his mother said. Connor's letter featured drawings of six tormentors with speech bubbles saying 'you're a waste of space' and 'Haha why are you here, go s*** your mum'. The others are seen calling him a 'small gett' and say: 'Haha ye go do that you small non-human child'. Video: This clip was shared online by Connor's mother Francine and has been viewed thousands of times . The drawing was accompanied by the names of his seven alleged bullies under the title: 'People who have bullied Connor, 28/1/15'. Below it he wrote an open letter, which he showed in the video posted online. It declared: 'Ever since I started at Montgomery, I've been bullied. 'People I don't know have bullied me. It hurts just to ignore them. I'm nearly in year eight now and since I told the teachers, they were no help at all. 'I just wanna stick up for myself but I can't, I'm not strong enough. PLEASE HELP! This has to stop!!!!' The two-minute video of Connor reading extracts from his letter was shared more than 100 times on Facebook and viewed more than 10,000 times. The schoolboy said: 'I was just getting sick of it, and after the last time it happened, I just got a piece of paper and started writing what I thought. 'I just hope people might leave me alone for once. I don't know why they do it - I think it's just me. They started saying stuff, saying I'm small and saying I'm gay.' Connor's mother Francine Williams (left) said: 'It broke my heart when he sent me the video. He keeps coming home from school upset - he used to love school. Now he's had a lot of people telling him how brave he is' Response: Staff at Montgomery High School in Blackpool have now been made aware of the video and have promised to put a stop to the problem. Headteacher Simon Brennand said: 'We are offering support' Connor's mother Francine Williams, a network engineering graduate, said: 'It broke my heart when he sent me the video. He keeps coming home from school upset - he used to love school. 'He's had a lot of people who've seen the video, telling him how brave he is. 'He's showing others they can speak out. The school has been quite helpful. They've spoken to me and it seems like they want things to change. 'He did come across a bit of problems when he was in primary school but he was able to show them how good he was when he did shows and he managed to win them over. Connor said: 'I don't know why they do it. I just hope people might leave me alone for once' 'It took a while for him to gain their respect. 'Now, he tries to hide what he does because it just makes him a target . 'There are no after-school dance clubs that he can join at school so he can meet like-minded kids and make it more acceptable. 'I did choose this high school because they had a good anti-bullying policy because I was scared that this would happen to Connor. 'Connor was dancing from being tiny, before he could walk he would be shaking his bum and then when he started walking he would dance about, listening to Christina Aguilera. 'As he got older it was Connor who asked if he could start dance classes. At first he went to street dance but then he got picked for the Primary Steps programme and we decided he should concentrate on that. 'He just loves to dance and wants to be on stage when he's older. He is a born entertainer. 'Connor is such a brilliant dancer. There is no way he will give it up for the bullies.' Ms Williams added she was pleased with the school's response, but felt more could have been done when bullying problems were reported previously. Connor's school said it was not aware of the latest incident until the video was brought to the attention of staff. Simon Brennand, headteacher of Montgomery High School, said: 'The school has got a robust policy to minimise bullying. 'It is a really high priority issue for us. Senior staff met with the pupil and his parents on Friday morning about the issue, which previously had not been brought to the attention of Montgomery staff. 'We are offering support. We would always encourage students and parents to share issues as soon as possible to enable them to be resolved. 'We care deeply about our young people - it matters to us that they feel happy and content.' For information or help on how to beat bullies visit bullying.co.uk.

"Police in Mexico have discovered almost 50 kilos of cannabis stuffed into a shipment of sombreros heading for Chicago. Around 100 packets of the illegal drug were found rolled into coils and hidden in the crowns of the hats during a raid on a courier warehouse. Officers had received an anonymous tip-off which led them to couriers in the city of Tlaquepaque, in the western Mexican State of Jalisco, where they found the packages ready for shipping. Hidden surprise: Mexican police officers found packages of cannabis in the crowns of the straw hats headed for an address in Chicago . The drug traffickers had also packed coffee grounds and cinnamon with the drugs to disguise the smell  so they would not be detected by sniffer dogs. But border guards searching the warehouse noticed that the sombreros seemed to be unusually heavy and quickly discovered the  hats' hidden surprise. Now Mexican and US police agencies are investigating to discover the sender and recipient of the drugs. A spokesman for Mexico's Agency of Criminal Investigation said: 'There were four large boxes which were used to hide 100 packages of cannabis all of which have now been seized and will be destroyed. 'At this stage we are still investigating how long this has been going on and looking to see where else the sombreros have been sent.

"Jonathan Ross, whose return to BBC Radio 2 covering the Steve Wright show, has drawn 100 complaints . It is more than six years since he disgraced himself when he crudely mocked Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs and his family on air. And it seems many Radio 2 listeners have yet to forgive Jonathan Ross for the outrage. When the 54-year-old presenter stood in to host two music and chat shows, he drew 100 complaints. Ross had been hired to cover the afternoon show last Friday and again on Monday while Steve Wright was on holiday. But some listeners wondered what he was doing back on the airwaves. In 2008, Ross used an appearance on comedian Russell Brand’s Radio 2 show to leave obscene messages on Sachs’s answering machine. The incident provoked 42,000 complaints after Brand boasted of sleeping with the actor’s granddaughter Georgina and joked that the Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls. Brand later resigned and Ross, who had his own regular Radio 2 show, was suspended for 12 weeks. He subsequently moved to ITV, while the BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom for the shameful episode. Listeners questioned the choice of Ross to stand-in for Wright. One wrote on Twitter: ‘All is forgiven then? Didn’t think @wossy would ever “darken” hallowed BBC premises again.’ Another posted: ‘And Jonathan Ross is on BBC Radio 2 hosting a show because? My God, just shows you can get away with anything and still asked back. Shameful!’ Others said they had switched their radios off, with one tweeting: ‘Disgrace they let this clown back on radio. Never again please.’ Although Ross – who left the BBC in 2010 after it decided not to renew his £18million contract – has said he feels ‘immense regret’, the Sachs family have refused to forgive him and claimed he used the publicity to advance his career. Last night Sachs’s wife Melody said of Ross: ‘I think it’s dreadful that he’s back at the BBC. I don’t like it because of what he did to us. They carry on regardless. He’s never off the box now, is he? ‘He can do what he likes – walk over anybody, say what he likes. I just put it out of my mind and can’t be bothered any more. 'But I’m careful to switch the TV or radio off when he’s on. It’s not very nice, especially the way Andrew’s worked all his life for the BBC on radio and TV. It’s an absolute insult, really.’ In 2008, Ross used an appearance on comedian Russell Brand’s Radio 2 show to leave obscene messages on Andrew Sachs’s answering machine. His wife Melody says it is dreadful he is back on the BBC . Ross will cover another ten shows for Wright next month. The presenter, who has also been guest on Radio 4 panel show Just A Minute since his fall from grace, hosted Wright’s show for four days over the August bank holiday weekend last year, for which he was paid an estimated £4,000. Last night a Radio 2 spokesman said: ‘Jonathan is an experienced and talented broadcaster... and was very popular with our audience. 'He returned to Radio 2 last year for four days and following the warm welcome he received from the listeners, he will cover for Steve Wright in March.’","Jonathan Ross returned to Radio 2 to cover Steve Wright's afternoon show .

"A study has revealed that up to ten million gallons of ‘missing oil’ from the 2010 BP disaster has been discovered at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. The explosion at BP's Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers, injured 17 more and caused nearly 50,000 barrels of oil per day to spew into the gulf. Now a study has revealed that a huge deposit of the oil, the whereabouts of which had eluded the US government, is sitting on the sea bed. It is feared the discovery heralds long-term bad news for the environment in the area. Scroll down for video . Experts say up to ten million gallons of ‘missing oil’ from the 2010 BP disaster (pictured) has been discovered at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . Between six and ten million gallons are thought to be buried in sediment on the Gulf floor – about 62 miles southeast of the Mississippi Delta, USA Today reports. The findings were revealed after a study carried out by oceanography experts at Florida State University. Cbsnews quotes the study’s lead researcher, Jeff Chanton, as saying: ‘This is going to affect the Gulf for years to come. ‘Fish will likely ingest contaminants because worms ingest the sediment, and fish eat the worms. It's a conduit for contamination into the food web.’ The website reports that researchers extracted 62 sediment samples from an area surrounding the Deepwater Horizon site covering 9,266 sq miles. The explosion at BP's Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers, injured 17 more and caused nearly 50,000 barrels of oil per day to spew into the gulf . The well went unplugged for nearly three months after the explosion on April 20, 2010, damaging fishing and tourism as well as marine and wildlife habitats . Samples without the radioactive isotope carbon-14 show that oil is present. The information gathered was then used to create a map of the areas affected. Cbsnews says researchers found that an area of about 3,243 sq miles was covered with oil from the disaster. It is not yet clear how the crude deposits descended to the sea bed but one theory is that oil particles may have clumped together. This could have happened at the water's surface or in the plumes from the underwater leak, the researchers said. Another theory is that ash and black carbon created when cleanup crews were burning patches of oil may have sunk. The well went unplugged for nearly three months after the explosion on April 20, 2010, damaging fishing and tourism as well as marine and wildlife habitats. BP has questioned the researchers’ methods for calculating carbon derived from oil claiming ‘their estimates of the amount deposited on the sea floor are not supported by the data in their paper.’ A spokesman said: ‘Instead of using rigorous chemical analysis to identify oil in sediments, the authors used a tracer common to all sources of oil, including oil from the Gulf’s numerous natural seeps. ‘Further, only three of their 62 sediment samples had evidence of excess petrocarbon when compared to pre-spill sediment samples.’ The spokesman added that government experts had found that one per cent of sediment samples taken after August 3, 2010 ‘exceeded EPA aquatic life benchmarks for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and only those within 3 kilometers of the wellhead were consistent with Macondo oil.’","Explosion at Deepwater Horizon killed 11 workers and injured 17 others .

"Hi-tech thieves are simply driving off with cars and vans after bypassing security devices by attacking onboard computers (file picture, posed by model) Increasing numbers of top-of-the-range vehicles are being stolen every day by thieves who simply drive off after bypassing security devices by hacking onboard computers. Gangs using ‘keyless’ techniques are estimated to have stolen more than 6,000 vehicles in London alone last year – almost half of all cars and vans stolen. Most of the vehicles are broken down within hours before being loaded on to containers and shipped to Eastern Europe and Africa. Top-of-the-range BMWs and Range Rovers, as well as Ford Fiestas, Transit and Mercedes Sprinter vans, make up 70 per cent of all vehicles stolen in this way. Four-wheel-drive vehicles such as Range Rovers are among the most commonly targeted because they can be used in countries with poor roads. One technique involves breaking into the vehicle and plugging a laptop into the hidden diagnostic socket used by garages to detect and solve faults. Once connected the thieves can access the vehicle’s electronic information, allowing them to drive it away. In some cases criminals have intercepted the remote ‘lock’ signal as the owner walks away, allowing them easy access to the vehicle. The theft can sometimes take as little as ten seconds, with some vehicles then fetching £10,000 on the black market. The trend threatens to destroy years of falling car crime figures as manufacturers create more secure vehicles. In London, police chiefs are so concerned at the surge that they have launched a week-long crackdown to try and catch those responsible red-handed. Investigators have discovered the vehicles are driven to remote locations in the Home Counties where they are stripped down. They are then loaded into shipping containers and exported to clients in Africa, Cyprus, Eastern Europe, the U.S. and even Malaysia and Burma. Some of the car theft rings are so sophisticated they can steal a car and get it out of the country in less than an hour. Most of the thefts take place between 10pm and 4am between Sundays and Thursdays, when the owner is least likely to return to the vehicle. Top-of-the-range  Range Rovers, as well as Ford Fiestas, Transit and Mercedes Sprinter vans, make up 70 per cent of all vehicles stolen. Most of the vehicles are broken down within hours just hours after being taken . Detective Chief Superintendent Carl Bussey, from the Met Police, said car owners must wise up to the risk of their brand new car being stolen. He said: ‘We believe that organised crime groups using this technique are responsible for the theft of thousands of vehicles in London. ‘Many of those that we have already arrested in connection with keyless vehicle theft have previous links to other types of serious crime. ‘These people currently view keyless vehicle theft as a low-risk, high-return crime, with the most valued motor engines fetching anything up to £1,000 when sold on the black market, and entire vehicles making up to £10,000.’ Last year 90,000 vehicles were stolen in Britain and the authorities believe and many of these will have been exported. Experts are concerned that thieves may even be using computer malware to take over vehicle systems via satellite, issuing remote commands for them to unlock and start up. BMWs are also among the high-end vehicles being targeted by criminals across the country (file picture) Many devices can be bought cheaply online, often from websites based in Bulgaria. They are accompanied by video tutorials posted online. The problem was first exposed several years ago in certain models, but police now suspect that all modern makes are potentially vulnerable. Police advise car owners to leave their cars in well-lit areas, to consider using steering, gear shift and pedal locks, as well as tracking devices. Mike Hawes, of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders Limited, called on the Government to introduce stronger regulation to prevent vehicle diagnostic equipment falling into the wrong hands. He said: ‘The challenge remains that some forms of keyless theft involve equipment legitimately available to workshops for routine repairs and servicing, and a small minority of individuals are exploiting this to access vehicles illegally.’","Thieves stealing more than 17 prestige vehicles every day in 'car hacking'

"Compared to the deep snow that has blanketed much of the North, the South experienced little more than a few flurries yesterday. Yet dozens of schools in the region decided to close or open late ‘because of the weather’. And commuters across the country were hit by road and rail chaos – even in places that had received the lightest of dustings. Irate travellers said it was a joke that a few snowflakes could bring the country ‘to its knees’. One-year-old Max Beamer held his mother's hand as he experienced his first taste of snow during a walk in Whitby, North Yorkshire yesterday . Little Max throws his first snowball during his walk around Whitby, which was hit by roughly eight inches of snow yesterday . In Surrey, eight schools were closed due to the snow while three were shut in Buckinghamshire, two in Hampshire and another in Berkshire. Among them was Crondall Primary School near Farnham, which told parents in an online message that staff were ‘having difficulty travelling in from outside of the area’. Twelve miles away, Oakwood Infant School in Hartley Wintney blamed its partial closure on ‘lack of heating in the main building’. Dozens of other schools opened later than usual to accommodate pupils and staff held up on icy roads.

On Monday night, an average of 1 - 3cm (0.3 - 1in) of snow fell in Southern England. It was up to 8cm (3in) in the North. A further 2cm was expected in the South last night. No doubt, rail and road travellers will be hoping yesterday’s morning misery won’t be repeated. Signalling problems, broken-down trains and congestion hit the railways, especially in the South East. Some trains were cancelled, while others were delayed on routes including the West Coast Mainline between Northampton and London Euston. Many passengers blamed snow but Network Rail insisted this was not the case. Last night a spokesman said: ‘There have been no significant weather-related delays on the network today.’ Union leaders blamed cuts in maintenance for the problems, which have hit rail services since the start of the year.

Irate commuters aid it was a joke that a few snowflakes could bring the country ‘to its knees’ after road and rails were hit by travel chaos . On the roads there were 7,096 separate congestion hotspots by 8.50am, causing 5,135 miles of tailbacks and 699 hours of delay, according to TomTom Traffic. Many motorists took to social media to vent their annoyance. Ed Hayward from Buckinghamshire tweeted: ‘Can’t believe that 2 inches of snow brings High Wycombe’s traffic system to its knees.’ Another commuter near Horsham, West Sussex, wrote: ‘The three flakes of snow that have fallen on the A281 have created traffic chaos.’ Two crashes on the A34 and M25 caused huge delays during rush hour, and the AA said it had rescued 43 stranded cars by noon. This was despite gritters being out in force on the main roads and motorways, which are run by the Highways Agency. However many local roads leading to them — which are the responsibility of councils — were untreated, causing log-jams and a string of crashes. London Underground was also in chaos during rush hour, with some passengers stranded for hours after a signal failure hit three of the busiest Tube lines. Forecasters predict a new band of freezing cold air will blow in from central Europe on Friday. Today is expected to be a cold and largely dry day with some sleet and snow in the East, according to Meteogroup.

"A French airline is offering business-class flights for nearly £1,000 less than its competitors. La Compagnie announced yesterday it would be selling return tickets from London to New York for as little as £1,549. The same business-class flight on British Airways and Virgin would cost from around £2,365. Bob Atkinson from the TravelSupermarket website said: ‘This is a bargain. They are offering business class at Ryanair prices. ‘The trade-off for business travellers is flexibility [on dates] and the ability to move from one flight to another. But it’s great for leisure travellers wanting a business-class-style experience without the cost.’ French airline La Compagnie announced it would be selling seats on its business class-only flights between London and New York for as much as £1,000 less than its rivals . Tickets start from as little as £1,549 - with the first 500 customers getting them for even less thanks to a special offer . La Compagnie, which launched in 2013, will begin the business-class-only flights between London Luton Airport and New York on April 24. The first 500 passengers will get the flights even cheaper – with an introductory offer of £1,007 return for two people and £649 for solo travellers. Flights went on sale yesterday, and the airline will run four weekly flights, going up to six by the end of the year. They aren’t the cheapest way to cross the Atlantic – Norwegian Airlines offers one-way tickets from London Gatwick to New York’s JFK from £150 but it’s not business class. In La Compagnie’s two Boeing 757-200s, which seat up to 74, passengers can expect 26in-wide seats (66cm), compared with 17.5in in economy on most Boeing 747s. The French airline’s seats also recline to a fully flat bed, and each passenger will have use of a personal Samsung Galaxy tablet with a 12in screen, preloaded with films, TV shows, music and books. The flight menus have been created by renowned French chef Christophe Langrée, and – of course – champagnes and wines are on the drinks list. Passengers will also be given an ‘amenity kit’ by French cosmetics brand Caudalie.

The women will wear culotte shorts while the men will have knitted ties. There are few luggage restrictions, with passengers able to take two pieces weighing up to 32kg each for no extra cost. However, the transatlantic route has proved a tricky one for airlines to make profitable. Four business-class airlines – Silverjet, Eos, MAXjet and L’Avion, which was also started by La Compagnie founder Frantz Yvelin – have come and gone. But Mr Yvelin says La Compagnie is using more economical jets. He added: ‘My salary is smaller than any of my captains’ salaries; our offices are in a suburb of Paris rather than an impressive address in the city centre.’","La Compagnie to charge as little as £1,549  on business class-only flights .

"Drug addicts should be given free heroin and not be regarded as criminals, one of the country’s most senior police officers said last night. Mike Barton said addicts deserve support and police could not ‘arrest our way out of the problem’. Outspoken: Mike Barton's campaign for drug reform has been widely critcised. He says police can not ‘arrest our way out of the problem’ Durham's Chief Constable advocated giving registered addicts the drug and letting them take it under supervision in a ‘consumption room’. Writing for the Huffington Post website, he said: ‘Their entrapment in criminal justice is a waste of police time and the state’s money and dissuades addicts from revealing themselves for treatment for fear of criminal consequences. 'Police should continue to tackle drug dealers.’ The comments are the latest salvo in his campaign for drug reform, which has been widely criticised.

"It seems The Duchess of York may be looking for some romantic inspiration in the run-up to Valentine's Day. Sarah  attended the Contemporary British Love Poetry book launch at the iconic Fortnum & Mason store in London on Tuesday night, where she mingled with the volume's editor Greta Bellamacina and studied the poems closely. The 55-year-old drew attention to her slim-line figure in a black trench coat drawn tightly in at the waist, which she accessorised with simple earrings. Scroll down for video . Sarah Ferguson kept her look simple and elegant in a black trench coat and ballet pumps . Fergie chatted animatedly with young poet Greta Bellamacina, who edited the volume of love poetry . Clearly a fan of Greta's work, the Duchess was seen asking her to autograph a book of poetry for her . Keeping the look chic and simple, she paired the coat, which sported large gold buttons, with black ballet pumps and wore her hair loose round her shoulders. The former royal, chatted animatedly with Greta Bellamacina, who looked glamorous in a floor length Thirties-style gown with a plunging neckline. The blonde beauty, who recently graduated from King's College London, has already made waves in literary circles. Having studied English Language and communication, Greta, who is blessed with model-like looks, has already published her first book and worked for Dolce & Gabbana, All Saints and Sienna Miller's line Twenty8Twelve as an in-house poet. Clearly a fan of Greta's work, the Duchess was seen asking her to autograph the book of poetry for her. She also chatted with artist and 'it girl' Isabella Cotier at the event, which launched the book Contemporary British Love Poetry.

At one point Sarah seemed to be reading aloud from the volume to Isabella Cotier, who illustrated the book. The Fortnum & Mason website described the collection: 'From dark love to first love, love lost to love regained, the collection is a comprehensive study of the many facets of love, and the feelings we associate with it.' Perhaps the subject has been on her mind recently as the Duchess appeared on US television last month to defend her ex-husband Prince Andrew, with whom she enjoys a famously good relationship. While appearing on the NBC morning Today show, to promote a soup-making kit to help weight-loss, Sarah stood up for Prince Andrew against allegations that he had sexual relations with an underage girl, allegations which Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace have strongly denied. The Duchess described him as a 'humongously good man' and 'my best friend and my best ex-husband ever'. Sarah Ferguson passionately defended her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, when she appeared on the Today show in America . 'I won't stand by - because I know what it feels like to have salacious lies made up about you - and not support him so publicly,' she told Matt Lauer. 'I won't stand by and have his character defamed,' she said. 'I will not have one word said about him on any level. Any level.'

"A Georgia police officer stopped at a fire station to get help delivering his wife's baby when the couple realized they weren't going to reach hospital in time. Jeremy Massengill, of Dunwoody, said that his wife, Jennifer, would 'yell at little louder' at each red light - and that's when he decided they needed to stop, as the drama unfolded on Sunday.

"Children with genetic material from three parents could be born from next year, after MPs voted to legalise the controversial technique. In a highly-charged debate yesterday, critics warned there was ‘no going back’ from allowing a couple to use an egg donor’s DNA to prevent genetic disease. But MPs voted by 382 to 128 for the procedure after hearing it could be the ‘light at the end of a very dark tunnel’ for families blighted by incurable conditions. Hope: Vicky Holliday and Keith Newell with their one-year-old daughter Jessica . These diseases, such as muscular dystrophy, affect one in 6,500 and are passed down in the mother’s mitochondria, the ‘batteries’ that power the body’s cells. British scientists devised the new IVF technique, in which the child has genetic material from three people, but does not inherit any of the donor’s characteristics. The UK would be the first country to legalise the procedure. Opponents include the Church of England, Catholic Church, Human Genetics Alert, Christian Medical Fellowship, Society for the Protection of Unborn Children and Islamic Medical Association UK. They say permanently altering a person’s genetic make-up has huge ethical consequences and raises concerns about a slippery slope to designer babies. But supporters, including the Prime Minister, said it will give couples who have endured repeatedly miscarrying, or burying their children, the option of a healthy family. British scientists devised the new IVF technique, in which the child has genetic material from three people, but does not inherit any of the donor’s characteristics. Opponents include the Church of England . David Cameron said: ‘As someone who has had the experience of having a severely disabled child [Ivan, who died six years ago] I have every sympathy with those parents. 'The people arguing that we are fiddling with nature in a profound way, I think are quite wrong. We are not playing God, we are just making sure that all parents who want a healthy baby can have one.’ The House of Lords is expected to back the change later this month. Applications would then have to be approved by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, but it is expected the first child could be born using the technique by the end of 2016. Many MPs – 81 Tories, 31 Labour and five Lib Dems – had ethical and safety concerns, including Justice Secretary Chris Grayling who voted against the procedure. Tory MP Fiona Bruce said the move was a ‘red line MPs should not cross’, adding: ‘The implications simply cannot be predicted, but one thing is for sure: Once this alteration has taken place… there will be no going back.’ 'You're quite sure you just want to buy the one Mother's Day card?' Labour MP Rob Flello said the technique had not been sufficiently tested and that families could suffer ‘tragic outcomes’. He said the US and China had banned similar techniques due to safety concerns. Tory Sir Edward Leigh, a prominent Catholic, asked: ‘Where do we stop?’ But Andrew Miller, chairman of the Commons Science and Technology Committee, which held an inquiry into the procedure, said the fears were ‘ill-founded’. Trials led scientists to ‘conclude that the risks are small but worth taking because the benefits … are enormous’, he said. Health minister Jane Ellison told MPs that the DNA in mitochondria accounts for only 0.054 per cent of a person’s overall DNA and none of their characteristics. She added: ‘Not only would children born through such techniques be free of these conditions, but so would their children … breaking a chain of misery that would have ruined generations of lives.’ Miss Ellison assured MPs that the procedure would be subject to ‘robust’ regulation. Last night Newcastle University’s Professor Doug Turnbull, who pioneered the procedure, said he was ‘delighted’. His patient Vicky Holliday, 38, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, hopes to have the treatment. The management consultant’s daughter, Jessica, one, suffers from Leigh syndrome, which means she is likely to die within a few years. ‘It would mean so much to us to be able to have a healthy child,’ Miss Holliday said. ‘Mitochondrial disease is unimaginably cruel.’ But the Church of England argues it is ‘irresponsible’ to pursue the move before more research, and the Catholic Church is opposed to artificial insemination. Lawyer Cara Nuttall, of Slater & Gordon, said: ‘The law needs to deal with expectations of the donor and recipients, and make clear their legal status to any resulting child.’ I LOOK AT MY DAUGHTER AND WELCOME THIS, BY IAN BIRRELL . Given the immense medical and moral significance of the issue, it was curious that MPs were given only 90 minutes to debate a law which would allow the creation of babies from two mothers and one father. For as public health minister Jane Ellison told the Commons, this is a bold step to take, involving world-beating science. But it is also one with deep global implications. Despite alarmist opposition over ‘three-parent children’, we already have more than two parents contributing biologically to the birth of children, with the use of egg donation and surrogacy . Britain has become the first country in the world to endorse this extraordinary genetic innovation, developed largely at Newcastle University, which involves mitochondrial replacement – healthy DNA from one woman being inserted into embryos from another. This is particularly controversial since it means that genetic material will be carried by the newborn child and can be passed down future generations. Not surprisingly, it has provoked fears that hidden side-effects could emerge in future years. But I strongly believe it was the right decision to take after an unusually exhaustive consultative process that does credit to our country, with three separate independent reviews over seven years. Crucially, the process does not impinge on the very complex nuclear DNA which contains the 23,000 genes that define the characteristics of a child. And despite alarmist opposition over ‘three-parent children’, we already have more than two parents contributing biologically to the birth of children, with the use of egg donation and surrogacy. Indeed, it could be argued that there are ‘four’ genetic parents involved when anyone is given an organ transplant – another modern medical intervention that highlights how science is constantly improving and extending the lives of human beings. Prime Minister David Cameron supported the move and said: ‘As someone who has had the experience of having a severely disabled child [Ivan, who died six years ago] I have every sympathy with those parents . Back in the 1970s, critics also opposed the introduction of in-vitro fertilisation, with similar emotive talk of doctors ‘playing God’ and potentially lethal consequences. But by the time the first ‘test-tube baby’ Louise Brown turned 21, such techniques had become routine, with 300,000 more people born by the process around the world. As the parent of a child born in the early 1990s with complex disabilities due to a rare genetic disorder, I can understand the pain of families forced to watch children suffer neurological conditions that could now be avoided. I still suffer agonies seeing my daughter scream as she suffers epileptic seizures, tears forming in her eyes as she thrashes around. Although she is 21 and adorable, it still cuts to my core knowing she will never walk, talk or feed herself. Some parents have seen a succession of children die in infancy or childhood due to faulty mitochondria – which can cause similar cases of complex epilepsy, as well as devastating conditions such as muscular dystrophy and even catastrophic organ failure. Only one in 6,500 children develop these more serious disorders. Now, if the change in regulation is approved by the House of Lords, such children will gain the chance to live a full life. Yet while I welcome this advance, one critical MP yesterday asked where do we stop? And he was right to pose this question, for there are moral questions that even this mild form of genetic engineering raises. Some smug scientists now talk in excitable terms of eliminating all disabilities and, rather sinisterly, of ‘enhancing evolution’. This has been described as ‘back-door eugenics’ – the wiping out of certain types of people through medical advances. This would certainly be dangerous in a society that still excludes far too many people with disabilities from mainstream life and which aborts a rising number of children on grounds of an often comparatively minor disorder such as Down’s syndrome. So even as I praise yesterday’s sensible decision, we still have to deal with the implications of this brave new world. However amazing these medical advances are, they also raise profound issues going to the heart of human existence. Some parents see a succession of children die in infancy or childhood due to faulty mitochondria – which can cause similar cases of complex epilepsy, as well as devastating conditions such as muscular dystrophy .","Children with genetic material from 3 parents could be born from next year .

"Kate Winslet has said her two divorces have taught her children valuable life lessons - but not all parents would agree. Her comments sparked a heated debate on ITV's This Morning, with women with entirely opposing views battle it out over the question of whether divorce can ever be good for children. The question has also been hotly discussed on online parenting forums since the star told Harper's Bazaar: 'I think it’s very important to teach your children to struggle on some level.' Scroll down for video . Kate Winslet has spoke about how the bad points in her life, including her two divorces, have helped teach her kids about hardships . Mum-of-two, Sally Jones, said divorce should never be an option as it's so damaging for children. But mum-of-one, Alley Einstein, disagreed . The actress, 39,  has three children: Mia, 14, from her marriage to Jim Threapleton, Joe, 11, from her marriage to Sam Mendes and one-year-old, Bear, from her third husband Ned Rocknroll. She spoke out in the March issue of Harper's Bazaar, which hit shelves today, saying: 'I would honestly say that I wouldn’t change a thing. Even all the bad bits. 'It doesn’t matter how ***** times have been, they all matter, because those things shape who you are. 'And if you don’t like who you are, well, then you’re ****** really, aren’t you?' Appearing on This Morning, mum-of-two, Sally Jones, slammed the star's views on divorce and referred to her statements as 'emotional incontinence'. ‘She somehow thinks that just because she wants to go off with somebody else it doesn’t matter to anybody else – the children can come in my wake and I'm just going to say it's fine for them. Marriage one: The Titanic actress married director Jim Threapleton in 1998. They had a daughter, Mia, before divorcing in 2001 . 'She’s got no idea how it’s going to affect them.' But mother-of-one Alley Einstein, who joined Ms Jones on the sofa interjected. ‘Of course she has – she knows a child wants to see their mummy and daddy happy,' she said. 'My parents should have got divorced but they never did. Parents who live together and stay together because of their children are living a lie. 'They’re simply saying mummy and daddy are going to stay together for you but we really aren’t happy. 'Simply staying together for sake of children is wrong.' But undeterred, Ms Jones continued: 'Plenty of marriages people go through a bad time – especially if don’t have army of nannies and gardeners.' But she says rather than 'stick on a stiff upper lip' they opt for divorce. 'Many times my husband and I have wanted to strangle each other, ' she admitted. Marriage two: The actress next walked down the aisle with director Sam Mendes and had a son, Jo. They split in 2010 . Marriage three: The star then tied the knot with Richard Branson's nephew Ned Rocknroll in 2012 and they welcomed a son, Bear, the following year . 'But children long and long to see their parents together. ‘Kids have plenty of struggles – kids of happily married couples have struggles. There's no point making extra struggles. But Ms Jones added: 'Obviously if there's violence or bullying – that's something different.' Parenting expert Noel Janis-Norton author of Calmer, Easier, Happier Parenting said the question of divorce is never black and white. ‘On the one hand children want their parents to stay together - unless it is a truly horrendous situation. Parents who aired their views on parenting forum Netmums were not all as understanding of Kate's views . One daughter of divorced parents takes a stance against Kate's statements . ‘Children want that dream of perfection', she told the MailOnline. ‘But in reality some families benefit from divorce. ‘The most troubled dysfunctional families I’ve seen in my career are the ones where biological parents are staying together for sake of children. ‘Children will never thank their parents for that.’ The star's interview created a backlash on parenting forum Netmums . Some Netmums users supported Kate Winslet's view . But parents who aired their views on parenting forum Netmums were not all as understanding. 'Unless it's an abusive relationship it's not a positive experience for children. How about teaching them to resolve problems etc? Children need to learn life's not always easy but there are many ways,' posted Emma. The March issue of Harper's Bazaar contains the full interview . Another mum, Kate wrote: 'No I don't think it is good or helpful to children at all. I wouldn't think that highly of someone who had been married to 3 men had a child each to each husband and been divorced 3 times. how is that a good example to her children?!' 'Is there a remote chance that this is anything other than self justifying nonsense?' wrote Faith. Another netmum user Danni said: 'I don't think its fair to judge on different children with different fathers at all, but as someone who experienced my parents divorce when I was young I can say it didn't help at all and I completely disagree. But thats just my opinion.' But alongside the criticism also came some support. One mother Jo posted: 'My children have a much better relationship with their father now we are divorced than they ever did when we were married. 'Now he actually has to spend time with them doing things that he just left up to me before. I just wish he had been like this when we were together!' Lisa Marie then added: I don't know that I would go so far as to say that divorce is a good thing for children. but in some cases it can be far better than if the parents stay together.'

"Millions of young children dreamed about being Ariel while watching the Disney film as a child, but few did much more than request the doll on their Christmas list. But for some, the appeal of a mermaid is clearly much stronger. The annual Merfest convention in Cary, North Carolina, saw over 300 men and women come together to celebrate being mermaids last month. Scroll down for video . The annual Merfest in North Carolina sees hundreds of people come together to celebrate being 'merfolk' Attendees took workshops on underwater modelling and how to hold their breath, and also swam with Hannah Fraser, a professional mermaid and environmental activist. The event is not for the fair-weather mermaid fan, with die-hard merfolk spending up to £2,500 ($4000) on their colourful tails, which can be made to feel as close to fish scales as possible. Putting on a tail requires a lot of effort, so a lot of the merfolk have a mertender - a spouse or friend - to assist them in an out of their tails at poolside. Not only do these mertenders help their own mermaid or merman, they often help the others around them, by using a lubricant like coconut oil. This year's event saw over 300 men and women gather at a swimming pool for the event . 'Merfolk' can spend up to £2500 ($4000) on their colourful tails . As well as their tails, enthusiasts adorn themselves with wigs, tiaras and of course the classic shell bra . It is near impossible to put your own tail on so each mermaid has their own mertender, a person who assists them into their costume using lubricant and coconut oil . Sean Norman, a mertender, says that the act of getting your scales on is anything but glamorous. He said: 'It's tricky getting some of these tails on. They're kind of grippy on the skin and it's an awkward situation. 'You can't look graceful getting into these things, so what I try to do is just help out a little bit and ease that moment of frustration so you can get to the fun part.' The unusual event was all captured on camera by photographer Arthur Drooker, 60 from California, who took the pictures as part of his book Conventional Wisdom, which sees him travel around unconventional conventions around the US. The act of getting scales on is anything but glamorous . Merfest is a place for those with fully formed and fledgling mersonas, where they can foster this personality without fear of being judged by their own family . Arthur, who has been a keen photographer since he was 15, said: 'For a lot of them, the desire to be a mermaid was spawned in childhood after seeing a movie, reading a book, going to the beach or an aquarium. 'They embodied an idealised self: a beautiful, graceful and confident person.' Arthur says that as well as dressing the part, the convention gives merfolk the freedom to take on their own mermaid character. 'To emulate a mermaid, one developed a mersona, akin to the personality of a mermaid or merman.' This year's Merfest saw the first wedding - between Cookie Ramirez and her mertender, Ralph de Jesus . He continued: 'Merfest is a place for those with fully formed and fledgling mersonas, where they can foster this personality without fear of being judged by their own family.' This year's Merfest saw the first wedding - between Cookie Ramirez and her mertender, Ralph de Jesus. Cookie, who describes herself as a 'mermaid through and through' - wore a shiny tail while Ralph donned a tuxedo T-shirt and black swim trunks. Well-wishers splashed their tails to congratulate the happy couple as the ceremony came to an end. The happy groom says that Cookie's mermaid persona has given her a new lease of life. Merfest sees a people empowered by their transformations . People's demeanors completely change once they put on their tail . 'Ever since Cookie got involved with merfolk, I've seen a difference in her. 'I see her when she gets into the water, she just floats and you see the smile on her face and that's what brings me enjoyment. 'She totally changes when she puts on that tail.' Arthur added that he had also noticed a change in Cookie's demeanor when she wore her special fins. He said: 'Like many merfolk, Cookie feels transformed when she puts on her tail. 'For her, being a mermaid is a position of freedom and creativity and it's broadened her perspective on life. 'There's empowerment in the transformation and everyone at Merfest feels nurtured by it.'","The annual Merfest takes place in Cary, North Carolina .

"House Speaker John Boehner teared up on Tuesday as he led a ceremony to award a special band of World War II solders the Congressional Gold Medal. About 200 people attended the award ceremony to honor the 1st Special Force - also known as the Devil's Brigade - including about 40 remaining members of the elite group of American and Canadian soldiers. 'These men saved the free world,' Rep Boehner, R-Ohio, said at the Tuesday event where he was pictured wiping away tears from his face. Scroll down for video .

The legendary special force was tasked with creating havoc behind enemy lines through sabotage and slaughter and laid the foundation for the U.S. navy SEALS and the modern day special forces in Canada. The troop were so feared by the Nazis that they earned the nickname the 'Devil's Brigade' because of their painted faces and stealth tactics. On Tuesday, Devil's Brigade veteran Eugene Guttierez Jr, of Texas, accepted the Gold Medal on behalf of his comrades, living and passed. 'Guess what? They delivered,' he said, as he accepted the highest Congressional honor for  civilians. Guttierez enlisted in the Army in 1941 and went on to fight with the Devil's Brigade in the coastal city of Anzio, Italy before helping liberate Rome. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the brigade members 'heroes' who 'helped free the world of tyranny'. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, also weighed in to toast the brigade's special set of skills that helped secure Allied victory.

Heroes: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (second right) called the brigade 'heroes' who 'helped free the world of tyranny' Ceremony: The event was attended by about 200 at the Congressional Visitors Center, including about 40 veterans of the 1st Special Forces . 'They advanced on skis and through the air. They survived by stealth and trained in demolitions. Some of their more daring mission plans would have made James Bond blush,' McConnell said. 'But this isn't just some Hollywood script,' he said. 'It's a true story about a fearless group of young Canadians and Americans...who were willing to put their lives on the line in the truest sense of the term. Through it all, they helped save a continent in chaos.' Behind enemy lines: The First Special Service Force earned the nickname 'Black Devils' because they smeared their faces with boot polish and murdered Nazis in their sleep.

Pictured: Sergeant Leonard L.Grew, Privates J.F Bell, and F.A. Murphy sat in a mortar pit om Anzio, Italy . The Black Devils were formed in 1942 and the 1,800 strong force was primarily made up of volunteers who were previously lumberjacks, forest rangers, hunters and game wardens. At their base in Fort Harrison near Helena, Montana in the United States, they received rigorous and intensive training in stealth tactics, hand-to-hand combat, the use of explosives for demolition, parachuting, amphibious warfare, rock-climbing, mountain warfare, and as ski troops. They even had a specially designed fighting knife made for them called the V-42. During the war they fought across Europe, in the Aleutian Islands,  the Pacific and later in Italy and southern France before being disbanded in December 1944.

They had parachute into German-held Norway to knock out strategic targets such as hydroelectric power plants. But it  was during Operation Shingle in Anzio, Italy, in 1944 that they earned the nickname the 'Black Devil's. They were brought ashore to hold and raid the beachhead, which they did. A journal of a German officer which was found by allies, read: 'The Black Devils are all around us every time we come into the line. We never hear them come.' They were the subject of the 1968 movie, 'Devils' Brigade,' starring William Holden and Cliff Robertson and were also said to have inspire Quentin Tarantino's 2009 movie Inglorious Basterds.

"Cockroaches may be one of the most loathed creatures on the planet, but scientists claim they have personalities - and some are even 'shy'. Experts studying the insects have discovered that they have individual character traits when emerging from hiding places, with some scurrying boldly, while others seek shelter. The discovery may not make them desirable, it could go some way to explaining the cockroaches’ evolutionary success. Experts studying American cockroaches have discovered that they have individual character traits when emerging from hiding places, with some acting cautiously, and others boldly in search of food (stock image) In an experiment, scientists from Université libre de Bruxelles studied the behaviour of the insects when they came out in the open. They theorised that if cockroaches all have the same personalities they would all behave exactly the same when in the open. But their observations revealed clear differences. Isaac Planas Sitjà, one of the researchers from the university, said: ‘We have categorised the observed personalities. We call them “shy or cautious” and “bold or explorers”’. ‘Shy individuals are those that spend more time sheltered and explore less the arena or the surroundings. ‘Instead, bold individuals are those that spend most part of the time exploring the surroundings and spend less time sheltered.’ He said that his team is studying the implications of these personalities for social behaviour. Individual personalities of cockroaches (a microscope image is shown) have an impact on a group of insects. ‘Some groups quickly reach a consensus and make a collective decision, whilst other groups with conflicting personalities take longer to make a collective decision,’ Dr Sitjà said. ‘We are looking for behavioural syndromes that will help to categorise them and give more information about the existing synergies between personality and social behaviour,’ he said. After atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, rumours spread that only cockroaches survived the blasts. To test the popular myth, which was spread during the Cold War, the team behind Discovery's Mythbusters subjected cockroaches to three levels of radioactive metal cobalt 60. They started with a dose of 1,000 radon units (rads) which could kill a person in 10 minutes, then upped the dose to 10,000 - the strength of the blast at Hiroshima - and 100,000 rads for a handful of unfortunate insects. They monitored the cockroaches for 30 days, looking for signs of cellular damage. After a month, half of the insects exposed to the lowest dose were alive and 10 per cent of those exposed to 10,000 rads . The experiment seems to confirm the myth that the insects can survive a nuclear blast, although all those exposed to the highest dose of radiation perished. It's thought the cockroach’s ability to survive is because of its simple body and cell cycles, which only renew once a week, leaving radiation few opportunities to attack, compared with humans whose cells are constantly splitting. In a statement summarising their findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the research team said: ‘From studying the way they find shelter, we show that individuals have consistent behaviour which can differ between individuals in a group - cockroaches have personalities. ‘Moreover, these individual personalities have an impact both on the group personality and sheltering dynamics. ‘Some groups quickly reach a consensus and make a collective decision, while other groups with conflicting personalities take longer to make a collective decision.’ Different personalities are thought to help the survival of the species because by driving different behaviour, at least some of the group is likely to survive if disaster strikes. In the experiment, American cockroaches were fitted with radio tags to monitor their movements. The insects were kept in darkness until they were released in batches of 16 in ‘arenas’ surrounded by electrified wires to prevent them escaping. They were measured for the speed with which they found shelter and the time they spent exploring and seeking out new supplies of food. ‘Within a group, individuals consistently differed in their rate of joining the shelters and their resting time over the week,’ the researchers concluded. In their natural environment the differences in personality could improve the chances of adventurous cockroaches finding extra food but simultaneously increase their chances of being preyed on. The shy insects would be more likely to avoid predators because they spend more time under shelter but would be more prone to going hungry.","Scientists from Université libre de Bruxelles studied the behaviour of the insects when they came out in the open in an 'arena'

"Disgraced former MP Chris Huhne, who has been given a pass granting him access to Parliament despite having served a jail term . Disgraced Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne has been given a pass granting him access to Parliament two years – despite having just served a jail term for perverting the course of justice. The former Energy Secretary quit as an MP after pleading guilty to the charge, after trying to cover up the fact that he had swapped speeding points with his ex-wife, Vicky Pryce. He was sentenced to eight months in prison. Nevertheless, a Freedom of Information request has revealed he is among 360 former MPs who have been granted a Commons pass. The lucky recipients may use Westminster’s heavily subsidised bars and restaurants, as well as other facilities. Passholders include former Conservative minister Jonathan Aitken, who was jailed in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice, as well as several ex-MPs who left the House in the 2010 election following the expenses scandal. Derek Conway had the Conservative whip withdrawn and then stepped down after being heavily censured for putting his son on the public pay-roll without apparently giving him any duties. Labour’s Ben Chapman declined to stand again after it emerged he had overclaimed on his mortgage by £15,000, while his party colleague Harry Cohen had a £65,000 resettlement grant withheld to make up for wrongly claimed accommodation expenses. ‘I do not think someone who has committed a criminal offence that has meant they went to prison should get privileged access to the Houses of Parliament,’ Labour backbencher John Mann said. ‘Let them queue with the general public if they want to get in.’ He warned that the list of passholders ‘reinforces the impression that this is a gentlemen’s club’. Mr Mann also raised concerns about the potential for lobbying current MPs, as many former members who hold passes have taken up roles in the private sector. A Freedom of Information request has revealed that Mr Huhne is among among 360 former MPs who have been granted a pass for the Commons . ‘Why should people who have been beaten in an election have special privileges?’ he asked. ‘What these positions are generally used for is people making money through their parliamentary contacts.’ After leaving Parliament Mr Huhne set up a consultancy firm, Chris Huhne and Associates. He also has a two-day-a-week role as European chief of an American energy company. Ex-Labour MP Jim Devine, who was jailed for 16 months for making false expenses claims in 2011, was reported to have had a parliamentary pass that year. However, he does not feature on the list.","Former Energy Secretary served time in jail for perverting course of justice .

"A renowned Ukrainian animal expert had to have his arm amputated after being crushed by an angry elephant. Oleg Grishchenko, 39, has worked with elephants all his life and is considered one of the most knowledgeable handlers in eastern Europe. But he was caught unaware when the animal, called Tandy, became extremely and unexpectedly agitated, charging at him at a zoo in the city of Kharkov, in eastern Ukraine. Shock: Oleg Grishchenko (pictured before the attack)  was caught unaware when the elephant named Tandy charged at him. He suffered serious crush injuries and had to have his arm amputated . Friends and family have appealed for money to help Mr Grishchenko pay for his operation and take time off to come to terms with his injuries. Head of the Department of Elephants and Hippos Yuri Danilenko, 46, said: 'It all happened very quickly. God knows how exactly, it was a pure accident.' Working with elephants is notoriously dangerous and there have been many accidents and deaths in the UK and abroad involving the animals which weigh several tons. Some believe illness can make them snap, while others think small enclosures can lead to bad tempered animals suddenly cracking under the strain of captivity. Experienced: Oleg Grishchenko, 39, has worked with elephants all his life and is considered one of the most knowledgeable handlers in eastern Europe . Mr Grishchenko had been working at the zoo since 1993, without incident and was considered an expert in communicating with and understanding the animals. His injury after the elephant knocked him over and stamped on his arm was so severe that doctors were forced to amputate it at the elbow. Tandy was the first elephant born in the Ukraine when she came into the world on July 19, 1998 in Odessa Zoo.

"Millions of women worldwide endure unwanted pregnancies each year because they are fearful of modern forms of contraception, a report has claimed. In fact, 40 per cent of women who avoid contraception do so because they worry about the side effects and health implications of methods such as the Pill, coils and condoms. And almost 20 per cent don't use protection because they vastly underestimated the risk of pregnancy, the World Health Organisation study found. As a result of such attitudes, there are 15 million unwanted pregnancies worldwide each year. Scroll down for video . Unexpected: World Health Organisation figures show there are 15 million unwanted pregnancies each year . Researchers who analysed figures from 35 low and middle income countries found 15 million out of 16.7 million unwanted pregnancies a year could easily be avoided. The findings apply to a third of the global population, with many who become unintentionally pregnant facing disease, and poorer work prospects. The researchers also warned that lack of proper contraception can result in unwanted abortions. They looked at contraceptive use among 12,874 women aged 15 to 49 who became pregnant unintentionally. They compared them with 111,301 sexually active women who were neither pregnant nor wanting to be from 35 countries. The researchers then calculated the number of undesired pregnancies and the proportion that were attributable to not using modern contraception, including the Pill, male and female condoms, the coil, sterilisation and injectable contraceptives.

It was also revealed that traditional methods, including withdrawal, and trying to time sex outside the fertile period of a woman's menstrual cycle, made it 2.7 times more likely a woman would end up with an unwanted pregnancy. And using no contraception at all made it 14.5 times more likely they would end up pregnant. It was also revealed that traditional methods, including withdrawal, and trying to time sex outside the fertile period of a woman's menstrual cycle, made it 2.7 times more likely a woman would end up with an unwanted pregnancy. And using no contraception at all made it 14.5 times more likely they would end up pregnant. It was also discovered that the poorest and least well educated women were the least likely to use modern contraception. Of the 14,893 who did not use contraception and did not want to get pregnant, the main reason given for non-use was fear of side-effects and health concerns, with 5,559 women (a surprising 37 per cent) saying it put them off. Another 17.6 per cent were found to underestimate the risk of pregnancy. And 2.4 per cent said contraception was too expensive, with the same number saying they didn't know where to get contraceptives. Study author Dr Howard Sobel, from the World Health Organisation's Western Pacific Regional Office, said: 'This study has many implications. 'For instance, ""health concerns"" was the most common reason given for not using modern contraception, yet these concerns are not backed up by evidence. Worries: 40 per cent of women who had avoided contraception did so because they feared the side effects and health implications of methods such as the Pill, coils and condoms . 'Health workers have an important role to play in reassuring, educating, treating symptoms and finding the methods that best suits an individual. 'However, frontline health workers need the skills to do this, and our experience has been that many have the same misconceptions. 'We could prevent the overwhelming majority of pregnancies if we could debunk the myths and misperceptions about modern methods and use long-term methods of contraception, such as implants and intrauterine devices.' He added: 'National strategies need to be put in place to address unfounded health concerns, fear of side-effects, opposition and underestimated risk of pregnancy. 'These need to be coupled with good quality contraception that is available and affordable.' The findings were published in the journal Human Reproduction.","15m of 16.7 million unwanted pregnancies a year 'could easily be avoided'

"Sued: Billionaire Ira Rennert appeared in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday to face an $118million lawsuit . The reclusive owner of one of America's largest homes appeared in court Tuesday to face a civil lawsuit which accuses him of funneling millions of dollars out of a failing business to fund construction of the sprawling 62,000-square-foot Hamptons estate. Ira Rennert, 80, is being sued by a group of creditors to the now defunct Magnesium Corporation of America, who allege that he caused the metal company to go into bankrupt by unlawfully taking $100million for his personal use. However, Rennert's attorneys say there's no way to prove that the money went towards construction of the billionaire's palatial oceanfront estate, and argue that he can't be held responsible for the fluctuating market that prompted the downfall of MagCorp. Rennert sat in the second row on the first day of the trial in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, and watched as the 10 mostly middle-class jurors were shown pictures of his estate, named Fairfield. The elaborate  beach home boasts 29 bedrooms, 39 bathrooms, three dining rooms, three swimming pools, an 164-seat theater, basketball court, gymnasium and two-lane bowling alley. The industrial magnate, and former friend of convicted ponzi-schemer Bernie Madoff, is expected to testify at some point during the three to four week trial. Rennert's involvement with MagCorp goes all the way back to 1989, when his industrial  conglomerate Renco Group bought the metal company for $44million. Over the next six years, the company boomed thanks to an 8 per cent growth in the magnesium market. Then, in 1996, the company sold $150million in bonds, but instead of investing the profits to update technology and modernize production, creditors say the money was sent back to Renco and onto Rennert personally. Million-dollar lawsuit: Rennert is being sued by creditors of now defunct Magnesium Corporation of America, who argue that the 80-year-old funneled $100million out of the struggling company to build his Hamptons Estate (pictured above) One of the largest homes in America: The creditors say Rennert took $100million from the company and that the financial blow ultimately led the company to file for bankruptcy. Above, another aerial view of Rennert's 62,000-square-foot estate in Sagaponack named Fairfield . Amentities: On Tuesday, 10 mostly middle-class jurors were shown pictures of Rennert's estate which boasts 29 bedrooms, 39 bathrooms, three dining rooms, three swimming pools, an 164-seat theater, basketball court, gymnasium and two-lane bowling alley . The plaintiffs argue that at least $41million should have remained with MagCorp to keep the company afloat, and that Rennert knew how much the company was struggling when he cashed out the bond funds. Just five months after the alleged payday, Rennert started another company called Blue Turtles to buy land for his Hamptons estate. Two months later, Blue Tutrles acquired the massive plot of land in Sagaponack for $11million. Construction began on the property in 1998, which was estimated to cost $100million. Meanwhile, the magnesium market started to swing in 1996 and in 2001 MagCorp filed for bankruptcy. Rennert's attorneys say he is not responsible for MagCorp's bankruptcy, and that the company had enough money to make the necessary improvements. Bad business: MagCorp allegedly gave $150million to Renco in 1996, and the company's creditors say $100million was then filed onto Rennert personally . Coincidence? Less than a year later, Rennert purchased the property to build his Sagaponack, New York home . 'MagCorp was a financially strong and successful company at the time of all of the distributions in question,' a spokesman for Rennert's company told Crain's New York. 'The only way the plaintiff can get around that core issue of the case is by raising distortions and by caricaturing Mr. Rennert personally, but those distractions do not have legal substance, as our filings prove.' MagCorp's creditors are now suing for $118million which, with interest, could amount to more than $600million plus punitive damages. They charge that Rennert is guilty of fraudulent conveyance, breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. Rennert was born in Brooklyn in 1934, and went on to graduate from Brooklyn College before landing a job on Wall Street and finding financial success. In addition to his home on Long Island, he also owns an apartment at 625 Park Avenue in Manhattan and is worth an estimated $6.3billion according to Forbes.","Ira Rennert's Hamptons estate named Fairfield is one of the largest homes in America .

"Ed Miliband, pictutred, would plunge Britain into an economic catastrophe like the one facing France, a former advisor to Gordon Brown said last night . Ed Miliband would plunge Britain into an economic catastrophe like the one facing France under Francois Hollande, a former advisor to Gordon Brown said last night. Brent Hoberman, the co-founder of Lastminute.com and a member of the last Labour government’s business advisory council, warned that Mr Miliband would attempt to repeat the failed socialist experiment that has left the French economy in the doldrums. His comments follow a series of damning interventions from captains of industry who queued up yesterday to attack Labour’s economic policies and warn of the consequences if Mr Miliband enters No10 in May. As the party’s damaging row with business entered a third day, Mr Miliband came under fire from Digby Jones, trade minister under Gordon Brown. Lord Jones, the former director general of the CBI, said: ‘We cannot have political leaders who are creating the wrong sort of mood music, that says we do not like business. I don’t want to be France. I don’t want people thinking that they do not want to come here. I want business to want to be here.’ Business leader Peter Hargreaves, who co-founded the FTSE100 investment giant Hargreaves Lansdown, said a Labour government would be a disaster for the economy and cause entrepreneurs and the wealthy to flee the country. He added: ‘If the Labour Party got into power they would leave a monstrous deficit and will bankrupt the country.’ Former Chairman of Pizza Express Luke Johnson said it would be a disaster if Labour ‘carried out the policies they’re suggesting’. The former Channel 4 chairman said: ‘Take freezing energy prices – an example of how the Opposition are ignorant of the way markets and capitalism works.’ Mr Hoberman – who is now a government trade ambassador, warned that Labour’s ‘anti-business rhetoric’ was ‘scaring business’. The internet guru and tech entrepreneur said: ‘Should Labour get elected then what we may well find is that it will be similar to what Hollande did in France, in that he sends businesses away and investment out of the country and then he does a U-turn and it’s almost too late.’ Lastminute.com co-founder Brent Hoberman, left, accused Labour of 'ant-business populism'. Pizza Express founder Luke Johnson, right, said it would be a disaster if they ‘carried out the policies they’re suggesting’ He accused Labour of ‘anti-business populism’ and failing to recognise that many firms ‘contribute huge amounts’. The damaging war of words between Labour and business began on Sunday when Boots boss Stefano Pessina warned that a Labour government would be a ‘catastrophe’. Left-wing Labour MPs last night accused their party of not being radical enough and insisted they would push for ‘real Labour policies’ if Ed Miliband gets into Downing Street in a coalition. A group led by John McDonnell will meet trade unions, Left-wing academics and campaign groups this weekend to decide what their demands would be in negotiations with other parties. Mr McDonnell said: ‘Many Labour MPs, candidates and activists will want to campaign for a more radical agenda of policies than we have seen so far. ‘Many voters will also want to know that there are people within the Labour party arguing for real Labour policies.’ His comments sparked a furious response from Labour, whose business spokesman Chuka Umunna questioned Mr Pessina’s tax affairs and Labour MPs said they would not listen to a multi-millionaire who lived in ‘a big mansion’. Yesterday Stuart Rose, the former Marks & Spencer boss, accused Mr Miliband of being a ‘1970s throwback’ in an article for the Daily Mail. Lord Rose, a Tory peer, said Labour’s ‘business bashing’ could curb investment and lead to ‘shuttered shop fronts, empty high streets and lengthening dole queues’. This sparked an angry response from Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls who accused Lord Rose of ‘playing party politics’ and making the claims ‘because he’s a Tory’. But the rush of critical opinion from so many business leaders will be harder for Labour to shrug off. Charlie Mullins, who set up Pimlico Plumbers in 1979, also went on the attack, accusing Mr Miliband of being ‘clueless about business’. The tycoon said: ‘I’m one business owner who isn’t going to keep quiet about the destructive power of having a business-hating government with Ed Miliband at the helm.’ A report by Deutsche Bank warned that British families will face higher borrowing costs under Labour as interest rates earlier to offset extra government spending.","Lastminute.com founder warned UK would face same problems as France .
