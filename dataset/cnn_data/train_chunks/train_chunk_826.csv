"By . Daily Mail Reporter . New York police are looking for a killer who stabbed a six-year-old boy to death and left a seven-year-old girl in critical condition in Brooklyn on Sunday night. The children were in an elevator at an apartment block in Brooklyn's East New York neighborhood and heading out for ice cream when they were attacked at 5.50 pm on Sunday, police said. The madman, who is believed to be heavyset and in his 20s, stabbed the young friends in their torsos after telling them to 'shut up', a police source told the New York Daily News. The body of the little boy, Prince Joshua Avitto - known as 'P.J.' to his family - was found in the elevator in the Boulevard housing development on Schenck Avenue near Stanley Avenue.

Capers is in critical condition . Mikayla Capers, the seven-year-old girl in critical condition, was found in front of a neighboring building after she apparently stumbled from the elevator. The suspect is described as an African-American man who ran off after the attack, police sources told the Daily News. A neighbor who saw the children after the attack says Capers was conscious, but that she was in rough shape. 'The girl was up and talking, but she didn’t look too good,' neighbor Kevin Velez, 41, told the New York Post. 'This is horrendous. The . police need to catch this animal. I saw the . ambulance workers cart out [the boy]. He was lifeless, just lifeless. I . can’t get the image out of my head.' Loss: 'P.J.' was just two weeks away from his seventh birthday, his devastated family said . The children's relatives are struggled to comprehend the senseless crime. 'He . took my pride and joy away,' P.J.'s father, Nicholas Avitto, told the . New York Daily News, as he revealed his heartbreak that he had not . kissed his son that day. Mother of seven-year-old victim Mikayla Capers . 'I'm . devastated. I'm beyond comprehension. I'm trying to understand how God . works. My son is gone. That was the light of my life.' His mother told the New York Post that her son was just 16 days away from turning seven. 'They done killed my baby!' she said outside Brookdale Hospital. Mikayla's mother, Sherina Capers, 21, said she couldn't understand how someone could attack two young children. 'This don’t make no sense,' she said. 'They went to go get an icy and they never made it downstairs.' Crime scene: Avitto's body was found in the elevator inside this apartment building, while Capers was found in front of a neighboring building . A man who identified himself as Capers' uncle told the paper that the community is up in arms over the stabbings and went on to say 'this violence has to stop' in the crime-plagued neighborhood. 'I’m shaking. I have no idea who could have been out there doing this,' 33-year-old Lemar King said. 'They are just little kids. They never did anything to anybody.' The attack came just two days after 18-year-old Long Island University freshman Tayana Copeland died after she was stabbed 32 times in the chest nearby, sources said. Police said they cannot rule out a connection between the two attacks and they are now reviewing surveillance footage.","The body of the boy, Prince Joshua Avitto, was found in an elevator in a Brooklyn apartment building .

"By . Emily Crane . Woolworths has admitted it is still placing orders with a Bangladeshi textile company after one of their factories caught fire, killing seven workers. The company published the names and addresses of 52 Bangladeshi factories that Woolworths' retail brands source from. Bangladesh's poorly-regulated garment industry has been scrutinised of late following a string of industrial disasters and Woolworths said they posted the supplier factory list on their website for 'transparency reasons'. A Bangladeshi factory in Gazipur burnt down in October, killing seven workers after a chimney caught fire. The factory's company, Aswad Composite Mills, is listed as one of Woolworths' suppliers . 'The list is currently complete and up-to-date,' a spokeswoman told MailOnline. Aswad Composite Mills is listed as one of Woolworths' suppliers. It is part of the Palmal Group, which is one of Bangladesh's largest clothing manufacturers. Aswad's Gazipur factory burnt down in October, killing seven workers after a chimney caught fire. 'The Aswad factory listed on our website does not refer to the factory where the fire occurred last year. We did not source directly from that factory,' the spokeswoman said. At the time of the blaze, Woolworths said it could not rule out that it sourced material from the company because it ordered through Palmal. Aswad's Gazipur factory is part of the Palmal Group, which is one of Bangladesh's largest clothing manufacturers . Ahead of the fire, the factory was not one of the 1,600 sites to be inspected under a fire and safety accord because it was not a clothing factory that dealt directly with brands . A spokeswoman said Woolworths had become a signatory of the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety in the month the fire gutted the factory. 'We signed the Accord in October 2013 and pledged to work with other signatories to improve the safety of garment workers in Bangladesh,' she said. 'Palmal factories are signatories of the Accord and our understanding is that all Accord members are producing in line with Bangladeshi law.' Ahead of the fire in October, the Gazipur factory was not one of the 1,600 sites to be inspected under the accord because it was not a clothing factory that dealt directly with brands. Woolworths said it became a signatory of the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety in the month the fire gutted the factory . Woolworths said it has audited all of its supply factories in Bangladesh in the past year. 'We utilise the services of third-party auditing companies,' she said. But Oxfam said audit fraud was common across Asia and using third party companies did not guarantee an independent result. 'Factories can keep double books, and workers might be afraid to speak. We don't see that as truly independent, it's not good enough,' Oxfam's corporate accountability and fair trade adviser, Daisy Gardener, told Fairfax Media. Oxfam is now encouraging Woolworths to list its supplier factories in other countries. The Gazipur factory also made material for Kmart, Target, and Just Group. Kmart was the first Australian company to disclose its supplier factories in Bangladesh in December. Target and Pacific Brands, which sells Bonds and Berlei, committed to publishing their list of supplier locations this year. Bangladesh's poorly-regulated garment industry has been scrutinised of late following a string of industrial disasters, including this factory collapse in the country's capital Dhaka in April last year .","Woolworths has published the 52 Bangladeshi factories they source from .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . Legendary ballplayer Don Zimmer, 83, died Wednesday night months after undergoing heart surgery to repair a leaky heart valve. Zimmer had suffered a stroke in December 2008 and found himself in the operating room for the heart issue on April 16. He was working as a senior adviser for the Rays and was in his 66th season working in professional baseball. Tampa Bay Ray senior adviser Don Zimmer, 83, passed away Wednesday weeks after undergoing heart surgery . He was the last remaining Brooklyn Dodger still professionally active in the sport, the New York Post reported. He . played alongside Jackie Robinson on the only Brooklyn Dodgers team to . win the World Series. He coached Derek Jeter on the New York Yankees' latest dynasty. And his manager once was the illustrious Casey Stengel. For . 66 years, Zimmer was a most popular presence at ballparks all over, a . huge chaw often filling his cheek. Everyone in the game seemed to know . him, and love him. Zimmer was still working for the Tampa Bay Rays . as a senior adviser when he died Wednesday at a hospital in nearby . Dunedin. He had been in a rehabilitation center since having seven hours . of heart surgery in mid-April. 'Today we all lost a national treasure and a wonderful man,' Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg said in a statement. Zimmer . started out as a minor league infielder in 1949, hitting powerful shots . that earned him the nickname 'Popeye.' He went on to enjoy one of the . longest-lasting careers in baseball history. And oh, the stories he could tell. After 66 seasons in the game, he was the last remaining Brooklyn Dodger still professionally active . 'I loved listening to him every day,' Billy Connors, a coach under Zimmer with the Chicago Cubs, told the Associated Press. Zimmer played on the original New York Mets, saw his Boston Red Sox beaten by Bucky Dent's playoff homer, got tossed to the ground by Pedro . Martinez during a brawl and was Joe Torre's right-hand man as the bench . coach with the Yankees. 'I hired him as a coach, and he became . like a family member to me. He has certainly been a terrific credit to . the game,' Torre said in a statement. 'The game was his life. And . his passing is going to create a void in my life and my wife Ali's. We . loved him. The game of baseball lost a special person tonight. He was a . good man,' he said. A career .235 hitter in the big leagues, . numbers could never define all that Zimmer meant to the game. He did . have tremendous success, too — his teams won six World Series rings and . went to the postseason 19 times. Zimmer's No. 66 Rays jersey had . been worn recently by longtime Tampa Bay third base coach Tom Foley in . tribute. The Rays hosted the Miami Marlins on Wednesday night, and Foley . was crying in the dugout. Over his storied career, Zimmer played for for the Chicago Cubs, the original New York Mets, and the Boston Red Sox . Earlier this season, the Rays hung a banner in the front of the press box at Tropicana Field that simply read 'ZIM.' There was a moment of silence at Dodger Stadium for Zimmer before Los Angeles played the Chicago White Sox. 'On . behalf of Major League Baseball and the many clubs that 'Popeye' served . in a distinguished baseball life, I extend my deepest condolences to . Don's family, friends and his many admirers throughout our game,' Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement. Zimmer's biggest . admirer was his wife 'Soot' — they were married at home plate during a . minor league game in 1951. Two years later in the minors, Zimmer's path . took a frightening turn — he was beaned by a fastball and left in a . coma, and doctors had to put metal screws in his head. He . recovered well enough to wear a lot of uniforms during his 56 years in . the majors. He played for the Dodgers, Mets, Cubs, Cincinnati and . Washington. He managed San Diego, Boston, Texas and the Cubs. 'Probably the best baseball man I knew,' Connors said. Don Zimmer started his career as a rookie shortstop with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1954 . Yankees executive Hank Steinbrenner echoed that sentiment. 'I . loved Zim. I loved his passion. He was a great, great guy. He was a . great baseball guy,' he told the AP. 'Everybody loved him.' Steinbrenner, . son of late Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, said Torre and Zimmer . were the 'perfect team' during New York's run that brought four titles . in a five-year span. 'Joe was low-keyed. Zim would get fired up. He was a bench coach for real,' Steinbrenner said. 'He was an extremely . important part of the 1990s success.' Zimmer hit 91 home runs and . had 352 RBIs in 12 seasons. He started Game 7 when Brooklyn beat the . Yankees for the 1955 crown and was an All-Star in 1961. For 66 years, Zimmer was a most popular presence at ballparks all over . The next year, he played under Stengel on the 1962 expansion Mets, who famously went 40-120. 'Don't blame them all on me,' Zimmer once said. 'I got traded after the first 30 days.' Zimmer . was the 1989 NL Manager of the Year with the Cubs and was at Yankee . Stadium for three perfect games, by Don Larsen in the 1956 World Series . and by David Cone and David Wells in the late 1990s. 'It's a sad . day for the game of baseball,' Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said . after a 3-2 loss at San Diego. 'Don impacted lives from the time he put a . uniform on in the minor leagues until today.' Zimmer is survived by his wife; son Thomas, a scout with the San Francisco Giants; daughter Donna, and four grandchildren.","Last Brooklyn Dodger still active in baseball .

"By . Ryan Lipman . It was the book that kept millions of women enthralled, but now the erotic bestseller's Sydney-based publisher is embroiled in a bitter legal dispute for allegedly cutting two women out of a share of the rights to the series worth millions. Erotic thriller Fifty Shades of Grey made author E.L. James a star as it sold more than 100 million copies, but now two Texas women claim they helped contribute to the books' success and they want their share. Jennifer Pedroza and Christa Beebe filed a lawsuit in a US county court claiming they were tricked out advances and royalties by their business partner, Australian publisher Amanda Hayward, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. In a 48-page brief filed to the Tarrant County Court, in Fort Worth, Texas, the women's US attorney Mike Farris alleged 'greed and self-dealing by Amanda Hayward in conning her business partner Jenny Pedroza'  and 'fraudulently inducting' both Ms Pedroza and Ms Beebe into employment. Sydney-based publisher Amanda Hayward, pictured, has been accused of scamming former business partner Jennifer Lynn Pedroza out of rights to the Fifty Shades series . The lawsuit also said it appeared 'that Hayward also defrauded, among others . . . Random House, and E.L. James, author of the 'Fifty Shades' trilogy,' reported courthousenews.com and that 'because of her chicanery, all payments flowed to her'. The women are now seeking a share of advances and royalties in the dispute, with it believed Random House paid tens of millions for the publish rights to the three books in the Fifty Shades series. Ms Pedroza of Arlington, Texas, alleges she was a foundation partner with Ms Hayward in The Writers Coffee Shop (TWCS). Ms Hayward established TWCS in 2009 as a library of free online fan fiction stories where, according to its own website, 'friends meet to discuss books, blogs, serial fiction, news'. TWCS launched as a virtual publishing company in October 2010, 'with the vision of working alongside talented authors while providing quality e-books to the growing marketplace'. In May 2011, the company released an e-book and a print on demand paperback of Fifty Shades of Grey. The lawsuit alleges Ms Hayward subsequently and fraudulently restructured the business under the smokescreen of tax minimisation without without telling her partners. Bestseller: The deal with the Sydney-based publisher and Random House was reportedly worth tens of millions . This restructure is said to have enabled payments from the Random House deal to flow exclusively to here, when the deal was signed in March 2012. Ms Pedroza claims she only received a one-off payment of $100,000 from the initial Random House advance despite organising speaking engagements, issuing press releases and packing and mailing paperback books for the partnership. After Ms Hayward allegedly swore on her own daughter's lives she would never terminate Ms Pedroza services, this lead the complainant to sign an individual contractor agreement. But despite Ms Hayward's promise, Ms Pedroza was sacked in January 2013 and is now seeking monetary relief worth more than $1 million. Second complainant Christa Beebe become tangled in the dispute when she took an unpaid position to help market and distribute books including the Fifty Shades trilogy in January 2012. While her role became a salaried position, it is alleged Ms Beebe rejected a teaching job based on Ms Hayward's promises of full time employment, but was also sacked. The complainants against Ms Hayward allege she has spent some of the money from the deal on her lavish home in Dural, in Sydney's north suburbs . Both women now claim Ms Hayward has spent some of the money from the lucrative Random House deal on a lavish $5 million home featuring pool and tennis court in Dural, in north western Sydney and also gymnastics gym. The lawyer representing the women, Mike Farris, of Dallas firm Vincent Lopez Serafino Jenevein said his clients argue that Ms Hayward's company, which was set up under Australian law, never owned the publishing rights to the Fifty Shades series. 'I believe that the law, the facts and the equities are in our favour, although I never like to speculate on the outcome of the case. However, I like our chances in front of a jury,' Mr Farris said. As part of the lawsuit, the court is being asked to accept that The Writers Coffee Shop is an ongoing partnership and, as Ms Pedroza is a partner, she is entitled to 25 per cent of the profits. The court has temporarily restrained Hayward from collecting any additional proceeds from the books' sales. A hearing date of June 12 has been set down for the women's application for a temporary injunction. Both women are seeking equitable relief, including injunctive relief, the imposition of a constructive trust, damages, and to trap funds not yet paid by Random House. Mr Farris does not expect either author E.L. James, a pseudonym for Erika Leonard, or Random House to be required as parties in the law suit. The claim also raises allegations that Hayward defrauded E.L. James and publishers Random House by signing an agreement with them on behalf of a company that did not own the publishing rights. The first Fifty Shades book is currently being made into a Hollywood movie.","Australian Amanda Hayward jointly set up a free online book library .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Tara Brady . A spiritual adviser to the New Hampshire man accused of strangling a female college student to death while raping her has taken the stand in his trial. Roberta Gerkin took the stand for the second day in Seth Mazzaglia's trial for the killing of 19-year-old college student Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott on October 9, 2012. Gerkin testified that she was invited to Mazzaglia's apartment shortly after murder and saw Marriot's body with two plastic bags tied over her head, according to WMUR. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Testy: Defense attorney Joachim Barth cross examines testimony Monday from witness Roberta Gerkin at Strafford Superior Court in Dover, N.H., during the murder trial of Seth Mazzaglia . Victim: Police say Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott (left and right), the 19-year-old killed during an attempted sexual assault on October 9 in Dover, New Hampshire, was the victim of a violent strip poker threesome . The spiritual adviser was asked whether she thought Mazzaglia, 31, would 'do the right thing' and call an ambulance, as well as if he displayed any remorse over the teen's death. Her testimony became testy as she sparred with a defense lawyer over the meaning of the word 'ligature' and whether she saw marks on Marriot's wrists that would show a ligature was used. 'If I do not know what a ligature is, how do I know what is like a ligature?' She snapped at the attorney when he tried to prove her previous testimony false. A ligature is material used to tie or bind, and would have been used to tie her wrists, likely leaving a mark. Prosecutors have charged Mazzaglia with rape and murder, but he maintains she died during rough consensual sex. Marriott, of Westborough, Massachusetts, was a student at the University of New Hampshire and was lured to Mazzaglia's apartment by his then-girlfriend, Kathryn McDonough, it is claimed. Also in court: Seth Mazzaglia is led from Strafford County Superior Court in Dover, N.H., Monday, June 2, 2014, during lunch break in his trial . Shocked: Lizzi Marriott's family has railed at that notion she died during consensual sex with Mazzaglia . Prosecutors claim that Mazzaglia . choked Marriott from behind with a rope while she sat on a couch in his . apartment on Mill Street in Dover. Assistant . Attorney General Peter Hinckley told the jury on Wednesday that after . Marriott could no longer object to Mazzaglia's sexual advances because . of the choking, he pushed her underwear out of the way and raped her . while McDonough, 19, did nothing to help. Hinckley portrayed Mazzaglia as a bondage, domination and sadomasochism 'master' who treated McDonough as a 'submissive slave.' Suspect: Seth Mazzaglia (left and right) of Dover, who is . a struggling actor has been arrested and charged with the murder of . missing student Lizzi Marriott . He also said Mazzaglia ordered McDonough to find him another woman to dominate in a sexual way before meeting Marriott. The couple even posted ads online looking for a sexual slave to do light housework, it was alleged. Yesterday Brittany Atwood, 26, described as Marriott's first girlfriend, took to the witness stand. Atwood . told Hinckley that she became good friends with Marriott in January . 2012 and they became romantically involved in February or March. They met while working at a Stop and Shop in Massachusetts. She described Marriott as beautiful, kindheated, caring, trusting, goofy, silly and experimental. Atwood . said the last message she received from Marriott was at 8.55pm on the . night she was allegedly murdered. It said: 'You're so cute!' Accomplice: Kathryn McDonough, 19, is charged with lying to authorities regarding the death of Lizzie Marriot . Atwood said she then sent Marriott two text messages - one at 8.59pm and one at 9.06pm but Marriott never responded. Atwood said became worried the next morning when she had not heard from Marriott and contacted her parents. After the police were contacted, Atwood told them Marriott was planning to meet McDonagh after her chemistry lab class. However, during cross examination, public defender Melissa Davis asked Atwood if Marriott was also into 'fantasy type stuff'. According to Atwood, Marriott like anime and video games like World of Warcraft. She was also into Game of Thrones. 'She was also experimental, so if she wanted to try something, she was going to try it,' Davis said. Charged: Kathryn McDonough, 19, seen at her arraignment (left) and arrest (right) was charged with lying to the police about her whereabouts on the night that a supposed friend went missing . She also asked Atwood whether she had been told Marriott was playing strip poker with McDonoughand Mazzaglia. 'You did not get a text message that strip poker was being played?' Davis asked. 'No,' Atwood said. 'You did not know that she was playing strip poker?' Davis asked. 'No,' Atwood said. 'You didn't know she was playing strip poker that night until much later,' Davis said. 'I didn't know at all,' Atwood said. Recently released court documents describe the couple's interviews with police starting three days after Marriott disappeared. First . Mazzaglia said Marriott had never made it to their place that night — . he had gone out for a run, hurt his ankle and was slow returning to the . house. McDonough told police she went to a nearby cemetery in hopes of capturing images of ghosts with her digital camera. Mystery: A Portsmouth fire boat searches the Piscataqua River in New Hampshire for the body of student Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott. No body was ever found . But Mazzaglia's story soon began to change. In an interview later the same day, he talked of bondage and sadomasochism. He . implicated McDonough and another couple in harming Marriott, saying . when he arrived home Marriott had a ligature mark around her neck. He suggested another man had done something terrible, but he wouldn't say what. Finally, . police said, Mazzaglia admitted he was involved. He and McDonough were . playing strip poker with Marriott and that led to intercourse. Mazzaglia said he was having sex with Marriott — and tightening a rope around her neck — when she had a 'seizure.' Mazzaglia told investigators neither he nor McDonough tried to revive Marriott or summon help. Instead, he told them, he put a grocery bag over her head and tied it at the neck. Mazzaglia . told investigators he and McDonough used Marriott's 2001 Mazda to take . her body to Peirce Island in Portsmouth, where they threw it and her . cellphone into the Piscataqua River. When . Marriott's torso remained above water, he said, McDonough went into the . water and pushed it under, making a joke about 'Davy Jones' locker.' The . pair then drove Marriott's car to UNH, left it in a student lot and . discarded her belongings in trash bins, authorities allege. Mazzaglia . was arrested October 13 — a day after he was interviewed — and . McDonough on Christmas Eve. He is being held without bond, charged with . first-degree murder. She has been indicted on charges of conspiracy and hindering prosecution. She was released on $35,000 bond on the condition she live with her parents in Portsmouth. Family members describe Marriott as 'gullible' - someone who easily could be taken advantage of because of her trusting nature. One family friend from Westborough, Mass., where Marriott grew up, called her naive. 'She . was just a good girl. That's probably what got her in trouble,' Dawn . Downey said. 'She was too trusting and she was beautiful. Those two . things will kill you.'","Seth Mazzaglia, 31, is accused of raping and killing Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott .

The couple were trying to book in to their honeymoon suite when an argument began at reception. Police arrest the bride outside the Hilton on Deansgate. A passer-by took this photograph of the unhappy bride . The happy couple tried to register at the Hilton on Deansgate, Manchester but instead found themselves spending the night in police cells . The discussion became more heated and the concierge called hotel security to calm the situation. That only succeeded in inflaming matters and a fight broke out between security staff and the couple. The 25-year-old groom then allegedly attacked one of the security guards, cutting his face in the process. The bride allegedly shouted racial abuse at the Asian guards. The groom was arrested on suspicion of a section 47 assault with his 29-year-old wife being held on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence. They spent their wedding night in separate cells and remain in custody for questioning. Nick Adderley, Chief Superintendent of Greater Manchester Police’s North Division has backed his officers. He said: ‘Police were asked to attend and we did so. ‘We obviously had to decide whether it was right thing to do, to arrest. ‘But it absolutely was and I support the officers who made that decision. ‘We can’t have a situation where, regardless of what ceremony they have been to, people are being allegedly assaulted and racially abused.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Husband and wife attempted to book in at Hilton on Deansgate, Manchester .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Florida teacher and her 58-year-old boyfriend have been accused of sexually abusing a 13-year-old girl. Kimberly Honaker, 48, had been charged on Saturday with child neglect for allegedly failing to intervene to stop Robert Pruitt sexually abusing a child. But on Tuesday Honaker, who has been suspended from the middle school she worked at for 17 years, was arrested again over claims that she had also molested the young girl. Arrest: Kimberley Honaker and Robert Pruitt are accused of sexually abusing a 13-year-old girl . When the language teacher was arrested for a second time, she was charged with lewd molestation and the use of a child in a sexual performance. The couple's alleged victim has been put in the care of the Florida Department of Children and Families. The couple were arrested after Pruitt's . ex-wife alerted police to Facebook messages, texts and emails that . suggested an inappropriate relationship was taking place. Charges: Honaker is accused of child neglect and lewd molestation . Pruitt had moved in with Honaker, who he has known for years, in May. Police described the house they shared as being filthy and containing 20 dogs. Honaker, a mom to twin girls, has been banned from the school campus and is expected to have her pay suspended at the next school meeting, a district spokesman told the Orlando Sentinel. Police said that the alleged abuse did not take place at the school Honaker works at, but its principal released a statement to students' families earlier this week, announcing the arrest. 'You may see media reports regarding one of our teachers who was arrested this past weekend for a situation unrelated to any of the duties the teacher performed here at our school. 'The teacher has not returned to school since the arrest. We are cooperating fully with law enforcement,' the statement said. Police told Click Orlando that Pruitt's ex-wife had kicked him out of their home earlier this year after suspecting him of having a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old. He then moved in with Honaker, who is accused of allowing the abuse to continue over the next few weeks. Honaker and Pruitt are being held without bail at the Orange County Jail.","Kimberly Honaker is accused of letting Robert Pruitt abuse child .

According to Police Captain John Przepiorka, Alexander had already stolen an X-Box and a laptop and woke up two of the residents when he clambered in through a rear bathroom window. 'He was taking items from the property and a resident from the property woke up startled,' said Przepiorka. 'A struggle started at that point, the resident screamed for help.' At this point a second man arrived and shot Alexander two or three times with a legally registered firearm. The third occupant of the house slept through the brawl. Remnants: The cash and wallet that were left on the steps in the aftermath of the shooting are visible here in this image . Philadelphia's Action News spoke to a friend of the men who lived in the home and said the man opened fire because he had no other option.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The founder of Russian communism Vladamir Lenin died after being poisoned by his political successor Joseph Stalin, according to a sensational new theory. Russian historian Lev Lurie, believes that while Lenin was already in poor health having suffered several strokes, Stalin may have finished him off after a bitter feud. Lenin, who had initially supported Stalin's rise to power, later began aligning himself with Leon Trotsky. Theory: Russian historian Lev Lurie believes Lenin, left, could have been poisoned by his political rival and successor Joseph Stalin, right . In notes dictated before his death, Lenin criticises Stalin's rude manners and ambitious nature. He even suggested that Stalin should be removed from his position of General Secretary of the Communist Party. Poisoning would later become Stalin's preferred method for dealing with his enemies, Lurie points out. He added: 'The funny thing is that the brain of Lenin still is preserved in Moscow, so we can investigate.' Popular theory maintains that Lenin died from the sexually-transmitted disease syphilis. Stalin was reportedly furious after Lenin aligned himself with Trotsky (pictured) His embalmed body still lies . on public display in a Red Square mausoleum almost 20 years after the . collapse of the communist state he helped bring to life. Mr Lurie and UCLA neurologist Dr. Harry Vinters reviewed Lenin's records for an annual conference at the . University of Maryland School of Medicine . on famous people's deaths. Dr Vinters put forward a separate theory, maintaining that stress or a family medical history could have accounted for Lenin's death . Prior to his death, the 53-year-old Soviet leader's health had been growing worse . over time. In 1921, he forgot the words of a major speech and he had to . learn to speak again and write with his left hand after one stroke. A . subsequent major stroke later left him paralyzed on one side and unable to speak. An autopsy found blood vessels in his brain were extremely hardened, results that have been difficult to understand, said Dr. Philip Mackowiak, who organizes the yearly event. 'Number one, he's so young and number two, he has none of the important risk factors,' Mackowiak said. Lenin didn't smoke - he never let smokers near him. He also didn't have diabetes, wasn't overweight and the autopsy didn't find any evidence of high blood pressure, Mackowiak said. There was 'considerable suspicion' among Russians at the time of Lenin's death that syphilis was to blame, Mackowiak said. However, family history appears to have worked more against Lenin, Vinters said. Lenin's embalmed body still lies on public display in a Red Square mausoleum almost 20 years after the collapse of the communist state he helped bring to life . Lenin was treated for syphilis using the primitive medications available at the time, and while the sexually transmitted disease can cause strokes, there is no evidence from his symptoms or the autopsy that was the case with Lenin, Vinters said. The Soviet leader's father also died at 54 and both may have been predisposed to hardening of the arteries. Stress also is a risk factor for strokes, and there's no question the communist revolutionary was under plenty of that, the neurologist said. 'People were always trying to assassinate him, for example.' Dr Vinters said. Dr Vinters, who reviewed autopsy records and the leader's clinical history, said toxicology tests that might have revealed poisoning were not conducted during the autopsy. Reports from the time also show Lenin was active and talking a few hours before his death. 'And then he experienced a series of really, really bad convulsions which is quite unusual for someone who has a stroke,' Vinters said. The conference is held yearly at the . school, where researchers in the past have re-examined the diagnoses of . figures including King Tut, Christopher Columbus, Simon Bolivar and . Abraham Lincoln.","Popular theory maintains Lenin died from the sexually-transmitted disease syphilis .

"By . Associated Press . A man who supplied nearly 10 pounds of methamphetamine to a drug operation run by a Catholic priest dubbed Monsignor Meth was sentenced Wednesday to more than five years in prison, telling a judge he was overcome by his addiction and never intended to become such a big dealer. Chad McCluskey, 44, was sentenced to five years, five months behind bars for his role in a massive meth operation . Chad McCluskey, 44, of San Clemente, California, was sentenced in federal court in Hartford to five years, five months behind bars. He and his girlfriend, Kristen Laschober, of Laguna Niguel, California, pleaded guilty last year to drug conspiracy charges connected to their meth business with now-suspended Monsignor Kevin Wallin. Laschober awaits sentencing. Wallin, nicknamed Monsignor Meth in some media reports, also pleaded guilty to a federal drug charge and awaits sentencing. He is facing 11 to 14 years in prison for selling large quantities of meth out of his apartment in Waterbury. Two other men pleaded guilty to helping Wallin sell the drugs in Connecticut. 'I would like to apologize to the court for my conduct and to the communities I've hurt,' McCluskey said in court, crying at times. 'And to my friends who stood by me ... and to my family. ... I didn't think it was going to be a business, and my addiction got so heavy that my judgment was clouded. ... I never set out to be a drug dealer.' Authorities said McCluskey started sending small amounts of meth to Wallin in early 2009, and the operation grew before it ended in late 2012, shortly before everyone was arrested. Federal officials say McCluskey and Laschober sent 1 to 3 pounds a month to Wallin over six months. McCluskey also admitted distributing at least 12 pounds of meth to drug sellers in another part of the country. McCluskey once supplied ten pounds of methamphetamine to a priest dealer known as Monsignor Meth . McCluskey grew up near Chicago, graduated from Drake University in Iowa and held good jobs before his drug addiction did him in, said his lawyer, Todd Bussert. Wallin, 62, had been the pastor at St. Augustine Parish in Bridgeport for nine years before resigning in 2011, citing health and personal problems. He previously served as pastor of St. Peter's Church in Danbury. The Diocese of Bridgeport indefinitely revoked Wallin's priest powers in 2012. Connecticut police and federal agents said they also discovered during their investigation that Wallin had bought an adult video and sex-toy shop in North Haven, apparently to launder all the money he was making. Wallin's case drew comparisons to the TV show 'Breaking Bad,' about a high school science teacher who became a meth kingpin. McCluskey grew up near Chicago, graduated from Drake University in Iowa and held good jobs before his drug addiction did him in, said his lawyer, Todd Bussert (not pictured) Authorities say the case was unusual because methamphetamine hasn't been a big problem in the state as it has in others. In fact, officials said Wallin's case was the first federal prosecution of a meth case in Connecticut that they could remember. Bussert said McCluskey had a long-standing drug problem. 'This isn't a guy who woke up one day and decided to break bad,' Bussert said.","Chad McCluskey, 44, supplied nearly 10 pounds of meth to the operation .

"By . Michael Zennie . The parents of a Georgia nurse who was killed in a Chevrolet Cobalt with a defective ignition switch say a General Motors engineer lied to cover up the fact that the company knew about the problem. General Motors is facing mounting pressure over the 2.6million vehicles it has recalled over the defect. The company has admitted that the problem caused 13 deaths - though families say the death toll is even higher. Adding to the insult, some grief-stricken families who lost loved ones in faulty GM vehicles have received recall notices from the company. Scroll down for video . Ken Melton sobs as he looks at the mangled Chevrolet Cobalt that killed his daughter Brooke in 2010 . Brooke Melton's family settled a lawsuit with General Motors over her death. But, they are re-filing their lawsuit and claiming GM withheld information . Brooke Melton, 29, died in March 2010 in Georgia when he 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt stalled, hit another car and dropped 15 feet down a ravine. A crash investigator found that the key was in the 'accessory' position, which would have shut off the airbags, power steering and anti-lock brakes. Ken and Beth Melton sued and settled with GM in September 2013. But they have re-filed the suit, alleging the company withheld evidence that the company knew about the defect for ten years. They tell CNN Money that GM lied to them about what the company knew when their daughter died. The new lawsuit singles out Ray DiGiorgio, the head engineer who designed the ignition switch. He told the Meltons' lawyers that he had submitted no requests to change the design of the switch - meaning that GM didn't realize it was a problem. However, documents later emerged that DiGiorgio had requested to redesign the device after flaws were found, according to CNN Money. Melton lost control of her car, hit another vehicle and then crashed into a ravine . The Meltons allege Ray DeGiogio, a GM engineer, lied in his deposition and helped hide information about the problems with GM ignition switches . GM says DiGiorgio has been suspended, pending an internal investigation. 'They thought they had the truth when the settled the case. We now know that they had some of the truth, but not all of the truth,' the Meltsons' lawyer Lance Cooper said. Brooke is not one of the 13 deaths counted in the GM figure because her death was not the result of a front-impact crash. This has led consumer advocates to say the faulty ignition switches could have resulted in many more fatalities. It has also been revealed that GM recently sent recall notices to the families victims killed because of the faulty switch. The company has issued an apology. 'We are deeply sorry to those families who received a recall notice,' said GM spokesman Greg Martin. Terri DiBattista, who lost her 16-year-old daughter Amber Marie Rose in a 2005 Maryland accident involving a Chevrolet Cobalt, told Reuters she received two recall notices from GM last week asking her to bring in the vehicle to fix the ignition switch and power steering. The car was destroyed when Rose crashed into a tree. The postcards were mailed to the family at its new address in South Carolina, where DiBattista said they moved to recover from the loss. Sent by a local GM dealer, the cards detailed three different recalls GM has issued involving the Cobalt in recent months. DiBattista said GM could have identified the destroyed car through a simple check of Vehicle Identification Numbers.","Brooke Melton, 29, died in 2010 when her ignition switch failed, causing her to crash .

Quiet suburban life in a neighborhood outside San Diego came to a smashing halt Wednesday afternoon when an aging U.S. Marine Corps fighter jet crashed into three homes and burst into flames. Miraculously, no one was hurt. The pilot of the AV-8B Harrier safely ejected before it crashed into a home in Imperial Valley, California, near the Mexican border about 4.30pm, Pacific Time. Three homes were damaged and at least one destroyed in impact and subsequent blaze. At least one house caught fire after an AV-8B Harrier jet smashed into a home in Imperial Valley, California, on Wednesday afternoon . Three homes were damaged - one of which was destroyed - when the jet slammed into the neighborhood . Military investigators worked into the night gathering evidence and trying to determine what caused the crash of the $30million fighter . The 1980s-era Harrier jet is known for it's ability to take off and land vertically like a helicopter thanks to jump jet thrusters direct thrust at the ground. The planes cost about $30million each. Neighbors told the Imperial Valley Press that the crash felt like an earthquake. Plumes of smoke could be seen rising high above the neighbor from miles away from the crash site. Video from the scene shows fiery debris cluttering the streets and sidewalks of the neighborhood. The pilot was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation. Video shows him being helped by good Samaritans, his parachute still attached, after he come down in a parking lot a shot distance from the crash site. The jet was based out of the Third Marine Aircraft Wing in Miramar, but the yet took off Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona. It is the second Harrier jet to crash this month. On May 9, a plane went down about 40 miles outside Phoenix. The pilot was able to safely eject then, as well.

"By . Chris Hastings . James Bond has entered into mortal combat with some of the world’s most dangerous criminals on countless occasions – yet always beats the odds and walks away with his life. Now one eagle-eyed fan has calculated the exact probability of 007 dodging death so many times – and come to the conclusion he should have died years ago. Gordon Stanger worked out that the spy had been shot at a staggering 4,662 times since the first film, Dr No, in 1962. Death defying: Daniel Craig, pictured in 2006's Casino Royale, is one of several Bonds to have improbably dodged death over the years . The survival of James Bonds like Piers Brosnan is all the more surprising given the spy normally, unlike this picture, finds himself unarmed when faced with death . He then estimated there was a 5 per cent chance of the spy being fatally wounded on each occasion. Expressed mathematically, this means the chance of Bond not getting killed is 1.4 x 10 to the power of minus 104, or in Mr Stanger’s words, ‘as close to zero as makes no difference’. When you take into account the 130 other attempts on Bond’s life that did not involve being shot at, the chances of him surviving are even slimmer. There have been 22 official Bond movies and the attempts on 007’s life have grown increasingly sinister. In the 1964 film Goldfinger, Bond was handcuffed to a ticking bomb and strapped to a table underneath a giant laser. Mr Stanger estimates that over the years James Bond (played by Roger Moore, left, and Sean Connery, right) has killed 198 of his enemies in the films . When the agent asks: ‘Do you expect me to talk?’ the film’s eponymous villain replies: ‘No, Mr Bond, I expect you to die.’ Bond’s survival rate is even more staggering when you consider he is rarely armed when he finds himself in a fight to the death. His survival is often due to his use of household appliances, such as lamps or abandoned objects. Mr Stanger, who lives in the Solomon Islands, also estimates that Britain’s most famous agent has killed 198 of his enemies in the films. Mr Stanger constructed his formula after New Scientist magazine asked its readers to work out what was the probability of Bond still being alive. The 23rd Bond film, Skyfall, which will star Daniel Craig, Dame Judi Dench and Naomie Harris, is currently being filmed.","Chance of Bond not being killed over the years is 'as close to zero as makes no difference'

"By . Jessica Jerreat . An Indiana woman has been accused of shooting her ex-husband ten times before hiding his body in a large metal box outside her trailer. Raymond Green's body was found padlocked inside a tool box on land belonging to his ex-wife Danielle Marie Green on May 28. The 42-year-old had told police they could search everything on her farm except the box, which was covered in flies and smelled of decay. Arrest: Danielle Green has been charged with murder after her ex-husband Ray was found shot dead . Victim: Ray Green's body was discovered in a tool box after his family reported him missing . At first Green, a piano teacher with a MA in music education, told police that she hadn't seen her ex-husband since he got into a fight with her dog on May 26. But when the 62-year-old's body was discovered in the tool box, she allegedly claimed to have shot him in self-defense. Results from an autopsy showed that he was shot once in the temple, four times in the back of the head and five times in the body on May 26. The couple had divorced in January but were still sharing a home at the time of Mr Green's death. They had moved to Indiana from Florida two years ago to care for Green's parents who had cancer. Her parents died last year. Green, who has been charged with murder, allegedly told police she killed her ex-husband with a .38 gun that was in his bedroom because he had threatened to kill her. Separated: Danielle Green, left, and Ray, right, had divorced at the start of the year but still lived together . County prosecutor Aaron Negangard told WCPO: 'He's standing there - doesn't have the gun - but he's standing there and says, ""I'm going to kill you. You need to die"". 'She pushes him, shoots him five times, goes into a room on the opposite side of the trailer, unloads, reloads ... she shoots him five more times.' Police were alerted to a possible problem at the couple's farm after the victim's family filed a missing person's report. When detectives arrived at the couple's home to check on Green's ex-husband, she claimed she hadn't seen him since May 26, when he had a fight with her dog. Police later discovered she had called his boss on May 27 to claim he had died in an accident over the weekend. Later that day, she called the boss back and claimed her dog had killed Mr Green. When detectives searched the couple's property, Green told them they couldn't search the padlocked tool box. Self-defense: Green allegedly told police she acted in self-defense when she shot her ex-husband ten times . She told Detective Peter Tressler it belonged to her husband and 'she did not want to be responsible for the ramifications of what may be in the box', according to Cincinnati.com. As well as finding the victim's body in the box, police discovered items that had possibly been used to clean up the trailer after the shooting. Court documents, seen by Eagle Country Online, showed that in March Green searched the internet for 'headshot from .38 at close range', 'if you shoot someone with a .38 caliber handgun in the head is it lights out or possibly survive' and 'what happens when you get shot in the head'. Green, who is being held without bond, has pleaded not guilty to murder.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A teenage couple from Colorado accused of murdering the boy's grandfather, and killing and dismembering his grandmother, allegedly planned the grisly crime so he could collect his inheritance. Brendan Johnson, 19, and 18-year-old Cassandra Rieb appeared in court Wednesday in Sterling, a small city on Colorado's rural northeastern plains 110 miles northeast of Denver, a day after they were arrested in the deaths of Charles and Shirley Severance, both 70. Arrest affidavits show both teens told police they planned to kill Johnson's grandparents by smothering them with pillows as they slept. Police say Rieb told them Johnson wanted to inherit their house and $20,000 from their checking account. Scroll down for video . 'Criminal duo': Brendan Johnson, 19 (left), and his girlfriend, Cassandra Rieb, 18 (right), are accused of murdering the boy's grandparents in order to get their hands on $20,000 . Crime scene: Police performing a welfare check found Charles Severance's body inside his Sterling, Colorado, home nine days after the murder . Police say the teens dumped some of Shirley Severance's remains at a a reservoir near Sterling and others about 30 miles away across the state line in Lorenzo, Nebraska. Police discovered Charles Severance's body in his home last week. The teenage couple are being held without bond in the Logan County jail on suspicion of first-degree murder as well as felony robbery, theft and forgery charges. Victim: Shirley Severance, 70, was stabbed multiple times, strangled to death with a string, burned and dismembered . ‘These are the charges they are being held on and not necessarily the formal charges,’ Sterling Police Chief Tyson Kerr said in a statement. ‘In addition, some of these charges may be filed as crimes against an at-risk adult.’ Kerr said an autopsy will be performed on Shirley Severence this week. Police have not revealed the full autopsy results for her husband, only saying that the body did not exhibit signs of trauma or injury. The body of Charles Severance was discovered in his home in the 400 block of South Third Avenue May 29 after Brendan Johnson contacted police asking them to perform a welfare check. According to court documents, following their arrest the couple admitted that they had begun planning the murders in early May. ‘We had agreed to do it together; Obviously… like one get one and the other get the other one,’ Cassandra Reib was allegedly quoted as saying in the affidavit obtained by The Denver Channel. According to the document, Rieb told investigators Shirley Severance offered her and her grandson money, but the pair stabbed and strangled the woman to death anyway. Johnson allegedly said he and Rieb entered his grandparents’ Sterling home May 20. The plan was that he would strangle his grandfather and Rieb would attack his grandmother. The 70-year-old Mr Severance put up a fight, and Johnson told police he believed the elderly man ultimately died of a heart attack. Confession, Rieb, 18, told police the plan was for her to kill Shirley Severance while her boyfriend attacked his grandfather . Motive: Police say the Walmart worker wanted to inherit $20,000 and his grandparents' home . In the meantime, his girlfriend confronted Shirley Severance, who offered the couple money, but the 18-year-old tried to strangle her. The woman’s grandson attempted to slit her throat, but missed and cut her jaw. Mrs Severance tried to flee, but Johnson pulled her back into the house and stabbed her multiple times before strangling her with a string. Before she died, Shirley Severance reportedly asked her attackers, ‘Why are you doing this to me,’ according to Rieb. Johnson allegedly responded, ‘You know why.’ The couple escaped in Charles Severance’ truck after Johnson allegedly wrote out two fake checks and forged his grandfather’s signature. It was not until nine days later that Brendan Johnson called police. In the meantime, the 19-year-old Walmart employee used the stolen vehicle to go to a concert in Denver and to dispose of his grandmother's corpse. To cover up the evidence, the couple burned and buried the 70-year-old woman's body in two separate locations. Johnson revealed during questioning that after he doused his grandmother’s body with gasoline and lit it on fire at a reservoir near Sterling, he tried to hack off an arm and a leg. The pair came back to collect the scorched remains buried in a fire pit a few days later, but could not get to them because there were people camping in the area. They made a third trip to the reservoir May 28, at which time they dug up the body and re-interred it in Nebraska. Johnson and Rieb are due back in court June 18. If convicted, they could face life without parole or the death penalty. var p = new anv_pl_def(); p.config = {}; p.config.width = 636; p.config.height = 358; p.loadVideoExpressV3('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|1000011|SPS'); .","Brendan Johnson, 19, and Cassandra Rieb, 18, charge with killing Johnson's grandparents Charles and Shirley Severance, both 70 .

"By . Dan Bloom . A Tennessee cotton factory is being investigated after a supervisor was allegedly recorded threatening to 'hang' a black employee if he drank water from the 'whites-only' fountain. In something that could be straight out of the Jim Crow era, the unidentified supervisor at Atkinson Cotton Warehouse in Memphis is also heard comparing black employees to monkeys and pining for the days of racial segregation, claiming 'now everybody is made to think it's bad.' After enduring months of racist taunts, forklift operator Antonia Harris resorted to secretly recording the bullying using his cell phone. Now he and fellow victim Marrio Mengrum have filed a racial discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, saying the shocking treatment has had a lasting effect on them. Scroll down for video . Claims: Forklift operator Antonio Harris made a secret recording of a man, allegedly his warehouse supervisor, telling him he would be 'hanged' for using a 'white people only' drinking fountain in Memphis, Tennessee . The recording on his phone was sent to news channel WREG and features a man, allegedly his factory supervisor, firing racist abuse at Mr Harris as he tries to drink from a water fountain. 'Hey', says the man. 'I need to put a sign there that says ""white people only""'. After an argument, the man laughs as Mr Harris says: 'Put your sign on the wall then, because I'm feeling to drink it. What they do when they catch me drinking your water?' 'That's when we hang you,' the man replies. Mr Harris is also heard saying he wants to use the microwave. 'Hell no!' the man replies. When asked why not, he says: 'Because you are not white.' Incredulous, Mr Harris says: 'For real?'. The reply comes: 'As a white man, we don't even let Larry [a black employee of more than 10 years] use it.' Case: The pair have filed discrimination charges against the Atkinson cotton warehouse in Memphis (pictured) The recording also features the man saying 'nobody thought anything' of segregation in the past and 'now everybody is made... to think it's bad.' Mr Harris and Mr Mangrum told the news channel they had been left hurt by the way they were treated. Mr Harris added: 'I think about this every day of my life'. The pair have filed discrimination charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. They also say black workers were called 'monkeys' and the supervisor told them to 'kiss his white tail', though this was not recorded on tape. 'We all know what monkey means,' Mr Mangrum told ABC News. 'That’s very offensive.' 'I had to bite my tongue a lot,' Mr Harris added. The cotton industry was once synonymous with slavery in the Deep South. Hurt: Marrio Mangrum, pictured, has joined the action against the factory . After the 1793 invention of the mechanical cotton gin, a machine for separating fibers from seeds, slave-produced cotton spread throughout South Carolina and Georgia. The link is so prevalent that the phrase 'cotton-picking' is widely regarded as a racial slur. However, Mr Harris said he had worked in the cotton industry for 12 years and he had never encountered problems until now. Lawyers watching the case said the warehouse will need to settle. 'I’m sure there will be other witnesses who can also confirm these things were said,' employment and labor law attorney Matthew Billips told ABC. The company that runs the warehouse, Federal Compress, released a statement to ABC News saying it had 'zero tolerance' for discrimination and that the supervisor was no longer employed with the company. The cotton warehouse could not be reached for comment by MailOnline, and provided no comment to WREG. The EEOC said it was prohibited from giving any details on individual cases.","Secret recordings were allegedly taken at warehouse in Memphis, Tennessee .

"By . Daniel Mills . An Australian start-up company is considering launching legal action against US tech giant Apple, alleging it stole the name it trades under for a mobile app. The company with two owners and a small headquarters in Melbourne, is but a speck in the market when it comes to a company like Apple, but it appears they liked the Australian brand so much 'They have used our name and launched a new product called HealthKit,' company co-founder Alison Hardacre said. Ms Hardacre's fury boiled over on Tuesday morning when she woke just after 4.30am to emails informing her that one of the world's biggest companies had stolen her business name. Alison Hardacre and her business partner are considering suing Apple over the unregistered use their company's name . HealthKit is the name she and co-founder Lachlan Wheeler launched back in 2012, two years before Apple launched its software application at Silicon Valley, California on Tuesday. It has just themselves, a few application designers and some investors in its minnow operations compared to the US conglomerate. The Australian HealthKit version is designed to streamline health services for people online. It works by connecting health practitioners, such as doctors to clients to access health records, data and other useful information. Apple's HealthKit app lets users measure the body's performance when exercising, such as the heart rate, calories burned, blood sugar, cholesterol and keeps a record of that data all in one place. Speaking to MailOnline about the alleged copyright infringement, Ms Hardacre said: 'We won't let them trample over our product ... someone needs to be fired for this.' 'We have a business with the same name and a similar product, if they had done a quick Google search they (Apple) would have seen that. It's not fair.' Apple CEO Tim Cook launching the IOS 8 version of it's Apple product, and a new health app which shares the same name as Australia's HealthKit . A look at the Australian version's website welcoming vistors to its page . While Apple said its version will 'revolutionise' health, Ms Hardacre has other ideas. She and her business partner said they were considering it's options over whether they would sue. She also said repeated attempts to contact the company have gone unanswered. MailOnline has also attempted to contact Apple over the allegations, without success. 'We knew Apple were going into health but didn't expect this,' she said. The morning she found out about the alleged thievery of the company name, she posted to a blog on the company's website: 'HealthKit is already in use, by us! Apple's HealthKit app icon, which it launched on Tuesday in California . Ms Hardacre said any reasonable company, let alone Apple, would have taken steps to ensure that a name is not already in use. A quick Google search would have returned the Australian HealthKit at the top of the search engine's list. 'it would have taken five seconds to type www.healthkit.com into their browser and discover us. Would it have made any difference to them? Are they so big that they are above doing an ordinary Google search?' 'This is just not right. We have had these great ambitions to make health better for customers.' It is not the first time Apple has been embroiled in allegations of trademark-infringement. In 2010 the company settled with Cisco, a company that designs, manufactures, and sells networking equipment, over a trademark-infringement lawsuit for the use of the iPhone name. Cisco sued the company after Apple unveiled its long-awaited multimedia phone, a name already claimed by the network equipment maker. Apple was also embroiled in a legal stoush with Apple Corps, the music company owned by the Beatles, between 1978 and 2006 over the use of the Apple name. The two companies settled for an undisclosed price back in 2007. Ms Hardacre said at the very least Apple should 'apologise'.  'As an Apple fan, I feel let down.'","Apple launched new I0S8 software, including HealthKit app on Tuesday .

"By . Associated Press . Conventional wisdom suggests the Burt behind Burt's Bees left the company after he became disillusioned with the corporate world in North Carolina and wanted to return to his solitary life in Maine. The reality, Burt Shavitz says, is that he was forced out by co-founder Roxanne Quimby, his after he had an affair with a 'college aged' employee. So the man on the Burt's Bees logo that promises 'Earth-friendly natural personal care products' ended up with 37 acres in Maine, and an undisclosed sum of money. Scroll down for video . Burt Shavitz, the Burt behind Burt's Bees, still lives in rural Maine after leaving the company that was later sold for millions by his former business partner, Roxanne Quimby . But Shavitz refused to speak of his relationship with co-founder Roxanne Quimby (pictured) but said he was forced out after having an affair with an employee . Burt's Bees Hand Salve is one of the many personal care products produce by the Earth-friendly company . And he's not complaining. 'In the long run, I got the land, and land is everything. Land is positively everything. And money is nothing really worth squabbling about. This is what puts people six feet under. You know, I don't need it,' he told a filmmaker on property where the company was launched in the 1980s. The reclusive beekeeper whose simple life became complicated by his status as a corporate icon is now the subject of a documentary, 'Burt's Buzz,' which opens Friday in cities including New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, Phoenix and Cleveland. Interviewed by The Associated Press on his land in Maine, Shavitz declined to discuss his relationship with Quimby. 'What I have in this situation is no regret,' he said, sitting in a rocking chair. 'The bottom line is she's got her world and I've got mine, and we let it go at that.' Shavitz, 79, grew up around New York, served in the Army in Germany and shot photos for Time-Life before leaving New York for the backwoods of Maine. He was a hippie making a living by . selling honey when his life was altered by a chance encounter with a . hitchhiking Quimby. She was a single mother and a back-to-the-lander who . impressed Shavitz with her ingenuity and self-sufficiency. Burt Shavitz has long been the face behind the Earth-friendly personal care product Burt's Bees . She began making products from his beeswax, and they became partners. An image of Burt's face - and his untamed beard - was featured on labels. The partnership ended on a sour note after the business moved in 1994 to North Carolina, where it continued to expand before Shavitz was given the boot. In the documentary, Shavitz sounds both bitter and ambivalent. 'Roxanne Quimby wanted money and power, and I was just a pillar on the way to that success,' he said. Quimby, who made more than $300 million when she sold the company, disagrees with any suggestion that Shavitz was treated improperly. Burt Shavitz stands on his property in Parkman, Maine where he still resides  after leaving the company that was later sold for millions by his former business partner, Roxanne Quimby . A chalkboard with a quote inside Burt Shavitz's property in Maine which he says is all he ever wanted . 'Everyone associated with the company was treated fairly, and in some cases very generously, upon the sale of the company and my departure as CEO. And that, of course, includes Burt,' she said in an email to the AP. Shavitz lives in a cluttered house that has no hot water; he used to live in a converted turkey coop on the same property. He still likes to watch nature pass by. All manner of critters traipse across the land: deer, moose, pine martens, even a pack of cacophonous coyotes. On a recent day, six baby foxes played in the field. 'Golly dang!' he exclaimed, his blue eyes gazing. His humble life is a long way from the one where he stays in four-star hotels during promotional trips. The movie juxtaposes his ideal day, one in which he's left alone, against a trip to Taiwan, where he was greeted like a rock star by fans wearing faux beards and bee costumes. Director Jody Shapiro said his documentary presents contrasts: a man who wants a simple life but also likes to travel and experience new things; a vegetarian who likes to shoot guns; a man who's content to sell honey but also helped launch a big business. He described Shavitz as 'an authentic character' but still isn't sure what makes him tick. 'After hanging out with him for a year, I stopped searching,' he said. 'Is he more complicated, or am I trying to make him more complicated?' Shavitz doesn't plan to change a thing. He has his three golden retrievers. And he has his land. 'I had no desire to be an upward-mobile-rising yuppie with a trophy wife, a trophy house, a trophy car. I wasn't looking for any of those things. I already had what I wanted,"" he said in the documentary. 'No one has ever accused me of being ambitious,' he joked. Burt Shavitz rests inside his camp on his property in Parkman, Maine which he says makes him happier than money ever would .","Burt Shavitz, 79, was left with 37 acres of land in Maine and an undisclosed amount of money after being asked to leave Burt's Bees .

"By . Dan Bloom . A driver for the wildly popular car service app Uber has been arrested after a passenger woke up in a motel room miles from her home. Police said Frederick Dencer, 32, took off his shirt and 'fondled' through the 26-year-old's clothes after driving her 17 miles from a nightclub in West Hollywood, California. She rejected his advances and dialled 911 from a nearby convenience store the next morning, they said - and when officers arrived Dencer was still in the room. Scroll down for video . Motel: Police say a woman woke up in this motel in Panorama City, California, after being given a ride by Uber driver Frederick Dencer, 32. He was arrested on suspicion of kidnap for the purpose of sexual assault . Distance: The woman had been at the Greystone Manor nightclub in West Hollywood, 17 miles away. Police said the booking was not made through normal channels and the woman could not remember her address . The driver was arrested on suspicion of kidnap for the purpose of sexual assault. No actual sexual assault allegation was made. 'Once in the car she couldn't express her address, where she lived', LAPD Lt Paul Vernon told ABC7. 'He ends up taking her to this motel miles from her home, miles from his home... There . was some fondling through her clothes, suggesting what he wanted. 'She . said no, and in the morning when she awoke and she wanted to leave he . did not stop her from leaving. 'After several stories he confirms that he is an Uber driver.' The woman had ended her night at the Greystone Manor nightclub in West Hollywood after a night drinking in bars. It was initially thought she had called the car share service herself. However, investigators believe staff at the nightclub may have hailed down Dencer after he dropped off another fare as a means for her to get home. Investigation: LAPD Lt Paul Vernon said it was believed the woman was unable to articulate her address . Route: Police said the woman was taken from the Greystone Manor nightclub to the Panorama Motel . That would mean he had not been given her home address through the firm - and if she had been unable to articulate it herself, he would not know where to take her, Lt Vernon said. Police said surveillance video showed Dencer, from nearby Encino, carrying . the woman into a room at the Panorama Motel in Panorama City. Uber popular: Leaked figures suggest the car service app carries 800,000 people a week . They claimed he 'took advantage of the situation'. Uber said it has suspended the account of Dencer, who was held in custody with bail of $1million. A statement released by the firm said: 'The facts are unknown at this stage and it's certainly unclear that this is an Uber-related incident. 'We have reached out to authorities and will work with them to help uncover the facts. 'It is also our policy to immediately suspend a driver's account following any serious allegations, which we have done. Nothing is more important to Uber than the safety of our riders.' The car service app has soared in popularity in the four years since it launched in San Francisco. It uses networks of drivers in major cities and allows users to book a taxi with the touch of a button on their smartphone. Its meteoric rise has led to criticism in some countries where it has been accused of undercutting the established taxi industry. In London, experienced drivers of traditional black cabs - who have to study for several years to memorise every street in the city - complained it could put them out of business. Figures leaked to TechCrunch in December suggested the app, which has now spread to 36 countries, was regularly pulling in more than 800,000 rides a week.

"By . Chris Pleasance . A student designer has used a 3D printer to create an . intricate prosthetic arm for one of his classmates, taking 45 hours to . print it out. Evan Kuester, 23, made the arm for Ivania Castillo as part of a design competition at Savannah College, Georgia. Kuester decided to make the limb for 21-year-old Ivania, despite never having spoken to her before. Evan Kuester (left) made an intricate prosthetic arm for Ivania Castillo (right), who was born without a hand, as part of a design competition. It took 45 hours to print using a 3D printer . Evan Kuester made this intricate prosthetic limb for Ivania Castillo as part of a design competition. It took 45 hours to print using a 3D printer . While Ivania, who was born . without a hand, was initially taken back by the offer, curiosity got the . better of her and she agreed. Kuester took pictures of her arm from every angle to fit the design around, then used computer software to apply the fine circular details to the outside of the arm. He also made part of it hollow, allowing sunlight to pass through or for a light bulb to be placed inside. He then printed the arm over 45 hours using a 3D printer which cost $200 (£120). While it has limited practical uses, Kuester says it was designed more as a piece of jewellery than as an everyday prosthetic. The arm has an interlocking pattern running . across the surface and a hollow centre allowing light to pass through or . a light bulb to be placed inside . The arm was designed using computer software and cost £200 to make. Despite not speaking before the project, Kuester and Ivania are now firm friends . Evan said: 'I’ve always wanted to design a prosthetic arm for as long as I can remember so the contest was the push I needed to finally make one. 'I wanted it to be designed to take advantage of the possibilities available to the world of prosthetics. 'This piece was inspired by unique design opportunities only available to a select few. 'With user defined parameters, each design will be inherently different from the next in style, size and need. 'Ivania is one of the first prosthetics to work with the concept of a prosthetics as decoration.' Ivania, from Miami, Florida, added: 'My initial reaction to the entire conversation was confusion - as Evan and I had never spoken to each another. The arm was meant to be decorative, but does have limited practical uses such as holding a glass of wine . 'I decided to go along with it because I was curious to see what would come out of it and it’s not every day a complete stranger comes up to you and offers to design you a custom prosthetic. 'When Evan told me the arm had finished printing I was beyond excited to see it. 'He promised I’d be the first to see it and when I did I couldn’t believe the intricacy and level of detail it had - I was in awe. 'I immediately tried it on and we were both relieved to find out that it fit me perfectly.'","Evan Kuester, 23, used a 3D printer to create an intricate prosthetic arm .

"By . David Mccormack . A high school principal was met with cheers on Wednesday when he came out as gay to his students at his Washington D.C. school’s annual pride event. Principal Pete Cahall, who recently turned 50, shed a tear as he attempted to control his emotions in front of his students at Woodrow Wilson High School. ‘I have hid in the shadows for the last 50 years,’ said Cahall, who has been principal at the school for six years. Principal Pete Cahall, who recently turned 50, shed a tear as he attempted to control his emotions in front of his students at Wilson High School . ‘To date, I have not made this declaration because I did not want my kids to think of me differently or not respect me,’ he said. ‘Those fears were obstacles in my mind because of the culture of when and where I grew up.’ Cahall also paid tribute to his students and to D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray who was on stage with him at the time. The lunchtime Pride Day event was also attended by David Catania, the D.C. Council’s first openly gay member. On stage with Cahall was D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray, left, and David Catania, the D.C. Council's first openly gay member, right . Catania, who came out when he was 20, told the Washington Post that he understood the 'silent, quiet, isolating sense of desperation' of keeping one’s true sexual orientation a secret. He commented that Cahall’s announcement was about more than acceptance, that it was also about honesty. 'I think this is the most important lesson that these students will learn this year,' he said. Mayor Gray congratulated Cahall on his coming out and encouraged students to follow suit in being their true selves, saying, 'There is nothing worse than walking around having to hide who you are.' Cahall poses with students at Wilson High School in Washington D.C. after making his big announcement . The school held its second annual Pride . Day event on Wednesday, bringing together over 20 organizations that . support the needs of LGBTQ youth. Westboro Baptist Church, known for its public crusade against gay people at military funerals, announced plans to protest the school's Pride celebration on June 9 and called the school's support of gay and lesbian students a 'shame.' Around 1,000 students have volunteered to participate in a silent counter-protest. Video: Watch Principal Cahall's address . Cahall has been principal at Woodrow Wilson High School for six years . ‘Mayor Gray, Councilmembers, scholars and guests, I am Principal Cahall. Welcome to the second annual Capitol Gay Pride Day at Wilson High School. ‘Mayor Gray, I want to thank you for your consistent support and action on behalf of the LGBTQ community. 'You have led the way to allow members of our LGBTQ community to be full partners in our city. 'You have been relentless and absolute for ensuring equity for all people of our city, the nation’s capitol city, and setting the bar for acceptance, inclusion, and full membership into the city’s culture and daily life as valued citizens of Washington, D.C. ‘A few weeks ago, I turned 50 years old. This was a watershed time for me and you have influenced what I would like to announce today. I have hid in the shadows for the last 50 years. Your leadership has given me the courage and inspiration to say what I need and must say today. ‘As a former athlete, people like Jason Collins and Michael Sam have given me the inspiration to say what I want to announce today. 'Since being at Wilson, I have been inspired by my colleagues Alex Wilson, Julie Caccamise, Rob Geremia, Michael Garbus and Chris Obermeyer. I have felt the love and support of the greater Wilson and DCPS community for our LGBTQ members including Councilmember Catania. ‘But the critical factor for me as the principal has been that I have been inspired by my students. ‘To date, I have not made this declaration because I did not want my kids to think of me differently or not respect me. Those fears were obstacles in my mind because of the culture of when and where I grew up. ‘Mayor Gray, you have led the way and set the circumstances that I could never imagine as a high school student or high school principal to say what I want to say today. ‘I have hid in the shadows, but I am liberated today to be me and let myself be me without fear, retaliation or consequence. I feel safe and want all of my students and staff to be and feel safe. ‘I have used this quote from a Lady Gaga song before but think that it is absolutely appropriate today: “No matter gay straight or bi/ Lesbian, transgendered life/ I’m on the right track baby/ I was born to survive/ No matter black, white or beige/ Chola or orient made/ I’m on the right track baby/ I was born to be brave.” 'Mayor Gray, I want to say publicly for the first time, because of your leadership, care and support, that I am a proud gay man who just happens to be the principal of Wilson High School.’","Pete Cahall has been the principal at  Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington D.C. for six years .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A woman from Tippencanoe County in Indiana allegedly had been living with her husband's decomposing body for nine months before he was discovered dead and rotting in doorway of their home, . Tippecanoe County Coroner Donna Avolt said on Tuesday that 88-year-old veteran Gerald Francus Gavan Jr. died over nine months before his decomposing body was discovered on May 3. Neighbors of the Lafayette veteran say his wife Ila Solomon acted as though Gavan was not dead and they were shocked to hear that a forensic entomologist would be testifying in court that Gavan's death occurred on July 15th or sometime before. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tippecanoe County Coroner Donna Avolt said on Tuesday that 88-year-old veteran Gerald Francus Gavan Jr. died over nine months before his decomposing body was discovered at this Indiana home on May 3 . Neighbor Tom Vaughan told WLFI that Solomon was a nice woman, but she frequently told unbelievable stories and even claimed that Gavan was at the Kentucky Derby the day he was found dead . The Mail Online spoke with John Withers of the Lafayette Police Department who said that officers were sent to the home on a well-being call because a friend of Gavan had been trying to get in touch with him to invited him to his birthday party. When the friend wasn't able to get a hold of Gavan he called the police who then discovered Gavan's rotting body. 'It's really disturbing,' said neighbor Tyler Imel to the Indy Star, 'the fact that we've been living here the whole time and talking to her.' Imel's roommate Joe Childs said that Ila Solomon was 'friendly' and that she would leave her house on a regular basis. 'If I lived with a dead body in my house, I couldn't compose myself the way that she did every day,' said Childs. Neighbor Tom Vaughan told WLFI that Solomon was a nice woman, but she frequently told unbelievable stories and even claimed that Gavan was at the Kentucky Derby the day he was found dead. Solomon said on Tuesday that her husband was not dead for nine months and that he suffered a small stroke on April 28. She said that the coroner was not right about the date of her husband's death and that the dry environment of her home in addition to a pest problem made it seem like he were dead for longer than he actually was. Solomon says that her husband's body . decomposed faster than usual because of flies, rodents, and . dehumidifiers that her husband kept around for woodworking projects. 'I think that there is enough proof and evidence that that's not true,' Solomon said. Tippecanoe County Coroner Donna Avolt said on Tuesday that 88-year-old veteran Gerald Francus Gavan Jr. (not pictured)  died over nine months before his decomposing body was discovered on May 3 . Solomon said that a pungent odor from her husband's body forced her to sleep in the house she owns next door during the five days she claims he was dead. When asked why she didn't report his death to the authorities she said, 'I would love to answer,"" she said. 'I would love to tell you. I really, really would.' She said that her husband wanted to follow a tradition he heard about in India in which human bodies are put on a hill for birds to eat. She said her husband wanted a , 'bird's eye view' of his death. She said that she was planning on transporting his corpse to a 'body ranch' in Texas where researchers study vultures feeding on bodies. 'I love Scooter,' Solomon said. 'There's nothing I wouldn't do for him.' She says that the flies came from fertilizer in the house and that the rodents were meant to be fed to Gavan's snakes who are now missing. The forensic entomologist Avolt said that she was able to identify Gavan's body by matching the screws and metal plate in his leg that matched medical records. Gavan's cause of death is unknown but Avolt says that a toxicology report will point to more answers. 'Once toxicology is done,' she said, 'then I can issue cause and manner.' An ongoing investigation by law enforcement is underway. No charges have been issued as of yet.","Coroner Donna Avolt .

"By . Ashley Collman . It has been revealed that Ronald Reagan secretly feared his son was gay when the younger Ron dropped out of Yale in 1976 to become a ballet dancer. Novelist Christopher Buckley, whose father William F Buckley was close with the 40th president, revealed Reagan's fears in a recent Q&A published by the Lincoln Center Theater program. 'My father and Reagan were close, and my dad had always acted as a kind of godfather to the Reagan children, so Reagan called up my dad and expressed to him his worry that this meant that his son played for the other team,' Buckley said. 'My dad ventured the opinion that all people in the arts might not be gay, but there wasn’t much he could really say about this, and, of course, we now know Ron’s not gay.' Worries: Ronald Reagan (left) allegedly feared his son Ron (right) was gay when he dropped out of Yale in 1976 to become a ballet dancer.

Over the years, their feelings toward Doria warmed, but initially they questioned her intentions since she was seven years Ron's senior.

Before his marriage, Ron's sexuality was a large question mark and one the former president's critics used against him during his time in office. The Reagan administration was blamed for their slow response to the AIDs epidemic, which painted the president as homophobic since many believed his son was a closeted gay man. But Ron has always dealt with the rumors in good humor. 'I'm gay and I'm rich,' Ron joked to the Seattle Times in an 2011 interview. 'Ron Reagan - rich gay man unaccountably married to the same woman for 30 years.' The younger Reagan was lauded for his dancing skills, and performed with the world-renowned Joffrey Ballet.

"By . David Mccormack . America’s first female astronaut, Sally Ride, was a brilliant physicist who broke through NASA’s glass ceiling before going on to devote her life to inspiring girls to take up science. But it wasn’t until after Ride's death in July 2012, following a 17-month battle with pancreatic cancer, that the world – and most people who knew her – discovered that she had been living with a woman for 27 years. Ride’s sexuality is one of number of secrets revealed in a new book, Sally Ride: America’s First Woman In Space, written by former ABC News correspondent Lynn Sherr. Scroll down for video . America¿s first female astronaut, Sally Ride, was a brilliant physicist who broke through NASA¿s glass ceiling before going on to devote her life to inspiring girls to take up science . The two women became close friends in the early 1980s when Sherr was covering the space program for ABC News. The biography also explores the chronic shyness that caused Ride to seek psychiatric help amid the overwhelming public attention that surrounded her return from space in 1983. Despite her shyness, Ride attended a secret meeting with a Russian female cosmonaut at the height of the Cold War, against strict orders from the State Department. Later, during the investigation into the Challenger explosion in 1986, Ride acquired and then leaked a key document showing that NASA management had prior knowledge of the faulty equipment believed to have led to the disaster. Sally Ride, left, and Tam O-Shaughnessy were lovers for 27 years even though many of Ride's friends only discovered she was a lesbian after her death in 2012. In this 2008 photo they are discussing the role of women in science . ‘She was the person I thought she was,’ Sherr told the L.A. Times. ‘But she was much more. She had so much more to her.’ Like most people, Sherr only learned about Ride’s 27 year relationship with her partner, Tam O'Shaughnessy, after the former astronaut died of pancreatic cancer in 2012, aged just 61 years old. 'Sally was very good at keeping secrets,' writes Sherr on her book. Despite spending much of her life on the public stage, Ride was an introvert and fiercely private person. She and O'Shaughnessy first met in . their teens when both were aspiring tennis players, although Ride had several relationships with men before the friends started an intimate relationship. According . to O'Shaughnessy, the couple kept their relationship a secret throughout . Ride’s life for fear it wouldn’t be accepted and concern over the . impact it would have on their business. The pair co-founded Sally Ride Science, a program aimed at encouraging young girls to explore science, in 2001. Ride’s sexuality is one of number of secrets revealed in a new book, Sally Ride: America’s First Woman In Space, written by former ABC News correspondent Lynn Sherr, right . 'We both lived through Billie Jean's . horrors, of being gay and being in the public eye. And we both were . afraid it would hurt the business. So we elected to be private about . it.' Tam O'Shaughnessy, Sally Ride's lover . 'Corporate America is really nervous about gay women,' O'Shaughnessy told Sherr. 'When we started Sally Ride Science, we were just worried that it would affect the growth of the company, the sponsorships. 'We both lived through Billie Jean's horrors, of being gay and being in the public eye. And we both were afraid it would hurt the business. So we elected to be private about it.' Like many . gay people of their generation, both Ride and O'Shaughnessy felt . uncomfortable about openly expressing their sexuality in public. 'We . never publicly said, ""We're gay."" We didn't like labels of any kind, . but especially the ones referring to sexuality: queer, lesbian, . homosexual,' said O'Shaughnessy. The couple were good friends with Billie Jean King, who was outed in 1981, although the former tennis star tells Sherr that Ride never asked what effect coming out had had on King's career. 'Never. I thought it was weird,' said King. 'Selfishly I thought it would be . great if Sally came out, and if Tam came out, but I knew they weren't . there. I thought it would be great for an example of being gay and . powerful and all the wonderful things, to be yourself and to be . authentic.' 'But it's easy for me to say, I'm in a different place. When you're not in that place, you're just frightened.' Returning hero: Ride gets a big hug from her astronaut husband Steven Hawley. The couple divorced after five years of marriage. 'I believe that Sally did love me when we got married,' he said . Ride left NASA in 1987 and in 2001 she co-founded the Sally Ride Science, a program aimed at encouraging young girls to explore science, along with her partner . Ride’s overwhelming need for privacy is a reoccurring theme throughout the book. Sherr describes her as a 'resolutely guarded' person and writes that ‘while Tam (O'Shaughnessy) kept nothing from her best buddies, Sally told no one, not even the insiders.’ A friend of O'Shaughnessy says that around other people a lot of the relationship ‘was about looks and actions, not words.’ 'I never heard Sally say, ""I love you,"" to Tam,’ said Kay Loveland. ‘But you could tell they were in love by the way they would touch each other when they'd go by.’ Although the 'superb compartmentalizer' Ride never publicly acknowledged her sexuality and her relationship with O'Shaughnessy, the situation was different away from the spotlight. Among their close group of friends - gay and straight - the couple were far from closeted. They regularly traveled together, staying together in hotels and attending public functions together, even attending each other's university events. The pair also wore matching rings - each on the fourth finger of their left hand. Friends: Former tennis star Billie Jean King said Ride never asked her about what effect coming out had had on her career. 'I thought it was weird,' said King . While still a student at Stanford University, Ride was one of 8,000 people who answered an advertisement in the student newspaper seeking applicants for the space program. She was chosen to join NASA in 1978 and while she excelled at her work, her 'fiercely private' nature meant she struggled with the media attention that descended upon her after she was selected as America’s first female astronaut. During press conferences, she was asked questions like, ‘Will the flight affect your reproductive organs?’ and ‘Do you weep when things go wrong on the job?’ Despite this and the historical significance of the mission, Ride insisted that she saw herself in only one way - as an astronaut. A good example of Ride’s desire for privacy was her marriage in 1982, a year before her first flight, to fellow astronaut Steven Hawley. The couple got married in secret at his parent’s house and the media was only informed until a month later. Despite rumors that NASA had put pressure on Ride to marry ahead of her maiden space flight, her ex-husband denies it. On June 18, 1983, Ride, then 32, became the first American woman in space as a crew member on space shuttle Challenger for STS-7 . 'I believe that Sally did love me when we got married,' said Hawley, 'and that she entered the marriage in good faith.' The couple divorced five years later, just when Ride was leaving NASA, although they remained good friends throughout the rest of her life. On June 18, 1983, Ride became the first American woman in space as a crew member on space shuttle Challenger for STS-7. Aged 32, she was the first woman to use the robot arm in space and the first to use the arm to retrieve a satellite. She remains the youngest American astronaut to travel to space. The mission went off without a hitch, but the problems for Ride started when she returned to earth to discover that everybody wanted a piece of her. Not a comfortable situation for a 'fiercely private individual'. She was invited to the White House to meet President Regan and despite her reservations she carried out countless public appearances to help publicize the space program. But as an introvert, Ride felt traumatized by all the public attention and confided in O'Shaughnessy that she felt she was ‘losing her equilibrium.’ Tam O'Shaughnessy prepares to accept the Presidential Medal of Freedom on behalf of Dr. Sally Ride from President Obama at the White House last November. Ride was awarded the highest civilian honor posthumously after she died from cancer in 2012 . 'I felt anxious and unsettled,' she told Tam. 'I knew I needed help.' In her personal memo book, Ride called the attention 'draining' and wrote that she felt better in New York City. She described walking in NYC as 'therapeutic' – ‘the freedom, exercise, anonymity, in the midst of crowds.' In a bid to cope she consulted a psychologist who ‘helped me figure out what to do.' The final straw for Ride came when she was asked to appear on a Bob Hope TV special. Blast Off With Bob was a tribute to NASA and Ride was adamant that she didn't want to appear on it. Telling her bosses 'I don't like the way he exploits women.’ In the end she went AWOL rather than appear alongside the showbiz legend. As an introvert, Ride felt traumatized by all the public attention that she received and she felt she was 'losing her equilibrium' Ride flew Challenger once again in 1984, but in 1986 the space shuttle tragically exploded 73 seconds after launch. She was the only serving astronaut appointed to the investigation committee. At the same time her marriage to Hawley started to come apart, and she secretly began her relationship with O'Shaughnessy. To have the personal life she wanted, Ride had to forge a career outside of NASA and she left the next year. ‘There is . no question in my mind that if Sally Ride had been openly gay and if she . had applied to NASA, number one, she never would have been selected as . an astronaut,' writes Sherr.","Sally Ride became America's first woman in space in 1983, aged 32 .

"By . Mark Prigg . Chemists in Singapore have unveiling a groundbreaking new instant test for the most popular date rape drug. The flourescent sensor can change the colour of drinks within second to warn people drugs have been added. It can detect Gamma-Hydroxybutyric (GHB), or 'liquid ecstasy', which can can make anyone fall into a deep sleep. The simple test for date rape drugs: GHB Orange, the fluorescent sensor for detecting date rape drug GHB (bottle in top left), under UV light with the drug GHB (bottle in top right), and when it was mixed into red wine without GHB (vial in front left) and with GHB (vial in front right) GHB was used as a central nervous system depressant to treat sleep disorders, promote fat reduction and muscle development, until it was banned for sale as a supplement in the US by the Food and Drug Administration. It is odourless and colourless, and can go undetected in anyone's glass. A small amount of the drug -- two to four grammes -- can make anyone fall into a deep sleep. Current tests for GHB are difficult to carry out, the researchers say. Professor Chang Young-Tae, from the Department of Chemistry at National University of Singapore, said: 'The current method in the market is using (a) kind of paper (a tissue-like piece of paper) and... run the paper chromatography separations. 'The problem is, to run those samples -- the paper chromatography -- it takes about 10 minutes of your time.' 'Currently, we are using the test tube kind of approach… but who would want to bring this (a test tube) to the discotheque?""' Scientists from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have now found a way for GHB to show itself instantaneously - by changing the colour of the drink. When the sensor is mixed with a sample of a beverage containing GHB, the mixture changes colour in less than 30 seconds, making detection of the drug fast and easy. The team shortlisted 17 fluorescent compounds and further tested them with a wide range of different GHB concentrations. Through this, the team identified that an orange fluorescent compound, coined GHB Orange, changes colour when it is mixed with GHB. In order to examine the efficiency of GHB Orange, the team tested its detection capability by mixing a small amount of it with samples of various beverages, ranging from alcoholic, non-alcoholic, coloured and colourless drinks, which contain GHB. drinks spiked with GHB are almost impossible to detect - but a new test claims to be able to make drinks change colour if it has been added . The test revealed differences in the fluorescence intensity between GHB-free and GHB-spiked beverages. For drinks that are translucent or of a light colour, such as water or vodka, the change in colour can be easily detected with the naked eye. The change in the colour of darker drinks, such as Cola and whiskey, requires the aid of additional lighting to better detect the change. The team now hope to develop a simple kit they can commercialise using the technology.","Singapore researchers say test can cause a drink to change colour in seconds .

"By . David Mccormack . WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES: A young girl from a remote Kenyan village has regained her confidence and smile after living in the U.S. for a year and undergoing a series of operations to help rebuild her face. When she younger, Saline Atieno's face was ravaged by a rare flesh-eating bacteria that made it difficult for her to speak, eat and even breathe. Last Saturday, a smiling and confident Saline, 12, returned home to Kenya after undergoing ten surgeries to reconstruct her face. Saline Atieno, 12, has regained her confidence and smile after New York doctor Dr. Leon Klempner carried out a series of operations to help rebuild her face over the past year . She is the first child to have had her life dramatically changed by the Smile Rescue Fund For Kids, a charity dedicated to helping children with facial deformities deemed virtually ‘untreatable’. It was setup by Dr. Leon Klempner, an orthodontist on the cleft palate team at Stony Brook University Hospital in Stony Brook, New York. After making numerous mission trips to provide free surgeries to repair cleft palates or other facial deformities in children around the world, he wanted to do more to help those children with the most severe deformities. ‘On every mission I’ve gone on there’s always been one or two kids turned away because they are too severe to be able to treat and that’s always bothered me,’ Klempner told FoxNews. When she younger, Saline Atieno's face was ravaged by a rare flesh-eating bacteria that made it difficult for her to speak, eat and even breathe . Saline was just 3-years-old when she was diagnosed with Noma. The flesh-eating bacteria develops in the mouth and ravages the faces of its victims by destroying the soft and bone tissues of the face. ‘Noma attacked her face, ate through her skin, through her upper jaw, destroyed her nose and destroyed her palate…That’s the medical part,’ said Klempner. ‘The social part is she was basically a recluse, she had no friends, she didn’t go to school.’ She first came to the attention of Dr. Klempner in 2010, but it took three years of fundraising and navigating bureaucratic barriers before Saline finally arrived in the U.S. for treatment last June. At first she was shy and afraid, and unwilling to show her face in public or look people in the eye. ‘We had to reconstruct a nose, an upper lip and a palate – and that was one big cavity, one big hole,’ Dr. Alexander Dagum, chief of the plastic and reconstructive surgery division at Stony Brook, told Fox. Dr. Leon Klempner, an orthodontist on the cleft palate team at Stony Brook University Hospital founded the Smile Rescue Fund for Kids to help children with facial deformities deemed 'untreatable' Before the operations, Saline was basically a recluse, who had no friends and didn't go to school . As Saline’s appearance began to improve, her doctors and host family noticed a marked improvement in both her health and self-esteem. She even grew six inches and learned to speak English. 'Here everyone is welcoming her, telling her she is beautiful, I think that all really played a part of getting her to come out of her shell,' said Jennifer Crean, who hosted Saline in her home for three months. Saline had her tenth major surgery - to create a nose - in April and then on May 31 she flew back to Kenya. She is now able to breathe normally, speak more clearly and eat without spilling food and drink from her mouth. Her risk for future infections has also decreased significantly now that the open cavity in her face has been closed. She may need a few corrective procedures to minimize scarring in the future. ‘No words can adequately express how I . feel. You have not only taught me your language, and fixed my face, you . have taught me how it feels to be taken care of and unconditionally . loved. I never expected that. Goodbye- for now,’ she told Dr. Klempner before leaving. Saline will be enrolled in a private . boarding school in Kenya, where she will receive an education, a bed to sleep . in and three meals per day – all funded by the Smile Rescue . Fund. ‘She’s touched our lives and exposed us . to what exists elsewhere and instilled this sense of gratitude in those . of us that have been involved with her,’ said Dr. Klempner. 'She’s been . an inspiration to us and really a gift, she’s enriched our lives.' With Saline’s journey almost at an end, Dr. Klempner is in the process of screening more children to bring to the U.S. for similar reconstructive surgeries.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Toronto's crack-smoking mayor Rob Ford has released a picture on himself taking a dip in the pool at his rehab clinic. He also announced plans to be out the clinic on June 31 so he can launch his reelection campaign on July 1 - Canada Day. Ford has been at the Greenestone facility, in Ontario, since checking himself in on May 1 after another drunken rant was caught on camera. Rob Ford, the mayor of Toronto who was filmed last year smoking crack cocaine, has been picture enjoying a swim at his GreeneStone rehab clinic in Ontario . Ford said today that he plans to be back at home on July 1 when he will launch his reelection campaign (pictured at Toronto town hall in November 2013) Speaking to the Toronto Sun, he said: 'I will be back, I guarantee you. I am coming back and you will see a different Rob Ford.' Speaking about his time in the clinic, Ford said he has been able to work out, relax and make some friends, though confesses he has been missing his family. The only time he has seen his wife and children was for a trip to Crabby Joe's on his birthday, and he adds that he is anxious to get back to them. On the subject of his addiction, he acknowledges that it is his own fault. He said: 'No one has enabled me. We were talking about the enabling thing the other day in a meeting. You do booze or drugs because you want to do it. 'I take full responsibility. I have learned my lesson.' Ford was pictured looking glum outside the clinic last month, wearing an orange sweater, jeans and Crocs . 'I feel good. You are going to see a difference. You are going to see a healthier Rob Ford and I am going to win the election on Oct. 27.' The picture is the first time Ford has been seen inside the clinic, though last month he was pictured outside wearing . a bright orange Texas Longhorns sweater, jeans and Crocs. On that occasion, 44-year-old looked glum during the brisk stroll, despite earlier . calling the luxurious rehabilitation center 'amazing' and saying it . reminded him of 'football camp'. A week before that, he was seen in Bracebridge, which is about 25 miles east of the center. He was seen chatting with local residents, many of whom snapped pictures with him and posted them online. In a bizarre twist, he also made headlines last month when a former fellow resident at the clinic, 36-year-old LeeAnne Rob, was charged with drink-driving his SUV. She also suggested that she had left her watch in his room, although the has since refused to comment on the nature of their relationship. Glum: Ford kept his head down as he took the paths at the center last month, which is just north of Toronto . Reflection: He kept his head down as he walked along the path at GreeneStone Clinic in Ontario . He's . is allowed to leave the clinic to run personal errands such as banking, . but otherwise he's in treatment '24/7,' his lawyer Dennis Morris told the National Post. Ford previously declared that 'rehab is amazing' and that it reminded him . of 'football camp'. Speaking to the Toronto Sun at the start of the month, Ford said he feels 'great' and is benefiting from the . self-imposed exile. 'It . reminds me of football camp. Kind of like the Washington Redskins camp I . went to as a kid,' he said, adding 'I am working out every day and I am . learning about myself, my past and things like that.' Luxury: Ford previously claimed that his rehab was costing $100,000 - and said it was worth every cent . Residence: The clinic has 'treetop cottages and executive townhouses' with 'rustic suites', its website says . He . joked 'on October 28 there will be no need to change the locks. There . will be no need to clean out my office because I am coming back.' He said the very public fall from grace - including a video of him smoking crack, being filmed while drunk and making lewd comments about his wife - was what he needed to shake him into action. 'I do feel bad about what happened, but it might have been the best thing that happened because I am working on getting better,' he told the Sun reporter. He . said the decision to check himself into rehab came on April 29 - the . morning after he was taped in an apparent intoxicated state at a city . pub. During the rant, he also claimed he was 'in a divorce' and staying at a hotel. He has been married to wife Renata since 2000. Out and about: Ford, 44, has been spotted in the nearby town of Bracebridge, where he has posed for photographs with fans. He has not said how long he will remain there . Out of control: Ford (pictured in January with Toronto's chief budget officer) found himself in deep water last year when a video emerged of him using crack cocaine. Others emerged of his drunken tirades . The . same day Ford announced his leave of absence, the Globe and Mail . published screen grabs of a new video which shows Ford smoking the . illegal drug at his sister's house on April 26 before apparently checking into GreenStone. On the centres website, it says: 'Located in a resort setting in scenic Muskoka, Ontario and equipped with holistic spa services, delicious, nutritious and seasonal menus offered through our Lodge Restaurant, and a full suite of fitness and recreation facilities.' Its accommodation consist of 'treetop cottages and executive townhouses' that 'feature rustic suites.' Ford previously indicated to the Toronto Sun that his treatment could cost as much as $100,000. 'It’s worth every dime, every dime,' he said. 'A hundred grand is cheap. It’s a steal.'","Rob Ford has released a picture of himself taking a swim at rehab clinic .

"By . Sally Lee . A Chinese-born Australian artist has reportedly been arrested in China following his recent media interview about the student-led protest and military crackdown in June 1989, also known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Although Australian authorities are yet to confirm whether Guo Jian has been detained by police, it is believed the 52-year-old made contact with friends via text message to inform them that he'd been taken from his home in eastern Beijing on Sunday night. The former soldier has also caused a stir with his latest art work - a diorama of Tiananmen Square covered in 160kg of minced pork. Chinese-Australian artist Guo Jian reportedly contacted friends by text message to inform them that he had been arrested by police in Beijing and will be detained until June 15 . The alleged arrests follows the former soldier's recent media interview about the student protest and military crackdown 25 years ago at Beijing's Tiananmen Square . The alleged arrest comes after a profile of Guo, a former protester in China's 1989 pro-democracy movement, appeared in the Financial Times newspaper on May 30 in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the military crackdown on the student protest centered around the large city square. The article also featured images of his latest installation 'The Square' covered in ground meat - which had turned a greyish green hue due to the hot weather - was created by the artist as he 'wanted to do something privately to mark the anniversary'. Guo was also highly critical of the People's Liberation Army's actions during the 1989 incident. 'The army is regarded as a loveable institution. But at Tiananmen I realised it’s not, they will kill you if ordered to. And how do they build up this machine? In part, they use women,' he said in the interview. Discussions of the protest and its military suppression are taboo in China as authorities tighten security ahead of the anniversary each year. Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the Australian embassy in Beijing was attempting to confirm with Chinese authorities that the former soldier had been detained. 'As an Australian citizen, we'll do what we can to release him if the case is he's been detained,' she told Sky News television in the Australian capital, Canberra. An Associated Press reporter spoke to the controversial artist as he was taken away from his home in suburban Beijing on Sunday night. Guo also told friends he would be held by police until June 15. 'The Square' is covered in 160kg of pork mince which was created by the artist as he 'wanted to do something privately to mark the anniversary' The student-led protest and military crackdown in June 1989 also became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre . This is the latest in a string of detentions of artists, lawyers, scholars and journalists ahead of the Tiananmen anniversary amid intense government efforts to deter coverage by foreign media of its remembrance. After a stint as a soldier, Guo was studying art in Beijing when he was swept into the 1989 student protests and witnessed the military action that began on the night of June 3, 1989. 'I didn't believe it, even though I had been a soldier,' Guo said in the article. 'In the army I had never seen that sort of violence. Then I saw the tracers and people falling around me - they were just gone.' This year's suppression has been harsher than in previous years, as police round up activists who had received no more than warnings in the past. The ground meat had turned a greyish green hue due to the hot weather in Beijing . Guo's Excitement Sideshow – Qi Gong exhibited in 1995 (left) and in 1997 (right) An untitled oil on canvas art piece which was exhibited in 2012 . Trigger Happy exhibited at National Gallery of Australia, Canberra in 1999 . Since early May, the authorities have detained or put under house arrest dozens of people, including prominent human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang, in an attempt to prevent any commemoration. Other activists have been warned by the authorities not to speak to foreign media. Police also have cautioned foreign journalists not to cover any sensitive issues leading up to the anniversary or face 'serious consequences'. A French broadcaster said its journalists were interrogated for six hours by Beijing police when they were found interviewing people on the street about the events 25 years ago. The journalists were forced to say in front of a police video camera that they did something 'very sensitive' that could cause 'disturbance', and promise not to do it in the next several days, before police returned their press cards, the broadcaster said. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China condemned the practices and called for them to halt. Guo has since removed the minced pork on his miniature model as the meat had rotten. Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the Australian embassy in Beijing was attempting to confirm with Chinese authorities that the former soldier had been detained. He is pictured at his Sydney show in 2004 .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Arjen Robben and Jermain Lens scored as Holland beat Wales 2-0. Robin van Persie must see a doctor to ascertain the extent of a groin injury that forced him to go off with a grimace at half-time of Netherlands’ friendly with Wales in Amsterdam. It gives Louis van Gaal cause for concern with their World Cup opener against Spain less than ten days away. The Dutch boss said the problem could have got worse had Van Persie stayed on and added: ‘He has to wait until the doctor sees him. It was better than you don’t risk a bigger injury by playing him in the second as it was not the most important match. Injury scare: Holland striker Robin van Persie was taken off at half time with a potential groin injury . Assist: Van Persie's first-half shot was parried into the path of Arjen Robben who opened the scoring . Tussle: Van Persie fights for the ball with James Chester of Wales at the Amsterdam Arena . ‘It looks slight injury but it is not for nothing that you go off.’ Van . Gaal said he ‘hoped’ the Manchester United striker, who was not 100 per . cent fit in any case after missing six weeks towards the end of last . season with a knee injury, would be fit for the Spain game. Van . Persie tried to play down the scare last night and said: ‘I came off as . a precaution. It built up during the came so decided it was sensible to . come off.’ Van Persie’s . importance to his country was illustrated by the way their attack became . blunted in the second half, although his replacement Jeremain Lens did . score a tap-in with 14 minutes to go to make the final score 2-0. Arjen Robben had scored the opener in the first half by converting a rebound from a Van Persie shot. Wales . manager Chris Coleman will be warmed by the way his team, without . Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Ashley Williams, tested the hosts at times . and could have given their travelling something to cheer had a couple . of openings been finished more accurately. Much . was made in the build-up to this game of Van Gaal’s decision to switch . to a 5-3-2 system from Holland’s usual 4-3-3. He trialled it in their . previous friendly against Ghana last Saturday prompting Bert van . Marwijk, the man who led his nation to the World Cup final four years . ago, to question the wisdom of changing tactics so close to the . tournament starting. Decisive: Arjen Robben scored one and made one for Holland in their win against Wales . Number one: Robben celebrates after giving Holland a first-half lead against Wales in Amsterdam . There . might be more sniping to come given Van Gaal sprung a surprise by opting . for a 4-4-2 diamond formation here. With Robben, Van Persie and Wesley . Sneijder purring, as was the case last night, their positioning . shouldn’t matter though. In . the 25th minute Robben played a one-two with Sneijder then jinked past . Danny Gabbidon only to continue tip-toeing too long so when he fired his . shot James Chester was able to clear off the line. In . the 32nd minute he did not wait to pull the trigger. Van Persie beat . Chris Gunter on the left and cracked a shot that Hennessey could only . divert into the path of Robben who struck instantly. Van . Persie could have made it two soon after but he sliced his effort just . wide after being teed up by Daley Blind. It was to be the last act in . his game, replaced at half-time by Lens with cameras picking up a wince . that will make Dutch fans do just the same. The . Dynamo Kiev forward did add gloss to Holland’s win by slotting in at . the far post after a perfect cross from Robben, released by Sneijder, . but it is clear any absence of Van Persie will cast a huge shadow.

"By . John Hall . Germany is to modernise its army by introducing flexible working hours that allow soldiers to take time off during school holidays and offering on-barracks daycare services for their children. Defence Minister Ursula Von der Leyen said army bases will be fitted out with flat-screen TVs and minibars as part of of a €100million drive to make the armed forces more attractive to new recruits . The measures have been roundly attacked by army commanders, who described them as policies for 'sissies and wimps', with Ms Von der Leyen - Germany's first female defence minister - criticised for being out of touch with the real needs of the army. New era: Soldiers in the German army (pictured) will now be treated to extended leave during the school holidays and widescreen televisions in barracks as part of plans to 'modernise' the armed forces . General Harald Kujat, a retired former chief of staff of Germany’s armed forces, told Focus magazine that Ms Von der Leyen had no idea of the military, adding that her proposals were the ideas of a 'good housewife taking care of her children'. In a separate interview he said the German army's outdated equipment was of far greater concern than the childcare and entertainment needs of soldiers, the Telegraph reported. Germany's defence spending remains far behind that of other countries in Europe. The country spends only 1.3 per cent of its GDP on its military, despite having signed a Nato agreement saying each member state's defence spending must be at least 2 per cent. This has led to concern that Germany would struggle to defend itself if it came under attack - not least after US president Barack Obama urged . European Nato members to increase their military budgets in order to . defend against potential Russian aggression in Ukraine or the Baltic. Anger: Germany's first female defence minister Ursula Von der Leyen (pictured) has been criticised for being out of touch with the real needs of the army. One commander said her policies were for 'sissies and wimps' Ms Von der Leyen's €100million recruitment drive has therefore caused anger among those who have long demanded more money be made available to modernise weapons and defence systems. Another concern is that the international image of the German army is at all time low, with its depleted workforce already seen as overly soft - particularly on recent peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan. Ms Von der Leyen has defended her recruitment project however, saying the army had to modernise its childcare policies in order to compete with top businesses and attract the best staff. Despite concerns over the strength of the German army, the country remains the world's third biggest arms exporter - behind only the U.S. and Russia. Foreign sales of weaponry bring almost €1billion into the German economy every year.","Defence minister said soldiers will not have to work during school holidays .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . The passport numbers of England's football squad have been published in an embarrassing security breach at the Sun Life Stadium. An hour before Roy Hodgson's squad kicked off their friendly against Ecuador in Miami, the team sheets were passed around the press box as usual. But at the same time, corporate sponsor Vauxhall tweeted the entire list, inadvertently publishing the personal information ahead of the game, which ended in a 2-2 draw.

In reference to ever-more-tenuous statistics being bandied around to justify optimisim for the Three Lions' chances, he pointed out: 'England have never lost a World Cup in which the players' passport numbers were on a pre tournament friendly team-sheet.

On average people in the North East, North West and Yorkshire have £14,635 a year to save or spend on themselves. This is more than £5,000 less than the £20,286 available to those living in the South East - or some £108.37 a week. Londoners have almost 30% more spare cash than the UK average . The stark north-south divide was revealed by the Office for National Statistics in its annual disposable cash figures. The ONS also released figures today revealing how record numbers of people are now working from home - with one in seven Brits doing their job away from the office. In 2012 Londoners had the most spare cash - with £21,446 available to save or spend. Northern Ireland had the lowest in the UK, with the average person only having £13,902. Those in the Home Counties around London sit second in the disposable cash league table - with £19,126 to spend every year. In England families in the North East are the worst off - with each person having just £14,393 to spend a year. The Yorkshire is second with £ 14,575 of spare cash per person. Those in the North West meanwhile have £14,939. Breaking the figures down even further, the difference between parts of the country is even starker. People in 'Inner London - West' - covering posh Kensington, Chelsea and Mayfar - have the most spare cash in the country with £36,963 available to save or spend. Nottingham meanwhile had the lowest, with the average person only having £11,411 for themselves. The £25,552 gap works out at more than £70 a day. People in west London have more than double the amount of disposable income than families in Nottingham . People in Northern Ireland are the worst off in the UK. The Scots and Welsh also have less spare cash than the English . Overall, the amount of spare cash Brits have in the pocket grew in every region of the country between 2011 and 2012. Despite being the poorest region, the North East had the strongest growth in disposable income - at four per cent, followed by Wales at 3.8 per cent. Northern Ireland had the weakest growth at 2.7 per cent. The average amount of disposable income across the country was £16,791 in 2012. Just four regions - London, the South East, the East of England and the South West - have more disposable cash than the UK average. The stark north-south divide in disposable income is clearly shown in this map - with the areas shaded dark purple having more spare cash than elsewhere . Meanwhile, separate figures released by the Office for National Statistics today reveal a record number of people are working from home after a huge increase over the past decade, new figures have shown. There were 4.2 million home workers in the first quarter of the year, around 14 per cent of those in work in Britain, ranging from childminding and care work to managers and senior company officials. This amounts to one in 17 Brits now working for home.","Londoners have more disposable income than anyone else in country .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Emergency powers are to be introduced to stamp out an invasion of killer Asian hornet. Ministers fear the impact on public health if swift action is not taken to deal with swarms of the deadly insects arriving on British shores. New species control orders will give the authorities power to wipeout animals, plants and pests which pose a threat to the health and security of the nation. New Species Control Orders will be used to stamp out foreign invaders, including the Asian Hornet which has killed six people in France . Fears have been growing about the imminent arrival of the killer hornets, which can eat up to 50 honey bees each a day. The come from China but have spread around the world and in France six people have died from anaphylactic shock after being stung. Beekeepers have been enlisted to keep watch for the arrival of the insects, but the government fears existing powers are too limited to deal with an invasion when it happens. The Infrastructure Bill, unveiled in today’s Queen’s Speech, includes details of a new battleplan to deal with invasive non-native species. It will introduce new controls for when landowners, homeowners or business are unable or unwilling to act to deal with the arrival of species which threaten the country. Special Control Orders will control ‘the invasive, non-native species that pose serious threats to biodiversity, the water environment and infrastructure’. Details of the new control orders were included in the Infrastructure Bill, announced by the Queen in the House of Lords . The Chinese term for hornets is 'hu feng'. Those behind the deadly attacks this summer appear to be the Asian giant hornet, or Vespa mandarinia. The Asian giant hornet grows up to 5cm long with a 6mm sting  which injects a large amount of potent venom. The hornet sting can be extremely painful to humans and has been compared to a hot nail being hammered into the body, . The head of the hornet is orange and quite wide in comparison to other hornet species. The . Asian giant hornet is intensely predatory; it hunts medium- to . large-sized insects, such as bees, other hornet species, and mantises. Hornets are most aggressive in behavior when they mate and migrate in September and October. Attacks are difficult to prevent because hornet nests are usually in hidden sites. The . orders will be available to deal with any new, dangerous species but . government sources suggested the Asian Hornet poses the greatest . imminent threat. It . will not apply to existing problem species, like Japanese Knotweed, but . act as a rapid response to deal with future threats before they take . hold. People who find the hornets are urged not to approach their nests but to contact the authorities. Exterminators . will be deployed to destroy their nests, normally found high in tees or . in buildings, with chemicals or by burning them. The . Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said 'most, if not . all' cases are dealt with voluntarily, but when speed is of the essence . the new powers would enable swift action to be taken. It . is thought the new control orders would be used once a year, in an . attempt to stop invasive species gaining a foothold in England. It follows a call from a committee of MPs for urgent action to better protect England from foreign invaders. The Environmental Audit Committee said: ‘There is a clear need for species control agreements and species control orders to ensure effectiveness of rapid response plans to eradicate invasive species before they can become established. ‘They could help avoid wasted effort and expenditure on large-scale control or eradication programmes, which might otherwise fail if access to all affected land could not be secured.’ It followed a warning from the Law Commission that the government should tighten the invasive species legislation for England and Wales as a top priority. The government said that the Infrastructure Bill would also clear the way for new roads, exploration of fracking and freeing up public land for homes. The changes will see the Highways Agency (HA) transformed into a Government-owned company. The Government reckons the move, covering England's motorways and major A-roads, will save taxpayers at least £2.6 billion over the next 10 years. However the Government is risking the ire of environmental campaigners and its own supporters with changes to laws to make it easier to frack under people's homes.","New species control orders will enable rapid response to natural threats .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Government plans to allow voters to sack their MPs were today dismissed as 'worse than meaningless'. The long-awaited bill to allow MPs to be 'recalled' by constituents was announced in the Queen's Speech. It will give constituents the opportunity to sign a petition demanding a by-election if an MP is jailed - or if the House of Commons 'resolves that an MP should face a recall petition'. Deputy Prime Minister, walking with Labour's shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman in Parliament today, has watered down proposals to give voters the power to sack MPs . But the proposals were slammed by Tory backbencher Zac Goldsmith, who said MPs should not have a role in deciding whether or not they should face a petition to be sacked. He said: 'Recall is about empowering people to hold their MPs to account at all times, that's all it is. 'It's a very simple mechanism that happens all over the world. What this bill will do is that it gives that power to a committee of parliamentarians, of MPs - the same committee, by the way, that got into trouble over Maria Miller.' Mr Goldsmith warned that the measures would leave voters with 'no more power after this bill goes through than they do today', and predicted an 'immense' backlash. He added: 'It's worse than meaningless, it's a pretense, and voters will know it's a pretense at the very first scandal.' He insisted he was still 'pleased' that there will be a recall bill going through Parliament. Tory MP Zac Goldsmith has led a campaign to introduce the power of recall. He wants voters to be given the power to spark a by-election if they want to get rid of their member of Parliament . But he added: 'The criteria are so narrow that it's virtually meaningless, it would be impossible to recall anyone. 'So the danger of this - and it really is a danger, particularly on the back of this huge Ukip vote we saw last week - is that people will discover at the very first scandal that they have been duped, that they have no more power after this bill goes through than they do today, and I think the backlash will be immense. Former Labour MP Denis MacShane was jailed for six months last year after he was caught fiddling his expenses by more than £12,000 . 'It's worse than meaningless, it's a pretense, and voters will know it's a pretense at the very first scandal... that's the politest word I can possibly think of, it's a pretense, that's what it is.' The Taxpayers’ Alliance meanwhile said it was an 'embarrassingly weak' proposal. The group's chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: ""This stitch-up will do nothing to restore the trust of voters in politics. It will centralise more power in Westminster, rather than handing it to voters.' Alexandra Runswick, Director of Unlock Democracy, added: 'These recall proposals are symbolic of the government’s attitude to democratic reform. 'They say they want to give power back to the people but never quite manage to manage to follow through. The power to recall an elected representative between elections is an essential mechanism for democratic accountability. 'Recall enjoyed cross-party support and featured in every party manifesto. Why are the government afraid of giving voters their say? 'Genuine recall empowers voters not parliamentary committees. At the moment when there is a scandal political parties can have a say, they can withdraw the whip from the MP, Parliament can have a say through the Standards Committee but voters are left out in the cold. 'The government’s watered down version of recall risks creating the illusion that people will have a say in recalling their elected representative while ensuring that this will probably never happen in practice. There is a real danger that this could alienate people from politics and politicians even further.'","Watered-down 'right to recall' included in the Queen's speech today .

"By . Jeannette Kupfermann . Nursing both a badly broken arm and a fractured leg, you would think I could reasonably  expect a little sympathy — especially in a  doctor’s surgery. What I got was the opposite. Arriving at my GP practice for a check-up, I found that the cast on my arm plus the orthopaedic boot I was wearing made it difficult to use the touch-screen system to announce my arrival — so I queued to ask the receptionist if she would check me in at her computer instead. But rather than taking a few seconds to help me out, with a look of triumph in her eyes she sneered: ‘Why don’t you use your other hand?’ and sent me hobbling back to the screen. Left shaken: Jeannette Kupfermann was shocked by the callous treatment she received from her GP's receptionist . I was fairly shaken, but didn’t argue because so many GP’s receptionists appear to have diplomas in sour-faced indifference. The callous, supercilious, rude and apathetic attitude of many of them must surely top most people’s list of complaints against the NHS. When we are sick, vulnerable and anxious, the surgery is our first point of contact. Yet all too often the waiting-room staff are less guardian angels than dragons at the gate. I’ve heard complaint after complaint about the bad attitudes encountered by my friends and family. Many have spoken of their frustration at being fobbed off and even lied to. Many, like me, felt dehumanised and humiliated. None are surprised to read stories of people treated appallingly by their GP’s admin staff, such as the woman last month who was forced to wait outside by a busy road after a doctor’s receptionist said her sick 16-month-old baby was crying too loudly. Rarely, if ever, are these people challenged, as they hold us over a barrel. While I accept there are plenty of good, hard-working doctors’ receptionists out there who strive to help patients, I also know there are many who can be real battleaxes. An offended receptionist equals no appointment. But after my own upsetting experience, I told my doctor what had happened. He seemed at a loss to explain and apologised. I later wrote a strong letter to the practice manager, who told me that not all staff had received their full training yet, as if that were any excuse. But as we all know, this kind of attitude tends to be the rule — and for the elderly, in particular, it can be a nightmare. It often starts with a phone call you’ve been poised to make since dawn, as having your finger on the redial button the moment surgery phone lines open is your only chance of getting through. Each month, 23 million people (more than three times the population of London) visit their GP surgery or practice nurse . My friend Peggy, a 92-year-old widow from Kent who suffers from several painful illnesses that need continual monitoring, recently had a shocking experience. ‘I was ringing to get some blood test results,’ she told me.  ‘It was difficult getting through, but eventually I spoke to a receptionist and told her I’d been asked to make an appointment to see or speak to the doctor about them. ‘She told me  to hang on  a moment while she spoke to the doctor. I waited and waited. A good 15 minutes passed before I had  to hang up. ‘An hour later I rang again, and when I got the same woman I asked her why she’d left me hanging on the phone. She replied rudely: “Because I had nothing to tell you.” ’ Eventually, Peggy rang again and was put through to another receptionist who also put her on hold. Dragons: Like Ros from Monsters Inc. many waiting room staff leave patients feeling humiliated and dehumanised . ‘She promised me faithfully she’d call back,’ says Peggy. ‘But again I waited and waited. It’s been days now and I haven’t heard a thing.’ To me, this illustrates perfectly all that is going wrong at reception — especially with the elderly, who get anxious about problems but are brushed off like irritating flies. No wonder they are so disheartened and either give up — putting their health at risk — or go to A&E. And every busy working mother will identify with the frustration of Berkshire woman Elizabeth Harris.‘I’d managed to get an appointment about getting some acne lotion for my 14-year-old daughter,’ says Elizabeth, who is in her 40s. ‘I saw the doctor, got the prescription and went next door to the pharmacy, where I was told that the lotion wasn’t available  any more. ‘I rushed back into the surgery — I was already late for work and had to fit in another appointment — but by then there was a  long queue. ‘I explained what had happened to the receptionist and asked if there was any chance she could ask the doctor if she could write me another prescription. ‘She just said: “No, I can’t. You’ll have to ring in the morning to see the doctor again.” I pointed out that the next day was Saturday, when they took only emergencies, but I might as well have been talking to a brick wall.’ It’s no surprise that figures released in 2012 showed that complaints to family doctors were running at 1,000 a week, with a rise in grievances about surly receptionists. Complaints: Many others share Jeannette's frustrations . So what has gone wrong? ‘The NHS sometimes forgets that it’s a service provider and should put the patient first,’ says one senior nurse. ‘There are too many people trying to get into too few surgeries, and doctors condone their receptionists’ behaviour  because it keeps the patients at bay. ‘It reflects the state of everything else in the NHS — but that doesn’t excuse their terrible manner.’Heather Adlam, a business trainer who runs workshops for GP receptionists to help them improve their communication skills, agrees. ‘We think we’re getting something free and don’t have the right to expect too much,’ she says. ‘But it’s not “free”. ‘It’s part of the insurance we took out with the Government — we’ve all paid an awful lot into it.’ As for me, I believe the situation simply reflects how impersonal GP surgeries have become. Providing forms to fill out, stating your level of satisfaction with all stages of a GP visit, might help.This way, patients could remain anonymous. After all, none of us wants to deal with confrontation and risk not getting an appointment. But until we do so — in a civilised way — and end the intimidation, this callousness will continue.","Nursing broken bones, Jeanette was shocked by callous GP receptionist .

"By . Martin Robinson . Tesco's boss admitted today its quarterly results are the worst for 40 years as it emerged a million shoppers a week may be abandoning them for rivals. Britain's biggest grocer says like-for-like sales fell more than 3.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 – far worse than the 2.9 per cent drop in the previous three months. Chief executive Philip Clarke, whose job may be under threat, unveiled the deepening sales decline today and said they are the worst he had seen in four decades at the supermarket. Supermarket crisis: Tesco, Britain's biggest grocer, has posted a 3.7% drop in like-for-like sales for the last quarter - considered the worst figures for 40 years by its boss . Mr Clarke refused to be drawn on when sales would start to increase again but declared 'I'm not going anywhere'. He added: 'There hasn't been a quarter of like-for-like sales like this before that I can remember, but I've never seen a period of such intense transformation for the industry.' It is also the third quarter in a row . that sales have plummeted and the bad news has sent shares downwards this morning. HSBC . market analyst David McCarthy said: 'Tesco looks like it is . experiencing more than one million fewer customer visits per week on a . like-for-like basis. We assume average expenditure of £25 per lost . visit'. Today's results heap more pressure on Tesco . boss Phil Clarke, amid reports his successors are already . being lined up. Despite spending £200million on cutting . the price of basic items, analysts say Tesco is still perceived as ‘too . expensive’ compared to the likes of Aldi and Lidl. But revealing the results, Mr Clarke, maintained there are positive signs for the supermarket. He said: 'Our accelerated plans are making a real difference for customers and we are more competitive than we have been for many years.' But he warned that the programme was continuing to disrupt like-for-like sales performance. Mr Clarke added: 'We are pleased by the early response to our accelerated efforts to deliver the most compelling offer for customers. 'We expect this acceleration to continue to impact our headline performance throughout the coming quarters and for trading conditions to remain challenging for the UK grocery market as a whole.' Investors are understood to have . begun discussing his potential replacements, with former Dixons boss John . Browett linked to the post. Tesco’s woes have stunned the industry . with one expert saying such a poor performance would have been ‘almost . unfathomable in times past’. Clive Back, an analyst at stockbrokers Shore Capital, said he had ‘never been so gloomy about Tesco’s prospects in 20 years’. He . said: ‘We believe Tesco UK is increasingly perceived by customers as . simply too expensive versus the discounters, Asda and potentially . Morrisons. That is a dangerous and frankly untenable place for a . mass-market leader to be.’ Picture of Britain: Tesco is still the UK's biggest supermarket but its market share has shrunk as Waitrose, Aldi and Lidl took shoppers from the 'Big Four' Tesco is still by far the biggest UK supermarket with 28.6 per of market share, but this is down from 29.7 per cent a year ago. Asda had 17.4 per cent, Sainsbury's had 16.5 per cent and Morrisons had 11.1 per cent in the year ending March 30. But . all have faced a surge from competitors gobbling up customers, with . Aldi's share of the market up from 3.4 per cent to 4.6 per cent in the . past 12 months. Waitrose . had five per cent compared with 4.8 per cent last year, and Lidl also . experienced strong growth in a record-breaking month and now accounts . for 3.4 per cent of the market. As well as cutting prices, Tesco has recruited more staff and spruced up its stores in a bid to revive its fortunes. Big shoes to fill: The grim figures will pile further pressure on chief executive Phil Clarke, who has struggled since he took over from Sir Terry Leahy in 2011 . The . Big Four supermarkets – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – have . all suffered at the hands of the discounters as well as premium range . rivals Waitrose and Whole Foods. The . popularity of Aldi and Lidl has increased significantly since the start . of the recession with the stigma felt by some at being seen in one of . their stores wearing off. Industry . experts say that shopping habits have changed, with the weekly shop . giving way to more frequent smaller trips as families hunt out the best . deals and reduce waste. The pressure on Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke, right, has intensified following another big drop in like-for-like sales. Here is a timeline of the company's performance since he took the helm in 2011. February 2011 . Sir Terry Leahy steps down as chief executive on his 55th birthday after 14 years in charge, overseeing a leap in pre-tax profits from £750 million in 1997 to £3.4 billion at the group's last set of annual figures in April 2010. His record includes the launch of Tesco.com and premium range Tesco Finest and its expansion into America with the Fresh & Easy chain. The market share of the group stands at 30.5%. January 2012 . Less than a year into Mr Clarke's tenure, Tesco shocks the market with its first profit warning in almost 20 years after poor Christmas trading. Shares plunge by as much as 15%, or more than £4 billion. Tesco, in common with the country's three other leading grocers - Wal-Mart's Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - finds itself squeezed by discounters Aldi and Lidl and upmarket grocers Waitrose and Marks & Spencer. April 2012 . The chain unveils a £1billion UK revival plan, which includes upgrading stores, the recruitment of more staff and better prices and value. The initiative follows complaints that its 2,800 stores are cold and industrial with poor levels of service. April 2013 . Tesco reports its first fall in annual profits in 19 years, with post-tax profit tumbling almost 96 per cent to £120million from a year earlier. The figure is hit by a £1.2billion charge on the retailer's US Fresh & Easy chain of around 200 stores as it confirms it will leave the country. The firm also suffers a £804million write-down in the UK on land for more than 100 major stores, bought at the height of the property boom, which will no longer be developed. February . The supermarket promises to spend an additional £200million on lower prices for basic products, such as carrots, tomatoes, onions, peppers and cucumbers. It will also rein in annual capital spending to no more than £2.5billion for at least the next three years as a result of the dramatic reduction in store expansion - nearly half the £4.7billion spent in 2008/09. April . Mr Clarke brushes off speculation about his future despite little sign that his £1 billion plan to turn around the retail juggernaut is bearing fruit. Profits fall 6.9% to £3.05 billion for the year to February 22 while fourth-quarter like-for-like sales slumped by 3% as its UK market share falls to 28.6 per cent in the 12 weeks to March 31, from 29.7 per cent in the same period a year earlier. June . Till-roll figures from Kantar Worldpanel show a decline in Tesco's market share to 29 per cent in the 12 weeks to May 25, compared with 30.5 per cent a year earlier. A day later, the chain reports a 3.7 per cent fall in like-for-like sales for the first quarter of its financial year.","Britain's biggest retailer faces crisis as like-for-like sales down again .

"By . John Hall . A debut novelist whose work was rejected by publishers for a decade has won one of the world's top literary awards. Irish author Eimear McBride, 37, beat heavyweights including American Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Donna Tartt to win the £30,000 Women's Prize for Fiction at a ceremony in central London. Her novel 'A Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing' was written 10 years ago but was rejected as too experimental by every publisher who read it, until a small company in McBride's hometown of Norwich finally agreed to release it last year. Recognition: 'A Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing' by Eimear McBride (pictured) was rejected by publishers for 10 years. Yesterday the novel won the £30,000 Women's Prize for Fiction at a ceremony in central London . The novel, which is the story of a young woman's relationship with her brother and the long shadow cast by his childhood brain tumour, was written in just six months in 2004. After being rejected by every publisher she sent it to, McBride decided to put the novel away until last year when Norwich-based independent publisher Gallery Beggar Press agreed it must be published. The company paid McBride a £600 advance for what was only the second book it had ever released, with 'A Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing' later picked up by Faber & Faber, who gave it a wider audience. The book has been critically acclaimed since its release, winning the inaugural Goldsmiths Prize last year and narrowly losing out on the The Folio Prize in March to American writer George Saunders. Speaking yesterday, Helen Fraser, who chaired the Women's Prize for Fiction judging panel, said: 'An amazing and ambitious first novel that . impressed the judges with its inventiveness and energy. This is an . extraordinary new voice - this novel will move and astonish the reader.' Stiff competition: Eimear McBride beat a number of acclaimed authors, including previous winner Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (left) and American Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Donna Tartt (right) Ms McBride, who was born in Liverpool but grew up Sligo and Mayo in Ireland, collected her prize at an awards ceremony at the Royal Festival Hall in London. She beat a number of acclaimed authors including a previous winner, Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who was nominated for 'Americanah'. Jonathan Ruppin, web editor for Foyles bookshop, said: 'To paraphrase Brian Eno's legendary quote about the first Velvet Underground album, not many people have bought it so far but every single one of them will probably write a novel.' 'It's bold, brilliant and beautiful, a book that will delight every reader concerned that the novel had nowhere new to go and reinforce every prejudice of those who dismiss literary fiction as pretentious.' Previous winners of the prize, formerly sponsored by communications company Orange, include Zadie Smith's On Beauty and Lionel Shriver's We Need to Talk About Kevin.","Irish author Eimear McBride won the £30,000 Women's Prize for Fiction .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A judge has criticised a ‘lamentable failure’ by senior police officers to prevent a man raping a teenage girl and forcing her to have sex with his friends. The case came to court at a time when similar crimes were under the spotlight. Detectives from Thames Valley Police were told a 14-year-old schoolgirl was abused by Omid Ali, 21, but the judge said the predator was able to abuse her again because of a lack of action. Criticism: Judge Gordon Risius (left) slammed Thames Valley Police for failing to prevent Omid Ali (right) repeatedly abusing a 14-year-old girl . The crimes happened after the force launched Operation Bullfinch in May 2011, which targeted men sexually abusing vulnerable young girls in council care and saw seven men jailed for a total of 95 years after an 18-week trial at the Old Bailey last year. At Oxford Crown Court, Judge Gordon Risius told how Ali, who was jailed for 14 years, subjected a vulnerable teenage girl to repeated abuse and forced her to have sex with his friends. Judge Risius said the crimes were reported to police in January 2012 but officers did ‘little or nothing’ to follow them up and that Ali went on to abuse his victim again in the summer of 2012 before being arrested in November 2013. Thames Valley Police Chief Constable Sara Thornton said the failures were unacceptable and that an internal investigation was underway to determine what went wrong. Sentencing Ali, Judge Risius said the girl reported the abuse to a teacher at her school, who notified the police and Oxfordshire County Council. Sentenced: Omid Ali was given a 14-year jail term at Oxford Crown Court . ‘The police also spoke to her parents, who were unaware of what had been going on,’ said Judge Risius. ‘The police promised to deal with the matter and to keep them informed. ‘However, the officers tasked with carrying out the investigation did little or nothing to follow it up, despite a review by a more senior officer six months later.’ ‘The jury were told that the police professional standards department is now looking into this lamentable failure to investigate very serious allegations with the care and attention they warranted. ‘Whether or not you realised that the police were taking no action, it had undoubted consequences for the girl, because during the school summer holidays in 2012 you asked her to get in touch with you.’ On that occasion Ali threatened the girl into having sex with two of his friends, who have not yet been tried, and then told her to leave quickly afterwards. Ali, of Headington, Oxfordshire, was convicted of rape, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and sexual activity with a child. The judge’s comments sparked criticism from Labour MP for Oxford East Andrew Smith, who said they sounded a ‘very serious warning note.’ ‘Especially after the experience of Operation Bullfinch, it is alarming and surprising that police did not follow up on this, with the wholly unacceptable consequences the judge referred to,’ said Mr Smith. ‘The public will want to know exactly what went wrong and what has been done to put it right. ‘People need to have confidence that the police are doing all they can to the highest standards of professionalism and effectiveness.’ Chief Constable Thornton said the investigation was being looked at by the professional standards department and supervised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. ‘The initial handling of this case was completely unacceptable,’ she said. ‘As soon as the deficiencies came to light the force moved quickly to rectify the situation, working closely with the victim and her family and arresting Omid Ali for his offences. ‘As a result, he has been handed a significant sentence of 14 years in prison.’ Oxfordshire County Council spokesman Paul Smith said: ‘Oxfordshire County Council takes grooming and sexual exploitation of children very seriously and encourages anyone with concerns to contact the specialist Kingfisher unit. ‘We will always listen to children.’","Thames Valley Police was told about the abuse of a schoolgirl, 14, in 2012 .

"By . Kate Lyons . The U.S. Justice Department has filed papers accusing Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, as being the leader of the gang behind the software . The dangerous cyber pandemic known as Gameover Zeus could have infected thousands of British computers and be lying dormant gathering data, experts say. The malware, which the FBI estimates has hit between 500,000 and one million computers worldwide, has resulted in users losing tens of millions of dollars. Gameover Zeus, which experts say is 'sophisticated' and capable of evading anti-virus software, infects a user's machine when they open a PDF or click on a link sent to them in an email. Once it is set up on the computer, Gameover Zeus will intercept all financial transactions and rewrite them, so that payments made by the user will be redirected into other accounts. The malware also has the power to disguise unapproved payments that are made, meaning that thefts might have occurred even if accounts appear normal. The virus has hit computer users around the world, with the most incidents reported in the U.S. and Italy – 13 percent and 12 percent respectively. Seven percent of incidents have occurred in the UK. 'It keeps track of balances; it . automatically corrects the numbers on the balance. It's so sophisticated . that it hides its tacks,' said Nick Savvides, senior principal systems . engineer at Symantec in Australia. Mr Savvides stated that many computer users could have downloaded the virus already and it may be lying dormant on their machines ready to be activated at any moment. Scroll down for video . The Gameover Zeus malware has targeted computers in the U.S. with up to one million affected worldwide . Cryptolocker is malware run by the same gang behind Gameover Zeus and they are often installed on computers at the same time. The Cryptolocker malware often comes into effect if the user is not a 'viable' victim for Gameover Zeus and the network cannot access their financial details. Cryptolocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked. 'There's really no alternative to getting files back after the infection [except paying the ransom],' said Marcel Mascunan, Marketing Manager for Kroll Ontrack Asia-Pacific. 'It’s a really nasty piece of malware.' The U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay this ransom to release sensitive files. The Gameover Zeus malware was shut down by an international police effort this week, spearheaded by the FBI, assisted by both the Australian Federal Police and Symantec. This is the third attempt to shut down the malware, which first emerged in 2011, and the FBI is reporting that users have two weeks to clean up their hard drives and install anti-virus software before the network responsible for Gameover Zeus will be operational again. Gameover Zeus has been so difficult to shut down because it uses peer-to-peer software, meaning that even if the main server is shut down, infected computers can continue to communicate with one another and continue operating. Another reason is that once installed on a computer, Gameover Zeus has the ability to evade anti-virus software. 'Once it has infected [a computer], it's very hard to get it off,' said Mr Savvides. Computers are often concurrently infected with Gameover Zeus and a separate piece of malware, Cryptolocker, and there is some evidence linking the two pieces of malware back to the same Eastern European network. The Cryptolocker malware often comes into effect if the user is not a 'viable' victim for Gameover Zeus and the network cannot access their financial details. Cryptolocker then locks the information on the computer and holds it to ransom. At the moment the software demands one Bitcoin, an untraceable form of online currency favoured by criminals, which is around £300. In the worst cases, victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained . According to Symantec data, three percent of people affected by the Cryptolocker malware pay the ransom rather than lose their files and paying the ransom seems to be the only way for users to gain access to their files once they have been attacked. 'There's really no alternative to getting files back after the infection. There's not much we can do about it… without having the keys it's virtually impossible to decrypt the files,' said Marcel Mascunan, Marketing Manager for Kroll Ontrack Asia-Pacific. The U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay this ransom to release sensitive files. Earlier this week, the U.S. Justice Department filed papers accusing a Russian named Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev as being the leader of the gang behind the software. Could Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, be the behind the global cyber virus pandemic? He is the man suspected of being behind a gang that has sparked a global cyber virus pandemic. But the FBI has already spent years looking for Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev who uses the online names ‘lucky12345’ and ‘slavik’. The 31-year-old is already wanted for his alleged involvement in a ‘racketeering enterprise’ that installed malicious software known as ‘Zeus’ on victims’ computers. The software was used to capture bank account numbers, passwords, personal identification numbers, and other information needed to log into online banking accounts. The FBI believes Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator while others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails, which contained links to compromised websites. Victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware, which Bogachev and others allegedly used to steal money from the victims’ bank accounts. This online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the FBI since the summer of 2009. Starting in September 2011, the FBI began investigating a modified version of the Zeus Trojan, known as Gameover Zeus (GOZ). It is believed GOZ is responsible for more than one million computer infections, resulting in financial losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. On August 22, 2012, Bogachev was indicted under the nickname ‘lucky12345’ by a federal grand jury in the District of Nebraska on a number of charges including Bank Fraud, Conspiracy to Violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Aggravated Identity Theft. On May 19, 2014, Bogachev was indicted in his true name by a federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania on charges of Conspiracy, Computer Fraud, Wire Fraud, Bank Fraud and Money Laundering. Then just days ago on May 30, a criminal complaint was issued in the District of Nebraska that ties the previously indicted nickname of ‘lucky12345’ to Bogachev and charges him with Conspiracy to Commit Bank Fraud. He is described as white with brown hair (though his head is usually shaved) and brown eyes. He is 5ft 9ins tall and weighs around 180 pounds (82kg). Bogachev was last known to live in Anapa, Russia. He is believed to enjoy boating and may travel to locations along the Black Sea in his boat. He also owns property in Krasnodar, Russia. The complaint claims the software has . been responsible for the loss of more than $100m from individuals and a . string of major companies, with estimates that members of the gang . behind the malware would have amassed tens of millions of dollars each. Computer users who fear they could fall victim to the virus are advised to install anti-virus software and ensure their operating system has the latest security updates. Users are also advised to change their passwords, as original passwords may have been compromised during infection, and to enable automatic updates on their anti-virus software. Users are also advised being cautious when handling unsolicited or unexpected emails, particularly during the two-week window before hackers rebuild their network. The boss of a Government-backed website aimed at helping victims of cyber-crime has apologised after it temporarily stopped functioning as the Gameover Zeus crisis unfolded. Computer users had been urged to contact Get Safe Online if they had concerns about the malware. But within minutes of that announcement on Monday, the website suffered an outage amid 'unprecedented demand' for the service with problems running into Wednesday. Chief executive Tony Neate has since apologised and claimed that the website had 'quadrupled' its capacity. It appeared to be up and running on Wednesday afternoon. He added that the site itself had not been the subject of a cyber attack and that demand itself had caused the problems. Get Safe Online is a jointly-funded initiative between several Government departments and private sector businesses and describes itself as the Government’s preferred online security advice channel. Experts have also warned users to back-up all valuable data. Many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers. Symantec has also produced a clean-up tool for infected users who need to get rid of the malware. However potential victims only have only a short time to protect themselves before the hackers can rebuild their network.","Up to one million computers have been infected by 'Gameover Zeus'

"By . Ted Thornhill . A carer was caught red-handed stealing money from an 88-year-old disabled widow’s purse by a hidden camera in a mantelpiece clock. Carol Oldfield, 46, was filmed taking £10 from the purse of frail Molly Roberts, then turning around and saying ‘I won’t see you next week - I’m on holiday’. Oldfield, from Chorley, Lancashire, was found guilty of breach of trust and was told to repay the £10 she stole by Preston Crown Court. She was also ordered to pay £200 in costs. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Caught red-handed: Carol Oldfield was filmed stealing £10 from the purse of an elderly amputee in Lancashire . Judgement: Oldfield, from Chorley, Lancashire, was told to repay the £10 she stole by Preston Crown Court . Shaken: Gwen Bode (right) said that Oldfield has shattered her faith in human nature and that her mother (left) is totally shaken and feels she can't trust anybody following the theft . The court heard she now intends to set up her own care company, despite pleading guilty and being given a 12-week jail term suspended for two years. The court heard that Mrs Roberts’ daughter, Gwen Bode, regularly withdrew money for her mother, who is confined to a wheelchair after having her leg amputated. She became suspicious when the cash started to quickly run out and got her husband to fit the spy camera. Less than an hour later thieving Carol Oldfield arrived on a regular care visit - and immediately took £10 from Mrs Roberts’ purse when her back was turned. Gwen, 59, a retired teacher, told the care company within hours of seeing the footage and police were alerted. Oldfield, 46, was immediately suspended by the firm she worked for, Lancashire-based Crossroads Care. Oldfield, who had worked for the company for 20 years, initially denied theft and claimed Mrs Roberts had given her the cash for some moisturising cream, but she eventually confessed. She was branded as greedy and opportunistic by the judge. Secret filming: Oldfield was caught by a camera hidden inside a fake clock radio . Gwen said: ‘I just can’t believe someone would do this to my mum. She’s a lovely lady and has been through so much. ‘She even says if Carol had needed the money so much, which she didn’t, she would have lent her it if only she asked. ‘She has shattered my faith in human nature and now we lock all the doors all the time. My mum is totally shaken and feels she can’t trust anybody. ‘I can’t believe she wants to set up her own business. She shouldn’t be caring for anyone’.","Carol Oldfield, 46, filmed taking £10 from the purse of frail Molly Roberts .

"By . Tara Brady . Ralph Smith was given £150,000 by a Malaysian woman he met on a dating website who turned out to be a suspected terrorist . A pensioner was given £150,000 by a Malaysian woman he met on a dating website who turned out to be a suspected terrorist laundering money, a court heard. Ralph Smith, 61, of Biscovey, Cornwall, signed up for the over-50s site after splitting with his wife and soon became besotted with mother-of-two Lilian Alves. During the next few months the pair expressed their 'undying love' for one another before Alves asked Mr Smith for his bank details. But unlike typical internet dating scams where victims find their savings raided, Mr Smith was amazed to find an extra £150,000 sitting in his account. Alves, claiming to be an affluent businesswoman in her early 60s, told disabled Mr Smith she needed her money in the UK so she could pay her European employees. Mr Smith agreed to wire the money on to a series of individuals but his bank refused to transfer the funds. The cyber romance came to an abrupt halt last September when Alves broke off contact ahead of a promised visit to the UK. Instead, Mr Smith was arrested by detectives who showed up at his home investigating the theft of £600,000 from a bank account in Guernsey. Detectives said the money was stolen by hackers who wired it to Asia then sent a chunk to Mr Smith's account. He was suspected of acting as a 'money mule' for the gang who would likely use the cash to fundorganised crime or terrorism. But when shocked Mr Smith, appeared at Truro Crown Court the prosecution offered no evidence because they accepted he was an innocent victim. The court heard whoever was pretending to be Alves had picked identical interests to lure him in before exchanging emails for months. Prosecutor Elaine Hobson said a charge of converting £150,000 of criminal property between August 28 and September 1, 2013 had been dropped. He said: 'He has been duped - that is the view the Crown takes.' Mr Smith appeared at Truro Crown Court where the prosecution offered no evidence because they accepted he was an innocent victim . Entering a formal verdict of not guilty on Ralph’s behalf, Judge Christopher Harvey Clark QC said: . 'The prosecution took the very reasonable view that enough is enough. 'You leave the dock an innocent man, no doubt a wiser man.' Devon and Cornwall Police have not been able to unmask Alves or establish exactly what was planned with the funds, £500,000 of which are still missing. But Detective Constable Martin Skinner of the force’s Financial Investigation Unit said the complex scam showed how innocent singletons like Ralph can fall prey to cyber conmen. Ralph Smith signed up for the site after splitting with his wife and soon became besotted with Lilian Alves . He said: 'Alves had basically expressed her undying love for him to gain his trust. 'She then concocted a story suggesting that she wanted to come over and visit Mr Smith but she had to pay some employees who were working in Europe who would only trust a UK bank account. 'Mr Smith was subsequently charged with criminal offences due to not reporting the incident to police immediately. 'You leave the dock an innocent man, no doubt a wiser man' Judge Christopher Harvey Clark QC . Det Con Skinner said the gang set up their profile specifically to seduce Mr Smith. He added: 'They basically did the work of the dating agency. They set up a profile for the exact sort of woman who would match Mr Smith’s requirements. 'Alves appeared affluent, well presented, she had photos taken abroad in the U.S. and Canada. She even had supposed links to Biscovey. 'It was very convincing but in reality all a load of rubbish. 'This can happen to anyone. It’s a message we need to get across to the public - don’t trust anyone when there are finances involved; always double-check; never give your bank details out.' Mr Smith, who can no longer work because of his disability, has since got back together with his wife. He has never been in trouble with the police before and says he had no idea the woman he fell in love with was a fraudster. Mr Smith said: 'I had absolutely no idea, never even gave it a thought that it was a crime. I was unaware of crime going on like that. 'My warning is to other people to please go careful online, who they talk to and who they trust because it happened to me and it happened so easily. 'I would just like it not to happen to somebody else, to have to go through what I’ve been through.'","Ralph Smith, 61, of Biscovey, Cornwall, signed up for the over-50s site .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Flour power: Funeral director Julian Riley threw a bag of flour over his neighbour's Mercedes in a row over parking, but it set like concrete . An undertaker threw a bag of flour over his neighbour’s Mercedes in a parking row outside his funeral parlour, only for it to set as hard as concrete and cause £7,000 of damage. A court heard that funeral director Julian Riley, 39, emptied the 2lb bag of self-raising flour over Peter Elliot's black E-320 because it was blocking access for his hearse. He admitted throwing the flour, not expecting it to have caused any damage, but when Mr Elliot, 60, took the car to a specialist garage they found it had dried on the paintwork like 'brittle cement' and told him it would cost £7,397 to repair. 'It was crystalised powder, like brittle concrete, it had gone hard,' mechanic Lee Kedward, who examined the damaged car, told Newport Magistrates' Court. 'The main impact area was the bonnet and windscreen but the residue had gone all the way over the vehicle. 'There . was little bits of the powder crystalised all over it, there was damage . to the boot and a lot of powder around the heating ducts and filtration . system. 'We tried to use hot soapy water but there were large pieces where you had to use your nail to scrape it off. 'You couldn’t get it all off without scratching the paint.' Riley fell out with Mr Elliot after he bought a house opposite him in the village of Clydach, near Abergavenny, South Wales. Newport magistrates heard the pair had argued over parking for weeks before the flour attack in September last year. 'Mr Elliot found his black Mercedes had been covered in white powder,' said prosecutor Andrew Kendall. 'A trail of white powder led from the vehicle across the road to the defendant’s property.' Riley was arrested and admitted damaging the Mercedes-Benz E-320. He told officers: 'Unfortunately I was very annoyed and took the law into my hands and threw a packet of self-raising flour over his car. Rock solid: A mechanic told the court that the flour had turned into 'brittle concrete', and could not be removed without scratching the paintwork costing £7,000 to fix . Victim: Riley fell out with Peter Elliot, 60, (pictured) after he bought a house opposite him in the village of Clydach, near Abergavenny, South Wales . 'It was more or less the whole packet.' Riley pleaded guilty to criminal damage but contested the cost of the damage to the Mercedes. He went to a second specialist who estimated the damage to the car was around £400. District Judge Richard Williams said described it as a 'spiteful and vengeful offence', but adjourned sentence until next month. After the hearing Mr Elliot said: 'It’s unbelievable, I’ve never known anyone act like he has. 'There’s only one loser here and that’s me. I can’t understand why I should have to pay for this damage.'","Julian Riley emptied 2lb flour bag over Peter Elliot's black E-320 Mercedes .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Giorgio Orsoni, 67, is reported to be under house arrested charged with funding foreign political parties . The mayor of Venice is among 35 people arrested after a multi-billion pound project to stop the city from flooding was hit by an anti-corruption probe. Mayor Giorgio Orsoni, 67, is under house arrest, accused of illegally financing political parties. Authorities say 20million euros (£16million) was diverted to overseas bank accounts and used to fund foreign parties. According to the BBC, the corruption took place during the tender process to build the so-called Moses barriers. The £4billion Moses project involves building more than a mile of barriers to seal off Venice lagoon in the event of high tides or flooding. The project was first put forward in 1966 but the barriers only started being built 11 years ago, and the first was installed last year after delays and financial problems during Italy's economic crash. Italian financial police confirmed that Giorgio Orsoni had been arrested and the ANSA news agency said he was being investigated for alleged corruption, extortion and money laundering. Prosecutors Luigi Delpino and Carlo Nordio said: 'The investigation shows that a great portion of the funds was used to finance political forces at the city, regional and national level, and corrupt high-level public officials.' A spokeswoman for the Venice city government had no immediate comment, and centre-left mayor Giorgio Orsoni's spokesman did not respond to phone calls. The arrests were the result of a . three-year investigation that led to the arrest last summer of the head . of the consortium building the ambitious but long-delayed system of . so-called Moses barriers. It is the latest in a series of Italian bribery investigations involving high-profile public works projects. A series of unrelated corruption . investigations, mostly involving bribery or embezzlement accusations, . have implicated former high-ranking government ministers in recent . months. The £4billion Moses project involves around a mile of barriers being built to seal off three entrances to the lagoon in the event of high tides and flooding . Investigations have revolved around some of the biggest Italian public works projects including the Milan world's fair, Expo 2015, and an Italian-funded water project in Iraq. Most recently, a former interior minister was accused of helping a businessman flee Italy to escape a Mafia association sentence. The string of arrests has prompted comparisons to the Clean Hands anti-corruption investigations of the 1990s that toppled an entire political class. The one clear difference this time is that the alleged bribery involves individuals from across the political spectrum rather than political parties enriching themselves. The latest arrests put more pressure on Premier Matteo Renzi to take action, after his appointment of an anti-corruption czar earlier this year. Over the weekend, the European Commission flagged the deep-rooted problem of corruption as an issue hampering investment and economic renewal in Italy, which ranked 69th in Transparency International's perceived level of public sector corruption last year - behind Montenegro and just ahead of Kuwait.","Giogio Orsoni, 67, among 35 people arrested over allegations of corruption .

Tuesday May 27: Gareth Huntley, 34, from London, goes on a trek to visit a waterfall in Tioman Island, off the south eastern coast of Malaysia's mainland. He leaves in the morning and tells friends at the headquarters of a nearby charity project where he is volunteering that he will return by 2pm the same day. He fails to come back so a group goes out to search for him, checking various routes to the waterfall which is 6km away. Wednesday May 28: A further search also proves fruitless. According to fellow volunteer Charles Fisher the police are contacted in the afternoon. He says: 'They sent a couple of members of the police force along to have a look but didn't go far or look very much - they were just sort of assessing the situation.' Thursday May 29: A group of volunteers embark on another search, while a group from the local community also look for Mr Huntley deep into the jungle. The police are 'no longer physically looking', Mr Fisher says. 'I think they were arranging for a search party but nothing happened.' Friday May 30: Janet Southwell, Mr Huntley's mother, calls on the authorities to do more to search for him. She says: 'He has been missing for four days now, and as yet I have had no contact from any official agency advising me as to the progress of the search.' Saturday May 31: A friend of Mr Huntley, Kyle Neo Kai Fu, who lives locally, says: 'The idea that there is a proper professional search going on is laughable. There are five police, in one boat, and nobody is in control. 'The most likely scenario is that Gareth is injured in a ravine, with a broken leg - and we are running out of time.' Ms Southwell makes a direct plea to Prime Minister David Cameron, urging him to 'make one phone call to help my missing son'. Sunday June 1: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, who is in Malaysia, speaks to the country's defence minister. He is assured that the authorities will do all they can to find Mr Huntley and they have already deployed significant assets including dogs, boats and a helicopter. Mr Huntley's girlfriend, Kit Natariga, arrives on the island and warns that 'time is running out and we need action as soon as possible'. Monday June 2: Mr Huntley's mother also arrives on the island to support the search effort. She says she wants to see the area for herself and 'get a feel for where he's lost'. His brother, Mark, says there are 103 people searching, alongside several helicopters and speedboats. David Cameron speaks to Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak to thank him for the extensive efforts of the search teams. Wednesday June 4: Police searching for Mr Huntley find a body.

Rory Rogers, 24, had his future shattered by a single 'haymaker' punch thrown by James Toulouse after a pub row in Saundersfoot, Pembrokeshire. Toulouse, also 24, was jailed for two-and-half years today at Swansea Crown Court after confessing to grievous bodily harm. Rory Rogers, 24, with his fiancée Stacey Mckeowen, 26: Mr Rogers has been in a persistent vegetative state since November when he was floored by a wild punch after a pub row in Saundersfoot, Pembrokeshire . But Mr Rogers' family and his fiancée, Stacey McKeown, 26, fear he faces spending the rest of his life in a persistent vegetative state. Since the attack on November 16 last year he has never regained consciousness and Miss McKeown keeps a daily vigil at his bedside. She was in court yesterday to see Toulouse jailed. But she left in tears after hearing that, taking into account time served on remand, he could be out in just eight months. Guilty: James Toulouse was jailed for two-and-half years at Swansea Crown Court after confessing to grievous bodily harm, but he could be out in months . Swansea Crown Court heard both men were drinking in the Deck bar in the seaside resort of Saundersfoot, Pembrokeshire, and had 'a heated exchange of words'. Mr Rogers left, but Toulouse chased after him, knocked him down with a wild swing to the head and continued to rain down blows on his victim on the ground. Judge Paul Thomas told Toulouse: 'Your haymaker punch caused the damage and left Rory in a persistent vegetative state and he has never regained consciousness. 'As Rory lay on the ground you followed up with kicks and punches. 'You were looking for trouble and liked to portray yourself as the local hard man. 'You simply believed that you had won the fight by knocking him out and you later celebrated and boasted about what you had done.' A haymaker punch is a wild swing whipped sideways from the shoulder, with minimal elbow bend. They are favoured by unskilled fighters who want to cause the most damage with their blows. Jim Davis, prosecuting, said Toulouse 'had intended to inflict serious injury' and that he 'appeared pleased and proud at what he had done.' Toulouse, of Pembroke Dock, Pembrokeshire, showed no reaction as he was jailed for two and a half years after admitting grievous bodily harm. Lives torn apart: Miss Mckeown was in court yesterday to see Toulouse jailed. But she left in tears after hearing that, taking into account time served on remand, he could be out in just eight months . Accomplice: Jason McReynolds was given a 12 month supervision order and told to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work for attempting to pervert the course of justice after he tried to help Toulouse escape . Judge Thomas said: 'A petty drunken row ended with a young man’s life devastated. 'Rory Rogers had a bright future ahead of him but now all is lost to him. 'His family and girlfriend have been left with their lives shattered too.' Toulouse has been in custody since he was arrested over the attack. His friend Jason McReynolds, 20, of Saundersfoot, had tried to help him escape. He was given a 12 month supervision order and told to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work for attempting to pervert the course of justice. Mr Rogers' family, who are from Saundersfoot, have been told by doctors that their son may never recover from the assault. They continue to hold a bedside vigil at Neath Port Talbot Hospital in South Wales.","Rory Rogers has never woken up since the attack on November 16 last year .

"By . Richard Spillett . A woman whose parents were found buried in their back garden has admitted her mother’s manslaughter. Susan Edwards, 56, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Patricia Wycherley but maintained her not guilty plea to two counts of murder at the start of a trial at Nottingham Crown Court. Edwards and her husband Christopher, 57, both deny murdering Mrs Wycherley and her husband William, whose bodies were discovered in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire last October. Susan Edwards (left), 56, has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of her mother, Patricia Wycherley, but she and her husband Christopher Edwards (right) deny murdering Mrs Wycherley and her husband, William . Mr and Mrs Wycherley's remains were recovered from the garden of their home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire last October following a tip-off to police . The remains of Mr and Mrs Wycherley were recovered by police from the grounds of their two-bedroom home last October. The couple are alleged to have been murdered by their daughter and son-in-law between May 1 and 5, 1998. Yesterday Nottinghamshire Police released the first pictures of Mr Wycherley as a young man and prior to his death in the late 1990s. Both Susan and Christopher Edwards, of no fixed address, admitted a charge of obstructing the coroner at an earlier hearing at the same court.

"By . Larisa Brown . It was a hefty withdrawal, so Wendy Cleasby thought taking her cash out inside the bank was the safest option. But that’s exactly where a pair of conmen were waiting to pounce. Just inside the high street branch, the two Romanians who pointed out that she had just dropped £5 were actually tricking her into turning away... so they could steal her money from a cashpoint machine. Wendy Cleasby, 53, was conned by the two Eastern European men as she withdrew money from a cash machine inside Santander bank in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire on May 27 . She said scammers Floran Constantin Serban, 28, and Constantin Radu Serban, 22, (pictured behind her) appeared to be 'polite and charming' and told her she had 'dropped a £5 note' before stealing her cash . Footage shows Mrs Cleasby, 53, bending . down to pick up the note – put there by scammers Floran Constantin . Serban, 28, and Constantin Radu Serban, 22 – while they take the £300 . she had just withdrawn from  the ATM. The . pair have now been jailed for 16 weeks by Teesside magistrates after . admitting the theft – and ordered to pay back the money between them. Mrs . Cleasby said she was withdrawing the cash in a Santander bank in . Middlesbrough when she was approached by the ‘charming and polite’ men. She said: ‘It was a perfectly timed con. ‘They knew what they were doing and must have rehearsed it hundreds of times. One of the men swiped Wendy Cleasby's money from the cash machine while she bent down to pick up the £5 note the scammers conned her into thinking she had dropped. They were arrested after being caught on CCTV . ‘It . was all over within seconds. I had put my pin number in and had pressed . the button for the money and it was at that same moment that the man . told me I had dropped the money.’ The former warehouse worker added: ‘I told him it wasn’t mine, but he said it was as he saw me drop it.’ The . conmen were later arrested after a member of the public recognised them . from a CCTV image released by police. The footage shows the duo waiting . behind Mrs Cleasby as she withdraws the money and checking around to . see if anyone was looking. They can then be seen swiping the money while she turns around and bends down to reach for the £5 note. The men were each handed a 16-week prison sentence after they both admitted a charge of theft at Teesside Magistrates' Court but Mrs Cleasby (pictured) is now warning others to remain vigilant at cash machines . The cost of providing interpreters to assist Romanians appearing at magistrates and crown courts for criminal cases has hit more than £800,000. Freedom of Information requests to the Ministry of Justice revealed that the bill was £804,846 for the period from February 2012 to January 2013. The money was paid to Capita Translation and Interpreting, which won the contract to provide translations services in January 2012. The bill for the final month was £89,387. Previously, courts in England relied on local interpreters. Last month the Mail revealed that the annual cost to the taxpayer of hiring court interpreters to assist all non-English speakers had almost doubled in just one year to £15.5million. Mrs . Cleasby, from Acklam, explained: ‘I bent down to get it and when I got . back up I waited for my cash to come out the machine, but it didn’t . come. 'It said on the screen, “Your transaction has finished” and my card . was given back to me. 'It took me a while to register what had happened . but I then twigged on. Another man had taken the money while I bent . over. I had been completely conned.’ Mrs . Cleasby, who is not working because of a bad back, told a member of . staff what had happened and police were called after the bank’s CCTV . cameras were checked. She added: ‘I was completely shocked and stunned. I just couldn’t believe it. ‘It . is not something you expect to happen. I chose to use the cashpoint . inside the bank rather than the one on the street as I thought it would . be safer. 'Those men had zero respect for me. They didn’t care . whatsoever. They just pounced. ‘It wouldn’t surprise me if they had done it to other people. I was so angry.’ Mrs Cleasby warned other cashpoint users to be vigilant. She . said: ‘The man was very polite when he spoke to me and I had no reason . to doubt him. It just shows that anyone can do these things – you just . don’t know.’","Wendy Cleasby was conned as she withdrew cash from Santander bank .

"By . Tara Brady . Guilty: Janet Goldstone stole £72,228 from company accounts over three years and has now been jailed for 21 months . A bookkeeper has been jailed for swindling her employer out of more than £70,000 to pay for foreign holidays, a new car and her son’s wedding. Three Way Precision Sheet Metal, in Shoebury, Essex, was forced to lay off staff, after Janet Goldstone stole £72,228 from company accounts over three years. She was only caught when one director became suspicious after she pestered him to sign off company cheques just weeks before she went on holiday. Paul Whitehouse took a note of the payee and visited the company named on the cheque where he discovered Three Way Precision Metals no longer had an account with them. He contacted the bank and found Goldstone had altered the cheque to pay herself the money. Goldstone, 52, from Canvey, was handed a 21 month prison sentence when she appeared at Basildon Crown Court on Monday. The court heard Goldstone started working for the company, based in Towerfield Road, in 2006 as a temporary book keeper. She was eventually taken on permanently, in a role that paid £25,000 per year, and was responsible for payroll, BACS payments and company cheques. Between 2009 and 2012 she raised 34 cheques, worth £29,000, paid to herself and her husband’s bank account. She also made 37 BACS payments to herself totalling £42,000. She would write cheques out in pencil, get them signed by the company directors, then change the details on the cheque. The court heard she initially stole the cash to pay for repairs to her home after it was ruined by a cowboy builder. However, she became greedy frittering the money on exotic holidays to Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Mexico. She also bought a Range Rover and put £2,500 behind the bar at her son’s wedding reception. Three Way Precision Sheet Metal, in Shoebury, Essex, (pictured) was forced to lay off staff following the fraud . The court heard Goldstone lied to her family and friends about where the cash came from - telling them she had received a PPI payout. Company . director Ronald Williams said: 'We trusted her. The three company . directors have given their lives to building up this company. 'This has had a huge impact on us. We have had to lay off staff and have suffered sleepless nights and ill health.' Matthew Bone, mitigating said his client was now 'a shell of her former self'. Greedy: Janet Goldstone swindled £70,000 to pay for holidays to Jamaica, Cuba and Mexico (file picture) He said: 'She won’t forgive herself for what she has done. 'She feels worthless and was extremely distressed when she heard of the redundancies' Matthew Bone, mitigating . 'She feels worthless and was extremely distressed when she heard of the redundancies.' Goldstone, who was dressed in a baby pink shirt and jeans sobbed as she was sentenced by Recorder Martyn Royall. He said: 'This was an abuse of your position as bookkeeper and a serious breach of trust. 'You have heard the shock and disappointment of the directors. 'I have no other option than to make a custodial sentence.' Speaking after the trial, Mr Whitehouse who uncovered the scam said: 'This incident has really undermined our trust in people. 'We are pleased with the outcome - she put the business under a lot of threat. 'We trusted her and because of what happened the firm has had to cut back on staff and machinery. 'Since this incident, our staffing levels have dropped from about 100 to 50. 'It is disappointing and upsetting because we were always very fair with her.'","Janet Goldstone stole £72,228 from company accounts over three years .

"By . Damien Gayle . Yob: Matthew Tisdale, who walked free from court despite admitting assaulting a ticket inspector, pushing her from the train and spitting in her face . A thug has walked free from court despite admitting to attacking a ticket collector and spitting in her face. Matthew Tisdale, 21, shoved Louise Caisley, 37, off the Arriva Trains service at Welshpool Railway Station, Powys, after he tried to board without a ticket. The yob had jumped on the 7.47pm train to Newtown, Shropshire, when he was confronted by Ms Caisley, the conductor, over his fare. A court heard he swore at her and said he was getting on 'no matter what' before shoving her on to the platform and pressing a button to lock the door. Tisdale then approached the train driver and signalled for him that it was OK to leave the station. But the driver realised something was amiss and ejected Tisdale before phoning police. At Welshpool Magistrates Court, Tisdale, of Newtown, admitted charges of endangering the safety of people on a railway, assault by beating and interfering with automatic doors on a railway over the inciden on January 8. He also pleaded guilty to trespassing on the railway at Abbey Foregate, Shropshire, in a separate incident on March 17. But on Tuesday he nevertheless escaped jail when he was handed 250 hours of unpaid work and a 12-month community order. He was also ordered to pay £50 compensation, £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. Prosecutor Helen Tench told the court: 'The conductor, Louise Caisley, asked him to present a ticket while boarding and he said he didn't have one and did not have the money to pay. 'He then pushed into her as he tried to get on the train and a grapple broke out with the conductor suffering reddening to her face as a result of force used by the defendant. 'He then spat at her and the amount was so large that it showed up on CCTV later viewed by police. 'The conductor then ended up on the platform and Tisdale jumped on board closing the doors and then pressing another button which locked the doors. 'He tried to signal to the driver to move on but the driver realised what had happened and came to the conductor's aid and Tisdale was ejected and the police were called.' Victim: Louise Caisley, 37, who was shoved form the train when she tried to ask Tisdale for his ticket . The court heard Tisdale refused to co-operate with officers and didn't even attended any arranged police interviews. Ceri Edwards, defending, said in mitigation: 'For a man of his age, my client has an unenviable record building up. 'He was formerly a successful young man who had achieved much in school and was a highly thought of young member of the local Labour Party.'","Matthew Tisdale attacked Louise Caisley she asked to see his ticket .

"By . Emma Glanfield . People in Glasgow are among the most unhelpful in Britain, according to a unique experiment which tested how many individuals carry out good deeds across the UK. As part of the unique test, 850 tagged keys were dropped in 15 cities across the country and researchers measured how many ended up at their ‘owner's’ destination. Oxford and Cambridge proved to be the most trustworthy cities in Britain, with eight out of 10 keys (80 per cent) being returned to their rightful ‘owner’. Glasgow was found to be the least altruistic city in the UK, with only one in three keys (34 per cent) being returned to their 'owner' in the study, which was carried out by lost property retrieval service Keyfetch.com . However, Glasgow and Newcastle proved to be the least altruistic with only one in three keys turning up again. Online lost property retrieval service Keyfetch.com carried out the National Altruism Study (NAS) and a survey in which it quizzed 2,000 people about their altruism. In the survey, an overwhelming nine out of ten Brits said they would return a missing set of keys if they had a way to notify the owner (90 per cent). But the findings from the key-drop experiment revealed just six in 10 people (59 per cent) actually did when given the chance. Newcastle - 4 minutes . Edinburgh - 5 minutes . Leeds - 6 minutes . Cambridge - 6 minutes . More than one in three people said keys were more valuable than wallets, laptops or even a mobile phone (37 per cent). The experiment, which dropped between 50 and 100 keys in each of the 15 cities, found that six out of 10 keys which were returned were reunited with their owner within 24 hours (60 per cent). Overall, the average return time was six hours. One resident in Newcastle alerted the owner of the missing key within a speedy four minutes of the item being lost. People in Oxford were quicker to alert owners than their Cambridge rivals, typically beating them by seven and a half hours. Cambridge topped Oxford's fastest return time of 36 minutes by half an hour to score equal fourth quickest in the country. As part of the unique test, 850 tagged keys were dropped in 15 cities across the country and researchers measured how many ended up at their 'owners' destination . Dr Brendan Burchell, head of sociology at University of Cambridge, said busy modern life sometimes gets in the way of ethics. Dr Burchell said: ‘The fast-paced nature of modern life means that, even when we know it would be ethical to act in a certain way, our best intentions are not acted upon. Cambridge - 80 per cent . Belfast - 80 per cent . Oxford - 80 per cent . Brighton - 74 per cent . Bristol - 74 per cent . London - 68 per cent . Edinburgh - 60 per cent . Leeds - 59 per cent . Manchester - 56 per cent . Plymouth - 54 per cent . Birmingham - 46 per cent . Liverpool - 44 per cent . Cardiff - 40 per cent . Newcastle - 38 per cent . Glasgow - 34 per cent . ‘The National Altruism Study shows that when we make it easy for people to be ethical, then a high proportion show acts of kindness to complete strangers. ‘If it is made easy to return keys without, for instance, having to make a time-consuming trip to a lost-property office or a police station then a high proportion of people act with empathy and compassion.’ Young people are most likely to lose their valuables, with 70 per cent having lost their keys at least once, the study found. Dr Burchell added: ‘Keyfetch's National Altruism Study highlights a number of important societal issues. ‘Sociologists have found that countries and cities differ in what we call 'Social Capital', or norms of trust and reciprocity between people. ‘Returning keys, a simple act of kindness, is an expression of a social capital. ‘Those cities where the lost keys had higher rates of being returned are probably the cities where people model small acts of kindness, courtesy and respect to each other on a daily basis. ‘The study's findings suggest Social Capital is stronger in the cities of Cambridge, Oxford and Belfast.’ John Candillier, co-founder of Keyfetch.com, said: ‘We know that people are intrinsically good. ‘The National Altruism Study gave the United Kingdom the opportunity to prove just that. ‘When polled, more than half of the nation admit having lost their keys. ‘Fuelled by the goodwill of others, Keyfetch makes this unfortunate situation less stressful and costly. ‘Altruism is the heartbeat of society, it unites people and makes them a community.'","People in Glasgow and Newcastle found to be among most unhelpful in UK .

Bridger, 48, who is serving life for kidnapping . and murdering the five-year-old girl, has complained of threats and . mistreatment by fellow inmates at HMP Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

'He . murdered a five-and-a-half year old girl, and he can’t take people . saying things to him, and banging on his door,' said Mrs Jones. 'He’s killed a little girl. I think it’s disgusting that he can ask to be moved, just because he’s being threatened. 'I . hope he’s threatened every day for the rest of his life. Every day I’m . suffering - I’ve got a lifetime of hell to live through. 'He’s made me ill, I’ve lost so much weight and I’m still not feeling right. Him wanting to be moved is disgusting. He did the crime, now he’s got to do the time.' Father-of-six Bridger snatched April near . her home in Machynlleth, Wales in October 2012 and was given a whole-life tariff by a . judge in May 2013 at Mold Crown Court. Inmates: It has been reported that fellow criminals at HMP Wakefield (pictured) are unhappy at Bridger¿s bid to claim compensation for the assault . Mother's grief: Coral Jones, pictured with her husband Phil, says Bridger should not be allowed to move prisons, and that she hopes 'he's threatened every day for the rest of his life' The five-year-old's body has never . been found. In July last . year, Bridger was attacked and slashed across his face by Juvinai . Ferreira, 22, an inmate who is serving a life sentence for murder. He was said to have needed hospital treatment for a face wound, but was returned to Wakefield after his injury was stitched. It has been reported that fellow criminals at HMP Wakefield are unhappy at Bridger’s bid to claim compensation for the assault. He could be paid as much as £15,000 after he was slashed with a makeshift knife, while April's parents look set to receive just £11,000 in compensation for their daughter's death. Bridger has reportedly asked to be moved to another prison - because he is allegedly being 'mistreated' by fellow inmates, and is said to be worried by the prospect of another attack. A prison source said the father-of-six ‘moans continually’ about his situation, and has asked for papers to request a move. If Wakefield governor, Susan Howard, finds reasons to support a move, she could contact other maximum security prisons like York’s Full Sutton or Frankland jail near Durham to see if they will take him, according to the Mirror. Alternative: If Wakefield governor, Susan Howard, finds reasons to support a move, she could contact other prisons like York's Full Sutton (pictured) or Frankland jail near Durham to see if they will take him . But the paper’s source said Bridger would be a ‘marked man’ wherever he goes. Machynlleth councillor Mike Williams added: 'I don’t advocate any form of violence, including the attack on Bridger, but I’m happy the full course of justice has taken place, and he should be prepared to stand his sentence. 'People don’t take kindly to child murderers.' In January, Bridger abandoned an appeal against his sentence, 11 days before the hearing. He will die behind bars, after judges rejected a European ruling that no-parole terms breached human rights. A prison service spokesman said the Ministry of Justice does not comment on how inmates move prisons for 'security reasons', and could not comment on Bridger reported wish to leave HMP Wakefield. She added: 'We do not comment on individuals.'","Bridger, 48, is serving life for kidnap and murder of five-year-old April .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A force has taken delivery of the world’s fastest police car in a bid to slow motorists down - although it won’t actually be going out on the streets. Avon and Somerset Police Force is using the 350bhp Ariel Atom as part of a campaign to encourage motorcyclists to curb their speed. Based on the latest Atom 3.5R, the car has the latest aerodynamic Hella pursuit lights and emergency equipment. Blues and twos: Avon and Somerset police are using the 350bhp Ariel Atom as part of a campaign to encourage motorcyclists to curb their speed although it is hoped the motorcyclists are on the correct side of the road . Roadblock: Avon and Somerset Police hope that this car will persuade motorcyclists to slow down . The £38,000-car can reach 62mph in just 2½ seconds and a variant of the model holds the lap record at the Top Gear test track. That makes it faster than the Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4 Polizia used by Italian police, the Audi R8 GTR driven by officers in Germany, and a Ferrari FF used in Dubai. Avon and Somerset Police has borrowed the Atom from local manufacturer Ariel for the summer while it promotes its new campaign, Safer Rider. It is . hoped the eye-catching machine will dissuade bikers from riding . dangerously as it is displayed at promotional events across the . southwest. Seven motorcyclists have lost their lives already this year in the area, a 30 per cent increase on this time last year.

Stand by for action: Avon and Somerset Police's Sgt Andy Parsons will be displaying the 350bhp Ariel Atom at shows around the southwest this summer . Andy Parsons, a Roads Policing Sergeant with the Tri Force Specialist Operations Collaboration, who is heading the campaign, thinks that the Ariel Atom will be just what they need to promote safer riding. ‘I am really excited that Ariel has joined with us to bring Project Safer Rider to fruition, and I hope that the use of the Ariel PL1 with have a positive impact to promote Road Safety in line with our PCC's Priorities, and help us to reduce road death and serious injury,’ he said. ‘To be safe, rider and machine need to work in harmony. When this happens it feels immediately right. When it doesn't, things go wrong. Too many injuries and deaths are the result of rider error.’ The Atom has been unveiled as the number of motorcyclists on the road increases drastically over the summer months, with 20 per cent of all deaths on UK roads involving bikers. Motorcyclists are also 35 times more likely to be killed in a road collision, something that the campaign hopes to reduce. Simon Saunders, the director of Ariel said: ‘Our business is about going fast, very fast, but there is a time and a place. The Atom is designed to be driven to a race track, where you can drive to your limits in safety and in a professional environment designed for the purpose. ‘The road really isn't the place to explore your or your vehicle's limits.’ The new car will be unveiled to the public on June 8 in Somerset alongside a host of other police vehicles, with the day also offering training and information for bikers.

She was struck off the register after colleagues told how she fell asleep in a patient's bed . Her colleagues then saw Gammack passed out in an elderly patient’s bed. Nursing home manager John Haydon said: 'She was very drunk. There was no other reason for the way she was that day. 'She had a glazed look on her face. She was unsteady on her feet and her speech was slurred. She kept asking me to help her.' Mr Haydon called an ambulance to check her out. But the paramedics couldn’t get into the car park - because Gammack’s car was blocking the ambulance bay. The Council fitness to practice hearing was told Mr Haydon went out to move the car and discovered a quarter full 75cl bottle of vodka in the glove box and a half full bottle of mouthwash. The nurse's colleagues described how the 48-year-old drank from a bottle of vodka in her car throughout the day - a claim she denies (library image) But in a statement, Gammack said she had finish drinking before coming to work - and had not had any booze after her shift started. She said: 'I had consumed alcohol up to a few hours before as sleep eluded me. 'I kept using mouthwash to make sure I didn’t smell of alcohol on that day.' Gammack, of Denbigh, North Wales, claims she had a panic attack before being taken to hospital and discharged the next day. She admitted working under the influence of alcohol, sleeping in a patient’s bed and leaving the home without telling the nurse in charge. The disciplinary panel sitting in Cardiff struck her Gammack off the nursing register for 18 months. Panel chairman John Matharu said: “It was only through chance that residents were not harmed as a result of her actions and the consequences could have been grave. 'We came to the conclusion that the misconduct, taken together with the lack of full remorse, insight and remediation, are fundamentally incompatible with continuing to be a registered nurse. 'The panel has reached the conclusion that a striking off order is the only order which will sufficiently protect the public interest.' Gammack, who has previous convictions for drink-driving and common assault, was immediately dismissed by the nursing home for her New Year’s Eve behaviour.","Christine Gammack, 48, turned up for work at Bryn Marl nursing home in Conwy, Wales, after celebrating New Year's Eve .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A man who dived into a river to help a desperate mother save a helpless child from drowning after her pram rolled off a quayside has relived the heroic moment today. Victor Martinez, 51, said he didn't think twice about plunging in to Exeter Quay in Devon after the pram rolled into the water with the young girl strapped inside. The rower jumped . into the water with teammates Stuart Menzies and Andy Travers - who . were in the city to take part in the British Dragon Boat race. Speaking today he said: 'I was standing on the side with other members of my team - The Raging Dragons - when I heard a deafening scream. The young girl's mother, right, leapt into the water after her daughter's buggy rolled into the River Exe at Exeter Quay in Devon during a dragon boat racing event . Quick-thinking passers-by also flung themselves into the water and the toddler, who is believed to be about a year old, was brought back to the safety of the quayside . Victor Martinez, 51, said he didn't think twice about jumping in to help with the dramatic rescue . ‘At first I wondered why the woman was . so worried about a pram, but then I saw the baby girl’s arms flailing . on both sides of the buggy. ‘I . didn’t think about it, I just ran and dived straight in the water. I . think I hit the water at the same time as the buggy. I didn’t think . twice.’ Quick-thinking passers-by also flung . themselves into the water and the toddler. Recalling the events, Mr Martinez said: 'The buggy was sinking quickly and I dived down to get under it to try push it to the surface' Mr Martinez added: ‘The buggy was sinking quickly and I dived down to get under it to try push it to the surface. ‘It . was getting heavier and heavier, and me and my teammate Stuart Menzies, . who jumped in after me, were struggling to push it up.’ ‘I thought about unstrapping the baby but I just kept thinking we have to get her to the surface quickly. ‘We managed to get her to the top and I was struggling to keep the buggy at the surface when I saw the girl’s face for the first time - she was screaming and crying but I looked into her eyes which were full of river water and just thought that she wasn’t going to drown today. ‘I think seeing her face gave me the extra push and we managed to get the pram to the wall.’ The hero eventually managed to get the child back up to the surface - before pulling her towards dry land. Once on the side of the quay, Mr Martinez’s son Victor reached down and helped to pull the buggy and child to the top of the wall. Mr Martinez then swam back over to the mother before helping her out of the water. ‘I could still hear the mother screaming, she was in deep shock so I just went over to her and grabbed her face,’ he said. ‘She was shaking so much, I looked her in the eyes and told her that her baby needs her now.’ Bystanders and the first aid team for the dragon boat race helped look after the child and checked her over for injuries. Jenny Wisson was one of the first on the scene and helped dress the girl in her son’s spare clothes after she was pulled out in the dramatic rescue. Witnesses said the mother and child were sat watching the event when the buggy rolled into the water . Bystanders and the first aid team for the dragon boat race helped look after the child and checked her over for injuries . She said: ‘I heard a bloodcurdling scream at which point I looked over and saw a few people jumping in. 'It wasn’t until I got nearer I realised it was a baby in a pushchair.’ Eyewitness Debbie Manning, of the Cambridgeshire Royals Dragon Boat club, added: ‘It was incredible to see. ‘It was all quite a drama but thankfully everybody seemed to be OK.’ The British Dragon Boat Racing Association, which put on the event, praised the actions of the rescuers. A spokesman said: 'There was some . serious additional drama when a pram complete with small child strapped . in ended up falling into the river at The Quay. 'I think seeing her face gave me the extra push and we managed to get the pram to the wall' - Rescuer Victor Martinez . ‘Thanks to some quick-thinking by Stuart Menzies, Vic Martinez and Andy Travers of Raging Dragons who jumped in to rescue the child and pram, it had a happy ending with the child seemingly ending up without a scratch, though a little wet. ‘There were even a couple of midwives in the Worcester crew who were able to help check everything was okay with the child. ‘After some time to recover from the shock of the ordeal, the mother and baby were last seen heading home away from the water. ‘Thank you to all those involved in the rescue and preventing a much more serious and easily life-threatening situation.’ The youngster later appeared to be seemingly well and was seen laughing but was taken to hospital by her mother for a check-up as a precaution.","Young girl was strapped into buggy when it rolled into River Exe in Devon .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Brendan McBride, 19, died after getting his arm stuck in a charity clothes bin in Bradford, an inquest was told . A teenager died after getting stuck trying to climb into a clothes bank where he was hoping to sleep for the night, an inquest heard. Brendan McBride, 19, was found by a passer-by suspended by his arm from the metal hatch of a charity clothes bin in Bradford.  He had bled to death. It is thought that Mr McBride had been standing on a plastic container trying to reach into the bin when he slipped, trapping his arm and leaving him hanging. He was found by a member of the public walking to work next morning but pronounced dead at the scene. An inquest in Bradford heard how the hatch of the Save The Mothers Trust clothes bank in the Great Horton area of Bradford had caused a serious arm injury which led to significant blood loss. Mr McBride’s mother, Paula Denison, 44, from Bradford, said: 'I don't know why he would have been trying to get into the bin that night - he could have been looking for somewhere to sleep.' 'He had a home here [where] he could have a bed, a meal, a bath when he wanted.  He'd spend a couple of nights here, maybe, then at his dad's or his friend's.' Mrs Denison, who has four other children, told the inquest she thought she had heard knocking on her door at midnight the night before her son's body was found. She said: 'I thought I heard knocking at the back door at about midnight.  A neighbour said they heard something too, but I didn’t answer the door. 'Now I’m worried it could have been him.  I’ll have to live with that guilt.' Assistant Bradford Coroner, Dr Dominic Bell, was told Mr McBride had been drinking the night before he was found and had told his mother he was going to visit friends. She told him to be back by 9.30pm, but he never returned. Mrs Denison said her son had started drinking too much after losing a job he loved at a car breakers’ yard. She said: 'We were worried about him.  When he was working he loved being busy, but then when the job went it all changed, everything started going down and he drank too much... Location: Mr McBride was found by a passer-by near here in the Great Horton district of Bradford . The recently-unemployed teenager was found near Beckside Lane on 23 May by someone walking to work . 'We are all heartbroken.  All we wanted for him was to enjoy his life, get another job and to be happy.' She added: 'It was a freak accident that no-one could have predicted, and in the end no-one could have stopped.' Save The Mothers Trust spokesman, Mohammad Shahid, said the charity would now be putting up a bigger fence made from metal. He said: 'We have been saying prayers for the young man and his family.' The inquest continues.","A passer-by found Brendan McBride, 19, suspended from a clothes bank .

"By . Leon Watson . NASA has released a stunning new panorama that shows the cosmos at its most colorful. The incredible image was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope and, for the first time, includes ultraviolet light, which is normally not visible to the human eye. It shows up in the photo as bright baby blue with spinning galaxies, which are about five to 10 billion years old, not too old or young in cosmic terms. The Hubble team have unveiled the most colorful view of universe yet after it was captured by the space telescope . The photo - made from 841 orbits of telescope viewing time - shows about 10,000 multi-colored galaxies, extending back in time to within a few hundred million years of the big bang. Hubble astronomer Zolt Levay said by adding ultraviolet and infrared to the pictures, people can now see the universe in the broad spectrum of color 'and then some.' Astronomers previously studied the Hubble Ultra Deep Field in visible and near-infrared light in a series of images captured from 2003 to 2009. But using ultraviolet light, astronomers have combined the full range of colors available to Hubble, stretching all the way from ultraviolet to near-infrared light. Principal investigator Harry Teplitz of Caltech in Pasadena, California, said: 'The lack of information from ultraviolet light made studying galaxies in the HUDF like trying to understand the history of families without knowing about the grade-school children. 'The addition of the ultraviolet fills in this missing range.' The Hubble Space Telescope is seen in this picture taken from a space shuttle . The Hubble Space Telescope was carried into orbit by a Space Shuttle in 1990 . Hubble's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared . Its orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to take extremely high-resolution images with almost no background light . Hubble's Deep Field has recorded some of the most detailed visible-light images ever, allowing a deep view into space and time . The telescope is one of NASA's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope . Hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts . Its scientific successor, the James Webb Space Telescope is currently scheduled to be launched by Nasa in 2018. Ultraviolet light comes from the hottest, largest, and youngest stars. By observing at these wavelengths, researchers get a direct look at which galaxies are forming stars and where the stars are forming within those galaxies. Studying the ultraviolet images of galaxies in this intermediate time period enables astronomers to understand how galaxies grew in size by forming small collections of very hot stars. Because Earth's atmosphere filters most ultraviolet light, this work can only be accomplished with a space-based telescope. 'Ultraviolet surveys like this one using the unique capability of Hubble are incredibly important in planning for NASA's James Webb Space Telescope,' said team member Rogier Windhorst of Arizona State University in Tempe. 'Hubble provides an invaluable ultraviolet-light dataset that researchers will need to combine with infrared data from Webb. 'This is the first really deep ultraviolet image to show the power of that combination.'","Stunning image was captured using, for the first time, ultraviolet light .

"By . Amanda Willliams . A speeding motorist who killed a cyclist as she wheeled her bike across a pedestrian crossing has escaped punishment - because there was no 'official' road sign saying he was in a 30mph limit. Michael Campbell, 40, had been accelerating at up to 49mph in the 30mph zone when he mowed down businesswoman Jaye Bloomfield, 44,  in Manchester city centre. He was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Campbell was not charged after it emerged that instead of a standard 30mph sign, contractors had left a red 'unofficial' speed limit sign on the road - which he had not seen. Michael Campbell, who killed a cyclist as she wheeled her bike across a pedestrian crossing has escaped punishment, because there was no 'official' road sign saying he was in a 30mph limit . According to prosecution teams, Campbell would have been unaware he had to legally slow down, and so charges could not be brought. Had he been charged and convicted, he could have faced up to 14 years in jail. Ms Bloomfield’s family have revealed they are suing Campbell following an inquest into her death. The driver had been accelerating at up to 49mph in the 30mph zone when his car mowed down businesswoman Jaye Bloomfield, 44 . Ms Bloomfield, from Whalley Range, Manchester was a planning technician but had recently completed a college course and she was in the process of setting up her web design business. Ms Bloomfield had tired the knot with her partner of eight years Gemma Godden, 37, in a civil ceremony in August 2012 and the couple were making plans to celebrated their 'paper' anniversary. Ms Godden said: 'Jaye would often cycle to work but if it was a longer distance we would drive. She was a keen cyclist and always cycled with a helmet.' The tragedy occurred on August 3 last year when Jaye was cycling on the slip road heading from Princess Road in Manchester onto the Mancunian Way. Motorist Matthew Collier said: 'I stopped at a pelican crossing and a number of pedestrians went across. I saw Jaye and from my recollection she was pushing her bike with her feet across it, straddling the bike. 'Just before the lights changed I saw a car on the right coming around the corner. 'I commented to my wife that the car was going quite fast. Shortly after we heard a loud bang and when we looked over we saw some debris on the road and I thought maybe someone had been hit.' His wife Sharon added: 'I saw Jaye come across. I remembered her because she had electric blue shorts that you could see under her clothes. We saw a silver and black car come around at an exceedingly high speed. 'At the time we were not sure if it was the silver or black car that hit and we didn’t know it was Jaye. She had gone over at a normal walking pace.' Another witness Noor Abu spoke to Campbell moments after the incident and said: 'He was in a shock. I told him to take it easy. 'He had his head in his hands and was sat on the floor. He was kind of mumbling although I could not make anything out from what he was saying.' Campbell, who had been driving a Seat TDI, told the inquest: 'At the roundabout I looked right and there was nothing coming so I merged to the left. 'I could see the pedal cyclist under the bridge going the same direction as me. It was just a glance. The traffic lights were green so I accelerated. Scene: The tragedy occurred on August 3 last year when Jaye was cycling on the slip road heading from Princess Road in Manchester onto the Mancunian Way (pictured) 'I heard something hit the car and thought it had come from above. I immediately stopped in the middle of the road and looked to my left and saw someone in the road. I ran to the person, confused. 'I did not notice the red sign. It was saying 30mph on the roundabout but on the way to the motorway I thought it was 50. I don’t think that sign was very visible.' Ms Bloomfield suffered fatal head and chest injuries and died at the scene. Senior investigating officer Ian Beaumont told the Manchester inquest: 'We understand the Seat Leon TDI to have been travelling at around 41-49mph which is in excess of the 30mph speed limit. 'But I understand that the driver did not see Jaye. Damage: Campbell was not charged after it emerged that instead of a standard 30mph sign, contractors had left a red 'unofficial' speed limit sign on the road - which he had not seen . Error: The inquest was told the official 30mph sign was due to be erected at this location. The mangled railings can be seen in this photo where the crash happened . 'The CPS had a consultation and as a result of that they determined no further action against Mr Campbell would be taken in response to the matter. They deemed there was no realistic prospect of conviction in this case.” 'There should be a sign indicating the speed limit but this was incorrectly placed by contractors. There was no specific sign to indicate the speed limit was 30mph. 'The pedestrian crossing is placed in the middle of the motorway essentially. It isn’t meant for cyclist but for the movement of pedestrians.' The inquest was told the official 30mph sign was due to be erected. Tributes left at the scene to the 'passionate cyclist'. Ms Bloomfield had married her partner of eight years Gemma Godden, 37, in a civil ceremony in August 2012 and the couple were making plans to celebrated their 'paper' anniversary . Recording a narrative verdict Manchester Assistant coroner Fiona Borrill said: 'I shall be writing a letter to Manchester City Council to find out when the signs will be in place and what progress has been made in respect to this improvement. I am looking to find a time scale.' After the case in a statement, Ms Godden said: 'I have lost the partner I loved and wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I miss her every day as do her family and friends. 'We both loved cycling but this terrible accident once again highlights the dangers cyclists face from motorists driving at speed. 'I urge drivers to respect the speed limit. If the driver who hit Jaye had been driving at 30mph or below as he should have been, he would almost certainly have seen her and been able to stop. 'I want police to clamp down on speeding drivers and I want drivers to realise that cyclists are all someone’s loved one. Please look out for cyclists and give them space on the roads.' The family solicitor Carol Jackson from Manchester law firm Pannone said, 'We are advising Gemma as to the possibility of a civil action against the driver of the car.'","Michael Campbell, 40, hit pedestrian Jaye Bloomfield, 44,  in Manchester .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Mastermind: Former Army sergeant Paul Alexander, 58, who became a millionaire supplying hundreds of illegal firearms to criminals is facing another life sentence for continuing the business from prison . A former Army sergeant who became a . millionaire supplying hundreds of illegal firearms to criminals is . facing another life sentence for continuing the business from his prison . cell. Paul Alexander, 58, masterminded the operation from his cell . at HMP Swaleside in Kent for 10 months with the help of fellow inmates, . friends and family, including his wife and stepdaughter. Alexander, who served his country for 20 years with the Royal Artillery, was already part way through a life sentence after he was caught selling 'assassin kits' - black plastic briefcases containing a handgun, magazine, cartridges and silencer - to gangs for £1,500 a time. Police believe the guns Alexander supplied have been used in hundreds of robberies and killings. His DNA was found on weapons supplied to the Croxteth Crew, who shot dead 11-year-old Liverpool schoolboy Rhys Jones in August 2007. His fingerprints were also found on weapons used in another murder and four attempted murders. Links to guns provided by Alexander were further found in gangland shootings in Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham, Derby and Luton. Remarkably, Alexander, who prior to his arrest had lived a life of luxury in a £2.5m farmhouse . complete with tennis courts and swimming pool set in four acres in the . village of Bardfield Saling, Essex, was still allowed access to gun magazines in prison. A list of suppliers names and addresses was also found in his cell. Prosecutor Victor Temple QC told Woolwich Crown Court that Alexander picked up where he left off when he met 'right-hand man' Carl Gordon, 27, who was serving life for murder, in Swaleside, in 2011. The pair took advantage of the 'lax' security systems in place at the category B prison, which Skull Cracker Michael Wheatley escaped from last month, to smuggle in phones so they could contact arms suppliers. Accomplice: Alexander met 'right-hand man' Carl Gordon (left), 27, in prison, while wife Caroline Hunter-Mann-Purdy (right) was also involved in the scheme . The weapons, which are not illegal to buy if they do not fire, were then converted into deadly firearms. The prosecutor said: 'Alexander was the overall organiser and ringleader. He coordinated the selling of firearms from his prison cell using the illegally acquired mobile phones. 'He used his wife and stepdaughter to communicate with others involved and used the family address as a base. 'All the defendants, particularly Alexander, knew that the firearms were going to end up in the hands of criminals who would not hesitate to use them for the purpose of violent crime, to rob, to maim, to endanger life.' During a previous hearing, Mr Temple had said that Alexander had 'expertise' in weapons following his time in the Army. The court heard the workshop used to covert the antique.44 calibre guns into firing weapons has never been found. Involved: Alexander's step-daughter Lullahbelle Purdy, 26, (left) admitted money laundering funds from the racket, and Gordon's girlfriend Sherika Abbot-Holder, 27, (right) was convicted of conspiring to supply firearms . Gang: Leon Brown, 31, (left) admitted conspiring to transfer ammunition and David Joseph, 28, (right) admitted conspiring to supply firearms with intent to danger life . Letters to his wife Caroline Hunter-Mann-Purdy, 64, showed how heavily she was involved in his activities, the court heard. Gordon's role was 'instrumental' in finding customers and establishing safe houses where the guns and ammunition could be stored, the court was told. James Scobie QC, representing Alexander, said he pleaded guilty to conspiring to supply firearms with intent to endanger life in the 'full knowledge they could end up in the wrong hands.' But he said Gordon, 27 was just as important to the racket at Alexander. Mr Scobie said he had access to gun magazines from the moment he entered prison as they were already in his cell. Find: A firearm recovered by police during their investigation into Alexander . Weapon: James Scobie QC, representing Alexander, said he pleaded guilty to conspiring to supply firearms with intent to endanger life in the 'full knowledge they could end up in the wrong hands' 'The temptation was there and he took it. And now he's right back at the bottom,' he said. Speaking about Alexander's career he said: 'He had an exemplary Army record, he spent 20 years in the Army and was in the Royal Artillery. He spent time in the special services and was somebody who was an asset to the community. 'He is remorseful not only to the court but to his family.' The court heard since he's been in prison Alexander, who has written two novels, has helped illiterate prisoners learn to read. Gordon, his girlfriend Sherika Abbot-Holder, 27, and another woman Emma Jones, 26, all from west London, were convicted of conspiring to supply firearms. Discovery: Ammunition found by police. Of the 11 weapons sold by Alexander¿s arms network, only four have since been recovered . Bullets: Gordon's role was 'instrumental' in finding customers and establishing safe houses where the guns and ammunition could be stored, the court was told . Deadly: The .44 weapons, which are not illegal to buy if they do not fire, were then converted into deadly firearms . Alexander, from Bath, admitted conspiring to supply firearms with intent to danger life, as did his wife, and friend David Joseph, 28. Hunter-Mann-Purdy's daughter Lullahbelle Purdy, 26, of Harwich, Essex, admitted money laundering funds from the racket. Another man Leon Brown, 31, of Plaistow, east London, admitted conspiring to transfer ammunition. Alexander retired from the Army with an exemplary record in 1992 but started his own business converting blank-firing guns into lethal weapons. He managed to avoid detection for years by using 33 aliases including the surnames Hunter-Mann, Bourne and Bauer - the latter two after Jason Bourne, the action movie hero, and Jack Bauer, the lead character in the TV thriller series 24. But he was finally jailed indefinitely in 2009. Of the 11 weapons sold by Alexander’s arms network, only four have since been recovered. The sentencing continues.","Ex-Royal Artillery sergeant Paul Alexander served in the Army for 20 years .

"By . Jennifer Newton . White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite posed as a UN aid worker in a bid to try and trick police into escorting her to a military base so she could bomb Kenyan soldiers in Somalia, it has been reported. The British fugitive, who is a mother-of-four and originally from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, is said to be one of the leading players in Somalia's radical al-Shabaab group. The Muslim convert, aged 30, is on the run after she was suspected of helping to coordinate last September's attack on a Nairobi shopping mall in which 67 people were killed including five Britons. Samantha Lewthwaite, also known as the White Widow, who is thought to have posed as a UN aid worker in a plot to bomb Kenyan troops . According to security sources in Kenya, a woman fitting Lewthwaite's description, tried to trick police into escorting her to a military base using fake documents in April. But it is thought border officials in the coastal town of Lamu stopped her and she left with three men before they had a chance to question her. A security source told the Daily Mirror: 'This could have been one of the biggest chances to catch Samantha Lewthwaite. 'There are severe suspicions this was an audacious attempt to reach the camp in Ras Kamboni to plant an explosion and murder scores of soldiers.' Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, pictured, who killed 26 people in the London Tube train attacks in July 2005 . It is also believed that Lewthwaite and the men fled in the same Toyota 4x4, which was used in the shooting of two soldiers in Milmani last week. Last week sources claimed the British fugitive married suspected warlord Hassan Maalim Ibrahim who is also known as Sheikh Hassan. He is a senior commander in the radical terror group al-Shabaab which is linked to al-Qaeda. Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations. She is thought to be part of the Somali terror group al-Shabaab, pictured, who are linked to al Qaeda . She was the daughter of a former soldier before converting to Islam and is believed to have moved to Kenya in 2007, just months after she condemned the deadly role her husband Lindsay played in the 7/7 London bombings that killed 52. She moved to South Africa in 2008 and adopted the identity of an unsuspecting young woman who had moved to the UK with her parents as a baby. Lewthwaite went into hiding in December 2011 after she convinced anti-terror police to let her go when she was arrested following a raid on an al-Shabaab cell.","British fugitive is said to be one of the leading players in al-Shabaab .

"By . Steve Doughty . Fined: It was the second embarrassment in a matter of weeks for TV chef Jamie Oliver's empire . His restaurants boast of their eco-friendly credentials and he has featured in Government-funded recycling campaigns. But it seems that not every corner of Jamie Oliver’s empire is singing from the chef’s sustainability songsheet, after it was revealed that one of his restaurants has been fined for breaking recycling rules. For two years Jamie’s Italian neglected to recycle its packaging waste, the Environment Agency said, and the firm has been asked to pay a penalty in the form of a £6,000 donation to an environmental charity. It was the second embarrassment in a matter of weeks for the TV chef’s empire. Last month it was disclosed that his upmarket butcher’s shop in the City of London had to close temporarily after inspectors found mouse droppings and mouldy carcasses. Jamie’s Italian fell out with the state waste regulator following the chain’s rapid expansion three years ago. Its managers, the Environment Agency said, ignored their responsibilities to recover and recycling packaging waste under 2007 regulations. A spokesman for the Environment Agency said the company ‘had failed to register with a packaging waste recovery scheme for two years, and failed to take reasonable steps to recover and recycle packaging waste.’ She added: ‘Jamie’s Italian Ltd was . not complying with packaging waste regulations, however the company has . since changed the way it operates and volunteered a financial . contribution of £5,904 to the Young People’s Trust for the Environment. Breaking the rules: For two years Jamie's Italian neglected to recycle its packaging waste, the Environment Agency said, and the firm has been asked to pay a penalty in the form of a £6,000 donation to a charity . ‘Civil sanctions such as these are a proportionate and cost-effective way for . businesses to make amends for less serious environmental offences.’ The . ‘enforcement undertaking for environment offences’ was accepted by the . Agency between February and May this year, the Agency said in its notice . published yesterday. Jamie . Oliver’s restaurant interests have expanded in recent years, at the same . time as he has used his celebrity to campaign for better food for . schoolchildren and encourage employment of youngsters in the food . industry. Environmental . concerns have been prominent among his interests. His austerity . cookbook, which advises people on how to avoid waste, has been promoted . by the Government-funded Love Food Hate Waste campaign, and restaurants . underline their commitment to recycling. One . recently-established American-themed Oliver restaurant in London . promised that its manager would ‘use his expertise to recycle, re-use . and upcycle large quantities’ of uneaten food. Mr Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant in Cornwall proclaims that staying in business ‘means being sustainable. Closed for a day: Barbecoa, his upmarket butcher's shop in London, had to close temporarily in January after inspectors found mouse droppings and mouldy carcasses. Chefs Mr Oliver and Adam Perry are pictured there . 'Across the board. We focus on sustainability in all areas from energy usage, recycling, sourcing and conservation.’ The . chef has praised fast food chain McDonald’s because ‘recycling is being . improved and improved’, and in 2012, one of its managers told a . newspaper that it was adopting Tetra Pak wine supplies, intended for . easier recycling, because the system was ‘eco-friendly’.

"By . Sam Webb . Channel 4 faced fresh complaints about its controversial Bear Grylls survival series after it featured two contestants being administered painful enemas. Viewers said the show made them 'feel sick' and 'gag', in the latest backlash to hit The Island. It has already faced accusations that part of the show had been staged along with accusations that those taking part in the reality show had taken part in similar survival challenges and were not ‘ordinary men’. Scroll down for video . Viewers said the survival reality TV programmeThe Island, fronted by Bear Grylls, made them 'feel sick' and 'gag', when contestants were shown having an enema . The contestants on The Island, which is already under fire over claims some if the scenes were faked . The latest wave of complaints mainly centred on Channel 4’s decision to broadcast an enema being administered by a doctor to two islanders suffering from bowel problems. The doctor used a washed-up rubber tube and a cut off water bottle to carry out the procedure which caused outrage. Sammyjane tweeted: 'Cringing so much, this guy just sticks a pipe up on his ass on ""The Island with Bear Grylls"" absolutely disgusting.' Samxahemed complained: 'The Island with Bear Grylls has made me gag and feel sick at the same time.' Channel 4 received a number of complaints about last night’s show, which was aired at 9pm, but would not say how many or the nature of the complaint. Media regulator Ofcom also recevied a complaint about 'a fish being killed in an inhumane way'. It has transpired that two caimans - a species of crocodile - were let loose for the group to catch in one programme . Ofcom said it had yet to decide whether to open a formal investigation into last night’s show as to whether it breached its broadcasting code. The charge against the last night’s episode of being 'inhumane' was also levelled on Twitter, with Emily Manning tweeting 'Bear Grylls is inhumane'. An earlier episode of The Island with Bear Grylls - which featured a cayman killed for food - prompted 93 complaints to Ofcom. Despite the flurry of complaints, Ofcom opted not to investigate the episode as it 'could be justified by contextual factors'. Channel 4 said it had received 'very few' complaints about last night’s show. Kiff McManus has ten years¿ experience working in hostile conditions . Last month TV adventurer Bear Grylls and Channel 4 found themselves embroiled in a fakery row over The Island after it emerged that several of the contestants are professionals used to thriving in extreme conditions – and some of the scenes have been staged. In the opening episode, the dehydrated camp-mates were seen running out of time to find a source of fresh drinking water. When they eventually located one, viewers were not told that the murky supply was in fact a rubber-lined pool put there by the production crew. It has also transpired that two caimans – a species of crocodile – were let loose for the group to catch. This was not disclosed in the broadcast. Four of the 13 men other men have experience of surviving extreme conditions and some have previously worked with Grylls. Rupert Smith worked with him on Channel 4’s Escape To The Legion and cameraman Dan Etheridge worked with Grylls on Man vs Wild. Sound recordist Kiff McManus has ten years’ experience working in hostile conditions, while Matt Bennett was part of the team behind Sky’s Ross Kemp On Gangs. Channel 4 said in a statement:  ‘It clearly states in the programme voiceover that trained crew are part of the experiment, living under exactly the same conditions as the other men.'","Viewers said graphic scenes in hit show The Island made them gag .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Rolf Harris' 90-year-old brother today insisted that his younger sibling would 'never' have groped a make-up artist more than 20 times in a day. Speaking to Southwark Crown Court via videolink from Sydney, Bruce Harris dismissed claims that Rolf had put his hands up a make-up artist's shorts as 'ridiculous', saying he would have shouted at his younger brother if he'd seen him do such a thing. Bruce Harris, who became the artist and musician’s manager in 1981, dismissed the claims of a supporting witness who said Rolf Harris groped her as she did his make up for a television programme in Australia in the mid-1980s. Scroll down for video . The idea that Rolf Harris repeatedly groped a make-up artist is 'ridiculous', his older brother Bruce, right, said. The 90-year-old, who became Rolf's manager, addressed Southwark Crown Court via video link from Sydney . The woman's testimony is not on the charge sheet because of where and when the alleged incident took place, but she was called as a supporting witness by the prosecution. Rolf Harris, 84, of Bray, Berkshire, is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four women between 1968 and 1986, all of which he denies. Today, his brother told jurors that he accompanied him to a television studio in Australia where the incident was alleged to have taken place, and said of the woman's claims: 'That's ridiculous.  He would never do that and I wouldn't let him do that, and he knew I wouldn't let him do that. 'That's just not possible.' The freelancer, who was in her 20s at the time, said he repeatedly put his hands inside her baggy shorts as far as her hips while making a programme in Australia in the mid-1980s. But Bruce Harris said: 'I would . have shouted at him, I would have demanded that he stopped. But it never . happened, it would never have been something that he would have done. 'I would have taken the elder brother approach to a younger brother misbehaving.' The former advertising boss said he had never seen Rolf behaving inappropriately towards anyone. ‘I’ve never had any problems with that at all,’ he told the jury.  'I’ve never seen him do anything unpleasant to anybody really. Rolf Harris arrived at court today accompanied by his daughter, Bindi Harris, left, and niece, Jenny Harris, right . ‘Certainly I watched him perform with children - he . and I had started a series of programmes over the years called School . Special, where there were literally hundreds and hundreds of children. ‘He worked with them and was always very likeable and helpful in helping the children to perform. ‘Never did he do anything to cause any problems.’ One . alleged victim, Tonya Lee, who has waived her right to anonymity, . claimed Harris touched her intimately when she met him while touring . Britain with an Australian youth theatre group. Count 1: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on girl aged 15 . Count 2: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 3: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 4: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 5: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 6: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 7: Indecent assault between 1/1/84 and 1/1/85 on same girl, then aged 19 . Count 8: Indecent assault on 31/5/86 on second girl, aged 14 . Count 9: Indecent assault on same girl, 14 . Count 10: Indecent assault on 31/5/86 on same girl, 14 . Count 11: Indecent assault between 1/1/68 and 1/1/70 on third girl, aged 7-8 . Count 12: Indecent assault on fourth girl, 14, between 1/1/75 and 1/1/76 . The former television presenter denies all the counts . Bruce Harris said the first he knew about the allegations against his brother was when Ms Lee gave a television interview about her claims last year. He said he called the theatre group's artistic director, Kathy Henkel, to ask her whether she had seen what allegedly happened. 'In retrospect I kept on niggling away at her, saying ""Surely you must have seen something"",' he said. 'In Tonya’s documentary she went into great detail about what happened over a period of time, and I thought that Kathy must have seen something of this. So I kept trying to see. I didn’t put any pressure on her.' He went on: 'I wasn’t trying to get her to change her story, if that’s what you mean, I was trying to see whether she could back up what this girl was saying.' Under cross-examination by prosecutor Sasha Wass QC, he admitted that in the 'hypothetical' situation that Ms Henkel had supported the claims, he would not have told the police. He said: 'I’m protective of my brother and I also wanted to see if there was any truth to what was being said. I didn’t believe it.' The jury has already heard that Ms Henkel could not be certain about what happened on the night of the alleged assault, and that speaking to Bruce she claimed she 'felt pressured to say that it couldn’t have taken place'. Bruce Harris repeatedly denied trying to influence her, and said if his brother had performed for the theatre group while they were having dinner together, he would have been most focused on doing his show. 'I can’t believe if he had done a show like that he would have had time or been bothered to do the kind of things that Tonya Lee has said,' he told the court. Later, a retired tour manager who worked with Rolf Harris in the 1980s told the court how the entertainer was always 'quiet and nervous' before he went on stage. Ken Jeacle, who was also speaking from Australia, said: 'Usually Rolf was quiet and rather nervous. 'He didn't appear to eat terribly much prior to a performance - he was quietly was assessing himself in readiness for the audience.' The trial, which was adjourned until tomorrow, continues.

"By . John Hall . A homeless dog that was so hairy he looked like the Star Wars character Chewbacca has undergone a complete makeover in the hope of finding him a new owner. Chewy, a six-year-old Lhasa Apso, arrived at the Blue Cross dog centre in Southampton, Hampshire after his owners' circumstances changed and they were no longer able to look after him. However, thanks to his wildly overgrown coat, Chewy initially struggled to attract an adoptive family - so staff at the centre decided to give him a serious trim in order to make him look more appealing. Cute: Chewy's oddball appearance - including a wildly overgrown coat and prominent under bite which left him resembling the Star Wars character Chewbacca - saw him initially struggle to attract an adoptive family . Uncanny: Chewy was so-named because of his resemblance to Chewbacca - the Star Wars character portrayed by Peter Mayhew (seen here in the film alongside Harrison Ford as Han Solo, right) The makeover worked, and Chewy was adopted within days of having his overgrown coat cut. Laura Boyle, rehoming supervisor at Blue Cross, said: 'Little Chewy was such a hairball when he arrived - he was well overdue for a bit of a trim. 'We got rid of so much hair, he looks almost half the size and I'm sure he's feeling a lot cooler too,' she added. 'He's such a sweet little dog and proved impossible to resist now he's smartened up. We're not surprised he got snapped up by his lucky new owners,' Ms Boyle went on. Makeover: Chewy initially struggled to attract an adoptive family - so staff at the centre decided to give him a serious trim in order to make him look more appealing. He has since found a loving family to adopt him . Chewy is, of course, named after the hairy Star Wars character Chewbacca. Although a sensitive skin condition means he has to stick to a special diet, staff at Blue Cross say he is an otherwise happy and friendly dog who loves going for walks. Lhasa Apsos originate in Tibet and were once used in Buddhist monasteries to alert monks to intruders. As they were traditionally bred for colder climates, the dogs need their long coats groomed regularly in order to avoid looking to Chewy did when he arrived at the centre. Official advice says it is better to trim a Lhasa Apso's fur in summertime to avoid overheating.","Chewy, a six-year-old Lhasa Apso, was taken in by Blue Cross dog centre .

With 640 stickers in the current Panini World Cup sticker album and 50p for a pack of six it should cost just £63.99 to complete the collection. However, allowing for duplicates it is estimated that 899 packs are actually needed at a cost of a whopping £449.50. Costly: New research has shown the real price of completing the World Cup sticker album . Straightforward: Without duplicates and swaps it could be as little as £63.99 to finish the lot . Andrew Palmer from the Economist attempted to explain the workings while taking into consideration his own personal knowledge of collecting. He told BBC Radio Five Live: 'It's a statistical technique called the Coupon Collector's Problem. I won't go into the maths part because I don't understand it but the idea is basically that if you as an individual just bought pack after pack after pack and didn't do any swapping how long would it take you to fill your album. 'Of course the probability of getting the card that you need goes down the more slots that you fill in the album. 'So on average these statisticians from the Swiss university reckon that it is just under 900 packs which in Britain is £450 give or take, which is a horrifyingly large amount.'

"By . Emma Glanfield . It may not look like a big catch, but this tiny fish has broken the record for being the largest tiddler ever caught in British waters. The huge stickleback was hooked by keen angler Craig Birchall, 25, who is celebrating after breaking the record – which he set himself last year. Mr Birchall, a warehouse worker from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, caught the three-spined stickleback - which weighs the same as a £2 coin - in a lake near his home using a tiny piece of worm as bait and the smallest hook he could get his hands on. Big catch: Craig Birchall, 25, is celebrating after breaking the record for catching the biggest tiddler in Britain for the second year running which he caught using a worm as bait . The stickleback fish weighed in at a 12 grams, or just under half an ounce, and measured 2.9 inches in length, breaking the British record set by Mr Birchall in 2013 . He had been fishing for about an hour and reeled in hundreds of miniscule fish before he pulled up the record-breaking specimen. Weighing in at 12 grams, or just under half an ounce, and measuring 2.9 inches in length, the fish smashes the record Mr Birchall set in April 2013. The specimen is three grams heavier than one he caught last year, which was heavy enough to set an official record at 8.8 grams but was never verified. The previous record for a three-spined stickleback was set in 1998 by Dennis Flack in Cambridgeshire. Mr Birchall said he had set out to catch a three-spined stickleback - Gasterosteus aculeatus in Latin - because he feels some of the smaller species are overlooked by anglers. He said: ‘There is a lake in a wooded area near where I live so I went down there to spend an hour or so fishing. ‘Not many people fish for the small species and I think they are underrated, so I decided that I would try and go for them. ‘I set up a small float and a really small, size 26 hook, and I used a tiny piece of worm as bait. The recent catch is three grams heavier than one he caught in April last year (pictured), which was heavy enough to set an official record at 8.8 grams but was never verified . Mr Birchall said he had set out to catch a three-spined stickleback - Gasterosteus aculeatus in Latin - because he feels some of the smaller species are overlooked by anglers. Pictured: His previous record-breaking catch . ‘During the session time I caught about 100 stickleback which were all pretty small, but then I saw the float go under. ‘I knew it was going to be bigger than the rest but when I pulled it up I couldn't believe it. ‘I put it on some kitchen scales and it weighed six drams, which is 12 grams. It was also over two inches in length. ‘Last year I broke the British record with a five dram fish so I was really excited because this one was even bigger than that.’ Mr . Birchall’s latest catch was witnessed by his mother Catherine, who took . a photograph of the fish next to his hands for scale before he threw it . back into the water alive and well.

Thank God he was in a modern race car with a safety tested . carbon fibre tub, or I really don’t think he would be with us now. Great escape: Racing driver Wallace Menzies walked away from this mangled wreck with just bruises and a broken cheekbone after he flipped his car twice in a 120mph crash and landed sideways in a ditch . Loss of control: Menzies, 42, was competing in the century-old Shelsey Walsh hillclimb race in Worcestershire when he lost control of his DJ Firestorm car on a bend . Drama: Mr Menzie's car had careed off the closed public road yesterday and struck a verge to driver's right . 'My . son was watching the speed trap they have just before the corner and . reading out the speeds and the car before him was doing 136mph. 'I . think he must have been doing 125mph at least when he left the road. He . just lost control and hit the bank, that sent the car into the air and . he just somersaulted down the road. 'When he came to a rest the marshals were there straight away, but it still took an age to get him out. 'We . all held our breath I think, and when they eventually got him out and . he put a thumb up above the blankets everyone was so relieved. Force: The car was sent flying through the air and flipped twice before ploughing into the side of the hillside . Action: Mr Menzies, who currently sits fifth in the British Hillclimb Championship, had been racing at the historic event, which has been run since 1905 . 'I just happened to have my shutter open when the crash happened.' Mr . Menzies, who currently sits fifth in the British Hillclimb . Championship, had been racing at the historic Shelsley Walsh event. The . race, which snakes 1000 yards up a Worcestershire hillside, is the . oldest hillclimb event in the world having run continuously since 1905. Help: Mr Menzies was left precariously balanced in the wreck of his hillclimb car for more than 45 minutes as race marshalls and medics battled to free him and take him to hospital . Injury: The driver was taken to hospital but was discharged just a few hours later having suffered a broken cheek bone, cuts to his face and bruised shoulders . High speed: Spectators estimated that Mr Menzies was driving at around 125mph when he left the road . Specially-tuned cars speed up the steep course hitting speeds of up to 140mph just inches from trees and steep drops. Recovery: Mr Menzies's wife Nicola said that her husband had left hospital on Sunday night . Yesterday Mr Menzies's wife Nicola told hillclimb racers via an online forum for that her husband had left hospital on Sunday night. And she said the couple were now making their way back to their home in Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland, to prepare for Wallace’s next race in the Scottish village of Doune. 'We left the hospital in the early hours of this morning,' Mrs Menzies wrote. 'Wallace is okay apart from a broken cheek bone, facial cut and bruising to his face and shoulders.' 'Could have been a lot worse.' She added: 'I am sure he’ll make a speedy recovery and will be ready for Doune. 'A huge thanks to the rescue crew, marshals and everyone who helped or offered help, greatly appreciated.' A spokesman for the Midland Automobile Club, which runs the hillclimb, said: 'Following Wallace Menzies accident on Sunday we are pleased to report he was released from hospital in the early hours of the morning. 'He had four stitches, a cracked cheekbone and bruising but was in good spirits saying he felt like he had been in a rough game of rugby and asking for his money back. 'He would like to thank the marshals and medics for their swift actions and hopes to be back on the track for the next round at Doune.'","Wallace Menzies was competing in hillclimb race when he lost control of car .

"By . Chris Foy . Follow @@FoyChris . In the exceptionally difficult and frustrating circumstances, England’s coaches have put together a side that, in most areas, has enough quality to challenge the All Blacks. Stuart Lancaster and his assistants have had to choose from a significantly diluted pool of available players, given the enforced absence of more than a dozen leading men, including five Lions. Yet, the line-up they have selected to play at Eden Park reflects the enhanced depth at their disposal in the majority of positions. There’s no Alex Corbisiero at loosehead prop, but Joe Marler is a powerful deputy who has had a fine season. Dan Cole is not on tour, but David Wilson filled in at tighthead with distinction during the Six Nations. In the second row, Courtney Lawes will be hugely missed but Geoff Parling – who started in Sydney when the Lions won their series against Australia last summer – is a reliable figure to fill the void and run the lineout with supreme expertise. Big test: Freddie Burns was an outside candidate but injuries have helped the fly half back into the team . In the back row, England are without Tom Wood and Billy Vunipola, but Ben Morgan is a recent starter at No 8 and a potent ball-carrier, while James Haskell deserves his opportunity at blindside on the strength of Test-class form in the latter part of the club season. The flanker has been the man for a crisis before – producing a stunning defensive performance when the shattered and depleted national team held firm to draw with the Springboks in Port Elizabeth two years ago. The management will desperately hope that Danny Care overcomes his shoulder problem to start this series opener, as he was the high-octane catalyst for so much of their best attacking work during the Six Nations. Ben Youngs is an experienced replacement if necessary, but he does not have the momentum of prime form from the domestic campaign to take into the match. Manu Tuilagi will provide a marauding threat to the All Blacks from outside centre – as he has done in the past – while Mike Brown is capable of carving up the home defence in keeping with recent heroics. Lancaster will also be happy enough with his wing combination of Marland Yarde and Jonny May. The primary problems lie at hooker and in the 10-12 area. Rob Webber will be expected to hit the ground running in the No 2 shirt, despite not playing for a month due to a knee injury. Dylan Hartley is poised to return in Dunedin next week, so Webber must somehow deliver similar physicality, nous and lineout-throwing precision before making way for the first-choice man in that position. Plunged into action: Ben Youngs could play at scrum half if Care fails to make the cut . Brown, Yarde, Tuilagi, Eastmond, May, Burns, Care, Marler, Webber, Wilson, Launchbury, Parling, Haskell, Morgan, Robshaw . England are pitching Freddie Burns in at fly half in a selection based on reputation rather than form. His game collapsed during the season amid rumours about his move to Leicester from Gloucester and there is precious little evidence yet that he has regained sufficient conviction to run the show with authority. But, with Owen Farrell and Stephen Myler not able to play due to jet-lag protocols and George Ford recovering at home after shoulder surgery, Lancaster and Co have erred on the side of familiarity by preferring Burns to Danny Cipriani. Now they must hold their breath and hope. It is a similar scenario at inside centre, where England are temporarily without Billy Twelvetrees, Brad Barritt and Luther Burrell – who plays at No 12 for Northampton – so Kyle Eastmond is the last man standing. He was superb in Argentina last summer but sending him out to face the world champions in a stadium where they haven’t lost for 20 years is a high-stakes way of assessing whether he has the big-game attributes to cut it at Test level. So much will depend on how Burns and Eastmond acquit themselves in defence. The doomsday scenario involves Ma’a Nonu repeatedly hurtling through flimsy tackles in that area and igniting All Black attacks in open space. The optimistic outlook is that a strong England pack dominate possession and Burns gives the tourists territorial advantage. Yet, even if that vision is achieved, New Zealand have more potency to summon from the bench, so if they haven’t taken control by the hour mark, they surely will in the final quarter.

"By . Dave Wood . Former England defender Danny Mills said Wednesday's draw with Ecuador showed why Roy Hodgson needed John Terry at the World Cup. The Chelsea defender is likely to be in Brazil as a pundit for ITV after retiring from international football in 2012 in the aftermath of the Anton Ferdinand race row. Experience: Dany Mills says England could do with John Terry in Brazil . Hodgson resisted calls for him to try and entice Terry back into the England fold and that decision could backfire with a shortage of defensive options. 'John Terry doesn't look like a bad option now,’ Mills told BBC 5Live after England's 2-2 draw. 'Roy Hodgson is likely to say 'it was an experimental side, he was pleased with a few things and unhappy with a few things and we move on to the next game'.' Struggle: England defender Chris Smalling was at fault for Ecuador's first goal . Phil Jones and Chris Smalling struggled in the heart of defence, while using James Milner at right back was exposed by Ecuador’s left winger Jefferson Montero. Rickie Lambert, Ross Barkley and Alex Oxlaide-Chamberlain, before he went off injured, all took the chance to press their claims for a starting place. Mills added: 'One or two players did okay. We have shown when England give the ball away, it is not good enough, we are not organised enough. You have to be ready to defend. I am not sure enough of the England players are aware of that. Impressive: Ross Barkley took the chance to stake his claim for a starting role at World Cup finals . 'Ecuador have aspirations of getting out of their World Cup group with France, Honduras and Switzerland. There is no real favourite to get out of that group but they have shown they are a decent side here.' Mills said England's Raheem Sterling was unfortunate to be sent off following a late clash with Antonio Valencia. He said: . It was a rash challenge by Sterling. He . dived in, didn't get the ball. The ref could possibly have booked him. Then Valencia pushes him in the head, went to grab his throat but . changed his mind. A red card for both is unnecessary.

"By . Carl Markham, Press Association . Everton striker Arouna Kone admits he has to prove his worth next season after missing seven months of his maiden campaign through injury. The Ivory Coast international sustained a knee injury in October which prevented him from playing again, meaning he managed just six appearances without a goal after his £6million move from Wigan last summer. Kone is to forego a lengthy summer holiday to ensure he is back to full fitness by the time pre-season comes around.

And unfortunately for him in his absence the team played the sort of football he thinks will benefit his style of play.

Petkovic lost in qualifying last year as she battled her way back from a succession of injuries and thought about quitting the sport. The 26-year-old was a three-time slam quarter-finalist in 2011 and bettered that with a 6-2 6-2 victory over Errani, who lost in the final to Maria Sharapova two years ago. Progress: Andrea Petkovic eased past Sara Errani to earn a place in her first ever semi-final of a Grand Slam . Play began almost three hours late because of rain, and it was not long before the bad weather returned, but this time they played on. The rain seemed to unsettle Errani, who had started the better by winning the first two games but then lost six in a row as Petkovic stormed to the first set. The German, ranked 27, was particularly enjoying pummelling Errani's soft serves, her backhand doing most of the damage.

"By . Duncan Bech . Jonny May has issued a defiant response to the perception in New Zealand that England will be lambs to the slaughter by declaring: ‘We are not a rubbish team.’ Stuart Lancaster’s tourists have been installed as 16/1 underdogs by local bookmakers for Saturday’s first Test in Auckland, with an expectant public eager to toast a resounding All Blacks victory. The statistics make for frightening reading. New Zealand are chasing a 15th successive victory, have won every match at Eden Park since 1994 and have lost just once since lifting the World Cup in 2011. Defiant response: Jonny May insists New Zealand should give England respect ahead of the first Test . In contrast, England are hamstrung here by the absence of key players from Aviva Premiership finalists Northampton and Saracens, and an injury list that has accounted for four British and  Irish Lions. It is against this backdrop that the tourists are being billed as victims in waiting, but May insists Saturday’s outcome is no foregone conclusion. ‘We have nothing to lose but at the same time we have great players in our team,’ said the Gloucester wing. ‘We are going forward as a team. We are not a rubbish team, we have good principles, we have good structures and everyone is buying into that. We are a tough outfit to play against for anyone, irrespective of the new players that have come in, because of the culture we have created as a team and the way we play. It is easy for players to jump into it. ‘We are underdogs for this game. People have written us off but that’s not an excuse. We put pressure on ourselves, we want a performance and we will go out there and give it everything.' England experienced mixed  fortunes on Tuesday with the news influential All Black Kieran Read will miss the first Test due to concussion being offset by Billy Twelvetrees’ absence from training once again. The loss of No 8 Read, the International Rugby Board’s player of the year, will be keenly felt while a doubt hangs over prolific All Black wing Julian Savea, who is struggling with a knee injury. Ruled out: Kieran Read (left) will miss Saturday's first Test with England after suffering with concussion . England have been gifted their team talk for Saturday’s first Test after blundering All Black Brodie Retallick failed to correctly name a member of Stuart Lancaster’s squad. Asked if he knew any of the tourists, Retallick responded ‘a couple’. When pressed for a name, the second row said ‘Michael Lawes’. Retallick was referring to Courtney Lawes, who is unavailable. England will find the gaffe galling as Retallick was in the All Blacks side that lost 38-21 atTwickenham in 2012. England’s plans have been disrupted yet again with Twelvetrees’ inability to take part in the final  session before Lancaster names his team tomorrow night. The 25-year-old from Gloucester, who has been sidelined since May 3 because of an ankle problem, is set to be replaced by Bath’s Kyle Eastmond. Of some comfort to Lancaster is the good health of May, whose enthusiastic running in the RBS 6 Nations ensures he will continue on the left wing when England’s schedule resumes on Saturday. May is yet to cross the try-line in internationals but understands the reasons for that. ‘During the 6 Nations I learnt Test rugby is a big mental jump - the pressure, accuracy and intensity are higher, but I thought I came out of it a better player,’ he said. ‘We weren’t great at Gloucester at the end of the season but I went away and worked on things and I feel more confident in myself. ‘In the 6 Nations I noticed a couple of times I could have backed myself a little bit more on the outside. That’s a confidence thing, being involved in that for the first time. I have gone back to club level and worked on that. ‘It was frustrating coming off the pitch thinking, “I could have gone for it then”.

The club already have a list of pre-identified targets, which include Swansea left back Ben Davies and Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi, who plays for Standard Liege. But Pochettino will be keen to stamp his own mark on the club's recruitment policy this summer; starting in Brazil later this month. Baldini led a mass transfer drive last year which saw the club spend in-excess of £100million on fresh talent - though that was mostly funded by Gareth Bale's £85million move to Real Madrid. Tottenham's spending will not be as excessive this summer, though Pochettino will still be given a healthy budget to strengthen his squad ahead of his first season in charge.

"By . Kieran Gill . Kimi Raikkonen can offer no excuses for his poor start as Ferrari technical director James Allison says it's simply because he's driving 'slower than Fernando (Alonso) at the moment'. The anticipated duel with Alonso has failed to materialise with the Spaniard out-qualifying Raikkonen in four of the six races and, crucially, finishing ahead in every grand prix. Raikkonen is languishing in 12th place while Alonso is the best of the rest when it comes to drivers' standings, third only to runaway Mercedes pair Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton. Slow start: Kimi Raikkonen (pictured) has failed to ignite a duel with Ferrari team-mate Fernando Alonso . Losing battle: Raikkonen was out-qualified in four of six races by Alonso and sits 12th in the drivers' standings . Speed: Raikkonen has been urged to up his game by Ferrari technical director James Allison . In terms of points, Alonso has amassed 61 compared to Raikkonen's less-than-impressive 17. Alonso is in his fifth season with Ferrari and has full knowledge of how the team works, while Raikkonen is only in the first year of his return to the Maranello marque. The cars, however, were a clean slate given the radical regulations. But Raikkonen seems to not have adapted to the changes as naturally as Alonso. 'I'm not sure it's entirely fair to say he is struggling more than Fernando,' said Allison in assessing Raikkonen's form to date ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal. 'They both have similar feedback with the car, and there are aspects of this year's rules that make the cars across the pit-lane a far from easy aspect for the driver. 'There is a lot more torque from the engine, a lot less aerodynamic grip, and the tyres are deliberately less aggressive than last year. 'All that means they are quite a handful to drive, not too breezy for anyone, be that at the front or back of the grid. 'The . problems Kimi has with the car under braking, downshifting, are the . same as Fernando, and pretty much the same as being experienced by other . drivers at other teams. 'He's just going a little slower than Fernando at the moment, but that gap is closing as the year progresses.' No contest: Alonso has adapted to the radical changes more naturally than his Ferrari team-mate . Looking down: Raikkonen has a mere 17 points compared to Alonso's 61 in the drivers' standings . Ferrari expected to be in the hunt for this year's championships, only for Mercedes to outclass them after the rules overhaul. It is Allison's first full season as technical director after leaving Lotus a year ago, and he recognises the sizable task. 'It's tough. Making a car quick that wasn't quick in the first race is a particularly challenging task,' added Allison. 'It's very difficult to produce a rate of improvement substantially different to the people we are fighting with. 'However, we've had a race or two where the pieces we took to the track were useful, but not big steps forward. 'We hope in the coming races to have a more steady progression of things we hope will lift us up in our competitiveness. 'But we won't know for sure until we get there because it depends on what everyone else does. 'I don't think we can claim to have produced a chassis that is, at the moment, the equal of either the Mercedes or the Red Bull. 'We're not lagging hugely behind, but there is work for us to do before we can hold our hands up and say we are completely happy with the chassis performance.' View: Raikkonen ended in 12th in the Monaco F1 Grand Prix, while Alonso finished a more respectable fourth .","Ferrari technical director James Allison admits Kimi Raikkonen is 'going a little slower than Fernando (Alonso) at the moment'

"By . Gene Cherry . The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will not appeal banned American sprinter Tyson Gay’s controversial one-year doping ban, it said on Tuesday. The global agency said the ban, which has been widely criticised in Europe as too lenient, was 'compatible with the World Anti-Doping Code.' Gay, the world’s joint second fastest man, last month had accepted the one-year suspension by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) after a 2013 positive test for an anabolic steroid. Dope: US sprinter Tyson Gay received a one-year ban after testing positive for anabolic steroids in 2013 . The ban was backdated to June 23, 2013, making the U.S. 100 metres record holder eligible to return to running later this month. His first race will be a 100 metres at Lausanne’s Diamond League meeting on July 3, organisers said on Monday. Normally athletes receive a two-year suspension for their first major doping offense but under anti-doping rules the ban can be reduced for substantial cooperation. The U.S. agency said Gay was eligible for such a reduction because the sprinter offered what it termed substantial assistance in his case. On Tuesday, WADA said it was satisfied with the decision. Tyson Gay has returned the silver medal he won at London 2012 . 'After careful review and scrutiny of the full case file, WADA is satisfied that Mr. Tyson Gay provided substantial assistance to USADA in an appropriate fashion,' the global agency said in a statement to Reuters. 'WADA will therefore not appeal USADA’s decision which is compatible with the World Anti-Doping Code.' Officials of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), which also can appeal the U.S. decision, declined comment, saying the matter remains in the hands of its doping review board to assess. IAAF president Lamine Diack, however, told Reuters last month he supported the World Anti-Doping Code rule that allows athletes to receive reduced sentences if they provide substantial assistance to anti-doping agencies. 'In the fight against doping we have to use this,' Diack said in an interview at the inaugural IAAF World Relays in the Bahamas. 'If someone gave really very good cooperation and give us the possibility to do more to fight doping, we have to do something.' In addition to the ban, Gay has returned the silver medal he won as a member of the U.S. 4x100 metres relay team at the 2012 London Olympics. His former coach Jon Drummond has filed a defamation lawsuit against the sprinter, USADA and USADA chief Travis Tygart, claiming Drummond was falsely accused of supplying Gay with performance-enhancing drugs.","WADA have confirmed they will not appeal Tyson Gay's doping ban .

Matfield, who has won 110 caps, will take the helm for Saturday's appointment with a World XV in Cape Town. 'Victor's appointment as interim captain is something I thought long and hard about, and it wasn't an easy decision to make,' Springboks coach Heyneke Meyer told South African rugby's official website. 'The three candidates we considered - Victor, Bismarck du Plessis and Fourie du Preez - were all very strong options. 'It's only a short-term appointment as Jean will take over as captain again once he's recovered from his injury. 'Victor was a logical option. He knows the pressure associated with being Springbok captain, as he's been there before, and he has vast captaincy experience at all levels of the game.'

"By . Daniel Mills . Disgraced AFL star Josh Bootsma, 21, propositioned a young fan for sex on social media within 15 minutes of the pair connecting, the Herald Sun has reported. The damning allegations against the 21-year-old also include claims he sent explicit images, constantly invited her to his house and reassured her he was single even though his girlfriend was heavily pregnant. On Tuesday, Carlton sacked the up and coming Blues player after a mother of a teenage girl came forward with images the 21-year-old had been sending to her daughter's friend. Scroll down for video . Carlton Blues player Josh Bootsma has been sacked from the club for sending explicit photos on SnapChat . - Josh Bootsma to young fan . Adults who send sexually explicit messages to anyone aged 16 or under can face criminal charges, and in Bootsma's case, police have not ruled out investigating. In the wash up since the player's sacking, The Herald Sun has claimed to have seen five months worth of social media activity between Bootsma and the women he allegedly sent lurid and explicit material to. In one case, it has been reported that Bootsma groomed at least one Carlton fan before asking her for sex. He allegedly sent to the fan: 'I think you are a sexy girl who deserves to be treated like a princess.' In another, he asks the fan if she is 'up for a sex session on Tuesday.' One image viewed by The Herald Sun also appears to show Bootsma pictured in the bath from the waist down asking the intended recipient to 'join' him. While Josh Bootsma is in hot water after reportedly sending inappropriate images to a teenager, his girlfriend Kyla is due to give birth any day . A 23-year-old woman has spoken to the Sun Herald on anonymity, claiming Bootsma added her on Facebook after she started following him and other Carlton Blues supporters on Instagram. It is alleged their communication started as early as August last year, and continued until November only to end when Bootsma's girlfriend became aware of his online activities. The pair met in person at an open training day last year and he started sending her messages on social media platform, Kik, the next day. She said she wasn't fooled by Bootsma's attempt to court her into having sex. 'I caught on pretty quickly what he was about,' she said. Carlton terminated the 21-year-old's contract on Tuesday, saying the player had been repeatedly counseled and warned for his inappropriate behaviour. This is not the first time Bootsma has been in breach of the club code, and when Carlton football manager Andrew McKay addressed the media on Tuesday he said Bootsma had been known to arrive late to training and skip appointments. 'That was the final straw that broke the camels back for us to decide to terminate his contract,' Mr McKay said. When asked about the nature of the inappropriate content, Mr McKay said he didn't believe it was necessary to go into the details. 'The point is he's put something on social media that's highly inappropriate, and it really does not meet the standards of the football club.' The football manager also said that the club had tried to help Bootsma by offering him support and welfare but he had continued to let the side down. 'The Carlton Football Club has high expectations of its players and staff; we expect them to uphold certain standards,' he said. In a statement Carlton said the defender had been offered counseling and welfare but had not met the club's behaviour standards, according to the Herald Sun. Bootsma had a contract with the club until the end of 2015, and is currently coming to an agreement with Carlton in regards to it, with The Age reporting that he will not be paid out. He hasn't taken to the field for the club this year, and his last game was played in round 21 of 2013.","Carlton Player Josh Bootsma could be investigated by police .

"By . Kate Lyons . Malcom Turnbull and Alan Jones exchanged fiery words on radio this morning, when the broadcaster told the federal communications minister that he had 'no hope ever' of becoming the leader of the Liberal Party. Mr Turnbull and Mr Jones were involved in a heated exchange, which resulted in the minister telling the radio personality that he was a 'bomb thrower' who could dish it out but couldn't take it. The interview started by Mr Jones telling Mr Turnbull to 'say after me' that he supported the controversial budget, announced last month. Scroll down for video . 'I am not going to take dictation from you': Alan Jones started his interview by trying to make Malcolm Turnbull repeat after him that he supported the government's budget . The controversial radio host told the federal communications minister that he was causing problems in the Liberal Party by meeting with Clive Palmer . 'Alan, I am not going to take dictation from you, I am a cabinet minister,' said Mr Turnbull. Though Mr Turnbull went on to say that he 'unreservedly' supported the budget. AJ: Malcolm, I've coached Australia in rugby. If one of my players on the eve of the rugby test was seen socialising, having dinner, privately inviting a member of the All Blacks, on the eve of a test match, the player would be sent home, Malcolm. MT: Well, this is not football. We are not playing football.MT: Yourself, Andrew Bolt in particular, have set out to suggest there is dissension in the government, that there are challenges to his leadership – . AJ: No there's no challenge to his leadership… precisely because you have no hope, ever, of being the leader. You've got to get that into your head. No hope ever. But because of that you're happy to chuck a few bombs around to blow up Abbott a bit, that's what they're saying. MT:  This is the most united, cohesive government we've had in this country for a long time and I think it's just very sad that you and Bolt are doing the work of the Labor Party in undermining the Abbott government. AJ: Oh, so we're the bomb throwers? MT: You are, Alan, you are. AJ: I see. MT: Let's assume [Palmer] is standing in the way of our budget repair… Do you think the best way to get him out of the way, Alan, is to abuse him in the sort of language you're abusing me with? AJ: I'm not abusing you. MT: [laughs] Oh really? I don't think any of your listeners would be under that misapprehension. AJ: You've got a few sensitive nerves there Malcolm! MT: Alan, the problem with you is that you like dishing it out but you don't like taking it. Mr Jones then turned the conversation to Liberal leadership speculation. Rumours have intensified this week that Mr Turnbull, who lost the leadership of the Liberal Party to Tony Abbott in 2009, might be making a tilt for the top job after he ate dinner with Clive Palmer and was vocally supportive of the ABC. 'You have no hope ever of being the leader, you have got to get that into your head,' said Mr Jones.  dd . 'No hope ever. But because of that you're happy to chuck a few bombs around that might blow up Abbott a bit. That's what they're saying.' Mr Turnbull responded by saying he was 'distressed' that conservative commentators such as Mr Jones and Andrew Bolt had suggested there was division in the Liberal Party and that he and Prime Minister Tony Abbott were a team. This is the second stoush Mr Turnbull has engaged in with conservative press this week. Earlier in the week he responded heatedly to an article from Andrew Bolt, which accused Mr Turnbull of trying to destabilise Tony Abbott in a bid to become leader of the party. Mr Turnbull's frontbench colleagues have come to his defence. In response to a question in parliament after Bolt's column was published, about whether Mr Abbott would support his 'friend' Andrew Bolt or his 'frenemy' Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott replied: 'In any dispute between a member of my frontbench and a member of the fourth estate I am firmly on the side of my frontbencher.' Treasurer Joe Hockey defended Mr Turnbull on Thursday after the interview with Alan Jones. 'Malcolm is putting in a huge effort as we all are in endeavouring to focus on the policies of the budget rather than the politics,' Mr Hockey told Sky News. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said he believed Mr Turnbull doth protest too much', and there was clearly division in the Liberal Party.

Scroll down for video . Jamie Gao's (left) girlfriend Misaki Takebayashi (kissing Jamie right) has left Australia to be with family at home in Japan . She also released a heart-shaped note into the waves, and paid tribute to her slain lover on social media alongside a photo of a pendant with a photo of her and Mr Gao inside. The couple had been dating for 'a few months' but Gao had apparently been smitten with his girlfriend for some time before they became a couple. Last week Mr Gao's girlfriend told MailOnline she was struggling to cope with the news. She declined to comment in detail, saying it was a 'very hard time' for her. An intimate memorial service was held in Canterbury in Sydney's south-west at the weekend for the 20-year-old. Police allege Mr Gao was murdered on Tuesday May 20 after a high-stakes drug deal went wrong. Ms Takebayashi threw flowers into the water and released a heart-shaped note into the waves where her boyfriend's body was discovered . They say he was wading 'in over his head', and the afternoon ended with the university student being shot twice in the chest, his body wrapped in a blue tarpaulin before being dumped into the ocean off Cronulla. A body found floating off Shelly Beach a week later was formally identified as the 20-year-old student. Mr Gao was reportedly in 'secret talks with police' in the weeks before he was killed, and had allegedly been called to give evidence before the Australian Crime Commission, the country's peak intelligence-gathering agency. Two former police officers have been charged over the murder of UTS business student Jamie Gao . Federal police have publicly denied claims that the UTS Business student, who is thought to have been caught up in a Hong Kong-based Asian organised crime group, was acting as an informant when he delivered $3 million of methamphetamine to former detectives Roger Rogerson and Glen McNamara. Police have alleged that before he was killed last month, he got inside a car with McNamara and Rogerson and was driven to a storage unit nearby. Police claim Mr Gao was killed for his bag's contents just before 2.30pm. Both McNamara and Rogerson were charged over the student's murder, refused bail, and are due to return to court in July.

"By . Sarah Michael . Fugitive Rodney Clavell was found dead after going on the run from police for 14 days . Fugitive Rodney Clavell has been found dead inside the brothel where he had been hiding out in Adelaide's CBD. South Australian Police Minister Tony Piccolo told state parliament that police discovered Clavell's body following a 12-hour siege. Police Assistant Commissioner Paul Dickson said police located Mr Clavell deceased at about 1.40pm, after deploying a robot to search the premises at about 12.55pm. 'That robot took some time to search the premises but was able to locate Mr Clavell in a position which we believed he was deceased,' he said. Police located a firearm near Clavell on the first story of the building. The matter has been determined to be a death in custody and an investigation and file will now be prepared for the coroner. Clavell had been on the run from police for two weeks in relation to firearms offences. In that time police believe he committed multiple other serious offences. 'On the 25th of May we believe he was involved in an incident in Elizabeth Park where a female was assaulted by Mr Clavell and Mr Clavell had a shotgun,' Mr Dickson said. Scroll down for video . Women walk with their hands up after they were freed from the Adelaide building where Clavell was holed up . One of the women was so distressed she collapsed to the group and had to be assisted by police . Earlier on Thursday four women were released from the building where the 46-year-old was involved in a standoff with police for more than 12 hours. The women walked out of the building on King William Street in Adelaide at around 11.30am with their arms in the air, and were whisked away by STAR Group police. Mr Dickson could not confirm if Clavell had been at the premises since Monday, as was reported by some media outlets, or if he was holding the four women hostage. He said police had never spoken directly to Clavell throughout the negotiations, with all communication coming through a third party. 'I believe he probably had some belief that he was relatively safe at those premises,' he said. 'As to whether he was controlling them or it was more of a free will perspective, there's no doubt they had a harrowing experience. Police guard an entrance to a brothel following a siege involving fugitive  Clavell . 'Whether he made the conscious decision [to release them] or they just decided to get out, it's hard to know.' Mr Dickson said he believed some of the women worked at the premises but was unsure whether all of them did. He said further details of the siege will come after police speak at length with the women, who are all cooperating. Superintendent Peter Harvey said the four women appeared to be uninjured and they had been taken away from the scene to be interviewed by detectives. The last woman to come out was visibly more upset than the other three, he said. 'Our information is and all indications are she's not hurt, but very, very emotional as you'd understand,' Supt Harvey said whole the siege was still underway. 'So we've got to try and calm the ladies down, talk to them and then see where we can go because they’re our best source of what's happening inside.' A close friend of Clavell said he had vowed to kill police if confronted. The friend said she dropped Clavell at escort agency Marilyn's Studio in Adelaide's CBD on Monday and said he was armed with a .22 rifle. 'He thinks [police] have it in for him, he will take police out,' she told The Advertiser. 'He knows he won't survive this alive today.' On Thursday morning police surrounded the building where Clavell was armed with a rifle and a cache of ammunition. The area was locked down by police, which caused major traffic disruptions.

'The people that are with you don't deserve to still be inside,' he said in a direct appeal to Clavell. Supt Harvey said police believe he was armed. 'He has access to, and is likely to have on him now, firearms,' he said. Supt Harvey added that police had been trying to make contact with Clavell since 1am this morning. 'He is not answering a phone that we ring and we would like to take this opportunity to appeal to Rodney to please answer the phone.' He had wanted Clavell to surrender peacefully to police. Supt Harvey acknowledged Clavell’s violent past but said he had served his time for that. 'It's nothing to do with today except to remind us of his propensity for violence,' Supt Harvey said. 'We have been aware for 14 days that he is armed, so we treat him at the highest level of risk. What you see today is unprecedented for Adelaide.' King William Street was closed to all members of the public including all public transport between the block of Halifax Street, Sturt Street, Angas Street, Gouger Street and Wright Street. Clavell had evaded police since a warrant was issued for his arrest over breaching a firearms Prohibition Order on May 20. Police conducted more than 80 raids, seven of which were high risk. On May 22 police searched a house at suburban Edwardstown where Clavell was believed to be hiding, after two Adelaide schools earlier were placed in lockdown as a precaution as heavily-armed police searched a nearby area. Police believe Clavell was a passenger in a rented blue Ford sedan which failed to stop for police on Osmond Street in the inner-city. Both the passenger and driver ran off and the nearby schools were locked down. Police raided two houses on May 21 in suburban Skye, but failed to find him. On May 23, Supt Harvey said police suspected Clavell had access to firearms and considered him as a danger to the community, warning he should not be approached. 'Our taskforce is totally committed to this pursuit,' he said. 'We are aware that certain people are assisting Mr Clavell, the penalties for this is very severe and is up to seven years imprisonment.' A woman walks to police with her hands up. All four women are now assisting police with their inquiries . Clavell had a history of drug use and a long criminal history. In 2004 was the subject of an extraordinary police chase through the Adelaide Hills during which he commandeered a 12-tonne grader from a farm shed. With a shotgun pointed at his own heart, Clavell led police on a slow-speed chase during which he was shot in the thigh by an officer who he had attempted to run down.

"By . Sarah Michael . The NSW corruption watchdog has found former Labor MPs Eddie Obeid and Joe Tripodi engaged in corrupt conduct. The finding by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) relates to retail leases at Circular Quay on the Sydney harbour foreshore in which Mr Obeid's family had financial interests. ICAC also made a finding of corrupt conduct against Steve Dunn, the former deputy chief executive officer and property division head of the Maritime Authority of NSW. Scroll down for video . ICAC has found former Labor MPs Joe Tripodi (left, pictured in November 2013) and Eddie Obeid (right, pictured in February 2013) engaged in corrupt conduct . 'The commission finds that Mr Obeid misused his position as an MP to make representations to ministers and Mr Dunn on various occasions in relation to the management of retail leases at Circular Quay,' the watchdog said in its report released on Thursday. The representations were made to former Labor minister Carl Scully around 2000, and former ministers Michael Costa and Eric Roozendaal between 2003 and 2006, involving the terms of the leases. In Mr Scully's case, ICAC said it was suggested the minister consider offering new leases with five-year terms and options for renewal for five years. This was at a time when Mr Obeid knew the leaseholders had donated $50,000 to the Australian Labor Party as payment for carrying out what they understood to be a promise that their interests would be 'looked after'. ICAC also made a finding of corrupt conduct against Steve Dunn, the former deputy chief executive officer of the Maritime Authority of NSW (pictured in November 2013) Mr Costa and Mr Roozendaal were asked to consider changing government policy to allow direct negotiations for new leases with existing leaseholders, rather than hold an open tender process, ICAC said. But Mr Obeid did not disclose his family had an interest in the Circular Quay leases and would benefit financially if the policy was changed. Mr Obeid also made a similar representation to Mr Tripodi. 'Mr Tripodi engaged in corrupt conduct in 2007 by deliberately failing to disclose to his cabinet colleagues his awareness of the Obeid family's financial interests in Circular Quay leases,' ICAC said. A 'for lease' sign is seen in the retail shop where Quay Eatery was in Circular Quay in central Sydney in 2013. The Obeids had secret interests in a lease at the Quay Eatery . 'Mr Dunn engaged in corrupt conduct in 2007 by using his public official position to benefit Mr Obeid and the Obeid family by effectively bringing about a change to the commercial lease policy, to allow for direct negotiations with existing Circular Quay leaseholders.' ICAC said the Director of Public Prosecutions should be asked to consider prosecuting Mr Obeid for criminal offences of misconduct in public office. It did not make a similar recommendation about Mr Tripodi. Mr Obeid likened ICAC to a Hollywood production, saying he thought there was a 'one per cent' chance of the DPP bringing a case against him. 'If and when it does turn up, if ever it will turn up in a court of law, we will defend it vigorously because we are innocent of any of the allegations which ICAC's brought up,' he told ABC radio. He described ICAC's investigations into him as a political witch-hunt. Mr Obeid and Mr Tripodi were found to have engaged in corrupt conduct relating to retail leases at Circular Quay (pictured) on the Sydney harbour foreshore . 'It is all a media spectacle and it is all Hollywood style and it is all about grabbing media headlines,' he said. Joe Tripodi has been expelled from the Australian Labor Party, in light of the latest NSW corruption watchdog findings. NSW Labor general secretary Jamie Clements announced in a statement that Mr Tripodi's membership, which had previously been suspended, would now be cancelled immediately. A meeting of the party's administrative committee would be held on Friday, he said.

"By . Sarah Dean . A carer found guilty of killing an elderly man and blowing $300,000 of his money on pokies barely shed a tear after she learned of his sudden death. In a police interview taken the night 84-year-old Bill Adamson was murdered with a huge dose of morphine in a Campbelltown motel room in April 2010, gambling addict Kerry Forrest gives a brazen performance. When asked if she knows how he died, the 54-year-old convicted killer replies: 'In his sleep'. Scroll down for video . Brazen: In a police interview, gambling addict Kerry Forrest said she thought Bill Adamson died 'in his sleep'. In actual fact, she killed him with drugs . Fed up: The 'black widow' didn't seem upset about the war veteran's death as she was interviewed by police . The police interview, which was filmed just after midnight on the night of his death, was revealed on Channel Nine's A Current Affair on Wednesday. Ms Forrest was found guilty in the Supreme Court on May 20 of giving the retired realtor the huge dose of morphine, said to be worth about 10 tablets. She met and preyed on Adamson after the death of his wife, Beryl. Within six months, he too was dead. Forgoing her simple role as his carer, she moved in with Mr Adamson and had become increasingly involved in his financial affairs since 2009. Killed: 84-year-old Bill Adamson was murdered with a huge dose of morphine in a Campbelltown hotel room in April 2010 . Evidence: The Campbelltown motel room where the pair were living was found littered with drugs and tissues. Ms Forrest killed Mr Adamson by 'having him ingest MS-Contin', a judge said . She sold his $700,000 Kareela house - leaving them with $300,000 profit - demanded access to his financial records and set up various accounts with his cash. Mr Adamson was a war veteran but despite his age he was still very active. In video taken just days before his death he can be seen bounding up some stairs. Asked how the two became close, Ms Forrest said: 'He would ring me to find out how I was... we struck up a friendship.' On the night he died, she denied their relationship was anything more than employer and employee and laughed when asked if there was any sexual relationship. However, police now know they had a joint bank account and plans to build a new home together. In the week before Mr Adamson's death, the pair were living together in the motel room because the quick sale of his house left them with nowhere to live. Healthy: Mr Adamson was seen bounding up some stairs just days before his death . Moving out: Ms Forrest helped the 84-year-old sell his Kareela home in southern Sydney for $690,000 . Fatal: The room where Mr Adamson was killed . When probed about what happened in the room, Ms Forrest said they had separate beds and explained: 'We actually lay in bed and watched telly. 'I went up to [Woolworths] and got takeaway, the hot chicken. 'He was snoring, really, really, loud. I've never heard him snore.' Mr Adamson died a 'slow two-hour death' on his motel bed. Meanwhile, Ms Forrest went to the dentist after administering the fatal dose. When she noticed he was 'stone cold' and wasn't breathing she did not call 000, but instead phoned for a doctor. Heartbreaking: Bill Adamson pictured with his wife Beryl. Adamson met and fell victim to Forrest after Beryl's death . Hero: The victim was a war veteran who had fought for Australia . 'Ms Forrest misappropriated Mr Adamson's money and killed him to prevent that misappropriation being exposed,' Judge Peter Hidden said when giving his guilty verdict. 'She killed him by having him ingest MS-Contin. 'I cannot be certain how she did so, but it is most likely that she crushed tablets and mixed them with his food.' Ms Forrest pleaded not guilty to the murder and maintained her innocence throughout the seven-week trial. She will be sentenced in August.

"By . Freya Noble . Australia's property market has one of the highest growth rates in the world - well above the U.S, but behind countries like Turkey and China, a new global study says. Property prices increased by 10.9 per cent on last year, enough to push Australia to seventh place on the The Knight Frank Global House Price Index . Property prices increased by 2.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year alone. Dubai, who took out the top spot for the fourth quarter in a row, saw a staggering 27.7 per cent median price increase. Australia has come in seventh on an index of property-price growth . The chairman of CBRE Residential, Justin Brown, told The Sydney Morning Herald Australia's strong ranking did not come as a surprise, and denied it could lead to another property bubble. Mr Brown also said Australia's close proximity to Asia was one of the keys to the price growth, and predicted that our prices would continue to increase. 'We’ve got quite a pent-up demand both domestically and internationally,' he told the publication. Dubai, for the fourth consecutive quarter held fast as the country with highest growth in property prices . House prices around the world have risen consistently over the past few years, according to Knight Frank’s associate director of residential research, Michelle Ciesielski. Globally, the index was up by 0.6 percent, and Kate Everett-Allen, the International Residential Research on the study said 'for the first time since 2008 no single country tracked by the Global House Price Index has recorded an annual price fall in excess of 10%.' The top three places were claimed by Dubai, China and Estonia, while the bottom three in the index of 54 nations were Greece, Cyprus and Croatia.

"By . Ryan Lipman . Australia's remote areas should be used a nuclear dumping ground for the rest of the world, according to former prime minister Bob Hawke. The former Labor leader made the statement in an address about his economic vision for Australia at the National Press Club address in Canberra on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Former prime minister Bob Hawke used his address at the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday to advocate Australia storing nuclear waste from other countries . 'The one thing this country ought to do is have the disposal of nuclear waste in remote areas,' Mr Hawke said. The former politician said his government received reports in the early '90s that highlighted that a nuclear waste disposal industry could flourish and was critical to cleaning the global environment. 'In doing good for the rest of the world we would be doing good for ourselves,' he said. 'We would get an enormous stable flow of income which could be used for the benefit of the world and our own benefit.' The former Labor leader said storing nuclear waste would have economic benefits for Australia, while also having positive environmental impacts for the world . Mr Hawke's comments come despite Australia not producing nuclear energy, with country's only nuclear reactor located at Lucas Heights, in south Sydney. About 80 per cent of the waste produced at Lucas Heights is through the production of nuclear medicine, and includes items such containers, equipment, gloves and plastic. The reactor is run by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, which also processes about 40 per cent of the country's low-level and some intermediate-level nuclear waste on-site. Used fuel from the reactor is shipped overseas for permanent storage or reprocessing primarily in France and also the UK and U.S. Australia's only nuclear reactor, pictured, is located in Lucas Heights, in Sydney's southern suburbs . From 2015, waste produced from reprocessing used fuel, which had been sent to France and the UK, will be returned to Australia as intermediate-level waste and stored in a national radioactive waste management facility yet to be selected by the Federal Government. Mr Hawke also spoke about the country's domestic politics and said states should be abolished because they are a 'blight upon the optimum development of this country'. 'The duplication and all that goes with that division of power is not in the interests of the country,' he said. He also said it was crucial for greater bipartisanship in parliament, was seen in disdain by the Australian people. 'I think something ought to be done to lift the performance in the parliament,' he said. During his address, Mr Hawke also reflected on his own political career. The event was also attended by former Liberal prime minsiter John Howard, with the former politicians attending to mark the 50th anniversary of the club.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A study has claims that honeybees (pictured) rely on a built in 'sat-nav' system to find their way home . It has been claimed that bees solve difficult maths problems and that their tiny brains are better than computers. And now a new study suggests that the insects rely on a built in ‘sat nav’ system to find their way around. Honeybees make ‘mental maps’ of their home ranges allowing them to pinpoint destinations miles away from their hives. While humans, sharks and even pigeons are known to use this technique, it was popularly thought that bees rely solely on the sun’s position to find their way back to their hive. Dr James Cheeseman of Auckland University in New Zealand, said: ‘Only 50 years ago the claim any non-human animal had a cognitive map was deeply controversial because it suggested a computational theory of mind. The question of whether insects do is a frontier question.’ To come up with their finding, scientists captured and anaesthetised honeybees and shifted some of their circadian (body) clocks by six hours to disorientate them. They fitted them with tiny radar transponders to track their movements after releasing them in a different location. The researchers reasoned that if the bees did rely on the sun as a compass, then the alteration to their body clocks would disrupt their ability to find their way home. They found that when the bees with . altered body clocks were let out in a field in Brandenburg, Germany, . they returned with similar speed and accuracy as those that had not been . put to sleep, according to the study published in the journal . Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Although Hv1a/GNA was carried to the brain of the honeybee (stock image), it had no effect on the insect, which suggests the highly selective spider venom toxin does not interact with the calcium channels in the bee . Bees can solve complex mathematical problems which keep computers busy for days, a 2010 study showed. The tiny insects learn to fly the shortest possible route between flowers discovered in random order. Effectively, they are capable of solving the 'travelling salesman problem' - unlike any other animal known besides humans, scientists said. The classic conundrum involves finding the shortest route that allows a travelling salesman to call at all the locations he has to visit. Computers solve the problem by comparing the length of all possible routes and choosing the one that is shortest. Bees manage to reach the same solution using a brain the size of a grass seed. Artificial flowers were used to test bee behaviour. The researchers wanted to know whether bees would follow a simple route defined by the order in which they found the flowers, or look for the shortest route. After exploring the location of the flowers, bees quickly learned to fly the best route for saving time and energy. Dr Cheeseman said: ‘The results suggest bees may navigate by a mental terrain map in addition to learned sun-compass directions.’ It is known that mammals can navigate areas by making cognitive maps - a mental representation of landmarks like rocks, trees and rows of bushes. But it was unclear as to whether insects possess the same skill. ‘The results we report imply the bee is like mammals and birds in that its brain constructs an integrated, metric cognitive map,’ he said. The discovery is remarkable because the brain of the bee is tiny and lacks structures such as the hippocampus, which is used in navigation. But the insects must somehow construct a type of map that includes information on directions, distances, diverse landmarks, feeding sources and terrain features to permit the complicated computation of an efficient journey home. In the experiment, when the bees with altered body clocks were released, they returned with similar speed and accuracy as those that had not been put to sleep, suggesting bees may navigate by a mental terrain map in addition to learned sun-compass directions. A stock image of a honeybee is pictured .","It was thought that bees rely on the sun’s position to find their way home .

"By . Bianca London . A stag or hen do is known as the last night of freedom before committing to someone for the rest of your life - and it seems that some Brits really take advantage of that. New research reveals that a third of stags and hens cheat on their betrothed during their final night of freedom. Worse still, you'll probably never find out because 92 per cent of those who cheated said that they'd kept this from their partner. Are YOU guilty? A new survey has revealed that a third of Brits cheat on their future wife or husband on their stag or hen do . Of these, three quarters (74 per cent) said that they were worried their partner would find out about their . antics through friends or family who had attended their pre-nuptial . celebrations. An honest 8 per cent revealed that they'd confessed to their partners after the event. Those who did cheat were . asked to identify the reasons behind their infidelity with 'I was drunk and things got out of control' being the top reason with 76 per cent of the vote. Blame it on the alcohol: The top reason for unfaithful behaviour was revealed to be: 'I was drunk and things got out of control' The other reasons were: 'I had cold feet and felt stressed about the wedding', 'I wanted to enjoy my last chance of freedom' , 'I had a ""hall pass"" e.g. my partner agreed we could have a fling on our stag and hen dos, and 'I was pressurised by other attendees of the stag or hen do'. All respondents who had been unfaithful were then questioned on whether their stag/hen took place in the UK or abroad, with 67 per cent of unfaithful stags and hens holding their parties abroad and only 33 per cent straying while partying at home in the UK. Finally, . all respondents were asked whether strip clubs or strippers had . been part of their evening, with 62 per cent revealing their parties had . featured strippers or strip clubs, with the average expenditure totalling £120 per person. When . the results were broken down further, it became apparent that there was . a conclusive gender gap with 78 per cent of strip club attendees being male and . 22 per cent female. A spokesperson for vouchercloud, who commissioned the survey, said: . 'I think it’s no secret that when full of alcohol and banter, things . can get out of hand on these events and one of these things is the issue . of cheating.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Pensive: Scientists have shown that free will can be turned on and off by using electrical stimulations to control monkeys' minds (stock image) For centuries free will has been debated - do we have choice over the decisions we make or is it all one big illusion. Now it seems that scientists have proved that it is the latter – at least in monkeys. Researchers have shown that free will can be turned on and off by using electrical stimulations to control primates’ minds. They hope that their findings could lead to new treatments for addiction and depression, among other conditions. In the experiment, artificially stimulating a brain region believed to play a key role in learning, reward and motivation, caused monkeys to change which of two images they chose to look at – essentially, enabling the scientists to make decisions for them. Scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the University of Leuven in Belgium proved for the first time that stimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) – a group of neurons at the base of the mid brain – can change behaviour through activation of the brain’s reward system. ‘Previous studies had correlated increased activity in the primate VTA with positive events experienced by the animal but could not prove that VTA activity actually caused behavioural changes,’ said Wim Vanduffel of MGH, who co-authored the paper published in the journal Current Biology. ‘Studies in rodents have shown that artificially manipulating VTA activity strongly influences behaviour and our work has bridged the gap between rodent and primate,’ he said. To investigate the direct impact of VTA activation on primate behaviour, microelectrodes were implanted within the VTAs of macaque monkeys. The research could one day revolutionise the way that human addicts are treated by enabling them to unlearn addiction, such as alcoholism (illustrated by a stock image) - although there is of course the sinister possibility of using mind control in humans too . Scientists have shown that free will can be turned on and off in monkeys by using electrical stimulations. They artificially stimulated the monkeys' ventral tegmental area (VTA) – a group of neurons at the base of the mid brain – to change behaviour through activation of the brain’s reward system. In an experiment, animals freely chose to look at one of two pictures and by stimulating their VTA, the scientists were able to force them to choose to look at one of them in particular. MRI scans showed that stimulating the VTA produced similar brain activity to when the animal received a reward of fruit juice. The scientists think that the research could one day be used to treat addictive behaviour in humans. In the first set of experiments, the animals were presented with a pair of images – for example a star and a ball – and could freely chose to look at one image or the other. Their choice was measured by looking at their eye movement. After establishing each macaque monkey’s preference, based upon which image it looked at most frequently, mild stimulation was applied to the VTA when the animal happened to look at the initially non-preferred image. Soon the animal’s preference changed and it most frequently looked at what previously had been the less favoured image. When the VTA stimulation was then applied to the initially preferred image, the monkeys soon changed their preference back to the original choice. In a second set of experiments, a monkey watched a 20-minute video, during which two images were randomly presented every 5 seconds. Mind control: In the experiment, artificially stimulating a brain region believed to play a key role in learning, reward and motivation caused monkeys (stock image) to change which of two images they chose to look at - essentially, making decisions for them and controlling their mind . Whenever an initially non-preferred image was presented, it was accompanied by mild VTA stimulation. Repetition of the preference test demonstrated that the animal’s choice was reversed. MRI scans also revealed that stimulating the VTA produced similar brain activity to when the animal received a reward of fruit juice. Dr Vanduffel explained: ‘Our study showed that the timing of VTA stimulation is important – when stimulation happens immediately after an action is performed, the monkey is more likely to perform that action – and that it applies ‘value’ to a particular stimulus and motivates future behaviour.’ ‘Other studies have implicated the VTA in learning based on negative, as well as positive reinforcement, and a recent rodent study found that increasing VTA activation can relieve depression, possibly by increasing motivated behaviour.’ While stimulation currently requires surgery to implant electrodes in the brain, non-invasive methods could be used to treat humans in the future, he told The Times. ‘Once non-invasive methods – light or ultrasound, for example – can be applied with a sufficiently high level of precision, they could potentially be used for correcting defects in the reward system, such as addiction and learning difficulties.’","Scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of Leuven, Belgium, have shown free will can be turned on and off in macaque monkeys .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Dieters choosing low-fat foods in the hope of cutting calories should beware: they can contain even more calories than regular foods, research has found. A new study found that while most low-fat supermarket products contain a third fewer calories than their regular fat version, ten per cent actually have more or the same calories, mainly due to added sugars. Obesity specialist Dr Matthew Capehorn said weight-conscious shoppers should realise that choosing low-fat products made by brands including Weight Watchers could hamper their efforts to cut calories. Low-fat bread and other foods can contain more calories than their regular counterparts, research shows . The study by the Rotherham Institute for Obesity, where Dr Capehorn is clinical director, found that Weight Watchers wholemeal thick slice bread had more calories than any own label, regular fat equivalent, while Weight Watchers sliced cheese also had more calories than own label equivalents. Weight Watchers wholemeal thick slice bread had more calories than any own label, regular fat equivalent. Weight Watchers sliced cheese also had more calories than own label equivalents. Asda natural low-fat yoghurt had more calories than Asda natural yoghurt. Birdseye light and crunchy breaded chicken had more calories than Birdseye crispy chicken. Asda own brand low fat Italian dressing had more fat than the regular fat alternative. It also found that Asda natural low-fat yoghurt had more calories than Asda natural yoghurt and Birdseye light and crunchy breaded chicken had more calories than Birdseye crispy chicken. Often, extra sugar was added to boost the taste of the lower-fat foods. Dr Capehorn said: 'Low-fat foods do appear on average to help reduce calorie intake...however appropriate food choices may still require reading nutritional information on the food labels, as ten per cent of low fat foods still have more calories, and 40 per cent have more sugar, than their regular fat counterparts.' He began the study to establish whether low-fat versions of products were nutritionally healthier than their regular counterparts, mainly in terms of sugar and overall calories. Of the ten most popular UK supermarkets, four provided enough information online for researchers to complete the study in November: Sainsbury's, Asda, Waitrose and Tesco. Fat, sugar . and calorie content for any low fat food that had a directly comparable . regular fat product made by the same brand were recorded. Of . 62 products that matched these criteria found in the four supermarkets, . 56 low-fat products had fewer calories, and on average overall the low-fat products had 31 per cent less calories. However, ten per cent of low fat foods analysed still had more or the same . calories than the regular fat version, while 37 of the 62 products (60 . per cent) had less sugar than the regular fat alternatives. One low-fat product, Asda own brand low fat Italian dressing, had more fat than the regular fat alternative. Dieters hoping yoghurt will help them lose weight should check the calorie content (file image) An example of where there was an obvious calorie saving with the lower fat version was Benecol light spread, which saved 216 kcals/100g compared with Benecol buttery spread. Weight Watchers said it was redeveloping its wholemeal thick sliced bread after research found it had more calories than any ‘own label’ supermarket brand. A spokesperson said: 'Weight Watchers continues to strive to provide customers with high quality Weight Watchers Foods and we are constantly evolving our products to ensure this. 'As such, we are redeveloping the Weight Watchers Thick Sliced Wholemeal Bread to ensure it is the best choice for our consumers.'

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Perhaps one of Einstein’s lasting legacies, aside from his groundbreaking theories and revolutionary equations, has been his brain. Since his death on 18 April 1955 scientists have studied, probed and analysed the organ that was inside the head of one of the greatest minds of the modern era. And previously it had been thought that his abnormal genius was due to a different or enlarged brain - but new research suggests that wasn’t the case, and his brain was just like the rest of humanity. Claims that Einstein may have had a unique brain, which accounted for his great intellect, are wide of the mark according to a new study. It suggests that previous research of the genius's brain were flawed and don't actually prove there was anything special about it . In 1985, a study by Diamond et al claimed that Einstein’s brain had a much higher number of glial cells than those of a more moderate intellect. He proposed there was an elementary particle responsible for transferring light - the photon. He developed his theory of special relativity, which described how time slowed as an object or particle approached the speed of light. His famous mass-energy equivalence equation, more commonly known as E=mc², suggested matter was a form of energy. This led to the development of nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, his theory of general relativity linked space and time interact with each other, known as space-time. Glial cells, also known as neuroglia, are those that provide support and protection for neurons in the brain, with an increase in them thought to possibly indicate a higher brain power. But new research by Dr Terence Hines of Pace University in New York suggests this and other studies were flawed - and there was actually nothing special about the brain at all, reports Discover Magazine’s Neuroskeptic. Einstein’s brain is itself a cause of some controversy - upon his death in 1955 it is rumoured that he had requested his entire body be cremated. But pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey was keen to preserve the greatest mind of a generation, and instead removed the brain just seven and a half hours after his death. Although at the time this was against the wishes of the theoretical physicist, his son Hans later gave his blessing for the brain to be used for science according to National Geographic. This led to that inaugural study in 1985, on which Harvey was a co-author, and since then numerous other scientists have suggested Einstein’s brain was special in some regard. In his new paper, however, Dr Hines disagrees. A specimen of Nobel physicist Albert Einstein's brain is seen in a glass slide at an exhibition at the Wellcome Collection in London on 27 March 2012. Since his death in 1955 Einstein's brain has been meticulously studied, but scientists are apparently no closer to finding out what made him so smart . First, he says of 28 tests done in 1985 comparing Einstein’s brain to other ‘control’ brains, only one was deemed significantly accurate by the researchers at the time. Furthermore, claims Dr Hines, other microscopic analyses ‘found essentially no differences between his brain and that of the controls’. The studies were famously performed with slices of Einstein’s brain, but of that Dr Hines said: ‘to believe that the analyses of one or a few tiny slices of a single brain could reveal anything related to the specific cognitive abilities of that brain is naïve’. He suggests that observers should perform a ‘blind test’ of Einstein’s brain and others, to see if they notice anything that makes it stand out. ‘If there are actual differences, such an experimental methodology would reveal them,’ writes Dr Hines. Einstein also famously once wrote himself that he thought he had a great degree of control over his brain – he said his thoughts were not only visual, but muscular as well. Again, however, Dr Hines debunks these comments as worthless in actual neuroscience, saying it is not possible to perform accurate research of his brain based on a few things he said. It seems in death, after life, Einstein continues to confound scientists across the world of all disciplines. One of Einstein's most famous equations was the mass-energy equivalence (pictured) that proposed matter was a form of energy. This led to the creation of the first nuclear weapons, of which Einstein once said: 'I know not with what weapons World War 3 will be fought, but World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones'","Previous studies have suggested that Einstein had an abnormal brain .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . In Hollywood films, the ‘odd-couple’ often manages to muddle through their differences to enjoy happy lives. But a new study claims that in real life, couples in which one person is lazy, adopt the standards of the lazier person. Individuals in so-called mis-matched relationships - where one person has high self-control and the other very little - often become unhealthy and fritter away their life savings, experts said. The odd couples: Unlike the happy ending of Hollywood film 'Knocked Up' - Katherine Heigel and Seth Rogen as Alison and Ben are pictured - individuals in mis-matched relationships where one person has high self-control and the other very little, often become unhealthy and fritter away their life savings, experts said . The ability to resist anything from an extra slice of cake to a spending splurge is one of the keys to happier living, according to a 2013 study. Researchers at the University of Chicago found that levels of self-control and life satisfaction were inextricably linked after analysing self-report surveys completed by 414 adults. Instead of agonising over whether to indulge in something, those with strong willpower simply found it easier to make the right choices while those who gave into vices were plagued with regret. Study co-author Kathleen Vohs of the University of Minnesota, said people with greater self-restraint are, in essence setting themselves up to be happy. This is apparently because they learn how to 'avoid problematic desires and conflict.' This is rarely a happy outcome in mis-matched relationships such as Alison and Ben's in the film ‘Knocked Up,’ where opposites attract and one person can be motivated by the other’s success. Scientists from the Carroll School of Management at Boston College found that couples with mis-matched levels of self-control and motivation adopt the same level of indulgence as couples made up of two slackers. Hristina Dzhogleva and Cait Poyner Lamberton studied a number of married couples and pairs of students to examine self-control decisions of couples with high self-control, couples with low self-control and those made up of one person who is good at exercising self-restraint and one person who gives into temptation easily. They looked at the behaviour of the couples in the lab as well as at coffee mornings and in online forums, ABC News reported. The challenge of a mis-match: Scientists from the Carroll School of Management at Boston College found that couples with mis-matched level of self-control and motivation - such as Chandler and Monica from Friends - adopt the same level of indulgence as couples made up of two slackers . Unsurprisingly, the scientists found that couples made up of two people with impressive self-control ate healthy diets, saved money and rarely got into debt and the opposite was true of lazy couples who give into temptation. But the joint decisions of mis-matched couples closely resembled those of the lazy couples. ‘Maintaining the relationship is more important for the high self-control partner than sticking to their guns,’ said Ms Dzhogleva. ‘As a result, mixed dyads [mis-matched couples] may end up with worse long-term health and financial outcomes than they may expect.’ While it might sound like an unhappy outcome for such couples is inevitable, Ms Dzhogleva thinks mis-matched couples can have a Hollywood-style happy ending if high self-control individuals in relationships are aware of their tendencies to give in and the people with low self-control compromise. The study revealed that the joint decisions of mis-matched couples closely resembled those of the lazy couples, who often become unhealthy (illustrated left) and fritter away their life savings (stock image right)","Scientists found that couples with a mis-matched .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Spiders disguise themselves as innocuous-looking ladybirds, tree stumps and many more natural objects in order to avoid being eaten. but there is one that mimics something much more disgusting. The Cyclosa ginnaga decorates its web . with a spiral pattern and pieces of dead leaves to make its nest look like bird droppings, in a bid to confuse predators. Although scientists have known about this practice for some time, researchers have only just discovered the reasons why the spider chooses this particular disguise. Scientists have identified a spider called Cyclosa ginnaga that disguises itself as bird droppings to evade predators hunting in forests of South East Asia - and even weaves its web in a way that looks like white bird droppings (pictured) Cyclosa Ginnaga is a species of spider found in Taiwan, China, Japan, and South Korea. Spiders in the genus Cyclosa spin elaborate webs in concentric circles and add debris, such as plant material, prey carcasses and twigs to disguise them from predators, and to sometimes attract dinner. Cyclosa Ginnaga uses dead leaves and silk to make a white blob on its webs that looks like a bird dropping. Because it has a silvery body, the spider is well disguised from predators such as wasps. The disguise is effective as it helps the creature catch food, while evading becoming dinner itself, according to researchers from Tunghai University and the Endemic Species Research Institute in Taiwan. It creates a white disc on its web that functions to attract prey, but because the spider has a silver body, this also makes it inconspicuous to predatory wasps. ‘To the human eye, the size, colour and shape of the body against its decoration resemble bird droppings, and it has been hypothesised that these spiders masquerade as bird droppings to avoid predation,’ according to the study published in Scientific Reports. The scientists showed that the spiders . and their web ornaments look almost identical to bird droppings, both in . colour and in size, when viewed under conditions that replicate how . wasps see them. The disguise is particularly effective as it helps the creature catch food, while evading becoming dinner itself. Researchers studied how both the spiders and their webs (pictured second and fourth row), as well as bird droppings on leaves (top row and third row) appear to wasps, which eat Cyclosa ginnaga . They collected 10 of the spiders and used a spectrometer to measure the wavelengths of light emitted by the spider’s bodies, their webs and bird droppings against a forest backdrop, Smithsonian reported. A computer program was used that mimics the sensory eye cells of bees, enabling the team to see whether wasps - which have similar eye to bees - could distinguish between a potential meal and a dropping. In another experiment, they set up video cameras in front of 12 spider webs and covered some of the spiders’ bodies with black ink and hid web decorations of others, while leaving a handful untouched. They found that wasp attacks were far greater on spiders that had either their webs or bodies blackened with carbon powder or ink, than those remained sliver and had their webs intact. ‘We provide empirical evidence for the first time that bird dropping masquerading can effectively reduce the predation risk of an organism,’ ecologist I-Min Tso of Tunghai University said. Other spiders in the genus Cyclosa decorate their webs - sometimes with plant material and the bodies of prey, as well as weaving thick circles. One particular species even makes a decoy spider to baffle predators.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Following the unveiling of Google's self-driving cars, taxi firm Uber, pictured, has said it could replace all of its drivers with autonomous vehicles . Smartphone apps have already revolutionised the way many of us book taxis, and now developments in technology are about to take this revolution a step further. Following the unveiling of Google’s new self-driving cars yesterday, taxi firm Uber has said it could replace all of its drivers with autonomous vehicles. CEO Travis Kalanick admitted the technology would keep costs down, and these savings could then be passed on to its customers. Speaking at the Code Conference in California, Kalanick said: ‘The reason Uber could be expensive is because you're not just paying for the car - you're paying for the other dude in the car. ‘When there's no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.’ Uber is part of a wave of smartphone apps that match taxi drivers to customers in seconds. The Californian-firm operates in more than 100 cities in 30 countries, but other similar apps are available including Hailo, GetTaxi and, most recently, UK-based Taxicode. Each app lets users compare rates and add credit cards to an account so they don't need cash. They have been criticised by local taxi companies for driving down costs and killing competition. Although Kalanick said that driverless cars are still a new technology, he said the transition would take some time, but was ‘inevitable’. No hands: Google has begun work on the world's first ever self-driving car, an early prototype of which is pictured above . Self-driving cars work by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle's exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree 'view'. These sensors are linked to computer software that is able to 'see¿ and identify people, cars and road signs .

Google plans to have prototypes of its self-driving car ready to test later this summer, and claims the goal is for the car to ‘shoulder the entire burden of driving’. It added the car has a ‘friendly’ face to give a non-threatening appearance and help the public accept the new technology. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be, and a more flexible windscreen, in a bid to be safer for pedestrians. Speed is restricted to 25mph and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically-designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Nasa’s latest solar observatory has captured footage of the sun belching out a stream of charged particles at 1.5 million miles per hour. The curtain of radiation, which erupted on May 9, was the first coronal mass ejection (CME) observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, or Iris. The footage reveals the CME in ‘extraordinary detail’ showing a field of view about five Earths wide and seven-and-a-half Earths tall. Scroll down for video . The line moving across the middle of the animation is the entrance slit for Iris’ spectrograph, an instrument that can split light into its many wavelengths – a technique that ultimately allows scientists to measure temperature, velocity and density of the solar material behind the slit . CMEs are a mass of charged particles and magnetic field energy that bursts from the sun like a volcanic eruption. Material from a coronal mass ejection takes two to three days to reach . Earth, but in this case, the coronal mass ejection didn't affect our planet. Coronal mass ejections interact with Earth’s magnetic field to generate auroras and magnetic storms. The CME's magnetic fields peel back . the outermost layers of Earth's fields changing their very shape, . distortions which can can degrade communication signals and cause . unexpected surges in power grids. They . also can cause aurora. Storms are rare during solar minimum, but as the . sun nears solar maximum, large storms occur several times per year. Because the observatory has to position itself a day in advance, it was a stroke of luck that the eruption happened just as the probe was pointing the right way. ‘We focus in on active regions to try to see a flare or a CME,’ said Bart De Pontieu, the Iris science lead at Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory in California. ‘And then we wait and hope that we'll catch something. This is the first clear CME for Iris so the team is very excited.’ During a CME, changes in the sun’s magnetic fields cause a large section of the surface of the sun to expand rapidly, ejecting billions of tonnes of particles out into space. Iris must commit to pointing at certain areas of the sun at least a day in advance, so catching a CME in the act involves some educated guesses and a little bit of luck. Pictured is the solar flare captured by Iris (right) and the same flare later seen by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (left) Material from a coronal mass ejection takes two to three days to reach Earth, peeling back the outermost layers of the planet’s magnetic field. CME’s can degrade communication signals and cause unexpected surges in power grids. However, this CME is not thought to have made a significant impact on Earth. CME’s often accompany a solar flare – a solar eruption that pushes out waves of light all across the spectrum. Iris can observe both types of eruption. It was launched in June 2013 to study what's known as the interface region, which is a layer between the sun's surface the corona that has long baffled scientists. Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. Astronauts . are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this . manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure . during space walks. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic . storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater . dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric . currents. By capturing light emitted by atoms of . different temperatures, Iris can looks at different heights above the . sun's surface to analyse this obscure layer. The line moving across the middle of the movie is the entrance slit for Iris’ spectrograph, an instrument that can split light into its many wavelengths – a technique that ultimately allows scientists to measure temperature, velocity and density of the solar material behind the slit. While the strength of this CME is yet to be revealed, it follows on the heels of the most powerful type of solar flare that’s ever been recorded by the space agency. The huge event on the sun occurred on 29 March 2014, but Nasa has only now analysed the data from their fleet of observatories. This fleet consisted of four telescopes in space and one observatory on Earth. The flare observed was an X-class flare, the biggest and highest-energy solar flares that have ever been observed. This close-up of the sunspot underneath the March 29, 2014, flare shows incredible detail. The image was captured by the G-band camera at Sacramento Peak in New Mexico. This instrument can focus on only a small area at once, but provide very high resolution . This combined image shows the X-class flare as seen through the eyes of different observatories. The SDO is on the left, which helps show the position of the flare on the sun. The darker orange square is Iris data. The red rectangular inset is from Sacramento Peak. The violet spots show the flare's footpoints from RHESSI . In particular it was an X1 flare, which is the lowest intensity within the X category but significantly more powerful than the majority of flares. Coordinated observations like this are crucial to understanding such eruptions on the sun and their effects on space weather near Earth. Such research can help scientists better understand what catalyst sets off these large explosions on the sun. Perhaps they may even some day be able to predict their onset and forewarn of the radio blackouts solar flares can cause near Earth - blackouts that can interfere with airplane, ship and military communications. This is an artist's concept of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, or Iris, satellite in orbit.

"By . Katy Winter . Celebrities love to court friends in high places, and in one of the more peculiar pairings of recent times Princess Beatrice enjoyed a double date on Wednesday with funny man Jimmy Carr. The two apparent pals dined out at exclusive London restaurant Zuma with their respective other halves. Beatrice was joined by long term boyfriend David Clark for the meal, while Jimmy was accompanied by his partner Karoline Copping. Scroll down for video . Famous friends: Dave Clark, Jimmy Carr, Karoline Copping and Princess Beatrice were spotted leaving Zuma Restaurant last night after a meal together . Both the women chose to wear leather jackets while the gentleman opted for suit jackets for the meal at the high-end Japanese eatery . Beatrice wore a colourful print mini dress, cinched in at the waist with a studded leather belt and left her hair loose . Leaving the luxury Japanese eatery the foursome looked happy and relaxed in each others company, walking alongside each other. Perhaps inspired by the vibrant shades her recent jaunt to Morocco where she attended the second wedding of another celebrity friend Poppy Delevingne, Beatrice, 25,  wore a colourful printed mini dress, cinched in at the waist with a studded leather belt. She added some edge to her outfit with a black leather jacket and high heels, while her 31-year-old boyfriend Dave, a Virgin Galactic executive, kept his look a bit more conservative in jeans and a navy jacket. Beatrice showed off plenty of leg in a short skirt and high heels as she left Zuma (left) while Jimmy and Karoline were happy to stop and pose for waiting photographers (right) The glamorous four left the restaurant after several hours inside, where they dined on modern Japanese izakaya style cuisine . Jimmy also opted for a suit jacket, choosing a more casual round necked T-shirt underneath. The comedian and presenter, 41,  was joined by girlfriend Karoline Copping, a commissioning editor for Channel 5 who he has been dating since 2001. Karoline chose a busy blue and white printed dress for the evening and, mirroring Beatrice, teamed it with a black leather jacket and high heels. Despite having only recently returned from a weekend of partying for Poppy Delevingne's second wedding in Morocco, Beatrice showed no signs of fatigue . Knightsbridge restaurant Zuma serves a twist on the traditional Japanese izakaya style cuisine, and the double daters spent several hours working their way through the menu. Last night marks just one of many social events the Princess has attending recently. Regularly seen out at celebrity hot spots and rubbing shoulders with the A-list, Beatrice has just returned from the star studded second wedding of model and socialite Poppy Delevingne to James Cook in Morocco. The young royal joined other guests including models Alexa Chung, Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Georgia May Jagger, actress Sienna Miller and fashion designer Matthew Williamson.","Young royal and comedian were joined by their partners for dinner .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Today we’re spoiled by the abundance of advanced cameras available, whether it’s just a smartphone’s lens or a professional SLR. But these pictures of New York taken with a Game Boy Camera by photographer David Friedman are oddly alluring, despite paling in comparison to modern technology. Taken in 2000, the photos reveal various locations around New York in ‘stunning low definition’. Photographer David Friedman has revealed his amazing photos of New York life taken back in 2000 using a Game Boy Camera, a primitive accessory for Nintendo's Game Boy that once held the Guinness World Record for the world's smallest camera. Here we see a park bench as a street stretches into the distance . Nintendo’s Game Boy, released in 1989, pioneered the age of modern portable gaming – together with its successor the Game Boy Colour, it sold 118.69 million units worldwide. A little-known accessory released in 1998, though, was the Game Boy Camera. This tiny device, capable of taking black and white photos at a resolution of 256x224, attached into the Game Boy and in 1999 held the Guinness World Record for the world’s smallest digital camera. By modern standards the camera is incredibly primitive, but in 2000 it was a novelty to have such a small device capable of taking photos. And so, as Friedman explains on his website, he took to the streets of New York to give it a shot. Originally he had planned to work on a project adding colour to Game Boy photos, but first he decided to give the accessory a whirl on the streets. Here's two differing views of the Prometheus statue and fountain at the Rockefeller Center main entrance in New York. One is taken through the eyes of Friedman's Game Boy Camera in 2000, while the other is a photo taken on 15 June 2012 with a somewhat more advanced device. We'll let you decide which is which . Look appealing? Here Friedman snaps a classic shot of a slice of New York pizza . Surely anticipating the rise of the selfie, Friedman is seen here snapping a picture of himself with the camera . ‘When I first got the camera, I took a walk through midtown taking pictures,’ he writes. He had forgotten about the photos until recently when he decided to share them. ‘I was doing some general Lightroom file maintenance and was looking at some of my oldest digital images, and there they were,"" he told Business Insider. ‘These aren't actually my oldest digital photos, but they're close.’ Nintendo's Game Boy (left) was released in 1989 and went on to become a worldwide phenomenon in portable gaming, spawning many successors and imitators. The Game Boy Camera (right), meanwhile, was a little-known accessory launched in 1998 that was once the world's smallest digital camera . Guessing game: On one side, the New York Public Library as seen in the year 2000 through the eyes of a Game Boy. On the other, a more recent colour picture taken with a modern digital camera . Here is seen a Giacometti statue, one made by Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti, at the New York Museum of Modern Art . To make them easier to see, they are scaled up by 200%, as originally they were intended only to be viewed on the much smaller Game Boy screen. The photos highlight some iconic locations in New York, and also provide some glimpses of life in the city. In one photo we see the entrance to the Rockefeller Plaza in all its grainy glory; in another just a simple slice of pizza is given the Game Boy treatment. And Friedman even anticipate the rise of the selfie by snapping a picture of himself, all those 14 years ago. Two people on the New York subway are seen through the eyes of the tiny lens on the Game Boy Camera here . No, these aren't real taxis - here Friedman spied a number of toy taxis on the streets of New York and decided to snap a picture . Now you see it: Here a subway speeds past as Friedman grabs a quick snap with the Game Boy Camera .","New York photographer David Friedman has unearthed some old photos .

"By . Julian Robinson . It is usually cats that have nine lives - but this fortunate dog had that and more after he survived a mudslide that trapped him underground for 18 hours. Nicknamed el Afortunado - The Lucky One - he lived through mudslides and chaos caused by torrential rains in Guatemala that have killed five people in recent days. The animal somehow stayed alive despite being stuck in a subterranean tomb and then barked constantly in a bid to attract human attention. Scroll down for video . A breath of fresh air: Afortunado appears for the first time after rescuers find him buried under mudslides in Guatemala . He was buried in Joya Grande village, north-western Guatemala, after an avalanche sent the mountainside crashing on to the primitive houses. Jose Guerdola, one of the team members sent to search for survivors, said: 'We were looking for people and always, always was this faint sound, like a permanent rapping or tapping. 'We assumed it was someone trapped in a cellar who was hitting a pipe. 'We dug and dug, and we sweated and slaved, and as we got closer we realised it was the barking of a dog. 'When we . broke through to where he was he jumped into our arms and licked our . faces. Unfortunately there was no-one left alive in the rubble with him . but we took him to safety.' Good boy: The dog, nicknamed 'The Lucky One' clambers to freedom after being trapped for 18 hours in Joya Grande village in north-western Guatemala . Bid for freedom: The dog wriggled his way out of a hole he had been trapped in for nearly a day after mudslides crashed down on a village in Guatemala . Local vets checked up on Afortunado and, apart from mild shock and dehydration, he was none the worse for his incredible ordeal . The excited pooch jumped in to the arms of his rescuers after being freed and licked their faces . Local vets checked up on Afortunado and, apart from mild shock and dehydration, he is none the worse for his ordeal. He has been placed in the care of a local animal shelter until a family can be found that will take him in. Guatemala's rainy season, which runs from May through November, dumps an average of up to 400 millimetres of rain per month, often causing severe flooding and deadly avalanches in the poor Central American nation of roughly 15 million people.","Dog was buried underground for 18 hours after mudslide in Guatemala .

"By . Ruth Styles . He might have a farmer for a father but Prince Harry looked slightly ill at ease when confronted with an enormous bull during a visit to the Suffolk County Show in Ipswich this afternoon. Nothing daunted, the royal carried on chatting to its owner - even when the Red Poll began to beadily roll its eyes. Luckily for Harry, the rest of the animals at the showground proved less intimidating, with the prince even crouching down for a cuddle with one calf. Afterwards, the prince was taken to meet a flock of prize-winning sheep and this time, eagerly squatted down for a closer look. Then, after a chat with the animal's excited young owner, Harry beamed as he posed for a photo with the junior shepherd. Scroll down for video . Fright night: Prince Harry maintains a safe distance from the beady-looking Red Poll bull while he chats to its owner during a visit to the Suffolk Show . Hello there: The two bulls were kept on a tight leash by their owners who had gathered in the parade ring ahead of their visit from the prince . No touching! This smaller bull seemed less than impressed to meet Prince Harry and even frothed at the mouth as the royal visitor approached . Much better! An adorable calf found more favour with the prince, who crouched down to say hello - much to the delight of its handlers . During his tour of the show, which also received a royal visit from his mother Princess Diana in 1986, the prince was also introduced to a Suffolk Punch horse, a traditional breed of heavy horse that is now considered endangered. After giving the animal a friendly pat, the prince met troops from his former base at Wattisham Flying Station . before completing his whistle-stop tour of Suffolk by enjoying a parade of Royal British Legion standards through the showground. Harry's day had started more than six hours earlier with an appearance at a coaching session run by Inspire Suffolk, a charity that aims to help under-privileged children. Asked to join in, the prince obliged with alacrity but typically, pulled out all the stops to win a penalty shoot out against a group of excited Suffolk school children. Lights, camera... Prince Harry looked on suave form, despite the miserable weather, and stopped to pose for a photo with one young fan - and his flock of sheep . Royal inspection: Prince Harry cuddles up to one of the sheep being paraded around the ring during the Suffolk Show near Ipswich . Cosy chat: Prince Harry stops for a chat with one slightly overwhelmed young fan who stood proudly waiting to greet the prince with his prize-winning sheep . Magnificent: Prince Harry is introduced to a working Suffolk Punch horse by his owners. Sadly, the horses are now an endangered species . Tastes good! After inspecting the livestock, Prince Harry then continued on to the food tents, where he met children busily preparing pizzas . Cooking lesson: The prince beamed as he listened to instructions from the class teacher - perhaps a handy hint for future use at Kensington Palace . Grinning from between the goal posts, the prince took his goal-keeping duties seriously, ensuring that not one of the children lined up against him managed to score their penalty. Despite his antics, nothing could dampen the children's enthusiasm, with his pint-sized opponents describing the royal visitor as a 'funny' chap who 'kept making lots of jokes'. Harry, who . is fresh from a successful three-day tour of Estonia and Italy, . impressed local children with his talent for touch rugby and even took . part in a game of football, although soon found himself on the receiving . end of a powerful tackle. 'He tackled me and won the ball but I managed to tackle him back,' revealed nine-year-old Aryon Tandel, from Ipswich. 'He was taking it quite seriously.' So that's how it's done! Prince Harry and a new young friend discuss the perfect toppings for a pizza - in this case mozarella, tomatoes, mushrooms and herbs .

Limbering up: The prince prepares for the first penalty while taking part in a shoot out during a visit to a coaching session for children near Ipswich in Suffolk . Not getting past me! The prince concentrates intently as a ball booted by one of the young players comes whizzing towards his nose . Got it! Prince Harry stretches out a long leg and hooks the incoming ball away from his goal, knocking it safely into a far flung corner of the field . Ducking and diving: Prince Harry seemed to be enjoying himself during his stint in goal - during which not one ball slipped past him . Another young fan, Brandon Norman, eight, from Ipswich, managed to score a goal against Harry's team - much to his delight. 'He gave me a tap around the ear and said well done,' said the delighted boy. The prince - who met the children during a . visit to Inspire Suffolk, a community project in Ipswich - is the vice patron . of the Rugby Football Union, and also took part in a game of rugby - which he took just as seriously as he did the football. 'He was funny and making lots of jokes,' revealed one nine-year-old opponent, George Hill from Ipswich. 'He told me I had to stay behind the ball and joked that if I went in . front again he would slap me!' Equally . impressed was 11-year-old Jake Katz Roberts from Islington in north . London, who was one of the few who managed to evade one of the prince's . lunging tackles. 'He told me: ""That's the last time you're going to skin me,"" revealed the young rugby player, adding: 'Harry was really fun and got stuck in.'

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Lost amid Wayne Rooney’s struggle to define his role in Roy Hodgson’s team is the fact that many young England starlets have the chance to prove the manager can count on them in Brazil. Luke Shaw is expected to start his first full international at left-back against Ecuador in Miami’s Sun Life Stadium, with Ross Barkley also in contention to start his first England game in midfield. As Roy Hodgson prepares to experiment and try a few different options it could be one of the least experienced England team for many years, offset of course by Frank Lampard and Rooney, who have close to 200 caps between them. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sterling, Shaw and Barkley before they start for England tonight . One to watch: Ross Barkley will get his chance to impress for England against Ecuador in Miami . There is another chance to look at Raheem Sterling, to see James Milner in an unfamiliar position at right-back and for Ben Foster to start his first international for nearly four years. After watching something like his first-choice team win 3-0 at home to Peru, this is the first big test for Hodgson’s admirable policy to take his young lions to Brazil. Scratch the surface of the first team and suddenly England have a different profile, with central defenders Chris Smalling and Phil Jones, who do not always play at Manchester United, let alone in tandem in central defence. Up front, Rickie Lambert, 32 years old and quite possibly still high after completing a transfer to his beloved Liverpool and yet still a World Cup rookie with only 110 minutes of competitive international football under his belt. In midfield Jack Wilshere is expected to start as he continues his bid to prove his fitness over 90 minutes and challenge Jordan Henderson for a place alongside Steven Gerrard. Breather: Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade Chamberlain will also start in England's midfield . Chance: Ben Foster will start between the posts for England while James Milner will play at right back . Can Wilshere stay fit? Is Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, out for six weeks with a groin problem, ready for the rigours of a World Cup? Hodgson will probably learn far more from this experimental line-up in Florida than he did at Wembley against the Peruvians. The England boss has tinkered, trying different personnel in different formations in tactical training sessions since the squad came together, including at times a diamond midfield and two up front, similar to the way Liverpool play, but on Tuesday in training at the Sun Life Stadium he used the 4-2-3-1 shape he has come to trust in the recent games. The side he lined up - Foster; Milner, Smalling, Jones, Shaw; Lampard, Wilshere; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Barkley, Rooney; Lambert - has a total of just 303 caps, at an average of 27.5 each. Take Lampard and Rooney out of the equation and the rest of the team has an average of 12.2 caps, the bulk of which will have been earned in non-competitive fixtures. This fresh and youthful feel has so far been a boost for England, helping to banish the lingering bitterness of past failures and generate the positive energy which has been a feature of the camp during their first two and a half weeks together. Out to impress: Raheem Sterling will hope to come off the bench and look good in front of Roy Hodgson . This game against Ecuador, however, is a genuine challenge. Do they have the talent and mental strength to get through in unfamiliar surroundings and in heat and humidity against opponents who are expected to be much stronger and more purposeful than Peru? Ecuador finished above Uruguay in the South American qualifying group and 18-year-old Shaw will be up against their captain Antonio Valencia, of Manchester United. Valencia did not look like the 70-cap star-man when he arrived at the Sun Life Stadium for training last night, helping the coaches to carry boxes of food into the dressing room. Shaw, who made his England debut as a half-time substitute against Denmark in March, has played against many wingers of comparable quality in the Barclays Premier League this season but he cannot boast the experience of football in this climate, against a team used to playing in the heat. So far, without fuss, he has passed every test thrown his way in a breakthrough season. Hodgson will hope to see his steady progress continue. Just as he will hope others prove his bold selection policy right in the Miami heat.

"By . Leon Watson . It's the quintessentially British game that can last up to five days, involves breaks for lunch and tea and has a bewildering array of impenetrable rules. And, so far, this most genteel of games has never quite been a big hit in America. But now sports fans in the U.S. will be seeing far more of cricket as America's first-ever national league kicks off. Scroll down for video . Cricket is coming: John Adams High School batsman Derick Narine, left, raises his bat on a ball from Midwood High School bowler Rahim Khan, right,during a Public School Athletic League cricket match, at Marine Park in Brooklyn, New York . Rather genteel: In New York City, the sport is so fashionable - and space so limited - that cricket enthusiasts must compete in a lottery to play in some parks . The competition will feature 17 teams from across the U.S.who will take to the field in the American Cricket Champions League. It is due to culminate in October, when six of the teams will meet in Florida for a play-off tournament to decide the U.S. national champions. Each one-day match in the competition consists of 40 overs per side. Cricket is wildly popular in former countries of the British Empire. The game is played on a field known as a pitch, but the pitcher is called a bowler. The bowler hurls the ball to the opposing team's batsman, who attempts to hit it with a flattened bat. Depending on how well the ball travels, a hit can result in one or more runs. In the most traditional forms, a team bowls until 10 opposing batsmen are tagged out, meaning matches can run for days. In other forms, the game is limited by the number of 'overs,' a series of six throws. Sport of cricket: The game being played at Marine Park in the Brooklyn borough of New York. John Adams won the match 112-80 runs . Howzat? The launch of the ACCL coincides with a surging demand for new cricket pitches in U.S. cities . Breaking boundaries: Most of the 30,000 players are immigrants from former British colonies . Sticky wicket: In cricket, batters and wicket keepers must wear leg pads and helmets to primarily protect the shin bone and head against impact from the ball, which can surpass 90 mph after its bowled . Enthusiasts say areas such as New York . City, California’s Silicon Valley, Washington, D.C., Dallas and Chicago . have become cricket hotbeds, fueled by an influx of mostly South Asian . immigrants, some of whom arrived as part of the high-tech boom. In . the immigrant-rich New York area, cricket has become so popular that . lotteries are being held for the chance to play in pitches at some . parks. New York City schools . still have the only varsity cricket league in the country, but it has . doubled in size in just seven years, with 30 teams now competing for the . title. John Aaron, the executive secretary of the American Cricket Federation, said cricket is now in a similar position to football. 'When soccer first started here, people said it's not going to go anywhere - American football is the thing,' Mr Aaron said. 'Soccer has not replaced American football, but it has certainly taken off now, hasn't it? It's attracting  international teams coming here to play. Cricket can do the same thing.' According to the United States of America Cricket Association, the U.S. has an expanding base of cricket enthusiasts, with more than 1,100 teams playing in local leagues. Most of the 30,000 players are immigrants from former British colonies, but the association hopes to expand its reach by introducing American schoolchildren to the sport. The U.S. Youth Cricket Association has donated some 1,500 sets of cricket equipment to community youth programmes in states across the US. Not every cricketing initiative has proved successful. Indianapolis spent more than $5m on a cricket pitch in one of its parks. But last week the city pulled out of hosting a Usaca tournament in August, claiming a communications breakdown. Sunil Kumar, of Usaca, explained: 'The costs for teams, families and fans to travel and stay in Indianapolis were just exceptionally high.'","17 teams will compete in America's first-ever national league .

"By . Chris Foy . Follow @@FoyChris . Graham Rowntree is one of very few Englishmen who knows what it’s like to beat the All Blacks in New Zealand. It has only happened twice: first in 1973 and again in June 2003, when the side captained by Martin Johnson claimed a landmark 15-13 victory in Wellington en route to World Cup glory in Sydney five months later. Rowntree attributes that victory to supreme self-belief, and is adamant that the class of 2014 have that in abundance. On the training pitch: Former England international Graham Rowntree is Stuart Lancaster's forwards coach . The 43-year-old was the tourists’ starting loosehead prop on a night when the England pack stood firm in a series of scrums on their own line, despite having two men in the sin-bin. Rowntree, now Stuart Lancaster’s forwards coach, has suggested that the success he was part of 11 years ago was founded on confidence and a refusal to succumb to the hosts’ formidable reputation. ‘It’s been referenced a lot, that victory,’ he said in Auckland. ‘It was a special night and what it took was an incredible amount of self-belief. ‘We were lucky because Carlos Spencer missed a few opportunities with ball in hand and shots at goal. But we stuck in there. We were down to six men in a scrum on our own goalline in one period because we had Lawrence (Dallaglio) and Neil (Back) in the sin-bin ... cheers! ‘It’s hard enough with a full deck of cards against the All Blacks, never mind being down to six!

Brown; Yarde, Tuilagi, Eastmond, May; Burns, Care; Marler, Webber, Wilson; Launchbury, Parling; Haskell, Morgan, Robshaw (capt) ‘We were hanging on for dear life, but that’s rugby — digging in when you’re facing adversity. ‘That was a significant win for that group of players who went on to win the World Cup. It was a stepping stone and that’s what this is for this group of young players. Pitching yourself against the best at Eden Park — it doesn’t get any better or harder than that.’ As England’s reinforcements from the clubs in the Premiership final left Heathrow on Monday, the men already in Auckland were continuing the countdown to Saturday’s daunting series opener against the world champions at a stadium where the All Blacks are defending a 20-year unbeaten record. ‘It’s there to be broken,’ said Rowntree. ‘Our mind-set in 2003 was, “Let’s get after them”, and that’s the same mind-set that we had at Twickenham in 2012 (when England claimed a record 38-21 win). Airborne: England's Chris Ashton scores a try during the 38-21 win over the All Blacks at Twickenham in 2012 . 'We talk about giving the opposition what they don’t want, but we have to better New Zealand’s physicality because, crikey, they bring enough physicality. It’s about not showing them too much respect.’ Gloucester centre Billy Twelvetrees was unable to train again on Monday, meaning he is now certain to miss the Auckland clash.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The Winter Olympics may be over for another year but that hasn’t stopped an Australian building a street version of the superfast sled - powered by jets. Daz Fellows’ luge is fitted with two thrusters that produce 200lbs (91kg) of thrust each. Fellows claims his design has the potential to reach 311mph (500km/h) and he plans to take on the current world record of 115.83 mph (186km/h) next year. Scroll down for video . Australian Daz Fellows, pictured, began working on his street luge last year. It has already undergone various road and wind tunnel tests. This test was carried out in New South Wales earlier this week. The luge, pictured, is 9.84ft (3 metres) long and is fitted with two jet thrusters . The record for the world’s fastest street luge was set by Jason Bradbury on the set of The Gadget Show’s 200th episode in Bentwaters Parks, Suffolk, in 2011. Fellows goes by the stage name Daz the Cowboy and is a TV stuntman from New South Wales. He claims the board is a complete redesign of the streetluge dubbed Jet Luge. It is made from carbon fibre with a full carbon fibre fuel cell. At 9.84ft (3 metres) long, the luge has also been referred to as a ‘man-sized’ skateboard controlled using a thumb accelerator, and lean steer turning. Fellows claims his jet-powered street luge, also called Jet Luge, pictured, is capable of reaching speeds of up to 311mph (500 km/h). It has additionally been dubbed a 'man-sized skateboard' The thumb-controlled wheel increases or decreases power by rolling a thumb over it to control speed. This wheel can be set at a pre-determined speed, or used as a dynamic accelerator. Alternatively, . the luge can be fitted with a trigger grip control where the rider can . use their pointer finger to control acceleration. At full power, the turbines, pictured, produce 200lbs (91kg) of thrust each, and afterburners on the tail add an extra 35 per cent to 43 per cent thrust.

The entire powered system is routed to a kill switch cable attached to the rider, and in the event of an emergency the cable is pulled free and everything shuts down. A secondary unit is positioned behind, and in the event the rider cannot see, a second person can hit that button and shut the entire system down. Fellows became involved in, and was one of the original founders of, street luge in Australia 1996. The luge, pictured left, features lean steer turning. A wheel increases or decreases power by rolling a thumb over it to control speed. Alternatively, the luge can be fitted with a trigger grip where the rider can use their pointer finger to control acceleration. It was designed and assembled by Fellows over 18 months . Following further wind tunnel tests, pictured, Fellows will attempt to break the world record between April and August 2015. By doing it during the Australian winter, Fellows claims it will help keep running temperatures down and maximise thrust output . His luge was designed and assembled with his team and involved hundreds of hours of design and testing. They have spent the last 18 months building the board from scratch. His record attempt will be carried out between April and August 2015. Fellows claims this is to help keep running temperatures down and maximise thrust output. Dimensions .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . People are constantly advised to stay hydrated every day by drinking plenty of water. But sometimes time just slips away, and it can be hours before someone realises they’ve forgotten to take just a sip. So with that in mind, Vittel has invented a simple yet effective bottle cap with an in-built ‘alarm’ that you can set to remind you when to drink. Scroll down for video . The Vittel Refresh Cap was designed by French marketing agency Oglivy Paris. At first glance it might look just like a regular bottle cap. Many dieters attempt to fill themselves up with water in the belief it will help them lose weight. But one nutrition expert says it is simply a myth that drink water aids slimming. Dr Beth Kitchin, at the University of Alabama, has stated that drinking water is not a magical key to weight loss. She said: ‘There is very little evidence that drinking water promotes weight loss - it is one of those self-perpetuating myths.' But closer inspection remains the small ‘timer’ band beneath the top. To use the cap, it is screwed like normal onto the top of a regular bottle. When it is screwed in place, though, a timer is set in motion. After an hour it activates a little spring inside the cap the causes a flag at the top to pop up, grabbing a person’s attention. The cap has been part of an experiment to see if it encourages people to hydrate more often. According to agency Oglivy Paris, initial findings ‘show people drank more water during the day and enjoyed it.’ As of yet there is no news as to whether this will be made commercial for the general public.

Shot by Michael Hauptman in Fanning's Los Angeles hometown, the shoot sees the starlet posing prettily in a series of sweet candy coloured crop tops and frothy pastel skirts. Scroll down for video . Cool kid: Elle Fanning may just be 16 but she's already a film star and a fashion fan's favourite . But while all eyes might have been on her chic summer wardrobe, the fashion site's writers were more interested in her style tips. 'I’m very girlie,' she told the magazine, 'so it used to be a lot . of Peter Pan collars and pouffy dresses, [but] now I’m getting older, I feel . like I can wear things [that are] a bit more structured and a bit more tomboyish. She added: 'I’m . OK with wearing trousers now, but when I was 12, I was like: ""No, that’s . for boys!""' Elle, who is the sister of fellow Hollywood actress, Dakota, is currently starring as Princess Aurora alongside Angelina Jolie in Maleficent, a dark re-imagining of the 1959 Disney classic. Fun time: Elle models the best of ASOS' cute and kitsch summer range in a range of kooky cat motif tops . But despite the poised on-screen performance, Fanning has confessed to feeling nervous about meeting co-star Jolie for the first time. Speaking to Teen Vogue, the starlet said:  'I remember I came to the studios and they were like, . ""Oh you're going to meet her today"" and I'm like: ""I am not prepared!"" 'So . [then] I turn[ed] the corner and then I saw her, like Angelina Jolie in the . flesh and she gave me a huge hug. 'She like . shook my shoulders and said: ""We're going to have the best time working . together!""' And Angelina isn't the only A-lister who has managed to turn Fanning's nerves to jelly.

The dedicated training section, pictured right, features tutorials to help players master more advanced techniques . He found that if the ball is not rotating, its trajectory is more likely to be affected by the airflow over the undulations of the ball's stitching, making it move in the air. Applied to football, by hitting the so-called 'sweetspot' of the ball, just above the equator with a big toe, the player can produce a shot which reaches its maximum height, before dipping sharply. It’s a technique used by Gareth Bale and David Beckham among others.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Just can't stop? Scientists say our inability to stop eating junk food is called 'hedonic hyperphagia' It is the question that plagues anyone with a sweet tooth or those partial to a biscuit - or ten. Now, scientists claim to have partially unravelled mystery of why some snacks seem impossible to eat in small amounts. While some might call it greed, another name for such behaviour is 'hedonic hyperphagia,' says German scientist Dr Tobias Hoch. 'That's the scientific term for eating to excess for pleasure rather than hunger. 'It's recreational over-eating that may occur in almost everyone at some time in life - and the chronic form is a key factor in . the epidemic of overweight and obesity.' Dr Hoch and his team from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany scanned the brains of rats as they ate either crisps, a powdery mixture of fat and carbohydrates, or ordinary chow pellets. The rats were far more keen on the crisps, despite the fat and carbs mixture containing the same number of calories. Standard pellets were the least popular food. 'The effect of potato chips (crisps) on brain activity, as well as feeding behaviour, can only partially be explained by its fat and carbohydrate content,' said Dr Hoch. 'There must be something else in the chips that make them so desirable.' High levels of fat and carbohydrate had been thought to send pleasing messages to the brain, leading people to gorge on calorie-packed snacks. The magnetic resonance imaging scans showed that reward and addiction centres in the rats' brains were most active when they ate crisps. Food intake, sleep, activity and movement were also stimulated differently by crisps compared with other food. 'By contrast, significant differences in the brain activity comparing the standard chow and the fat carbohydrate group only appeared to a minor degree,' Dr Hoch added. There must be something special about the crisps that was sparking the rats' interest, he said. One theory is that there are  triggers in snacks and sweets that stimulate the brain's reward centres. No stop valve: Some people may have differing sensitivity to reward signals from food -  which may explain why some of us are more susceptible to moreishness than others . And some people may have differing sensitivity to reward signals -  which may explain why some individuals are more susceptible to moreishness than others, the scientists believe. 'Possibly, the extent to which the brain reward system is activated in different individuals can vary depending on individual taste preferences,' said Dr Hoch. 'In some cases, maybe the reward signal from the food is not strong enough to overrule the individual taste.' He added that pinpointing the molecular triggers in snacks and sweets that stimulate the brain's reward centres could lead to the development of new drugs or food additives that combat over-eating. Identifying the triggers is the German team's next project. The findings were presented to the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans.","Some of us may be more sensitive to the reward signals from food .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . There is 'no compelling medical reason' for U.S. armed forced to ban transgender Americans from serving, according to a report released on Thursday. The independent commission led by a former U.S. surgeon general also concluded that President Obama could lift the decades-old ban without approval from Congress. As long-term soldiers share their stories of being kicked out of the forces, the report says the current regulations - which are designed to keep transgender people from joining or staying in the military on the basis of psychological and physical unfitness - are outdated. One former soldier, Army Reserve Capt. Sage Fox, 41, was put on leave after taking female hormones following a deployment to Kuwait. Scroll down for video . Battle: Army Reserve Capt. Sage Fox, pictured, began taking female hormones and living as a woman after being deployed to Kuwait. But after notifying her battalion commander, Fox learned she had been placed on inactive status . In November, with her hair getting long and her voice higher, she . notified her battalion commander, whom she said expressed support. At . drill time, an announcement was made to 400 colleagues at the B.T. Collins Reserve Center in Sacramento. For a few days, Fox thought she might escape the ban. But then she was informed she had been placed on inactive status. 'When . I transitioned, I wasn't just a good officer, I became a better officer . because I didn't have to deal with that conflict anymore,' she said. Fox also wrote a blog post . about the incident, explaining that she had repeatedly been recognized . as a good soldier, but after she revealed her desire to transition, 'I . received no disability, no compensation, no handshake, no . thank-you-for-your-service'. 'In the days and weeks that followed an anger grew within me,' she wrote. 'Not just at the way I was treated, but at the way my fellow trans service-members are cast out of the services they’ve given so much of their lives and devotion to. We are NOT broken. We are NOT diseased or disordered.' New life: Fox, pictured left, and right before her hormone treatment, said living as a woman made her a better soldier because she was no longer in conflict but she said did not even get a thank you for her service . About 15,500 transgender personnel are currently . serving, nearly all under their birth genders and not transitioning in . an appearance-altering way, according to the Williams Institute, a think tank. Dr. Joycelyn Elders, who served as . surgeon general during Bill Clinton's first term as president, and Rear . Adm. Alan Steinman, a former chief health and safety director for the . Coast Guard, led the report that was released on Thursday. 'We determined not only that there is no compelling medical reason for the ban, but also that the ban itself is an expensive, damaging and unfair barrier to health care access for the approximately 15,450 transgender personnel who serve currently in the active, Guard and reserve components,' it said. The panel, convened by a think tank at San Francisco State University, said the ban has existed for several decades and apparently was derived in part from the psychiatric establishment's consensus, since revised, that gender identity issues amounted to a mental disorder. The ban also appears based on the assumption that providing hormone treatment and sex reassignment surgeries would be too difficult, disruptive and expensive. But the commission rejected those notions as inconsistent with modern medical practice and the scope of health care services routinely provided to non-transgender military personnel. 'I hope their takeaway will be we should evaluate every one of our people on the basis of their ability and what they can do, and if they have a condition we can treat we would treat it like we would treat anyone else,' Elders said in an interview with The Associated Press. Report: Former Surgeon General Dr Joycelyn Edlers, left, and Rear Admiral Alan Steinman, right, led a report released on Thursday that said the law about transgender military personnel was outdated . At least a dozen nations, including Australia, Canada, England and Israel, allow military service by transgender individuals. Transgender rights advocates have been lobbying the Pentagon to revisit the blanket ban in the U.S. since Congress in 2010 repealed the law that barred gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals from openly serving in the military . 'At this time there are no plans to change the department's policy and regulations which do not allow transgender individuals to serve in the U.S. military,' said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a defense department spokesman. The commission argued that facilitating gender transitions 'would place almost no burden on the military,' adding that a relatively small number of active and reserve service members would elect to undergo transition-related surgeries and that only a fraction might suffer complications that would prevent them from serving. It estimated that 230 transgender people a year would seek such surgery at an average cost of about $30,000. Decisions: Congress would not need to be involved in changing the rules, according to the report, and Obama could instead issue an executive order instructing the Department of Defense to amend its regulations . Retired Brigadier General Thomas Kolditz, a former Army commander and West Point professor on the commission, said he thinks allowing transgender people to serve openly would reduce gender-based harassment, assaults and suicides while enhancing national security. But Center for Military Readiness President Elaine Donnelly, whose group opposed the repeal of the ban on openly gay troops, predicted that putting transgender people in barracks, showers and other sex-segregated could cause sexual assaults to increase and infringe on the privacy of non-transgender personnel. 'This is putting an extra burden on men and women in the military that they certainly don't need and they don't deserve,' Donnelly said. The commission recommends the president issue an executive order instructing the Department of Defense to amend its regulations so transgender people are no longer automatically barred. The Pentagon then would need to develop rules for assigning service members who are transitioning, said Palm Center Executive Director Aaron Belkin, whose San Francisco State-based think tank commissioned the report. The Palm Center, which previously researched 'don't ask, don't tell,' is funded in part by a $1.3 million grant from Jennifer Pritzker, a billionaire former Army lieutenant colonel who came out as transgender last year.

"By . Whitehall Correspondent . Britain's aid spending increased by more than any other European country last year. The budget rose by 28 per cent, allowing the UK to hit its target of spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas development. It means it has retained its place as second only to the United States in terms of the size of its development budget. Rise: Britain spent £10.6billion on overseas aid in 2013 - up from £8.3billion the year before . The figures, collated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, show Britain spent £10.6billion on overseas aid in 2013 – up from £8.3billion the year before. The total is second only to the US, which spent £18.9billion, but that represents just 0.19 per cent of its GDP. It is a mark of success for the UK, coming ahead of Germany, France and Russia in the league tables . Germany spent only 0.38 per cent, France 0.41 per cent and Russia 0.03 per cent. The OECD said it was alarmed that spending in sub-Saharan Africa had fallen by 4 per cent, while states such as China and India would enjoy year-on-year increases until 2017, often in the form of soft loans. Many Conservative backbenchers are incensed that the Coalition has protected aid spending at a time when public  services are facing stringent cuts.","Budget rose by 28 per cent allowing UK to hit 0.7% GDP spending target .

"By . Eleanor Harding . After making her name as Britain’s youngest shepherdess, she is used to smashing barriers. But now Emma Gray has gone one step further – by becoming the first woman to win a prestigious sheepdog championship in the contest’s four-decade history. The 27-year-old impressed judges in the Northumberland Sheepdog Trials League, which began in 1976, with her six-year-old sheepdog Roy, who she has had since he was a puppy. Shepherdess Emma Gray, 27, from Elsdon, Northumberland, who has become the first woman to win a sheepdog trial championship in its history . Emma Gray and her winning sheepdog Roy wowed judges who awarded her top marks . The award is the latest high point in her extraordinary rise from helping out at her parents’ farm in Hawick in the Scottish Borders to winning the mantle of running a National Trust farm in Northumberland aged just 23. Miss Gray, who is the third generation in her family to work in farming, said: ‘I am really proud to be the first woman to have won the trials and I feel overwhelmed by it all. ‘I was one of only a handful of women taking part; it is a very male-dominated sport, so it feels like an amazing achievement.’ The league involves more than 30 dogs competing in 25 trials over the course of a season and Miss Gray said she was determined to triumph. ‘It was always my ambition to win,’ she said. ‘When I  first started competing there was a shepherd sat in the judge’s car who put money  on me to win. That was my first trial. I am pleased to have won him his bet.’ Last year Miss Gray published an autobiography called One Girl And Her Dog, describing her quest for romance as a singleton in the wilderness. Miss Gray began working with dogs at 13, and is is currently training Roy¿s five-month-old puppies . League chairman Bevis Jordan said: ‘I cannot remember any other women winning. It has always been won by  a man before this. It is a  good achievement for her because she has not been trialling for very long. ‘She has been consistently good all through this season. There are one or two women that compete as well but she is strong competition for everybody at the minute. ‘There does seem to be a few more women willing to participate in this sport now.’ Miss Gray is currently training Roy’s five-month-old puppies and said that  they take after their father. She began working with  dogs at 13 and said that  by the time she was 17, she knew it was her calling, choosing to study sheep management at college. Aged 23, after a heartbreaking split from her fiancé, she convinced the National Trust to give her sole tenancy of the 150-acre Fallowlees Farm. The property has no mains electricity or gas supply and uses a windmill-powered hot water system. But Miss Gray, who has represented England in  the International Sheepdog Trials, has run the farm successfully ever since. Last year she published an autobiography called One Girl And Her Dog, describing her quest for romance as a singleton in the wilderness. She was nicknamed ‘Britain’s loneliest shepherdess’ and the book sparked a rush for her affections. But yesterday she revealed she has found love with a local vet, although she still lives on her farm alone. She said: ‘I suppose you could say I am no longer Britain’s loneliest shepherdess. ‘We have been together for ten months and everything is going well.’","Emma Gray has become the first female winner of the Northumberland Sheepdog Trials League, which began in 1976 .

"By . Jenny Hope . Smokers should cut down on cigarettes if they can't give up, according to new guidance from British health professionals. The National Institute for Health and . Care Excellence (Nice), has finally conceded that although stopping . completely is the best way to reduce health risks, many people are . unable to do so. The landmark guidance has been issued to reduce tobacco-related harm for people struggling to kick the habit. It is also the first official endorsement of nicotine-containing products which can be used to help people cut down on the amount they smoke. Scroll down for video . The National Institute of Health and Care have said that smokers can reap benefits if they cut down and do not quit their habit. They say that substituting some cigarettes with nicotine replacement therapies should help . Those targeted by the advice include . people who may not be able to give up smoking immediately, those who . want to stop smoking without giving up nicotine and those who might not . be ready to stop but want to reduce the amount they smoke. Professor Mike Kelly, director of the Nice Centre for Public Health, opened a press briefing about the guidance with a Mark Twain quote: 'Giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world. 'I know because I've done it thousands of times.' Prof Kelly added that the guidance endorses cutting down on smoking with the help of licensed nicotine products such as patches and gum to help reduce the harm caused by tobacco. One in five adults in England smoke, and around two thirds of people who smoke say they'd like to quit . He pointed out that while nicotine is a 'relatively harmless' substance, there is a lack of clarity over the safety of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and what substance actually causes death. 'Put simply, people smoke for the nicotine but die because of the tar in tobacco. 'However, smoking tobacco is highly addictive, which is why people find it so difficult to stop smoking,' he said. Professor Paul Aveyard, Nice guidance developer, GP and Professor of Behavioural Medicine at the University of Oxford, said the guidance gives him another option to present to patients - and highlighted the safety and usefulness of NRT. He said when someone smokes cigarettes combined with NRT they are more likely to stop smoking. There is no evidence the combination of smoking and using NRT is harmful, he said. E-cigarettes are an increasingly popular NRT option . but they are controversial because they have not yet been licensed as safe and . effective by drug watchdogs. The devices provide a nicotine ‘hit’ to the user without the tar but there are fears they may pose a different health hazard. But the guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  says doctors seeking to help smokers can advise ‘these products are likely to be less harmful than cigarettes’. Professor Aveyard said he will tell patients that using e-cigarettes is ‘better than smoking.' ‘The safest thing is to use licensed nicotine replacement products - but a lot of people don’t want to use nicotine gum’ he added. The cost to the NHS in England of treating smoking-related illnesses is an estimated £2.7 billion a year . Concern has been raised that propellants used to produce the vapours from e-cigarettes may be potentially harmful. The UK watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency is currently producing guidelines which are expected shortly. The latest Nice guidance says nicotine replacement therapy, which includes patches and gum, can be safely used even when the patient continues to smoke. Nicotine Replacement therapies such as patches are now endorsed as a healthy alternative . There is no possibility patients will overdose on nicotine, which is a ‘relatively harmless substance’, it says. Prof Aveyard said when someone . smokes cigarettes combined with NRT (Nicotine Replacement Therapy) they . are more likely to stop smoking and smokers who eventually want to quit . should start using them. He . said ‘Advisors should reassure people that licensed nicotine-containing . products are a safe and effective way of reducing the harm from . cigarettes, and that NRT products have been shown in trials to be safe . for at least five years’ use. ‘Experts believe that lifetime use of these products will be considerably less harmful than smoking.’ Professor Linda Bauld, chairwoman of the Nice guidance development group, and Professor of Health Policy at the University of Stirling, said ‘The cost to the NHS in England of treating smoking-related illnesses is an estimated £2.7 billion a year. ‘One in five adults in England smoke, and around two thirds of people who smoke say they’d like to quit.’ Prof Bauld said people tend to under-use NRT products for fear they are unsafe or bad for their health, but said ‘You can continue to use clean nicotine for quite some time.” Electronic cigarettes were not included in the guidance as they are not a licensed nicotine product and have no ‘guarantees’, Prof Kelly said. Dan Griffin, a smoker of 25 years, said electronic cigarettes ‘present a good opportunity for people to quit smoking’. Mr Griffin said he has spent in excess of £20,000 on cigarettes and said some people might argue that smoking is ‘as sensible as putting your fingers in a toaster’. Mr Griffin has tried various methods to quit smoking including nicotine gum, hypnosis and going cold turkey. ‘I think this new guidance is going to be particularly helpful ‘he said.","National Institute of Health and Care Excellence issued the landmark advice .

"By . Robert Verkaik . Lord Prescott is at the centre of a £75million legal case over allegations that he tried to undermine coal miners’ compensation claims – because he feared Labour could lose union donations. Court papers seen by The Mail on Sunday allege the former deputy prime minister colluded with a major law firm to put pressure on an insurance company to refuse to underwrite the miners’ legal bills – forcing them to drop their action. Fear: It is claimed the former deputy prime minister feared union pay outs could cripple the Labour's income . The papers claim that if the miners had succeeded, the unions and their law firms faced having to pay out crippling multi-million pound settlements, potentially hitting union donations to the Labour Party. The miners were hoping to sue more than 50 law firms used by their unions that had been found by legal watchdogs to have improperly deducted millions of pounds from compensation payments they had won for lung and other diseases. In the new case, it is alleged that in 2006 Lord Prescott, in collusion with Thompsons Solicitors, threatened an executive at insurance firm Templeton. Compensation: The group aimed to sue 50 law firms used by their unions found to have smuggled millions . He told him to remove its offer of insurance to the miners or his company would face an investigation by the City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, it is claimed. Lord Prescott denies the allegations and says his private phone records show that no phone call was made to the executive. Thompsons also denies that the law firm ‘asked or procured Lord Prescott to do its “bidding” and say they ‘did not invite or pressure Templeton to act unlawfully’. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Court papers allege former deputy PM colluded with a law firm to put pressure on miners and insurance companies to drop legal action .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . As you take in a beautiful sunset, look over breathtaking landscapes or want to capture the intensity of a crowd at a gig it can be a hassle having to spend time rotating your phone - and yourself - painfully slowly in a circle to capture panoramic views, but all that is about to change. The Theta camera from Japanese firm Ricoh is the world's first handheld camera that takes fully spherical photos with just one shot. It can be held up to any scene, and once the shutter button is pressed, the camera's 'ultra-slim twin-lens optical system' snaps the view from around, above and below the device automatically - creating seamless panoramas. The Theta camera from Japanese firm Ricoh is the world's first handheld camera that takes fully spherical scenes, such as the examples pictured, with one shot. Its twin-lens system captures a scene around, above and below the device at the press of a button . Ricoh unveiled the device at the IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin. It weighs 95g and fits comfortably in the palm of a hand, similar to a remote control. The shutter button is positioned below the lens making it easy to take the photo using a thumb, and this reduces any shakiness caused by having to move fingers around the device to take the shot. There isn't a viewing display on the device itself, instead, every image taken is automatically synced with paired smartphones and tablets wirelessly and can be rotated and zoomed into on the mobile screen. Ricoh Theta weighs 95g and fits comfortably in the palm of a hand, similar to a remote control. This means it is portable and can be used indoors and out.

"By . John Hall . Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe is to boycott a meeting of African and EU leaders after his wife, who is famous for her lavish shopping sprees in Europe, was denied a European visa. A foreign ministry official said the Zimbabwe leader, 90, would not be attending a mammoth EU-Africa summit in Brussels next week due to a 'disagreement on the composition of our delegation'. Mugabe and his wife Grace, 48, remain targeted by an . Europe-wide travel ban but the restriction can be suspended temporarily to allow . the head of state to attend international forums. Refusal: Robert Mugabe (left) said he will boycott a meeting of African and EU leaders after his wife Grace (right) - who is famous for her lavish shopping sprees in Europe - was denied a European visa . Zimbabwe had earlier urged the African Union as a whole to boycott the summit after the EU refused to lift a ban on Grace Mugabe joining her husband's delegation. Mrs Mugabe is famous for the shopping trips to Europe she would make before being placed under sanctions, and is often referred to as the First Shopper, rather than First Lady, at home in Zimbabwe. As part of their plea for the African Union to shun the summit, Zimbabwe also complained about which politicians and heads of state had and hadn't been invited by the EU. Foreign ministry spokesman Joey Bimha said the European Union had not invited Sudan and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic - a country that does not have international recognition. Although the EU has refused to . invite Sudan, a Brussels official said the African Union was free to . independently invite its president, Omar al-Bashir. Expense: Grace Mugabe (pictured right, alongside her husband) is famous for her expensive trips to Europe. She is often referred to as the First Shopper rather than First Lady at home in Zimbabwe . The EU said AU chairman Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz (left) was free to independently invite Sudan's president Omar al-Bashir (right), despite the latter being wanted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide . Bashir . is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, crimes . against humanity and genocide related to the conflict in the Darfur . region of Sudan. Zimbabwe also complained that Egypt had been invited to the meeting after the country was suspended from the African Union following last year's coup that saw The Muslim Brotherhood and President Mohammed Morsi ousted from power. But diplomats in Brussels said they were confident there is 'no risk' of a pullout, despite Mugabe being named one of two African Union deputy chairmen in January, and Zimbabwe chairing the union next year - therefore leaving the country with more potential influence than usual. The current chair of the African Union is Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz. 'We have been discussing this for some . time. We have reached agreement and Zimbabwe has been invited but no . spouses have been invited,' the EU official said. The . EU ambassador to Harare, Aldo Dell'Ariccia, said Mrs Mugabe was told . she should 'apply through the normal channels' when her request to . accompany her husband was rejected. 'The EU is just following its legal framework and there can't be any movement from that position,' he added. Power: In January Mugabe was named one of two African Union deputy chairmen, while next year Zimbabwe will chair the African Union. Both these factors leave the country with more potential influence than usual . A spokesman for Robert Mugabe said it was 'very strange' that the EU had decided not to allow his wife to attend the the April 2-3 summit, which gathers 90 nations from both continents, including 65 heads of state and government. Speaking to the state-owned Herald newspaper, George Charamba added: 'What God has put together the EU is trying to separate... Do they expect the President to respect the EU and disrespect his own marriage?' Rushweat Mukundu of the political . think-tank Zimbabwe Democracy Institute said the row is just 'a symptom . of poisoned relations' between Zimbabwe and the EU, 'and old wounds that . are proving difficult to heal.' Both sides should have taken 'a sober approach' to resolving their long standing differences, suggested Mukundu.","The EU has barred Grace Mugabe, 48, joining her husband on Brussels trip .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Google is set to track the world's warships and make the data available to billions of internet users, raising concerns over the security of the American naval fleet. The search engine plans to offer the coordinates and identity of virtually all vessels at sea on Google Maps after spending around $3million on satellite technology. The company continues to consult with the U.S. Navy over the plans, as well as with the defence departments of countries around the world. Google has claimed that it is better placed to track the military boats than most governments. Ship-shape: Google will soon be able to show the location of every vessel at sea and maps of the ocean floor . Michael Jones, who is chief technology advocate at Google Ventures, told Aol: 'I watch them and they can't see themselves. It angers me as a citizen that I can do this and the entire DoD can't.' Google is not the first to track ships at sea, but claims to have improved on previous technology. All large vessels are fitted with the Maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS) - a series of transponders that transmit the boat's position to avoid collisions when it is dark or there is bad weather. At the moment AIS can detect boats 20 mile away from each other - however, there are ongoing attempts to improve the distance and accuracy. By comparison, from space the Google satellites can detect ships anywhere. The web power has already used its technology to track trawlers fishing illegally in foreign waters and passed the information on to governments. Despite fears over a risk to defence ships, the vessels can go incognito by simply turning off their transmitter so military operations were unlikely to threatened. All at sea: Internet users will be able to locate the coordinates and identity of the U.S. Navy's fleet via a simple Google search . Detractors of Google's plan to map the waters said the technology could be used by terrorists or pirates to attack ships. However one military source responded: 'It's not the ships you can see, but the ships you can't see that matter.' Google's plan to map the ocean floor over the next five years could reveal the resting place of spy satellites and send hostile foreign enemies on the hunt for 'sunken treasure'. It's not the ships you can see, but the ships you can't see that matter. Military source . Google Maps was launched in 2005, providing aerial or satellite images for most populated areas across the world. The service has often been controversial. Iran threatened to sue the company yesterday over dropping the name of the Persian Gulf on Google Maps. The threat came after it left the body of water between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula nameless on its online map service. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said that if Google does not restore the name of the Persian Gulf, it will face 'serious damages'. Into the deep: Google has said its capabilities of tracking naval vessels outstrips defense departments . Google reacted to the comments, saying that its maps service had never labelled the Persian Gulf. When asked by MailOnline if Google planned to include the title in the wake of Iranian threats, a spokesman said there were no plans to include the title on any amended map. A separate company insider told Mail Online that it was 'definitely not' a political decision not to have Persian Gulf on Google maps, and Iran's assertion that Google had had the label removed was 'simply wrong'. Iranians are highly sensitive about the name of the body of water, which has historically and internationally been known as the Persian Gulf. Some Arab states insist on calling it the Arabian Gulf. The issue has stirred up tensions between Iranians and Arabs .","Search engine has plans to map the entire ocean floor over next five years .

"By . James  Nye . A Delaware lawyer has declared he is willing to starve himself to death in front of the Supreme Court unless he gets national recognition for his campaign to stop employers firing staff because of embarrassing or controversial social media posts. Brian Zulberti, 31, who is on the fifth day of his hunger strike in Washington D.C., is currently camped out in front of the court sitting on a sun lounger with an umbrella to protect himself from the sun. The Villanova law school graduate wants a 90 second slot on a national television news network to gain exposure for his fight to legally separate the personal and professional lives of US citizens - and he claims he is willing to die on the sidewalk of the capitol if he doesn't get it. Protest: Brian Zulberti outside the US Supreme Court in May - where he is currently conducting a hunger strike that will not cease unless he gains 90 seconds of national television news coverage . Zulberti, who achieved a level of notoriety last year for circulating emails to hundreds of law firms with a photo of himself in a t-shirt showing off his biceps in an effort to get a job, is no stranger to social media fouls. He followed that up by posting a Facebook photo of himself shirtless while holding up a sign that read 'Hire Me! No…as a lawyer, damn, not an escort…wait is it something I’m wearing?' He has said he was also fired as a high-school tennis coach for comments he made online about an opposing player and when media checked his open Facebook profile after his unusual attempt to get hired last year they found several near-naked photographs. However, Zulberti does not think any of this should interfere with his or anyone else's career. 'We have Americans being fired everyday from coast to coast in almost every single state for simply doing completely legal things like having a beer after work or expressing an opinion that just doesn't happen to fly with the boss,' said Zuberti to WUSA9.com . Zulberti, wants laws that legally prevent any employers from firing their staff for social media content or opinions. 'I believe that every single American has the right to be off the clock,' said Zulberti, who graduated with a degree in social media law, to WUSA9.com . 'I don't believe that anyone should feel that they live in a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week job interview. 'I don't believe that anyone should be told that they're the face of a company at 4 a.m. on a dance floor,' said Zulberti.' Welcome to the gun show: Last year Brian Zulberti attached this photo (left) of himself to job search emails that he sent to hundreds of attorneys across Delaware and his public Facebook page revealed this (right) baffling job solicitation as well - which led to his application and profile being shared online . Zulberti is carrying a sign that has a tally of how many days into his hunger strike he is and is constantly updating his Facebook page as to his protest's progress. 'Hunger Strike Update- 12:48 AM (3 days, 4 hours, and 49 minutes into my Hunger Strike)' wrote Zulberti. 'This really has been a hellish evening. My sign was ruined by the rain. I'm huddled under this umbrella making it very difficult to work. 'Water keeps getting on my Macbook and creeping close to the generators. And I'm exhausted. Someone shoot me.' Earlier on Wednesday night, Zulberti admitted the smell of his clothes after three days without changing had become too much and said he was going to change - but not to eat. Fiery: Brian Zulberti's Facebook profile page is filled with humorous pictures he has photo-shopped his half-naked picture onto . Discrimination: The law graduate wants the Supreme Court to prohibit employers from firing staff for ill-judged social media posts . 'I want to be very clear about this. I am leaving the Supreme Court for a bout 60-90 minutes to go back to the Hotel Helix and take a shower and shave and change my clothes,' posted Zulberti to Facebook. 'Honestly, I know it's disgusting but I'm starting to smell after three entire days in the sweltering heat and no shower. 'And I want to brush my teeth. My teeth feel nasty. I don't like being unclean and its embarrassing when people take pictures with me and I stink.' Claiming that America is sleeping walking into an Orwellian dystopia unless it faces facts on social media, Zulberti says he has more public support than has been acknowledged. 'A dirty little secret is that the majority of America doesn't see me as an outsider or a wierdo, but as a man willing to speak truth directly in the face of a foolhardy status quo,' wrote Zulberti to his Facebook page on Wednesday. Freedom: The social media law graduate wants the professional and private lives of citizens to be firmly established in law . Selfie: Brian Zulberti wants all social media posts to exist separately and be protected from employer's eyes . His mantra is 'Coverage or Death' and Zulberti admits that his particular method of drawing attention to this issue will split opinion among the media. 'I'm not going to lie. It feels good to draw publicity to a cause I've been fighting for and dedicating my life to,' wrote Zulberti on Tuesday. 'But I admit to also taking sick personal satisfaction in getting the coverage I knew I'd get... directly in the face of so many people who said no one would care about me or my message.' Zulberti, who lists himself as self-employed at his own blog www.brianzulberti.net has been traveling the country to raise awareness of those fired because of their social media updates or postings. Hammer blow: Zulberti has declared he will not stop his hunger strike unless he gets the exposure he wants . He was recently in New Jersey to discuss the case of Sam Falcetano, who worked for the Department of Public Works and was fired for writing homophobic posts. Zulberti, who told The Washington Post he is 'about as gay as the day is long', said he disagrees with the man, but does not think he should have been fired. Indeed, Zulberti is adamant his message will be heard. Dismissing an interview with The Washington Post as not high-profile enough, Zulberti said he wants national television exposure. Only that will stop him from continuing his hunger strike. 'I want a major TV network,' he told The Washington Post. 'I want 90 second spot on a major network during prime time. Yes, if you were from CNN and you said Anderson Cooper will air you tonight, I would pack up my signs and leave. Mission accomplished.'","Law graduate Brian Zulberti, 31, is staging a protest outside the Supreme Court in Washington D.C.

"By . Jennifer Newton . A vintage Aston Martin which is thought to be the inspiration behind the gadget loaded car created for James Bond is up for sale. The Aston Martin DB 2/4 is set to fetch as much as £250,000 when it goes under the hammer at a Coys auction at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire on July 12. The car was off the road and collecting dust when a father and son team bought it and restored it to its former glory. The Aston Martin DB 2/4, the inspiration behind James Bond's famous car, which is set to be auctioned . The car is said to have inspired the Aston Martin DB5, which features in the Goldfinger movie starring Sean Connery as James Bond, pictured . It was during this restoration that the car’s links with 007 and Bond creator Ian Fleming came to light as the Aston Martin DB5, which features in the 1964 film Goldfinger was based on this very car. This is due to the car’s special one-off features, which include reinforced steel bumpers, a heavy-duty anti-interference system and a driver’s seat connection for a two-way radio or homing device. In addition there is also a device, which accurately computes time and distance in relation to a pre-selected average speed. The current owner is thought to live in Deal, Kent, and is said to have bought the car last year from a man who explained its only claim to fame was that it had ‘once been driven in a rally’. The car, pictured before it was restored, was bought last year by a father and son team from Kent, who brought it back to its former glory . The interior of the car, which boasts several special features, including a device, which accurately computes time and distance in relation to a pre-selected average speed . But when it was stripped down to be restored its links to James Bond and the spy’s creator Mr Fleming came to light. It was found that the car once belonged to Philip Ingram Cunliffe-Lister, head of MI5 during the Second World War. It is thought Mr Cunliffe-Lister used to visit Deal often with his wife to see Royal portrait painter Dennis Ramsay, who lived near Mr Fleming. Bond creator Ian Fleming lived next door to the friend of the car's former owner, Philip Ingram Cunliffe-Lister, head of MI5 during the Second World War . The Aston Martin has remained a favourite car with James Bond. Here current Bond, Daniel Craig is pictured next to an Aston Martin in the latest 007 movie Skyfall . Coys managing partner Chris Routledge said: ‘The story around this car and its discovery is phenomenal. ‘It was owned by Philip Ingram Cunliffe-Lister, whose father was Lord Swinton, a close confidant of Winston Churchill and head of MI5 during the Second World War. ‘Moreover, the vehicle was regularly at Ian Fleming’s direct next-door neighbour in Kent, and indeed it was the next-door neighbour’s house which was also used as inspiration in the Bond novels, this time as Drax’s residence in the novel Moonraker.’ The Aston Martin DB 2/4 went into production from 1953 until 1957, and a total of 764 were produced. The car came with a 2.9 litre engine, had a top speed of 118.5 mph and could go from 0-60 mph in 10.5 seconds. At its peak, the DB2/4 was being produced at the rate of six or seven a week even though it was strictly a hand built car.","Vintage Aston Martin 2/4 is set to fetch as much as £250,000 at auction .

"By . Alison Smith-squire . As they shop for clothes, Victoria and Treva Askey look like two friends simply enjoying a day out shopping. But Treva, 41, used to be a very macho man called Trevor.  A former soldier in the army’s Royal Engineers, he once served in war-torn Bosnia and the Falklands. And before Trevor became a woman, he married Victoria in a white wedding. Yet today, despite Trevor’s transition to the feminine Treva – she is already taking hormones and has grown B-cup breasts - the couple claim they are happier than ever together. The happy couple: Despite the changes, Victoria and Treva Askey say they are happier than ever together . They have no plans to divorce. In fact, mother-of-three Victoria, 39, who refers to Treva as ‘she’, is helping her to live as a woman. 'With Treva, I have the best of both worlds,' said Victoria. 'She is still the love of my life, the same person inside, but now I also have a best friend who I can talk about make up and clothes with. 'Of course I was absolutely shocked when she first told me. But now we are both going through the journey of her sex change together. I am as thrilled as she is to see her developing breasts and a new figure.' And Treva, who out of desperation to become a woman once took Victoria’s contraceptive pills, said: 'Telling Victoria I wanted to change sex was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. It is such a relief that she is standing by me.' White wedding: Trevor and Victoria on their wedding day. Victoria is now helping Treva to live as a woman . Today Victoria and Treva even share a wardrobe. 'We both have a huge passion for shoes,' says Victoria. We often swap clothes – we have the same tastes. We both love casual clothes although Treva is more girly than me. She prefers to wear full make up every day and always has her nails perfectly manicured.' And Treva has even undergone plastic surgery to make herself look even more feminine. 'Telling Victoria I wanted to change sex was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. It is such a relief that she is standing by me' - Treva Askey . The pair took out a £4,500 loan before Treva underwent plastic surgery to make her nose smaller. Brow surgery at a cost of £3,500 to make Treva’s forehead less prominent is also planned. Victoria was just 13 when she first met Trevor, 15, at school. Then, there were no signs that Trevor was anything but masculine. 'Trevor was known as a tough bloke who everyone looked up to and no-one would cross,' she says. 'I developed quite a crush on him and for a few weeks we had a typical teenage romance with a few stolen kisses.' But within a few weeks Trevor had disappeared. In fact he’d gone to serve in the Royal Engineers, where over the next 23 years he became a Lance Corporal, fighting in Bosnia, Kenya and the Falklands. During the next two decades the pair kept in touch – but as Trevor was in the army, they went their separate ways. 'During these years I married and had my first son, now aged 21,' recalls Victoria. Transition: Treva has undergone plastic surgery to make herself look more feminine. Victoria also helps with her make-up . 'And when that marriage ended I met someone else and went on to have two more children now aged ten and six. Meanwhile, Trevor also had various girlfriends and when aged 24, also married.' But the couple never forgot one another. 'Trevor would suddenly ring out of the blue and when he was back on leave, we’d sometimes meet up,' she says. 'Sometimes years went by when we didn’t see one another. But when we did the attraction was always incredibly strong – but nothing happened because each time one of us was with someone else.' However, in September 2006 Victoria suddenly got an email from Trevor that rocked her world – confiding he wanted to become a woman. Brave: Former soldier Trevor served in war-torn Bosnia (pictured) and the Falklands . Victoria emailed back to ask if he was joking. 'But when he sent me photos of painted nails, I knew it was for real.' Treva said: 'Ever since I was a teenager I’d always felt something wasn’t right because I didn’t seem to fit with men or women but in those days there was no information about men who wanted to become women.  So I kept any feelings to myself – there was no way I could have confided them at the time to any army colleagues. 'We both have a huge passion for shoes. We often swap clothes - we have the same tastes' - Victoria Askey . 'I’d always had a secret stash of women’s clothes. My wife had no idea but when she went out I’d sometimes dress up in them and just sit around the house. 'In hindsight it was the only time I felt truly comfortable. After that shocking revelation the emails between Victoria and Trevor dwindled and for three years they lost contact. Treva admits she worried the revelation had ruined her relationship with Victoria forever. But by May 2010 Trevor’s 15-year marriage had ended and when he emailed Victoria out of the blue Victoria’s relationship with her youngest children’s father was also on the rocks. Treva said: 'I’d never been able to get Victoria out of my mind and she’d always been the one person I could confide in.' Victoria recalls despite his revelation a few years earlier, she was thrilled to be back in touch with Trevor. 'Talking with him I realised it didn’t matter he still wanted to be a woman. He was my first love, a soulmate. I’d never forgotten him.' Service: Trevor served in the Royal Engineers over 23 years, during which time he became a Lance Corporal . Shortly after Victoria’s partner moved out and she started dating Trevor. On New Year's Eve, 2011, Victoria made him up for the first time as a woman. 'It was a very intimate moment and I proposed,' she said. 'Years ago Trevor had asked me to marry him but I turned him down because I’d only just come out of my first marriage. Now the time was right. I was delighted when he accepted.' Within six months she moved with the children to live near Trevor, who was still living as a man at his army base in Water Beach, Cambridgeshire. The pair were married in a small registry office in September 2011. 'On our wedding day Trevor was still as a man – and we made love as man and wife. No-one knew our secret but I already knew that I’d support him through his transition.' Shortly after Trevor retired from the army and for the first time began dressing as a woman full time. She said: 'I could immediately see how much happier Trevor was as a woman. As a man he was a typical quiet reserved British man but as Treva she was much more outgoing, chatty and relaxed.' The first step for Treva’s transformation was to get rid of her body hair. 'That took a whole day,' admits Victoria. 'And she began taking my contraceptive pills, which I’d researched on the internet could help male to female transsexuals. The female hormones helped her start to grow breasts, softened her skin and thickened her hair.' 'Talking with him I realised it didn’t . matter he still wanted to be a woman. He was my first love, a soulmate. I’d never forgotten him' - Victoria Askey . Then the pair went shopping with Victoria helping Treva choose clothes to flatter her slim 5ft 7in figure, and helping her apply make up. Meanwhile, the couple visited the children’s school to tell teachers about Treva. 'We were honest with the children – we simply told them that Trevor felt he was a woman trapped in a man’s body and was going to now live as a woman. 'The school have been completely supportive and the children, who still regularly see their dad who has remarried, have accepted Treva,' she says. Despite this, Victoria admits she and Treva do sometimes get some odd looks and stares when they go out together. 'We decided it was because some of Treva’s facial features were still quite masculine. 'She had a large nose for a woman and we both decided her nose would look more feminine if she had cosmetic surgery to make it smaller.' Happy together: Treva admits she worried the revelation had ruined her relationship with Victoria forever . Today, instead of the pill, Treva now takes women’s hormones, which Victoria has sourced online. As well as breasts she has a more womanly shape with hips and a smaller waist,' she says. Treva now hopes to undergo surgery to create bigger breasts and to be accepted onto the NHS waiting list for gender reassignment surgery. The couple admit many friends and family were initially shocked. 'Trevor was the last man anyone would ever imagine would want to become a woman,' says Victoria, 'but now people have got to know Treva, they are more understanding and in fact some of our friends are old army colleagues. 'They still call Treva her old army nickname – Arthur Askey – but no-one bats an eyelid now.' The pair plan to stay married. Victoria, who has written a book about their journey to help others, reveals: 'To me she is the same wonderful person. In fact we are happier than ever together. Trevor becoming Treva has only brought us closer.'","Treva - who used to be Trevor - was in the army for 23 years .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Britain's small birds are under threat from a flamboyant invader. Ring-necked parakeets, known for their acid green colour, large size and loud squawking, are frightening away small garden birds such as blue tits and blackbirds, causing them to eat less. A study in journal Behavioural Ecology found the Himalayan parakeets are spreading across south-east England and beyond, with a 'significant' impact on the foraging habits of garden birds. A study found ring-necked parakeets, known for their acid green colour, large size and loud squawking, are frightening away small garden birds . Academics at Imperial College London, the Zoological Society of London and the Natural History Museum monitored the feeding of garden birds, finding they ate less in the presence of the dominant, gregarious parakeets – and stayed away if they saw them. It is thought this is the first case of a non-native bird having such an effect. Researcher Hannah Peck said: 'We found they put off other birds from feeding. We don't know what the long-term impact of that will be, but there is a negative effect going on. Parakeets feed from a bird feeder in a domestic back garden in Charshalton Beeches in London . 'It could be that the other birds are being displaced, or it could be they are not getting much food, full stop.' There are estimated to be 50,000 ring-necked parakeets in Britain.","Study found Himalayan parakeets are spreading across south-east .

"By . Emily Crane . The mother of an 11-year-old boy beaten to death by his father at cricket training has spoken of her devastation of trying to rebuild a life without her son. Luke Batty was killed with a cricket bat and knife when his deranged father Greg Anderson attacked him in the Melbourne suburb of Tyabb in February. His mum, Rosie Batty, has now recalled the anger she felt after being told 'you'll always be a mum, Rosie' by someone trying to comfort her following Luke's murder, which occurred just metres from where she and other children were standing. Scroll down for video . Rosie Batty's 11-year-old son Luke was killed when his deranged father Greg Anderson attacked him in the Melbourne suburb of Tyabb in February . 'I was angry. I said ""I'm not a bloody mother anymore. I have a memory but I'm not"",' she told The Age. The 11-year-old was beaten to death at a cricket training ground just metres from where his mother and other children were standing . 'I have to rebuild a life with some direction and meaning because I'm not a mother anymore and all the things I did with Luke, either for him, or with him or because of him, it's all gone.' The home Ms Batty shared with Luke is a constant reminder of a future without her son – there's a swimming pool, cubby house, donkeys, goats, sheep and three dogs. Since Luke's death in February, Ms Batty has used the media spotlight surrounding his murder to campaign against family violence. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Ken Lay said Ms Batty didn't want Luke's death to be wasted. 'She has put this very much on the community's agenda and all power to her for doing so. This system sometimes moves very slowly but I have no doubt at all that her courage and willingness to speak out will put us in a far better place,' he said. The Victorian Government announced an additional $30 million to tackle family violence last week and Mr Lay said it was part of the 'Rosie Batty factor'. Ms Batty had sought intervention orders against Luke's father after realising she was in a violent relationship. Since Luke's death in February, Ms Batty has used the media spotlight surrounding his murder to campaign against family violence . In mid-2012, Anderson physically assaulted Ms Batty and in January last year he threatened to kill her and chop her foot off. Anderson was only allowed to have contact with Luke at cricket and football training, which is where he subsequently attacked his son. He was fatally shot by police after he killing Luke. 'There has to be greater accountability with a breach of an intervention order,' Ms Batty said. While Mr Lay said intervention orders mostly work, some people would not be bound by court orders. 'We see some tragic examples of that all too regularly and in the last few months we've seen a number so we just need to make sure that we have processes in place that can address those really high-risk people and I'm not sure we have that at the moment,' he said.

"By . Mark Duell . We could have less than 17 years to live - thanks to climate change, Bob Geldof has warned. The 61-year-old Live Aid founder told young people at a conference in Johannesburg, South Africa, that there will be ‘a mass extinction event’ and admitted his generation had let down today’s youth. Speaking to delegates from 189 countries, the former Boomtown Rats singer said 'we may not get to 2030' and warned: ‘The next war will not be a World War One or a World War Two - it will be the end.’ Warning: Bob Geldof speaks at the One Young World summit at Soccer City in Johannesburg, South Africa . Concern: Mr Geldof warned of 'a mass extinction event' and that his generation has let down today's youth . Mr Geldof, who was speaking at the One Young World summit, said: ‘The world can decide in a fit of madness to kill itself. Sometimes progress may not be possible. We're in a very fraught time.’ As young people shouted and blew on vuvuzela instruments at the Soccer City stadium, Mr Geldof added that young people must ‘get serious’ about how they can help, reported the Daily Telegraph. He finished by telling delegates at the summit on Wednesday evening that he was sorry for being ‘bloody miserable’, adding that his advice would be to ‘just get on with it’. Scientists warned last month that the Earth is set for more heatwaves, floods, droughts and rising sea levels that could swamp coasts and islands as greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere.

Mr Geldof is pictured centre right, next to Sir Richard Branson . Summit: Astronaut Ron Garan (left) with Mr Geldof (centre) and Sir Richard Branson (right) at the event . But despite these dire predictions, they admitted global warming was likely to be more gradual than they previously thought and that world temperatures have barely changed in the past 15 years. 'The world can decide in a fit of madness to kill itself. Sometimes progress may not be possible. We're in a very fraught time' Bob Geldof . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated in its first report for six years that global warming is ‘unequivocal’ - and it is ‘95 per cent certain’ human activity is the ‘dominant’ cause. But others questioned the credibility of the predictions, pointing out that the IPCC’s research had signally failed to predict the ongoing ‘pause’ in rising world temperatures. Irishman Mr Geldof organised the Live Aid concert in 1985 in London and Philadelphia for the Ethiopian famine - and famously caused controversy by swearing at TV viewers to send money. Then in 2005 he staged the Live 8 concert series in South Africa and the G8 states - France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US, UK, Canada and Russia - to put pressure on the group to help Africa.","Geldof, 61 warns of 'mass extinction' and that 'we may not get to 2030'

"By . Sarah Bridge . Dorothy Ellis, 93, the last surviving widow of a soldier from the First World War, laid a wreath in memory of her late husband, Wilfred, who died in 1982, at a ceremony commemorating the Armistice in Staffordshire this morning. Wilfred Ellis survived being shot, gassed . and left for dead in the mud of northern France to return home to . eventually marry Dorothy, who was born three years after the end of the . war. His remarkable wartime experiences formed part of the inspiration for War Horse, the children's book by Michael Morpurgo which was made into an . award-winning play and then a Hollywood film, directed by Steven . Spielberg. Dorothy Ellis, the last surviving widow of a First World War soldier, lays a wreath at the Gallipoli Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Her husband, Wilfred, inspired the novel War Horse . Ellis, along with fellow soldiers Albert . Weeks and Arthur Budgett, used to meet up with writer Michael Morpurgo . in a pub in the village of Iddesleigh in Devon and tell him stories of what life had been . like in the trenches. Dorothy . Ellis said 'Michael Morpurgo was always a friend of ours and . Wilfred told him about the war - which he [Morpurgo] didn't know . anything about. But, also, we had a picture of a horse in our sitting . room and together with the information that Wilfred gave him, that was . the beginning of War Horse.' Mrs Ellis celebrated her 93rd birthday today but the mood was one of remembrance for her husband and soldiers who lost their lives in World War I and other conflicts . She added that the . two-minute silence observed on Remembrance Day 'meant a lot' to her . husband, . who had fought in the trenches. Being the inspiration for War Horse . meant that recent generations also learned about the horrors that Mr . Ellis and others went through in the First World War. Mr Ellis was born in Wimbledon, south-west London. He signed up aged 17 years and ten months. A . private in the Norfolk Regiment, Mr Ellis had survived the horror of . the Western Front. His pencil-written service record reveals he suffered . a leg wound in March 1918, was gassed in August and returned home in . time for Christmas. Senior members of the the armed forces lay wreaths watched by Mrs Ellis during Armistice Day commemorations today . After being shot in the ankle Ellis scrambled . from the mud of Flanders and was the last . aboard a wagon taking the wounded to hospital. The . shortage of troops meant he was soon thrust back onto the . front line. In the wake of a gas attack, and reeling from its effects, . his trench was overrun by the Germans. Yet his life was spared. Mrs Ellis later remembered: 'He must have been . terrified. He would rather have died than been taken prisoner.’ But fate . took an unusual twist. Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) prepares to take Joey into battle in this scene from the film War Horse, inspired by Wilfred Ellis' experiences as a soldier in the First World War . ‘One . of the German soldiers jumped down into the trench with a fixed . bayonet. He just looked at Wilfred. Later Wilfred told me he thought the . poor devil thought he wasn’t worth the effort of killing. ‘Eventually, he hobbled back to the British lines, although he said he had no idea how he did it. He had a strong faith.’ Mrs . Ellis says that, despite his leg injury, he was one of the best dancers . she knew. A trained violinist, he worked on the cruise ship RMS Empress . of Britain and in seaside resorts after the war. He moved to Devon in . the Thirties to be close to his sick father. It was there that he met . Dorothy. Michael Morpurgo's book War Horse was made into an acclaimed production at the National Theatre . Although they were unable to have their own children, they fostered twin girls, Pauline and Joan. ‘He was always cracking jokes, laughing and singing,’ said Mrs Ellis. ‘He had a beautiful voice.’ He rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, except to . Morpurgo. Mr Ellis, who later worked with his wife dealing antiques, died shortly before the novel was . published in 1982 and never knew the impact that the story of his early life would have on future generations. Writer and his inspiration: Author Michael . Morpurgo, left, was fascinated by the wartime memories of Mr Ellis, seen . above right in his uniform. They would form the basis of Morpurgo's . book . Mrs Ellis, who turned 93 today, stood alongside present-day army cadets at a ceremony marking the Armistice at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire this morning. Her niece, Pauline Smith, 59, . from Highbridge, Somerset, said: 'She is very proud of Wilfred and what . he did, and she has always felt that it was important that people, in . particular the young ones, should know what the soldiers went through. 'The . success of War Horse has helped tremendously with that. Wilfred of . course did not see the success it would have but we think he would have . been pleased as well.' The outdoor ceremony this morning took place a day after Remembrance Sunday was marked at the Cenotaph in central London with a two-minute silence and a march past by 10,000 veterans and civilians, alongside hundreds of similar ceremonies at home and abroad. This morning's event took place within the walls of the Armed Forces Memorial, which is designed to allow a shaft of sunlight to dissect its walls hitting the bronze wreath sculpture when the two minutes silence takes place.","Wilfred Ellis survived being shot, gassed and left for dead in France .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When Aaron Eleby saw a defenseless, fluffy puppy while out on patrol in Afghanistan the Special Forces soldier from New York knew he had to save it. Thanks to a charity helping animals in the war-torn country, and the heroic efforts of Eleby and his fellow servicemen, the seven-month-old puppy is now living in the U.S. Charity Nowzad was so quick with its part of the rescue mission that the dog, named Yakkul, beat Eleby back home by a week, meaning the pair could celebrate the holidays together. Rescue mission: Aaron Eleby cuddles puppy Yakkul at his base in Afghanistan . It cost $4,000 to bring the pup back to New York, but the soldier said when he looked the dog in the eyes he had no choice. 'We were at a place and those people . over there didn't really deserve to have any dogs in the first place,' Elbey told 10 ABC. 'He was literally looking up, like, ""What are you going to do man?"" ...  like ""What are you going to do . next? It's your call"",' he said. After taking the puppy back to base Elbey started raising the funds needed to bring him home. The soldier had to go away on a two-week mission but by the time he returned, the money had been raised thanks to the help of family, friends and the Steve Caporizzo's Pet Connection website. The next mission however was to get the puppy safely to Nowzad, which involved a two and half hour drive on dangerous roads. Dog duty: The soldier rescued the puppy after seeing the appalling way the puppy and other strays were being treated . Brave: Special forces soldier Eleby says the puppy had a military escort when he was driven to the Nowzad shelter . 'He actually had to drive with a . military escort because you drive around out there by yourself with a . dog they are going to be like ""Why are you doing this?"",' Elbey explained. The charity made the arrangements to fly Yakkul 6,000 miles to JFK airport in New York, where the puppy was met by Elbey's mother, who will look after the dog when her son is away on duty. But it was another week before he was reunited with the man who saved him. 'When I walked in and saw him, it was awesome. I'm not gonna say a tear came to my eye, but it was hiding back there,' Elbey said. The puppy has settled into life in the U.S. well, and has made friends with the family's other dog, Naja. Fresh start: Yakkul relaxed with the soldier's other dog, Naja, at his New York home . The soldier wrote online, next to a picture of his dogs: 'Took forever to get him home, he beat me back by a week. My parents are doing a great job with him ... and Naja is keeping him in line.' Yakkul's journey to the U.S. was helped by British animal charity Nowzad, which rescues stray dogs and cats in Afghanistan. As well as helping soldiers bring stray animals they have bonded with back to their home countries, the charity neuters and vaccinates stray animals and trains local vets.","Friends and family of Aaron Eleby helped raise $4,000 to save puppy .

"By . Nick Mcdermott . They are the backbone of church fetes, village fairs and jumble sales all around the country. But the thousands who regularly sell their home-made jam, marmalade or chutney in re-used jars may have to abandon their traditions after a warning that they are breaching European health and safety regulations. Legal advisers to Britain’s Churches have sent out a circular saying that while people can use jars for jam at home or to give to family and friends, they cannot sell them or even give them away as raffle prizes at a public event. Glass warfare: The Women's Institute is warning its 210,000 members about the European regulations . Take note: The written circular from the Churches' Legislation Advisory Service . The circular from the Churches’ Legislation Advisory Service, which is chaired by the Bishop of Exeter, . is pointedly headed: ‘Please take note: this looks like a spoof but it’s . not.’ The advisers say the . rules that are being breached are the snappily-titled EC Regulations . 1935/2004 and 2023/2006, which prevent containers being re-used unless . they are specifically designed for that purpose. The . Women’s Institute said it was offering similar advice on the re-use of . jam jars to its 210,000 members. A spokesman said the news could send ‘a . tremor through middle-England’ and the organisation was braced for a . flurry of inquiries. The . Food Standards Agency said the rules had been introduced because there . was a risk of chemicals leaching out of old containers and contaminating . food, though it added that  it was not aware that  re-used jam jars . were a safety hazard. 'Daft': The news will alarm a growing number of jam-makers . The agency said it was up to local authority environmental health officers to enforce the regulations, and penalties can reach a maximum of a £5,000  fine, six months’ imprisonment, or both. The news will alarm the growing number of jam-makers inspired by model Kate Moss, who makes damson jam out of fruit from her Cotswolds estate, and the Duchess of Cambridge, who keeps pots to give away  to friends. Mary Berry, the star of the BBC’s The Great British Bake Off, said: ‘This is absolutely stupid. It is just going too far. ‘We . are encouraging people to save money by using fruits  to make chutneys . and jam, and if they have to buy new jars it will become much too . expensive. It’s daft.’ The rules are also causing . consternation in churches that rely on the hundreds of thousands of . pounds raised from fetes and bazaars. The Rev Derek  Williams, a spokesman . for the diocese of Peterborough, said enforcing the rule ‘would be a . blow to fundraising events for all sorts of voluntary organisations’. He added: ‘It’s quite ridiculous, as . selling home-made jams and chutneys has always been a traditional and . important part of fundraising for church groups and others. ‘Older people in particular, or those not terribly well-off, have never been shy of making a few pots and giving that away. ‘People will offer their home-made jam when perhaps they can’t give anything else.’ 'This is not a spoof': Church advisers forced to point out 'stupid' rule to members . Mr . Williams said he had never heard of anyone falling ill from eating jam . from a re-used jar, adding: ‘There must be a sensible balance between . health and safety and something that has happened without incident for . centuries.’ Canon Michael . Tristran, of Portsmouth Cathedral, said: ‘On realising this was not a . belated April Fool’s joke, I was very anxious, not only from the . fundraising point of view for all our churches, but also because it goes . against the green agenda of recycling.’ The WI said anyone using old jars should sterilise them by washing them and drying them in an oven on a low heat.","Churches warn parishioners to stop selling preserves in re-used jars .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . He's working hard to maintain a respectable handicap of about 16 or 17, but President Obama is playing straight into the hands of his Republican rivals while doing so. The Leader of the Free World skipped the gym on Wednesday to hit the links at Mid Pacific Country Club golf course in Kailua’s Lanikai neighborhood with scenic views of the water and lush green mountains. The game came just days after the Republican National Committee designed six e-cards of mock presidential resolutions, posting aspirational messages alongside ironic images of Obama.

President Barack Obama picks up his ball on the 18th green at Mid-Pacific County Club in Kailua, Hawaii. The First Family will finish up their holiday on Sunday . Republicans captioned a snap of the President putting on the green while dressed to the nines in a suit and tie as part of a mock series of resolutions for 2014 . The headlining 'resolution' was to 'spend less time on the gold course', with the President playing an estimated 155 rounds since he assumed office in 2009. On Sunday, after playing nearly five hours of golf Sunday at Marine Corps Base, veteran White House reporter Keith Koffler from White House Dossier said his latest game was the 156th game since the inauguration and the 45th outing this year. Through the first 10 days of his end-of-the-year vacation in Hawaii, President Obama has largely fulfilled one goal: Staying out of the public eye. While his administration has sent out formal statements, and campaign organizations have e-mailed fundraising solicitations under his name, Obama has also gotten in daily workouts, hiking and beach trips, dinners with friends and family and six golf outings in his home state. Obama has also signed bills into law and conducted a series of briefings, all behind closed doors.

The motorcade of President Barack Obama leaves Lanikai after he played golf at the the Mid Pacific Country Club . Obama's vacation lasts until Sunday and the $4 million price tag that some news outlets have put on the stay has prompted some grumbling: The Hawaii Reporter notes that Obama and friends pay for the private vacation rental in Kailua that fetch $25,000 a week -- but that taxpayers pick up the majority of the bill for the rest of the trip. The website says Michael Tasselmyer of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, estimates the 18-hour round trip flight to Hawaii and back aboard Air Force One at $3,235,500. That's $179,750 per hour for flight and operation. The Reporter says the cost for cargo aircraft that transports the presidential limos, helicopters and other support equipment to Hawaii has never been disclosed, but the round trip flight time between Andrews Air Force Base and Hawaii is 21.5 hours, with an estimated operating cost of $12,000 per hour. The Obama's are generally warmly received in Hawaii, although demonstrators protested Saturday against unmanned drones in an area near the first family's vacation home.","President Obama skipped the gym on New Years Day to play a seventh game of golf on his two-week family vacation in Hawaii .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Can talking birds speak languages other than English? The answer is a resounding 'yes', highlighted in this video where a Common Hill Myna is seen chatting in Japanese. Called Abe Chan, the bird has become an internet sensation thanks to his grasp of the language, although whether it understands what it is saying remains to be seen. The video was uploaded by Satoko Ohno in Japan. In it, the bird can be seen responding to a phone call. Ohno then engages in conversation with the bird, showing off its surprisingly competent grasp of words and phases in Japanese. Bird: 'Um hello, this is the Ono family.' （Phone-call) Bird: 'What's wrong?' Owner: 'Abe-chan, you're a little too early. Once the phone's picked up, then properly say ""hello"".' Bird: 'Okay, understood.' Owner: 'Do you really understand? I'm counting on you. ""Hello, this is the Ono family residence in Gifu.""' Bird: 'Okay, I understand!' Owner: 'Got it.' On his website, Ohno says that he has had a few mishaps with the bird in the past. This includes Abe Chan jumping out of a window, leaving Ohno running around a residential area chanting his name. This particular species of bird it known as the Common Hill Myna. It is an animal of 'least concern' in terms of conservation according to the IUCN. The bird is known for its distinctive jet-black feathers in contrast to its orange beak and yellow markings on its head. They average about 12in (30 cm) in length. Its most notorious trait, however, is its ability to mimic a wide variety of noises. At dawn and dusk, when it is most vocal, it can be heard making a range of calls including whistles and screeches. The bird can even, as shown in the video, mimic the human voice with surprising accuracy. While it is unlikely they are aware what they are saying, the ability of the birds to clearly replicate a human voice is impressive, if slightly unnerving. Nonetheless, seeing a bird speak Japanese is certainly a rare and fascinating sight. Abe Chan, pictured, is a Common Hill Myna that was filmed showing its ability to talk Japanese .

The video shows David Lodge, 50, being hit by an oncoming motorist who veered into his path while driving along a main road in Kirkwhelpington, Northumberland. As the white car slams into his bike, debris is scattered onto the road while his wife Tracey, who was riding pillion at the time, was flown more than 30m into the air. Scroll down for video . David Lodge, 50, was on his motorbike near Kirkwhelpington, Northumberland when a motorist smashed into him.. On the right you can see his wife, Tracey, being propelled into the air after the impact . His bike lay shattered in pieces while he was being treated by paramedics . After the collision last August, Mr Lodge was left with a catalogue of horrific injuries including a broken spine, three fractured ribs, a . shattered foot, two cracked forearms, a punctured lung, multiple face . injuries and swelling to the brain. He was airlifted to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary and placed in an induced coma for more than 17 days, while his family were warned he may not survive. While he lay fighting for life, his wife received treatment in the same hospital. Mr Lodge, a taxi driver from Darlington, County Durham, has revealed he watches the terrifying footage captured by a nearby petrol station because he suffered a four-week window of amnesia after the crash. He said: 'There's nothing in my mind from the village before to four weeks after the accident. 'I watch it so I'm clear in my mind that there's nothing I could have done to stop. 'It's a reminder of what happened - because I have no memory I don't remember the pain or the hurt.

Among the horrific catalogue of injuries suffered by the father-of-one was a broken spine . The X-ray shows two metal plates that were put in his forearm (left) after it was broken . Pins were also placed in his foot, which was badly fractured as a result of the impact . 'They told my family it was an hour-by-hour situation, whether I was going to live and, if I did, whether I was going to be brain damaged or paralysed.' He added: 'Now I don't really feel any pain - it's like it never happened.' After receiving extensive treatment, Mr Lodges said he no longer feels any pain . The couple were making their way back from Aberdeen after a weekend visiting their daughter, Angela, 30, a sales manager at Lush, and her husband, Dieter, 29, a teacher. As they made their way along the A696 in Northumberland, on August 18 last year, Brazilian tourist Rodrigo Arozo Benicio Dos Santos pulled his car in front of their motorbike. Tracey, 50, was thrown nearly 30m (100ft) through the air and suffered a fractured wrist, a broken leg and foot. She had to make countless visits to the James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough after David was transferred nearer to their County Durham home to continue his recovery. She said: 'After the accident I was in shock. I think my brain just shut off - I don't remember lying on the road. I thought, 'We've been in an accident, we've come out OK'. 'I heard my husband shout, ""Get my helmet off"", and I thought he must be OK. 'But then we got to hospital and they said he was critical. I'm just so lucky he's alive.' Just days after the accident, Santos, 35, was fast-tracked through the courts. He was convicted of driving without due care and attention at Newcastle Crown Court in September, where he was given six penalty points and told to pay £1,400 in fines and costs. The court was told he had been holidaying in the UK and was travelling to Scotland during a tour of the country. He has since been deported. Mr Lodges added: 'The whole experience has been a nightmare. 'We've been biking for years and it's a major part of our lives but it's like someone has pressed the stop button and we are waiting for it to go again. 'We are both suffering the effects of the crash and have spent the past year coming to terms with what happened. 'As well as the physical pain from our injuries it also makes me sad to think of the rallies and events that we had previously planned to attend with friends on our bikes.'","David Hodge, 50, was on a motorbike near Kirkwhelpington, Northumberland .

"By . Ian Parkes . Lotus owner Gerard Lopez has urged Renault to name names in future the next time they attempt to drop teams in trouble. Renault Sport F1 president and managing director Jean-Michel Jalinier revealed last week at least one team had not paid their bill with regard to their supply of this season's power units. Jalinier admitted the late payments were 'a serious concern' and that the critical point was 'just weeks away'. Let's be clear! Lotus owner Gerard Lopez insists they've paid Renault for this season's power supply . With four teams as Renault customers - Red Bull, Toro Rosso, Lotus and Caterham - the belief at the time was that Jalinier could not be referring to the former two marques, given their resources in being backed by energy drinks billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz. The obvious deduction was Jalinier was pointing an accusing finger at Lotus and Caterham, both of whom are reputed to be struggling financially. Caterham team principal Cyril Abiteboul insisted his marque had paid up, leaving only Lotus as the sole team under suspicion. Following Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, Lopez was seen engaged in talks with Renault bosses in his team's motorhome at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona. Seemingly to clear the air, Lopez said: 'This is why we had a meeting, because I wanted them to clarify their price. 'I said to them if they are going to say things, then name the team that is an issue. 'Don't just say 'teams' and then expect people to make their own judgements. We respect the arrangements we have with them. 'If there is (somebody who has not paid), it must be somebody else, but I'm not even sure there is, to be honest with you, so we'll see.' Tricky time: Romain Grosjean has picked up just four points during this season's Formula 1 championship . Asked directly whether Lotus had paid up, Lopez replied: 'We've paid up. We're absolutely in line with them.' The situation, however, did not detract from Lotus' best result of a previously troubled season as the Enstone-based marque scored points for the first time this campaign. From a season-high fifth on the grid, Romain Grosjean finished eighth, dropping three places according to Lopez due to an electronic issue with the power unit for a couple of laps. Lopez had previously insisted Spain would effectively be the start of his team's season, and so it proved, and now he has high hopes. 'We've been saying from the beginning of the season we have a really good car, but it's been tough because of the foundations we had,' he said. 'In theory, we have a car that is behind Mercedes - well, everyone is behind Mercedes! - but closer to Red Bull, and then able to fight and beat pretty much any other car. 'This is one more step of confirmation, but only that, so we need to keep on pushing and working. 'But I think we will now have a normal season, which for us is being able to fight for being the third, fourth team (in the constructors' championship).'","Lotus owner Lopez wants Renault to name names if they're stirring trouble .

"By . Freya Noble . Dozens of Australian babies are infected by a virus that has no cure, doctors say. Professor Theo Sloots says 46 babies are currently infected with parechovirus, which has spread to Queensland. At least 11 cases have been confirmed in the state since December. 'The outbreak is Australia-wide now and we believe there are at least four types of the virus,' the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases (QPID) laboratory director told reporters in Brisbane. Dozens of Australian babies have become infected with an incurable virus . 'We don't know what type is in Queensland compared to other states.' Parechovirus is a respiratory and intestinal disease that causes fever, irritability, rash and diarrhoea. Severe cases can develop into hepatitis or encephalitis, and can also cause seizures. QPID Associate Professor Michael Nissen said the virus infected mainly infants, but no one was sure where it came from, how often it occurred or how to fight it. 'This virus does not respond to common antibiotics,' he said. But Prof Nissen said humans must have been able to fight it because it has been around for a long time - doctors just were not able to detect it. The QPID laboratory has recently developed a test to identify the virus in patients within a day. Doctors say outbreaks have already occurred at two Brisbane hospitals, as well as other parts of the country . 'It is important to diagnose the infection early and distinguish it from other possible causes,' Prof Nissen said. The next natural step would be developing a vaccine, but he said until then the best way for parents to avoid parechovirus was good hygiene around babies. This included washing hands after going to the toilet, before eating, after wiping noses and after changing nappies. 'It's really common-sense stuff,' Prof Nissen said. According to the ABC, the first case in Queensland was reported in the northern city of Bundaberg. Dr Leisha Callaghan from Brisbane's Royal Children's Hospital told the publication they have already experienced outbreaks at two major Brisbane hospitals. 'Viruses overall are generally often milder infections than bacterial infections, but this one can be pretty nasty,' she said. Doctors are looking to develop a vaccine but there is not much known about the long-term effects of the virus. 'But certainly when little babies contract the virus they are very sick when they present,' Dr Callaghan said. 'There's the risk of death and certainly long-term morbidity, with the possibility of significant brain damage.'","Parechovirus currently infecting 46 babies around Australia .

"By . Ashley Collman . and Jennifer Newton . After reliving September 11, 2001 all over again at the newly-opened 9/11 Museum, visitors can purchase stuffed animals, glass ornaments, World Trade Center-printed ties and other tasteless souvenirs at the gift shop, located just a few feet away from the final resting place of 8,000 unidentified remains of victims from the tragedy. And of the 140 tacky trinkets available on the store's website so the museum can cash in remotely, just 7.8 per cent are listed as being Made in the USA. The Lower Manhattan museum and corresponding gift shop have only been open to survivors and victims' families since Thursday, and so far these visitors have expressed outrage at souvenirs being marketed off the worst terrorist atrocity in U.S. history. Angered: Many 9/11 survivors and victims are upset that a gift shop is part of the new museum and memorial at the Ground Zero site . Accessories: The store offers a range of gifts like Josh Bach men's ties with the World Trade Center columns design and scarves in the same print . Something for Fido: The store even stocks gifts for the family dog, such as these police and firefighter vests in every size . Fashion statements: Women's scarves sport prints of the old New York skyline before the attacks, and a vintage print of the World Trade Center during lunch hour . Souvenir: Many of the items for sale come with a print of the World Trade Center columns, such as this decorative tray . According to the museum's website, the proceeds benefit 'developing and sustaining' the memorial which is run by executives with privately-funded six-figure salaries. There are many more trinkets available . for sale in the actual store, so the amount of American-made items may . be much less, but the museum has yet to respond to MailOnline's request . for a full list of products, and their place of manufacture. The idea of a gift shop alone is offensive to many, but is made even more painful considering 8,000 unidentified remains of victims were recently moved to a tomb beneath the museum. 'Here is essentially our tomb of the unknown. To sell baubles I find quite shocking and repugnant,' Diane Horning, who lost her 26-year-old son Matthew in the attacks, told the New York Post. Toys: While some parts of the museum are too graphic for young ones, there's still plenty of toys for kids in the gift shop . Symbol of survival: Mugs and t-shirts are printed with the image of the 'Survivor Tree', a pear tree that survived the buildings' collapse . Money holders: Several wallets are embossed with the 9/11 memorial insignia and even the World Trade Center columns . The usual products: Like many other NYC tourist destinations, FDNY and NYPD shirts are for sale along with toy squad cars and fire engines . Mugs, tote bags, and t-shirts are emblazoned with the words: 'I Love NY More Than Ever' Decked out: The store also sells jewelry such as these pendants molded off the Survivor Tree's leaves .

Matthew worked as a database administrator for Marsh & McLennan, an insurance firm which had offices in the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Matthew's remains were never recovered. 'I think it's a money-making venture to support inflated salaries, and they're willing to do it over my son's dead body,' Mrs Horning said. Joe Daniels, the memorial and museum's CEO, makes $378,000 a year, though his and other executives' six-figure salaries are funded through private donations. Still, the idea of a gift shop doesn't sit well with many close to the tragedy, who believe it could have been kept closed until Wednesday, when the museum opens to the public. President Obama dedicated the museum in a moving speech on Thursday, and the memorial has since only been open to survivors and victims' families. 'These people are suffering, and they don't need to be reaching into their pockets,' John Feal, a former Ground Zero demolition survivor, told the Post. 'The museum could have gone six days without asking for money.' However, Mr Feal, who runs the FealGood Foundation for ailing 9/11 workers, says he understands the museum's need to sell items in order to cover costs. The museum plans to operate on a $63million budget with money raised through admission fees and donations. President Barack Obama visited the museum on Thursday with first lady Michelle Obama. They were joined by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former president Bill Clinton . One of the exhibits in the 9/11 Memorial Museum. It shows the FDNY Ladder Company 3 fire engine, which was damaged when the North Tower collapsed .

'All net proceeds from our sales are dedicated to developing and sustaining the national September 11 Memorial & Museum,' the museum's website reads. 'Thank you for helping to build a lasting place for remembrance, reflection, and learning for years to come.' The gift shop itself was funded with a $5million donation from Paul Napoli and Marc Bern, partners in a law firm which made $200,0000 representing 10,000 Ground Zero workers in a lawsuit. That's $5million Mr Feal believes should have been donated to the 'sick and suffering - their former clients'.","Newly-opened National September 11 Memorial & Museum features gift shop .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . The attention of  people around the world was centred on Lewis Hamilton winning the Spanish Grand Prix, but Formula One's intrigue involved a British boffin with an H4 pencil. As so often, the real stories occur off the track. So it is in the case of Adrian Newey, Red Bull's peerless designer, whose services are being sought by Ferrari. Newey is thought to earn £7million a year at Red Bull, meaning that to sign him Ferrari's president Luca di Montezemolo would need to be the man that broke the bank at Maranello. That is something he would be willing to do. In demand: Ferrari are courting Red Bull's technical chief Adrian Newey in a bid to revive their fortunes . The Italian team are in an awful mess - one of their cars was lapped in Barcelona on Sunday - and the flamboyant Di Montezemolo is personally involved in sorting out the mess. He has already parted company with Stefano Domenicali as team principal and replaced him with Marco Mattiacci, an executive from America who has extremely limited sporting experience. There will be further changes throughout the team - 'we need defenders and midfielders, not just strikers,' as one respected Ferrari executive confessed - but the significance of signing Newey can hardly be overstated. He is, after all, the man behind 10 drivers' and 10 constructors' titles with  Williams, McLaren and Red Bull. Out of sorts: Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was lapped during Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix . But would Newey go? He was equivocal about the possibility when asked by Sky. 'I don't know,' he said. 'I need to think about it. We're in the middle of the season and I'm just getting on with it.' Asked again, he replied: 'At some point I am going to have to think about the future, but at the moment my focus is getting in front of the silver car (the Mercedes).' Christian Horner, his boss at Red Bull, was firmer but not conclusive when he responded by saying: 'It is an annual thing that there is speculation about Adrian's future but he has made his feelings clear to me about the team. In the pits: Ferrari chief Luca di Montezemolo salutes the Fernando Alonso faithful in Spain . 'He has paternal feelings towards the team and he is much more involved than he has been. The speculation is purely that. You can understand why Ferrari would be looking. Adrian has always enjoyed a challenge.' Newey, who still designs by hand on a sketch board, enjoys his life at Red Bull: the atmosphere is relaxed (but highly competitive), with a college-like air in his design department. It was that freedom, plus plenty of money, that convinced him to leave McLaren and its straitjacket approach to join the Milton Keynes factory and build four world championship-winning cars. Those working practices were sold to him by Horner over dinner at the Bluebird restaurant on Chelsea's King's Road. Red Bull are struggling this year but that is down to their under-powered Renault engines rather than Newey's chassis. There is no sign of any strain in relations between Newey and his team. It is more a matter of whether he is tempted to take on a new, perhaps final, challenge in  Formula One at the age of 55. Ferrari is alluring to anyone with racing in their soul.","Adrian Newey's services are sought by Ferrari chief Luca di Montezemolo .

"By . James  Nye . The body of tragic fashion designer L'Wren Scott was taken from a Manhattan funeral home on Sunday morning and flown to Los Angeles - where boyfriend Mick Jagger is making arrangements for her burial. Staff at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel on 81st Street and Madison Avenue took out the dark wooden coffin containing Scott at around 10am for her journey to Los Angeles. They carefully placed the coffin into the hearse along with a shipping box for its transfer to the Hollywood Forever Funeral Home and Cemetery - where actors such as Rudolph Valentino and Estelle Getty were buried. Scroll Down for Video . Solemn: The casket reportedly carrying the body of L'Wren Scott was moved from a New York City funeral home on Sunday morning to Los Angeles . The body of Scott has been at the Upper East Side funeral home since Wednesday - following her suicide on Monday morning. Tragic duty: Karis Jagger visits a Los Angeles mortuary to make arrangements for L'Wren Scott's funeral. Mick Jagger's eldest daughter was seen talking with staff at the mortuary as she toured their grounds . Scott, 49, who dated the Rolling Stones lead singer for around 13-years, took her own life inside her Chelsea apartment after her business had fallen $6 million in debt. Jagger, 70, was preparing to tour Australia when he heard the news and has been in Los Angeles with his family since Thursday with his children - including eldest daughter Karis - his daughter with model Marsha Hunt. Together the two have visited four memorial parks in Hollywood looking for a plot of land for Scott.The news comes after jewellery designer Jade Jagger arrived in the Californian city to be with her distraught father. The pregnant 42-year-old was spotted at London's Heathrow airport on Saturday making her way to the States to comfort Mick Jagger ahead of Scott's as yet-unscheduled funeral. The Rolling Stones frontman is believed to be staying at the house of his eldest daughter Karis, alongside three of his other children - Lizzie, Georgia May and James - who have rallied around comforting him. Jade, who is currently seven months pregnant, appeared to be showing the strain of the difficult past couple of weeks. The jewellery designer was joined by her husband Adrian Fillary, who carefully pushed all their luggage through the airport - and by the looks of the amount they have - they are planning an extended stay. Support: Jade Jagger and her husband Adrian Filliary were seen leaving London on Saturday to fly to Los Angeles . Watch Video Here: . Mick, 70, landed in LA last week after the Rolling Stones cancelled their planned Australian and New Zealand concerts following L'Wren Scott's death.

Moving: A coffin carrying the body of L'Wren Scott, pictured, was reportedly moved Sunday from a Manhattan funeral home to be flown to Los Angeles . Jagger's eldest daughter Karis, 43, lives in Los Angeles with her husband and two children, and her house is reportedly being used as the home base as she and her halfsisters have gathered there to comfort their father. Karis, who graduated from Yale in 1992, was raised early on by her mother, model Marsha Hunt who battled with Jagger until he admitted his paternity when Karis was 12-years-old. The pair have since built their relationship, particularly given his choice to take solace in her home. Jagger was in Perth on Monday night when news broke of his longtime partner's suicide in New York. His daughters Georgia May and Elizabeth- sisters whose mother is Mick's second wife Jerry Hall- flew to be with him immediately and accompanied him to California. The Rolling Stones plane refueled in Los Angeles before carrying on to England, but when it touched down in the U.K., Keith Richards was the only main band member on board. Jagger's spokesman has since confirmed that the rocker has stayed in California and now has most of his children- Karis, Jade, Elizabeth, Georgia May, and James- by his side. (The only ones absent are his youngest sons Gabriel and Lucas, who are 16 and 14 respectively. Watch Video Here: . Together: Karis, 43, is a Yale-educated mother of two and grew close to her father after he admitted paternity following a lengthy back-and-forth with her mother Marsha Hunt . The latest twist in the saga surrounding Scott's sudden suicide comes as her brother has reportedly agreed to allow Jagger to plan a West Coast funeral for her. The couple began dating in 2001 after meeting when she was a stylist on a photo shoot featuring the rock superstar. At the time, Scott had been living in Los Angeles and she maintained a home there in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood until 2009 when she sold the three-bedroom home for $860,000. 'I can’t help thinking, now, that a huge part of L’Wren’s spirit, what gave her grit and endurance, remained in the West. And without it, maybe she was maybe was a little lost, a little less sure of herself,' Scott's good friend Cathy Horyn, The New York Times fashion critic, wrote in a moving tribute to the designer. She went on to recall how Scott would host dinners at the house, including a memorable outdoor Thanksgiving dinner with a number of Jagger's bandmates and their significant others in the home's walled garden.

Some close friends of the designer- including actress Ellen Barkin- went to the apartment and reportedly spent time with the body before the medical examiner removed it from the apartment. Though spokesmen had confirmed the suicide hours after the body was found, the medical examiner ruled it as such on Wednesday. Her body was claimed on Thursday but the medical examiner could not release the name of the individual who arranged the transfer to the Frank E. Campbell funeral home on the Upper East Side. The funeral home, which regularly handles high-profile deaths like that of Jackie Kennedy and more recently Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is now reportedly coordinating a transfer of her body from New York to California after The New York Post revealed that her brother Randall Bambrough agreed to Jagger's wishes.","Employees at the Frank E.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Playboy magnate: Marc Leder, 50, the co-CEO of Sun Capital Partners, has become notorious for hosting wild parties in the Hamptons . A secretly taped video featuring Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney unfavorably sounding off on President Barack Obama’s supporters was recorded at the house of a playboy hedge fund manager who has gained notoriety for debauched sex parties, according to latest reports. Marc Leder, 50, the co-CEO of Sun Capital Partners in Boca Raton, Florida, hosted a fundraiser for the former governor of Massachusetts in May. During the exclusive $50,000-a-plate event, Romney was caught on video dismissing the 47 per cent of Americans who allegedly support President Obama as freeloaders who depend on the government. The leaked recording caused an uproar in the media following a report by the left-leaning newspaper Mother Jones on Monday, but it also shone a spotlight on the not-so-private life of the host of the now-infamous fundraiser. Leder, a divorced 50-year-old private equity honcho, made headlines last August after hosting what was described by the New York Post at the time as a wild end-of-the-season bacchanal in the Hamptons where guests were seen performing sex acts in public while scantily clad Russian women danced on platforms. According to the Post, Leder rented a palatial beachfront estate in the town of Bridgehampton for $500,000 a month in July of 2011, where he hosted parties every Friday and Saturday that had become the talk of the Hamptons, attracting celebrities like the hip-hop tycoon Russell Simmons and his ex-wife, Kimora Lee. The most outrageous of Leder’s society bashes took place on July 30, involving debauched guests skinny-dipping in the pool and men twirling torches to a throbbing techno soundtrack. Scroll down to watch the video . Scene of the crime: An aerial shot of Surfside Drive in Bridgehampton, New York, where Marc Leder rented a $500,000-a-month mansion that became the site of a wild bacchanal . At one point, a party-goer described as a ‘chubby white meathead’ and his ‘tanned’ female companion stripped down and jumped into the pool completely naked before moving to a lounge chair, where they proceeded to have sex in full view of their bewildered fellow guests. The 50-year-old tycoon, whose personal worth was estimated at 400million, capped off the year by throwing a series of parties called ‘Event Week 2011/2012’ at his estate on the island of St. Bart’s, according to the Post. During one of the events, Simmons Tweeted that fashion stylist Rachel Zoe, who also attended the party, called it ‘out of control.’ Leder filed for divorced in 2009 after his wife of 22 years had admitted to cheating on him with her 23-year-old tennis coach. With his marriage over, a friend told the Post the magnate 'went wild,' going on a dating binge. Magnate: Leder, right, co-founded Sun Capital Partners in Boca Raton, left, in 1995 after drawing inspiration from a visit to Romney's firm, Bain Capital . In an interview with the New York Times this past January, Leder criticized the media of mischaracterizing him as a ‘private equity party boy.’ ‘I think the portrayal of me as having wild and crazy parties is absolutely incorrect,’ he told the paper. ‘I spend a small percentage throwing some parties, attending some parties. ‘I like music. I like to dance. But rather than reporting on how I spend 340 days and nights of my year, the media likes to report on the other 25.’ In the same January interview with the Times, the Sun Capital co-CEO revealed that he was inspired to go into private equity after paying a visit to Romney’s investment firm, Bain Capital. ‘Mr. Romney was an early investor in some of the deals done by Mr. Leder's investment company, Sun Capital, which today oversees about $8billion in equity,’ the article said. Leaked: Mother Jones, a liberal news magazine, says it obtained the footage from an anonymous person who attended the fundraiser . Blunder: The resulting outcry is still regarded as one of the main reasons why the Republican lost the race to the White House . The Times noted that Leder’s firm was accused by a federal regulatory agency of pushing the fast food chain Friendly’s into bankruptcy in 2011 to avoid paying pensions – a fate that was shared by some 25 companies in Sun Capital’s portfolio since 2008. Before founding Sun Capital in 1995, Leder worked as a senior vice president at the now-defunct Lehman Brothers. On May 17, Leder organized a fundraiser for Mitt Romney, inviting 150 wealthy donors to his home in Boca Raton for a lavish dinner. During the party, the Republican nominee was taped telling the guests, among other things, that the nearly 50 per cent of voters who support the president ‘believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. Exclusive event: Leder invited some 150 wealthy donors to his Boca Raton home in May to help raise funds for Romney's presidential bid . 'That, that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what…These are people who pay no income tax.' He added that 'my job is not to worry about those people -- I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.' The comments set off a firestorm in the media, prompting Romney to hold a late-night press conference in an attempt to minimize the damage from the leak. The Republican candidate said that Obama believes in 'a government-centred society' whereas he believes in a 'free people, free enterprise, free market' society and had an approach that would put 23 million people back to work. He added that 'my campaign is about helping people take more responsibility' and 'getting people back to work.' Romney conceded only that his sentiments were 'not elegantly stated' because he was 'speaking off the cuff.' Battered: The Obama campaign quickly jumped on the statement saying Romney 'disdained' half of the nation . Standing by his words: At a press conference on Monday, Romney said his remarks were 'not elegantly stated,' but did not back away from the message . On its part, the Obama campaign quickly seized upon the controversial comments by the president’s opponent, which came only 50 days before the November 6 election. In a statement reacting to the secret recordings, Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, said: 'It's shocking that a candidate for President of the United States would go behind closed doors and declare to a group of wealthy donors that half the American people view themselves as ""victims"" entitled to handouts, and are unwilling to take ""personal responsibility"" for their lives. 'It’s hard to serve as president for all Americans when you’ve disdainfully written off half the nation.' Romney's 47 per cent figure seems to have come from a Tax Policy Center report that found 46.4 per cent of American households paid zero income taxes or received a net refund from the government.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Florida woman is lucky to be alive after she was bit by what authorities suspect was a shark while boating with friends Sunday afternoon. Jessica Vaughn was inner-tubing with friends in Fort Lauderdale's Intracoastal Waterway about 2 p.m. when she felt something grab her leg. Vaughn told authorities that she then felt a large fin hit her in the head before she'd realized what had happened. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES & VIDEO . Tough: 23-year-old Jessica Vaughn was bit by a shark on Sunday but 'took it like a champ,' according to friends . Jaws: Witnesses say they saw a bull shark in the water near where Vaughn was bit . Friends say they saw a splash and then heard Vaughn briefly scream, which is when someone told her to get back on the boat. The friend later told police they saw a four-foot bull shark in the water near where Vaughn had been bit. 'We were tubing, and I was just in the water for about 25 minutes,' Vaughn's boyfriend, Peter Hogge, tells WSVN. 'We stopped, she had a life vest on, she went in, another friend went in with her, she got to her tube and ""boom.'"" Kyle Branston, who was in the water with Vaughn when she was bit, tells the station, 'she started saying something bit her or cut her - something. So as I'm getting closer, I see the cut mark on her leg and I was, like, I didn't know what it was at first. I thought she got caught by a glass bottle.' It wasn't until Vaughn was on the boat that they realized the extent of what had happened. After it became apparent that Vaughn had been bit by a shark, the driver of the boat sped to a nearby home at 511 Bayshore Drive and began yelling for help. Someone at the residence called 9-1-1 and an ambulance was dispatched to treat Vaughn. Vaughn was taken to Broward General Hospital, where she underwent surgery to repair the damage to her leg. She is expected to recover. Teeth: Two rows of teethmarks are clearly seen in this image of the back of Vaughn's right leg . The Intracoastal is a series of canals and waterways with outlets to the . Atlantic Ocean. Sharks have been spotted in the Intracoastal in the . past, but sightings are not common in the inland waterway, which is popular for yachting and water sports. Friends told WPLG that just prior to the attack, Vaughn was joking about how she was afraid something in the water would attack her. Sure enough, '30 seconds later,' Vaughn was bit by the shark.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It's not unusual for a British couple to escape the rat race by moving to France - but how about going back 75 years in time as well? Barry and Caroline Selwood have sunk every penny they have into creating their own shrine to the decades either side of the Second World War. But it doesn't end there, because the self-confessed eccentrics live as if it's the summer of 1939, complete with period clothes, furniture and a car all from the era. Vintage style: Caroline and Barry drive a cream Sunbeam Talbot Ten in celebration of a bygone era . Unique time capsule: The couple have re-built a dilapidated riverside hotel in south west France . As it was: La Belle Epoque hotel in south west France as it first looked . Blast from the past: Barry and Caroline, pictured in France, both enjoy dressing in vintage clothes . Perfect spot: The hotel had been abandoned back in the 1950's in the beautiful village of Nanteuil-en-Vallee . 'I guess they think we're just that crazy English couple who run the hotel.' It all started in 2002 when stationery salesman Barry decided his life was going nowhere. He sold his home in Stevenage, Hertforshire, and headed for France where he'd worked on yachts on the Cote d'Azur as a young man. He bought a tumble down farmhouse and set to work, but just a few months later on a trip back to England he met and fell for Caroline from Wokingham, Berkshire. Barry said: 'I'd decided to give up on the rat race, I had a comfortable life as a salesman, but I wanted something different. 'I was working on my farmhouse which I loved, but I loved Caroline too. Luckily she made it easy for me and wanted to be with me in France.' The couple found they both shared a passion for all things vintage. And, after a six-month-long distance relationship, Caroline gave up working as a nanny in London and moved to France. They married five years ago. Stepping back in time: The pair visited vintage events to find authentic items to decorate the hotel . 'We never really thought about how we'd manage,' Caroline said. 'We were young, carefree and in love and had a new and exciting life ahead of us.'The couple took seven to complete the renovation on the farmhouse. They knew their future lay in France and they loved their life in their home complete with swimming pool, but something was missing. 'We needed to find a property we could make into a business so we could support ourselves and live a sustainable life,' said Caroline. Then four years ago they saw a dilapidated hotel which had been abandoned back in the 1950's in the beautiful village of Nanteuil-en-Vallee in the Charente. Caroline said: 'It was love at first sight. It had been stood empty for four years and was derelict and forlorn. 'There were holes in the roof, water had been getting in for years and had taken a heavy toll. Pretty unique: 'There isn't anything like it in the UK where vintage living is more popular', says Caroline . 'We quickly realised we'd spent a large amount of our savings on a pile of rotten timber, collapsed ceilings and mouldy walls! 'And it soon became apparent the renovation budget we'd scribbled down over a couple of bottles of wine was total fantasy.' Work started and for the first couple of years the couple felt like they were 'chipping away at a mountain with a toffee hammer'. Things ground to a halt when Barry was installing a new staircase and he fell, shattering his arm, breaking his nose and a rib. Despite the setback things eventually took shape and the pair knew what the hotel's theme would be. They'd visited vintage events in the UK whenever they could and had been hoarding items. 'But France was a fantastic hunting ground for furniture and paraphernalia, as were local brocantes,' said Barry. 'We trawled eBay for bits and pieces, some of which were perfect and some we got after auctions that ended at midnight. It became madness!' Adding to the experience: The couple have just opened a tea room - and thankfully the bookings are coming in . Blowing the budget: 'We really didn't want to compromise. We wanted the house to appear how it would to people staying here 80 years or so ago', says Caroline . Caroline added: 'We really didn't want to compromise. We wanted the house to appear how it would to people staying here 80 years or so ago. 'We found it really satisfying to put a piece of furniture bought a couple of years before in the place we'd imagined it would go once we had finished the renovation. 'Now it's pretty unique thing in France and there isn't anything like it in the UK where vintage living is more popular.' To help the business they've just opened a tea room too, to add to the whole experience. And thankfully the bookings are coming in. 'If we could go back in time, would we do the same again? Absolutely yes!' said Caroline. 'If we knew how much it would cost, then ""No!"" we'd never have started. 'But our advice to anyone in similar circumstances is ""Go for it!"" And if you happen to be installing a new staircase make sure it's properly secured before you venture up it!'","Barry and Caroline Selwood worked on the intensive project for four years .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A pair of trousers found in a Chinese graveyard might just be the oldest ever found. The clothing is thought to date back a staggering 3,000 years, and despite the fact the ancient apparel has undergone considerable wear and tear, it still looks remarkably intact. The find was made along with a host of other clothing items in the Yanghai tombs in China's vast Tarim Basin. What are thought to be the world's oldest trousers (pictured) have been discovered in one of the Yanghai tombs in China's Tarim Basin. The trousers are made of three bits of cloth, one for each leg and one for the crotch, stitched together. A woven decoration is also visible on the trousers, thought to have been used for horse riding . The trousers, which could actually date up to 3,300 years old, are thought to be the oldest ever discovered. A new paper by Ulrike Beck and colleagues of the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin suggests the invention of trousers is linked to horseback riding. Finds, such as the one reported at the Yahghai cemetery, highlight fragments of woollen trousers dating back to the 13th and 10th centuries BC. The age of the trousers corresponds to the known age of horse riding, which is thought to have begun up to 4,000 years ago. ‘Together with horse gear and weapons as grave goods in both tombs our results specify former assumptions that the invention of bifurcated [split into two parts] lower body garments is related to the new epoch of horseback riding, mounted warfare and greater mobility,’ wrote the researchers. ‘Trousers are essential parts of the tool kit with which humans improve their physical qualities.’ They signify a period when people needed new clothing for horse riding. Older clothing such as robes and togas were not suitable for riding, leading to the rise in popularity of trousers. The finding was reported in a paper for the Quaternary International. ‘This new paper definitely supports the idea that trousers were invented for horse riding by mobile pastoralists, and that trousers were brought to the Tarim Basin by horse-riding peoples,’ linguist Victor Mair from the University of Pennsylvania told ScienceNews. Horse riding is thought to have begun up to 4,000 years ago, suggesting that trousers, too, could have originated that far back. The discovery at Yanghai were of two men thought to be 40 years-old, wearing the trousers. The clothing suggests they were herders - but they were likely warriors, too. Among the items recovered with the men were a whip, a wooden horse bit, a battle-axe and a bow. The find was made along with a host of other clothing items in the Yanghai tombs in China's vast Tarim Basin . Other items have also been found as part of the project known as Silk Road Fashion. These include various garments dating back 3,000 years discovered in eastern central Asia. A fur coat (pictured being analysed by German and Chinese scientists), is among the finds and each of the relics is said to be of great value . The age of the trousers was estimated using radiocarbon dating and their design, perhaps understandably, was fairly primitive compared to modern standards. In total. the two pairs were each made of three pieces of cloth - one for each leg and one for the crotch. A ‘belt’ of sorts had been fashioned from strings, while the garments themselves were decorated with a woven design. The Yanghai tombs are a vast ancient cemetery spanning approximately 580,000 square feet (54,000 square metres). The hot and dry climate in the area known as the Tarim Basin has helped to preserve corpses, clothing and other artefacts for thousands of years. Since digs at the site began in the 1970s, over 500 tombs have been excavated with numerous finds made.","Ancient clothing artefacts have been found in China's Yanghai tombs .

"By . Lydia Warren . A mother-of-five lied about having cancer - even to her children - and collected tens of thousands of dollars of donations in a startling scam that lasted for two years, police have said. Alissa Jackson, a married 31-year-old nurse from Belleville, Illinois, told friends and family she had stage IV ovarian cancer that was spreading to her organs and brain. They rallied around her - setting up a Facebook page entitled 'Alissa's Army' and helping to sell t-shirts, throw parties, make food for her family and collect donations from local businesses. Many people were touched by the story on her Facebook page, which explained she had five young children and that she had previously been a drug addict before turning her life around. 'Lies': Alissa Jackson, 31, (pictured left in a police photo and right during her alleged scam) allegedly lied about having terminal cancer for two years and raised $35,000. She has been charged with felony theft . One friend speculated that they had helped her raise around $35,000, the Belleville News-Democrat reported. But about two months ago, some of her friends became suspicious of her claims when they noticed inconsistencies in her story - including seeing her chase a dog - and contacted police. Officers carried out the investigation over a month and learned that she had allegedly never been diagnosed with cancer. Dana McQuade, who sent Jackson cleaning supplies, told the News-Democrat Alissa that the friends had started questioning her claims when they saw her at some local batting cages. 'She's chasing . after her dog,' McQuade said. 'Jenn said, ""Wait a minute, this isn't . right. She's doing something that someone with stage four ovarian cancer . wouldn't be doing"".' McQuade said Jackson called her on Sunday and confessed to the lies. 'Scam': Jackson also lied to her five children (pictured), who believed their mother was going to die . Support: Jackson, pictured with her husband, had support from across the world from relatives and strangers . 'It . would have been the easiest thing in the world for her to produce a . medical record with a doctor's diagnosis that she has stage four ovarian . cancer - but she couldn't,' McQuade said. Friend Dana McQuade . 'She was bawling on the phone. She was saying, ""I didn't mean to hurt anybody. I don't want to go to . jail. My husband is going to leave me."" 'And I told her, ""You need to do . the right thing and turn yourself in"".' It is not known how much her husband Brandon knew about her lies. Among the donations, she allegedly took more than $500 from local Pizza Hut restaurants that donated 20 per cent of their profits one day last month. A local bar, JR's Last Call, also gave her $1,400 in cash, while one woman gave more than $500 buying and selling t-shirts for the 'cause' earlier this year, a criminal complaint alleges. 'The deepest form of being a lowlife in . my eyes to fake a disease like cancer that so many people fight and lose - . it's just, it's unconceivable that someone could do it,' JR's bar manager . Pam Bruce told KDSK. Revelation: Her alleged scam emerged after two friends grew suspicious of her story after seeing her chase a dog and they contacted police - who learned she had allegedly never had cancer . Fake: Friends formed a fundraising group called 'Alissa's Army' to sell t-shirts and organize collections . One of the friends who contacted police, Jenn Huelsmann, said that reactions to the revelations had been varied but that they had simply wanted to do the right thing. 'This situation has been very sad and . heartbreaking,' Huelsmann said. 'We ask that everyone please, for the . sake of the people involved, consider the feelings of Alissa's children . and understand that people closest to her made the best choices we could . based on the information that we had.' The News-Democrat reported that a reporter spoke to Jackson's mother-in-law, who insisted that Jackson did have cancer. She was charged on Wednesday with two counts of felony theft and her bond was set at $100,000. Belleville police said that the scam had reached people across the world. 'To the hundreds of people who donated to ""Alissa’s Army"": Do not let Jackson’s evil prevent you from helping . people in the future,' Belleville police said in a statement on Wednesday.","Alissa Jackson, 31, told friends and family that she had stage IV ovarian cancer that was spreading to her organs and brain .

"By . Dan Bloom . Most groggy-eyed workers need a kick in the mornings. But a businessman is offering a buzz which will make most bosses frown - a nice bottle of cannabis-infused iced coffee. At up to $11 each, the drinks could be on sale as soon as next month and are the brainchild of an entrepreneur in Washington state, one of only two in the U.S. where selling the drug is legal. Coffee pot: Cannabis-infused iced coffee could soon be on sale in Washington state and Colorado . The drinks will contain 20 milligrams of THC, the active ingredient in cannabis, roughly the same amount as in half a joint. And their website makes no secret of their promised effects, claiming the Cold Brew, coffee infused with cannabis, is the 'the John Wayne of cold brews - strong and bold with a true cowboy’s swagger.' Cannabis is decriminalised in almost 20 states - but only for possession or medical use, and in some it can still be a small-scale violation. The drink will only be sold in markets where selling cannabis is fully legal, including for recreational use. These are: . WASHINGTON STATE . Small amounts were legalised for over-21s in 2012, but regulatory delays meant the first licences were only granted in March this year. COLORADO . Legalised last year and the first stores opened in January. Over-21s can grow up to six plants or possess up to an ounce with no penalty. It adds: 'Knock one back with your . compadres and take on the day with a smooth buzz and a grin a mile . wide... A powerful body buzz and a smooth, freeing head high.' Another . drink's advert claims: 'Drinking this coffee is like riding a cool avalanche of pure . deliciousness down a tall mountain and landing in an ocean of good . feelings. 'You’ll swim off into a day of work or play filled to the brim with pure joy.' The . soft drinks are set to come in five flavours, including cherry, lemon . ginger and pomegranate, and will only be on sale where cannabis is . legal. Called Mirth Provisions, the firm was dreamed up by e-commerce firm manager Adam Stites, 34, in the city of Longview, Washington. He told MailOnline he has been working on the drink for about six months. 'I wanted to be part of the history of my home state,' he said 'It's revolutionary and a great opportunity to establish some intellectual property in this state. 'It wasn't simple. We're still using two strains of it, then there's the dynamic of how it plays with the caffeine.' Mr Stites added: 'We . don't want to pack so much THC into every one of our drinks that it's . unpleasant, especially for people that are just getting into marijuana. 'I'm 6ft 4in and 205 pounds, and 20mg is sufficient for me, especially when it's brewed with coffee'. Chill out! In case any customers were in doubt, each bottle reminds them of its legality in huge lettering . He . claimed he will be able to produce 'several hundred bottles per hour' after the manufacturing method gains approval from state regulators. The drink passed its final tests with the Washington State Liquor Control Board on May 16. There is just one stumbling block - its drinkers may not be allowed to drive. Cannabis . is decriminalised in almost 20 states, but in the vast majority of . those it is still a civil offence or only allowed for medical use. Tax hit: Colorado has collected more than $12m . Only two states allow the drug and related products to be sold. Washington state legalised cannabis for recreational use in 2012, and after several delays the first licences were granted to stores this year. The drug is also legal in Colorado, where over-21s can grow up to six plants for personal use or possess up to an ounce without facing any penalty. Since the laws were passed a huge industry has sprung up offering seeds and a bewildering array of products. Cannabis-lovers can now buy THC-infused elixirs, massage oils, bath soaks and hundreds of varieties of plants with names like Ghost Train Haze and Somali Taxi Ride. Authorities, meanwhile, have collected millions of dollars in tax. In the first three months after shops opened on January 1 in Colorado, the state reaped $7.3million - not including licensing fees or medical marijuana, which bring the total to more than $12million. Mr Stites told MailOnline it had been a very creative process - especially after a few 'coffees'. 'It certainly taps into a different part of your mind,' he said. 'It can release perspectives that you didn't know existed.'","The drinks promise a 'powerful body buzz and a smooth, freeing head high'

"By . Wills Robinson . Mary, Lady Soames, 91, died peacefully at her west London home yesterday evening surrounded by her family, after a short illness . Winston Churchill's last surviving daughter, Mary, Lady Soames, has died at the age of 91. She passed away peacefully at her west London home yesterday evening surrounded by her family, after a short illness. She was the youngest of the five children of the wartime prime minister and his wife Clementine. One of her sons, the Conservative MP Nicholas Soames, said: 'She was a truly remarkable and extraordinary woman, who led a very distinguished life.' Mary Churchill worked for the Red Cross and the Women's Voluntary Service from 1939 to 1941, and joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service with whom she served in London, Belgium and Germany in mixed anti-aircraft batteries, rising to the rank of Junior Commander (equivalent to Captain). She also accompanied her father as aide-de-camp on several of his overseas journeys, including his post-VE trip to Potsdam, where he met with US president Harry S Truman and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. She married the Conservative politician Christopher Soames (later Baron Soames) in 1947 and they had five children - Nicholas, Emma, Jeremy, Charlotte and Rupert. Lady Soames served many public organisations, such as the International Churchill Society, as a Patron; Church Army and Churchill Houses; and chaired the Royal National Theatre. She was Patron of the National Benevolent Fund for the Aged. She is pictured with her father at her wedding at St. Margaret's Church, London in 1947 . She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her public service, particularly in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and was appointed a Lady Companion of the Order of the Garter in 2005. She wrote an acclaimed biography of her mother, Clementine Churchill, in 1979, which won a Wolfson Prize, and her own memoirs. Mr Soames said: 'She was not just a wonderful mother to whom we were all devoted, but the head and heart of our family after our father died, and will be greatly missed. 'She was a distinguished writer and led a distinguished life, with her service in the War, and is part of that generation which is passing. 'This is extraordinary timing - just before the anniversary of the Normandy landings, Churchill's last surviving child dies. It is the great swing of history.'

"By . Hugo Gye . Poignant photographs of the aftermath of the atomic bomb attack on Nagasaki have been unearthed after lying hidden for seven decades. The images were taken by one of Japan's top photographers the day after the explosion, but were then confiscated by the U.S. military in a bid to stop them being used as propaganda. They show the devastated landscape of the formerly thriving city, with lines of refugees looking for shelter and the skeletons of hollowed-out buildings after the bombing, which killed 75,000 residents of Nagasaki. Horror: This never-before-seen picture shows the city of Nagasaki after it was hit be an atomic bomb in August 1945 . Haunting: The photographs show the skeletons of obliterated buildings following the unprecedented blast . Survivors: A woman and child pictured in the aftermath of the attack sporting a dazed look . The pictures were taken by Yosuke Yamahata, the only Japanese photographer to document the aftermath of the atomic bomb attack. He was sent to the city on the morning of the raid on August 9, 1945, to capture photographs to be used for Japanese propaganda. Many of his images became well-known symbols of the historic bombing - but others, taken on a faulty camera, have not been seen since. They were found in a photo album which was confiscated by an American military policeman at the end of the Second World War, but whose significance was only recently discovered by a private owner. Wasteland: A shrine sitting amidst the devastation in another photograph taken by propagandist Yosuke Yamahata . Tenderness: A mother breastfeeds her baby, covered in debris after the Allied attack . Confiscated: This unidentified military policeman took the photo album to stop it being used as Japanese propaganda . An atomic bomb weighing more than 4,000kg was dropped on Nagasaki by parachute from an American B29 Bomber at 11.02 local time on August 9, 1945. Nicknamed 'the Fat Man', it exploded 500m above ground and completely destroyed the city, on the Japanese island of Kyushu. It was the second attack by the United States on a Japanese city in three days. More than 3million leaflets had been dropped over the country from American aeroplanes warning  that atomic weapons would be used 'again and again' unless the war was ended. The Japanese surrendered less than a week later on August 15. Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects killed 90,000-166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000-80,000 in Nagasaki. It is expected to fetch £20,000 when it goes up for auction at Bonhams in New York this week. Tom Lamb, a historian from the auction house, said: 'These photographs come from an album that was put together by an American military policeman who had been sent to police Osaka after the end of World War II. 'The policeman assembled around 250 photographs in the album during his time in Japan and most of them detail his life as a military policeman and around the city. 'But among the photos are 24 that were taken by Yosuke Yamahata, a Japanese photographer whose images of the destruction to Nagasaki became known worldwide. 'The album contains some of Yamahata's most famous images but there are others in the set that have never been seen before. 'It is thought these photos come from a second, faulty camera that Yamahata had with him. 'These photographs started off life as propaganda against the Americans, who wanted very much to cover up what they had just done. 'Censorship was high and so the photos of the destruction were kept under shop counters and handed out surreptitiously. 'At some point it seems the military policeman confiscated the photos from a Japanese citizen in Osaka and put them in his album with no knowledge of their importance. The dropping of the two atomic bombs was the most devastating action the world has ever seen. 'These photos serve as a reminder of the power we hold that keeps the peace. Today's nuclear bombs are 100 times that ferocity of those that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.'","The photographs were taken by Yosuke Yamahata and used as propaganda by the Japanese .

"By . James Gordon . Miranda Lambert had a scare last night when her private jet was forced to make an emergency landing at an airport in West Virginia. The country star was in the middle of a hectic week and was flying from New York to Nashville when the plane lost pressure and was forced to divert to the town of Clarksburg. Ms. Lambert took to Instagram to tell her her fans what had happened. Platinum! Miranda Lambert and her team playing around with some of the firefighters hazmat suits after her plane made an emergency landing at an airport in West Virginia. The cause remains unknown . 'Our plane had an emergency landing in Clarksburg WV. But don't worry, we found platinum fire suits,' she wrote. Platinum being the name of her latest album which came out yesterday. Killing time while the problem with the plane was sorted, Lambert and her crew hung out with airport firefighters while trying on their shiny hazmat suits. The Westwind twin jet departed Teterboro, NJ, just outside New York City on Tuesday afternoon with a plan to land at Nashville International Airport. She spent about three hours on the ground before the group resumed their journey southward towards Music City. Star appeal: The country singer had given an interview at Good Morning America in New York City earlier in the day . 'The plane that they were on lost cabin pressure,' according to Scott Poling, a lineman at the airport who spoke to Metro News. 'We don’t know why. They landed here safely with no problems and hung out for about two hours. A Learjet was  sent up here from Nashville to pick them back up.' 'She’s super down-to-earth, doesn’t act like a celebrity, a country girl,' Mr Poling said. 'They put on our fire suits inside here to promote their new album ‘Platinum,’ which I have pictures of. She autographed a couple of CDs for me and my buddies here. It was pretty cool.' 'She was really happy. She thanked us several times,' said Mr Poling. 'Her staff thanked us several times for what we did for them here and they sat back, had a good time, relaxed and waited until the jet arrived and said it was  beautiful here in West Virginia.' Pioneer: Miranda Lambert is on the cover of this months' Rolling Stone Magazine - its first country issue .

"By . Sarah Michael . Mathew McGrath, 18, was arrested after a hoax emergency prompted a police swoop on his family home in Arncliffe, Sydney on Wednesday . A Sydney teenager who was arrested after a hoax call to police caused authorities to swoop on his family home has denied making the call and says he is the victim of an elaborate prank. Police descended on the home in the southern suburb of Arncliffe around 4.40am on Wednesday after reports shots had been fired and some of its occupants had been tied up. Mathew McGrath, 18, surrendered and was taken to Kogarah police station for questioning but he has since been released from custody. It now appears he may have fallen victim to a 'swatting' prank, whereby callers phone in fake crimes to elicit an urgent police response to another person's house. Swatting is a modern equivalent of a bomb hoax by telephone and is carried out using online technology that masks the perpetrator's identity. A search turned up no evidence of any shooting and NSW Police are forensically examining three laptop computers and a smart phone found at the Bonar Street house. 'At this stage of inquiries, the matter is being investigated as a public mischief incident,' police said in a statement. The teen has been released pending further inquiries. Scroll down for video . Mr McGrath's sister Kristy denied her brother made any calls to police, saying he was asleep at the time . His sister Kristy McGrath said her brother did not contact the police to report a shooting and he was asleep in bed when it happened. 'The messages were sent via a computer, not actual phone calls,' Ms McGrath told MailOnline. 'I am positive that my brother Mathew would not do such a ridiculous thing and whoever has done this should be ashamed of themselves. 'Mathew is a kind hearted, well-natured man and does not deserve any of this. 'I can only hope that the people responsible are caught and held accountable for their actions.' Neighbour Ray Anderson described the teen as 'a very nice lad'. Mr Anderson told AAP he was woken early on Wednesday morning by bright lights, before seeing police and TV crews lining his usually quiet street. 'I woke up to a great big light shining in my window,' he said. 'It was still dark.' Police descended on the home (pictured) in the southern Sydney suburb of Arncliffe around 4.40am on Wednesday . A NSW State Crime Command spokesman said 'swatting' was a colloquial US term to describe the prank calling of emergency services whereby 'SWAT' style teams are despatched to bogus incidents at homes of innocent people. In 2013 a number of overseas celebrities were the subject of this style of prank, but he said it was not currently an issue in NSW. 'Anyone that is found to have made bogus contact with emergency services, and subsequently wasted public resources, will be dealt with by the full extent of the law,' he said. In NSW, public mischief carries a maximum penalty of 12 months in prison and a fine of $5500.

"By . Sally Lee . Their destination was Australia - a place they could call home. These historic moments of resettlement were captured as new arrivals landed on Aussie shores after World War II. The photographs have been released by The National Archives in Canberra as they launched a new exhibition to give insight into life in Australia's migrant hostels. The National Archives in Canberra has launched a new photographic exhibition which gives insight into life in Australia's migrant hostels. Pictured is a migrant family entering their new home in Maribyrnong, Victoria in 1965 . While 20,000 photos were handed over by the Department of Immigration, curator Amy Lay told the ABC that 50 images have been chosen to feature at the exhibition - A Place to Call Home? Migrant Hostel Memories - which will be on display until September 14. 'We found the hostels were the most evocative sets of photographs so lots of people had experiences they could relate to... they brought back lots of memories,' she said. Migrant hostels were established around Australia after World War II to accommodate the vast number of newcomers. The hostels were described as basic with shared washing and eating facilities by National Archives of Australia. They were occupied by thousands of resettlers. For some, their stay was brief while others lived there for months or even years. 'There was a large shortage of accommodation, so the idea would be they would provide a stepping stone for migrants into life in Australia, so they could get help finding a job, they could get English lessons if they needed them,' Ms Lay said. The exhibition, A Place to Call Home? Migrant Hostel Memories, features 50 archived images released by the Department of Immigration. Pictured is an Asian woman using the cooking facilities in Tamarind, Northern Territory in 1984 . British arrivals were driven by bus to a Sydney hostel, accompanied by a member of the Good Neighbour Council in 1962.

Turkish migrants at prayer at Broadmeadows, Victoria in 1969. In 1920, Turkish migrants were forbidden from entering Australia under the Enemy Aliens Act. However, in 1967 Turkey became the first country beyond Western Europe to sign an Assisted Passage agreement with Australia, prompting an increase in immigration from Turkey . The archive's exhibition shows a mixture of official government photos and personal recounts of migrants who lived in the hostels. The vivid photographs portray how friendships were formed, challenges that were encountered and the start of a new life in Australia. However Ms Lay believes the personal insights bring the exhibition to life. 'The Department of Immigration wanted to show a certain side of these hostels, they wanted to show the positive side,' she said. 'But those personal images actually draw back the real experiences in the hostels... the places might not have been as luxurious as they thought.' While the images may rekindle memories for some, it will also give the rest of the country rare and unique vision into the difficulties faced by early migrants, Ms Lay said.

Practice doesn’t make perfect – but meditation might. Researchers say that however hard some people try, they will not excel at their  chosen skill. That is because the key to  perfection is in the mind, say the scientists, who claim that people who rise to the top have more ‘highly integrated’ brains. A team led by Dr Fred Travis, a neuroscientist and advocate of Transcendental Meditation at the Maharishi University of Management in Iowa, sought to discover the secret of success. He said the key is a high level of ‘brain integration’, which means connections between various regions of the brain are strong. 'It’s a simple fact that some people stand out, and we’re trying to tease out why,' said lead researcher Dr Fred Travis, from the Maharishi University of Management in the U.S. 'While there’s a common notion that 10,000 hours of practice is necessary for high achievement, some people put in long hours and do not excel. 'This work.. suggests that brain integration may be the inner factor that leads to outer success.' Dr Travis studied 21 Swedish product development engineers, a group expected to display high levels of creativity. His team found a strong correlation between higher flexibility and originality in creativity tests, and higher levels of brain integration, faster decision making, and a sense of being in control. Peace: An author of the study said the brain working in harmony is pivotal to creativity . Co-author Dr Yvonne Lagrosen, from University West in Sweden, said: 'Our empirical findings highlight that creativity, in the form of flexibility and originality, is connected to whole brain functioning and psychological development. 'Since creativity is highly important for individual success, optimising brain functioning should be a priority for every student.' Previous research has shown greater brain integration in world-class athletes, top managers and professional musicians, said Dr Travis, whose findings appear in the Creativity Research Journal.","Researchers found 'brain integration' is the secret to success .

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . Six people are dead after two horrific chain-reaction crashes occurred just hours apart on Interstate 95 near Jacksonville, Florida. The crashes happened late on Saturday in Flagler and St. Johns counties and closed southbound lanes of the major interstate through until Sunday morning. Two people – a teen and a 56-year-old woman - were killed in a three-vehicle crash south of Palm Coast Parkway in Flagler County at 5.30pm on Saturday afternoon. Two people ¿ a teen and a 56-year-old woman - were killed in a three-vehicle crash south of Palm Coast Parkway in Flagler County at 5.30pm on Saturday afternoon . Several hours later, four more people were killed in an 11-vehcile crash, including three tractor trailer trucks, in St. Johns County. The victims in the first crash have been named as Michael Smith, 17, of Jacksonville and Pamela Thor, 56, of St. Augustine. Officials have not yet released the names of those killed in the second incident, reports The Florida-Times Union. The first crash involved two pickup trucks and a car. Smith was a passenger in a Chevrolet 1500 pickup truck driven by Roy Roger White, 38, of Jacksonville who sustained minor injuries and was taken to Florida Hospital Flagler in Palm Coast. Thor, who was driving a Honda Civic, died at the scene. The other pickup truck, a Chevrolet Silverado, was driven by Michael Jeffrey Mervis, 53, who had a passenger, Kimberly Patricia Martinson, 47. Four more people were killed in an 11-vehcile crash, including three tractor trailer trucks, in St. Johns County later on Saturday . Pamela Thor, 56, of St. Augustine, died in a three-vehicle crash south of Palm Coast Parkway in Flagler County at 5.30pm on Saturday afternoon . Mervis wasn’t injured. Martinson sustained minor injuries but wasn’t taken to a hospital, the highway patrol said. White, Thor, Mervis and Martinson all had been wearing their seat belts, but Smith wasn’t, the preliminary investigation showed. Troopers said alcohol did not play a role in the crash. Charges are pending as the investigation continues. The chain-reaction crash in St. Johns County happened about 7:30 p.m. and was partly a consequence of the earlier Flagler County crash accident as traffic was backed up. The southbound traffic was being detoured to the U.S. 1 Exit. While vehicles were stopped waiting to get onto the detour, a commercial truck didn't stop for some reason and struck the rear of the stopped vehicles. That triggered a series of chain-reaction collisions which sparked a fire that engulfed several of the vehicles. The crash involved at least eight passenger vehicles and three trucks. The Florida Department of Transportation was set to inspect the roadway and initiate any necessary emergency repairs. At 1 p.m. on Sunday, two of three southbound lanes of I-95 at State Road 206 were open but the Florida Highway Patrol continued to encourage people to avoid the area.","Two chain-reactions occurred just hours apart in Florida on Saturday .

"By . Freya Noble . A Carlton Blues player has been kicked off the team for inappropriate conduct on social media. It was ruled that Josh Bootsma breached the AFL's code of conduct, by reportedly posting explicit images on photo-sharing app Snap Chat. The club was notified of the misconduct on Monday, apparently by the mother of a teenage girl who was believed to be exchanging images with the player. Bootsma's girlfriend Kyla Maree Addis is heavily pregnant, with the couple's baby due any day now, according to The Age. Scroll down for video . Carlton Blues player Josh Bootsma has been sacked from the club for sending explicit photos on SnapChat . It was announced on Tuesday that the Carlton player would not continue his contract with the club. This is not the first time Bootsma has been in breach of the code, and when Carlton football manager Andrew McKay addressed the media on Tuesday he said Bootsma had been known to arrive late to training and skip appointments. 'That was the final straw that broke the camels back for us to decide to terminate his contract,' Mr McKay said. While Josh Bootsma is in hot water after reportedly sending inappropriate images to a teenager, his girlfriend Kyla is due to give birth any day . When asked about the nature of the inappropriate content, Mr McKay said he didn't believe it was necessary to go into the details. 'The point is he's put something on social media that's highly inappropriate, and it really does not meet the standards of the football club.' The football manager also said that the club had tried to help Bootsma by offering him support and welfare but he had continued to let the side down. SnapChat allows users to send photos to each other which can only be viewed for a short amount of time . 'The Carlton Football Club has high expectations of its players and staff; we expect them to uphold certain standards,' he said. In a statement Carlton said the defender had been offered counseling and welfare but had not met the club's behaviour standards, according to the Herald Sun. Bootsma had a contract with the club until the end of 2015, and is currently coming to an agreement with Carlton in regards to it, with The Age reporting that he will not be paid out. He hasn't taken to the field for the club this year, and his last game was played in round 21 of 2013.","Carlton Player Josh Bootsma kicked out of the team .

"By . Darren Boyle . Protesters and police clashed in Sao Paulo Thursday, as demonstrations against the World Cup and rallies calling for improved public services erupted in several Brazilian cities. Officers in Brazil's largest city fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who set piles of rubbish alight to barricade a central avenue. Demonstrators blasted the billions spent to host next month's football tournament and said they wanted to draw attention to what they called a lack of investment to improve poor public services. One protestor taking part in the 'International Day of World Cup Resistance' burned a Brazilian flag in Sao Paulo . Some of the protesters set fire to rubbish strewn on the streets of Sao Paulo as part of the anti-World cup demonstration . Luana Gurhter, social sciences student said: 'We are beginning to gain strength to go against the injustices of the World Cup. We are the ones who should decide where the public money goes. More funding for schools, hospitals, housing, transportation - not the Cup.' Gurther and a thousand other mostly young protesters gathered on a main business avenue in the city of 11 million, loudly beating drums and cans and raising banners with messages such as 'less money for the Cup and more for housing'. Protesters staged a soccer game with dirty tactics, and one man put on a costume of a giant skeleton dressed as a Brazil player. Protesters demanded that money being spent on the World Cup should have been targeted at public services . Heavily armed Brazilian police have launched a major operation to protect the host stadiums . Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets in Sao Paulo last night in one of the largest anti-World Cup demonstrations in advance of next month's tournament . The demonstration turned violent when some people smashed the windows of a Hyundai car dealership and the offices of a bank. Police arrested seven people carrying Molotov cocktails. While widespread, the rallies were far smaller than the protests that engulfed the nation last year and had largely ended by Thursday night. Thursday's demonstrations blocked two key roads into Sao Paulo during the morning commute. Protestors in Recife took advantage of a three-day strike by paramilitary police to loot supermarkets. Brazil has mobilised hundreds of police and military officers in a bid to keep the peace in advance of next month's World Cup .

Some protestors took advantage of a strike by paramilitary police in Recife to loot a supermarket . Outside the new stadium that will host the opening match of the Cup, about 1,500 activists fighting for more housing waved Brazilian flags as black smoke rose from the flames burning tires. Guilherme Boulos, head of the Homeless Workers Movement, whose activists gathered at Itaquerao Stadium on the eastern outskirts of Sao Paulo said: 'Our goal is symbolic. We do not want to destroy or damage the stadium. 'What we want are more rights for workers to have access to housing and to show the effects the Cup has brought to the poor.' The Brazilian government had hoped that hosting the World Cup and the next Olympics in Rio in 2016 would have been popular with the electorate . A wide range of protestors are taking part in the major demonstrations that are happening nightly an advance of next month's tournament . Military police also been involved in attempts to quell the violent demonstrations before the world's media arrives in Brazil over the next fortnight . The group claims many people have been forced out of their homes because of rising rents in the neighborhood around the new stadium. Police blocked the main entrance next to a construction zone where cranes and other machines were lined up to carry materials still needed to finish the football arena. As night fell, rallies were held in Rio de Janeiro, causing chaos for traffic in the center of the city. In the capital Brasilia, protesters carried banners reading 'FIFA Go Home,' while in another Cup host city Belo Horizonte, about 2,000 people took to the streets to complain of the football tournament. Police men eventually secure the street after the protest and attempt to deal with the remaining embers of the fire . Among those demonstrating in Sao Paulo are anarchist 'Black bloc' protesters . Security forces in Brazil have been stretched to cope with the level of protests across the country . In northeastern Brazil, looters ransacked stores in the World Cup host city of Recife, where a police strike led to lawlessness. Police there entered the third day of a strike for a 50 percent pay hike. Authorities said they'd already decided to cancel two professional league football matches planned for this weekend in the city. Government press officer Manoel Guimaraes for Recife said: 'They are obviously using the proximity of the World Cup to pressure us to give into their demands.' By late Thursday, it appeared the police strike was ending and officers were expected to return to the streets in the coming hours. Recife will host five World Cup matches, starting on June 14. Heavily armed policeman patrol Sao Paulo on the 'International Day of World Cup Resistance' The Brazilian government has tried to clean up several of the lawless favelas in advance of next month's tournament causing much resentment among the population . Brazil is often considered as a 'football mad' nation although the population has expressed its outrage over the amount of money spent in advance of the tournament . The tournament will kick-off on June 12 under heavy security with hosts Brazil playing Croatia . The demonstrations Thursday were being watched as a test of the government's ability to maintain security during the World Cup. Many Brazilians are angry at the billions spent to host the World Cup. Protesters have said the government should focus spending instead on improving Brazil's woeful health, education, security and infrastructure systems. Brazilian leaders had hoped the World Cup and then the 2016 Olympics in Rio would put a favorable spotlight on the country, showing advances over the past decade in improving its economy and pulling tens of millions out of poverty. Meanwhile, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised any fans intending traveling to Brazil for the World Cup to avoid any mass protests or demonstrations.

"By . Joshua Gardner . A young Georgia teen is undergoing treatment this weekend after he strangled to death a suspected rabid fox that attacked him seemingly out of nowhere on Wednesday. Ryan Prather, 13, was sitting on a street curb in Douglasville when the fox came from behind him and ferociously latched onto his arm. In a quick-thinking show of bravery befitting someone far older, Ryan reacted by putting an end to the sickly creature's rampage before anyone else could be hurt. Out of nowhere: 13-year-old Ryan Prather is undergoing treatment to enure he doesn't develop rabies after a ferocious fox likely infected with the virus latched onto his arm as he sat on a street curb . According to WXIA, Ryan was the second person bitten by a suspiciously aggressive fox in the immediate area in less than two days. Ryan's attack occurred at 7pm Wednesday. In the predawn hours that morning, another victim was bitten nearby, but the fox got away. When a fox attacked him, Ryan says it wasn't heroism but an instinctual response that led him to kill the wild animal. 'I looked up and this thing bit me,' he told WXIA. 'I looked at it and it looked like a possum, but it wasn't a possum, it was a fox.' And a crazed fox at that. Hero: Prather bravely subdued the crazed animal by strangling it to death. Authorities said it was likely the same fox that had bitten another Douglasville, Georgia resident earlier that day . 'It was latched onto my arm and I just grabbed it and choked it and it let go and I just hit it,' he said. Douglas County Animal Control manager Frances McMillan told WXIA the boy likely saved other residents of the Atlanta suburb from future attacks. even if it took little effort to put the fox out of its misery. 'He was defending himself and the fox died fairly easily,' McMillan. 'It was already in a weakened state.' Authorities have now sent the fox to be tested for the deadly virus, but Ryan is being treated in the meantime. 'They said it was better to go ahead and get started with the shots than waiting on the test to come back,' Prather told the Douglas County Sentinel. There are only roughly two human rabies deaths in the United States each year, making the attack the more rare and bizarre. However, McMillan is urging county residents to be vigilant and to get their pets vaccinated.","Ryan Prather, 13, was sitting on a curb in Douglasville, Georgia on Wednesday when a wild fox came out of nowhere and locked onto his arm .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Politics as usual: Tito Jackson Jr, mayor of Bogota, New Jersey, claims he was punched in the face by a rival's 80-year-old father outside a polling station . A small-town New Jersey mayor claims he was punched in the face by a political rival's octogenarian father after voting in Tuesday's election. Tito Jackson Jr, the mayor of Bogota, New Jersey, has filed a complaint with the local police accusing Salvatore Trotta of assaulting him outside the polling station. ‘I cast my vote, he was waiting by my car, he shook my hand and wouldn't let go of my hand,’ Mr Jackson told PolitickerNJ. Jackson, a Democrat, and Mr Trotta got into a shoving match until the elderly man punched the mayor in the face. Trotta, 80, is the father of Tina Trotta, who is running for a city council seat against a crop of candidates supported by Mayor Jackson. Ms Trotta is also a plaintiff in a lawsuit asking the borough of Bogota to replace dozens of trees that had been chopped down to make way for a parking lot. Following the incident, Jackson, who is married and has a daughter in her early 20s, said that his much older opponent did not beat him up, but delivered a single blow to his face. ‘He took my phone out of my hand and punched me,’ Jackson summed up. ‘I'm not hurt. My face is a little swollen.’ However, Salvatore Trotta presented his own version of events differing from the mayor’s. Rivalry: Jackson's attacker is the father of Tina Trotta, who is running for city council against a crop of candidates supported by the mayor . The 80-year-old claimed that he struck Mayor Jackson in self-defense outside the polling place. Mr Trotta explained that he approached Jackson, the two men shook hands, and he asked the mayor if he had cut down trees in a parking lot. In response, the mayor allegedly told Trotta: 'Your daughter is nothing but a money-hungry piece of s***.' Some more words were exchanged, after which Trotta claims Jackson shoved him. ‘He jumped all over me. I went back two feet,’ said Tina Trotta’s father, who worked in the securities industry until his retirement.

"By . Joshua Gardner . A woman who lost her arms as an infant in Kolkata when her 11-year-old mother attempted to end both of their lives by standing in front of an oncoming train in a murder-suicide attempt is now a happily married mother in Las Vegas. The incredible journey of Shanthi Kimball began tragically in poverty but her sad course was reversed just a year later when a Mormon family from Montana adopted her and raised her as their own. Now Kimball is raising two boys with her husband Conrad with the help of her unbelievably skilled feet, which she uses to do everything, from changing diapers to driving. New beginnings: Shanthi Kimball with her husband, Conrad, has managed to overcome a tough start in life after losing both arms when her 11-year-old mother tried to end both their lives . Hope: Shanthi had to have both arms amputated, but an American family later adopted her from an Indian orphanage . 'It actually hasn’t been that hard because it’s normal for me,' Kimball said told Deseret News. Her life has taken her from the streets of some of the world's most depressed slums to a joyful religious life in a gleaming American city. It all began when she was found beside some train tracks at two months old. Her arms had been severed from her body. Nearby were the remains of her 11-year-old mother. Baby Shanthi was taken to an orphanage, where she would wait 11 months before finally being adopted by a Mormon couple, though even for the deeply faithful Montana couple it wasn't an easy decision. Her mother Karen first saw her in a pamphlet that showed pictures of some of India's homeless or abandoned children. 'I quickly told her that she didn't know what she was talking about, I meant the hardship of raising a child with a handicap such as that. Karen quickly said, that doesn't matter and she was meant to be our daughter, but I quickly said no again, Shanthi's adoptive father Bruce wrote in his journal. Tough start: Despite having to learn to overcome her disability, Shanthi thrived as a loved member of her adopted family . However, he soon found himself having a change of heart after reading a passage of scripture in the Bible's book of Matthew. 'When I read that passage it struck me with much force that Shanthi was the child ordained in heaven to be our daughter, and that I was denying her, and I would be held accountable if I denied her any longer,' Bruce wrote. Shanthi arrived in the United States when she was 13 months old and began her new life. 'I always felt part of the family,' said Shanthi, who would eventually have a total of eight siblings, six of whom were adopted. Her journey toward adulthood would be paved with one amazing accomplishment after the next. She learned to draw and paint with her feet, according to LDSmag.com, and even went on to receive an art degree from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Strong: Mom-of-two Shanthi has learned to use her feet to do the work of her hands, including changing diapers . She met her husband and the father of her two sons, Conrad, at the LDS singles ward she was attending while a student at UNLV. And the rest is heartwarming history thanks to adoption, prayer, and the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. 'I am just grateful for the opportunity to be a mother, and I don’t harbor any resentment for what my [birth] mother did,' said Shanthi. 'She was just a child herself. I don’t know what the circumstances were, but I’m sure in the next life I will receive all the answers to the questions I have.'","Shanthi Kimball's 11-year-old mother stood in front of a train with her in Calcutta in a murder-suicide attempt when she was an infant .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . 'Attacked': V. Stiviano (pictured on her way to New York City from LAX on Saturday) has reported an alleged assault by two men outside a New York City hotel . A man has handed himself in in connection to the allegedly racist attack on V.Stiviano outside a top New York hotel. The 40-year-old Long Island man handed himself in on Tuesday, CNN reported. V. Stiviano reported the alleged assault by two men outside the fashionable Gansevoort hotel in New York on Monday. Stiviano said the row began in nearby Revel restaurant where a group of diners criticized her and she argued back. According to CNN, a man then tried to take a cell phone photograph of her when she knocked the phone out of his hands and left. Stiviano's attorneys Alaleh Kamran and Mac Nehoray say their client was getting into a cab around the corner - outside the hotel - when they were followed by the men and a female companion and the attack took place. One of the men allegedly spat at Stiviano while the other continued the verbal abuse which escalated into both Stiviano and the men shoving each other. Both men then allegedly threw punches at her. 'Ms. V. Stiviano was attacked outside of Gansevoort Hotel by two white males,' a statement released by the law firm said. 'As Ms. Stiviano was getting inside a cab, one of the assailants punched her in the face, calling her a f**** n**** bitch. Moments later, Ms. Stiviano was punched again by the same person while he was yelling 'I am going to slaughter you'. As the assault on Ms. Stiviano continued, some by-standers attacked the assailant. 'Ms. Stiviano was rushed away from the scene and was seen by a private physician upon her return to the hotel. She is badly bruised and swollen on the right side of her face and has some difficulty with her speech.' The men were in the city celebrating the 40th birthday of the man who's now in custody. Two passersby broke up the fight and one of the men fell to the floor. Hotel security called the police, they are still seeking one of the men involved in the fight. Stiviano was in New York to appear on Anderson Cooper's CNN show. NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton had yesterday said his officers had not received any reports of an alleged attack against Stiviano. Because Stiviano and her lawyer Mac Nehoray had not filed a police report, officers had not been investigating the fight.

'We understand that there are now two videos of the assault that have been located,' her lawyer's office said in a statement. 'In . addition, several witnesses have come forward with relevant and . critical information regarding the facts surrounding the incident and . the identity of the assailants.' Stiviano recorded the racist rant that was leaked and led to Sterling's ejection from professional basketball.

The incident highlights a problem at the over-crowded jail, where guards are put at risk due to faulty locks that prisoners have been jimmying with toilet paper and soap. On May 26, convicted killer Norris Speed sneaked out of his cell in the jail's medical wing to make a call when he came across an old acquaintance, Jasmine Jones. Speed, who was sentenced to death for murdering Atlanta police Officer Niles Johangten in 1991, has been held at the jail since July 2011 for ongoing hearings. Jones was booked in October 2011 on murder and robbery charges. Escape: Convicted cop-killer Norris Speed (left) and murder suspect Jasmine Jones (right) had a jailhouse tryst last month when Speed broke the lock on his cell .

'She stated that inmate Speed popped opened the side door and told her to come into his cell. Inmate Jones then stated that she was tempted and let the lust get the best of her so she willingly entered inmate Speed’s cell although she was extremely nervous,' Sheriff's Deputy Michael Watts wrote in an incident report obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

"A 23-year-old waiter is experiencing a slice of the celebrity lifestyle thanks to his resemblance to One Direction heartthrob Harry Styles. Nathan Land, from Walsall in the West Midlands, is stopped by groups of girls on a daily basis. They  are all after the holy grail for One Direction fans: a selfie with Harry. Nathan said: 'I am always stopped when I am out and about, with people asking me for a photo. 'Younger fans get really excited and I . can see them tapping their mum of the shoulder and asking if they can . have a pictures with Harry. I think it is quite funny.' Nathan Land works part time as a waiter and says he doesn't cultivate his similar appearance to Harry Styles at all . Even just walking down the street can prove problematic for Nathan who is stopped by groups of girls on a daily basis, who are all after the holy grail for One Direction fans- a selfie with Harry . Nathan insists he doesn’t try to look like Harry, although he does like to wear white T-shirts and, on occasion, skinny jeans just like the stylish mega star. Nathan said: 'I have naturally curly hair which is Harry’s most famous feature - some people think I have had a perm, but it is all real.' The part-time waiter is often asked to make appearances at children’s birthday parties. And Nathan was once given a £20 tip for serenading one of his customer’s daughters with the One Direction song, ‘One way or another’. Despite his uncanny resemblance to Harry (left), Nathan (right) admits he isn’t the biggest fan of the band . Nathan admits that looking like Harry Styles does help him attract the opposite sex . The part-time waiter is hoping to increase the amount of lookalike work he does . Nathan said: 'She really wanted to surprise her daughter, so she tipped me so I would sing to her - it was really cringey but I still did it and the girl loved it.' But it’s not all adoring fans - the Harry lookalike has said he has had men pick fights with him on nights out. Nathan said: 'A lot of guys hate Harry Styles because their girlfriends like him, so I have had the odd punch thrown at me - but it’s just part and parcel of it.' Nathan admits that looking like Harry Styles does help him attract the opposite sex, although it’s not always worked to his advantage. While the ladies may like his similarity to the star, Nathan says men are less complimentary, and he has even been hit on nights out . Nathan said: 'I was with a girl in Starbucks one time, and everything was going well. Then a middle-aged man who was on his own came over and told me he was having a selfie with me. 'He pushed the camera in front of us, took the pictures and then walked off laughing. It wasn’t the best timing.' The Harry doppelganger enjoys the perks of looking like the megastar and is now hoping to do more professional lookalike work. Nathan said: 'If I can get the work, I would be happy to make more appearances.' There's only one drawback: Nathan admits he isn’t the biggest fan of the band. He said: 'They remind me of summer because their songs always come out then, I’m not a massive fan but I don’t have anything against the band. 'My life has got better because of them, so I can’t really complain.'","Nathan Land, 23, insists he doesn't deliberately try to look like the pop star .

"By . Katy Winter . Though she might look in the family way, Cara Delevingne fans needn’t freak out just yet. The 21-year-old model has been snapped posing with a faux pregnant belly to model her cousin’s line of maternity wear 'In Pig'. Cara cheekily cradled her ‘bump’ and joked around as she pulled faces while pointing at it, with her beloved pet rabbit Cecil poking out of her pocket.

The waif-like model seemed to be naked under a pair of bright blue dungarees with oversized white buttons and appeared to be wearing no makeup with her hair loose and untamed. Just in case you're in any doubt about it, Cara confirmed to the Telegraph that she was not expecting. The model, who recently returned from Marrakech where she helped celebrate her older sister Poppy’s second wedding ceremony, said: ‘My only baby is Cecil.’ Cara’s cousin, and the designer behind In Pig, which creates elegant vintage-inspired maternity wear, Edwina Gieve seemed delighted to have her famous relative endorse her product, saying: ’Cara looks fantastic in our dungarees, one of In Pig's bestsellers. ‘Cecil, the rabbit may be her only baby, but Cara proves our clothes can be worn with or without a bump.’ BFFs Suki Waterhouse (L) and Cara Delevingne (R) were pictured putting on an amorous display as they cosied up in a hotel lobby at the Cannes Film Festival last month .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . This season of 19 Kids and Counting has charted Jill Duggar's courtship with Derick Dillard.

In a clip from the show, which airs at 9pm on TLC, a nervous Derrick, 25, is seen preparing for his date with 23-year-old Jill, the fourth child of Jim Bob and Michelle, who are devout fundamentalist Christians. As he is seen doing his hair and choosing his clothes, he says: 'I went to bed last night, I was just looking at the rain and thinking, wow, I'm gonna propose tomorrow, to Jill, the most incredible girl ever.'Scroll down for video . What happens next... A nervous Derick Dillard gazes at Jill Duggar just moments before he proposes to her . Derick admits that a proposal may not come as a complete surprise to his girlfriend though. 'I have an idea that she, I'm sure, suspects something, cause she's really smart so it's hard to pull anything over on her,' he says. 'So I think she'll be suspecting something but maybe she doesn't know how it's going to happen or what exactly to expect.' Unsure whether to keep the ring in its box, or slip it into a pocket, Derick calls on his mother for advice. She assures him that keeping the ring in the box is the thing to do, and confirms that it cannot be seen when he slips it into his inside jacket pocket.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Junk food companies are getting around a ban on children’s TV advertising by interacting with them on Facebook, an investigation has revealed. Channel 4’s Dispatches found manufacturers of sweets and sugary breakfast cereals were talking to children on social media. Undercover reporters posing as an 11-year-old were wished ‘happy birthday’ by the sweet brands Chewits and Swizzels Matlow, which then went on to promote their products. The companies are exploiting a loophole in the law which bans advertising unhealthy food to children on the television – but not on the internet. Marketing: This is a screen grab from an 'advergame' created by Coca-Cola and apparently aimed at children . Academic research has shown that young children are especially vulnerable to it as they do not have the critical faculty to recognise they are being advertised to. Some brands, including Oreo, Cadbury's and Coca-Cola, are also advertising their wares via games available for children as young as four which are free to download online. Experts said the disturbing new trend would contribute to the country’s obesity crisis and called for the Government to step in. Dr Julian Hamilton Shield, a specialist in diabetes at Bristol University, said: ‘If your product happens to be not particularly good for you and you’re pushing it and it’s got a child friendly message, then surely you’re trying to encourage children to eat poor food. ‘The state needs to have some control over this. It will bankrupt the country eventually, as we won’t be able to afford all the health consequences.’ Gerard Hastings, social marketing professor at the University of Stirling, added: ‘This is about subterfuge to get into the kids’ lives to get into the family life and thereby access to the parent’s pockets. ‘You’ve got a product that might sell, all they’re concerned with is selling it.’ Promotion: The game features a McDonald's restaurant despite the ban on advertising junk food to children . Advertising unhealthy food during children’s television programmes was banned by Ofcom in 2007 in a bid to curb childhood obesity. The measure followed Food Standards Agency research which found a direct link between overweight children and the impact of TV advertising. However, the ban does not cover the internet, meaning many brands have simply switched to targeting youngsters while they play on their computer, tablet or smartphone. Facebook rules stipulate that you must be at least 13 years old to have a profile, but many children lie about their age. The Dispatches undercover team created a profile using the birthday of a 16 year-old, but posted messages online saying they were 11 years old. They identified six brands which they found to be interacting with children on Facebook, and posted messages on their walls about an up-coming 11th birthday. Some of the brands responded by commenting on the post. Chewits wrote back: ‘Happy Birthday for Saturday! Well, we now have chewmix bags which have a random mix of core and Xtreme flavours in them and later this month we will be announcing a very exciting new product so keep your eyes peeled. KEEP CHEWING!’ Swizzels Matlow sent a smiley face and promoted its 'Squashie' gum sweets by writing: 'Did you manage to get those squashies for your party?' Brands including Chewits wished children 'happy birthday' on social . media sites, before pushing their products . Kellogg's Krave, a sugary cereal laced . with chocolate, also indicated that they ‘liked’ one of the child’s . messages posted on Facebook. Many . brands are now also producing ‘advergames’ for children which they can . download onto their computer or smartphone from an online App Store. Programme . researchers found games by Coca Cola, Oreo and Cadbury's that were made . available with a 4+ age on the parental control rating. All three of these brands have previously pledged not to advertise sugary and fattening products to anyone under the age of 12. In . one example highlighted by the programme, Coca-Cola has produced a game . in collaboration with McDonald's called Crabs and Penguins. It features a McDonald's restaurant as part of the scenery, and the game involves getting a crab to collect cola bottle tops. Chewits also has a game featuring a Chewitsaurus, while Swizzles Matlow also have one themed around their sweets, Squashies. Dr . Jennifer Harris, marketing expert at Yale University, told the . programme: ‘The way that companies market to children online is really . very sneaky. Advertising really is most effective when people don’t . think of it as advertising, when they’re thinking of the game they’re . playing.' Ian Barber of . the Advertising Association added: ‘It’s absolutely the case that . advergames are less easily identifiable as an advert than something that . interrupts the programme you’ve just been watching for the last half an . hour. The fundamental point is, is it appropriate?’ When approached for comment, all the companies mentioned said they do not target children with advertising. A . Kellogg’s spokesman said: ‘As soon as we noticed the age we unliked it, . reported the post to Facebook, and sent a note to the girl and her . parents. ‘The post . mentions that it was her eleventh birthday and we accept that this is . something that should have been identified earlier.’ Coca-Cola, . Oreo and Cadbury’s all said their games were aimed at over 12s, with . the latter two saying the 4+ rating had been imposed by the App Store. As a result of the investigation, both Kellogg’s and Chewits have said they will review their social media policies.","Unhealthy food producers use loophole to target children on social media .

Robin Penton attempted suicide March 10 after shooting dead his wife Collen Penton and their three dogs at their Huntsville home.  The exotic bird's neck was snapped. In a suicide note written after killing Colleen, Penton wrote that he killed the dogs (a pointer, chihuahua and Rottweiler) because his wife didn't train them. He said that he killed Colleen and the bird because they both 'talked too much'. Behind bars: Robin Penton, 53, appeared in court on Wednesday after allegedly murdering his wife March 10 . Penton survived the suicide attempt after police arrived on the scene and paramedics rushed him off to the hospital. He was in court on Wednesday as investigators recounted what they found at the crime scene. Authorities were tipped off about the shooting when Penton called his brother to say he had just shot his wife and planned to commit suicide as well. Penton's brother then called police, who showed up at the scene and found two banged-up motorcycles in the garage.

Investigators say she had been shot three times and suffered a fractured skull after being hit over the head with a kerosene heater.

Authorities say he probably would have died had they not immediately gotten help. Penton explained his violent act in suicide notes left behind at the home. He said there was so much blood because he cut Colleen's nose. He said he beat her and then dragged her into the bathroom where he shot her as well as the dogs.

"By . Dan Bloom . Happy: An inquest heard Oliver King, 16, became introverted before taking his own life . A sixth-former who became introverted and withdrawn when he met his first girlfriend was found hanged after spending his final three hours searching for death metal songs on YouTube, an inquest heard. Oliver King, 16, left no suicide note and had never received any medical help for depression or mental illness. However, he texted a friend weeks before his death saying 'I imagine killing myself every day'. Police also found deleted images on his iPod which included the words: 'I’m sorry I want to give up. I’m sorry I want to die. I’m . sorry I want to kill myself.' A coroner ruled he had been going through 'some dark periods' generally and was 'trapped with nobody to turn to for objective advice'. Oliver's parents, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, told the inquest he turned from an outgoing schoolboy into an introvert after beginning his first serious relationship. The teenager began spending little time . at home, lost weight and fell behind with his A-level studies. He had . coursework deadlines the day after he died in February last year and relations with his parents became strained. A year before he died, he began his first serious relationship and began wearing dark clothes, long hair and make-up and listening to a new range of bands, his parents said. The inquest heard Oliver spent three hours on the night he died viewing songs including The Body of . Death of the Man With The Body of Death by Pinkly Smooth, before taking . his own life while his mother was out of the house. After the hearing his father Adrian . King, 43, a management and IT consultant, said: 'I think the music did . contribute to his state of mind. He was hanging out with the wrong crowd . and I believe this lifestyle was more to blame than anything else. 'He had changed his clothes, his music, his address and his face. He was manipulated and felt isolated. 'Anyone who had met Oliver a year before his death would not have recognised him a year later. 'A year before he was a regular 15-year-old. He had friends, was happy with his life, had a good relationship with his parents, was gifted at art and progressing well at school.' But Oliver's girlfriend denied the music was 'dark', as the coroner asked, and instead pointed to the fact the schoolboy 'did not feel comfortable at home' and had been stressed with coursework. Another school friend said he had been teased over his new look. Oliver was found hanging by his mother Diane King, whose attempts to revive him failed and he died in Rotherham Hospital. She told the inquest Oliver, who lived . with his father after the couple divorced, preferred to be at his . girlfriend’s house and stayed out most days and . evenings as well as studying. 'He was very secretive and wouldn’t tell me where he was or where he was going,' said Mrs King. Two weeks before his death he moved back in with his mother, the inquest heard. Outgoing: Oliver pictured when he was on holiday on the Greek island of Zante in 2009 . The inquest heard Oliver’s . relationship may have hit a 'rocky patch' and his girlfriend made 20 . attempts to contact him in a short space of time just before he was . found. A text from Oliver to her read: 'Please, please stay strong you are not leaving.' His iPod contained deleted images with . the words 'everything will be OK in the end, if it’s not OK its the . end.' Another said: 'I have driven myself to the edge. I can't take it . any more.' His girlfriend, whom the coroner asked not to be named, arrived at the house with another boy after Oliver had been found. Happier times: The schoolboy on a 2011 outing . Mrs . King told the inquest: 'She said: ""Is it Oliver? Is he dead?"" She didn’t seem overly . upset. I thought had they split up and is he the new boyfriend.' Det Con Ian Hampshire, who . investigated Oliver’s death, said a fellow pupil told him: 'Oliver felt . trapped and always had to do what his girlfriend wanted to do.' And Mr King told the inquest he and his . ex-wife had clashed with the girl’s parents over the amount of time . Oliver was spending at their house. But . the girl told the inquest Oliver had become 'very stressed' with his . coursework, especially ICT, and he had project deadlines the day after . his death. She said it was . his choice to wear eyeliner but he had not changed his clothes since . meeting her. They shared the same interest in music, including the bands Avenged Sevenfold and Black Veil Brides, but he was not . associated with any particular group. Asked by the coroner if it was 'dark' music she replied: 'Not from my perspective. I don’t see it as dark music.' She added he spent a lot of time with her . because he 'did not feel comfortable' at home, and denied telling him . their relationship was over. Another schoolfriend said Oliver was 'kind and . full of joy' before he returned to school in the September term. 'He had . dramatically lost weight and wore eyeliner,' he told the inquest. 'He was aware there was some . name-calling and ill-feeling from some of the other pupils.' The sixth-former had been struggling . with his schoolwork but improved after a clear-the-air meeting at school, his head of sixth form Patrick Buttrell told the inquest. Mr Buttrell added there was no official dress code for sixth formers but he had asked Oliver to tone down his make-up. 'It was a light-hearted conversation, he gave me a bit of a smile and said he knew it was over the top,' said Mr Buttrell. Oliver in the Canary Islands in 2002. His father claimed music and lifestyle had contributed to his state of mind . The teenager’s death triggered an investigation involving childrens’ services, public health and police in Rotherham. Deputy Rotherham coroner Fred Curtis said Oliver had 'loving and caring' parents and his new relationship had come at the expense of family and friends. 'He was trapped with nobody to turn to for objective advice,' said Mr Curtis. He was 'paranoid' over his relationship with his girlfriend which 'may have reached a rocky patch' in his mind and he was troubled by his schoolwork. The Coroner added: 'He had been through some dark periods and that evening it culminated in a decision, in my view, to take his own life.'","Oliver King became introverted and isolated in his last year, inquest heard .

"By . Associated Press . A former Boulder police officer was convicted Tuesday of killing a bull elk that had become a treasured companion in an upscale neighborhood and whose death sparked marches, prayer vigils and at least one tribute song. A jury found Sam Carter guilty of nine charges. He could face up to six years in prison after shooting the animal known as Big Boy last year as it grazed beneath a crabapple tree, The Daily Camera reported. Boulder animal activist Jessica Sandler applauded the verdict. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Former Boulder, Colorado cop Sam Carter was tried and convicted for illegally killing an elk named Big Boy beloved in the community . 'It is so rare for an animal to get any semblance of justice in our court system,' she told the newspaper. Carter argued that the elk had become dangerously domesticated and was scaring local dogs. But prosecutors told the jury the killing was a case of poaching by an officer who sought to use his position to get an illegal trophy mount. After shooting the elk, prosecutors said, Carter called a friend and former officer to pick up the carcass and butcher it. They also said Carter later forged a tag to pass off the dead animal as road kill. 'They had no right to use their standing as police officers to poach this animal and lie about it,' Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett said. The trial opened with debate over . whether the elk's prior 'bad conduct' could be used as evidence, and . whether jurors familiar with Big Boy could be impartial. Trophy: Sam Carter, left, and his defense attorney Marc Colin, right, listen to prosecutor Fred Johnson's opening statement on May 28th. Prosecutors argued the officer obsessively stalked the beloved elk before killing it in order to mount its head as a trophy . Opposing views: The defense claimed Carter was merely protecting the community's fearful dogs from the 'nuisance' elk. Prosecutors maintained that Carter was a ruthless elk killer who used his position of power to try and get away with the illegal act . 'Sam . Carter is not guilty of anything but trying to protect citizens of . Boulder from a nuisance elk,' Colin said, as some in the packed . courtroom shook their heads. Prosecutors . flashed a photo of the elk looking peaceful in a yard, and later showed . another picture of a uniformed Carter hovering over the animal's . carcass, grabbing its antlers and smiling. Prosecutors say Carter called another officer, Brent Curnow, to come cart away the body in his pickup truck, and together they butchered the animal for its meat. Curnow pleaded guilty last year to tampering with evidence and other charges and is expected to testify against Carter. The officers swapped text messages about 'hunting' for 'wapiti,' the Shawnee word for elk. The exchanges culminated with a stark message from Carter to Curnow well before Carter's shift began: 'He's gonna die.' Nestled against the foothills and home to a Buddhist university, Boulder is known for its love of the outdoors. Its residents routinely rank among the country's most fit. Witnesses said the sight of the hulking animal was a highlight of countless hikes and jogs. 'Maybe we're strange, but the philosophy up here is live and let live,' pet supply store owner Mary Lee Withers told The Associated Press in an interview. 'That elk never did anything.'

Withers would encounter the elk on walks with her St. Bernard. Her neighbors sometimes found it sleeping in their yards. She is helping raise money for a memorial bench, which she said will be cut from sandstone and have porcelain inlays bearing the elk's likeness. The case also inspired a Boulder man's tribute song, 'Reason to Kill (Ballad of Big Boy).' Its visceral lyrics include: 'Gunned down for nothing, But his sovereign space, Wrong time, wrong place.' 'He was not a pet, but he was a fixture of Mapleton,' Withers said. 'He had been there for years.' The charges against Carter included three felonies — forgery, tampering with evidence, and attempting to influence a public official. Misdemeanor counts against him included misconduct, illegal possession of a trophy elk, conspiracy to commit illegal possession of wildlife, unlawfully taking a big game animal out of season, and unlawful use of an electronic communication device to unlawfully take wildlife. All nine counts: Sam Carter is hugged by his lawyer, Carrie Slinkard after being found guilty on all counts in the shooting of a trophy elk on Mapleton Hill in Boulder. He faces up to sixyears in prison .","Boulder cop Sam Carter was found guilty Tuesday of illegally killing Big Boy last year and could face up to nine years jail time .
