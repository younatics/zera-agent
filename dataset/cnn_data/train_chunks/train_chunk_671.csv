The inhabitants of Easter Island lived off local rats, according to scientists who analysed the teeth of 41 skeletons. The island, also called Rapa Nui, first settled around A.D. 1200, is famous for its more than 1,000 'walking' Moai statues, most of which originally faced inland. Researchers compared the teeth that had been excavated previously to animal bones unearthed on the island. Inhabitants on the remote Easter Island - famous for its Moai statues (pictured) - lived on rats . By looking at the nitrogen and carbon isotopes of each, they round that Polynesian rats, also known as kiore, was one of the main sources of protein in the first few centuries of the island's history. The rat is somewhat smaller than European rats and, according to ethnographic accounts, tasty to eat. Located in the South Pacific, Rapa Nui is the most isolated inhabited landmass on Earth and the closest inhabitants are located on the Pitcairn Islands about 1,200 miles to the west. The researchers were also able to radiocarbon date 26 of the teeth remains, allowing them to plot how the diet on the island changed over time. Radiocarbon dating works by measuring the decay of carbon-14, allowing a date range to be assigned to each individual. Report co-author John Dudgeon, from Idaho State University, told LiveScience that rats should not be underestimated in their value as a food resource. Researchers said catching a rat to eat may have been easier - and tastier - than catching a fish . He said for the people who lived on Rapa Nui, 'it was probably easier to go get a rat than it was to go get a fish.' The Polynesian rat commonly travels with humans on ocean voyages and, like any other rat, multiplies rapidly when it arrives on a new island. In some cases, the rats were probably transported intentionally to be used as food, something supported by ethnographic accounts stating that, in some areas of Polynesia, rats were being consumed at the time of European contact. Additionally, previous research has suggested the rats were at least partly responsible for the deforestation of Rapa Nui. The research, which was published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, also found that islanders rarely ate seafood but added to their diet with chickens and C3 plants, such as sweet potatoes, bananas and yams. Scientists compared teeth from 41 skeletons excavated from the island with animal bones found there . Amy Commendador, of the Idaho Museum of Natural History at Idaho State University, told LiveScience: 'Traditionally, from Polynesian cultures you have a heavy predominance of using marine products, especially in the early phase of colonization.' She said one reason people did not eat seafood is that the north of the island contains steep cliffs and would have been difficult to fish from. Its southerly latitude may make it cooler and affect fishing, she said. 'Because of their geographic location and climate conditions, there just weren't as many marine products for them to get,' Commendador said. Some of the skeletons studied by the researchers appeared to eat more fish than others. The reports suggests that fish eaters may have lived on a part of the island where fishing was easier or that eating fish was a mark of having a 'higher status'.","Researchers compared skeleton teeth with animal bones from island .

In my fantasy wardrobe, all the items not only suit me perfectly, but suit each other perfectly, too. They can be worn in any combination, each resulting in a polished, stylish look. But it would cost a fortune to chuck out all your mis-matched fashion mistakes and start over, wouldn't it? Well, actually, no. As the battle for 'non-food sales' between the big-name supermarkets gets ever more intense, so their affordable fashion offerings go from strength to strength. So I set myself a challenge. Could I assemble the perfect capsule wardrobe for autumn - including shoes and accessories - from only supermarket ranges? And could I do so by spending no more than I would on my weekly food shop for a family of four, £150? The results might surprise you... The look: A sweater and trousers under a camel wrap-coat fits perfectly with this autumn's trend for all things ladylike. Why did I pick it? The sandals and sweater can easily be replaced with ankle boots and a polo neck (which you may already own) once winter sets in. Supermarket strengths: F&F is the strongest supermarket for knitwear. This camel number I picked out is sleek and doesn’t look prone to sagging or bobbling. Wow factor: My girlfriends love this look - two of them have already ordered the coat. Styling Tip: Supermarket coats and jackets are sometimes let down by cheap buttons or belt buckles, so pick a style like this with as few fastenings as possible. The look: Leather is big this autumn, as is off-white - so this outfit ticked two boxes. Why did I pick it? The blouse can be swapped for the camel sweater, and the sandals for boots if you have some, when it gets colder. Supermarket strengths: F&F does skirts extremely well, and is also strong on footwear. These sandals are surprisingly wearable. Wow factor: The skirt provoked a mixed reaction among my friends - some felt leather should be left alone by the  over-25s - but I love it. Styling Tips: The skirt is 'pleather'(plastic leather), but is that a bad thing? Real leather skirts and trousers tend to bag around the knees and the bottom. The look: High-end designers sent a myriad of prints down catwalks for autumn/winter 2013. Super-markets have picked up the trend. Why did I pick it? I particularly like the fabric of this dress, which sucks in my body in all the right places. Although it’s only £25, its fabric feels far more expensive. Supermarket strengths: F&F is the strongest brand for dresses when it comes to fabric and fit. Wow factor: My husband was a fan of this dress (no surprises there), but he said the skirt was rather long (no surprises there, either!). Styling Tip: Although this one has thick fabric, supermarket dresses can feel flimsy. If this is the case, go up a size from your usual fitting — the extra fabric will give a more luxurious feel. The look: I love this Audrey Hepburn vibe - I wore it on a night out with some fashion-forward girlfriends who wear high-end High Street or designer clothes. And I didn't feel in the slightest bit self-conscious. Why did I pick it? A special thank you to Asda for producing a pair of tailored trousers that aren't several yards too long (at 5ft 3in, I often struggle with unwanted trouser fabric). Supermarket strengths: George does the best trousers for shorter women. Wow factor: My girlfriends quizzed me relentlessly about the provenance of my outfit. Their final guess was Reiss - they were stunned when I revealed that every item was from a supermarket. Styling Tips: If you choose a boxy-shaped blouse (as opposed to a longer one or something with a ducktail back), then you can wear it tucked in, too. The look: This is my First Lady outfit. I’m channelling Michelle Obama — after all, she understands the ladylike trend better than most. Why did I pick it? There’s a big trend for capes at the moment, so why not try draping your coat to achieve the same effect? Supermarket strengths: Tu at Sainsbury’s is very strong for coats. I picked out this wrap-coat for my capsule wardrobe but was also tempted by a monochrome cocoon coat (a key shape this autumn). Wow factor: This look was a hit with male and female friends. It’s sexy but sophisticated. Styling Tip:  When buying a coat from a supermarket, it’s worth sitting down in it and then looking at the back before you buy it. Some of the cheaper fabrics are very prone to creasing.","Anna Pursglove visited Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's for clothes .

A holidaymaker has described how he was left with agonising second-degree burns after a Thomas Cook air stewardess dropped a flask of scalding hot water on him. James Trotter, 59, had been looking forward to a hard-earned summer trip to Turkey with his wife Ann when he boarded the flight. But moments after take off, the customer care officer was writhing in pain when a stewardess tipped a kettle of boiling water onto his arm, leg and shoulder while trying to pour a cup of tea. Pain: Holidaymaker James Trotter suffered agonising second degree burns which later became infected . Mr Trotter spent his entire 11-day, £2,100 all-inclusive beach holiday to the Barut Hemera hotel in the resort of Side, in bandages, unable to walk along the beach, go to the spa or use the pool after the wounds became infected. The couple are now taking legal action against holiday provider Thomas Cook for the distress and injury suffered. He said: 'It was shambolic. It completely ruined our holiday. The pain was excruciating and I went into a bit of shock. 'It was an accident but I dread to think what the consequences would have been if it had been a small child. 'I now get moodswings and I have a fear of being around kettles.' Traumatic: James Trotter and wife Ann, pictured, say their dream holiday to Turkey was ruined after an stewardess split boiling water on him . Wife Ann, 57, added: 'James had just a T-shirt and shorts on and the skin literally lifted off his arm. 'You could see it shrivel up right away. It was extreme. The crew had very little to offer in terms of treatments or medication. 'There were some foam pads and some cream but there was no first aid cubicle on the plane so we had to treat the wound in the toilet. 'It brings up a whole load of health and safety issues. There were big cracks in the flask and the seal had come off. These things should be checked.' Burns: Mr Trotter had just boarded the Thomas Cook flight to Turkey with his wife when he had the hot water poured on him accidentally . Cabin crew arranged for a paramedic to meet the couple when the flight landed in Antalya before James was taken to a first aid station within the airport. Mrs Trotter, who was left to struggle with luggage on her own, claims that they were then told to pay €40 for her husband's treatment - or face arrest. Despite James' injuries, the couple, from Dumfries, decided to carry on to the hotel where they paid another €140 for a doctor to change his bandages every day. Blistered: Mr Trotter, who also suffered a burn to his leg, is taking legal action against Thomas Cook for the distress the incident caused . To add insult to injury, the couple requested to be seated away from the aisle on the return flight home - only to discover they had been given two aisle seats. They are furious with the way Thomas Cook have handled their complaint after receiving a letter apologising for the 'bad start' they had to their holiday. The company said the complaint had been passed to their legal department but the couple claim to have heard nothing since and are now taking legal action. Mr Trotter said: 'It is coming up to four months since the incident and all we have had is one email and two letters. It has been us chasing it up but they are stalling all the time. 'If someone else had been burned on the plane that day there would have been no treatment for them because they had ran out of burn pads. It's shocking.' Mrs Trotter added: 'I feel we have been brushed aside.  We just want things to be checked properly - and the toilet is not the best place to treat an open wound. 'The staff at the time were very apologetic but that should also have been followed up in a sympathetic manner. 'It shouldn't take three or four months for something to be done.  It has been a big let-down and we won't be travelling with them again in a hurry.' Karyn McPhee, personal injury lawyer for Slater & Gordon, who are handling the legal action, said: 'The couple are distressed and angry at the treatment they received on this holiday with Thomas Cook. 'Mr Trotter suffered severe burns and was left in substantial pain which ruined the holiday for them. 'They do not feel they were cared for in the correct way and instead of relaxing on their dream holiday, they had to endure a holiday from hell.' Thomas Cook confirmed that their legal team are still investigating the incident. A spokeswoman said: 'The safety of our customers is of utmost importance to us, and we are concerned to hear of any incidents reported on our flights. 'We are thoroughly looking into this matter, and we will be in touch with the customer’s legal representatives as soon as possible.'","James Trotter, 59, suffered burns to his arm, leg and shoulder .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 16:07 EST, 20 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:28 EST, 24 September 2013 . Catbird seat: Assad denied on Fox News this week that he had used chemical weapons against his own people, and with the White House seesawing on regime change, he's positioned well to keep his job . A senior White House official told reporters Friday that the Obama administration wants Bashar al-Assad 'remove[d] from power.' But an examination of the government's vacillating position on whether the Syrian dictator must go reveals a schizophrenic policy that has changed at least four times this year. ''There needs to be a political resolution to the civil war that removes Assad from power,' Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said during an on-the-record conference call. That position has been a consistent theme for eight days, but was preceded by two weeks of White House assurances that the possibility of U.S. military action in Syria was not intended to force 'regime change.' In the past six months, a MailOnline analysis reveals, President Obama and his senior aides have said at least seven times that Assad must go, but insisted on at least five other occasions that the U.S. isn't aiming to see him leave. All of those assurances that the White House wasn't angling for regime change came after the August 21 chemical weapons attack that the U.S. and United Nations maintain was the work of Assad's armed forces. During a March 20 joint press conference in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Obama said he believed 'that the Assad regime has lost all credibility and legitimacy.' 'I think Assad must go – and I believe he will go,' the president said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Obama told Bibi and his countrymen that 'the Assad regime has lost all credibility and legitimacy. I think Assad must go -- and I believe he will go.' A somber Jay Carney told reporters on May 29 that 'as a matter of United States policy that we believe that Assad must not continue to rule Syria' What a difference! On August 27 the same Carney insisted: 'I want to make clear that the options that we are considering are not about regime change' He echoed that call the following day in a speech to the Israeli people, saying that 'Assad must go so that Syria’s future can begin.' Two different White House spokesmen followed suit in May. 'We have been making clear as a matter of United States policy that we believe that Assad must not continue to rule Syria, that he has massacred his own people, that he has the blood of his own people on his hands,' press secretary Jay Carney said May 29 in the White House briefing room. Standing in for Carney two days later, his deputy Josh Earnest insisted that 'we have said that Assad must go and that there is no future for him in Syria. 'And that is not just our opinion,' he added, 'but ... that is the will of the Syrian people that they’ve made clear.' The White House was officially silent on the matter through June and July, as a trio of scandals consumed its public oxygen. Even without chemical weapons, Assad's forces would still pack a wallop: Heavy fighting in the village of Kafr Nabuda, Syria included TNT bombs on Thursday . Obama hedged his bets on PBS, saying both that he had 'called for Assad to leave' and that military strikes 'would not help the situation on the ground' Does the Russia-brokered chemical weapons agreement guarantee Assad will stay in power? Reporters are starting to look beneath the surface with questions to State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki about the dictator's 'job security' New revelations about the September 11, 2012 Benghazi terror attack, journalists' complaints that the Department of Justice was spying on them, and the IRS's admission that it had targeted conservative groups for their political beliefs pushed Syria – and most of the administration's other international priorities – to the back burner. After the August 21 chemical weapons attack in the Ghouta suburbs near Damascus, the White House re-engaged. Secretary of State John Kerry is pushing for the UN Security Council to bare its teeth against Assad when it meets next week in New York City . But suddenly, regime change was off the table as Obama tried to persuade Congress to authorize military action to neutralize Assad's ability to launch future chemical weapons campaigns. 'I want to make clear that the options that we are considering are not about regime change,' Carney said on August 28 during his daily press briefing. On August 29, Obama himself offered a diplomatic analysis on the PBS NewsHour that hedged his bets, reminding host Judy Woodruff that he had 'called for Assad to leave and make sure that we got a transitional government that could be inclusive in Syria.' 'What I’ve also concluded,' he quickly added, 'is that direct military engagement, involvement in the civil war in Syria, would not help the situation on the ground.' Obama was 'candid yesterday in his interview,' a senior White House official told journalists a day later, 'about the fact that we're not talking about regime change here.' Rhodes said Sept. 6 in St. Petersburg, Russia during the G-20 economic summit that any action the U.S. might take against Assad 'would not have the aim of accomplishing regime change.' Carney used similar language on Sept. 11 in Washington, saying that 'the potential use of limited military strikes by the United States ... was not designed to precipitate regime change.' But a day later at the same podium, he emphasized that 'it is still our policy and our view that Syria’s future cannot have Assad in the picture.' 'It’s inconceivable,' Carney explained, 'given what he has done to his own people. But this is something that we have said all along needs to be decided in a political settlement.  It is not something that will be decided militarily.' On May 31, Josh Earnest trumpeted an absolutist posture from the White House podium: 'We have said that Assad must go and that there is no future for him in Syria. And that is not just our opinion, but ... that is the will of the Syrian people' ... ... but National Security Advisor Susan Rice flatly assured a left-of-center audience on September 9 that any military action the U.S. might take 'would not aim to topple Assad or, by themselves, to effect regime change' Anti-war demonstrations at the U.S. Capitol and the White House have provided pressure against military intervention, which the administration now says it hopes to avoid . The most recent administration statement about Assad's future, before Rhodes' candid admission on Friday, came during a Sept. 17 State Department press briefing when spokeswoman Jen Psaki was challenged on the Obama government's changing stance. 'Our position hasn’t changed, that we don’t see a future for Assad in – a future in Syria with – that includes Assad,' Psaki fumbled. 'And that hasn’t changed.' A reporter, however, questioned how the administration's choice to pursue diplomacy through the United Nations could result in deposing Assad. 'I understand that you want that to happen,' he said, according to a State Department transcript, 'but this agreement pretty much gives Assad job security, don’t you agree? ... I mean, he is the one that is being tasked with implementing this agreement, so until the agreement is implemented, I mean, he’s the person that will be implementing it.' 'No, I don’t agree,' Psaki countered. 'Our view and how we have – would press this and what we've discussed with our partners, is that any individual, any government that is in place, whether that’s a transitional government, whatever it may be, would be in charge of implementing this.' Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson would seem to disagree. He observed Sept. 15 on CNN's Face The Nation program that 'Assad used chemical weapons and improved his job security. That's not a particularly good message to other dictators.' During Friday's conference call, Rhodes took questions from journalists at PBS, CBS, CNN, The Washington Post, Bloomberg News and the Press Trust of India, but did not call on MailOnline.","A top White House deputy argued Friday for a resolution in Syria 'that removes Assad from power'

A large cluster of jellyfish has forced one of the world’s largest nuclear reactors to shut down after it caused a blockage in the pipes. Oskarshamn nuclear plant closed its third reactor for the second time in one weekend after a giant wave of jellyfish clogged the pipes that bring in cool water to the plant's turbines. The plant in southeastern Sweden closed O3, which at 1,400 megawatts of output is the largest boiling-water reactor in the world. Nuclear reaction: Oskarshamn, southeastern Sweden closed O3 the largest boiling-water reactor in the world, as a result of the jellyfish invasion . This is not the first time operators at Oskarshamn have been forced to close reactors due to jellyfish, and marine biologists say could become more common across the globe. By Tuesday, the pipes had been cleaned of the jellyfish and engineers were preparing to restart the reactor, said Anders Osterberg, a spokesman for OKG, the plant operator. ‘This is not unusual,' he told local newspaper Nyheterna.net. ‘It has previously struck O1 and O2 when we had surface water intake.' ‘There are filters to stop this and we have all the reason to consider what we can do to prevent this. It is a known problem, but the issue is that it was such enormous quantities this time.’ All three Oskharshamn reactors are boiling-water types, the same technology at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant that suffered a catastrophic failure in 2011 after a tsunami breached the facility's walls and flooded its equipment. Dangerous wobbles: Tons of jellyfish blocked the pipes used to cool the reactor's turbines, a phenomenon that marine biologists say could become more common . Last year the California-based Diablo Canyon facility had to shut its reactor two after gobs of sea salp - a gelatinous, jellyfish-like organism - clogged intake pipes. In 2005, the first unit at Oskarshamn was temporarily turned off due to a sudden jellyfish influx. Nuclear power plants need a constant flow of water to cool their reactor and turbine systems, which is why many such plants are built near large bodies of water. Marine biologists, meanwhile, say they would not be surprised if more jellyfish shutdowns occur in the future. ‘It's true that there seems to be more and more of these extreme cases of blooming jellyfish,’ said Lene Moller, a researcher at the Swedish Institute for the Marine Environment. ‘But it's very difficult to say if there are more jellyfish, because there is no historical data.’ Moller said the biggest problem was that there's no monitoring of jellyfish in the Baltic Sea to produce the data that scientists need to figure out how to tackle the issue.","Swedish nuclear plant Oskarshamn was forced to close a reactor .

Letters emerged last night in which Ian Brady reveals the details of four more murders he claims to have committed. In the handwritten letters, the Moors Murderer said he killed two men in his hometown of Glasgow and a man and a woman in Manchester. He also claims the body of missing Keith Bennett is buried in Yorkshire, and not on Saddleworth Moor, near Manchester, where painstaking searches have taken place over many years. The previously unseen letters emerged as Brady was told he must remain in a mental hospital indefinitely after his request to return to prison was refused. A mental health tribunal yesterday concluded the child killer’s mental disorder was severe enough to justify his ongoing treatment at Ashworth high-security hospital. Brady, who was convicted of the murders of five children aged between ten and 17, has made several claims over the years that he killed more victims. In 1987 he wrote to the BBC claiming he had killed five more people. Four of these he confessed to killing in the latest letters, which he had written to Brendan Pittaway, a former journalist he was in contact with while in Ashworth Hospital. Brady describes the four murders as ‘happenings’ and claims he killed a man on ‘waste ground behind the station’, a ‘woman’ in a ‘canal’, a man in Glasgow and another man ‘above Loch Long’, a picturesque sea loch at the mouth of the Clyde. He also gave details of the four alleged murders to Detective Chief Superintendent Peter Topping, who led the search for Keith when Brady confessed to killing him in 1985. The claims were discussed in Mr Topping’s 1989 autobiography, in addition to an 18-year-old youth Brady claimed to have killed and buried on the moors. But the detective said he had serious doubts about whether Brady was telling the truth, and even the killer himself had suggested some of his claims might be ‘figments of his imagination’. According to Brady, Mr Topping told him a ‘mentally retarded man’ had confessed to the killing near the station but was never charged, and the woman found in the canal had been classed as a suicide despite ‘the absence of a suicide note and the presence of a bruise on her head’. Still locked up: A mental health tribunal yesterday concluded Ian Brady's mental disorder was severe enough to justify his ongoing treatment at Ashworth high-security hospital . He alleges the detective told him records at Strathclyde Police did not go back as far as the death of one of the men in Glasgow and the second did not match any reports of missing persons. Brady also claims he gave Mr Topping ‘names, places and methods used’. He writes: ‘My statements were an embarrassment to the police, who, rather than admit irregularities had taken place, will move mountains to cover up.’ In the same letter, dated November 24, 1989, he writes: ‘As for Keith Bennett. The area of the site is in Yorkshire, not [double underlined] Lancashire, and should have been dealt with by the Yorkshire Police. ‘I have already stated my readiness to questioning under Sodium Penthatol [sic] so-called ‘truth drug’, but not [double underlined] by the Manchester Police.’ It is unclear if Brady's claim that . Keith's body is buried in 'Yorkshire, not Lancashire' is in reference to . his disagreement with boundary changes, and does not mean Greater . Manchester Police, who he has a grudge against, have been searching in . the wrong area. Last night it emerged the mental health tribunal process could be repeated almost immediately because Brady has the right to ask the authorities to review his detention every 12 months. Victim: Keith Bennett, 12, was snatched and murdered in 1964 . The tribunal was delayed from last year due to Brady’s ill health, meaning he could ask for another hearing later this year. Under the Mental Health Act, Brady also has the right to challenge yesterday’s decision, which would require a further hearing at an Upper Tribunal. The victims’ families last night branded the tribunal system ‘a farce’ and ‘circus’. Terry Kilbride, 59, whose brother John was killed aged 12 in 1963, said: ‘That he should be allowed to have another tribunal with the huge cost and heartache it has caused is a total farce. 'He uses the system as a plaything. It really does beggar belief.’ In the tribunal, estimated to have cost the taxpayer £250,000, Brady argued he merely suffered from a personality disorder which should not preclude him being returned to a normal prison. The 75-year-old painted himself as a victim, saying the conditions at the hospital in Merseyside were the ‘catalyst’ for his 13-year hunger strike – although the hearing was told he regularly enjoyed cups of soup and toast. He denied eating in secret and refused to say whether he would try to starve himself to death if he was transferred from hospital to a prison. Martin Bottomley, Head of Greater . Manchester Police's Cold Case Review Unit, said: 'In the 1980s, Brady . ""confessed"" to a number of other unrelated murders. 'All these claims were thoroughly investigated at that time and found to be completely unsubstantiated. 'A week hardly goes by when we do not receive some information which purports to lead us to Keith's burial site. 'All of these claims are investigated and it remains our aim to find Keith for the sake of his surviving family members. 'Only one person knows where Keith is buried and he refuses to disclose . that information, preferring to taunt Keith's loved ones, assisted by . those who seek to profit from his manipulative scheming.' He added that the police force has seen similar correspondence between . Brady and his confidantes and advisers, who 'have similar plans to . capitalise on his notoriety after his death'. A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘We have no ongoing inquiries into Ian Brady.’","Ian Brady claims to have committed four more killings in new letters .

Today Hunt told Central London Employment Tribunal that no-one in Channel 4's racing team had acted 'on the grounds of age' when deciding to let McCririck go after 29 years on the programme. John McCririck, centre, with wife Jenny outside London Central Employment Tribunal today - he is accusing former empoyers Channel 4 and IMG of unfair dismissal and demanding £3million compensation . In a statement she said: 'John McCririck's allegation that I am a 'serial age discrimination offender' is untrue.' She went on to say that younger presenters were not better presenters, but admitted that while she could have vetoed the decision to axe McCririck, she decided not to. Cambridge-educated Hunt also said that while she was involved in the decision to replace Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips, 70, with Alesha Dixon, 34, it was nothing to do with ageism. She told the tribunal: 'There were concerns about whether Strictly Come Dancing was in danger of becoming less appealing to viewers... 'In the previous series, there had been concerns about the judges talking over each other and the conversation generally becoming very exclusive'. Hunt said she had instigated an anti-discrimination training programme for staff after she joined Channel 4 in 2011 but she admitted that it was voluntary and that Jamie Aitchison, the sports commissioning editor who had been instrumental in sacking McCririck, hadn't take part. Channel 4's chief creative officer Jay Hunt, left, a BBC chief when former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly won an age discrimination case against the Corporation, denied being a 'serial age discrimination offender' The tribunal also heard from Carl Hicks, the IMG production company's executive producer of Channel 4 Racing, who suggested that McCririck should be dropped from the channel's revamped racing line-up. Hicks, who was brought in to head Channel 4's revamped racing coverage, repeatedly called for the veteran presenter to be dropped, saying that his 'pantomime' presenting was a distraction. He told the tribunal: 'He was not appropriate and there was not an appropriate role for him.' He added: 'I'm very sympathetic to his position but never felt he would be part of the newly enhanced production team from 2013. 'It is not him waving his arms around for tic-tac, that was a distraction. 'John was an eccentric and seen at worst as a loud-mouthed and chauvinistic extraordinaire which was not what I wanted to be part of the team to broaden racing.' IMG executive Carl Hicks told the tribunal that McCririck called presenter Clare Balding 'ravishing' on-screen . He also said he felt McCririck's reality show appearances 'compromised his integrity as a sports broadcaster' but said there was no room for him in his new line-up that he believed would be 'the poshest team in racing'. Hicks' new team includes Clare Balding, who had childhood links to the Queen, and Nick Luck, who went to Harrow. He told the tribunal that McCririck had a habit of referring to his colleague Tanya Stephenson as 'the female, which was disparaging to her', said he called Balding 'ravishing' on-screen, and said he felt strongly that he should not be included in the new team. Arlene Phillips, 70, was replaced on the Strictly panel by Alesha Dixon, 34, but Jay Hunt said it wasn't ageism . Hicks said: 'I did not think his exaggerated presentation style was consistent with a more serious programme and was aware that he had a potential to offend and alienate viewers and potential viewers.' The tribunal also heard that McCririck had 'a tendency to misname jockeys and horses', although Hicks denied it was a factor for dropping him from the team. McCririck is accusing his former employers of age discrimination but Channel 4 and IMG deny the claims. The 73-year-old pundit, known for his flamboyant clothes, facial hair and gold jewellery, believes he was 'sacked by anonymous suits and skirts' because of his age. The hearing continues.","Horse racing pundit McCririck, 73, is demanding £3million compensation after he was axed from Channel 4's racing coverage .

To help keep the users anonymous, the site uses Bitcoins as its currency. With one Bitcoin worth $47.15, Business Insider reporter Dylan Love determined he could buy 10 hits of LSD. Clicking on the LSD product from the dealer 'Lucydrop' reveals that the drug would ship from Canada to anywhere in the world. Using the site's review system, users are able to determine that Lucydrop has been a member of the site  for 11 months and ranks in the top 1 percent of sellers with 94.1 percent positive feedback from more than 300 transactions. And Lucydrop has more than 900 'fans.' Clicking . over to the reviews, Lucydrop's recent customers say things like: 'will . report back post trip,' 'good dealer,' and 'will update with trip when I . return.' FBI agents arrested Ross William Ulbricht, who is accused of operating the secret website, which is believed to have brokered more than $1 billion in transactions for illegal drugs and services . An ad for a meth pipe on sale asks, 'Why embarass yourself and get evil looks at the local Quickimart when your [sic] buying your Paraphernalia?'

'Now you don't have to worry about where you will buy such an item. We have a ton of them and we ship very discreetly and quickly to anywhere in the U.S.' U.S. law enforcement shut down Silk Road and on Tuesday arrested its alleged owner, Ross William Ulbricht, 29, who was known online as 'Dread Pirate Roberts.' He was arrested in San Francisco. Ulbricht, who holds an advanced . degree in chemical engineering, appeared in federal court on Wednesday . and a bail hearing was set for Friday. His lawyer Brandon LeBlanc, a public defender, declined to comment. A Google+ account for Ulbricht had this post on April 9 last year: 'Anybody know someone that works for UPS, FedEX, or DHL?' Criminal network: Ross William Ulbricht, 29, has been arrested in San Francisco over the alleged drug-dealing activities of his website Silk Road . Federal prosecutors in New York charged Ulbricht with one count each of narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, the filing said. 'Silk Road has emerged as the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today,' FBI agent Christopher Tarbell said in the criminal complaint. The site was used by 'several thousand drug dealers' to sell 'hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs,' he said. The site, which has operated since early 2011, also offered tutorials on hacking ATM machines, contact lists for black market connections and counterfeiters, and guns and hit men for sale, according to the charges. More than 900,000 registered users of the site bought and sold drugs using the digital currency Bitcoin. Time's up: The FBI has shut down Silk Road, an anonymous Internet marketplace for illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine and criminal activities such as murder for hire . In recent media reports about the growing popularity of Bitcoin, the Silk Road website has emerged as part of a darker side to the use of digital currencies. Through the site, according to the charges, users could buy drugs and have them shipped to an address. Investigators, posing as regular users on Silk Road, made more than 100 purchases of drugs, which were shipped to the New York area. According to the complaint, Ulbricht, who shortened his alias from Dread Pirate Roberts to DPR when posting on Silk Road's forums, operated the site from San Francisco. It's a piece of data locked in an internet-based network by a complex equation. Once released it can be traded and used like money online and can be purchased with real cash. Many websites are now taking Bitcoins as a form of currency. As well as digital currency, Bitcoin miners enjoy the competitive nature of unlocking the coins. Famous fans include the Winklevoss twins - famous rivals of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg - who own around 1 per cent of Bitcoins - currently worth around $11million. It has been dismissed by some as a Ponzi Scheme and touted by others as the future of money. It is not centrally controlled and it's unique and complex set up means the market cannot be altered or hacked, according to the developers. There are 21 million coins predicted to last until 2140 and their finite nature means they perform more like a commodity, such as gold. The coins first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. They were introduced by an obscure hacker whose identity is a mystery but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto, which is thought to be a pseudonym. Users choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users.Bitcoins can be bought from specialist currency exchanges and online marketplaces such as eBay. At times, he used computers at Internet cafes to access the servers running the website, which employed several technological tools to mask the location of its servers and the identities of its administrators and users. The complaint described other aspects of Ulbricht's online presence: In a Google+ profile, he described himself as a fan of libertarian economic philosophy and posted videos from the Ludwig von Mises Institute, an Auburn, Alabama-based economics institute. Reached by phone in Austin, Texas, Ubricht's parents said they had not known what their son was doing in San Francisco. 'He is a really stellar, good person and very idealistic,' said Ulbricht's mother, Lyn Lacava. 'I know he never meant to hurt anyone.' Ulbricht's father Kirk confirmed his son had received a master's in material sciences from Pennsylvania State University. His thesis was titled: Growth of EuO Thin Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy. 'He did amazing research on crystals and exotic materials they hoped would have some use for humans, Ulbricht said. 'But it was very theoretical stuff.' The complaint against Ulbricht describes a darker side. During one correspondence with a Silk Road user, Ulbricht tried to call out a hit on another user with whom he had a dispute. That user, known online as FriendlyChemist, was threatening to expose the identities of thousands of Silk Road users unless Ulbricht sent him money. 'I wouldn't mind if he was executed,' Ulbricht wrote, offering personal details about his foe, including the fact that he was a married father of three, and the names of the city and province where he lived. In a later post, Ulbricht wrote: 'He is threatening to expose the identities of thousands of my clients.' 'This kind of behavior is unforgivable to me. Especially here on Silk Road, anonymity is sacrosanct.' During the raid, authorities seized $3.6 million worth of bitcoin, which was used instead of cash or credit cards to complete transactions on Silk Road. Facing charges: Ulbricht, 29, is due in court on Friday. He has an advanced chemisty degree and 'very idealistic', according to his parents . The charges against Ulbricht said his website generated sales of more than 9.5 million bitcoin, roughly equivalent to $1.2 billion. Authorities seized the currency by taking control of the digital 'wallets' Silk Road used to store bitcoin. In a corresponding civil asset forfeiture action, prosecutors claimed Silk Road and Ulbricht were liable to the government for the value of all transactions involving drug tracking and computer hacking, as well as for money laundering penalties, and a final amount would be determined at trial. The raid on Wednesday was not the first time the U.S. government has made arrests related to Silk Road. Earlier this year, authorities in South Carolina arrested Eric Daniel Hughes, known on Silk Road as 'Casey Jones', and charged him in state court with drug possession. The Drug Enforcement Agency seized units of bitcoin, which Hughes allegedly used to purchase drugs from the online market. Bitcoin, which has been around since 2008, first came under scrutiny by law enforcement officials in mid-2011 after media reports surfaced linking the digital currency to Silk Road.","Silk Road owner, Ross William Ulbricht, 29, known online as 'Dread Pirate Roberts,' was arrested in San Francisco on Tuesday .

A Muslim family who thought they were buying a cheese and onion pasty were sold one containing a meat they are not allowed to eat . Then the supermarket rubbed salt in the wound by offering a bottle of champagne, which Muslims are not allowed to drink, as an apology. Majid Khan, 28, from Canton, Cardiff, bought the pasty labelled cheese and onion from Morrisons. Yousuf Khan, three, ate the pasty, which contained meat that is banned in his culture . But when his son Yousuf, three, began to eat it he complained about the taste. His parents found the past contained potato and minced beef that was non-halal - the cow had not been ritually slaughtered. Mr Khan bought a total of three pasties, one of which was mislabelled, on special offer for 57p . The Khan family has now attacked the supermarket for their ignorance in making the error . After realising the mistake, he rang the branch of Morrisons in Cardiff Bay where the manager apologised - and caused further insult by offering them a free bottle of alcoholic bubbly in compensation. Two of the cheese and onion pasties were correctly labelled - but the third one actually contained non-halal minced meat . Garage worker Mr Khan, 28, said: 'It is ridiculous and ignorant of our faith - not just once but twice. 'Firstly they should be far more careful with how they label their products, especially when it could contain meat. 'But then it is completely wrong of the manager to then give us champagne when Muslims don’t drink alcohol. 'I feel highly insulted. I don’t want this happening to any other people who are Muslim.' Mr Khan and his wife Nadia, 29, of Canton, Cardiff, said he will never shop at Morrisons again after the humiliating blunder. The pasties were marked down to 19p from their usual price of 85p. Mr Khan said: 'I put it down to human error, everybody makes mistakes. 'But it didn't seem like the manager was really paying attention to the real problem.' Mrs Khan said the pasties were bought for Yousuf and his three older sisters Ruheena, 10, Amara, eight, and Areesa, four. She said: 'I put them in the microwave and gave the first one to Yousuf. 'I heard him moaning a bit and was saying: ""It’s not nice"". 'I looked at the filling and it was brown meat and potato - he’s had a couple of bites by then.' Mrs Khan said it was an awful insult to be offered alcohol as compensation for the meat blunder. Red-faced Morrisons said they were taking the incident seriously and are looking into the error . She said: 'The duty manager said we could come and have a bottle of wine or champagne on the house. 'I’m really disappointed in their response - they didn’t really care. They were ignorant and lazy.' Red-faced Morrisons said they were taking the incident seriously and are looking into the error. A spokesman said: 'Clearly this is not good customer service. 'We apologise for the mistake and any offence caused to Mr Khan and his family. 'We take labelling our products very seriously and we are looking into why this particular product was mislabelled. 'We know we have to be extra careful when labelling meat. 'We have 11 million people coming to our stores every week and we put this down to human error. 'As a result of this incident, we will reinforce the training and standards in the store to make sure it doesn’t happen again.' Morrisons said they are currently in touch with Mr Khan to discuss a more suitable way of compensating his family. Halal are foods that Muslims are allowed to eat or drink under Islamic Shariah law. Meat must come from a supplier that uses halal practices. The slaughter should be performed by a Muslim who must start by invoking the name of Allah.","Khan family from Cardiff was 'highly insulted' by Morrisons supermarket .

Women should start their family by the age of 35, leading fertility experts have advised . Women should start their family by the age of 35, leading fertility experts have advised. The medics and IVF researchers said that family planning shouldn’t be just about avoiding pregnancy - it must also tell women about the risks of delaying motherhood. Without such information, those who are left childless could be ‘haunted’ by their decision to wait. The Newcastle University experts also said women shouldn’t necessarily use their career as an excuse to delay motherhood – as working life doesn’t get easier with age. And they questioned whether today’s couples are less willing to put up with financial hardship than previous generations. Professor Mary Herbert, one of Britain’s leading reproductive biologists, said: ‘The most important message is for women to have their babies before the clock strikes 12. ‘I would be getting worried about my daughter if she hadn’t had a child by 35.’ The stark message, delivered at the British Science Festival comes as growing numbers of women wait to start a family. Nearly half of all babies are now born to women aged 30 and older and the number of children born to women in their late 30s has almost trebled in recent years. Britain’s biggest science conference heard that while some women will be lucky enough to become pregnant in their 40s or 50s, many face heartbreak. Fertility also falls sharply after the age of 35 and IVF far from guarantees a couple a child. Those who do fall pregnant, face greater health risks than younger women – as do their unborn babies. Older mothers are more likely to miscarry, as well as have complicated pregnancies and deliver babies that are underweight or premature. Stillbirths are more than twice as common in over 35s than younger women, while deterioration of their eggs with time also leaves them at greater risk of having babies with Down's syndrome and other genetic disorders. Finally, their age makes them more prone to arthritis, depression, cancer and heart attacks as they bring up their children. Professor . Judith Rankin, who specialises in the health of mothers and their . children, said: ‘The big message is that I don’t think women understand . the risks.’ Jane Stewart, an IVF doctor at the Newcastle Fertility Centre, said that although the message isn’t new, not enough women are aware of it. She said that family planning should involve planning as well as contraception. ‘We all plan families now, use contraception.  Family planning is often seen as a way of avoiding teenage pregnancies, avoiding people being pregnant when they don’t want to be because it doesn’t fit in with their life or social life or whatever else. ‘But family planning has to include when you are going to have your children as well.’ Dr Stewart said that if women are not made aware of the risks of delaying motherhood, they may later bitterly regret their decision. She said: ‘If you look back and regret it, it will haunt you. The medics and IVF researchers said that family planning shouldn't be just about avoiding pregnancy - it must also tell women about the risks of delaying motherhood . Nearly half of all babies are now born to women aged 30 and older and the number of children born to women in their late 30s has almost trebled in recent years . ‘The risk is that you will always be troubled by the “what if”.’ Dr Stewart, who is secretary of the British Fertility Society, also stressed that IVF is far from failsafe. Official figures show that just one in four of the 40,000 women who have it each year have a baby. And, just like natural conception, it becomes less successful with age. The fertility doctor said: ‘I find it heartbreaking when people come to my clinic and say that they put it off for such and such and now it’s not happening and actually I can’t help them either. Fertility also falls sharply after the age of 35 and IVF far from guarantees a couple a child . ‘We can’t get away from the age-related decline in fertility.’ The all-female panel acknowledged the cost of childcare and some companies’ reluctance in allowing women to work part-time.  But they also questioned some women’s reasons for delaying starting a family. Professor Herbert said: ‘From talking to young women, it’s about getting my career established, but in a sense I find that misguided because there is no career that gets less busy as you go on.’ Dr Stewart said: ‘Couples feel they want to be established. They want to own their house, they want to be in good jobs before they start a family.  So the idea of bringing up children is perhaps frowned on in a way that people didn’t think about before.’ Natika Halil, of the Family Planning Association, said: ‘Conversations about planning a family are important as is accurate information about contraceptive choice. ‘Women are mindful of their fertility and any discussion should be done without scaremongering. ‘Fertility doesn’t disappear after 35 and doesn't stop overnight. ’ Josephine Quintavalle, of campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, congratulated the Newcastle team for speaking out. She said: ‘Well done to Newcastle for underlining something that should be very obvious. ‘It is sad that we have to point out the obvious but it is a basic message of nature that fertility is time limited.’","Newcastle University experts said family planning should not just be about avoiding pregnancy - it should also warn of the risks of delaying .

They include types of ingredients, rations of ingredients, color, feel, and more . Science has cracked the code of the nacho cheese Dorito’s ability to keep us coming back for more. Ingredients, fat ratio, texture, and even the brightly colored bags all combine to make Doritos one of the most popular snack chip in existence. While a little sneaky, none of the tricks that make Doritos king make the chip any less irresistible. In fact, Arch West, who invented . Doritos in 1964, spent much of his life adoring his brainchild. When he . died in 2011, his family honored his contribution by tossing the chips . into his grave as it was lowered into the ground. ‘He would think it is hilarious,’ said his daughter Jana Hacker. It takes the perfect texture to give Doritos so much allure, food scientist Steven A. Witherly told the New York Times. Doritos . uses a perfect ratio of fat to deliver its delectable punch: a full 50 . percent of their calories come from fat. This helps boost flavor while . also creating a sensation of the Dorito melting in your mouth. This . sensation fools your body and brain into believing less has been . consumed. The phenomenon is called vanishing caloric density and can . also be found in popcorn, cheese puffs, and cotton candy. Tricky: Doritos made Frito-Lay around $5 billion in 2010 and their unbelievable popularity has now been explained away by science. Taste, mouth feel, sneaky chemicals, and perfect fat ratio make the snack physically hard to resist . Garlic powder and real romano cheese help give Doritos their unique, savory kick. So do the chemicals MSG, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate, lactic acid, and citric acid . Another . aspect of the chip’s mouth feel is found in the cheesy powder. The . flour-fine grind allows the dust to settle into every cranny of the chip . and then all across the tongue. The cheese itself is special, too. Frito-Lay, which manufactures Doritos, uses real Romano cheese where other companies would be likely to use cheaper substitutes. But there’s more than just cheese in the powder. Garlic powder helps add to the bold Doritos taste, as does three different forms of salt. Three other flavor enhancing chemicals are present, as well: monosodium glutamate, disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate. These additives help create a burst of intensely savory flavor. Sublime: The tangy Doritos taste helped make Taco Bell's Dorrito Locos into one the chain's most successful products ever . Citric and lactic acids also keep snackers snacking by encouraging salivation, which according to Dr. Witherly and the Times, stimulates the impulse to eat. When all of the Dorito’s flavors come together, something magical occurs: not a single ingredient’s flavor stands out. With all its ingredients balanced so perfectly, the chip avoids so-called sensory specific satiety—that is, the urge to stop eating after you become sick of the same flavor. The Dorito’s bright bags and colorful coating are the final factors that make Arch West’s chip a favorite for life. ‘I always had them on my shopping list for him, right up to the end,’ his daughter said.","Chemicals, cheese, and colors all add to the magic of Doritos science .

Anti-sleaze campaigners claimed a victory for parents  yesterday as watchdogs finally rebuked ITV for showing nudity before the watershed on one of its flagship reality shows. In a landmark judgment, media regulator Ofcom found the broadcaster broke official rules by showing a  burlesque dancer’s naked bottom before the 9pm cut-off. It said ITV had crossed a ‘clear line’ by showing dancer Scarlet Cuffs stripping to just a feather boa and a necklace during an episode of Britain’s Got More Talent. Scroll down for video . Burlesque dancer Scarlet Cuffs peformed a striptease on Britain's Got Talent - to Ofcom's displeasure . The performer began her raunchy routine by turning her back to the audience and unzipping her gold dress . The episode was repeated three times . before the watershed – including at 1.30pm – and was seen by almost . 350,000 children under 15. It is the first time Ofcom has found . that Britain’s Got Talent or The X Factor has breached its code on what . can be aired before the watershed. The decision follows years of . criticism of its ‘toothless’ regulation of sexualised content and was . welcomed as a clear warning to ITV to tone down the content of its . flagship entertainment shows. Last year, Ofcom decided a similar . burlesque routine by BGT dancer Beatrix Von Bourbon was on the ‘margins . of acceptability’, while a series of raunchy performances on the  X . Factor have failed to draw clear condemnation. As the routine progressed, presenter Stephen Mulhern was seen egging her on from the side of the stage . The bare necessities: As the singer's zip went lower, the denouement of her act became clear . Lower: The Britain's Got Talent audience whooped with delight as the dancer's dress fell to the floor . Covered by MailOnline, this is the shot that angered regulator Ofcom, who said it was unsuitable for children . Now campaigners have urged the . watchdog to fine broadcasters who allow offensive language, violence and . sex before the watershed. Vivienne Pattison of lobby group Mediawatch, . said she was delighted by the ruling, adding: ‘Ofcom put out guidance on . this well over a year ago, but broadcasters simply ignored it. Hopefully this decision will finally make them change their ways. ‘It is a victory for parents who are . concerned about what their children are being exposed to before the . watershed. Finally we have a clear signal that it has got to stop. ‘I want Ofcom to show its teeth by . hitting broadcasters where it hurts. I want to see it backing up its . words with real sanctions.’ Currently Ofcom does not have the power to . impose fines. Nevertheless yesterday’s ruling will be seen by ITV as a . serious rebuke. Scarlet Cuffs – whose real name is . Charlie Knight – first appeared on Britain’s Got More Talent on April . 13. The ITV2 spin-off programme shows footage and auditions not aired in . the main BGT competition. Aired at 8.35pm, the episode showed . Miss Knight, 31, appear on stage in a sequinned dress before singing . Disney hit The Bare Necessities to judges Simon Cowell, David Walliams, . Alesha Dixon and Amanda Holden. She slowly unzipped her dress before . stripping completely, using only a feather boa to cover what remained of . her modesty before turning and wiggling her naked bottom to the . audience. In its judgment yesterday, Ofcom said that, although a series . of one and two-second shots of Miss Knight’s bottom were pixelated, the . measure was ‘of limited effectiveness’ and ‘did not sufficiently obscure . the performer’s naked buttocks’. Judges David Walliams, Alesha Dixon, Amanda Holden and Simon Cowell were startled by the striptease . Judges Alesha Dixon and Amanda Holden were astonished when Scarlet Cuffs' dress fell to the floor .

Up to one in four organised criminals targeting Britain is from overseas, according to a damning Government assessment. Ministers believe they include at least 7,400 so-called ‘high-harm’  foreign offenders linked to violence, drug-dealing and fraud. They want to redouble efforts to throw foreign criminals out of the country under measures that will see immigration officers at every police station. Home Secretary Theresa May will today announce plans to expand a London scheme nationwide to eject thousands more crooks from Britain. Crackdown: Officers of the newly formed National Crime Agency, which launches today nationwide . Officials will identify and process foreign suspects as soon as they are arrested, checking whether they are wanted abroad or are here illegally. Where there is evidence, foreign criminals will be prosecuted, deported and banned from returning for a decade. Computer records of suspected serious offenders will be marked with a ‘red flag’ to prevent them applying for British nationality while they go through the courts. New powers will also be used to force criminals to conduct appeals from abroad to prevent them using human rights laws to remain in the UK. The crackdown comes as the National Crime Agency (NCA), described as Britain’s FBI, is launched today. The £450million agency will be made up of a 5,000-strong force with sweeping powers to hunt down cyber-criminals, drug barons, paedophile gangs and people-traffickers. Its director-general, Keith Bristow, said he wanted criminals  to ‘fear’ his staff and for the ‘bottom to drop out of their world’ when they realise they are being targeted. He pledged to untangle unregulated areas of the internet used by criminals and bring to justice those behind the country’s biggest and most dangerous conspiracies. The agency will use high-tech digital tools and CCTV cameras with face-recognition software to track criminals with greater accuracy and at lower risk. Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured on The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, launches the scheme today . It will also operate an intelligence hub to map and analyse information from every police force, other Government departments and MI5 and MI6. An official analysis of Britain’s criminal underworld due to be published today will say there are more than 5,500 ‘active’ organised crime groups in the country. They are made up of a loose-knit and changing group of around 37,000 offenders, of which up to a quarter are foreign. A successful crackdown on foreign criminals in London led to around 1,000 people being deported in the past 18 months. Officials estimate the total cost of organised crime is £24billion a year, with at least a further £2billion cost from cyber-crime. Such is the threat from cyber-crime that a new computer emergency response team is being set up to protect businesses. Known as GovCertUK, it will be led by officials from GCHQ, the Government’s eavesdropping agency. NCA officials believe that almost 1,400 of the 5,500 organised crime groups commit economic crime, such as ‘pension liberation fraud’ in which victims are persuaded to hand over their pensions by conmen posing as financial advisers.","The National Crime Agency (NCA), Britain's FBI, launches today .

A bride and groom were left speechless at their wedding after the priest carrying out the ceremony stopped to scold photographers standing behind him. A video posted to YouTube captures the moment that the clergyman turns away from horrified bride Noelle Borriello and her fiancé Rob Ruehle to tell the photographers they have to move. It appears that he's been so annoyed by the constant click-clicking of the camera shutters that he feels they are ruining the sanctity of the moment. 'Please, sirs, leave': A bride and groom look shocked as the priest officiating their wedding ceremony turns around to photographers to tell them they have to move or he won't carry on in this grab taken from a YouTube video . 'Please, sirs, leave,' says the priest, a stern look on his face indicating that he is not willing to negotiate. Meanwhile, the bride and groom, who moments earlier had been laughing at a joke cracked by the priest during their wedding in Woodloch Pines, Pennsylvania, begin to look very embarrassed. Asked by one photographer where he would like them to go, the priest responds: 'Anywhere other than here. This is a solemn assembly not a photography session. Please move or I will stop. 'I will stop the ceremony if you do not get out of the way. 'This is not about photography, this is about God.' The awkward moment was posted on to YouTube on Tuesday where it has already been viewed nearly 300,000 times. It has attracted a storm of comment, including some by people who claimed to be first-hand witnesses. Unsuspecting: Moments earlier the couple had been laughing as the priest cracked a joke . One commenter, Kamrul Hasan, was the photographer on the receiving end of the priest's ire. 'Well it's not about how I clicked the shutter and they wouldn't be married. My job was to capture their event beautifully. My intention wasn't to kill or hurt anyone with my shutter clicks. 'That priest was just an ass. This was fun outdoor wedding. That’s the reason they didn’t held their ceremony in the Church.' Mr Hasan told MailOnline that he spoke to the priest before the ceremony began, and was only told not to come into the aisle. 'His . approach was bit wired and rude.  But anyway, I let it go.  Ceremony . started and I was shooting from far angles with 70-200 mm lens. I was . the lead shooter so my job was to get great photos of the couples, . reactions, all kinds of expressions,' said Mr Hasan. 'But . when he said “Please sirs leave……please” I and the videographer were . actually at the back and I was shooting with my 70-200mm lens. I had no . idea why he snapped like that. I didn’t want their wedding day to be . ruined, so I looked at the bride and groom and  I moved on the right. 'At that moment bride and groom was horrified including the wedding party and all guests.' Big day: Wedding photographer Kamrul Hasan said that everyone was horrified by the priest's behaviour . Bride Noelle, now Mrs Ruehle, told MailOnline what happened next. 'We were both just shocked,' she said. 'I thought to myself what is he doing? Rob was shocked also but more concerned about how I felt which is why he looked over to me. He knew how much a religious ceremony meant to me. 'The rest of ceremony went on as we had rehearsed the night before. We only got married this past Saturday the 14th so we haven't seen any of the video yet. We were just sent the small clip that is on YouTube.' She said that after the ceremony ended the priest tried to smooth things over with her and her new husband. '[He] explained that he sees a lot of nervous young couples that get distracted by the photography and he wanted to prevent that. In this case though Rob and I were so in the moment we didn't even notice the camera noises.' And thankfully, she added, everyone was able to make light of the situation, despite their shock. 'We were able to laugh about it right away as the bridal party immediately started making jokes and comments about it once the ceremony ended. It became a topic of conversation throughout the night,' she said. 'I had no idea why he snapped like that': Mr Hasan added that, not wanting the couple's day to be ruined, he moved to the right so that the ceremony could continue . But some commenting on YouTube supported the priest's actions. Jaquelynn Brynn wrote: 'I'm a wedding photographer, and generally do not come up front unless requested for a specific shot. 'It's very distracting to everyone. That's what zoom lenses are for. 'He should have had a chat beforehand about his requests, but I don't blame him for asking them to move.'","Angry priest tells photographers to move or he'll stop the wedding .

The keeper, known only as Martin. H, was carrying out a routine feed when the tragic accident happened in front of visitors. He had failed to lock the inside enclosure door properly, which allowed the Siberian tiger to get to him.

Rental mental: Increasing numbers of young people in Britain are choosing not to buy their own properties . An Englishman's house may be his castle - but buying his own could be becoming as much a thing of the past as knights in shining armour. New figures reveal nearly half of young Brits are . no longer interested in owning their homes - bucking a trend that is more akin to French and German renting culture. Today's figures come alongside news that house prices in parts of central London have rocketed by 116 per cent in the past eight years - with Mayfair homes outstripping this at a staggering 139 per cent increase in value. This outpaces the retail price index by . 86 per cent, while the average UK house price has dropped by 19.3 per cent in real terms over the same period. And while an overwhelming 93 per cent of Brits aged between 55 and 75 said they still saw owning their own property as the 'ultimate goal', just a third of under-35s felt the same way. Just over half of Brits aged 35 and under live in a home they do not own, according to the survey by financial protection specialist LV=.. And found 42 per cent . of them are simply not bothered about owning their own home - . even though many said they could afford to. This changing outlook mirrors the culture in Germany and France, where long term renting is the norm. Germany has the greatest proportion of renters in Europe as 61 per cent choose to rent, rather than own their home. It . is seen as a perfectly acceptable alternative brought about largely by . the reluctance of banks to loan money for mortgages - and it’s clear the . UK is now following suit. Only . half of the French live in their own properties - with 52 per cent . renting - due to a boom in property prices in recent years. With British banks also tightening lending criteria, the notion of long term renting is gathering momentum here as well. And while . the previous generation expected to own their first home by the age of . 25, those aged 20 to 35 said they can't see themselves putting down a deposit until . they’re at least 36. Attitudes have changed too, with almost three quarters said the notion that it’s shameful . to never own a property is ‘completely out of date’. More than three quarters of tenants said . the Government's 'Help To Buy' scheme has not motivated them to put a . foot onto the property ladder. And . given the latest figures from London, it's easy to see why even . successful young city workers may be less enthusiastic about finding . their own place. James . Williams is a 32-year-old IT worker from Winchester, Hampshire. He has been renting for . nine years and has no intention of buying his own property. He said: 'I’m happy to continue renting at the moment. It’s such a big commitment to buy my own house. 'It’s so hard to get a mortgage from the bank these days and it’s just easier at the moment to keep renting.'

And . given the latest figures from London, it's easy to see why even . successful young city workers may be less enthusiastic about finding . their own place. Prime . Central London - where prices have more than doubled since 2005 - is made up the affluent areas of Mayfair, Knightsbridge, . Belgravia, Chelsea, Marylebone, Notting Hill, Kensington, South . Kensington. After Mayfair, the top performing area was Knightsbridge, where values are up 133 per . cent compared with eight years ago. It was only in . Kensington and South Kensington that prices didn’t more than double over . the eight-year period - although they still increased by 97 and 88 per . cent respectively. And last week, figures from the Halifax's monthly house price index showed a 5.4 per cent increase in the average value of a home, from £160,292 to £170,231 compared with the same period last year. Figures from LSL Property Services released at the same time showed there had been a 45 per cent increase in the number of first-time buyers in July compared with the same month in 2012. But today's figures show the number of renters has also risen - from 2.4 million in 2005 to 3.8 million in 2011-12. This 58 per cent increase comes despite the rising cost of rent. London living: Park House in South Kensington, . which was recently declared the most expensive house in the capital at . £105 million - 640 times the average house price . The average renter in Kensington and Chelsea is looking at a monthly cost of over £4,000 for a two-bedroom property - although in Bexley in South East London, renters can expect to pay an average of around £830 a month. This was in comparison with the whole of the South East, where the cost of renting - £1,152 per month - consumes almost half of the average person's monthly salary, and £947 per month - 39 per cent of monthly income - in the rest of the country. In the survey of 4,710 Brits, most of those who did not want to buy a house (17 per cent) named not . wanting to be tied down as their main reason for renting instead. After this came being unsure about the area (13 per . cent) and having no desire to buy (10 per cent) are their main reasons. Meanwhile, 7 per cent would rather spend their money on other things than putting it into property. The . majority of 20 to 35 year old tenants - 72 per cent - said they were either married . or in a relationship and earning an average of £34,084 a year. Lucian .

Toxicology tests have revealed Adam Lanza had no alcohol or drugs in his body when he carried out his bloody massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School . Toxicology tests have revealed that Adam Lanza had no alcohol or drugs in his body when he shot and killed 20 first-graders and six women at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14. The tests, conducted as part of the autopsy by state Chief Medical Examiner Dr. H. Wayne Carver II, confirm there were neither illegal drugs nor antidepressants in his body. It isn't known if Lanza, 20, took . medication or used illegal drugs or alcohol. Search warrant records . released by state police do not indicate whether drugs or alcohol were . found when investigators searched the Newtown home Lanza shared with his . mother Nancy. The warrants do indicate that . unspecified medical records were found. Law enforcement sources have . said that Lanza received some psychiatric care at an unspecified point . and that state police obtained those records. Other mass shooters have had histories . of antidepressant use, but then stopped using their medication to have a . clear head during their attacks. Virginia Tech gunman Seung-Hui Cho . had been prescribed Prozac but no traces of the drug were found in his . system after the attack. Lanza's test results support the theory that his attack was focused and well planned. Former FBI profiler Mary Ellen O'Toole told Courant.com that Lanza's test results support the theory that his attack was focused and well planned. 'His thinking was not blurred or flawed in anyway,'' O'Toole said. She said the absence of anything in Lanza's system was consistent with someone thinking that 'I want to kill as many people as I can.' Police warrants indicate that unspecified medical records were found at the house that Adam Lanza had shared with his mother Nancy . Depending on the drug, it can take several days for it to leave a person's system. Anti-psychotic drugs take the least time, while some drugs such as marijuana taking longer. Danbury State's Attorney Stephen Sedensky has said he expects a final report on the state police investigation into the shooting to be released by the end of June. In April it emerged that Lanza had been beaten and taunted by his fellow classmates while he was a student at Sandy Hook Elementary, and his mother had considered filing a lawsuit against the school. Speaking exclusively with the New York Daily News, the relative said that the man who would grow up to murder his mother, Nancy, was viciously bullied by his classmates and would come home from class with bruises over his body. Nancy Lanza was ‘irate’ in her belief that the educators at Sandy Hook weren’t doing all in their power to protect her son, they said. Bullied: A relative of Nancy Lanza revealed in April that Newtown shooter Adam Lanza was beaten up so badly by classmates that his mother had considered filing a lawsuit against the Connecticut school . The relative told the Daily News that . Lanza wouldn’t confide in his mother when she asked him what was wrong. ‘He would just sit there,’ the relative said. Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14 and opened fire killing 26 people, including 20 children, before killing himself. He had killed his mother, Nancy Lanza, in her bed before heading to the school. Documents . released in April revealed how the 20-year-old had sprayed 155 bullets . at innocent children and educators during a five-minute . rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The papers also revealed items seized from the home that Lanza shared with his mother. Investigators confiscated an NRA guide to shooting and . three other self-help books, 'Look at Me: My Life With Asperger's', . 'Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Mind of an Autistic Savant' and 'Train .

Another certificate was found in the home that belonged to Nancy Lanza, 52. In . response, the powerful gun-rights group denied the accuracy . of the police evidence, saying both Lanza and his mother had no links to the group. 'There is no record of a member . relationship between Newtown killer Adam Lanza, nor between Nancy Lanza, . A. Lanza or N. Lanza with the National Rifle Association. Reporting to . the contrary is reckless, false and defamatory,' the statement said. According to its website, the NRA doesn't offer formal certificates for membership. The police dossier compiled in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre reveal Lanza had amassed an astonishing arsenal of guns, with thousands of rounds of ammunition, samurai swords, spears and three photographs of what appear to be a dead person covered in blood. Denial: The NRA has refuted the accuracy of police evidence, denying that Lanza and his mother had links to the group . Search warrant affidavits relating to the Newtown school shootings were unsealed by a judge in Danbury at 9.01am this morning - providing a chilling picture of the mass murderer in the days before he killed 26 people, including 20 children at the Connecticut school in December. The inventory of the evidence . seized from Lanza's home and the car he drove to carry out the massacre . provided glimpses into the world of a troubled young man, but it does . not answer the question of what could have motivated the attack. Investigators say it will take until June or later to complete the . investigation. Chief prosecutor Stephen Sedensky . confirmed that Lanza killed all 26 victims inside Sandy Hook Elementary . School with a Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle before taking his own life . with a Glock 10 mm handgun. He revealed Lanza had another loaded handgun with him inside the school as well as three, 30-round magazines for the Bushmaster. When . his body was discovered, Lanza's Bushmaster was loaded with 30-round . magazine of which 14 bullets still remained in place with one round in . the chamber.

Police and officials stand outside Sandy Hook Elementary School in this aerial photograph a day after the mass shooting at the school in December of last year . Upon entering the school, the police documents state that law officials discovered, 'numerous school children and school personnel located deceased from apparent gunshot wounds in the first three classrooms off the main hallway, adjacent to the school's front entrance'. Adam Lanza's body was found dressed in military camouflage wearing a bullet-proof vest on the floor in the classroom. All the weapons Lanza was carrying were legally owned by his mother, Nancy, 52,  who was discovered dead in her bed on the second-floor of the house she shared with her son with a gunshot wound to her forehead and a rifle on the floor nearby. This new information from the police rules out any suggestion that Lanza tried to buy weapons himself before his massacre - which had been speculated previously. A loaded 12-gauge shotgun was also . found on the backseat of the Honda Civic Lanza drove to the school with . two magazines containing 70 rounds of Winchester 12-gauge shotgun . rounds. The Associated Press and other news outlets have reported previously that Lanza showed interest in other mass killings and authorities found literature on other massacres at his house. There have been reports that Lanza was obsessed with other mass killers, including Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in a shooting and bomb attack in Norway two years ago. Among school shootings in the United States, the death toll from Newtown is second only to the 32 people killed at Virginia Tech in 2007. Malloy announced last week that additional information would be released at his request. He expressed concern that some information about the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook reportedly disclosed by a top state police commander at a recent law enforcement seminar in New Orleans was leaked. 'Like many others, I was disappointed and angered to learn that certain information about the Newtown shooting had been leaked, specifically with concern for the victims' families who may have been hearing this news for the first time,' the governor said in a statement. A column published last week in the New York Daily News, citing an unnamed police officer who attended the seminar, reported that Col Daniel Stebbins discussed evidence that suggested the Newtown gunman studied other mass slayings and dedicated extensive planning to the rampage. The seminar was designed for only law enforcement professionals, and sensitive information dealing with the tactical approaches used by first responders to the Sandy Hook shootings was discussed, Connecticut State Police spokesman Lt J. Paul Vance said. Senate President Donald E. Williams Jr. said this week that legislative leaders hope to review the search . warrant documents before finishing work on a bipartisan bill that . addresses gun control and other issues related to the massacre.","Tests show there were no traces of either alcohol or drugs in Lanza's body when he carried out one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history .

Remembered: The neighborhood has rallied together to raise enough money to install a proper tombstone . 'I hate him so much. I hope he gets what he deserves and I know he will,' she said. The little boy currently has a small grave marker, but the community said this was just not enough and a new tombstone will soon be put at his gravesite. Neighbor Yvonne Casey told WDRB: 'It is very sad, that's why we were pushing to pay for the . headstone and his funeral and now we're in the works of getting a . memorial bench.' Casey is also helping to organize a vigil to remember Leelan, whom 'was abused neglected, murdered, and everybody turned a blind eye,' she said. 'We will fight for justice for you, Leelan,' she added. The vigil, which includes a balloon release and a candle-lit ceremony, will be held next Friday at 7pm at the Crown Hill Cemetery.","Leelan Crain was 'beaten by his mother's live-in boyfriend Jamie Lykins, 24, who pretended the little boy had fallen off the bed'

This heart-wrenching image has captured the incredibly rare moment a mourning elephant says goodbye to her fallen friend. John Chaney, 63, was on a safari trip in Botswana with his wife Diane when they came across the carcass of a dead elephant surrounded by vultures and hyenas. As their guide called park rangers to come and remove the tusks so they wouldn't fall into the hands of poachers, another elephant charged over to the body. The female elephant scared off the animals surrounding the carcass before tenderly placing her trunk around the tusk of the dead male. Mr Chaney revealed how the group were then brought to tears as the female elephant stood guard over the body of her friend for several hours in what appeared to be a moving vigil. Emotional moment: A female elephant holds on to the tusk of a fallen friend with her trunk during a moving vigil which lasted several hours at a wildlife park in Botswana. She had to scare off vultures and hyenas, pictured to the right of the carcass, to get to her friend's body . The amateur wildlife photographer from Houston said he has never witnessed anything like it in all the years he has visited Africa and has never seen anything like it since. He explained: 'We were on a game drive when the park ranger explained one elephant had migrated away from its herd so that it could die. This is typical of elephants when they get too old. 'He said he hadn't seen the elephant in several days when we came across the carcass of a male elephant. It had been there for two or three days. 'There were about 20 vultures and 10 hyenas surrounding it but you could still clearly make out the head and tusks of the elephant. 'The park ranger who was taking us around the reserve called for backup so that the tusks could be removed to prevent them from falling into the hands of poachers. 'As we waited, another elephant charged out of the bush and scared off the vultures and hyenas. Amateur wildlife photographer John Chaney, 63, captured the emotional moment while on holiday with his wife in Botswana . 'She . then tentatively wrapped her trunk around the tusk of the dead elephant . in a slow and graceful movement and remained perfectly still in that . position. 'We watched her for about 20 minutes and there wasn't a dry eye in the house. 'It . was an emotional sight and touching moment, watching this elephant . saying goodbye to her friend, paying her respects much like we would.' Mr Chaney and those in his tour group continued their trip around the park before coming back to the spot where the animal carcass had been several hours later. To their amazement, the female elephant had remained in exactly the same position they had left her in. He said: 'When we came back two or three hours later she was still in exactly the same place, holding the tusk of her friend. 'I have no idea how much longer she stayed there but it was highly unusual behaviour.' While this particular elephant's behaviour is unusual, elephants are known to pay their respects to their dead. Mr Chaney said: 'When a herd of elephants pass a skull of a dead elephant, they have been known to pass their trunks over it as they pass.' He added that the obvious emotion of wild animals in Africa is one of the reasons he and his wife try to visit the region every two or three years. 'You see a lot of human emotions in the magnificent animals of Africa. 'I think Africa is the last place on earth I've seen where animals are still very much in the wild. 'If you go to a zoo the animals are in cages and not acting normally. But if you go on Safari in a range rover in Africa, you're the one in a cage and you can see the animals acting normally.' The picture, taken in 2007, had to be discounted from the 2012 National Geographic Traveler photo contest because of the date it wa staken but received a special commendation.

An Ohio pet owner has been arrested and fined just $25 after police rescued a starving, flea-invested dog that had been chained to a tree for four years. Jeremy Shane Temple was taken into custody from his Middletown home after officers and Butler County Dog Wardens responded to a report that pets were being mistreated at the residence.

Heart-rending sight: Toby the German shepherd, later renamed Joseph, was found chained to a tree in his owner's backyard without food or water . Temple reportedly told suspicious neighbors that Joseph had a disease that made him appear to be emaciated. When confronted by police about the pet's horrific living conditions, Mr Temple allegedly responded, 'the dog is not a human.' The suspect told investigators that he had the German shepherd for four years and usually kept him outdoors. Temple . attempted to explain away Toby's skeletal appearance by saying that . during the summer months, the pooch normally shed a lot of weight. The malnourished pup covered in sores and tick bites was released into the care of the non-profit PAWS Adoption Center, . where staffers renamed him Joseph in honor of the biblical character . who was left for dead by his brothers, only to became a leader.

He has heartworms and a raging ear infection. Investigators say he was chained to a tree for years behind this Middletown home . Meg Melampy, a PAWS volunteer, recalled to the local station WCPO that when she gave the pooch a bath, blood from incalculable flea bites freely ran off his body. 'When I gave him a bath, the blood just ran off of him,' Melampy said. Clinic manager Mike Gigis described it as the worst case of animal abuse he has ever seen. According to Gigis, Joseph came in weighing only about 60lbs, with his fur falling out from malnourishment and most of his teeth knocked out, the station WKRC reported. Gigis said he was shocked when the dog was brought to his clinic. 'There's no excuse for this. None,' Gigis said. 'I mean, you can see, this is the worst' So far, the animal rescue center has spent $1,200 covering the pup's medical costs, which are expected to surpass $2,500. Legal woes: Temple is facing animal cruelty charges for keeping his pet chained to this tree for four years . Road to recovery: Vets and volunteers will try to save the dog and eventually find him a home . Pricey: At this point, the medical bills for ""Joseph"" have added up to around $1,200 dollars. Just the heartworm treatment alone could go as high as $2,500 . Following Temple's arrest, a member of his family even got one of the local residents to write a letter confirming that he had never seen the animal suffering abuse. Beside the $25 fine, Hamilton Journal News reported that Temple also faces charges of cruelty to companion animal, unlicensed dog and improper chaining or tethering. He is due back in court next week. 'He’s feeling a little better now, a little more perky,' West Chester veterinary clinic manager Michael Gigis said. Joseph is said to be doing better these days and is expected to make a full recovery. The plan is ultimately to put him up for adoption.","Officers found the 5-to-7-year-old dog chained to a backyard tree .

Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has another scandal on his hands after Toronto police arrested his occasional driver and security guard. Alexander Lisi, 35, was arrested on Tuesday evening during a raid on an Etobicoke dry-cleaning store. Mayor Rob Ford says he’s 'very surprised' that the man who works for him occasionally is now facing multiple drug charges. Liability? Barely a week goes by without the Mayor of Toronto Rob Ford being involved in some scandal or other . On bail: Alexander Lisi, friend and occasional driver of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, leaves Old City Hall court in Toronto after being granted bail on drug charges . In a statement, Toronto police said . they made the arrests when executing a search warrant in connection with . an ongoing criminal investigation. Lisi is described in reports as a member of Ford’s entourage, but does not serve an official role in the mayor's office. He has been charged with trafficking and possession marijuana and conspiracy to commit an indictable offence. Yesterday, . Mayor Ford held a brief news conference at a gas station near his home . telling reporters that he considers Lisi 'a friend.' Out on bail: Alexander Lisi, has been charged with trafficking and possession of marijuana, according to Toronto police . In the past, Ford has said that Lisi is 'straight as an arrow.' 'He’s . a friend, he’s a good guy and I don’t throw my friends under the bus,' Mr Ford said. 'I’ve never once seen the guy drink, never once seen him . do drugs.' Ford said he was 'very surprised' by the charges, but said he could not say much else because the matter 'is before the courts.' Lisi was released on $5,000 bail along with Jamshid Bahrami, who is reportedly the owner of the dry cleaners. Bahrami is charged with three offenses, including possession of cocaine. Both men are scheduled to appear in court on November 12th. Scandal: A still image allegedly taken from the video given to the Globe and Mail and Gawker.com purportedly shows Ford with two men, one of whom is believed to have been murdered over the video . Lisi’s . name first came to public attention in August, when it was reported . that he and other associates of Rob Ford were under investigation for . their alleged efforts to retrieve a well-known but little-seen cellphone . video that reportedly appears to show Ford smoking crack.

"By . Sara Smyth and Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 19:57 EST, 25 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:20 EST, 26 September 2013 . A packed passenger jet heading to the UK was left flying on autopilot when both pilots fell asleep at the controls, it emerged last night. The terrifying incident happened last month on board an Airbus A330 operated by a British-based airline - but officials are refusing to name the company involved. The pilots - who had apparently slept for just five hours each over the previous two nights - are not expected to face serious disciplinary action over the incident, which highlights the danger of fatigue on flights. Danger: Both pilots on an Airbus A330 similar to this one fell asleep at the controls during a recent flight . The Civil Aviation Authority revealed that the incident took place on August 13 shortly after the 325-seat plane had taken off, when the pilot and co-pilot agreed to take turn having short naps, leaving the plane on auto-pilot. However, one of them woke up to discover that they had both been asleep at the same time, and did not know how long the plane had been unsupervised. The pilots voluntarily reported the blunder to the CAA, which has hidden the name of the airline they work for in a bid to encourage other whistleblowers to speak out. A spokesman for the regulator said: ‘I would be very surprised if any disciplinary action had been taken against these pilots. ‘Perhaps the airline in question may have looked at their rosta or shift system as a result. ‘In potentially critical safety situations like this, we aim to learn from what happened and ensure it will not happen again.’ He added: 'We don't know why the pilots had had so little sleep before this flight. They were taking it in turn to have rest periods, with the one always checking the autopilot and it looks as if both fell asleep at the same time.' Slumbering: The pilots (not pictured) are not believed to have faced serious disciplinary action . By law, airline bosses must report any potentially dangerous conduct to the industry regulator. Virgin Atlantic, which operates a fleet of 10 A330 planes, said: 'Virgin Atlantic can confirm no safety reports have been received about pilots falling asleep simultaneously whilst in control of an aircraft. 'The airline’s primary concern is the safety and welfare of passengers and crew. Virgin Atlantic strictly adheres to and supports all CAA regulations.' Spokesmen for Thomas Cook Airlines and Monarch Airways, which each have three A330s, said that the plane involved did not belong to them. Aviation officials are set to investigate whether some pilots' poor grasp of English is putting lives at risk. Foreign pilots and air traffic controllers are supposed to speak 'Aviation English', the international language of communication in air travel. But reports suggest that many do not speak the language well, leading to potential safety issues which could lead to serious accidents. The Civil Aviation Authority has commissioned a report from expert Barbara Clark of Queen Mary, University of London on the use of Aviation English worldwide. A spokesman said: 'We have seen some recent indications that pilots' proficiency when communicating in Aviation English is not at the necessary level at all times. 'While we have seen nothing to suggest there is a major issue here, as the UK's aviation regulator, safety is our number one priority and we believe it is sensible to examine the issue more thoroughly and have commissioned Dr Clark to do just that.' Dr Clark, a linguist and anthropologist, added: 'This project shows that the UK recognises the need to maintain clear and unambiguous communication in aviation, and is treating it as a serious matter.' Queen Mary said in a statement: 'The project will explore how existing methods of maintaining clarity can be enhanced to reduce or eliminate language-related problems, which can contribute to accidents or serious incidents.' Pilots' union Balpa said that it had . repeatedly warned the CAA about the dangers of pilots feeling overly . tired, and accused the regulator of being 'complacent' about the . problem. General secretary Jim McAuslan said: . 'British pilots want to make every flight a safe flight and tiredness is . the biggest challenge they face. 'As the regulator responsible for UK flight safety the CAA has been far too complacent about the levels of tiredness among British pilots and failing to acknowledge the scale of the underreported problem.' The problem of fatigue among pilots was revealed in a study by Balpa which showed that 45 per cent of the pilots surveyed had suffered from ‘significant fatigue’. The figures revealed that about 20 per cent of pilots believe their performance is ‘compromised’ more than once a week. Many pilots said they now have to fly more than regulation hours to deal with the volume of flights on offer from airlines. Records show that two cockpit crew members fell asleep during a long-haul flight in 2011. One of the pilots was asleep for ten minutes while his co-pilot slept during his break. In another case in 2012, a pilot was unable to gain entry to the cockpit and, after using an entry code to access the cockpit, found his first officer was asleep. While nearly all such cases are resolved without any danger, fatigue has been blamed for high-profile aviation accidents in the past. The pilot of an Air France flight which plunged into the ocean in 2009, killing all 228 people on board, had only one hour's sleep the night before, it emerged this year. Rob Hunter, the head of safety at the British Airlines Pilots’ Association, told the Transport Select Committee last year that often pilots don’t complain about being tired because they are worried about being punished. Balpa claims that new EU regulations on pilots' working hours set to be voted on next week could increase the risk of similar incidents by tiring out workers. Pilots will be able to land an aircraft after going 22 hours without sleep, fly long-haul flights with fewer crew members and operate early-morning flights up to seven days in a row. The union says the changes will 'increase tiredness among pilots and the risk of dangerous incidents'. However, the CAA said today: 'We understand that Balpa are not happy with the proposals but we think overall it is a good package and not much different to what we have now.'","Terrifying incident happened last month on board a British flight .

It is the latest in the 'poopertrator' saga that has left Yale college students bewildered and angry. Berkley students were woken in the early hours of this morning to find a laundry line of soiled T-shirts, pants and towels hung across campus. Not only that, but at 3.35am students received an anonymous email from the alleged 'poopertrator' to inform them of his latest 'masterpiece'. Students at Berkley, which is one of Yales' residential colleges, received the email from 'Copro Philiac' which said: 'Last time, I promise.' Dirty laundry: Ivy League it may be, but someone at Yale University is causing a stink . It was signed 'Forever yours, YP' and . included three photographs of the items of clothing with what looked . like feces smeared over them, the Yale Daily News reports. In a 10:32am follow-up email, the . anonymous 'poopetrator' sent another photograph of the line of soiled . clothes with the comment: 'It’s still a good morning!' News of the 'poopertrator' made . headlines earlier this week after someone at Saybrook residential . college had been urinating into washing machines and even dropping their . feces in. The matter was brought to campus . officials' attention after a student brought physical evidence of the . crime to the Saybrook Master Paul Hudak's office. According to the Yale Daily News, . the pooper has been on the loose since early September, but it wasn't . until student Lucy Fleming showed the evidence - her soiled laundry - to . college authorities that Yale police joined the search. They have not yet commented about the line of dirty clothes. On September 7, Fleming went to Saybrook's laundry room to collect her clean washing from a dryer after it had already been urinated in the laundry earlier in the day. She had rewashed the clothes, but when she removed her clothing from the dryer she realized that they were covered in feces. 'I simultaneously wanted to throw up, cry and punch someone,' Fleming told the Yale Daily News. The serial-pooper quickly became the talk of Twitter, with students dubbing the trending scandal #poopgate2k13. It seems that while not engaged in intellectual pursuits, a person, almost certainly a Yale student, had been throwing food and urine into dryers for some weeks before Fleming's dryer discovery. The recent escalation to fecal matter has college residents watching their clothing for the entire dryer cycle, and some campus colleges fear a spate of copy-cat laundry poopers. Some students, however, are unconcerned about the nefarious laundry-soiler and 'Dirty Laundry' parties have been thrown around the university. Exclusive: Yale is one of the nation's most sought-after colleges . And others have taken a more academic approach to the issue. 'Leave it to YDN, Yale PD, and . the Yale administration to miss a work of art, even when it hits them . like a stinking pile of s**t. This is clearly an act of the avant-garde, not a criminal mind,' wrote a commenter on Yale Daily News, only identifying themselves as 'AnAlumnus'. 'Defying bourgeoisie standards of etiquette, and destabilizing the . hegemonic ""clean/dirty"" binary (which itself is underpinned and . constructed by hidden economic, racial, and gender ideologies) our . intrepid defecator (though perhaps we cannot assume that the artist . recycled his or her own byproduct) juxtaposes the filthy with the . sanitary, making the thought-provoking suggestion that we are all full . of it, always and at all times, even at our most pristine,' wrote the former student and consummate stirrer. According to the Yale Daily News, there have been at least four separate incidents involving human feces in the Saybrook laundry. 'We have asked our students not to leave their laundry unattended, the affected machines have been thoroughly disinfected, and we are actively seeking information about who the perpetrator might be,' Hudak told the News. Dryer disaster: Many students have had their clothing ruined by someone throwing food waste, urine and feces into the dryer with their clean clothes . Hudak also sent an email addressing the matter to students: . 'Dear Saybrugians,' he wrote. 'Someone has been doing weird, creepy, and (frankly) disgusting things in the Laundry Room. This must stop immediately. If you have observed something of this nature, or know who the perpetrator might be, please let me know. I can’t imagine why someone would do these things, but it has got to stop, and we will take measures to be sure it does.' Student Camille Fonseca told the Yale Daily News that students have been standing watch over the dryers to ensure their clothes don't get ruined, and that many students think the college should employ 24-hour security guards in the laundry. 'It’s ruining people’s quality of life,' she said. The search continues for the Yale poopertrator - and when he or she is found, the poop will surely hit the fan.","Someone at a Yale residential college has been urinating and throwing human feces into dryers with other people's clean clothing .

Larry Goodwin, who prefers to be called Sissy, is 67 years old with the build of a linebacker and a fondness for beer, barbecue and rodeo - as well as ruffled skirts and anything with a bow. For years, Goodwin struggled with his compulsion to wear women's clothing, and living in Wyoming, the Cowboy State, with its attendant bigotry and intolerance, didn't help. Whenever Goodwin tried to quash his urge to wear women's clothing - to deny what makes him him - he has suffered breakdowns, depression and suicidal thoughts. Free spirit: The 67-year-old college science instructor Sissy Goodwin just prefers to do most things in a skirt . Many years ago, with the help of his wife Vickie and doctors, Goodwin came to understand his cross-dressing - and to accept himself. But the same can't be said for Wyoming's conservative population. When Goodwin began wearing skirts and blouses in public, he faced hostility at every turn, being kicked out of hotels, stores and restaurants and enduring public ridicule. Despite its self-bestowed moniker, 'The Equality State,'  Goodwin says equality exists only for the majority. Over the years, Goodwin has been beaten and insulted in public, but he says the worst pain has been from people he knows snubbing him in public, and knowing the embarrassment and shame his family has had to endure because of him. 'The physical wounds from a beating eventually heal,'he told the LA Times. 'But the pain of being shunned by people you know lasts a lifetime. It's worse than getting kicked in the kidney.' Being who he is: Sissy Goodwin has spent 30 years fighting intolerance . 'I’ve been arrested in Casper and Laramie for wearing a dress. I’ve been physically assaulted twice. Once in my own front yard I was kicked in the head. Several of my teeth were kicked in and bones were broken in my mouth,' he told the now-defunct Gender Public Advocacy Coalition. 'The other time was at the Kansas City Airport. This man just walked up and blind-sided me, just sucker-punched me. He split my ear wide open, and I was bleeding down the side of my head.' More recently, he says, his own neighbor taunted him for his choice of clothing. 'I baited him - I admit it,' Goodwin told the LA Times, explaining that he asked the man whether he was a coward as well as a bigot. 'He punched me. I might have done the same thing.' Family man: Goodwin is happily married to his wife of 45 years and the couple have two children . Goodwin grew up in the town of Douglas, Wyoming with an alcoholic mother and an abusive stepfather. He told the LA Times that dressing up in girls clothing as a boy gave him 'a safety valve; an escape from a hostile environment.' The compulsion continued into adulthood even as Goodwin became a real Wyoming man's man, competing in rodeos - albeit wearing ladies underpants beneath his chaps - and becoming an Air Force crew chief in the Vietnam War. His secret was discovered while he was on duty in Vietnam when an officer caught sleeping in a pink nightgown. He was given an honorable discharge for the offense. Accomplished: When Goodwin gained the confidence to be himself, he was able to build aircraft, gain a mathematics degree and become a teacher . Cross-dressing is still taboo, even in the country's most liberal cities, but in Wyoming, the country's least populated state, it's particularly loathsome and misunderstood. Wyoming is the state in which college student Matthew Shepard was tortured and killed in 1998 for being gay. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Sissy Goodwin has spent 30 years being exactly who he is. His compulsion isn't linked in any way to his sexuality - Goodwin has been married to his wife Vickie for 45 years and the couple have two grown-up children. Rather, he told the LA Times, it's something he calls gender independence: He just prefers to do most things in a dress. When he was younger, Goodwin didn't know what to call his urge to cross-dress, having never heard the term 'transvestite', so he called himself a GEM - gender enhanced male. 'I don't dress any differently in Salt Lake City or in Latin America than I do at home,' Goodwin says. 'Just because I go somewhere doesn’t change who I am.' Dressed up: Cross-dressing remains a taboo even in the most liberal U.S. states . Larry Goodwin prefers to be called Sissy. He took on the name when a woman called him a sissy, appropriating the slur and possessing it. 'First I was offended,' he told the LA Times. 'Then I saw it: ""That's who and what I am. I wear women's clothes.""' Sissy Goodwin faced another battle 30 years ago when his place of work tried to have him conform to a male style of dress or face termination of his employment. 'I complied for about three months and then I had a nervous breakdown. I saw a therapist and found out through counseling that I am the way I am and that that’s okay,' he told Gender Public Advocacy Coalition. Friends and supporters: Goodwin says he's slowly noticed more acceptance among friends and strangers in conservative Wyoming . 'About that time the union stepped in and said, “This is a good employee, he’s skilled and experienced.” We went into binding arbitration with the company and when we were done I was allowed to keep my job and my dress.' Now, Goodwin turns up to his job as an instructor at Casper College's power technology lab. He tells his mostly male students to call him Sissy and carries his lunch in a pink cooler bag. He . told the LA Times that he has asked his classes to keep an open mind . and not judge him on the way he dresses. Once, his class arrived in . hoodies and removed them in unison to reveal pink ribbons in their hair . and matching pink shirts to show solidarity to Sissy Goodwin. In another encouraging gesture, a stranger recently apologized for driving past him and yelling a slur. Despite . the slow moves forward, Goodwin has no intention of leaving his . home-state of Wyoming. Once, in 1979, after a particularly terrifying . experience when he was arrested in a department store for cross . dressing, he put his house up for sale. But Goodwin changed his mind: 'When . someone doesn't meet their expectations of what a man should be like, . they run him out of town,' he said to the LA Times. 'I wasn't going to go.' Despite the moniker, it's surely no small act of bravery just for Sissy Goodwin to leave his home every morning dressed in women's clothing. Leave the house he does, a man in the Cowboy State dressed as a woman and fighting to be allowed to be who he is. At the state fair this year he felt someone kick him in the behind, and wheeled around to find five cowboys staring him down. Never one to back down from a fight, he pointed to his blouse: 'See that buddy? Don't let it fool you and don't let it happen again.' Sissy Goodwin's advice to anyone facing intolerance? 'We are normal, I’d like to tell them. This is normal. Grasp on to all that you are. We are all individuals, and it’s okay to be different. Go out in public. Confide in your family and friends. Don’t hold your head in shame. Crossdressers should be respected just like any other human being. Just be yourself.'","Larry 'Sissy' Goodwin has been cross-dressing in Wyoming for 30 years .

Quit: John Randall resigned as deputy chief whip days after 'plebgate' files were given to police . A central figure in the ‘plebgate’ scandal that forced Andrew Mitchell out of the Cabinet resigned from the Government last night . John Randall dramatically quit as deputy chief whip, only days after files were given to the Crown Prosecution Service about his former boss, Mr Mitchell. Mr Randall said he had wanted to return to the backbenches since the end of last year. His departure came ahead of a so-called ‘flat cap’ reshuffle expected today or tomorrow, in which David Cameron will promote northern and working-class MPs. Chloe Smith, the constitutional affairs minister, also resigned from the Government last night. Mr Mitchell was forced to quit after he was accused of calling a police officer a ‘pleb’. But CCTV footage of the  exchange at the gates of Number 10 – when he was asked by an officer to get off his bike – cast doubt on that claim. In an exchange of letters with Number 10, Mr Randall praised his ‘fantastic colleagues’, notably Patrick [McLoughlin] and Sir George [Young] – but he left out any  mention of Mr Mitchell. Mr Randall was widely credited with helping ease Mr Mitchell’s departure from government after threatening to quit if his boss remained in post. But a return to the Cabinet is not expected for Mr Mitchell until the Prime Minister carries out a reshuffle at Cabinet level next spring after the European elections. He will also want the police investigation into the plebgate row to conclude. Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, has also been touted as a contender for the chief whip role. Government whips Karen Bradley and Nicky Morgan are expected to become ministers. A source close to Mr Mitchell said: ‘It’s interesting isn’t it that the CPS have just taken possession of all the files.’ Mr Mitchell himself said: ‘I have no comment to make whatsoever.’ Gone: Mr Mitchell was forced to quit after he was accused of calling a police officer a 'pleb' David Cameron moved last night to crush a bid to hold a referendum next year on leaving the EU. Tory backbencher Adam Afriyie, who has been accused of plotting against Mr Cameron, announced plans for an amendment to legislation paving the way for a promised vote in 2017. The Prime Minister has pledged to hold an in-out referendum after renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels if he wins the next election. But Mr Afriyie – who is said to have 25 supporters lined up for a future leadership bid – claims the public is ‘not convinced’ the PM would stick to his promise. He wants to give MPs the chance to vote for a referendum in 2014 when Tory James Wharton’s Government-backed Referendum Bill is debated on November 8. Senior Tories accused him of seeking to ‘destabilise’ the Prime Minister ‘at any cost’. A No10 source said: ‘We will not allow this amendment to be passed.’ In a letter to Mr Cameron, Mr Randall wrote that he had been ‘very lucky to have you as my boss for the last eight years’. In an equally effusive letter, Mr Cameron said Mr Randall had been ‘a rock’. ‘It sounds dramatic, but I had rather hoped this day would never come,’ he wrote. ‘I could not have wished for a more loyal, discreet, patient, trustworthy and committed colleague over the last eight years.’ Miss Smith, the 31-year-old constitutional affairs minister and youngest member of the Government, also quit last night. Her ascent was cut short after she was mauled by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight while serving as a Treasury minister. Miss Smith officially ‘resigned’ from the Government but sources suggest that she was pushed because of a lacklustre performance. More senior sources played down those claims, saying Miss Smith – who recently got married after proposing following a whirlwind four-month romance – had to concentrate on saving her marginal seat at the next election. On Friday, Simon Burns quit as Transport Minister to launch a bid to be Commons Deputy Speaker. Kris Hopkins, the MP for Keighley in West Yorkshire, and Jane Ellison, who grew up in Bradford, are both tipped for ministerial office. Sajid Javid, who was born in Rochdale, is expected to be promoted from his junior Treasury post to the ranks of Ministers of State, one below the Cabinet.

It's the emotionless face of a father being shamed in front of his daughters for a despicable act. Steven C. DeMocker, 59, who was acused of horrifically bludgeoning his ex-wife to death in order to escape alimony payments and claim her $750,000 life insurance policy, has been found guilty of murder. His two daughters, Katie and Charlotte, broke down in tears as the verdict was read out in Yavapai County Courthouse in Prescott, Arizona, following a two and a half day deliberation by the jury. Virginia Carol Kennedy, an artist who was described as 'adventurous, radiant, wise, humble and accomplished', was killed at her home on the night of July 2, 2008. She had been beaten so hard her skull had shattered. Guilty: Steven DeMocker looks back at his daughters in the gallery after being convicted of first-degree murder in the bludgeoning death of his ex-wife . Steven DeMocker's daughter Katie wipes away tears as her father is convicted of the first degree murder of her mother, Virginia Carol Kennedy, in 2008. The prosecution claimed DeMocker - a former high-flying stockbroker who was left debt-ridden by the financial crash - used a golf club, specifically a 7-wood Big Bertha made by Calloway, according to The Daily Courier. While the weapon was never found, investigators recovered the club's head cover. A detailed account of what drove DeMocker to kill Kennedy was heard by the court over the course of the trial, which started in July. DeMocker was a financial advisor at UBS Financial Services who worked solely on commission. At the height of his career he was earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a month. But according to several experts who testified at the trial, DeMocker spent more than he made and had incurred a huge debt. When the economy crashed, DeMocker's take-home was slashed. One month he was paid nothing. His marriage to Kennedy fell apart in the process and, according to an email exchange following their separation, DeMocker was borrowing $20,000 a month from his father to pay his bills. Some of these bills were alimony payments to Kennedy, which were $6000-a-month. DeMocker soon decided he would kill Kennedy, the prosecution said. Viriginia Carol Kennedy was beaten so badly her skull was shattered. Her ex-husband Steven DeMocker has been found guilty of her murder five years after her death. DeMocker's motive was her life insurance policy. She was described by friends as 'adventurous' and 'humble' Prosecutors argued the case without having a confession, eyewitnesses or direct evidence tying DeMocker to the crime. The defense  countered that authorities didn't properly investigate Kennedy's death and tried to direct attention to a man who lived with her at the time but who has since died. DeMocker was found guilty of first-degree murder and six other counts: first-degree burglary, three counts of fraudulent schemes and artifices, evidence tampering, and a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The non-murder charges against DeMocker stemmed from allegations that he arranged to have an anonymous email sent to lawyers claiming drug gang members killed Kennedy. DeMocker also had floated a story about a voice in the vent at the Camp Verde jail after his arrest that said his ex-wife was 'killed by two guys from Phoenix'. Investigators concluded DeMocker concocted the account. DeMocker is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 13. The prosecution have not pushed for the death penalty. He could receive either life in prison or life in prison with a chance of release after 25 years on the murder charge, plus additional time  over the convictions for burglary, conspiracy, tampering with evidence, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and two counts of fraud.","Steven DeMocker, 59, beat ex-wife Virginia Carol Kennedy so badly her skull was shattered .

Britons spend an average of one in 12 waking minutes on the internet – almost twice as long as three years ago, research shows. Surfers use PCs, mobiles and tablet devices to access websites for 43 hours a month, compared with 22 hours in 2010, the year the iPad was launched. Entertainment and social networking sites account for more than a third of all users’ time online. Industry analysts say the rise is down to the launch of tablet devices and greater access to wi-fi. Driving up usage: We access the Internet any way we can at any time - mostly to use social networks . The research was carried out by the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB), which calculated that 46million people in the UK spend one in 12 minutes on the internet. Scott Fleming, of the UK Online Measurement company (UKOM),  which provided figures for the study, said: ‘Technology is the enabler. The introduction of tablets has made it easier to connect to the internet. ‘Any new technology coming on to the market will increase the time spent on the internet so I’m not surprised. 'If we broke the data down by age it would show an even bigger difference, especially among kids, who are driving up usage. He added: ‘The tablet has definitely had an impact and the more providers that come on to the market the more we will see usage go up. 'Smartphones also make it easier to access on the move.’ Around 12.8million people accessed the internet via tablets in the UK this July, according to UKOM. Analysts say the figures reflect the 2010 iPad launch, more WiFi hotspots, and more children using the net . An hourly breakdown of the overall statistics shows Britons spend around 13 minutes on entertainment sites, seven minutes on social networks and blogs, three minutes on emails and two and a half minutes on retail. The rest of the time is spent on online auctions, games, sports and general searches. Mr Fleming said online video consumption was rapidly increasing. ‘If I want to watch an episode of Top Gear on my phone, that’s 60 minutes I’ve spent online,’ he said. The surge in usage has seen online investment from advertisers reach a record high, with £3billion spent in the first half of 2013, equating to £66 per head of the online population. Tim Elkington, of IAB, said the biggest change had been in mobile advertising, which increased from £188million in the first half of 2012  to £429million in the same period  of 2013. He said the total spend on mobile advertising could cross the £1billion threshold for the first time this year. Mr Fleming added: ‘Everyone wins. I am happy I can view content on the move, the advertisers are happy because they can engage with more consumers for more time online.’","In 2010, the year the iPad launched, we were on the web 22 hours a month .

Then he went to see the Thomas Jefferson Memorial and the White House. Finally, returning to the National Mall and, just before 4:30 p.m., he aimed his camera east, toward the Capitol and saw a man pouring gasoline over his body from a canister. Mr Soto says the man gave the Capitol building  a crisp military salute, before igniting the fuel with a lighter . Clean up: Officials responded to the scene in minutes but apparently it was bystanders who were the first to help by taking off their shirts and trying to put the flames out themselves . Important place: The incident occurred in full view of the U.S. Capitol . Shutdown: The Capitol is on high alert in spite of the federal shutdown after a woman slammed her car into one of the barricades following a high-speed chase . Mr Soto kept shooting as flames engulfed the man. ‘I didn’t know what to do in that moment,’ Mr Soto, 39, said. The . entire sequence of events lasted about a minute as other people arrived . and used their clothing to try and smother the flames. The man died on Friday afternoon. His burns were so severe that he has still not been identified, and . authorities will have to use DNA and dental records to trace him. Trouble in Washington: A man reportedly set himself on fire on the National Mall Friday afternoon .

'I . didn't hear a word from him,' witness Adam Stifel told CNN. 'He had . already doused himself with gasoline, I saw his gas can.' Dangerous: The man in question was not identified and his motivation remains a mystery, though the very public nature of the incident hints that it could have been in protest to the government shutdown . The incident took place near the Air and Space Museum and although his motive is not known the chosen location hints that it was a demonstration. The Mall is a national park, making it . one of the hundreds of such sites across the country that have been . closed as a result of the government shutdown. U.S. Park Police sources told MailOnline that the shutdown didn't play into the rescue. Response: Emergency crews were on the scene in minutes . Commotion: The fire incident came just one day after a woman was shot and killed by police after ramming her car into a White House barricade . 'There is no indication that the government shutdown impacted the way anyone responded to this. DC Fire/EMS had people on the scene in, literally, three minutes, and a helicopter transport was there minutes later,' the source told MailOnline. 'We are the lead agency in this investigation, but it will be awhile before we give out details to anyone.'

Business Insider reports Flint’s murder rate is 62 per . 100,000 people compared to 3.8 per 1000,000 in New York City. In addition to . having a high crime rate, Flint is very poor. The abandoned house in a former thriving working-class neighborhood near downtown Flint, Michigan is a far cry from the wealthier houses in the Grand Blanc Township . This decorated home in Grand Blanc, Michigan shares the same zip code as the homes in Flint Michigan . According to city-data.com, 38 per cent of residents live . below the poverty line. Its Median income was also less than $28,000 in 2009. Grand Blanc Township is doing a little better with a median . income of $59,000 compared to $45,000 for the entire state of Michigan. Flint wasn’t always so destitute. In the mid-1900s it had a booming . auto industry after a 1936 auto strike began an era of Union labor. GM employed . 80,000 Flint workers in 1978. In the 80’s GM set up factories in Mexico and by 2006 GM . only employed 8,000 people. Flint’s lack of a major industry caused poverty . rates to soar and people to leave.

Grand Blanc, Michigan is a place people want to live, according to town officials . Now in Flint Michigan, unemployment rates soar even for law . enforcement officials. This lack of authority lends to Flint’s crime rate. There were only 122 police officers in 2012 down from 265 officers five years . ago. That’s only one officer for every 830 people. Drug use has also increased in Flint. Heroin use has . increased in people aged 18-29 as reported by The Flint Journal in 2011. Flint also has a reputation of being a dangerous place for . women. There were 66 homicides against women in 2012 and an 87-year-old woman was raped . outside of her home in the middle of the day. As the going got tough, Flint residents got going. There . were 125,000 people living there in 2000, but that number declined to roughly . 101,000 by 2011. This population decline demonstrates Flint is no longer a . place where people want to live.

The German equivalent of 'cheers' rang out across the drinking halls of Bavaria over the past weeks, as this barmaid served up beers to all and sundry . The so-called Boellerschiessen ceremony was carried out by the traditionally-clad mountain riflemen's association, to bring down the curtain on the festival, which has run since 21 September. The festival, which has just been repeated for the 180th time, reliably draws in some 6million visitors, who polish off some 7.5million litres of beer between them, traditionally served in huge stein glasses which hold almost two pints. Revellers this year will have found the festival pricier than ever, with the average beer clocking in at . €9.66 (£8.15), but the steadily rising prices . But the 3.6 per cent hike is unlikely to have dampened the spirits of this year's revellers, who have taken up the traditional outfits of stretchy leather lederhosen for men and drindl dresses for women more enthusiastically than ever before. Tradition: The floridly-dressed characters of Oktoberfest have been out in force since September 21 . Crowds: More than 6million people thronged the streets of Munich over the duration of the festival . Mass drinking: This beer tent was filled with revellers hunting for one last stein before the festival ended . The folksy get-ups, on sale in the capital for around €50, have been a particular hit among the city's youth, as well as visiting tourists, who would not have touched the old-fashioned gear a few years ago. 'I wanted to be part of the local . atmosphere. Everyone was talking about it,' said Lindsey Zhang, a . 20-year-old from New York who is studying in Paris. She . came to Oktoberfest with her friend Marina Teixeira from Sao Paulo. Both women bought dirndls near the Oktoberfest tents. Old-school: The traditional drindl dress was a popular choice among young women at Oktoberfest . Pricey: Despite their obvious enthusiasm, these beers will have set the revellers back by around £40 . Masses: Huge numbers of drinkers flood the city every year to quaff beer, eat pretzels and dance to oompah music . Keen: This visitor went to extreme lengths to get her hands on a prized stein . 'Everybody told me it would be nicer if I wore it,' Teixeira said. 'Otherwise you'll look like a tourist.' But . today's revival is the most pronounced, said Simone Egger, a professor . in folklore and ethnology at Munich's Ludwig-Maximilians-University. 'It's . taken on a whole new dimension,' Egger told Reuters. She said . globalisation had created a desire for people to seek out local . specialities. Hefty: Vast amounts of meat and bread are also consumed at Oktoberfest . Youthful: Young locals and tourists are also said to be embracing the festival spirit as never before . On trend: Drindls, sported here by these five women, are available throughout Munich for around ¿50 . 'What's old is cool now,' said Isabel Seidel, a 25-year-old student from Berlin at Oktoberfest. Even Pippa Middleton got in on the action, donning a red drindl in Austria for a similar folk festival. The festival, which was originally held entirely in October, has been an important . part of local culture since 1810 when it was first held to celebrate the . wedding of Bavaria's crown prince. Every year the festival starts with the city's mayor - currently Christian Ude - inserting a tap into the first keg of Oktoberfest beer on the first morning. O zapft is! Munich mayor Christian Ude began the festival this year by tapping a keg with the traditional cry . With a traditional cry of 'O'zapft is!' ('It's tapped!'), the festival begins as the mayor hands the first stein to the serving governer of Bavaria. The festival, which also featured pretzels, fairground rides and traditional brass 'oompah' music has become ever more elaborate over the years as more and more people from around the world come in droves to get a taste of the action. More than 6.9million people are thought to have attended the festival this year, though estimates show they are mostly locals, with only 20 per cent of drinkers coming from abroad. The quantity of beer consumed - usually in one-litre 'stein' glasses - is likely to have topped 7.5million litres, and similar awesome amounts of food will have been drunk. It has been projected that 509,000 roast chickens, 59,000 pork knuckles, 116 whole oxen and 85 calves will be consumed during the festival. Based on the average cost of a stein, beer-sellers will have taken more than £61million over the festival. All the steins in Oktoberfest tents are clear glass, so that drinkers can see for certain that their glass has been filled full. Only Munich-based breweries can sell beer in Oktoberfest tents, and they must also meet stringent purity tests. Only six breweries fit the bill at present. And, despite its folksy image, Oktoberfest can also be a rowdy event, German magazine De Spiegel reported that police responded to 201 incidents on the first day of the festival.","Traditional German beer festival has animated Munich since September .

After days of lumbering toward the Gulf Coast, the storm system Karen dissipated Sunday as storm preparations in the region were called off or scaled back. As tides began to recede along coastal Louisiana, crews worked to pick up sandbags and some fishermen took to the water. In Lafitte, the tide had water levels along Bayou Barataria lapping at the edges of piers and sections of the main roadway into the small fishing village prone to flooding. Gregory Ragas, of Davant, Louisiana, holds his one-year-old daughter Jasmine Ragas at an evacuation shelter ahead of Tropical Storm Karen. The East Bank of Plaquemines Parish was under a mandatory evacuation but fears eased Sunday . 'We're very lucky,' fisherman Ken LeBeau said. He added that he was anxious to get out shrimping Sunday - while the tide is up, shrimp may be farther inland; fisherman don't have to venture as far out to catch them. The community has been swamped with flooding by several storms since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Many are just recovering from Hurricane Isaac last summer. Some are in the process of having their homes raised, and Mayor Timothy Kerner said levees are being planned for the area. Rhonda Etienne of Davant, Louisiana, holds her three-month-old niece Nevaeh Etienne in an evacuation shelter in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, in anticipation of Tropical Storm Karen, on Saturday. By Sunday, the storm had moved to east to sea and fears eased . 'It was a blessing from God that we actually dodged a bullet this time,' Kerner said. He estimated that 40,000 sandbags had been put out and said the precautionary measure was worth it: 'It's always easier to pick up sandbags than to clean up a flood.' The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the remnants of Karen were moving eastward off the coast. Forecasters expected what remains of Karen - which had been a tropical storm, then a depression - to continue moving generally east over the next day to two days. Rain accumulations of 1 to 3 inches were expected. Even as residents breathed a sigh of relief, forecasters and emergency officials warned them to keep an eye on developments. As the threat lifted Sunday, Plaquemines Parish closed a shelter where 80 people had taken refuge Saturday. 'We got some rain, no street flooding, so we're looking pretty good. ... We're not expecting any flooding,' parish spokeswoman Caitlin Campbell said. A beach patrol vehicle drives along a nearly deserted coast during a squall in Gulf Shores, Alabama on Sunday. Forecasters said that Tropical Storm Karen dissipated late Sunday morning as storm preparations in the region were called off or scaled back . Wind and waves uncovered tar balls on the beaches of Grand Isle, Louisiana, and crews headed out Sunday to check on them, Mayor David Camardelle Jr. said. He said he was sure they were from the 2010 Gulf oil spill. 'After a spill like that in the Gulf of Mexico, anytime low pressure stirs up the Gulf it comes back and stirs up the oil on the beach. Tar balls have been spread all over. We always expected it,' he said. In an email, BP spokesman Jason Ryan said, 'Should any residual Macondo material appear and require removal, we will retrieve if directed by of Coast Guard, just as is required of any responsible party. We have repeatedly demonstrated our ability to respond quickly following severe weather, and we are prepared and ready to do the same if necessary after this storm.' Vessel traffic at the mouth of the Mississippi River resumed at 12:15 a.m. Sunday, the Coast Guard said. Two cruise ships delayed by the storm were expected at New Orleans on Sunday, Carnival Cruise Lines said in a news release.

The multiday class continued despite the threat from Karen. Although visibility was a little limited, the pair said they had no problems completing their dives. People also enjoyed the beach in Alabama, undeterred by intermittent heavy rains and brisk winds. A few people fished in the surf.

Police have arrested 30-year-old man for breaking into an elderly Oklahoma couple's home and robbing them after the couple's granddaughter made a Facebook posting that led to a tip-off. Police say Michael Lank robbed Beki Akins' grandparents at knifepoint on Tuesday afternoon in their Broken Arrow home and made off with various valuables, including cash, checks, credit cards and the couple's wedding rings. Upon learning about the home invasion, Akins posted a furious Facebook status update with all the details of the crime including a description of the thief's car, his appearance, approximate age and attire. Anti-social: Michael Lank was caught by police after Beki Akins posted about his violent break-in at her grandparents' home on Facebook . Ordeal: Beki Akins' grandparents have been left shaken and traumatized by the burglary at their home . The cause was quickly taken up by the Facebook community and Akins' post was shared almost 10,000 times - 8,000 of those within 10 hours of the crime taking place. Akins' post made it onto the computer screen of Ken Reddick of nearby Tulsa who became suspicious of his brother-in-law Lank. Loving granddaughter: Beki Akins used her Facebook page to spread the word about the break-in at her grandparents' home . 'When I saw the Facebook post, I contacted Akins and her family and spoke with them, then contacted Broken Arrow police and spoke with a detective for a long period of time,' Reddick told Tulsa World. According to News on 6, when police arrived at Lank's home to interview him in relation to the crime, he still had the couple's credit cards in his pockets. Detectives say Lank arrived at Akins' grandparents' home at 1:30pm Tuesday where her grandfather was home alone. He allegedly held the 84-year-old at knifepoint while he walked him from room to room, ransacking the house. 'He physically assaulted my . grandfather multiple times and in great description told him what he was . going to do to him,' Beki Akins' Facebook post reads. 'The threats this man made were so horrific that my granddad will not repeat them.' When Akins' grandmother arrived home from the store, she was also allegedly assaulted by Lank as he made his escape. Lank was arrested Wednesday with bail set at $52,500. News on 6 reports he is also under suspicion for another robbery in September in which he allegedly stole jewelry from friends as they waited for him at a bar and then pawned it. Lank faces charges of first-degree robbery by force or fear, stolen property and false declaration of ownership. Community: Facebook users rallied around Akins, spreading her message far and wide . The Broken Arrow Police Department told Tulsa World that while sharing of information is important for solving crimes, social media speculation can sometimes hinder investigations. 'Friends and family members of the suspect could see that and alert the individual we are out there looking for them,' Calhoun said. 'The suspect then could try to hide, run away or even destroy evidence. We always want the public to contact the police first.' Beki Akins is unrepentant. 'Without the power of social media, this guy would still be on the street trying to hurt someone else,' she told Tulsa World.","Michael Lank, 30, allegedly robbed an elderly couple at knifepoint in their home .

'Our fighters have had huge successes with many attacks. We will be victorious. 'Once foreign forces have been exiled we foresee success.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has accused Congress of 'playing with fire' as the deadline for raising the government's borrowing limit looms. Lew said Congress' failure to increase the debt ceiling to $16.7 trillion before October 17 would be 'dangerous' and 'reckless', and damage the government's credit standing. He said after the deadline, the government will lose the capacity to borrow because he will have exhausted all the extraordinary measures he has been using since May to free up room for more borrowing. Angry: U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said it will be 'dangerous' and 'reckless' for Congress to pass an October deadline without raising the government's borrowing limit . 'On the 17th we run out of our ability to borrow, and Congress is playing with fire if they don't extend the debt limit,' Lew said on CNN’s 'State of the Union' program today. 'We are the strongest, most important economy in the world.. We've already seen that with the government shutdown - the kinds of gridlock and brinksmanship in Washington hurts people, and it hurts the economy.' Lew said the U.S. reached the debt limit in May and Treasury was running out of options to borrow. 'They've been used so many times that they're not as extraordinary as they used to be,' he said. 'If they don't extend the debt . limit, we have a very, very short window of time before . those scenarios start to be played out.' Action: Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has called on House Speaker John Boehner (pictured) to take action, even without majority support from the Republicans . While conservative commentators have accused President Obama of 'digging his feet into the ground' over the issue, Lew said Congress is being inflexible. 'Congress needs to make it possible for us to pay our bills,' Lew said on Fox News Sunday. 'I'm saying the president wants to negotiate. He wants to negotiate in good faith. 'Congress needs to do its job, and we then need to negotiate. The president has taken many steps over the last several years to show his willingness to negotiate. 'He's done it with Democrats saying he's too eager to negotiate. Now, Republicans have not come forward and made comparable movement.' Lew said that the government will have about $30 billion of cash on hand, but it's not a 'responsible amount of cash to run the government on.' Lew also said said that House Speaker John Boehner should take action, even without having majority support for it within his party. 'I know John Boehner. We have a good relationship. I've talked to John Boehner. I know he doesn't want to default. He also didn't want to shut the government down,' Lew said. 'And here we are with a government shutdown. There's a majority in Congress that would vote to do the right thing, and the majority needs to be given the chance to work its will.""'","U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said it will be 'dangerous' for Congress to pass the deadline without raising the government's borrowing limit .

New rules: Under planned legislation, doctors will have to check . that foreign patients are entitled to be in the UK before they are . allowed NHS treatment . Rigid restrictions on free access to health care for immigrants through the NHS are set to be introduced by the Government. Before they are allowed to see a GP or be admitted to a hospital ward, foreign patients will have to prove that they are legally entitled to be in the UK. Students from overseas will also have to pay a 'contribution' to the NHS, according to the Telegraph. A Government source told the newspaper that the restrictions are to be put in place in a bid to crack down on 'people who have no right to be here'. Under the rules, time-limited 'NHS numbers' will be issued to those who are not permanently entitled to stay in the UK, with doctors required to ask patients to prove they are in the UK legally before they can register as a patient. Students from countries outside of Europe will have to pay a £200 fee before they can be treated on the NHS. Hospital bosses will also be told that they must improve steps taken to recover the cost of treatments received by so-called 'health tourists' from abroad. The measures will be proposed in the Immigration Bill, which is due to be presented to Parliament within days. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Telegraph: 'We need to ensure that those residing or visiting the UK are contributing to the system, and that we do as much as possible to target illegal migration. 'We have a National Health Service not an international health service and I am determined to wipe out abuse in the system.' The legislation spans six Government departments, making it one of the most ambitious pieces of legislation to be drafted by the current Government. The bill will also see local authorities banned from giving social hosuing to those with no connection to the area, and hefty fines for landlords who do not carry out proper checks on potential tenants and empoyers who take on illegal workers. Crackdown: The Conservatives hope that the new legislation will redress some of Labour's migration rules and win voters back from UKIP . Foreign criminals will also be allowed to be deported immediately and not afforded a delay by the Human Rights Act - appeals will be heard abroad unless criminals can prove they are in danger of 'serious and irreversible harm' in their own country. The Conservatives hope that the legislation will not only go some way to redressing Labour's migration policy but also see off the challenge posed by UKIP. The Government is also expected to tighten rules regarding unemployement benefits in a separate move.","Foreign patients will have to prove they are legally in the UK before they can be treated .

The footage that sparked the investigation showed Haynes grabbing an inmate named David Wright by the neck from behind. Wright has since detailed more about how Haynes, Graff and Whitcomb treated him and some of the other inmates. He said that the guards would offer him food if he would fight with other inmates or let them punch and kick him. Wright calls these challenges the 'Retard Olympics' for all the 'stupid stuff' he would do for food and coffee. And sometimes, the officers didn't even follow through on their promises of food. Pennsylvania prison: The three men worked at the York County Prison in Pennsylvania. An inmate there says he was forced to fight other inmates in a storage closet to get extra coffee and food . Wright fought other inmates and the guards in wrestling matches organized in a storage closet. During one brawl, Wright says that officer Graff cut off his air supply before he could 'tap out'. He also says that Whitcomb choked him out once, and that Haynes offered him food if he could punch him in the arm. Another time, Wright was punched in the arms and legs by Graff and Whitcomb until they went numb. And it wasn't just fighting. The three men challenged him to drink a gallon of milk in an hour, snort crushed-up candy, drink water laced with pepper foam, get sprayed with pepper foam, eat a spoonful of cinnamon and eat fruit with the peels still on them. The high price of food in prison: An inmate says Whitcomb, left, choked him out on one occasion and that  Haynes, right, offered him food for getting punched in the arm . So far, two of the men have made public statements denying the alleged abuse. 'I did not participate in any of it, and I did not witness any of this,' Whitcomb told The Mercury. 'There is no physical evidence, no medical records. They didn't file any complaints when it was supposed to have happened. This is all on the word of an inmate. It blows my mind.' Graff said it never happened and that he believes the allegations are part of a get-rich-quick scheme. 'They've been telling other inmates that they're going to sue the York County Prison for millions of dollars,' Graff said. 'Personally, I think this is what this is.' The men are members of the Local 776 union of Teamsters, who have filed a complain on their behalf since they have been suspended for three months and there has been no resolution to the allegations. The York County Prison issued a statement of their own on Friday, following the suspensions. 'The actions alleged by Pennsylvania State Police in this case run counter to the professional behavior county and prison management expect and require of all staff. Misconduct within any county agency is not tolerated.'","Corrections officers David Whitcomb, Mark Haynes and Daniel Graff have been put on  unpaid leave as Pennsylvania State Police investigate claims they abused inmates .

Some had travelled miles to galleries and museums across the world to track down their double, before posting photos of their discovery online. One even got into the true spirit of the find by dressing up in a Henry VIII costume similar to the worn by his Tudor counterpart. The man donned an intricate cloak, black hat and poured a glass of wine, before posing in front of a painting of the monarch. He had even cut and shaped his ginger beard to match that of the former King, who is known for having six wives and separating the Church of England from Catholicism.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 11:51 EST, 6 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:17 EST, 6 October 2013 . Unprotected: 58-year-old Theresa Anderson was arrested last year for running a crack-cocaine business out of her family's multiple homes on the same street in Buffalo, New York. Without her, neighbors say the street has become dangerous . For a dozen years, Theresa Anderson was the queen of Deshler Street. The unassuming woman owned five small wooden houses along the poor side street, filling them with her children, grandchildren and other relatives who kept their lots tidy, watched out for trouble and pitched in with the family business. That the family business was selling crack cocaine at all hours of the day and night didn't seem to matter to some of the neighbors, who say their little street on Buffalo's impoverished east side has actually gotten less secure since SWAT teams stormed in and shut down Anderson's drug operation last year. 'I miss Theresa, I really do,' said Debra Walker, who has lived on Deshler for more than nine years. When Anderson was in control, 'I actually felt safer. Now my place has been broken into.' The 58-year-old Anderson, who is set to be sentenced this week to up to 17 1/2 years for conspiracy, was notable for her ordinary appearance. Prosecutors say that's part of what made her an insidious criminal. And neighbors say that's part of why she and her family are remembered more for being valued neighbors than being drug peddlers. Plywood now covers the windows of Anderson's houses, some of which sit side-by-side among the street's 20 occupied homes and overgrown vacant lots, giving Deshler Street even more a feel of abandonment. Neighbor Deanna Gresko said prostitutes and their johns have now invaded the street, something that didn't happen when Anderson and her family were around. 'There was people here. There was people watching,' Gresko said, adding that Anderson 'wasn't a gang-banger drug dealer who would threaten you.' Anderson had no reason not to be nice to those who didn't interfere with her business, said Common Council member David Franczyk, who represents the area. 'It's a sad commentary,' he said. 'It's like the old days of Prohibition when you looked for the mob to keep order on your street. ... But it's a false sense of security. She's bringing criminals into the neighborhood.' Anderson admitted running the Anderson Drug Trafficking Organization, a fittingly business-sounding name for an operation that boasted loyal employees, multiple locations and squashed competition. When SWAT teams raided the Deshler Street drug houses and several others Anderson owned on nearby streets in February 2012, police swept up not only Anderson but also her common-law husband, three adult daughters, two of the daughters' boyfriends, Anderson's son and a granddaughter. All have since pleaded guilty to drug charges. 'It was a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week operation for the last 12 years, and literally hundreds of grams of crack cocaine were sold,' U.S. Attorney William Hochul said. Shuttered: Anderson owned multiple homes on Deshler Street in Buffalo, New York, which she used to run her drug business. Now they are mostly boarded up and abandoned . Michelle Spahn, acting resident agent-in-charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Buffalo, said drugs were stored in and sold from Anderson's homes, and lookouts patrolled the street to alert Anderson to suspected police. 'It was kind of like a monopoly,' she said. 'They used intimidation and violence ...to make sure that the competition didn't come into her neighborhood.' In all, Anderson agreed to forfeit 10 houses, most purchased for less than $10,000, along with $52,000 in cash as part of a plea agreement in June. Eventually, the houses may be sold. As part of the plea, the government is also putting a $1.25 million lien against her and plans to seize anything they can find of hers until that amount is satisfied. Anderson's lawyer, Robert Ross Fogg, did not return calls from The Associated Press before sentencing. He said in court this year that she pleaded guilty to ease the legal burden on her family members. 'Drugs, they take hold of you,' he said. 'They take your soul, and they take your mind.' Dannette Coleman moved to Deshler in February, a year after the raid. She has thought about trying to buy the boarded home next door that Anderson owned. 'I heard there was a lot of drug activity but that she was a nice lady,' Coleman said. 'That she took care of her community.' Spahn is not surprised by that perception in the community. 'The public in general perceives that there is a stereotype' of a drug trafficker, she said. 'When they see her picture, they would probably be very surprised.'","Drug queen-pin Theresa Anderson was arrested last year for running a large drug business out of her homes in Buffalo, New York .

Boston marathon victims joined dozens of amputees to learn how to run with prosthetic legs, only six months after the bombing. Celeste Corcoran, who lost both legs in the explosions at the marathon finish line, joined amputees, their families, volunteers and physical therapists at the Harvard athletic fields on a rainy Sunday morning. Wearing her yellow ‘Boston Strong’ hat, Ms Corcoran navigated her way across the artificial turf on her artificial legs, a volunteer on each arm to keep her upright. Shins no more: Celeste Corcoran (centre), who lost both legs in the Boston marathon bombings, learns how to run with prosthetic legs with the help of Ann-Marie Starck (left) and Gabriel Martinez (right) who has a pair of prosthetic legs of his own . One of her assistants had a pair of prosthetics of his own. Corcoran, pausing to choke back tears, said: ‘I've always wanted to be a runner but I used to get shin splints. ‘I don't have shins anymore, so I'm hoping. No obstacle too tough: Amputee Sarah Reinertsen smiles as she runs an obstacle course at the running clinic . ‘Normally you walk around and you see everybody with two legs. Especially in the summertime - all you see is legs. ‘It's easy to miss yours but when I see everybody here walking and running, it's OK. ‘I just want to be able to do the . things that I did before. ... So many people have my back, I feel like I . can do it. I'm trying my hardest to enjoy being alive.' Dozens . of amputees showed up at the Harvard athletic fields on a rainy Sunday . morning to learn how to run - or run better - with prosthetic legs. Corcoran, from Lowell, Massachusetts, wasn't much of a runner before, but she said she hopes that she will someday be able to join in a 5K or fun run. Her . daughter, Sydney Corcoran, 18, is wearing a matching yellow hat along . with ankle-length tights that showed the effects of the shrapnel that . scarred her legs but did not require amputation. She was on Boylston . Street with her mother when the bombs went off, waiting for her aunt to . finish the marathon. Across the field, a boy with two prosthetic legs, no more than 4-years-old, was learning to kick a soccer ball with the carbon fibre blades. Two older boys wrestled playfully while the bigger one played keep-away with the younger's prosthesis. Two-time Boston Marathon winner Joan . Benoit Samuelson said at the start of the clinic: ‘The most inspiring . stories are at the back of the pack. ‘Our . motto is “There is no finish line.” There are always more challenges . out there. You people who came out today are the spokesmen for those . challenges.’ Organised by . the Challenged Athletes Foundation, which helps amputees and others with . disabilities participate in sports, the clinic brought together . marathon victims, those wounded in the military and other amputees. Coach . Bob Gailey ran them through a series of increasingly complicated . drills, then lined them up for an obstacle course that was the highlight . of the day. Similarly . skilled participants match up in a relay race. Some runners fall; others . have trouble weaving through the cones or stepping around the ropes. But everyone cheered. One woman made her way through the lanes, saying aloud, with a smile: ‘I'm not going to fall this time.’ Another wore a T-shirt that said: ‘I am a Champutee.’ Trying to do everyday things: Heather Abbott (centre), who lost part of her left left in the explosions, has four prosthetics: an everyday leg, a waterproof one for swimming, another that allows her to wear high heels and this running one . Learn to run again: Dozens of amputees turned up to the running clinic at the Harvard athletic fields to learn how to run, or run better, using prosthetic legs . ‘It's inspiring,’ said David Driscoll, a doctor who was working at the marathon's finish line medical tent on race day. Because his son, Brendan, was born with an incomplete tibia and fibula, the elder Driscoll has also volunteered with the Challenged Athletes Foundation. He said: ‘It's very enlightening to see them coming and to see they're overcoming that. It helps me, too, to work through it. ‘I don't say, “There, but for the grace of God, go I.” I say, “How can I be more like them.”' Many of those who lost legs on marathon day have been fitted for the heavy-duty prosthetics they call their everyday legs. Running is easier with the carbon-fibre blades - the ‘cheetah legs’ made familiar by Olympian Oscar Pistorius, but insurance often does not cover them. 'There is no finish line': Two-time Boston marathon winner Joan Benoit Samuelson (left) with Heather Abbott (right) said that participants were inspiring . The Knights of Columbus, which previously provided prosthetics for victims of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, have helped marathon victims get running legs or other prosthetics that help them regain a normal life. Knights of Columbus spokesman Andrew Walther said: ‘We can't let evil have the last word and that's why we focused on this group.’ For Heather Abbott, who had her left leg amputated after the marathon explosions that means four prosthetics: The everyday leg, a waterproof one for swimming, another that allows her to wear high heels, and the running leg she received Saturday. Abbott said: ‘I'm trying to do all the things I used to do.’ Ossur, the prosthetic-maker, donated the blade that serves as Abbott's new left foot. Next Step Bionics and Prosthetics took care of the rest of the prosthetics. The Challenged Athletes Foundation helps with training, with clinics like the one at Harvard on Sunday. So many have my back: Celeste Corcoran (centre) with prosthetist Jerry Scandiffio (left) and Ann-Marie Starck (right) said she is trying hard to enjoy her life and do the things she did before the explosions . Next Step President Matthew Albuquerque said: ‘You can have a running prosthesis sitting in the closet. You have to be trained on it to have its full benefit. ‘I can't tell you how great it is to provide these opportunities for people who never thought they were going to walk again to get out on the field. This is about making people feel good about themselves.’ Abbott stopped midway through the clinic to take off her prosthetic and check for blisters; everything was clear. Putting the leg back on involves a sleeve and a sock and a release valve and some hand sanitizer that's used as a lubricant to create a seal that holds the prosthesis in place. Losing a leg is a self-evident setback and while it's easy to see the damage to the limb it's not always obvious what other problems might come with it. For Roseann Sdoia, who has spent much of the time since Marathon Monday on one crutch or a cane, it can be anything that she needs two hands for, like taking laundry out of the dryer or making a bed. Marathon bombing: Runners continue toward the finish line of the Boston marathon as an explosion erupts in April this year, killing three and injuring more than 260 . Ms Sdoia, who lost her right leg above the knee, said her most recent problem was the emergence of blisters on her leg where it has been rubbing against the socket of her prosthetic. The sores prevented her from getting a running leg this week and left her little to do on Sunday other than sit and watch the clinic, crutches at her side. She said: ‘Today was going to be the day. ‘I was excited to get it, because even if I only took two steps today, I'd take three steps tomorrow. ‘But now,’ she said, sitting under a canopy to stay out of the rain, ‘I'm back to Square One, waiting.’ Two bombs were detonated near the finish line of the Boston marathon on April 15 this year, killing three people and injuring more than 260. Authorities say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, ethnic Chechens from Russia who emigrated to the United States as children, planned and carried out the attack to retaliate against the United States for its involvement in Muslim countries. Tamerlan was killed four days after the marathon following a gun battle with police. Dzhokhar was found wounded and hiding in a boat in a backyard in Watertown. Authorities said he had scrawled anti-American messages on the inside of the boat, including 'The U.S. Government is killing our innocent civilians' and 'We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.'

The eight day old baby suffered a fractured skull and brain damage after he was bitten by the terrier in his table-top carry cot when grandmother Teresa Bell’s back was turned. Mrs Bell had taken the eight-day-old infant downstairs to give his parents, Mikayla Bell, 19, and trainee electrician father Tom Harper, 19, a lie-in. The dog, which had never bitten anybody before and was usually placid, was put down. Figures obtained by the Mirror reveal that the number of attacks is topping 100 a week.

The Government's Dangerous Dogs (Amendment) Bill aims to remove the immunity from prosecution of dog owners whose animal attacks someone on private property. Under the plans for England and Wales, announced in February, a dog owner could be prosecuted if they fail to stop their pet attacking someone on their own, or someone else's property. The Bill was designed to protect people who visit houses as part of their job, such as postal workers, utility staff and healthcare employees. In a separate attack, an eight-year-old boy was attacked by his family’s dog after it stuck its . head through the bars on a stair gate.

Many cat owners recognise their feline friends have a killer instinct, but a scientist believes pet owners are partially responsible for cultivating their cat's wild streak. A British anthrozoologist said that as many owners spay or neuter their tame pets and most kittens are born of stray or feral cats, felines effectively evolve in the wild. He said cats are not as in-tune with human behaviour as their canine counterparts, as dogs have lived alongside humans since the late stone age and are more domesticated.

John Bradshaw said that as cats have only been domestically bred for a few thousand years, they are caught in a generic 'grey area' somewhere in between being a prehistoric killer and a domestic pet. He said human are partly responsible for cats' genetic situation as the less desirable or wild parts of their character stems from humans 'counter intuitive' way of breeding the animals, Medical Daily reported. Dr Bradshaw of Bristol University said tamer cats that are most suited to the domestic environment are the least likely to have kittens as 88 per cent of pet cats are spayed or neutered by careful owners. While this has been billed as responsible practice, he said cats do not become tamer as a domestic generic lineage is largely not allowed to emerge. In fact, 80 per cent of kittens are born . to stray or feral cats, meaning cats effectively living in the wild . pass on their more primitive traits and pets do not become more . domesticated, according to Dr Bradshaw.

The anthrozoologist said cats are not as in-tune with human behaviour as their canine counterparts, as dogs have lived alongside humans since the late stone age . He said that geneticists have found a small number of genes that define the domestic aspects of a cat and 'if we can identify those, then maybe we'll generate a cat that is more suitable for urban living than the current model is'. Dr Bradshaw said that while cats might look regal and sophisticated and owners like to think of them as intelligent and independent, their inscrutable behaviour might occur because of the mixture of modern and ancient animal instinct. 'The cat's domestication is incomplete, in terms of its need to continue hunting and also in terms of its ability to socialise. 'One of the consequences of that is it has a rather unexpressive face.' He also noted that the way cats play indicates they are not completely tame as even as kittens they systematically map their environment and hunt for prey - whether it's rodents or a ball of string - before striking.","A British anthrozoologist said as many owners spay or neuter their tame pets and most kittens are born of stray cats, felines evolve in the wild .

Economist Ms Pryce, 61, says that, like her, most of the women she met inside were serving time because of something men close to them had done . Vicky Pryce has spoken for the first time about her remarkable life behind bars after she was jailed for taking speeding points for her ex-husband, the former Lib Dem Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne. Economist Ms Pryce, 61, reveals how she built up a rapport with many inmates, including lifers and drug dealers. And she says that, like her, most of the women she met inside were serving time because of something men close to them had done. Ms Pryce – who started her sentence in Holloway, Britain’s toughest women’s jail – was inspired by her experiences to write a book about how and  why women end up in prison  – and to express her concerns about the way they are treated there. Her compelling account, entitled Prisonomics, is being serialised in The Mail on Sunday, starting today. Ms Pryce was sentenced to eight months for accepting Mr Huhne’s points. Her admission that Huhne had asked her to  take his points was widely seen as an act of revenge after he  left her and their five children for another woman. He was also jailed, for perverting the course of justice. Ms Pryce spent four days in Holloway, two months at an open prison and two months ‘on tag’ at home. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, she explained why she wrote the book. ‘What really did it was talking to the women in Holloway and realising they were there mostly because of something their husbands, brothers, fathers, had done. Behind bars: Vicky Pryce pictured outside Holloway, where she spend four days before she was moved to an open prison in Madistone, Kent . 'What I thought was that these women . were very vulnerable when they had committed whatever it was they had . committed and in some cases taking the rap for what others had done.’ Women account for only five per cent of the prison population but the number incarcerated increased by 85 per cent between 1996 and 2011. They are generally convicted of less serious crimes than men but the consequences  are much greater, as women tend to be the mainstay of the family. Sent down: An artists sketch of Chris Huhne and Vicky Pryce at Southwark Crown Court as they were sentenced for perverting the course of justice in March this year . Ms Pryce said: ‘For non-violent and . non-serious offences, alternatives to prison might be more appropriate. The book doesn’t give the answers but I hope it puts the debate out . there.’ As she got to know her fellow inmates, . Ms Pryce embraced prison life, taking part in karaoke – and playing . bingo for the first time. ‘I didn’t sing,’ she . laughed, ‘but they did all the usual ones – I Will Survive, stuff like . that. I liked the bingo, it was hilarious. I’d never played before.’ Since her release, Ms Pryce has tried to rebuild her career – even as she was tagged. Support: Vicky with her ex-husband Chris Huhne at the 2010 elections, just months before he left her and their children for Carina Trimingham . She attended a select committee meeting . with her tag – wearing trousers as it was  on her ankle – and since its . removal has thrown herself back into work, attending economics lectures . and debates. She went to the Tory and Lib Dem conferences, and hasn’t ruled out becoming an MP herself. She is also passionate about trying to help women inside prison and on their release, and has become a patron of Working Chance, a women’s charity which helps ex-offenders find work.","Vicky Pryce was jailed for eight months for taking Huhne's speeding points .

Earlier this year it was revealed that Miss Flanders had dated Labour leader Ed Miliband and his shadow Chancellor Ed Balls during the 1990s. Her move to JP Morgan echoes that of former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, who took up a £2million-a-year role working as a part-time advisor for the firm after leaving office in 2008. ‘In many ways, I will be doing the same thing in my new job at JP Morgan Asset Management that I have been doing as Economics Editor: explaining what is happening in the economy and markets, and why it matters,’ she wrote in a final post on her BBC blog. Change: Miss Flanders said she was leaving the Corporation because it was the right time for a new challenge . ‘What will be different, in my new role, is that I will have more time and resources to develop my own ideas - and get a deeper understanding of the markets, inside one of the most experienced financial institutions in the world. ‘I will even (shock) be permitted to have an opinion - my own view. At least, if I can remember how, after 11 years of trying to avoid them. ‘The other thrill, for me, will be helping to grow a business. That is something I’ve never done, despite spending most of my working life as an economist, talking about the market economy. After 11 years at the BBC, this feels like the right time to give it a try.’ BBC business reporter Joe Lynam last night suggested that Miss Flanders’ move was a lucrative one. Pay rise: Experts have suggested Miss Flanders's role of chief market strategist at the Wall Street banking giant JP Morgan (whose offices in New York City are pictured) could be worth more than £400,000-a-year . He used his Twitter account to post the message: ‘My amazing colleague @BBCStephanie is to leave the BBC with almost immediate effect and join JP Morgan Asset Mgt. No money in journalism.’ 'I will even (shock) be permitted to have an opinion - my own view. At least, if I can remember how, after 11 years of trying to avoid them' Stephanie Flanders . It was shortly after taking up the role of economics editor in 2008 that she began a five-month period of maternity leave. It meant she was off work when the story of the credit crunch broke. It was also in that year that she famously clashed with David Cameron when quizzing the prime minister over the Tory’s tax-breaks policy, asking if unmarried and well-off mothers like her would be persuaded to marry if they were offered extra money. James Harding, the BBC’s director of news and current affairs, said Flanders had ‘given our audience unrivalled coverage of the economy – the most important story in Britain over the past few years. High praise: Robert Peston, BBC business editor, said Miss Flanders has been 'the outstanding economics broadcaster of the last few years' ‘She has done it with intelligence, understanding and good judgement.  For the past 11 years she has been an exceptional journalist and broadcaster and she’ll be sorely missed. We all wish her every success in the future.’ 'Stephanie has been the outstanding economics broadcaster of the last few years' Robert Peston, BBC business editor . Robert Peston, BBC business editor, added: ‘Stephanie has been the outstanding economics broadcaster of the last few years. ‘She has made an enormous contribution to the BBC, because of the authority and clarity of her journalism. We all wish her well in her new and challenging role, but I will feel the loss of an always stimulating and supportive colleague.’ JP Morgan would not reveal how much Miss Flanders will be paid in her new role, but the bank’s CEO and head of Global Funds Management, George Gatch, said: ‘Our fiduciary mindset as an asset manager is to help clients navigate the complexities of investing as they plan for retirement, save for education costs and sidestep the pitfalls inherent in volatile markets. ‘Stephanie’s experience and objective approach uniquely qualify her for doing this.’","Flanders, 45, set for lucrative switch after working at BBC for 11 years .

Cecil Parkinson’s love child may have cost him a chance to try for the Tory leadership, newly released files from the Margaret Thatcher archives have revealed. The documents, which include his resignation letter, record the downfall of the man who the Prime Minister was widely thought to have considered her heir. They reveal that Mrs Thatcher was secretly planning to appoint Mr Parkinson as Foreign Secretary, a move that would have kickstarted his rise to the top. Instead, he informed her on the day of the 1983 election that he was having an affair with his former secretary, Sara Keays, and that she had become pregnant with his child. Notes on a scandal: Cecil Parkinson and Margaret Thatcher during the Conservative Party Conference in 1981. Thatcher may have been considering him as her successor before his admission of a love child derailed his political career . Heart-felt: Cecil Parkinson's previously-unpublished resignation note and Mrs Thatcher's reply . The 30-year-old files have been released from the archives at Churchill College, Cambridge. They reveal the chaos that ruined Mrs Thatcher’s reshuffle plans. Her notes from the time show that she intended to make Mr Parkinson Foreign Secretary, though her staff’s reshuffle documents suggest that they did not know about the idea. Chris Collins from the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, the only historian to have studied the files, said she had essentially anointed him as her successor. He said: ‘It’s only speculative that she considered him to be her successor but it would appear that she was very serious about him indeed. Cecil Parkinson with his wife Ann. He had been having an affair with his secretary for 12 years . Scandal: Sara Keays, former secretary and mistress of Cecil Parkinson. News of their affair and her pregnancy forced Parkinson to resign in October 1983 . ‘He had risen very fast and she knew that by promoting him in this way, she would create an atmosphere around him.’ The former party chairman told Mrs Thatcher about his 12-year affair on June 9, 1983, the day of the election. How Diana stole the limelight . He wrote to her: ‘It seems strange that after over eight years on the front bench as part of your team, I am now to be a spectator of events rather than a participant in them.’ Mrs Thatcher later received a letter from Miss Keays’s father Colonel Keays, but she is believed to have burned the note in a fireplace at Chequers. As a result of the news, she decided to delay the reshuffle by a day – and made Mr Parkinson secretary for trade and industry instead. At the time, she wrote to Judge Alan King-Hamilton saying: ‘It has been a most difficult week – and such a sad ending for everyone. ‘These days it is not permitted to suffer one’s wounds in private. There has been no peace for Cecil and Ann [his wife].’ Mr Parkinson was forced to resign a few months later on October 14 after Miss Keays decided to publish a statement to ‘put the record straight’ regarding the nature of their relationship. She wrote: ‘My baby was conceived in a long-standing, loving relationship which I allowed to continue because I believed in our eventual marriage.’ Flora Keays was born on New Year’s Eve 1983, although an injunction prevented her identity from being known or publicly reported until she turned 18. She was diagnosed with learning disabilities and Asperger syndrome – and needed surgery to remove a brain tumour when she was four. Mr Parkinson’s resignation letter and Mrs Thatcher’s reply were never published, possibly because they could have prolonged the embarrassing scandal. However along with other documents they have now been made available to the public, and can be accessed online at www.margaret thatcher.org. The files reveal that she replied to Mr Parkinson’s letter saying: ‘I am saddened beyond words both by the loss of your contribution as a member of the Government and by the tragic circumstances in which that loss has come about.’ But Mrs Thatcher also made it clear that she expected him to remain with his wife. Journalists at the time were suspicious that it had been Mrs Thatcher who prevented the couple from splitting up. Mr Parkinson remained in his marriage – and returned to the government in 1987. * Treasury  staff hid silver cutlery from Margaret Thatcher to stop her taking it for the Cabinet table, the files reveal. Douglas Wass, who was the first permanent secretary of the Treasury, told the Prime Minister in his leaving speech: ‘The Treasury has a splendid collection of Georgian silver. ‘When you heard this, your ears pricked up. I gave instructions that during your visit it was to be kept out of sight. ‘I now know what the monks must have felt when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries!’ Letter: John Nott praised the former PM's looks . John Nott wrote a letter paying tribute to Margaret Thatcher and her ‘good looks’ when he resigned as defence secretary. He wrote: ‘It is inexcusable to say so nowadays, but I actually admire you as a woman – your good looks, charm and bearing have always attracted me, as a man. 'I’m sorry, but what is wrong with that! ‘I think your emotional, instinctive and unpragmatic approach to most issues – so very unmasculine – is the secret of your success in the male-dominated world of politics.’ Mr Nott did not receive a reply and although Mrs Thatcher marked, underlined and scrawled on almost every document she ever read, his letter was left blank. He left the government in 1983 and was replaced by Michael Heseltine after being criticised over the 1981 defence white paper. In his letter he wrote: ‘Your greatest triumph as a PM, if I may say so, is that your colleagues actually like you. Some of them even love you, just a little!’ He signed off the rather personal letter with: ‘Love – John.’ Margaret Thatcher may have been aware that Alan Clark was having an affair when she appointed him as a minister. In a previously secret note to Mrs Thatcher, her principal private secretary Ian Gow urged her not to allow his dalliance with ‘this absurd girl’ to prevent the appointment. The note does not spell  out who the girl is, but Mr Clark’s many affairs have been documented by  his biographer, who has had access to his personal papers. Mrs Thatcher did not reply to the note, but Mr Clark received his first ministerial posting as a parliamentary under-secretary at the Department of Employment in 1983. The serial womaniser  once described Mrs Thatcher as ‘very attractive,’ praising her ‘eyes, wrists and ankles’.","Letters show the former PM wanted Parkinson to be her heir before scandal .

A man was left needing hospital treatment after police punched and kneed him, struck him with batons – and set a police dog on him that bit his neck and head. David Connor Castellani, 20, was charged with aggravated assault after the incident, but is suing Atlantic City police for using excessive force. The incident occurred on an Atlantic City street in the early hours of June 5 this year. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. WARNING: GRAPHIC . Violent: One police officer was filmed repeatedly striking Mr Castellani with a baton as his colleagues wrestle with him . Exchanging words: Mr Castellani remonstrated with police shortly before they arrested him in number . Mr Castellani had been ejected from a casino for being under-age and the footage, taken by the casino’s CCTV system, begins with him remonstrating with police officers. A short while later three officers run up to Mr Castellani just after he shrugs his shoulders, and wrestle him to the ground. Mr Castellani does not appear to resist arrest, but can be seen clinging on to one of the officers. Two more officers quickly join in, with one repeatedly punching Mr Castellani in the back. One of the policeman can also be seen hitting Mr Castellani on the back and on the legs with his baton as he lays face down on the road. Seconds later a police dog handler arrives, identified by NBC investigative reporters as Sterling Wheaten. The policemen restraining Mr Castellani step aside and Officer Wheaten’s dog is shown being allowed to bite him repeatedly on the neck and head. Arrest: Four officers are seen here forcing Mr Castellani to the ground . Bitten: A police dog is then unleashed on Mr Castellani, leaving him with serious head and neck wounds . Mr Castellani was charged with aggravated assault, with the police claiming that he punched an officer and choked the police dog. Mr Castellani’s father, an attorney who has represented police officers in the past, told NBC: ‘It absolutely horrified me. It’s been a nightmare for us. I’ve never seen anything like this in my life.’ Speaking about the moment the dog unit arrived, he said: ‘Without any assessment of the situation, he releases the dog on to my son’s neck.’ Castellani suffered serious wounds to his head and neck as a result of the dog’s bites, with doctors revealing that he may never be the same, according to NBC. Doctors revealed that he could have been killed by the dog, the father said. Ernest Jubilee, Atlantic City Police Chief, told NBC: ‘I saw the tape and I saw no reason to suspend or remove the officers from their regular duties.’ The incident is, however, being investigated by the Atlantic City Police internal affairs unit. NBC discovered that Officer Wheaten had been investigated 15 times over allegations of misconduct, including 12 claims of excessive force or assault. None of the complaints were upheld.","David Castellani, 20, was left with serious head and neck wounds .

Boris Johnson backed a ban on veils in the classroom yesterday after he was confronted by a Muslim woman who wears the burqa on a radio phone in. The London Mayor said schools should have the right to force pupils to show their faces to teachers. He told London radio station LBC: ‘Normally I’m in favour of liberty and people wearing whatever they want. Where I do draw the line though, I think that the face veil is a very difficult thing to make work in a school. ‘I think that you’ve got to teach in a way that you can see how the kids are responding. They’ve got to be able to participate in the class. I think that it’s only fair that they should be able to react and take part in that way. ‘I don’t think that it can reasonably be called a standard piece of uniform to get little girls to cover their faces.’ Mr Johnson was quizzed by a woman identified only as Milam from South Norwood in South London, who said that her 15 year old daughter has voluntarily worn a full face veil since she was 12. She said: ‘I myself wear the burqa. ‘My daughter is 15. From the age of 12 or maybe 13, she decided for herself, her own free will that she would like to do it. 'As parents Boris, we are expected in society to teach our children to respect one another, to respect schools and so on. On the other hand Boris, you are asking us to go against school policies or school rules if it involves wearing the face veils.’ But Mr Johnson said: ‘I’m afraid that is my view I think in places of instruction where you’re asking kids to participate in a class, to have fun together when the teacher has got to see how the lesson is going down. ‘I’ve been a teacher, very ingloriously in the past. It is a terribly difficult job and you’ve got to know what, how your pupils are responding.

Radical: Julianne Marriott, the Campaign Director of Don't Judge My Family, has links to the radical wing of the Labour party . During BBC coverage of David Cameron’s marriage tax break, a little-known campaign group was given an extraordinary – and largely unchallenged – platform to voice its opposition. Listeners to Saturday’s news programmes on BBC Radio 4 and 5 Live could have been forgiven for thinking the pressure group Don’t Judge My Family was politically independent. The 10am Radio 4 bulletin, in which the group was the only quoted organisation, was typical. Newsreader: ‘Announcing the move David Cameron said he wanted to recognise the commitment and responsibility of married couples. But Julianne Marriott from campaign group Don’t Judge My Family explained why her organisation was opposed to the measure.’ She said: ‘It’s not going to help families who need it the most – single parents, widows, widowers, cohabiting couples and couples who both work... It’s out of touch and out of date. The Tories should be trying to help families and not judge them.’ No mention was made of any political affiliations, but a cursory look at the group’s directors reveals deep ties to the Labour Party – so much so that a Conservative MP questioned if the group was merely a Labour ‘front’. Miss Marriott, its campaign director, is a professional Left-wing campaigner and a Labour Party member with links to the radical wing of the party. Part of the Labour Uncut blogging team, she is also involved with Pragmatic Radicalism, the self-proclaimed ‘New Forum for Labour Ideas’ and reportedly handles Government relations for the Press regulation lobby group Hacked Off. Another director, Josie Cluer, describes herself as a ‘public sector reformer with fingers in many pies’, including the Labour Women’s Network which exists to get more Labour women elected to public office. And according to Labour MP Chuka Umunna, the campaign was launched by Matthew McGregor, the man hailed as Barack Obama’s ‘digital attack dog’ in last year’s US presidential election – who has just been recruited for Labour’s 2015 General Election campaign. The trio are inextricably linked to the Labour Party, yet there was no mention of any political affiliation when Miss Marriott was given a platform to speak on the BBC at the weekend. Group: Labour MP Chuka Umunna, pictured speaking at last week's party conference, said the group was set up by Matthew McGregor, Barack Obama's 'digital attack dog' in last year's US Presidential Election .

It has urged supporters to sign its online petition against the allowance, although by last night it had attracted fewer than 5,000 signatures. Conservative MP Greg Hands said the group was a front for Labour to attack the policy. He said: ‘What is it about the family that these people can’t stand? Setting up front groups like to criticise our policies is nasty politics all over again.’ The BBC did not respond to requests for comment.","Don't Judge My Family was the only quoted organisation in stories .

Judges at one of Britain’s largest courts were forced to apologise for adjourning trials because teenage gang members were touring the cells below. The sentencing of several criminals had to be aborted amid farcical scenes at Southwark Crown Court this week when young offenders were invited to take a look at the custody suites. The tour was part of a community scheme to deter ‘high-risk’ teenagers involved in, or at the risk of, gang crime, from further offending. Farce: Courts were forced to rise at 4pm at Southwark Crown Court this week when young offenders were invited to take a look at the custody suites . But there was outrage that courtrooms were disrupted and sentencing of serious offenders halted at a cost to the taxpayer of tens of thousands of pounds just to show a group of teenage thugs around. Custody cases at the court were postponed on Monday after a dozen teenagers from the Lambeth area of South London were invited. The visit, which happened during normal court hours, meant there would be nowhere to put the defendants if they were jailed. But only two youngsters turned up for the anti-gang initiative planned by Lambeth Council and the police. Southwark Crown Court, which is the fourth-largest crown court in Britain with 15 courtrooms, costs a minimum of £42,000 a day per defendant to run. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said yesterday: ‘Taxpayers will be appalled that this court visit for gang members interfered with the dispensing of justice, causing considerable disruption and incurring additional costs. The young gang members were given a tour of the cells, which forced the courts to abort sentencings and hearings (file photo) ‘Regardless of the merits of the visit, Lambeth Council should have organised it for a time when the court was not sitting so that important hearings were not interrupted.’ At least two cases were adjourned. In one case, there was uproar when the judge announced he would have to adjourn midway through the hearing. Judge Michael Grieve had risen to consider the fate of two fraudsters in a £4.5million scam when suddenly he announced that the defendants and their relatives would have to come back the following day. Daniel Snelling, 38, and his cousin Rebecca McDonald, 42, were facing years behind bars for persuading scores of vulnerable victims to hand over their life savings in a £4.5million wine investment scam. But having already heard mitigation, Judge Grieve said he could not continue. McDonald sobbed and Snelling appeared shocked while angry family and friends in the packed court room bellowed ‘you must be joking’. Judge Grieve said: ‘Because of an event that is taking place involving the cells in this building, all courts have been asked to rise at 4pm. ‘I have to express real regret this has occurred.’ Snelling was jailed for seven and a half years the next day, while McDonald, a former employee of accountancy giant KPMG, was locked up for three years. The sentencing of a woman police officer for exchanging more than 1,000 calls and texts with her jailed lover, Dominic Diop, was also adjourned. Diop shouted: ‘F*** that, man. I’m not coming back tomorrow. They can do it by video link – I’m not coming back, bruv.’ The hearing resumed the next day when Diop, currently serving an extended sentence for armed robbery, was given five months in prison, while his WPC lover Kayley Newman received a suspended prison sentence. A spokesman for Lambeth Council said the event had been planned in advance to ensure minimal disruption. The council hailed the initiative as a success, saying several ‘high-risk individuals’ had taken the first steps to changing their lifestyle.","Southwark Crown Court brought to a halt by gang visits .

As HR Director ‘Lipgloss’ Lucy Adams was labelled a liar by a Parliamentary committee, it was not only sections of the BBC newsroom that cheered in agreement. For watching a recording of the mauling was Steve Vear, her third husband. Speaking for the first time about their marriage, Mr Vear claims he fell ‘completely and madly in love’ with the £320,000-a-year executive before being ‘written out of her life’. 'Lipgloss' Lucy Adams on her honeymoon in the Maldives after marrying third husband, Steve Vear . Head of sales in the UK for a multinational optical firm, Mr Vear, who earns a six-figure salary, met Ms Adams in September 2008 and they were instantly attracted to each other after their first date at a dancing class. ‘She did salsa but I wanted to learn how to do ballroom dancing and she jumped straight in,’ the 51-year-old recalled. ‘I could tell there was something between us and I was attracted to her. ‘I went to meet her at her house in Fulham two nights after and never really left.’ Mr Vear said it soon became clear that Ms Adams, who has a daughter from a previous marriage, had expensive tastes, as proved when the pair got engaged. ‘It was Valentine’s Day on the beach in Marbella. I remember being very nervous and I picked a ring, which cost £200, the same day. ‘The first thing she did when she got back was go to Hatton Garden and buy a new ring. I never saw the receipt but I reckon it must have cost between £15,000 and £20,000. The wedding of Lucy Adams and Steve Vear in 2009 which cost £20,000 according to Mr Vear . She just said she’d always wanted a ring with massive diamonds and would I mind? I wasn’t really thinking that straight because I was so in love with her. I didn’t question it, I just thought if that’s what she wants to do let her get on with it. She had it cut the same way as the ring I gave her, but obviously you don’t get much of a diamond for £200.’ Mr Vear, who has been married three times and has two children from his first marriage, added Ms Adams certainly lived up to her ‘Lipgloss’ nickname and the couple had a ‘fairytale wedding’ when they tied the knot in December 2009 in Putney, South-West London. ‘Lucy wanted a winter wedding with candles everywhere. It cost about £20,000. Then we had a really expensive ten-day honeymoon in the Maldives and the villa cost about £1,200 a night,’ he said. ‘I’d never heard of the expression Lipgloss Lucy but it’s not one I’d disagree with. She’d never go anywhere without make-up. I bought her a £150 tub of face cream once as a present from Harrods and she just kept on buying it. ‘And she had an entire bedroom at her home turned into a dressing room where she kept all her designer handbags and shoes. Most of her bags came from Harrods and Selfridges. She must have had around 25, costing £1,000 upwards.’ Ms Adams, who was overseeing a major overhaul at the BBC, could have been excused for losing sleep. But Mr Vear confessed it was more mundane marriage problems that kept her awake at night. ‘She oversaw massive changes to the BBC pension system as well as pay freezes and job cuts. But none of that really fazed her. What seemed to upset her more was my snoring,’ he said. The end of their brief marriage still haunts Steve after he found out about her affair with PR director Andrew Powell. And he says since their split in the summer of 2011 they have had just one conversation and exchanged a handful of texts. ‘About three weeks before I found out, I was sitting in a Chinese restaurant in London with her and said, “Is there anything I should know about? Something doesn’t seem right.” And she said, “Absolutely not”. ‘But it was only when I was in Spain that I actually discovered her lover’s underpants. I was going through the dirty washing and his white boxer shorts were in the laundry basket. I also found a boarding ticket with both their names on and I looked him up on the internet. Mr Vear says he was 'written out' of his ex-wife's life after discovering she was having an affair with PR director Andrew Powell . ‘I left them on her side of the bed. She didn’t say a word and I thought, “If you have had an affair I’m not going to beg you to stay so get on with it.” A few days later she finally said, “You left them there and you didn’t say anything. If you want a conversation, have a conversation.” ‘It felt like she was just rubbing my nose in it. We loved that place – it was in the hills overlooking Marbella. I found it but we both picked it together. And she took him there. ‘The very same day Lucy told me I went to see a solicitor and said I wanted a divorce. I only found out later she’s still with the same guy.

Relatives of a Sandy Hook shooting victim have spoken out for the first time about opposing gun control saying they feel lumped together with other families from the tragedy in favor of new laws. Though Rachel D'Avino, a teacher at the Newtown elementary school, was shot to death by a crazed gunman, her family still owns firearms - including an assault-style rifle - and is against any measures to control their purchase, according to her sister Hannah. For the first time the D'Avinos said they wanted to outline their point of view - feeling that in the past they were simply presumed to have the same stance as other families in the massacre. A divergent opinion: Peter Paradis, left, and stepdaughter Hannah D'Avino are against tought gun control laws despite their beloved Hannah being shot to death . 'We're very frustrated mainly because the 26 families got lumped together. We're 26 families made of individuals that all have different opinions,' Hannah D'Avino told the Republican-American. 'It's like people are speaking for me and speaking for my sister,' she added, 'they don't know her and they don't know us.' The family then recalled to the paper Thanksgiving 2009 when they took turns firing rounds into a tree on their five acres of land with an AR-15 - the same type of semi-automatic firearm used to kill their beloved Rachel, 20 first-grade students and five other school staffers. The family takes pride in their marksmanship and record of gun safety, Hannah D'Avino told the paper, adding that Rachel was a good shot herself. Despite a constant presence of guns in the family's lives, the only gun-related incident they have ever had was Rachel's shooting death, her angry sister noted. Honored, but not in agreement: Rachel D'Avino's mother Mary (middle), and sister Sarah (left) were honored to meet President Obama, but they disagree with him on gun control . The family is angered by politicians attaching the name of a shooting enthusiast from a family of gun ownership advocates to a bill that, if passed, would restrict gun ownership rights. They declined a ride . aboard Air Force One with the president to lobby for gun control, they . also declined to meet with Vice President Joe Biden when he lobbied in . the state for tougher restrictions on gun ownership . Rachel D'Avino would often target shoot in her backyard, her sister says, arguing that attaching her name to gun control legislation is disingenuous. Hannah D'Avino told the paper members of her family were taught to use firearms at a very young age - being given firearm safety lectures before they were old enough to even clean a gun. Peter Paradis, Rachel D'Avino's stepfather, has been around firearms his whole life, he told the paper. From pellet guns, to pistols, to assault-style rifles, he knows firearms. Mr Paradis also staunchly opposes the gun control laws passed in Connecticut in the wake of the Newtown shooting, he told the paper. He also opposes proposed federal gun control laws, instead favoring improved enforcement of laws already passed. Loss: Rachel's boyfriend was going to propose to her on Christmas Eve with her grandmother's ring . Saying goodbye: She was buried with the ring after her funeral in Bethlehem, Connecticut last week . Neither Democrat, nor Republican, Mr . Paradis says he was honored to meet President Obama - but dislikes how . the president has 'used the shooting to further his political agenda'. 'I . have to say meeting the president was an honor. He's a very . compassionate man, very genuine,' said Mr Paradis. 'What I don't . appreciate is the politics. He used (the shooting) for his agenda. Our . governor did the same thing. That's totally wrong.' He also pointed out that media portrayals of Mr Lanza . charging into the school with an assault rife were inaccurate, and only . fed into the anti-gun political machine. 'The . shooter in Newtown didn't use an assault rifle, he used an . assault-style rifle,' Mr Paradis told the paper. 'It's much different. He could have used a much larger caliber, the same semi-automatic stuff . and he could have done a lot more damage.' Not forgotten: Snow blankets the ground as red stockings paying tribute to victims of the Sandy Hook shooting line the fence surrounding the Sandy Hook Cemetery in Newtown . Day of sadness: A sign sits at a snow-covered memorial for the Sandy Hook victims on Christmas Day . The dead woman's step-father also argued that treating mental illness would be more effective than controlling guns and tried to make this argument with other Sandy Hook victim families. He said they were shut out of future Sandy Hook Promise meetings as a result. 'It's not the gun that killed the kids,' Mr Paradis told the paper, 'it's the mental illness... it's a lot easier to take and ram through gun control because it doesn't cost anything to ban it.'","Hannah D'Avino sister of killed teacher Rachel D'Avino has broken her silence on gun control .

A student at a private all girls' college has caused outrage and prompted attorneys to investigate after trying to set up an 'exclusive' straight-only sorority. Drawing the most vitriol from Twitter users was her comment that she wanted to set up the club because 'I feel marginalized and I feel like the minority'. In an email leaked onto the internet by a fellow undergraduate, the unnamed student says: 'I want to start a sorority at Smith (Delta Gamma/DG), which would basically just be an exclusive group for straight girls, a little friend group...' She goes on to suggest that activities would include 'mixers with Amherst men, weekly dinner dates, weekly photoshoots (sic) where we would dress up nice, baking nights...' The email message was removed after it caused fury among internet users . However, plans for the first mixer, already organised with the Amherst basketball team according to the post, may have to be cancelled after the proposal sparked outrage. Officials at Delta Gamma, one of the first women's fraternities, have put their attorney in contact with the $43,000-a-year school to investigate. The fraternity, whose stated values are to 'promote educational and cultural interests, create a true sense of social responsibility, and develop the finest qualities of character', say they were not aware of the plans and will not sanction them. Mary Ellen Hardies, the national chapter's director of communication, told USA Today: 'Our attorney has been in contact . with the university trying to figure out what the heck is going on, who . this girl is, to what extent things are happening' She added: 'That sort of approach does not fall in . line with our values at all.' Twitter users also vented their frustrations, with one commenting: 'As a straight smithie I have NEVER felt marginalized by the queer community.' 'I can't fathom how you see it as a source of oppression. Being straight isn't a burden, not at smith, anywhere.' Delta Gamma fraternity have said their attorney is now in contact with the college to find out what has been going on . The outcry was so vehement that the pupil who leaked the message took it down and apologised for the 'witch hunt' against the girl. Smith College's Student Body President Augusta Gronquist said: 'Incidents of this type go against our understanding of what it means to be a community.' 'People in our community are hurting right now; many issues, a lot of which are unspoken or frequently ignored, have been raised and need our attention.' Smith College was established in 1871 after Sophia Smith left a large inheritance as funding for a women's college to provide an education equal to that of men. The U.S. News & World Report ranked Smith at 18th in 2013 among the best liberal arts colleges. 'Hello, this is [a person] and I am sending this message to girls I think might be interested in this idea and I would also love to hear your opinion on this. 'so I have this crazy idea but tell me what you honestly think.

Cigarette packets that feature health warnings deter a third of British teenagers from smoking, a survey has revealed. The . British Heart Foundation’s poll of 2,500 13 to 18-year-olds showed that current packaging on cigarette packets stops 33 per cent of teens from taking up the habit. The survey also revealed that nearly 8 in 10 young people, or 77 per cent, think the UK should introduce standardised cigarette packs - like those used in Australia. Deterrent: Health warnings on cigarette packets stop a third of teens from smoking, a new poll has revealed . Australia became the first country in the world to adopt standardised . cigarette packs - which are almost entirely covered in graphic warnings - last year. Half of teens in the country said that cigarette packaging stopped them from smoking, the global survey revealed. Two thirds, or 66 per cent, of Australian teens think the packs should be introduced elsewhere in the world. About 10 per cent of teenagers in the UK assume that certain cigarette brands are healthier than others, the survey also found. The results come just 24 hours before the European Parliament is set to vote on key legislation that would see cigarette packs across the EU feature larger graphic health warnings on both sides of the box.

'Australia has led the way on standardised packs, the Scottish Government has committed, and now the rest of the UK must act to protect future generations from a deadly habit.'

Labour will build 200,000 homes a year by 2020, Ed Miliband will pledge today as he sets out plans for a new generation of garden cities and new towns. The Labour leader will tell his party's annual conference in Brighton that a shortage of housing is central to Britain's 'cost of living crisis', leaving millions of working people unable to afford the houses they want. And he will also promise to cancel a planned Coalition cut in corporation tax for 80,000 big companies to fund lower business rates for small firms. Touching moment: Labour leader Ed Miliband and his wife Justine in their hotel room in Brighton, as he gets ready to give his  keynote speech to his party's annual conference this afternoon . Hugs: Justine smiles as goes to hug her husband on the balcony of their hotel room in Brighton . The Labour leader will today attempt . to steal the Tory mantle as the party of ‘vibrant, dynamic’ small . enterprise, which he says will drive the recovery. He . will echo Ronald Reagan’s 1980 attack on Jimmy Carter, saying voters . should ask themselves at the 2015 election: ‘Am I better off than I was . five years ago?’ Yesterday, . he staged a one-man walkout as union boss Len McCluskey warned Labour . had ‘no future’ unless it bowed to the unions’ demands. He stalked off the conference stage as the Unite leader rose to declare Labour was now ‘our party’. Mr . McCluskey, who received a standing ovation, quipped at the Labour . leader’s departing back: ‘I am sorry that Ed has left the platform but, . anyway, thank you.’ Labour will cancel a planned Coalition cut in corporation tax for 80,000 big companies to fund lower business rates for small firms, Ed Miliband claims . Dressed up: Speaker's wife Sally Bercow arrives at the Labour Party Conference today in a striking blue dress . But despite the public spat, he later told a fringe meeting that unions were getting a ‘warmer reception’ from Mr Miliband than they had from New Labour. Mr Miliband will use his conference speech today to outline proposals to loosen the planning system to allow dozens of new towns to be built, expand state-funded childcare and crack down on rip-off energy firms. However, it is his decision to hit bigger companies that employ millions of people to fund a tax break for small firms that will prove most controversial – and almost certainly infuriate business groups. He will pledge to reverse a planned cut in corporation tax from 21p to 20p if he wins power in 2015. That will cost the 80,000 largest firms £340million in the first year and £785million in the next. Yesterday, he staged a one-man walkout as union boss Len McCluskey warned Labour had 'no future' unless it bowed to the unions' demands . Labour would use the money to cut business rates on properties with an annual rental value of £50,000 or less, so that in 2015 they return to the level of 2014. Labour would then freeze the rates until 2016. The move would benefit the owners of 1.5million shops, pubs and other small businesses by an average of nearly £450 over two years. Mr Miliband will say the move demonstrates Labour’s commitment to creating a ‘One Nation economy’ and to becoming ‘the party of small business’. He will say that while the economy appears to have turned a corner, living standards are still getting worse. Many new jobs are ‘too low paid’, he will say, while gains in the economy are ‘scooped up by a privileged few’. Mr Miliband, who this week declared he was bringing socialism back, will wage class warfare, telling activists: ‘They used to say, “A rising tide lifts all boats”. Now the rising tide seems to lift the yachts. ‘At the general election in 2015, you should ask yourself, “Am I better off now than I was five years ago?” You’ve made the sacrifices. But you’ve not got the rewards. ‘Will the pain be worth it for the gain under this government? No.’ He will insist that the Prime Minister’s talk of Britain being in a ‘global race’ means a ‘race to the bottom’ with ‘the lowest wages, the worst terms and conditions and the fewest rights at work’. Mr Miliband will set out plans for a Rebuilding Britain Commission, led by former BBC Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons, which will work with councils to identify sites for new towns. It will prepare a legislative framework for Labour to start building immediately if it wins the 2015 general election. Mr Miliband will accuse David Cameron of presiding over the lowest level of home-building of any prime minister since the 1920s, resulting in a situation where fewer than half of the homes needed to keep up with demand are being built. With just 87,000 homes built this year, Britain is facing the biggest housing crisis in a generation, he will say. An average family needs 22 years to save for a typical deposit on a home, compared with three years in 1997, Mr Miliband will say. By the end of the next Parliament in 2020, numbers of houses built should be increased to at least 200,000 a year, he will tell activists in his keynote conference speech. The Lyons Commission will be told to develop a detailed plan so that Labour can hit the ground running on entering office - including the drafting of new legislation and detailed plans for new towns in specific locations. Any attack on a member of the armed forces will be a specific criminal offence with a tougher penalty, under Labour plans announced yesterday. Jim Murphy, the party’s defence spokesman, outlined a new Armed Forces Covenant to give the forces priority for health services and housing, support with finding a job, and protection from discrimination. He said Labour will table amendments to the Defence Reform Bill in the coming weeks to bring in a specific criminal offence for attacking forces personnel ‘ensuring they are treated with the dignity their bravery deserves’. Mr Murphy told the Labour party conference in Brighton: ‘It’s sad that those who fight for our country might need the protection of our laws, but some do.’ He said the Government had neglected soldiers’ housing, and scrapped specialists and equipment, jeopardising safety on the front line. In a jibe at International Development Secretary Justine Greening he said: ‘This is a government that during the crucial Syria vote two of their own ministers locked themselves away in a soundproof room. It’s little wonder this government won’t listen.’ Miss Greening and Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds claimed they missed the vote because they were chatting in a soundproofed room. Mr Murphy said despite the Labour vote against the principle of military intervention in Syria they had to remain ‘prepared to intervene’ in other cases.","Will try to steal Tory mantle as party of 'vibrant, dynamic' small enterprise .

The mother of Baby P will be given detailed advice on how to hide her identity when she leaves jail in the coming days to avoid being tracked down and attacked by vigilantes. Tracey Connelly, who allowed her son Peter to be tortured to death by her boyfriend, will be told to change her name and appearance after she was refused a new identity funded by the taxpayer. The 32-year-old is expected to be freed by a parole board this week and will leave Low Newton jail near Durham for a . parole hostel 'within days' where she will start her reintegration back into society. Freedom: Tracey Connelly, 32, left, is set to walk free from prison this . week without a new identity and will be advised how to hide. She was jailed in 2009 . over the death of her son Baby P, Peter Connelly, right . She is already said to look markedly different from her notorious mugshot, having ballooned to 22st while in prison. But probation officers will also advise her to change her name by deed poll, change to colour of her hair and have it cut differently. After just five years in jail experts believe she poses ‘no danger to the public’, despite committing a crime that horrified Britain. 'She will be subject to intense supervision and monitoring once she is freed and that will go on for years to come,' criminal justice expert Harry Fletcher told the Mirror. There is a danger that she is at risk from vigilantes, so steps will be taken to prevent that. She will receive advice and coaching on not giving away her identity, and that could take several weeks. ‘Steps will be taken to keep her safe including moving her to a new area, a change of appearance and name.’ Set to leave: Connelly - who is at Low Newton jail (pictured) in Brasside, County Durham - has applied to the Parole Board to have her case reviewed, who are expected to let her go after five years in prison . Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing . nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend . Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen. Peter was just . 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his . mother’s flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 separate . injuries, including a broken back. The case provoked a national . scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and doctors missed a . series of warning signs that could have saved the child’s life. Sickened . by the depravity, 132,000 people joined ‘hate groups’ on social . networking internet sites calling for Connelly, Barker and Owen to ‘burn . in hell’. Some threatened to violently attack them when they are eventually released. Despite widespread horror at her imminent release, ministers have . decided she should not be granted lifetime anonymity and round-the-clock . police protection. Indefinite sentences: Tracey Connelly's . boyfriend Steven Barker (left) and his paedophile brother Jason Owen . (right) were both convicted of causing or allowing Peter's death . Anonymity orders are rare and only four are currently in force. These . apply to child killer Mary Bell, James Bulger’s murderers Robert .

So instead she will have to use her own initiative to avoid detection, and  has already told friends she wants a new boyfriend when she is released. But even her own mother believes she should never leave prison. Mary O’Connor said: 'She should never come out. But even if she does, I won’t be seeing her again – she’s out of my life.

Captured: Delta Force commandoes pulled al-Qaeda terrorist Abu Anas al-Libi off the streets of Tripoli after a 15-year manhunt . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has defended the capture of a terrorism suspect by American forces in Libya, saying complaints about the operation from Libya and others are unfounded. The family of al-Qaeda terrorist Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Rugai, also known as Abu Anas al-Libi, who was captured by American Delta Force commandos has described the moment that he was snatched off the streets of Tripoli, Libya as a 'kidnapping'. Kerry said the weekend seizure in Tripoli of the suspected al-Qaida operative Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai complied with U.S. law. The suspect's son Abdullah al-Ruqaie described the capture to the UK's Daily Telegraph. 'He was coming back from the mosque, at 6:38 in the morning,' he said. 'Four vehicles stopped by his car, in front of the house, and ten masked and unmasked men came out, broke the car window on the steering wheel side, drugged him, and took him. 'He was kidnapped in front of the house not inside. If he had been kidnapped inside the house we would not have let them take him without a fight,' he said. Kerry, speaking from Bali where he is attending an Asia-Pacific economic conference, said the suspect was a 'legal and appropriate target' for the U.S. military and will face justice in a court of law. He added it was . important not to 'sympathize' with wanted terrorists. 'I hope the perception is in the world that people who commit acts of terror and who have been appropriately indicted by courts of law, by the legal process, will know that United States of America is going to do anything in its power that is legal and appropriate in order to enforce the law and to protect our security,' Kerry told reporters after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

'I think it's important for people in . the world not to sympathize with alleged terrorists but to underscore . the importance of the rule of law,' he added, when asked about the . Libyan government's complaint that the seizure amounted to kidnapping. Libya has asked Washington to explain and clarify its actions. Al-Ruqai was seized on the streets of the . Libyan capital on Saturday. He is accused by the U.S. of involvement in . the 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and . Nairobi, Kenya, which killed more than 220 people. He . has been on the FBI's most wanted terrorists list since it was . introduced shortly after the September 11, 2001 attack, with a $5 million . bounty on his head. He was . indicted by federal prosecutors in 2000 and has evaded capture for 15 . years. War on terror: Kerry, seen here with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, said that the United States will pursue terrorists to the utmost of its ability . Kerry, a former prosecutor, noted that al-Libi has been indicted by a U.S. court and will have a chance to defend himself. 'An indictment is an accusation,' Kerry said. 'In . our legal system the defendant is presumed innocent until proven . guilty, but he will now have an opportunity to defend himself and to be . appropriately brought to justice in a court of law.' Al-Rugai was . quickly flown out of Libya and is likely to be extradited to New York to . stand trial for helping to plan the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing in . Nairobi, Kenya. His capture, . during one of two nearly simultaneous raids in Africa Saturday, is being . heralded as a major victory for American counter-terrorism forces. Al-Libi's brother, Nabih, called the raid 'an act of piracy.' American officials said they told the . Libyan government about the raid in Tripoli, but Prime Minister Ali . Zeidan has said he was never informed about the operation. He issued a statement demanding an explanation of the raid. He called the capture of al-Libi a 'kidnapping' and said he should have been tried in Libya. The two operations in Africa, carried out by the best-equipped and most . heavily trained commandos in the United States, come a week and a half . after al-Shabab terrorists slaughtered 67 people during a massacre at . the upscale Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi.

'Kids and families were wanting pictures taken with Blaze - it happens wherever we go,' he said. 'He's such a lovely bird and always happy to pose.

He added: 'This is a public park - it was a total humiliation.' A spokesman for The Helix said 'casual staff' who had been on duty had made a mistake. He said: 'As it was the opening day, it was very busy with 15,000 visitors. The staff in question thought Blaze might take fright. 'It was a mistake and they should not have been asked to leave.

Thomas Orchard (pictured) died after a restraining belt was fastened across his face while in police custody . Four police officers are facing prosecution after a prisoner died in custody when a restraining belt was fixed across his face. Church caretaker Thomas Orchard, 32, collapsed in a police cell after the belt was fastened across his mouth to stop him from 'spitting or biting' following his arrest in October last year, it has been reported. Mr Orchard, who suffered from schizophrenia, was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead on October 10 after a week in a coma. The Independent Police Complaints Commission submitted a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether charges should be brought against four officers from Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, two members of the custody staff and a nurse employed by a contractor. According to a report in The Times, a Government memorandum seen by the newspaper has suggested an emergency response belt was used on Mr Orchard to stop him from 'spitting or biting'. The IPCC has confirmed to MailOnline that it looked at 'restraint techniques and equipment used during Mr Orchard's arrest and detention' as part of its investigation. An IPCC spokesman said: 'The IPCC investigation into the death of Thomas Orchard led to a file of evidence submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service and the Health and Safety Executive. 'We are awaiting their decisions. 'The investigation has concluded and has looked at CCTV footage; taken statements; interviewed officers and custody staff; and reviewed relevant policies and training. 'The investigation has also looked at restraint techniques and any equipment used during Mr Orchard 's arrest and detention.' Mr Orchard's family has told Channel 4 News they had concerns over the use of emergency response belts. His . sister Jo said: 'We don't know how, or why – fully – that it [the . emergency response belt] was applied.' Mr Orchard was taken to Heavitree Road Police Station (pictured) following his arrest in Exeter in October last year . Mr Orchard was arrested in Exeter on October 3 on suspicion of a public order offences and taken by police van to Heavitree Road Police Station at 11.10am. Just over an hour later he was taken by ambulance to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital where he was placed in an induced coma in intensive care. He did not recover consciousness however when his sedation was lifted and he was pronounced dead on October 10. 'The investigation has also looked at restraint techniques and any equipment used during Mr Orchard's arrest and detention' - An IPCC spokesman . After the IPCC handed over its file to the CPS, Commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne said: 'This file of evidence concerns Mr Orchard's time in custody and relates to two custody detention staff, three police officers, one custody sergeant and a nurse who is employed by a contractor. 'It will be a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether criminal charges will be brought against any of those police staff involved in Mr Orchard's detention on that day.' Channel 4 News has reported Mr Orchard's death was discussed at a meeting in February of the Ministerial Board of Deaths in Custody, which noted 'the company which supplied the equipment [Emergency Response Belt] had been training forces on its use as a hood to prevent spitting and biting'. Minutes from the meeting also states: 'ACPO did not endorse its use as a spit/bite hood'. According to reports, police forces nationwide have now been warned against using the belts in this way. The police force meanwhile has refused a request by the IPCC for the staff involved in the incident to be suspended. A Devon and Cornwall Constabulary spokesman said: 'Following this incident the Force has assisted the IPCC where ever possible in gathering information regarding their enquiry. 'An assessment was carried out by the Deputy Chief Constable and it was decided the staff concerned remaining at work on restricted duties would not impact or prejudice the investigation in any way. 'It’s important to note that no-one has been criminally charged in relation to Mr Orchard’s death and this investigation remains at an information gathering stage. 'The staff concerned have been moved to temporary roles which do not have direct contact with the public and are outside of custody. This follows Home Office guidance around the suspension of officers. 'We now await further advice from the IPCC concerning any developments with potential prosecutions.' The force also said custody procedures 'are constantly reviewed as is any equipment used in the custody environment'.","Thomas Orchard collapsed in a police cell following his arrest last year .

When artworks by famous landscaper John Constable go under the hammer, they can expect to fetch well in excess of £20m. But now the beautiful countryside on which arguably Britain's most famous painter based many of works is up for sale at a bargain price of £1.75m. A total of 231 acres of land in Dedham Vale - just north of Colchester on the Suffolk and Essex border - have been put up for sale. Art history: The land for sale is near the village of Dedham, whose church featured in John Constable's painting Dedham Lock and Mill . It features water meadows, lowland grass, arable farmland and fishing rights, so the new owner will be buying themselves a piece of quintessential English history. Constable's 1831 masterpiece Salisbury Cathedral was bought by The Tate in May 2013 for £23.1m and last year 2012 The Lock became one of the most expensive British paintings ever sold when it fetched £22.4m at auction. So whilst the £1.75m asking price may be out of reach of many art fans, it is still less than 10 per cent of the price of each of those two iconic paintings. Inspired: The Essex and Suffolk countryside featured in some of Constable's most famous works, such as The Hay Wain . Water bargain: The picturesque land is up for sale at £1.75m . Popular: The land could well be snapped up by an American, as people from the US have a huge passion for John Constable, the seller has said . The land for sale even features in one of Constable's most famous works, The Dedham Vale, painted in 1802. Countryside campaigners are calling on the National Trust to buy the land to safeguard its future for the nation. Robert Erith, president of the Dedham Vale Society, said: ‘The land on the Essex side of the River Stour was given by my family to the National Trust in the early Fifties and it would be a very nice thing if the National Trust were to own the Suffolk side as well. ‘There is very little any landowner could do with it apart from keeping it natural because it is in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and associated with John Constable who painted in that part of the country. Reel worth: Whoever snaps up the land will enjoy 1,200m of fishing rights along the River Stour . Plea: Countryside campaigners are calling on the National Trust to buy the land . ‘There are a lot of potential buyers who would be likely to appreciate the sensitivity of the landscape but if the National Trust were to buy it, it would then belong to the nation. ‘ . The land - which is privately owned by a local farm - could even be snapped up by rich Americans who have a passion for Constable who was born in nearby East Bergholt. Chris Leney, of Robinson and Hall, which is marketing the land, said: ‘Americans seem to have a lot of interest in Constable. ‘We have sold a lot [of land] to them over the years around there. ‘We have two or threes potential types of buyers. We have farmer buyers who might buy it to graze cattle; investor buyers who would see it as an investment for pension funds or other funding and the third sort, because of its location, will be interested in Constable himself and the history.’ Whoever snaps up the land, they will be unable to make any great changes to its character because it is protected as it is within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. They will, though, be able to enjoy 1,200m of fishing rights along the River Stour, 90 acres of arable farmland and 142 acres of water meadows.","A total of 231 acres of land on the Suffolk and Essex border is up for sale .

Chris McGarry was humiliated when a member of the Supermarket giant's staff accused him of shoplifting. The 19-year-old had already paid for his shopping but he was challenged as he left the store. Shameful: Chris McGarry was with his mother Margaret when Tesco staff at this store in Northumberland falsely accused him of stealing a whole trolley of food . Mr McGarry was with his mother Margaret Reynolds when the incident happened at the branch in Bedlington, Northumberland, last month. He said: 'As we were leaving a member of staff came up to us and said we had not paid for what was in the trolley. 'I explained that we had and pointed to the checkout where I had paid. 'I had to do this three times but she did not take any notice of what I was saying. 'When she pulled us up we were still in the shop and we felt uncomfortable in case there were people we knew. 'We showed her the till receipt proving we had paid but she did not say sorry, or even say anything at all, and we left the supermarket. 'By this time the team leader had arrived and confirmed I had paid.' Upsetting: The 19-year-old was confronted as he wheeled away his trolley having paid with cash . He complained to the store afterwards and was given a £5 gift voucher but said said the amount was an insult for the allegation that he was a thief. His card had been rejected after an unexpected withdrawal from his card account when he tried to pay. So he left the trolley behind and left the store for a few minutes while he went to a nearby bank and got some cash from a different account. He said: 'The checkout assistant said it was all right to leave the trolley and come back later. 'So I got the cash and went back into the store. 'I wanted to go to the same checkout but she was busy so I went to the next one along. I paid at the second checkout and thought nothing of it at that point. 'It was after I paid that the first checkout assistant came to us and accused us of trying to take the trolley.' Tesco said today the issues has been resolved.

Dubbed Flour Power, the team from McGill University plan to farm grasshoppers in poor areas of countries including Mexico, Thailand and Kenya and turn them into flour for bread and other foods. It will provide a sustainable, year-round source of food as well as provide an extra business opportunity for local farmers. Students from Montreal have won $1million to turn grasshoppers, pictured, in poor countries into flour to be used as a sustainable food source. Dubbed Flour Power, the team from McGill University plan to farm the insects in areas of countries including Mexico, Thailand and Kenya . Around 10 tonnes of grasshoppers are due to be delivered to Mexico by March. Farmers will turn them into flour for bread and distribute the protein-rich substance to poor areas .

The Flour Power project was created by MBA students Mohammed Ashour, Shobhita Soor, Jesse Pearlstein, Zev Thompson and Gabe Mott, who call themselves the Aspire Food Group. They plan to collect a crop of grasshoppers from infested alfalfa fields and distribute them to farmers in Oaxaca, Mexico. The insects are caught, washed and drained. They are then dried and placed in a sealed freezer bag to kill them humanely. Each insect is washed again and are dried out in an oven. They can then be ground until they resemble the consistency of wheat germ. Insect flour can be used for bread, in cakes, soups, stews, sauces and more. Each farmer will be given containers that help them harvest the insects, before the bugs are ground into a protein-rich flour. Around 10 tonnes of grasshoppers are due to be delivered to Mexico by March 2014, and the group plan to extend the initiative to other insects in the future. The insects are dried and placed in a sealed freezer bag to kill them humanely. Each insect is washed again and dried out before being ground to resemble the consistency of wheat germ. This flour can be shipped to local businesses and bakeries to be turned into bread, tortillas and other flour-based food.

Hundreds of millions of pounds of British aid money poured into a corrupt and conflict-ravaged African country have been wasted, a damning official report reveals. More than half of European Union projects aimed at bringing stability to the Democratic Republic of Congo have failed to deliver any results, spending watchdogs say. Auditors issued the scathing findings after assessing aid programmes which received £1.6billion funding from the EU between 2003 and 2011. Funding flop: At least half of EU projects aimed at stabilising the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo have failed to deliver any results, a damning report has revealed (file picture) 'Same old story': Men carry bags of tin ore and coltan, which is used in mobile phones from the Mudere mine. The EU projects were expected to tackle poverty, but have been criticsed for not being spent properly . During that period the UK gave the DR . Congo – a vast mineral-rich nation plagued by poverty and civil war – . around £240million through the EU. But more than half the European aid . has effectively been poured down the drain. In one instance, bureaucrats in . Brussels were criticised after it emerged that 1,000 police officers . trained in 2005 had ‘vanished without trace’ by last year. For decades the authorities in the . capital Kinshasa have struggled to tackle rebels intent on seizing . power. The 16 development projects focused on boosting peace, security . and justice, good governance, health and education. But the European Court of Auditors found that progress was ‘slow, uneven and limited’. The auditors said: ‘Fewer than half of . the programmes examined have delivered, or are likely to deliver, most . of the expected results. Sustainability is an unrealistic prospect in . most cases.’ The report concluded the EU needed to ‘improve significantly its aid effectiveness’ in DR Congo. The auditors urged the European Commission to tighten up monitoring of such programmes to ensure money was not misspent. And they noted that fraud and corruption remained big problems in the troubled nation. The report found that despite the DR . Congo being one of the world’s poorest countries, MPs’ salaries were . increased ten-fold from just over £800 in 2003 to £8,000 last year, . although this rise did not come from EU funds. Marta Andreasen, a Tory MEP and former . EC chief accountant, said: ‘This is the same old story. The commission . is not ensuring that taxpayers’ money is being spent properly. The . question has to be asked: When will the European Commission wake up and . treat the money that is entrusted to them with respect?' Surveying the scene: Defence Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague with actress and UNHCR Special Envoy Angelina Jolie during a visit to Nzolo camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo in March . Britain’s Department for International . Development (DfID) said: ‘The EU needs to raise its game. That’s why we . are calling on EU institutions, MEPs and other member states to improve . performance and results.’ EU development commissioner Andris Piebalgs said it was premature to judge projects which had not been completed. In the last elections in DR Congo in . 2011, president Joseph Kabila faced allegations of vote-rigging. He has . also been accused of cracking down on opponents. The new revelations highlight the controversy of hard-pressed British taxpayers being asked to fund spurious aid projects. The EU has been criticised by auditors . for failing to measure the impact of the handouts, with much of the . money lining the pockets of corrupt regimes. The Government has carried out a . review of how aid money is spent. But ministers have insisted on . increasing the DfID’s budget at a time of austerity at home.

Harry Redknapp gave the fraudster cash handouts, tickets to football matches and paid for dinners . Harry Redknapp reveals today how he was conned for three years by a fake jockey who he bankrolled in return for racing tips. The football manager was introduced to the ‘promising apprentice’ one evening at the London casino Les Ambassadeurs. Redknapp tells the story in his autobiography Always Managing, which is serialised in the Daily Mail this week. In the series he slams the FA as ‘clueless’, tells of his battle to clear his name over tax fraud charges and describes the devastating effect of the case on his wife Sandra. The young man at the casino was introduced to him as ‘Lee Topliss’ – the name of a real jockey – and Redknapp, then in charge of Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, recalled how he seemed a ‘nice kid’. ‘He wasn’t dressed too well, looked like he could do with a few quid, but very open and chatty,’ wrote Redknapp. ‘If you like a bet, he seemed like a good man to know.’ Conversation between the pair turned from racing to football and the ‘jockey’ told how he ‘loved Tottenham – the only problem is I can never get a ticket’. But thanks to the generosity of Redknapp, that was about to change. ‘Suddenly, he was at near enough every home game,’ he said. ‘He’d ring me up, give me a few tips for horses – they usually got beat – and then arrange to come to the match at the weekend.’ ‘Lee’ would even enjoy games in the directors’ box at Manchester United and Arsenal – and for one game sat in a private box next to billionaire Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. On occasions Redknapp would treat his young friend to dinner and was amazed at how the apprentice, who would need to be at a certain weight in order to meet handicapping requirements, would ‘tuck into his food’. Redknapp said: ‘I took him to a lovely Italian in Chelsea and he was eating steak and drinking wine and I said, “Lee, how can you eat all this if you’re riding tomorrow?’’ and he said, ‘“Don’t worry ‘Arry. I’ll go for a run at 5am and sweat it all out in the sauna.”’ The former Tottenham manager, pictured at Newbury, is a keen horse racing fan. Right, the real Lee Topliss . At one stage, the young man told . Redknapp that he had been offered the chance to ride for the famous . Godolphin stable in Dubai where he could win big prize money. Then . he explained that he could not afford the air fare. The Premier League . manager lent him £500. ‘I never saw that again, prize money or not,’ he . recalled. After Redknapp left Tottenham and had taken over at Queens Park Rangers his jockey friend switched his allegiance and in May this year he had a place in the directors’ box at Anfield when QPR travelled to play Liverpool. After the game he said he did not have the train fare to get to the races at Newbury the next day. It has been a turbulent year for Redknapp whose QPR team was relegated from the Premier League in May . Once again, Redknapp felt sorry for him and bankrolled him with £150. Weeks later Redknapp fielded a call from football agent Willie McKay who asked if he was still in touch with his friend ‘Lee Topliss’. ‘Yeah, he’s always ringing me, more losers than winners,’ said Redknapp. ‘He’s not Lee Topliss,’ said McKay. ‘He’s a potman at a boozer in  Newmarket. He picks up glasses – he’s not a f****** jockey.’ Redknapp wrote: ‘Three years he’d had me. The best seat in the house, good restaurants, lifts here, there and everywhere – and heaven knows what in handouts.’ Ironically, the conman was only found out after he had given McKay a ‘rare, successful’ tip and the agent happened to be at a Doncaster race meeting where the real Topliss was riding. McKay spotted Topliss standing with his back to him in the paddock. He tapped him on the shoulder, introduced himself as ‘Harry’s mate’ and thanked him for the winning tip. Redknapp said: ‘The jockey stared at Willie as if he was mad ... Then Willie began to study the lad’s face. ‘It wasn’t the “Lee Topliss” he knew, the one he had met with me at Les Ambassadeurs.’ Redknapp said he always regarded himself as streetwise but the fake jockey had been in a ‘different class’. ‘He was a conman preying on the racing scene and the little rogue had us all.’ A spokesman for the real Lee Topliss, 24, who has ridden around 100 winners, said he did not wish to comment. It has been a turbulent year for Redknapp whose QPR team was relegated from the Premier League in May. In February he was cleared of tax fraud at Southwark Crown Court.

A pensioner who has always admired her granddaughter's tattoos surprised her family when she announced she wanted some body art of her own. Eve Codling, 85, from Burnley, Lancashire, endured a 20 minute procedure to have red rose etched onto her upper arm. The work of art was carried out by her granddaughter, Beki Sanderson, 26, who opened her own tattoo studio in Accrington, Lancs, six years ago. Never too old for body art: Eve Codling, 85, proudly shows off her first tattoo . Inspiration: Eve had always admired her granddaughter Beki Sanderson's tattoos . Family affair: As Beki is a tattoo artist, she etched the rose on her grandmother's arm . 'Prickly feeling': The great-grandmother said it didn't hurt . Married Eve, who has six grandchildren and five great grandchildren, explained: 'I'm incredibly proud of Beki and I think her tattoos are wonderful. 'I think it's . so marvellous that they can do all this beautiful artwork on flesh and I . wanted to show appreciation for Beki and her work, so I asked if she . would do a tattoo for me.' As she was: Eve, aged ten, left, used to live in Hertfordshire and was once a Wren in the RAF . She married Stanley in 1948: He said he likes her tattoo but wouldn't want one himself . The retired shop worker, who was born in Hertfordshire and was once a Wren in the RAF, chose the floral design in honour of her late mother, whose first name was Rose. She said: 'I'm very happy with my tattoo. I'm happy I chose a Rose for my mother. My middle name is also Rose and it symbolises the Lancashire rose so I am very pleased with it indeed. 'I . didn’t think it hurt at all, it was more like a prickly feeling. But I . do think one tattoo is enough for me and I won’t be getting anymore . done.' Beki, who has a seven-year-old daughter, Lexie, said she was initially reluctant to fulfil her grandmother's wishes. Proud: Eve with Beki as a baby . Grown up: Beki now has her own tattoo studio in Accrington . She . said: 'I don't think anyone in the family really believed grandma when . she kept saying she wanted me to do a tattoo for her. I think we all . thought she'd gone a bit mad. 'But she kept on asking and then one Saturday we were out having coffee and grandma turned to me and said ""when are you going to do my tattoo?"" that's when I realised she was being serious. 'I had a slot free that afternoon so I brought her into the studio and sat her down at my work station. I kept asking ""are you sure you want to do this, grandma?"" but she was one hundred per cent certain so we just got on with it from there. Beki has many tattoos and admitted she was initially reluctant to tattoo her grandmother in case she hurt her . Flower power: Eve chose a rose in memory of her mother . Delighted with the result: Beki thought her grandmother had been kidding about getting a tattoo but was happy to oblige when she knew she was serious . She added: 'I was absolutely petrified about tattooing my gran. I was worried it was going to hurt her but she just didn't seem phased at all. She didn't squirm, she just sat there and said ""ooh"" a few times. I was definitely more nervous than she was. 'The tattoo took about twenty minutes altogether. After I'd finished gran seemed really impressed with the final result and now she's always showing it off to her friends.'

Computer controlled convoys of up to ten lorries could soon be driving along Britain's motorways in a bid to reduce the number of people killed in collisions with freight vehicles and cut fuel emissions. The Department for Transport is to consider introducing the automated 'platoons' with a lead vehicle communicating with following trucks via Wifi. The system, which was tested on a motorway in Sweden last week, could be trialled on UK roads as early as December. Trial run: Computerised convoys of up to ten lorries could become a fixture on UK roads in a bid to cut road deaths and fuel emissions (file picture) A DfT fact finding team, led by chief engineer Bernie Frost, has been sent to Sweden to monitor the tests. But while the Swedish trials are said to have gone well, the AA has raised concerns that the system could 'confuse and intimidate' drivers on Britain's busy motorways. There are also fears that the computerised technology could be vulnerable to computer hackers. Scientists from lorry manufacturer Scania claim that emissions would be lowered by as much as 10 per cent if the system was used and fuel costs would be reduced. Warning: The AA is concerned that Britain's roads are too small and too busy for the system to work . They claim that it could also ease traffic with reduced gaps between vehicles in the convoys allowing for more traffic on the roads. The firm is hoping to persuade European Governments to alter the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic to permit automated driving on the roads. Gunnar Tornmalm from Scania told The Times: 'Technology is safer than drivers, particularly in bad weather.' But president of the AA, Edmund King, says that while the system may be useful on deserted roads in other countries, Britain's roads are too small and too busy for it to work effectively. He told The Times: 'There would be obvious dangers of long platoons blocking road sign, obstructing cars getting on and off the motorway and intimidating some drivers.' The DfT however, claims that the convoy system could have 'huge benefits' if implemented on UK roads. The system is effectively controlled by a lead vehicle which sets the following distance and speed. Although drivers in following trucks control steering, the system automatically controls accelerating and braking. The position of each lorry is monitored using cameras and the close formation of the vehicles reduces drag, therefore improving fuel efficiency. Europe's freight haulage is responsible for 10 per cent of the 35,000 deaths on European roads every year.","Automated 'platoons' are currently being trialled on Swedish motorways .

'Let me in': Betting shop robber Timothy Stern, 31, did not like being far from his family . A convict on the run from jail stunned guards when he knocked on the door of another prison and asked to be let in. Timothy Stern, 31, begged officials at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire to let him come back after escaping from an open prison more than 70 miles away. The betting shop robber said he wanted to return to the high-security jail to be closer to his family. Stern’s good behaviour had seen him transferred to minimum-security Leyhill, near Bristol, in August. But he walked out and turned up at his old jail 24 hours later asking to be let in. He is now back at his preferred prison, but has had 21 days added to his sentence. Stern walked out of open prison HMP Leyhill, in Wotton-Under-Edge near Bristol, on September 26, Oxford Crown Court was told. Within a day, he walked up to the gates at Bullingdon in Arncott, Oxfordshire, and asked to be let in. Instead Stern, who was serving a three-and-a-half year sentence for the knifepoint robbery, was asked to sit on a grass verge for the police to arrive. Cathy Olliver, prosecuting, said he was transfered to the open prison from Bullingdon for good behaviour in August. But, Stern was unhappy at being so far away from his Oxford family and after failing to move to a much closer prison decided to escape. Peter Du Feu, defending, said that after escaping from prison in Bristol, his client was on the loose for 24 hours. He said he went to visit his partner and three children, before heading back to Bullingdon The barrister said: 'He knocked on the door and asked to be let back in. Where he wanted to be: Bullingdon, near his family in Oxford, is more than 70 miles from the prison he was in . Too far: Stern was moved to Leyhill in Bristol for good behaviour. But he said it was too far from his family . Sentenced: Stern had 21 days added to his sentence for robbing a betting shop but gets to stay where he wants . 'They said they couldn’t possibly let him in, but could he sit on the verge and wait for the police. 'The nature of open prisons is to try to integrate prisoners back into the community, which clearly he couldn’t do so far away. 'He was only free for 24 hours and then went back to Bullingdon. He has been there since.' Judge Mary Jane Mowat sentenced Stern of Blackbird Leys Road, Blackbird Leys, Oxford, to a further 21 days inside.

Growing numbers of the elderly and disabled are being looked after in ‘flying’ visits from carers that last just 15 minutes, a leading charity has warned. UK charity Leonard Cheshire Disability said that time is so tight during the short home visits that some of the most vulnerable are forced to choose between having a cup of tea or being helped to go to the toilet. Its call for an end to the ‘scandal of flying 15-minute visits’ is backed by TV presenter Esther Rantzen who said that the disabled are being treated ‘like products on a conveyor belt’. Rush job: Growing numbers of the elderly and disabled are being looked after in 'flying' visits from carers that last just 15 minutes, a leading charity has warned (file picture) The warning comes amid growing concern that cash-strapped councils are putting the elderly and disabled in danger by cutting back on the amount of time carers have to provide help with basic tasks, including dressing, bathing and heating up meals. Rushed visits are particularly distressing for those with dementia and raise the odds that mistakes will be made when dispensing medication. Leonard Cheshire Disability’s survey of English local authorities found that two-thirds are commissioning visits of just 15 minutes. The figure is up 15 per cent on five years ago. The responses from 63 councils revealed that in some areas, three-quarters of all home visits are completed in a quarter of an hour or less. One 84-year-old woman who receives a 15-minute visit in the afternoon, said: ‘I end up choosing – have I got time to check if they can fill the hot water bottle? TV personality Esther Rantzen said: 'I believe it is cruel to treat people like products on a conveyor belt' ‘Shall I choose between getting my meal prepared or them emptying my commode. ‘Do I get a drink or do I go to the toilet? ‘These visits are company.  I get really lonely and I rely on the visits of my carers but they are never stopping long.’ Claire Pelham, Leonard Cheshire Disabilty’s chief executive, said: ‘It is disgraceful to force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or go to the toilet by providing care visits as short as 15 minutes long. ‘Most of us need 40 minutes to get up, get washed and dressed and have breakfast in the morning. ‘We should demand better from our councillors and remind them that disabled people are real people with real feelings and should be treated as they themselves would wish to be treated – with kindness, with care and with respect.’ Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘People with a disability should not have to make choices between on essential care function or another because visits are being scheduled for so little time.’ Esther Rantzen said: ‘I believe it is cruel to treat people like products on a conveyor belt. ‘Providing this kind of care is a personal service and should be accompanied by a conversation and at least half an hour of the car worker’s time.’ The charity is calling for the Care Bill, which will be debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday, to be amended to make care visits at least 30 minutes long. But social care leaders said that sometimes 15-minute visits are ‘fully justified’. Sandie Keene, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said: ‘It is totally wrong to believe that all tasks need more than 15 minutes to carry out. ‘And frankly naive to believe that simply by abolishing 15-minute slots a magic wand will have been waved, and improvements automatically achieved in our care services. It doesn’t work like that.’","UK charity Leonard Cheshire Disability has called for an end to the 'scandal of flying 15-minute visits'

Two Cabinet ministers are at war over plans to slash green subsidies blamed for skyrocketing household bills. Chancellor George Osborne wants to use his autumn budget statement to raid the power giant’s energy tariffs. But he is facing a battle with Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who does not believe there is any justification in tearing up previously agreed targets. The Chancellor has been angered by Labour leader Ed Miliband’s plan to freeze energy bills if elected. Clash: Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey (left) was incensed by Osborne's plans to abandon carbon targets . Mr Osborne blames Mr Miliband’s ‘green’ policies as Labour’s Energy Secretary for helping force up bills. Figures released yesterday show that families face paying an extra £425 over the next five years to pay for subsidies to meet green energy targets. The total subsidy - levied on householders and businesses - will be nearly £22 billion by 2020, according to figures produced by the Taxpayers’ Alliance. The money will go towards paying for controversial onshore and offshore windfarms, biomass plants, landfill gas siets and hydro power plants. The Chancellor won applause at Tory conference when he pledged that Britain would not be at the forefront of tackling climate change. But Mr Davey believes there is no justification for back-sliding on carbon reduction targets. Almost £2 billion was spent subsidising renewable energy in the last financial year. But this will rise to £5.3 billion a year by 2018-19. Wind farms will account for the majority of the rise. Matthew Sinclair, Taxpayers Alliance chief executive, said subsidies for renewable generation should instead be used to support research aimed at bringing down the cost of green power. He said: 'Targets that require massive investment in the energy sector, to install expensive technologies like offshore wind turbines on an enormous scale, will always mean profits for energy companies and much higher prices for consumers. Costs: Wind farms account for the majority of the rise in money spent on renewable energy . ‘If the Government are serious about easing the pressure on people’s living standards, they need to take action and scrap lavish renewable energy subsidies. ‘And it is a joke for Ed Miliband to pretend he is taking on the Big Six on behalf of consumers when he is proposing to keep the targets in place. 'If politicians are serious about helping families with struggling bills, then they need to do something about dysfunctional and painfully expensive energy policies.’ Dr Lee Moroney of the Renewable Energy Foundation, said: ‘Government subsidies which are added to electricity bills in order to meet over ambitious EU climate change targets are complex, opaque, and very expensive for the consumer. ‘The subsidy costs are set to increase significantly and will last 15 to 25 years. 'The scale of the consumer costs is shocking and senseless in view of the fact that UK greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced faster and more economically by less extravagant measures.’ Biomass plants (pictured), landfill gas sets and hydro power plants are funded in controversial energy policies . Domestic energy prices are set to rise yet again this winter with the ‘Big Six’ power firms blaming the increase on government and environmental levies. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘The Government is transparent about the impact of energy and climate policies on bills. ‘It’s the global gas price, not green subsidies, that has primarily been pushing up energy bills. 60 per cent of the increase in household energy bills between 2010 and 2012 was caused by this. 'Investing in home grown alternatives is the only sure fire way of insulating our economy and bill payers from this volatility. ‘In any case, our household energy efficiency policies are on average more than offsetting the costs of clean energy investment. 'By 2020 the average household bill will be £166 lower than it would be if we were doing nothing.’","George Osborne blames Ed Miliband's 'green' policies for forcing up bills .

Donna Asutaits who was jailed after making £300,000 without paying a penny in tax must pay back £174,243 or serve two and a half years jail . A £1,000 a night call girl who was jailed after making £300,000 without paying a penny in tax must pay back £174,243 or serve two and a half years jail. Donna Asutaits, 30, started working as a prostitute to fund a masters degree at the University of Westminster, Southwark Crown Court heard. Asutaits made so much she was able to afford a £110,000 deposit on her £360,000 apartment in the sought after area of Knightsbridge in March 2007. When police raided her home they found £73,000 in cash and high value jewellery which was given to her by her clients. She was jailed for 16 months in July last year after admitting one count of cheating the public revenue. Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay said the escort failed to file any tax returns for most of her working career. He added that Asutaits cheated the taxman out of £120,000 between 2005 and 2007. ‘This defendant was working for years as an escort and in that job she received significant sums of money’, Mr Polnay said. ‘To give an example of this was put a deposit on her flat on Brompton Road. ‘This deposit, of £110,000 was paid in cash by the defendant, so clearly that money was available as profit, and available as cash. ‘In addition, in relation to another investigation, police carried out a search of her property and found £72,702 in cash. ‘In addition high value jewellery was found. ‘When this defendant was arrested in relation to this matter in November 2011, a further £6,200 in cash was found. ‘When she was arrested she read out a pre-prepared statement in which she said she had been a self-employed escort for about ten years, and that she was often paid in cash and received valuable jewellery in gifts.’ Judge Peter Testar made an order under the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act for Asutaits to the repay £120,000 she owed in tax with £54,243 in costs. ‘I am told about extensive talks between the parties and it is thought that a fair resolution has been agreed’, Judge Testar said. Asutaits, 30, started working as a prostitute to fund a masters degree at the University of Westminster, Southwark Crown Court heard . Asutaits made so much she was able to afford a £110,000 deposit on her £360,000 apartment in the sought after area of Knightsbridge in March 2007 . ‘I am told that the amount that would be regarded in benefit is £173,234 and so that amount will be paid to the Treasury and will no doubt be disposed of in various ways.’ Asutaits, who was in the public gallery for the hearing, is still being investigated for her tax evasion, the court heard. ‘I am told that the defendant is still subject to a continuing investigation by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs into her affairs, so it may be that this inquiry will continue elsewhere’, Judge Testar added. Stan Reiz, defending, said Asutaits is planning to sell her Knightsbridge flat to help pay the confiscation order. ‘It is lamentable that any young woman should have to come to London and do this kind of work in order to support herself,’ he said. ‘Her family have been embarrassed by these proceedings, not only because of the offence but because they didn’t know she was working as an escort in the first place. ‘The criminal offence was committed in naivety on her part, as she was only 22 when this started. ‘Since this has been hanging over her, she had suffered from depression and insomnia and has taken illicit drugs, and has dropped out of her masters degree.’Asutaits has three months to pay £174,243 or she will face another two-and-a-half years behind bars.","Donna Asutaits, 30, worked as a prostitute to fund a masters degree .

Sergeant Sanjay Rai has been jailed for six months after he was found guilty of downloading more than 200 indecent images and films of young girls . A decorated Metropolitan Police officer who claimed it was part of his job to download pornographic images of children has been jailed for six months. Sergeant Sanjay Rai, 40, downloaded more than 200 indecent images and films of young girls while he was based in Lewisham, southeast London, between September 2006 and January last year. Rai, who received three commendations for bravery during his 20-year career with the force, said it was ‘necessary’ for him to download the images for the purposes of crime prevention. The collection included 127 level four pictures - the second most serious type of material, Southwark Crown Court heard. Rai was charged following his arrest on February 2 last year and has since been suspended, pending disciplinary proceedings. He denied four counts of making indecent images but was convicted by a jury following a trial earlier this month. The court heard he had an ‘alarming’ lack of remorse or insight into his offences. The hearing was told he continued to remain in denial and intended to lodge an appeal. Sentencing Rai, Judge Deborah Taylor told him: 'The jury rejected the defence you raised that it was necessary to download these images for the purposes of the prevention of crime. 'That’s to say your defence was you were carrying out research to prepare courses in child trafficking which you proposed to develop outside your work as a police officer. 'No one from the authorities was informed about your research and you didn’t inform them about the type of activity you were doing. 'It’s clear you don’t accept the guilty verdict. But the fact is the jury did find you guilty, it wasn’t necessary to download those images, and you have shown no remorse in respect of that. 'These are serious offences and you knew that downloading such images was very clearly regulated by the law, to prevent exploitation of vulnerable and young children and also the circulation and demand for such images.' Hearing: Southwark Crown Court heard Rai continued to remain in denial and intended to lodge an appeal . Rai shook his head throughout the hearing and appeared to be on the verge of tears as the sentence was passed. He waved to his wife, sitting among friends and relatives in the public gallery, who wept as he was led out of the dock to begin his sentence. Prosecutor Piers von Berg told the court Rai downloaded a total of 226 images including 39 level one, 25 level two and 35 at level three. 'It’s clear you don’t accept the guilty verdict. But . the fact is the jury did find you guilty, it wasn’t necessary to . download those images, and you have shown no remorse in respect of that' -  Judge Deborah Taylor . ‘The images were of children aged between 12 and 15 and involved a combination of photographs and moving images. ‘Clearly this involves a public official, a police officer. From the evidence, at least four of the images were stored and the defendant said in interview that he viewed up to 75 of the images.’ Michael Forward, defending Rai, a re-married father-of-one, said he was ‘exceptionally disappointed’ with the jury’s verdict and intended to lodge an appeal. ‘In the course of his 20 year career he has received three commendations. ‘The defendant, over a period of five to six years prior to his arrest, was involved in preparing courses for a number of outside companies for which he had prior permission from the Metropolitan Police. ‘There was no permission sought in relation to him downloading the images he did. The jury didn’t accept it was necessary for him to download any images for the preparation of any course he intended to do.’ But Mr Forward insisted Rai had not distributed the porn and was ‘not part of any wider circle of moving images around the internet.’ Rai, from Strood, Rochester, Kent, denied four counts of making indecent images of children. He was cleared of a fifth charge of failing to disclose any code in relation to material authorities were trying to access during the investigation.","Sgt Sanjay Rai downloaded more than 200 indecent images and films .

"'You can loop ‘em, roll ‘em, spin ‘em and side-slip them,' says pilot, 90 . By . Lizzie Edmonds . PUBLISHED: . 11:19 EST, 6 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:44 EST, 6 October 2013 . For most remaining World War Two pilots, taking to the skies in a 1940s plane is a distant memory - one that is unlikely to ever be repeated. But, having not sat at the controls for more than seventy years, one 90-year-old pilot is now regularly flying a Tiger Moth biplane - and is even doing aerobatic loop the loops in the skies above the Peak District. Flight Lieutenant Fred Lamprey of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR) has been flying in planes almost identical to the one he learnt to fly in when he was called up in 1942. Scroll down for video . Up and away: Fred Lamprey, pictured in the front seat, flies above purple heather in the Peak District on his latest flight in a Tiger Moth . Daredevil: The former RAF pilot, pictured in flying goggles and hat, takes a turns the plane, which he first learnt to fly in 1942 . In the driving seat: Mr Lamprey, from Ackworth, West Yorkshire, flew in the Tiger Moth for the first time in seventy years last autumn . Mr Lamprey said: 'It doesn’t seem over seventy years since I first soloed in one. 'They’re a very interesting and versatile aircraft. You can loop ‘em, roll ‘em, spin ‘em and side-slip them. 'The petrol tank is between the . wings above you and it’s a gravity feed.  If you roll it the engine can . stop so you have to go into a dive to get the fuel flowing again and the . engine restarted.' 'Flying is very nostalgic. I remembered the controls instantly – it’s like riding a bike.' Back in time: Fred Lamprey after being awarded his wings in 1944 after two years of training . Flying Instructor, Will Flanagan said the daredevil often begs him to push the aircraft to its limits - and frequently asks if he can loop the plane. He said: 'He’s got the lightest of touch. It’s like with golf – it’s technique not strength that counts. 'He’s so sharp he must have been an amazing pilot in his day.' Mr Lamprey, from Ackworth, West Yorkshire, first went up for an experience flight in the 1940 Tiger Moth last Autumn to celebrate his 90th birthday at Netherthorpe Airfield near Worksop, South Yorkshire. He now regularly returns to the airfield to take to the skies. His selection for flying training began in 1942 when he was nineteen-years-old, where he was put through tough medical, dental and physical tests. Mr Lamprey said: 'We had to be good at maths too. I was asked to guess the length of a telegraph pole outside and how to work out the volume of the ink-well on the desk. I was lucky I’d just finished school so it wasn’t too hard.' The pilot was then put on a Pilot Navigator and Bomb Aimer course and was sent to the Aircrew Receiving Centre at Lords cricket ground where his night vision was tested. At the Initial training Wing in Scarborough, Mr Lamprey joined other new pilots learning meteorology, navigation, armament, clay pigeon shooting, signals and aircraft recognition. Mr Lamprey said: 'After three months I was issued with my Kaypook [inner flying suit], outer flying suit, helmet and goggles. 'I was sent to grading school at Southam, near Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. In action: Mr Lamprey flies a Fairchild Cornell - another training aircraft - over Canada in 1943 . One of the boys: A photo showing Fred Lamprey, bottom right, and his Sunderland flying boat crew . 'I had a good instructor. He first took me out and taught me how to swing the prop to get it started, sometimes you had to tap the magneto with a stone. 'The first time I flew a Tiger Moth it was scary. I’d never flown before. It looked and felt very big. 'When I first went solo my . instructor said, ""You’ll be ok"" but warned me it would feel lighter with . just me in it. I was fifteen feet too high for my first landing and had . to go round again. 'Our first flight was a half-hour familiarisation flight. Then it was turns and landings. We learned to do two controlled spins in either direction and were checked by the Chief Flying Instructor at eight and then twelve hours before our first solo flights. 'Those who didn’t pass these tests became navigators and bomb aimers.' In training: Fred Lamprey's 'You are going to be a pilot' booklet, given to all trainees, from 1942 . He continued: 'I was posted to Manchester into a unit for overseas postings. I nearly went to Rhodesia but was ill with shingles for a week so took the next draft to Canada. 'I sailed from Greenock to New York on The Queen Mary. She was painted Battleship Grey and we zig-zagged our way across The Atlantic unescorted. We were used to city black-outs and New York looked amazing all lit up. 'We caught a train to Canada and I began more training flying Cornells. We learned formation, night and cross-country flying, circuits and landings, instruments and aerobatics.' 'Like riding a bike': My Lamprey is now a regular flyer after first returning to the skies last year . Daredevil: Mr Lamprey asks to push the plane to its limit and always suggests doing rolls, his instructor says . He began flying Cessa Cranes out of Yorktown where he passed out 2nd of 30 pilots and was awarded his wings. He then trained on Coastal Command and practiced monitoring shipping movements in Halifax harbour in a twin-engined Avro Anson from his base on Prince Edward Island. Mr Lamprey said: 'Later in 1944 I was given the chance to go back to Blighty to fly Sunderlands. These were giant flying boats – much bigger than a Lancaster. Based in Alness, Scotland I was second pilot, part of a crew of nine. 'The war ended and these aircraft became surplus to requirements. I flew one to Lough Erne in Ireland to be scrapped.' After the war the pilot returned to being a fitter, later worked for Hoover and then went into business for himself. The Tiger Moth is a 1930s biplane, a fixed-wing aircraft with two main wings stacked one above the other, designed by Geoffrey de Havilland. It was derived from the Gipsy Moth model in response to Air Ministry calls for a training aircraft. From the outset, the Tiger Moth proved to be an ideal trainer - simple and cheap to own and maintain. However, they were not the easiest to fly as control movements required a sure hand due to slow control inputs. Instructors often preferred these flight characteristics because of the effect of 'weeding' out the inept student pilot. The Tiger Moth was operated by the Royal Air Force  and others as a primary trainer until it was replaced by the Chipmunk in 1952. Many other nations used the Tiger Moth in both military and civil applications, and it remains in widespread use as a recreational aircraft in many countries. It is still occasionally used as a primary training aircraft, particularly for those pilots wanting to gain experience before moving on to other larger aircraft.","Fred Lamprey, part of the RAF Volunteer Reserve, was called up in 1942 and learnt to fly in the magnificent Tiger Moth biplane in Warwickshire .

Patricia Bell tricked councillors she worked for into thinking they were signing legitimate cheques after she had written the correct name using a special pen . A council clerk used an erasable pen to steal £162,000 of taxpayers money to bankroll a 'shopping addiction'. Patricia Bell tricked councillors she worked for into thinking they were signing legitimate cheques which she had filled out in ink. But once they had signed them Bell, a Whitehill Town Council clerk, would remove the name by heating the ink. She would then fill her details into the blank space. Today Bell, 58, who earned £46,000 a year, was jailed for 28 months after a judge heard she used the stolen funds to pay for expensive handbags and holidays. She paid £110,000 worth of altered cheques into her account and transferred another £45,000 pounds worth of additional cheques, which included extra salary payments. Bell also claimed £7,000 worth of expenses including food shopping bills, receipts and eBay purchases - taking the total to £162,000. Winchester Crown Court heard she used the money to fuel a 'shopping addiction' which enabled her to pay for holidays, handbags and nail manicures. Bell stole the huge sum of money from Whitehill Town Council in Hampshire during a five year period. Prosecutor Tom Wright said that she abused her position of trust within the council. He said: 'Mrs Bell had a position of trust in a small council who all work very hard. 'But over the years cheques and balances were eroded by her manipulation. 'In 2012, the council noticed that it was running a deficit in several of its accounts. 'Mrs Bell had been in sole control of payments including invoicing and the pay roll. 'Her system operated on a cash and cheque basis and she ended up exploiting this system. 'She would get cheques signed by councillors. Her method was to write the payee’s name on the cheque using a fabric pen - a pen that uses special ink that can be easily removed. 'Mrs Bell would write a legitimate name on the cheque and get a councillor to sign it - they trusted her after her long time at the council. 'She would then rub out the initial payee’s name and fill in her own details on the cheque. By doing this, she was able to take large sums of money from the council.' Once councillors identified financial irregularities an internal investigation was launched and Bell was forced to attend a meeting with senior councillors. She admitted the allegations were true and was suspended for potential gross misconduct. The council then commissioned an independent investigator to ascertain the facts of the financial irregularities.On February 18, 2013, the council dismissed Bell on the grounds she abused procedures to pay herself by falsifying reports, accounts and expense claims. Bell was then arrested and later charged with fraud by abuse of position. Anthony Rimmer, defending, claimed his client had worked hard in the public sector up until the incidents that took place from 2007. Once they had signed them Bell, 58, would remove the correct name by heating the ink and replace it with her details . Today Bell, 58, who earned £46,000 a year in her role for the council, was jailed for 28 months after a judge heard she used the stolen funds to pay for expensive handbags and holidays . He said: 'Mrs Bell had spent 37 years working in the public sector, working for Action for Children and other district councils. 'It was only until she turned 53 that she started doing this. She would often throw away the fabric pens in a bid to stop what she was doing, but ended up buying more.' The former chairman and treasurer of the Hampshire Society of Local Councils pleaded guilty to one count of fraud by abuse of position. She sat in the dock with her head down for most of the sentencing, holding a box of tissues throughout. Bell would write a legitimate name on the cheque and get a councillor to sign it - then erase it . The married mother-of-two was wearing a black and grey striped dress and tears streamed down her face when her sentence was read out. Judge Linda Sullivan said: 'In May 2006, you were employed by Whitehill Town Council as the town council clerk and financial officer. 'You had a salary of £46,000 pounds. Nevertheless, in April 2007 you started to behave in a sophisticated and fraudulent way to obtain 162,000 pounds from Whitehill Town Council. 'Of that figure, £110,000 was obtained by altering cheques using a fabric pen. But once your cheques were signed you removed the correct name by heating the ink. 'You were finally dismissed in December 2012 and it seems you spent the money on holidays, expensive handbags and nail manicures. 'I have no doubt that you maximised the ease of how you were able to take this money and you did so in a sophisticated fashion.' New council clerk Chris Young, who worked under Bell, replaced her after she was suspended and today described her as being 'glamorous'. The 61-year-old said: 'She was well presented and always looked very glamorous. 'She would often come into work with a new handbag and her nails and hair were always immaculate.'","Patricia Bell tricked councillors into signing cheques she had filled out .

Dead: Dejuan Gladney, 18, was killed in the shootout on Saturday night at a biker annual dance party in Fresno, California . Authorities Sunday were investigating what touched off a wild ‘running gun battle’ inside and outside a Fresno motorcycle club's annual dance, leaving one man dead and at least a dozen other wounded. Shots were still being fired at 2 a.m. Saturday when the first of more than 100 law enforcement officers arrived at the Soul Brothers clubhouse near Fresno, the Fresno County Sheriff's Office said. The Fresno County coroner identified the dead man Sunday as Dejuan Gladney, 18. The coroner didn't list a hometown. The gunfire erupted during the Soul Brothers' annual dance, which draws bikers and other motorcycle clubs from all over the state. About 500 people were inside the warehouse-like clubhouse when the shooting started. The . shooting quickly tuned into ‘a running gun battle’ in the street . outside the club, and hundreds of partygoers were running for cover when . the first officers arrived, sheriff's spokesman Chris Curtice said.

Despite briefly detaining and questioning about 100 people, authorities have yet to make an arrest. Gladney and several injured people were found in the clubhouse, which is in an unincorporated neighborhood of Fresno County called Calwa. Another victim was on a nearby street. Curtice said the injuries ranged from minor to ‘extremely serious’. Authorities have not released the names of the people who were wounded. Large gatherings of bikers descend on Fresno twice a year, once in the spring and then again in fall, the Fresno Bee reported. The gatherings frequently turn violent, the newspaper said, but police blame gangs for starting some of the violence rather than the bikers themselves.

Talented: Many of the youngsters can already hunt and kill birds flying 100 metres high in the air and can spear fish in the local river with just one hit . Aim: A young Indian girl gazes straight ahead as she draws back an arrow, ready to shoot . Future champion? This Amazonian boy could one day be a gold medalist in archery . They hunt talented children from indigenous Indian tribes - many whom can already hunt and kill birds flying 100 metres high in the air and can spear fish in the river with just one hit. They believe the youngsters have the potential to become successful competitors in archery in the Rio de Janeiro games. The Brazilian scouts also explore the world's largest rainforest - home to about 400 Indian tribes - for skilled kayakers and canoeists. 'I find archers with innate ability,' said Marcia Lot, an Olympic selector from the Amazonas Sustainable Foundation (FAS), who has been combining the jungle for talent since February. Potential: The children, who belong to tribes in the world's largest rainforest, have the potential to become successful competitors in archery in the Rio de Janeiro games . Hereditary: Traditional archery skills are believed to have been passed down from generation to generation . 'This strong tradition has been handed down from generation to generation and passed from parents to children. 'Now, the indigenous youngsters are interested in using their skills to change their life.' Ms Lot's hunt has taken her to eight tribal communities with different ethnic groups, including the Xingu, Kambeba and Aldeia Kuana tribes. More than 80 candidates were initially chosen - all of whom were believed to possess 'natural' bow and arrow skills. After a series of qualifying tournaments held by the Amazonian Federation of Archery (FATARCO) in June, the numbers were whittled down to the top 10. Further trials are set to take place this month, with selectors choosing their final top three. They will then continue with advanced training, before being put forward for the Olympics. Practice: Ms Lot's hunt has taken her to eight tribal communities with different ethnic groups, including the Xingu, Kambeba and Aldeia Kuana tribes . Ready, aim, shoot: Three youngsters line up and prepare to shoot their arrows at a distant target . 'We plan to take the three official members to the National Athletic Championship - held in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, from November 10 to 17, to feel the atmosphere of the competition and to start preparing them for the 2016 Olympics,' said Ms Lot. To find elite Olympic material, the FAS has concentrated its efforts on teenagers born in the heart of the rainforest who it believes have both archery skills and the discipline needed to become a professional in the sport. 'They can hunt and hit a macaw flying 100 metres up in the air and spear a fish in the river,' said FAS chief executive Virgilio Viana. 'The challenge for us now is to mix this traditional wisdom which is in their blood with the cutting edge technology of the Olympic sports.' Roberval Fernando dos Santos, FATARCO’s Brazilian archery coach, added: 'We are selecting young people with discipline, character, stable family backgrounds and emotional structure.'

The 10 fledgling athletes have moved . from their villages in the jungle to live for a few weeks in the Olympic . Village in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas. There, they are undergoing intensive technique training with dos Santos. 'Professional archery is very different from what they are accustomed to practising on a daily basis, he said. 'They have had to learn posture, coordination, alignment and anchoring, as well as the release and follow-through of the arrow. 'They have built up their strength and concentration - and because of their inherent abilities, they have accelerated through the training and we are seeing their talents emerge.' One of the 10 trainees is Jardel Cruz Gomes, 16, from the Kambeba tribe in the Cuieras region near the Rio Negro. His very first toy was a bow and arrow, and he is currently the 2013 champion of archery at the 6th edition of the Indigenous Games. 'I hope I'm one of the three selected,' he said. 'I would love to bring a medal home. Not just for me but for my whole community.' Water sports: The scouts say their next step in 2014 is to find talented canoeing and kayaking champions - with natives using the numerous waterways coursing through the jungle as their highways . For indigenous Indian families, the training project is being seen as an important step. 'Formerly, . the indigenous peoples were forgotten. Not today. We are being looked . at more closely and valued for what we have to offer,' said Mr Gomes's . father. Traditionally used as a weapon of war, the bow and arrow is now used for hunting, fishing and rituals by indigenous tribes. It has also become a sport, played between villages and in the annual Indigenous Games. Most of the Brazilian Indian tribes make the bow from the stem of a palm tree called Tucum, which is dark in colour and found very close to the river. The arrow is made from a kind of bamboo or bamboo thicket called Caninha. Tips are formed with the wood of the arrow or some natives use bones and the teeth of animals. Olympic selectors are planning more scouting trips to tap into the natural skills of the country's Indian tribes. They say their next step in 2014 is to find talented canoeing and kayaking champions - with natives using the numerous waterways coursing through the jungle as their highways.","Brazil talent scouts search the Amazon rainforest for talented youngsters .

Death: Jacqueline Allwood died from a blood clot last year, but was misdiagnosed with a calf sprain . A woman suffering from deep vein thrombosis was told to take ibuprofen and ‘wear comfortable shoes’ when a doctor misdiagnosed her condition as a sprain, an inquest heard today. A coroner condemned Dr Saurabh Adlakha for neglect after he failed to ask about her family history or refer her to Accident & Emergency. Jacqueline Allwood, 47 - who died ten days later  - had gone to the Beckenham Beacon Urgent Care Centre in south-east London fearing a sore right calf might have indicated DVT. A receptionist referred the mother - who had been ‘limping around’ and had a family history of DVT - to the adjoining Cator Medical Centre, which deals with minor conditions, to see a GP. A second receptionist then warned Ms Allwood she faced a two-hour wait, so could either ‘go away or wait to see a doctor’. She decided to wait and eventually saw a doctor. Dr Adlakha, who examined her, ruled out DVT in favour of a sprain he said she probably suffered while packing up her Christmas tree days earlier, Southwark Coroner’s Court heard. He sent her home and told her to rest, take ibuprofen, apply ice and wear comfortable shoes. She died ten days later, with a post-mortem examination indicating a blood clot in her calf had travelled to her lung. Coroner Dr Andrew Harris said Dr Adlakha should be referred to the General . Medical Council to see if there was any training he could be given to prevent a similar event happening again. Referral: Ms Allwood went to the Beckenham Beacon Urgent Care Centre (pictured) in south-east London fearing a sore right calf might have indicated DVT . Medical . expert Dr Patrick Harborow told the court in Central London that the . misdiagnosis could have been representative of a system-wide failure of . the time pressures facing GPs. ‘I . do feel that general practitioners are working under very serious time . pressures,’ he said. ‘My concern is... the time pressures may lead to . inadequate consultations.’ He said Dr Adlakha committed ‘very serious failures’ by not considering Ms Allwood’s family history or conducting proper tests. He recommended Dr Adlakha be referred to the General Medical Council. But Dr Adlakha denied he was rushed and insisted he had determined the pain was the result of a sprain because he could see no swelling or other symptoms of DVT. However, he conceded he should have asked more about Ms Allwood’s family history and his threshold for referring patients for further tests had lowered since the incident. Dr Adlakha told the court he would conduct more thorough tests in the future because ‘I don’t want to be here again’. He said: ‘It is only the registration details we see, so we go ahead and take a medical history. Ms Allwood had been in pain for four days - it was not a recent trauma with no swelling in leg. ‘She had pain but I don’t remember her limping. I can’t remember if I asked her about her family history. I didn’t assess whether any of the risk factors for DVT applied. ‘I asked why she was here and she said she had pain in her right calf. I asked her to expose it and she said she was worried about DVT. ‘I asked if there was anything she could think of that would give this pain and she said she had been in the loft lifting decorations and I said maybe she had just sprained her calf. ‘I told her to take ibuprofen and wear comfortable shoes and gave her some exercises. ‘It does matter if a diagnosis of a clot . is missed because it could breakaway and go to the lungs or brain, and . there are treatments to prevent that.’ Inquest: Dr Saurabh Adlakha told Southwark Coroner's Court (file picture) in Central London he would conduct more thorough tests in the future because 'I don't want to be here again' Ms Allwood’s daughter Tanya Allwood said Dr Adlahka knew the family’s history of DVT because she made a point of mentioning it in his office. She told the inquest: ‘We were seen by a doctor at about 5.35am and I went in with her because she had trouble walking and was leaning on me for support. ‘Mum rolled up her trouser leg and explained she felt her leg was swollen and had trouble walking. ‘The doctor asked her to roll up her . other trouser leg and said we can rule out a DVT, as the leg would have . to be severely swollen to indicate that. ‘We both said we were relieved it wasn’t DVT because it runs in our family, and the doctor said it was simply a sprain.’ She said she then told the doctor: “Oh, that is really good it’s not a DVT - we thought it was because it runs in the family”. She . added: ‘My nan suffered with DVT and my aunt has had blood clots. He . asked if there was anything mum could have done and I said about her . getting decorations out of the loft on a ladder. 'We both said we were relieved it wasn’t DVT because it runs in our family, and the doctor said it was simply a sprain' Tanya Allwood, daughter . ‘The doctor gave her seven to ten days recovery period, gave her ibuprofen, told her about some exercises she could do and advised her to use an ice pack. He looked at her legs for a matter of seconds.’ Recording a narrative verdict, the coroner said: ‘I find it improbable to . believe that the family wouldn't have mentioned their history to the . doctor so conclude the referral to DVT was made. ‘Dr . Harborow said he should have referred to the history. The consequences . of missing this are in this case catastrophic. I record a narrative . verdict. With respect to the history taken and non-referral to A&E, I . find Dr Adlakha in neglect. ‘He . was not the most credible witness and appeared confused. I am going to . refer this to the GMC. There are uncertainties about what has happened . and why it happened.' After the verdict, sisters Tanya and Leanne Allwood said in a statement: ‘We are very pleased with the coroner's verdict. He was very thorough and he gave us a conclusion that confirmed everything that we thought and were suspicious of. ‘In a sense this is closure because we feel justified because sometimes things happen and someone is looking at it the same way as us and agrees with that. ‘I just want Dr Adlakha to look at the things he did and do it differently. We don't need him to be punished but retrained again. We never want to see another family go through that. We're just glad we got the verdict and will see what happens next.’ The two girls also paid tribute to their ‘sincere’ mum, who used to be an accounts manager: ‘She was funny, loveable and trustworthy - one of the most sincere and nicest people you could meet.’","Jacqueline Allwood went to Beckenham Beacon Urgent Care Centre .

"By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 19:46 EST, 6 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:21 EST, 7 October 2013 . Adam Afriyie, pictured with his wife Tracy-Jane, has been accused of de-stabilising the government . David Cameron moved last night to crush a bid to hold a referendum on British membership of the EU next year as the Tories were pitched into fresh turmoil on Europe. Tory backbencher Adam Afriyie, who has been accused of plotting against Mr Cameron, announced plans to table an amendment to legislation which paves the way for a promised vote in 2017. The Prime Minister has pledged to hold an in-out referendum after renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels following the next election, if he wins. But Mr Afriyie – who is reputed to have 25 supporters lined up for a future leadership bid – said the public was ‘not convinced’ Mr Cameron would stick to his promise. He revealed he will give MPs the chance to vote for a referendum in 2014 instead when Tory James Wharton’s referendum bill is debated next on November 8. In an article for the Mail on Sunday, he wrote: ‘Only by setting an early date can we kick-start EU renegotiation talks and give the British people what they so clearly want – a say on our country’s future with Europe.’ Mr Wharton warned that his bill – which is backed by Downing Street – could be ‘killed’ if the amendment is debated since backbench bills get very little parliamentary time, allowing Labour to talk it out. ‘I’d like to see my bill go through and I think this harms the chances of that happening,’ he said. The amendment is also a major headache for Mr Cameron since the 81 Tory MPs who previously rebelled over a referendum will now come under huge pressure to back the plan for an early vote. Senior Tories accused Mr Afriyie of seeking to ‘destabilise’ the Prime Minister ‘at any cost’ and branded him a ‘fantasist’ with ‘little grip on reality’. Under pressure: The Prime Minister blasted Afriyie's amendment. But many Tories are not convinced . Causing a stir: Adam Afriyie, Tory MP for Windsor, is said to have 25 MPs' support for a leadership coup . A No 10 source said: ‘We will not allow this amendment to be passed under any circumstances. The PM will not let it stand’. Home Secretary Theresa May warned that Mr Afriyie had ‘got it wrong’. Prominent Eurosceptics privately expressed anger that they may be forced to choose between wrecking Mr Wharton’s bill, which they support, and voting against a referendum for which they have campaigned for years. MPs privately expressed incredulity that Mr Afriyie appeared not to have discussed the plan with any of the leading Eurosceptics. Philip Davies, who launched the Better Off Out group in 2006, spoke for many: ‘Should there be a vote, I would be compelled to support it since it’s something I have campaigned for all my career. ‘However, I’ve never known Adam Afriyie care about the subject in his life. It’s totally self-indulgent behaviour. He’s going to put lots of my colleagues in a very difficult position.’ If Mr Afriyie had hoped to use his gambit to boost his chances of succeeding Mr Cameron, it appeared to have failed, with Tory MPs queuing up to condemn his grandstanding. Labour’s Tom Watson and Keith Vaz both backed an early referendum but Ed Miliband’s aides refused to say whether he will vote with his conscience to oppose a vote or seek to inflict a tactical victory on Mr Cameron. ‘We will respond to the amendment after it has been published,’ a source said. Nick Clegg will lay into the Tories this week, using a speech on Europe to warn that Mr Cameron’s EU referendum promise is ‘deeply flawed and bound to unravel’. But UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage backed an early referendum.","Backbencher Adam Afriyie plans to table an amendment for a vote in 2017 .

Sentenced: Phillips Idowu (pictured today), 34, from Epping, Essex, pleaded guilty to drink driving . Phillips Idowu was today banned from the road - after being caught drink driving when police were called to a domestic incident at his home. The 34-year-old former Olympic triple jumper from Epping, Essex, pleaded guilty to driving his white Land Rover in the town’s Bridge Hill while two and a half times the legal alcohol limit. Appearing at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court wearing a grey suit with a blue shirt with a white collar and a yellow tie, Idowu was also ordered to complete community service after the incident. An Essex Police spokesman said after the case today: 'We were called to reports of a domestic argument at a property shortly before 9.30am. A man had left the scene prior to police arriving and was subsequently arrested.' Joe Life, defending, told the court he had been out with friends the previous night and returned home to bed, ahead of the incident which happened at about 9.30am on September 20. Ms Life said: ‘He just got in the car because circumstances forced him to leave the house in a hurry and he was driving a short distance.’ She did not elaborate on what had happened, but added: ‘He planned to stay at a hotel which was under a mile away to get away from the circumstances which had unfolded at the house.’ Ms Life said Idowu had co-operated with police and regularly helps charities and schools. Idowu, described by officers as ‘unemployed’, has no income and is living off savings, the court heard. He had asked to be fined rather than given community service as he had an job opportunity abroad beginning next month, the court was told. But magistrates ordered him to complete 50 hours of unpaid work in the next 12 months. Idowu was banned from driving for 24 months and must pay a fine of £145 and £85 costs. Sentencing, Magistrate Jeremy Bachelor told Idowu: ‘I don’t need to tell you how seriously courts around the country take these offences.’ Athlete: Idowu appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court wearing a grey suit with a blue shirt and a yellow tie . Triple jumper: Phillips Idowu at the Beijing Olympics five years ago in 2008, where he won a silver medal . After the hearing, Idowu denied there had been a domestic incident. Wearing a grey tracksuit and flat cap, Mr Idowu said from his home today: 'There was no incident.' But a neighbour said: 'The police knocked on our door and asked about an incident at the house on the end that morning, but that's all I know.' Idowu has previously spoken of his long-term relationship with his Spanish girlfriend, Carlita, with whom he has two children. The athlete won a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and World Championship gold in Berlin the following year. He was a hot tip for gold at last year’s London Olympics but a leg and hip injury thwarted his medal hopes and he failed to make it through to the final. Idowu has stopped short of retiring from track and field competition but has announced he is taking an extended break from athletics ‘for the foreseeable future’.","Idowu, 34, of Epping, Essex, drove while two and a half times legal limit .

A mother-to-be who masterminded a vicious gang beating of an innocent man after he was falsely accused by a group of vigilante 'paedophile hunters' has been jailed for 16 weeks. College student Rachel Ashworth, 28, was one of three people who launched a sustained assault on Antonio Cressoti, a vulnerable epileptic, after she saw his name on the controversial Predators Watch website. She and her accomplices invaded his home on a quiet Sunday morning, forcing him back into the property when he answered the door, flooring him and knocking him out. The victim, 39, was kicked, punched, had his ornaments hurled at him, was smashed over the head with his own trophy and was left bleeding and injured. He was so terrified and traumatised by his horrific ordeal, he fled his hometown. After the beating, Ashworth, from Colne, Lancashire, bragged on Facebook that she had 'defo found the right one,' and that his face would be a mess. She said she had enjoyed the violence and added: 'I even jumped on his head myself.' During the boast she declared: 'Any paedophile deserves hanging.' Mr Cressoti was wholly innocent and had never been a sex offender. But he had wrongly been labelled an 'active predator,' on the website which has been accused of routinely naming innocent people as paedophiles - then demanding money for the names to be removed. After her arrest, Ashworth was to claim to the police that he was a paedophile and it was 'all over the internet.' Mr Cressoti, who was kept in hospital a day, suffered a broken rib, for which he had to take strong painkillers for two months afterwards, as well as cuts and bruises in the premeditated assault at his home on June 16. The court was told he is a completely innocent man and has never been convicted of any sexual offence. Vilified: Totally innocent victim Antonio Cressoti, a vulnerable epileptic, was falsely branded a paedophile on website Predator Watch . At Burnley Crown Court, first time offender Ashworth - who is now 15 weeks pregnant with her first child admitted - assault causing actual bodily harm and was jailed for 16 months. Her two accomplices have not been traced after Ashworth refused to name them. Sentencing, Judge Beverley Lunt said: 'This was vigilantism, wrongly. You identified this entirely innocent man and he’s now seeking help with mental issues, suffers panic attacks, his epilepsy has been made worse and he’s moved out of the area because he was afraid to stay where he was.' 'The Facebook entries were total bravado and disgraceful and demonstrate you showed no remorse whatsoever. 'You are 15 weeks pregnant, but that cannot be used as a shield to stop an appropriate sentence being imposed.' Earlier Miss Kimberley Obrusik, prosecuting, told the court the victim was at his home when he heard banging on the door about 9.30am. He opened it and saw Ashworth who he had known for about a month and two unidentified men. Ashworth shouted: 'You are a paedophile b*****d', and was subjected to further verbal abuse before being punched by one of the men. He fell backwards and all three began kicking and and punching him while he was on the floor, while continuing to call him a paedophile. Sentencing at Burnley Crown Court, pictured, Judge Beverley Lunt told Ashworth: 'You identified this entirely innocent man and he's now seeking help with mental issues, suffers panic attacks' Mr Cressoti managed to get to his feet, was hit over the head with a trophy and was bleeding from a cut. All the gang then threw ornaments at him and carried on kicking and punching him. The prosecutor continued: 'He must have become unconscious as the next thing he was aware of was hearing a car speeding away. He called the police and ambulance and was kept in hospital for 24 hours.' She said: 'He suffers from epilepsy and was vulnerable. Since the assault, there have been significant complications.' Miss Obrusik told the court: 'The complainant has no antecedents for any sexual offences in any way.' She said Ashworth found the complainant’s details on a website called 'Predators Watch' where he was detailed as an 'active predator'. The fraudulent website would put details on and want money for them to be removed. The prosecutor said Ashworth was arrested after the Facebook message. She said she met the victim about a month before and didn’t trust him from the beginning. She alleged he had threatened to shoot her during the incident and she had thrown an ornament at his head. In mitigation Kristian Cavanagh, for Ashworth, said she was studying for a diploma in beauty therapy. The solicitor continued: 'The defendant knows this is a very serious offence. She well understands this offence crosses the custody threshold. 'She recognises that it was a stupid thing to do, including the entry on Facebook. She took it off within an hour and has since left Facebook.' The case comes after another a group of self-appointed online 'paedophile hunters' Letzgo Hunting closed down after it was linked to the suicide of a Leicestershire man it had confronted and accused of attempting to groom a child. The group attracted controversy for its tactic of identifying suspected sex offenders by posing as teenage girls on social networking sites. Its adult decoys engaged men in conversation and, when they believed they had evidence the men were sexually attracted to children, agreed to meet them in public places while still posing as the teenage girl. At the meeting, the decoys revealed their real identities. They filmed the encounters and posted the footage online, before passing their material including transcripts of online exchanges to police.","Rachel Ashworth, 28, led the vicious attack on vulnerable epileptic victim .

Savannah Underwood, 18, was pushed in a wheelchair, her broken leg in a cast, to the funeral held Friday for Malak Hariri. It was the first funeral for victims of the violent collision, which also killed Sameer Nevarez, Sugey Cuevas, Stephen Stoll and Sebastian Forero. Ms Underwood was found by police about 50 yards away from the charred Nissan sedan when they arrived shortly after 4 a.m.Investigators intially said she was thrown from the car, but she told them she crawled out of the wreckage. Lucky: Savannah Underwood so0mehow managed to crawl away from the wreckage, avoiding the fire that burned her friends alive . Severely injured: Ms Underwood suffered a crushed pelvis and a broken right leg in the accident . Ms Underwood suffered a broken leg and a crushed pelvis in the accident, according to KTLA. She was released Thursday from Los Angeles County Medical Center. Her appearance at Ms Malak's funeral was the first time she had publicly paid tribute to any of her fallen friends. The wheelchair-confined young woman was visibly distraught and carrying flowers, she did not speak to the media. Though Ms Underwood smelled of alcohol the night of the crash, investigators are awaiting toxicology test results to determine if drinking or drugs played a factor in the smash, KTLA reported. The five young adults all appear to have been friends since attending Burbank High School and graduated within the past few years. Tributes poured in from the school community and devastated family and friends of those who died. ‘Heaven gained 5 angels today and . they gave us clear skies and a beautiful day. Rest in paradise. You will . never be forgotten,’ wrote Jamie Hizzle. A relative of Malak Hariri simply wrote: 'No words'. 'She's a very smart girl, very good girl, very respectful girl.

Fatalities: Stephen Stoll (left) and Sebastian Forero (right) were both killed in the shocking accident . Also killed: Sugey Cuevas was trapped inside and killed when the vehicle burst into flames . Too soon: Malak Hariri died just years after graduating high school . Officials said they were still looking into the cause of the accident but feared speed could have been a factor. The curving stretch of roadway has a posted 45 mph speed limit, but vehicles often fly off the freeway at speeds closer to 70 mph, and accidents have happened in the area in the past, according to authorities. The accident took place around 4am but by the time the emergency services reached the vehicle it was too late. Fire Battalion Chief Ron Barone told Fox: 'There was absolutely no possibility of any rescue whatsoever'.

I'm really curvy, but I don't really like my hips or . love handles. 'I've got a really small waist - but there's a 10-12 inch . difference between my waist and my hips, which is huge.' Motherhood added . to those insecurities: Luisa put on three-and-a-half-stone when she was . pregnant with daughter, Dixie and struggled for years to get her figure back. To regain . confidence, she had a breast enhancement. 'When you are pregnant you can . lose sight of who you are and, for me, getting a boob job was part of . being me again. Fluctuating: Luisa explained that in the past her weight had yoyo-ed from anywhere between 9st 3lb at her heaviest to 8st 2lb at her lightest - she is finally happy with her current body . 'My boobs had turned into empty sacks after my pregnancy, . so I had them boosted from 32C to a 32E,' she explained. But she was still left with . what she calls a 'jelly belly.' She said: 'I was unhappy with how my . stomach looked from having a baby – I had a bit of a jelly belly. 'I . always keep a close eye on my weight and it can fluctuate quite a lot. I can go anywhere from just over 9st to 8st 2lb, which is my ideal . weight.' Luisa has now hit her target weight thanks to her new exercise and healthy eating regime. She has been doing home workout sessions - quick 30 minute work-out sessions which combine squat thrusts, burpees, leg raises crunches and press ups. Finally happy: Luisa put on three-and-a-half-stone when she was pregnant with daughter, Dixie - and struggled for years to get her figure back, but now, at 8st 2lbs, is happy with her body . She will switch body parts on . alternate days, so legs and abs Monday, chest and arms Wednesday, Cardio . Friday and she takes the weekend off. She . has been sticking to a high-protein, low-carb diet, with porridge or fresh . fruit and Greek yoghurt in the mornings, soup for lunch and a fish or . chicken with no skin and salad for an early evening meal. She has also imposed a 'carb curfew' at around 6.30pm and will have very little to eat after that time. She has cut out all fruit juices and tries to drink two litres of water a day, and has only green tea as a hot drink. Holiday figure: Luisa was targetted by online bullies who branded her 'fat' in these Marbella pictures . Her danger time, however, comes at around 4pm when she has cravings for snacks . so her only option was to turn to diet pills to curb the cravings. She said: 'I'm a snacker at heart so I'll usually . pick at anything that's around me. But when I take a Forza Raspberry . Ketone in the morning and afternoon, my snacking habits are curbed. 'They are like willpower in pill form. I feel more energised and . taking the capsules has not really affected my lifestyle at all. I . have lost the weight despite still being partial to the odd cake.' Fans of the diet pills include Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Roxanne Pallett and Spencer Matthews. Madeleine Shaw, a nutritionist who works with Millie Mackintosh, said: 'I think eating a wholefood diet is the most important thing. 'Adding supplements is great but if you still stuffing your face with pizza then you won't be able to be the healthiest version of you. Insecure: The 26-year-old entrepreneur has admitted that she had a range of 'body issues' after failing to shift what she describes as her 'mummy tummy' and 'unsightly love handles' 'The problem with supplements is our body doesn't recognise them as well, we absorb food best in its whole form.' Cassandra . Barns, nutritional therapist at The Nutri Centre, added: 'Raspberry . ketones are a popular ingredient for weight loss – they are thought to . work by increasing breakdown of fat (lipolysis) and the burning of fats . for energy (thermogenesis). 'One . ingredient that may be more controversial in this product is caffeine: . while it can stimulate the metabolism and assist weight loss in some . individuals, it can be too stimulating for some people, causing or . exacerbating anxiety and insomnia. 'It is also thought that caffeine may exacerbate weight problems in some people, especially those who are ""apple-shape"".' 'I feel great. I lost my target weight of a stone and I am now at my idea weight of 8st 2lb,' added Luisa.","Apprentice star admits she has 'a lot of body .

A man posing as a 'viscount' today admitted defrauding his mother-in-law out of £150,000 while posing as a millionaire business magnate. Kirk Brown changed his name by deed poll to Vizconde von Hoehen de Bessarabia, and claimed he was due a £400m inheritance, Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court was told. Pretending to be the owner of a bogus shipping firm, the 46-year-old persuaded his wife's mother, Nicola Young, to invest £150,000 into the non-existent business. The fantasist also convinced his wife's uncle, Richard Birch, to transfer a total of £116,000 into another imaginary venture involving a Bulgarian stockbroker. Prosecutor Peter Nagle said: ‘In short, dealing with the facts...the victims were known to the defendant. ‘He [Brown] was married to Mr Birch’s niece and she is Mrs Young’s daughter. He claimed he was due a substantial inheritance of £400m. ‘He offered to invest the money in a new company to be set up between himself and Mr Birch. He asked for £50,000 in order to give Mr Birch preference shares in the company. ‘He also stated he was in control of a shipping container company based in the Seychelles and asked Mr Birch for £56,000 for buying new containers. They never arrived. ‘He also asked for a further £10,000, claiming to know a Bulgarian stock-broker ""whizz kid"". ‘When he was eventually arrested for these three allegations, at the time this is when Mrs Young came forward and in essence said the defendant asked for her to invest in the same shipping container business. ‘It is said he obtained approximately £150,000 from her. ‘The victims are known to him so there is an element of a breach of trust’, Mr Nagle added. Chair of the magistrates, Trevor Grove, said: ‘This is a matter suitable only for the Crown Court for sentence.'

And when her third kid was born, farm manager Anthony Moore, 32, was surprised. Mr Moore said: 'I couldn't believe it. 'We've sometimes had triplets and that excites us but Jemima still looked big after the three and it was clear she was still in labour. 'Brett, the stocksman said, ""I'm sure there's a fourth one"", and we all had our fingers crossed because it has never happened here before. 'We were shocked when she delivered another.

Lookalike: The araneus mitificus spider, left, is said by photographer Anand Joshi, to bear a striking resemblance to Borat in his mankini, right . He immediately grabbed his camera after noticing the likeness the spider bears to Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy character. As well as looking like the protagonist of Baron Cohen's controversial 2006 film, which grossed more than $260million at the box office, Anand said that his friends have been comparing the eight-legged creature to aliens and other Hollywood movie predators. He said: 'When I first saw the spider I immediately noticed a human face with a moustache.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . PUBLISHED: . 05:31 EST, 3 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:34 EST, 3 October 2013 . An ancient city called ‘Idu’ has been discovered in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq. Hidden beneath a 32 foot (10 metre) mound, the city is thought to have been a hub of activity between 3,300 and 2,900 years ago. Inscriptions made for kings in walls, tablets and stone plinths, reveal that it was once filled with luxurious palaces. The ancient city of Idu is now part of a Tell that rises about 32 feet (10 metres) above the surrounding plain. The modern day name of the site is Satu Qala and a village lies on top of the Tell . The discovery was made five years ago after a local villager found a clay tablet with the name ‘Idu’ carved in. It is thought the inscription was made by  the local kings celebrating the construction of the royal palace. Archaeologists at the University of Leipzig in Germany spent the next few years excavating the area. They believe the city of Idu spent much of its time under the control of the Assyrian Empire about 3,300 years ago. This cylinder seal dates back around 2,600 years, to a time after the Assyrians had re-conquered Idu. The seal would show a mythical scene if it was rolled on a piece of clay. It depicts a crouched bowman, who may be the god Ninurta, facing a griffon . The city is thought to have been a hub of activity between 3,300 and 2,900 years ago. The above image shows a living structure, with at least two rooms, that may date to around 2,000 years ago when the Parthian Empire controlled the area in Iraq . Assyrian civilisation can be traced back to the third millennium BC. Some of its most spectacular remains date to the first millennium BC when Assyria dominated the Middle East. The Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC) established Nimrud as his capital. His palaces were decorated with gypsum slabs carved with images of himself. During the eighth and seventh centuries BC Assyrian kings conquered the region from the Persian Gulf to the borders of Egypt. But archaeologists also found evidence that it was a fiercely independent city. Its people fought for, and won, 140 years of independence before they were reconquered by the Assyrians. Among the treasures found were artwork showing a bearded sphinx with a human head and the body of a winged lion. Above it were the words: ‘Palace of Ba'auri, king of the land of Idu, son of Edima, also king of the land of Idu.’ They also found a cylinder seal dating back roughly 2,600 years depicting a man crouching before a griffon. 'We were lucky to be one of the first teams to begin excavations in Iraq after the 2003 war,' archaeologists Cinzia Pappi told MailOnline. 'The discovery of ancient Idu at Satu Qala revealed a multicultural capital and a crossroad between norther and southern Iraq and between Iraq and Western Iran in the second and first millennia BC. 'Particularly the discovery of a local dynasty of kings fills a gap in what scholars had previously thought of as a dark age in the history ancient Iraq. 'Together these results have helped to redraw the political and historical map of the development of the Assyrian Empire.' The left image shows a clay model of a bed  something which has been found at other sites in the Middle East. On the right is a work of art showing a bearded sphinx with a human male head and the body of a winged lion . On the left is a plaque that reads 'Palace of Assurnasirpal'.  Researchers claim that it was created for Assurnasirpal II and that he must have had a palace built or rebuilt after the Assyrians had re-conquered Idu. On the right is a work of art showing a horse wearing a headstall being led by a man in a short robe . The city was hidden beneath a mound, called a tell, which is currently home to a village called Satu Qala. ‘For wide-scale excavations to continue, at least some of these houses will have to be removed,’ said archaeologists Cinzia Pappi . ‘Unfortunately, until a settlement is reached between the villagers and the Kurdistan regional government, further work is currently not possible.’ Archaeologists plan to continue excavating the site once they reach an agreement. In the meantime, a study on the materials from the site, now stored in the Erbil Museum of Antiquities, has just been completed in co-operation with the University of Pennsylvania. Together, the researchers will explore the surrounding area to determine the extent of the kingdom of Idu in its regional context . The findings have been reported in the journal Anatolica. Archaeologists are currently busy analysing artifacts already excavated. They also plan to survey the surrounding area to get a better sense of how large the kingdom of Idu was .","The city was a hub of activity in Iraq between 3,300 and 2,900 years ago.

A husband killed his wife by pushing her down the stairs and putting a skipping rope next to her body to make it look like an accident after she discovered he was having an affair, a court has heard. The body of Louise Evans, 32, was found in the hallway at her home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, after neighbours heard her scream followed by an 'almighty bang'. Her husband, Alan, is alleged to have pushed his wife of 12 years and then smothered her as she lay unconscious in the early hours of July 10 last year. Accused: Welder Alan Evans has denied pushing wife of 12 years Louise, 32, pictured together on their wedding day, down the stairs then smothering her . By the time paramedics arrived at the . couple's semi-detached house the mother-of-three’s body was already cold . and she was in the early stages of rigor mortis, Worcester Crown Court heard. The . jury were told that just before she died, Mrs Evans has discovered her husband had been having an affair with Amanda . Chadwick, in her 30s, who worked at St Mary's School, Kidderminster, . where his three children attended. Mr Evans and Ms Chadwick exchanged 'thousands' of text messages including ones detailing sexual acts, the court heard. Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC told the jury the Evans' had separated twice before he begged his wife to return. Despite . claiming he would break contact with his lover Evans bought a secret . SIM card so he could chat with her without his wife knowing. Mr . Hankin told the court: 'We know Louise Evans suspected the affair, we . can also see from the text messages between the defendant that she did . not accept that he and Amanda were just good friends. 'On . June 18 he told her the marriage was over because he no longer loved . her. She left to stay at her mother's taking the children with her, . leaving the defendant in the house by himself. 'She . returned after he assured her he would try to make the marriage work, . but she confided in a friend that he hadn't been holding up his end of . the promise. 'Louise went on . the internet to check his phone records where she said she found . thousands of texts between the defendant and Amanda. Grim discovery: A neighbour found Louise Evans 'as cold as marble' at . the bottom of a flight of stairs when she rushed around to her home in . Kidderminster, Worcestershire, the court was told . 'She . called him at work with her suspicions. After that conversation Alan . immediately telephoned Amanda and they spoke for an hour.' Evans, . wearing a grey suit, white shirt, blue tie and glasses wept in the dock . as the jury heard how his wife was found dead in their home. A couple of days before Louise died he bought a secret SIM card to make contact again. Mr . Hankin added: '...Rrather than end the affair he and Amanda Chadwick, who was at the time . still married to her now ex-husband Simon, actually continued to plan . for a life together, even talking about having children. 'And he continued that affair after his wife died.' Earlier Mr Hankin had told the jury that Evans television and phone showed he lied to police about when he had been asleep. He also revealed that Evans had been the first person to bring up the vacuum cleaner and the skipping rope in interviews. Mr Hankin said: 'He told police he had seen the [vacuum cleaner] when he had gone to have a bath earlier in the night. 'He . also said he could not remember how Louise was lying when he found her. How could that image not have been imprinted on his memory, the image . of the person you say you love lying possibly dead. 'He . was sober that night and there is no record of an illness that would . prevent him from waking up, how can he not have heard his wife, who . weighed over 12 stone, crash down the stairs. 'If she was conscious she must have screamed as she fell, and if she wasn't then there would have been an almighty crash. 'The walls were thin and the laminate flooring caused the sound to echo. It is inconsistent that he was asleep. 'He . even told police he had been woken up by his children shouting and . pushing over an iron. And he didn't sleep through his phone vibrating in . his pocket. 'You will hear him go from calm to hysterics in the 999 call later, that 999 call is a sham.'In reality we know that he had subjected her to a violent assault, her death was not an accident.' Fatal: Mother-of-three Louise Evans, 32, was found dead at the foot of the stairs at their home on 10 July . Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC had earlier set out the prosecution's case. He said: 'This case is about the murder of Louise Evans, she was the wife of the accused. 'She died between the 9th and 10th of July last year. He murdered her at their home. 'Louise was found dead at the bottom of the stairs shortly before 1am on July 10. 'The defendant denies he killed her, he says he was asleep downstairs when she must have fallen by accident to her death. 'Examination of her body shows that she did not die immediately. She lay at the bottom of the stairs for a short time. 'The . prosecution case is that the defendant pushed or threw her down the . stairs and if she did not die very shortly after then he smothered her . to death. 'A skipping rope was positioned close to her body to make it seem like she became entangled in it. Denial: Alan Evans denies pushing his wife and mother-of-three down the stairs before smothering her . 'When . a neighbour who was a registers nurse came to help the defendant she . told police that Louise’s body was already ""as cold as marble"" and that . she thought it had been left there for at least an hour-and-a-half. 'Hayley and Charles Weale, who lived . next door, shared a wall with the Evans family. The only separation was a . party wall around four inches thick. 'They told police they had become used to living with the sounds from the Evans household. 'Mr Weale even told police he could tell when they were having sex, although that had become far less frequent in recent months. 'At . around 10pm Hayley told police she heard Louise scream ‘oh my f**king . god’, the walls were thin and Hayley heard every single word, ‘oh my . f**king god’. 'This was unusual, Louise was never known to swear in front of her children. 'They . then heard what Charles said sounded like something being dragged . across a laminate floor and Hayley said sounded like the opening and . closing of drawers and banging of doors. 'At . around 11.30pm they were woken by am almighty crash. It was so loud . that Charles got up and sat at the end of the bed, it sounded like it . had come from within their own house. 'He said they heard reverberation from the double doors downstairs as if they had been slammed shut. 'If . we look at the pictures of the house you will see that number 112 [the . Evans’s house] there was also a set of double doors at the bottom of the . stairs. 'Post mortem . examinations were carried out by Dr Lawler, a home office pathologist . with over 30 years’ experience, who has examined 1,363 homicide victims. Tragic: Flowers for Louise Evans, 32, who was found dead at her home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire . 'There were injuries to Louise’s face, . it was concluded these were not from a fall as there was no abbrasion . around the injuries. 'On . further examination it was discovered she had a broken eye socket. Dr . Lawler says this type of break is most commonly found from an assault. 'It . is caused when pressure is exerted on the eye itself, changing the . pressure in the socket and fracturing the thin bone protecting the eye. 'This . injury would have been caused by a kick or a punch. Dr Lawler said the . injuries to her face could have rendered her semi-conscious or . unconscious. 'The abrasions and bruises on the rest of her body show that she was still alive when she fell down the stairs. 'No cause of death could be gained from the examination, it was recorded as unascertained. 'Dr . Lawler said in his view it was most likely that she was smothered, but . that no signs would be present of smothering, if she was unconscious . there would be no signs of a struggle, and you would not need to hold . the throat, merely close the airway.' Evans denies one count of murder. The jury was shown detailed maps of the injuries to Louise’s body as well as pictures showing her lifeless body lying at the bottom of the stairs. They were told that a vacuum cleaner was found at the top of the stairs with its hose uncoiled in a loop by the bathroom. Mr Hankin said friends told police this was 'very unusual', and that other than the skipping rope there was no sign of any other items left on the stairs. Toxicology reports showed Mrs Evans had no traces of alcohol or drugs in her system when she died. The trial, which is expected to take six weeks, continues.

The success on Sunday night was described as a 'warning shot' to mainstream politicians who are accused of letting ordinary people down over issues like immigration. Front National (FN) candidate Laurent Lopez took 40.4 percent of the vote in the first round of voting in the south eastern town of Brignoles. Another far-right party, the 'Parti de France', took 9.1 percent. Growing in strength: President of the French far-right Front National (FN) party Marine Le Pen delivers a speech during a visit in the French northeastern village of Brachay . The result led to FN leader Marine Le Pen today saying that her party is 'already the main party in France' The centre-right UMP, France’s main opposition parliamentary party, came second with 20.9 percent. The result led to Marine Le Pen, the leader of the FN - which wants to call a halt to new arrivals - today saying that her party is 'already the main party in France.' Its support has been rising consistently, with recent opinion polls suggesting it could take around 16 percent of votes in municipal elections scheduled for next March. Removed: French policemen stand guard as members of the Roma community leave a camp in Roubaix last week . Evicted: The entrance to a Roma camp as its residents were evicted . Analysts say economic mismanagement . by the ruling Socialists, including record unemployment, have all . contributed to the FN's success. But . it is the contentious issue of immigration, especially from eastern . European and Muslim countries, which the FN particularly focuses on. It says that spiralling crime figures are the result of lax European Union policies which allow thousands of undesirables to enter France. Shanty towns full of Roma gypsies have, for example, begun springing up on the edges of major cities like Paris and Marseille. The spokesman for the Socialist party called for the left to unite against the rise of the FN. He said the by-election result was a 'warning shot' ahead of the municipal elections - the first real electoral test since President Francois Hollande's Socialists came to power .

Police have released CCTV footage of . the man suspected of launching the brutal and unprovoked assault in . Westgate, Bradford, on April 1 shortly . after midnight. Wounded: Yvette Gill suffered a deep gash to the side of her head, left, which required extensive plastic surgery, right, after being smashed across the face by a man in a random attack . And despite months of recovery and treatment, the actress - who played Cindy in The Body Farm and also starred in other TV programmes, including Coronation Street, DCI Banks and Mount Pleasant - is still having trouble opening her mouth to eat and yawn. Miss Gill had . been out for a couple of drinks with her brother and his girlfriend, to take her . mind off the anniversary of the death of her daughter Maria who died five days after being born prematurely in 2009, when they were confronted by a man wielding a bottle. Miss Gill said: 'The . anniversaries are always hard, and my mum had suggested it would take . my mind off things to go to her pub for a couple of hours, instead of . being sat at home on my own.' After leaving the pub, they were walking through the city centre and noticed a man 'hassling' some girls in a phone box.

David Gilmour: 'What I teach is guys' A literature professor has caused outrage because he refuses to teach his university students works by women authors. Award-winning author David Gilmour said he doesn't love women writers enough to teach them, adding 'What I teach is guys'. His comments, made in a Random House interview, have caused backlash, with critics accusing him of hating women. However, the author of A Perfect Night to go to China, says if his students want to learn about women authors they should join another class, Gawker reported. He said students who wanted to read women authors, such as Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood, should go down the hall where 'there are people who teach women writers much, much better than I can'. Mr Gilmour, who teaches classes at University of Toronto's Victoria College, said: 'Usually at the beginning of the semester a . hand shoots up and someone asks why there aren’t any women writers in . the course.' However, far from disregarding works by women, Mr Gilmour says the reason he doesn't teach them is because he isn't passionate enough about their work. 'When I was given this job I said I would only teach the people that I truly, truly love. Unfortunately, none of those happen to be Chinese, or women,' he told Random House. The only concession on his course is Virginia Woolf, but Mr Gilmour, a former CBC presenter, says even his third-year students struggle to understand the Modernist author. Mostly though, the professor focuses on 'guys. Serious hetrosexual guys', such as Fitzgerald and Checkhov. With a focus on mostly Russian and American modern short fiction, he added: 'I can only teach stuff I love. I can’t teach stuff that I don’t.' Make the grade: Virginia Woolf, right, is included in the course that mainly includes writers such as Fitzgerald . As well as women and Chinese writers, he added that he had not yet found inspiring works by any Canadian writers. The remarks led to backlash on Twitter, with a barrage of commentators showing their distaste for his exclusion of women writers. Mr Gilmour however, brushed off the controversy, saying his remarks had been taken out of context. 'I was careless with my words,' he told the Toronto Sun. 'I said them in a such a way that they could be interpreted to be disparaging, dismissive.' He added that he had been talking French with a colleague at the time of the interview, which he blamed for distracting him from giving his interviewer his full attention. And, according to The Atlantic, Mr Gilmour claims most of his students are young women, and that he teaches authors of questionable sexuality, which he argued counteracts claims that he only likes macho men. 'I think anybody who teaches Truman Capote cannot be attacked for being an anti-anything.' he said. Excluded: Author David Gilmour teaches classes at University of Toronto's Victoria College . He added: 'I want to apologize to the people who ended up feeling like that after reading my words.' A University of Toronto statement said: 'Neither Victoria College nor the University of Toronto endorses the views attributed to David Gilmour in the article.' It added that the 'noted Canadian author and journalist, teaches elective seminars on his area of expertise, leaving other areas of literature to be taught by colleagues who can do so most effectively based on their areas of specialization.'","Students wanting women writers can take another class, David Gilmour says .

A rising number of children are using portable tablet computers to access the internet without adult supervision, say experts. The use of handheld devices such as iPads by under-15s tripled in the past year, sparking fears they are able to bypass parental safety filters by using public wireless networks. A report by media watchdog Ofcom revealed that 42 per cent of children now use tablets, up from 14 per cent last year, while 28 per cent of children aged three and four use the devices at home. Fears: The three-fold rise in the number of children using tablet computers has sparked concerns they will be able to bypass security filters (file picture) The study also found that fewer parents have internet security measures installed on their household computers than last year, with just 43 per cent enabling ‘safe search’ settings on their browsers. Campaigners warned that parents are struggling to keep up with their offspring’s use of technology, meaning they are less able to protect them from online dangers. The statistics support the Daily Mail’s campaign for internet service providers to be forced to block unsafe material, with over-18s able to access adult material only following a strict age check. Alarming: Survey by Ofcom revealed only 43% of parents had installed 'safe searches' on their home computers (file picture) The Government has agreed a compromise solution, under which all new broadband contracts will have filters turned on and existing customers will be prompted to make a decision about their service. Miranda Suit, co-chairman of Safermedia, said yesterday: ‘Ofcom’s figures show the problem of dealing with the internet is still growing. ‘Parents have still not been able to catch up with their children’s technology skills and protect them adequately. ‘Children who use tablets are more easily able to use public wi-fi. Instead of sitting at the family PC they can just go to the local park or café. And lots of public wi-fi is unfiltered, meaning they can access whatever they want.’ She said she recognised the problems faced by parents. ‘The way children access the internet is getting more complex, and more difficult to monitor,’ said Miss Suit. In a survey of 2,374 parents, Ofcom found that 64 per cent believed their online safety measures were effective. But half admitted their children knew more about the internet than them. The report also found that children aged 12 to 15 have never met almost a third of the ‘friends’ on social networking sites, opening them to the risk of grooming and bullying. On average, teenagers said they had 272 online friends, but had never met 78 of them. A third allowed their pages to be viewed by strangers, up from 22 per cent last year. The Ofcom report warned: ‘Children with a social networking site profile that may be visible to people not known to them are more likely to have undertaken some kind of potentially risky online behaviour, such as adding people to their contacts they don’t know in person, or sending them photos or personal details.’","Ofcom reveals 42% of children are using tablets, up from 14% last year .

Bestselling author Tom Clancy has died at the age of 66 in his birth town of Baltimore, Maryland at one of the country's leading cancer hospitals. Clancy wrote espionage and military thrillers including 'The Hunt for Red October,' 'Patriot Games,' 'Clear and Present Danger' and 'The Sum of All Fears.' Those four books were all turned into successful blockbuster films starring actors Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, and Ben Affleck. Another film based on his desk-jockey CIA hero, 'Jack Ryan,' is set for release later this year, while his next book, 'Command Authority,' is set to be published on December 3. John Hopkins, the hospital where he died also featured in many times in his books along with a number of characters that worked as doctors, nurses or were patched up there. Tom Clancy died last night at age 66 in Baltimore, Maryland October 2, 2013. He's pictured (left) in 2002 . Clancy and his first wife, Wanda, married in 1969. They divorced 30 years later. He's pictured here in 1997 . During his lifetime, Clancy made gifts to Johns Hopkins totaling more than  $2 million and funded a professorship in ophthalmology at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Clancy's donation to the hospital created a legacy that will benefit generations to come. Clancy was a long-time supporter of the Wilmer Eye Institute and even included Wilmer in his books: Cathy Ryan, wife of Clancy's fictional hero Jack Ryan, is a surgeon at Wilmer. The cause of his death is not yet known. The Baltimore Sun reported that Clancy died Tuesday at Johns Hopkins Hospital after a 'brief illness.' The New York Times first reported news of Clancy's death. John Hopkins hospital, Baltimore: Clancy gave a donation of more than $2 million dollars during his lifetime and also featured many characters in his novels that either worked or passed through the hospital . Tom Clancy is pictured at his wedding to freelance journalist Alexandra Marie Llewellyn in New York in 1999 . Seventeen of his novels ranked No. 1 on the New York Times best-sellers list, . including his most recent, 'Threat Vector,' which was released in . December 2012. He . first arrived on best-seller lists in 1984 with 'The Hunt for Red . October.' He sold the manuscript to the first publisher he tried, the . Naval Institute Press, which had never bought original fiction. Clancy . had said his dream had been simply to publish a book, hopefully a good . one, so that he would be in the Library of Congress catalog. Tom Clancy poses with a copy of his novel 'The Teeth of the Tiger' during the book's presentation at Barnes and Nobles Books on Fifth Avenue in New York City in 2003 . Born in Baltimore on April 12, 1947 to a mailman and his wife, Clancy entered Loyola College as a physics major, but switched to English as a sophomore, saying later that he wasn't smart enough for the rigors of science. Ironically, his novels carried stiff doses of scientific data and military detail. After graduation in 1969, he married his college sweetheart Wanda and joined her family's insurance business, all the while scribbling down ideas for a novel. They divorced 30 years later. The novelist went on to marry freelance journalist Alexandra Marie Llewellyn. Wanda Clancy told MailOnline in a phone interview that she'd kept a distance from her ex when he passed away saying, 'No, I wasn't there.' In 1979, Clancy began 'Patriot Games,' in which he invented his hero, CIA agent Jack Ryan. In 1982, he put it aside and started 'The Hunt For Red October,' basing it on a real incident in November 1979, in which a Soviet missile frigate called the Storozhevoy attempted to defect. In real life, the ship didn't make it, but in Clancy's book, the defection is a success. This is a screen grab from 'The Sum of All Fears' starring Morgan Freeman (left) pictured as DCI William Cabot, with Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan, in a scene from the film based on the novel, of the same title, by Tom Clancy . By a stroke of luck, President Reagan got 'Red October' as a Christmas gift and quipped at a dinner that he was losing sleep because he couldn't put the book down — a statement Clancy later said helped put him on the New York Times best-seller list. It led to a string of hits, both on the page and in Hollywood blockbusters. He even ventured into video games with the best-selling 'Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier,' ''Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction' and 'Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent.' The latest Jack Ryan movie, directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Chris Pine, is set for release in the U.S. on Christmas Day. Keira Knightly plays Jack Ryan's wife and Kevin Costner plays his mentor at the CIA. Clancy resided in rural Calvert County, Md., and in 1993 he joined a group of investors led by Baltimore attorney Peter Angelos who bought the Baltimore Orioles from businessman Eli Jacobs. Clancy also attempted to bring a NFL team to Baltimore in 1993, but he later dropped out of the effort. Novels by Tom Clancy .

A mother who lost her looks and was given an Asbo after a five-month raucous drinking binge at her house has admitted that alcohol has ruined her life. Rebecca Proctor, 28, who blames her transformation from fresh-faced young woman into haggard neighbour from hell on heavy drinking after her father died from a heart attack, says it has cost more than her looks. Today the mother of one said she had lost her only son as well as her home in Burnley, Lancashire, as a result of her two-bottles-a-night bingeing, and vowed to change her life for the better. Proctor, a former factory worker who is now sleeping on friends' sofas, said: 'I've lost everything and it's down to my drinking.' Contrast: Rebecca Proctor went from a fresh-faced young mother, left, to a haggard drunk, right, in just five months after embarking on a non-stop binge . Rowdy: The 28-year-old held raucous parties at her home which lasted up to five days, according to neighbours . She said she had sought help to . tackle her drinking problem and told the Sun: 'I want to get my son back . and get myself a part-time job.  That is what hurts me the most because . I love him so much.' Drinks company Lambrini, manufacturers of Proctor's favourite perry, said: 'There appear to be many issues and factors contributing . to Ms Proctor's case. We always recommend that alcohol is consumed . responsibly within the daily unit guidelines. The firm said Lambrini was not solely responsible for Proctor's problems, saying that she consumed a wide range of alcoholic drinks, of which Lambrini was just one. Proctor, who was given an antisocial behaviour order (Asbo) last month and barred from her regular haunts including shopping centres, was evicted from her terraced house after neighbours complained that she held all-night parties. But today she insisted she hadn't . been partying but simply watching soap operas and drinking with her . boyfriend and another friend. She also said the police mugshot . which showed the shocking toll alcohol had taken on her previously . youthful looks had actually been taken a year earlier when she was the . victim of domestic violence. If Proctor, a mother of one, returns to her old house and causes further distress to neighbours she could be jailed for up to five years. Before: Proctor, a mother of one son, looks happy and pretty in pictures taken by friends earlier this year . After: She became addicted to drinking Lambrini and other types of alcohol during her binge sessions . Reedley Magistrates' Court in Burnley imposed the . order after hearing that she was 'repeatedly responsible for causing . noise nuisance and displaying drunk and disorderly behaviour'. Proctor's former neighbours welcomed the decision to evict her from the area, describing how she would keep them awake with parties which went on for up to five days at a time. One said: 'It's an absolute total relief to the neighbourhood that she's gone, and it's fair to say we've had our first peaceful night's sleep in ages. 'Rebecca was nothing but a drunk and a terrible drunk at that. She may look as though butter would not melt in some of her pictures but the reality was she was nothing but trouble. 'She would have three or four blokes around every weekend and they would be sat there drinking for England and taking drugs. It was disgusting. 'When she first moved in she was alright and I tried to help her. I even mended her child's bike and helped her out with odd jobs. But then she lost it and her true colours shone through ever since. Kicked out: Proctor has been forced to leave her terraced house in Burnley after being handed an Asbo . 'Sadly it was the drink which took over her life and she's been a constant source of problems round her. It was parties every weekend and we couldn't sleep. It would just be noise from them shouting more than noise from music. 'Sometimes it was just a couple of them, and sometimes it was four or five people and they would be out here in front of our house and in the street drinking and taking drugs. 'Sometimes she would be downstairs with people having a party when her child was upstairs. It was nightmare living next door to her.' The 52-year-old woman, who gave evidence at Proctor's Asbo hearing, added: 'Sometimes parties would go on from Thursday until Monday. They would sleep in the day when we're at work and in the night be all shouting and drinking. 'I believe she is seeking treatment for her alcohol abuse and she says she has managed to curb her drinking - but only from two bottles of Lambrini a day to one and a half.' Natalie Whittaker from Lancashire Police said after the case: 'This Asbo is an excellent result for local residents who were being kept up until all hours because of noise and excessive drinking by Rebecca Proctor. 'They had really had enough and I hope that this result will enable them to sleep without disruption. 'I hope this sends out a clear message that police and other agencies will not tolerate this type of behaviour and will take firm action against those involved in anti-social behaviour.'","Rebecca Proctor, 28, went on five-month drinking binge earlier this year .

Medicine: Experts claim heather honey could offer a cheaper alternative than the health product from New Zealand . Scottish honey may be as effective as more expensive manuka when it comes to beating bacteria, a study has shown. Experts claim heather honey could offer a cheaper alternative to manuka, from New Zealand, which is already known for its medicinal qualities. Honey’s anti-bacterial properties are widely used in veterinary medicine as a wound dressing. The findings come from a study published in The Veterinary Journal and carried out by Dr Patrick Pollock and colleagues at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Glasgow. Of 11 different honeys tested, heather honey from the Inverness area was particularly effective, killing MRSA microbes and three other types of bacteria. Dr Pollock, a bee keeper, said: ‘While manuka is currently the only medical grade honey, the study reveals other honeys may be just as suitable. ‘Consequently, it may prove unnecessary to transport manuka honey from New Zealand when more local sources may be as, or even more, effective.’ Honeys largely get their anti-microbial properties from the hydrogen peroxide they contain. Manuka is thought to benefit from a phytochemical property and a methylglyoxal compound. Heather honey costs an average of £1.90 for 100g while 100g of manuka is £4.71. Dr Pollock said: 'Although manuka has been the most studied honey source to date, other honey sources may have valuable antimicrobial properties too. 'Honey is useful in equine medicine, particularly on wounds to legs. There is not much fat on the lower half of horses' legs, so can take a long time to heal, or even never fully heal at all. Effective: Manuka is currently the only medicinal grade honey available, but other types may also be suitable (file picture) 'Honey helps to promote healing, cleaning the wound and keeping it infection free. If vets were able to use locally-sourced, cheaper honey as a wound dressing, it would be very beneficial particularly in poorer countries.' The researchers took 29 honey products, including commercial medical grade honeys, supermarket honeys and honeys from local bee-keepers, and examined them for bacterial contamination before testing. Eighteen were found to contain bacteria that excluded them from the trial and the remaining 11 were tested against 10 equine bacterial isolates at concentrations varying from two per cent to 16 per cent. Eight of the honeys were effective against all the bacteria at concentrations ranging from two per cent to six per cent.","Experts say it could be a cheaper alternative to the New Zealand product .

It also wants his caretaker license confiscated and to obtain the cats. Borges appealed and the matter is pending before a federal court. The agency declined repeated requests for comment. Ary's daughter Nayara Borges, 20, who grew up with the tiger cubs sleeping in her bed until they became too big, says she thinks the big cats would be mistreated if taken away, 'and our family would go into a severe depression.' Her sister Uyara, 23, agreed, saying the cats are family after spending so many years with the Borges. 'At first we were scared of them, but as time went on, we saw them every day, fed them, gave them baths and water, and we started to fall in love with them,' Uyara said. 'We never thought we could live with such ferocious animals.' A handler holds out a piece of meat for Tom: Brazilian authorities also want his caretaker license confiscated and to obtain the cats .

Uyara trusts the cats so much, she even allows her two-year-old daughter Rayara to sit atop them. Experts, however, question the Borges family's efforts. 'It's crazy,' said Patty Finch, executive director of the Washington-based Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries. 'It's a very dangerous situation, especially if there are young children around, they easily trigger a tiger's hunting instinct.' Finch said that 'you will see people sometimes get lucky for a while, but sooner or later an accident is going to happen. You never know what's going to set these animals off because they're wild.' Tom takes a swim: One animal welfare campaigner says, 'people sometimes get lucky for a while, but sooner or later an accident is going to happen... because they are wild' Pounce: Campaigners say breeding in captivity doesn't help conserve the tigers unless they're bred in their native habitat and there is a plan to release them . Instead of promoting the animal's welfare, Finch said the Borges have done the opposite. 'Breeding in captivity doesn't help conserve the tigers unless they're bred in their native habitat and there is a plan to release them,' she said. 'They can't get habituated to people.

London's flood defence system was activated yesterday for the first time since 2010 as Britain's wet weather threatens to bring flooding to the capital. The Environment Agency raised the Thames Barrier yesterday morning to prevent flooding from the current tides as extra rainfall, which has fallen further up the River Thames, flows downstream. It came as forecasters warned yet more downpours and storms are on the way to bring a soggy end to the wettest year in England since records began in 1910. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

'When the jet stream moves up to the north, and then travels back down to the UK, it brings with it cold air, blizzards, very severe and unpleasant weather from that perspective,' he said. Professor Palmer predicted Britain will see more extreme patterns of weather with periods of drought followed by flooding and cold weather as the jet stream continues to be affected by climate change. 'The question of how it will change is still a very active research problem, and we don't have clear-cut answers yet. 'But I think there is quite a big possibility that what we will see is the jet stream undergoing quite dramatic and erratic excursions.'

A 71-year-old man who spent 41 years in solitary confinement died today, just days after being freed. Herman Wallace, who had liver cancer, died at a supporter's home in New Orleans, his attorneys said. 'One of the final things that Herman said to us was, ""I am free. I am . free"",' they said. Before he was released from prison on Tuesday and granted a new trial, Wallace had been at a prison hospital. Jackie Sumell, a longtime supporter of Wallace, said he was surrounded by friends and family when he died. At one point Wallace told them, 'I love you all,' she said, adding that he was 'in and out of consciousness'. Baton Rouge Judge Brian Jackson had ordered Wallace released from prison on Tuesday after granting him a new trial. Jackson ruled women were unconstitutionally excluded from the grand jury that indicted Wallace in the fatal stabbing of 23-year-old prison guard Brent Miller. A West Feliciana Parish grand jury re-indicted Wallace on charges connected to Miller's death on Thursday. District Attorney Sam D'Aquilla told The Advocate newspaper that Jackson ordered a new trial because he 'perceived a flaw in the indictment - not his murder conviction'. Wallace and two other inmates held in solitary confinement for years came to be known as the 'Angola 3'. When he learned his cancer was terminal, Wallace made a statement on a website dedicated to an art project based around his experiences. He said: 'The State may have stolen my life, but my spirit will continue to struggle along with Albert and the many comrades that have joined us along the way here in the belly of the beast.' His attorneys said in a statement on Friday that it was an honor to represent him. Freedom: Herman Wallace, who had liver cancer, is pictured above being released from prison . Two of the three: Albert Woodfox and Herman Wallace, pictured in prison in 2008, were convicted alongside Robert King who were sentenced for killing a prison guard in 1972 . Behind the gates: Wallace was in solitary confinement at Louisiana's Angola Prison for 41 years . 'Herman endured what very few of us can imagine, and he did it with grace, dignity, and empathy to the end,' they said. 'Although . his freedom was much too brief, it meant the world to Herman to spend . these last three days surrounded by the love of his family and friends.' Parnell Herbert, who wrote a play about the Angola Three, called his friend a 'phenomenal person' whose mission was to help people. 'He completed that mission. And he was able to see himself a free man,' Mr Herbert told The Times Picayune. The New Orleans man was serving a 50-year armed robbery sentence when Mr Miller was stabbed to death. Wallace . and fellow 'Angola 3' member Albert Woodfox denied being involved, . claiming they were targeted because they helped establish a prison . chapter of the Black Panther Party at the Angola prison in 1971, where . they set up demonstrations and organized strikes for better conditions. In 2010, Woodfox was moved to the David Wade Correctional Center in Homer, where he remains in custody. The . third 'Angola 3' member, Robert King, who was convicted of killing a . fellow inmate in 1973, was released in 2001 after his conviction was . reversed.

Connected: Robert Hillary King, left, spent 29 years in solitary before being released in 2001 and Albert Woodfox, right, remains in prison and has spent 40 years in solitary . 'The record in . this case makes clear that Mr Wallace's grand jury was improperly . chosen in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of ""the . equal protection of the laws"" ... and that the Louisiana courts, when . presented with the opportunity to correct this error, failed to do so,' Judge Jackson wrote. A lawyer for Wallace said the decision gives his client 'some measure of justice after a lifetime of injustice'. Amnesty International delivered a petition to Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal's office last year, containing 65,000 signatures from people around the world who called the men's solitary confinement inhuman and degrading.","Herman Wallace was freed on Tuesday after being jailed since 1971 .

German Chancellor Angela Merkel won an historic third term in power this evening - making her the only European leader not to become a casualty of Europe’s financial crisis. Official results have now confirmed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives won Germany's election with 41.5 per cent of the vote but indicate that they have finished short of an absolute majority. Its coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats, slumped to 4.8 percent - not enough to win seats. Challenger Peer Steinbrueck's Social Democrats won 25.7 percent, their Green allies 8.4 percent and the hard-line Left Party 8.6 percent. The likeliest outcome for coalition is with the Social Democrats. Win: Chancellor and leader of Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Angela Merkel has won a third term in office . Victory: General Secretary Hermann Groehe congratulates the Chancellor after exit polls broadcast on German television showed Merkel's Christian Democratic Union had won 42 per cent of the vote . All smiles: Merkel told her supporters this evening that the result was 'super' and that they should 'celebrate' Exit poll figures released on German television shows the CDU and CSU have won 42.5 per cent of the vote . Speaking earlier this evening, the Chancellor, 59, said . it was too early to discuss plans for the next government. Merkel said: 'I see the next four years in front of me and I can promise that we will face many tasks, at home, in Europe and in the world. 'We will do all we can in the next four years together to make them successful years for Germany. 'It is too early to say how we will proceed but today we should celebrate.' The result is an improvement of more than eight points on the last election in 2009. The Union's strong showing was also personal victory for Merkel, who has held the position since 2005, solidifying her position as arguably Europe's strongest political leader. Victory . at the polls was tempered by a disastrous showing from the liberal Free . Democratic Party (FDP) - Merkel's current junior coalition party - . which only won 4.8 per cent of the vote. It means they cannot rule for a second term in power with the incumbent Chancellor. The result could see the center-right party face an embarrassing ejection from parliament also. The exit polls were greeted by shocked silence by the Free Democrats' at their election event. Four years ago, the party won nearly 15 percent of the vote, its best-ever result - but the party has taken much of the blame for squabbling in Merkel's governing coalition since then. Joy: Supporters of Merkel's party celebrate at CDU headquarters as the first exit polls are published . Merkel's supporters were elated at the result, which sees the Chancellor remain in power for a third term . 'It's the bitterest, saddest hour of the Free Democratic Party,' the party's leader, Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler, said. The Chancellor will now . most likely join with the centre-left Social Democratic . Party (SPD) – the equivalent to the British Labour party - which is . opposed to many of her conservative principles and policies. Peer Steinbrueck, leader of the SPD, came in second place on around 26 percent. Speaking this evening, Peer Steinbrueck said: 'We did not achieve the result we wanted. 'The ball is in Merkel's court. She has to get herself a majority.' According to media reports, SPD leader . Peer Steinbrueck was already resigned to being Mrs. Merkel’s understudy . for the next four years as the junior partner in a coalition before . voting started today. Good result: Merkel's supporters continued to celebrate after the result was announced . Merkel's CDU was favourite to win the election, following an upbeat campaign focusing on the party's successes over the past two terms . The SPD was Merkel's coaltion partner in her first term. Both . parties are committed to saving the euro and to the . 'Mittelstand' - small-to-medium-sized businesses that form the backbone . of the export led economy. However, the SPD is a party of higher . taxes, minimum wages and workers' rights, limited military involvement . abroad and a host of neo-liberal family policies certain to rub against . Mrs. Merkel's avowed intent to carry on down the path of austerity. Manfred . Guellner, managing director of the pollster Forsa said: 'There are many . within the SPD who oppose the idea of going into a grand coalition with . Merkel’s bloc.' He added that many want assurances they will not merely be Angela”s 'Mummy's Boys' at her beck and call for the next four years. Bad news: Free Democrat (FDP) supporters looked stunned as it is announced their party will no longer be in coalition with the CDU after winning just 4.5 per cent of the vote . Second place: Social Democratic (SPD) party candidate Peer Steinbrueck waves to supporters after learning his party came second with 26 per cent of the vote. He is most likely to enter into coalition with Merkel . Supporters of the Social Democratic Party celebrate winning 26 per cent of the vote . Elsewhere, the Alternative for Deutschland party – . which is opposed to the euro – scored just four percent, a whole . per cent less than the total needed to get into parliament. The . hard-left Linke Pary won five percent, and the Greens scored nine . percent, but neither have enough votes to form a government with the . SPD. There was a poor . showing for the NPS neo-Nazi party which also failed to gain enough . votes to get into parliament for the first time. Early indications pointed to a higher . turnout than four years ago, election officials said - with 41.4 per . cent of eligible voters casting their ballots by 2pm, four hours before . polling stations closed. That compared with 36.1 per cent at the same . point in 2009. Leaders of Die Linke Bernd Riexinger and Katja Kipping at the exit poll announcement this evening . Results: Supporters of the left-wing ""Die Linke"", who received 5 per cent of the vote, gather for the exit poll announcement at the party headquarters this evening . The . coming hours and days will see a frantic round of negotiations between . the CDU and the SPD as they carve up ministries and posts to satisfy all . sides in their respective parties. After . leading Germany through the economic crisis, Mrs. Merkel went into the . race for power more popular than ever - portraying herself as a safe . pair of hands as the crisis claimed leaders in France, Greece, Italy and . Spain. Pre-polls gave Merkel popularity ratings of . about 70 per cent. Supporters of the German Green Party celebrate the result at the party headquarters . Before voting today, Merkel called her current coalition 'the . most successful government since reunification' 23 years ago. She pointed to the robust economy and unemployment which, at 6.8 per cent, is very . low for Germany and far below that of many other European countries. Germany's first post-war chancellor, conservative Konrad Adenauer, won the only single-party majority so far in 1957.

A gang of robbers, who killed one of their victims when they pushed him into a Manchester canal and left him to drown, have been jailed today. Simon Brass, 40, was heard to twice shout 'I can’t swim' but three of the gang of five assailants calmly walked away and one later explained he did not help because he 'wasn’t getting wet'. The youngest member of the group of thugs, who were trying to steal Mr Brass's mobile phone, was just 14 at the time of the incident. Jailed: Paul Creedy, 20, left, and Kieron Murray, 22, right, were sentenced to 10 years in prison for their part in the death of Simon Brass who was pushed into a Manchester canal and left to drown after a failed robbery . Paul Creedy, 20, Kieron Murray, 22, and Leah Garner, 21, were old jailed for 10 years at Manchester Crown Court today. Jack Smith, 19, will serve nine years in a young offender's institute. The boy, who is now 15 and cannot be named for legal reasons, was sentenced to five years and eight months in a young offender's institute. All had pleaded guilty to manslaughter at previous hearings. Sentencing, Judge Clement Goldstone QC . said: 'Simon Brass was pushed into the canal when efforts to rob him . proved unsuccessful and who you left to die, knowing he could not swim. 'This was not wanton hooliganism or a prank gone wrong. He was the intended victim of a robbery.' The court had heard that Mr Brass had been targeted in a known spot for 'cruising' around the towpaths near to Manchester’s Canal Street gay village. The hearing was told that the 'dark, dangerous' surrounding underpasses were frequented by gay men who looked for casual sexual encounters and who in turn were preyed upon by robbers who were aware their victims would be unlikely to complain to the police. Sentenced: Jack Smith, left, will spend the next nine years in a young offender's institute, while Leah Garner, right, was jailed for 10 years . Earlier in the night another victim had been robbed and a good Samaritan who came to his aid was pushed in the canal before the group turned their attention to Mr Brass. The body of Mr Brass, from Salford and originally from the Newcastle area, was recovered four days later from the canal. All members of the gang had varying roles in a series of four robberies that took place on the towpath of the Rochdale Canal in the early hours of June 5 last year, said prosecutor Mark Kellet. 'The fact that Mr Brass had hidden his phone clearly frustrated the five defendants in their attempt to rob him.' Prosecutor Mark Kellet . Creedy and Murray approached the first victim at about 1.10am and pretended to be police officers looking for drugs as they searched his pockets and took a packet of cigarettes. Three men came to his assistance but Creedy and Murray turned on two of them. They repeatedly stamped on the head of one and pushed the other into the canal. Creedy attempted to kick one of the Samaritan’s hands from the edge of the bank as he struggled to get out before the other defendants joined in pursuing him on foot where eventually the man fell to the floor and was kicked unconscious. The five defendants left the scene but returned about 90 minutes later where they came across Mr Brass. Mr Kellet said: 'Exactly what happened that led to the death of Simon Brass is not clear. However the Crown says that it can be properly inferred that he was thrown or pushed into the canal. Gay scene: Mr Brass was killed at a notorious 'cruising' spot close to Manchester's Canal Street, pictured . 'When Simon Brass’s body was recovered his iPhone was found in his sock. 'He was clearly alert to the fact that men looking for sexual encounters at the canal locks are frequently robbed of their mobile telephones. 'The fact that he had hidden his phone clearly frustrated the five defendants in their attempt to rob him.' 'This was not wanton hooliganism or a prank gone wrong. Mr Brass was the intended victim of a robbery.' Judge Clement Goldstone QC . Barely two minutes later along the towpath, another man was robbed of his mobile phone by Creedy, Murray and the 15-year-old. They were arrested shortly afterwards when they attempted to sell the phone in two nearby takeaways. Following those arrests, CCTV footage was studied which led to the arrests of Garner and Smith. Creedy and Murray, each received 10-year sentences and will be on extended licence for three years on release. Garner, was also jailed for 10 years and Smith, will serve nine years in a Young Offenders Institute. The youth was detained for five years and eight months. Judge Goldstone commented that Smith’s comment to a friend about not 'getting wet' was 'callous in the extreme'. Hearing: All five members of the gang were jailed at Manchester Crown Court . In a statement issued after sentencing, Detective Sergeant Derek Houston said: 'Mr Brass’s life was tragically cut short when this group decided he was the perfect target for a robbery. 'Not at one point did they consider his safety having failed to steal anything from him they pushed him into the canal and the actions they took were reckless. 'Mr Brass’s family have been left with a gap in their lives that will never be filled. 'They will have to live with the fact that their time together was cut drastically short thanks to the selfish act of five callous individuals. 'This has been a painstaking investigation that involved over 1,000 hours of CCTV being studied from over 100 cameras and the smallest of details being analysed. 'I hope Mr Brass’s family and friends can take some comfort knowing that the people responsible for his untimely death are now being punished for what they did.' Members of the victim’s family attended today’s sentencing. In a victim impact statement read out in the court they said they had all 'suffered from this tragedy'. Both the health of Mr Brass’s father, Richard, and stepmother, Hilda, had deteriorated since his death, the court heard. The statement continued: 'As a family we are all very close. Simon was a vital link. He regularly returned home for family events and holidays.'","Simon Brass drowned after being pushed into the water close to Manchester's Canal Street .

Andy Burnham has begun legal proceedings after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed he tried to ‘cover up’ NHS failings. Labour’s health spokesman called in lawyers after allegations that while he was in power he attempted to suppress a report that exposed devastating lapses in hospital care. A party spokesman said Mr Burnham would not tolerate ‘slurs on his character’ and warned that formal legal action could follow – an extremely unusual step for high-profile politicians. Threat: Andy Burnham brought in Labour’s lawyers after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt refused to retract an allegation that his Opposition shadow was involved the suppression of a critical report into 'failing' hospitals . Mr Hunt has refused to retract the . comments he made on Twitter and last night refused to back down, . releasing more evidence which he believes will undermine Mr Burnham’s . claims. He insisted there . was still a ‘clear link’ between political pressure by Labour ministers . while Mr Burnham was running the NHS and the failure to expose high . death rates by health watchdog the Care Quality Commission. Labour yesterday said Mr Hunt’s tweet had gone ‘a step too far’ and followed a long smear campaign. ‘This . is behaviour unbecoming of a secretary of state,’ said a spokesman. ‘Andy Burnham is not prepared to accept these unfounded slurs on his . character and the last government. He has therefore instructed lawyers . to act on his behalf.’ The . row erupted after emails were released under the Freedom of Information . Act showing how Labour health ministers tried to stop details emerging . of higher-than-normal death rates at Basildon and Thurrock University . Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Mr Burnham was recorded as being . ‘furious’ when the news leaked in November 2009, months before the . general election. Row: Bitter exchanges were sparked by the release of emails showing the Department of Health under Labour tried to stop details emerging of a hospital scandal involving higher-than-normal death rates (file picture) Communications . showed the Department of Health ordered the CQC not to brief the press . on an inspector’s report into the trust, which found appalling standards . of hygiene with blood on the curtains and chairs. But by then the CQC . had already told three national newspapers. Mr . Hunt seized on the emails last Friday and took to Twitter to denounce . his Labour shadow. ‘Shocking revelations on Andy Burnham’s attempts to . cover up failing hospitals,’ he wrote. Mr . Burnham hit back, insisting the emails showed only that he was . concerned that Department of Health and CQC disclosure rules had been . broken and that he ‘ordered a press release’ after the story broke. However, . allies of Mr Hunt say that Mr Burnham’s anger was not confined to the . timing of the report and was more concerned with the political damage . the revelations could do to Labour. Revelation: The emails, released by the Care Quality Commission watchdog following a request by Tory MP Steve Barclay, relate to Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (file picture) A . letter from Baroness Young, former chairman of the CQC, reveals that he . had taken issue with the tone of the press release. ‘It would be . unfortunate if the CQC were to be judged on the timing or tone of one . press release,’ she said.

A . spokeswoman for Mr Hunt called for Mr Burnham to apologise. Julie Bailey . of campaign group Cure the NHS said the evidence of politically . influenced cover-ups was ‘undeniable’ and said Mr Burnham should stop . ‘focusing on saving his own skin’. Prof .

Ian Abrahams, 62, a Bristol magistrate who proposed scrapping the oath, said: ‘More and more I see people shrug their shoulders or say “whatever” when asked to take it. ‘I’m suggesting we take holy books out of the process. Instead, people will have to show they understand they could be sent to prison if they don’t tell the truth. 'I don’t intend my motion to make any comment on religion. It is certainly not anti-religious.’ There is already an option for non-believers to take a secular oath, while those of other faiths can swear on their own holy texts. But church leaders warned that the measure would be seen as eroding the country’s Christian foundations. The . Rt Rev Michael Nazir-Ali, former Bishop of Rochester, said: ‘This could . be the slippery slope towards the increasing secularisation of society. Where will it end – with the Coronation Oath? ‘The . Bible is bound up with the constitution, institutions and history of . this country. It is right for people to have a choice of oath, a . religious or non-religious one. ‘But we are being urged, in the name of tolerance and secularisation, to restrict that choice.’ Significant: The Rt Rev Michael Nazir-Ali, a former Bishop of Rochester, said the Bible is bound up with the institutions of Britain . The . Rev Arun Arora, director of communications for the Church of England, . added: ‘Given that the last census showed almost 60 per cent of . respondents self-identified as Christians and two thirds as people of . faith, this proposal seems to ignore the statistical reality that we . remain a faithful nation. ‘This kind of proposal seems driven more by blinkered campaigning agendas than abiding interests in justice and truth.’ John Glen, Tory MP for Salisbury and a magistrate until last year, said: ‘This smacks of political correctness gone mad.’ Legal expert Lord Carlile said: ‘It would be unacceptable for the choice to take a religious oath to be removed.’ For . hundreds of years Christian witnesses have been required to hold the . Bible and state: ‘I swear by almighty God that I shall tell the truth, . the whole truth and nothing but the truth.’ Followers . of other faiths are given copies of their sacred texts with, for . example, Muslims swearing on the Koran and Jews on the Old Testament. Under . Mr Abrahams’ proposal, the holy books would be removed and the oath . would read: ‘I promise very sincerely to tell the truth, the whole truth . and nothing but the truth and I understand that if I fail to do so I . will be committing an offence for which I will be punished and may be . sent to prison.’ A Ministry . of Justice spokesman said: ‘We have no plans to change the arrangements . for swearing an oath or making an affirmation in court, which have . worked well for many years and still do.’","The body could scrap the ancient tradition in favour of a new promise .

The advice from Autumnwatch presenter Chris Packham appears to fly in the face of claims that feeding the predators makes them more of a nuisance. He also claimed that reports about foxes attacking humans, going up the stairs in houses and allowing themselves to be picked up were highly unlikely. Claims: TV wildlife expert Chris Packham has said that urban foxes can be fed . Speaking ahead of the new BBC series of Autumnwatch, he warned against ‘demonising’ the animals, pointing out that urban foxes were responsible for far fewer attacks than domestic dogs. The 52-year-old said stories about foxes were often exaggerated due to a lack of understanding, and he warned against creating a fear of foxes. He added: ‘Reports have previously suggested foxes would do things that would be very alien. ‘For example going upstairs, allowing people to pick them up and throw them into the garden. That seems improbable to me.’ There are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the UK, and Mr Packham said it was easy for people to live alongside them and watch them from their homes. But he warned against feeding them too often – saying they should only be fed every now and again. He added: ‘A lot of people like to feed foxes in their back gardens, to see one of the world’s most beautiful animals from their home. Bin bandit: Urban foxes thrive where food is discarded and are quick to rip open bin bags to feed . 'It’s about feeding them sporadically, not regularly, which can create dependence. ‘There are ways we can simply and positively treat these animals. 'We will look at how we can live more harmoniously with them, which can only come from better understanding of their habits.’ Mr Packham will follow the  lives of two urban fox families in Autumnwatch, which starts on October 29 on BBC2, working with the University of Brighton to show how they can coexist with humans. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he said he wanted to discourage people from feeding foxes by hand or every day as they would start to associate humans with food. Last year he said the reason why there were so many foxes was because humans in the West threw away so much food while half the world went hungry. He added: ‘And the reason there are so many? ‘Because while half the world sleeps hungry, we waste enough food to feed them all. ‘Foxes brilliantly betray a national shame, that we’re  wasters and I don’t suppose we like that.’","Chris Packham's advice flies in the face of claims that feeding foxes makes them more of a nuisance .

Shares in the Royal Mail are set to soar in value, thanks to an overwhelming number of applications to buy stock in the company ahead of its privatisation. Stockbrokers have announced that they will stay open over the weekend to cope with last-minute orders ahead of Tuesday’s application deadline. The shares are expected to be valued at 330p each – and city analysts said the price could rise to as high as 450p. Sell-off: Around 30 per cent of the shares on offer are expected to go to members of the public . The Royal Mail sale has attracted . strong demand, with potential investors placing orders for all the . shares within hours of its launch last week. Market commentator David Buik at Panmure Gordon said: ‘It appears to be heavily oversubscribed. ‘Expectations are that Goldman will price the issue at the top end of the range at 330p due to heavy demand.’ Joe . Rundle, from trading firm ETX, said: ‘We have experienced high levels . of demand from retail clients trying to get a piece of the action.’ A spokeswoman for Royal Mail declined to comment on the media report about the price. But if it comes in at the higher end, this points to a bigger annual dividend payout for income-hungry buyers of the shares. The Royal Mail sale has attracted strong demand, with potential investors placing orders for all the shares within hours of its launch last week. Royal Mail's implied dividend yield . for the year ending March 31, 2014 is calculated at between 6.1 per cent . and 7.7 per cent on the basis of the expected offer price range of . between 260p and 330p per share and a notional full-year dividend of . £200million in that financial year. Order books are due to close on October 8, with the shares beginning conditional trading in London on October 11. The privatisation of the near 500-year-old company could be one of Britain's most significant since John Major's Conservative government sold the railways in the 1990s. It would give Royal Mail access to the private capital it says it needs to modernise and to compete in a thriving parcels market. The government has said around 30 per cent of the shares on offer are expected to go to individual members of the public, who must spend a minimum of £750 to invest in the company. Britain has also agreed to hand 10 per cent of Royal Mail's shares to staff in the largest share giveaway of any major UK privatisation. If distributed equally among the eligible 150,000 UK-based workers, each could receive £2,200 worth. The sale has been criticised by the Labour party and by unions, which are balloting for strike action. However, the ballot will close after Royal Mail is due to make its market debut.

Research carried out by food magazine Olive found that although the spicy Spanish sausage was unheard of ten years ago, chorizo is a staple part of the diet of 42 per cent of those surveyed. Staples of our diet: Most of us had never heard of chorizo or prosecco just a decade ago, but now most of us can't live without them . A further 35 per cent said they can't live without a bottle of sweet chilli sauce alongside the ketchup and mayo with almost a quarter rating a bottle of prosecco as a 'must have' in the wine rack. The survey also found a change at the top in terms of who the nation rates as its favourite celebrity chef. A fifth now favour Nigel Slater, with the Hairy Bikers and Michel Roux Jnr also proving popular with foodies. But our favourite television chefs from a decade ago have declined in popularity. Delia Smith, who topped a similar poll compiled by the magazine in 2003, gained just seven per cent of the vote this time around. Faring little better were Nigella Lawson, with just nine per cent of the vote and Jamie Oliver, who polled just 11 per cent. Change in favourites: Nigel Slater, left, is now our favourite celebrity chef according to the poll, whereas 2003 winner Delia Smith, right, has seen her stock reduce . The survey also found that more than half of us are cooking from scratch more often than we were 10 years ago but, perhaps due to the recession hitting us in the wallets, only a third of us are dining out more. When we do eat out, 40 per cent of us say that chain restaurants are what make us most unhappy about the modern food scene, followed by bad service and the 'prohibitively expensive' cost of eating out. Cupcakes were rated the favourite food trend of the decade with locally produced seasonal food, farmers' markets and 'diverse cuisine' increasing in popularity, no doubt because of the influx of cookery shows on television. Popular: The Hairy Bikers are also well liked among foodies according to the survey . Masterchef: 14 per cent of those surveyed turn to top chef Michel Roux Jnr for culinary inspiration . Olive editor Christine Hayes said: 'In the last decade, we have witnessed a period of profound change in the UK food scene. 'We are far more diverse in our tastes and seek out great value whether cooking at home or eating out at home and abroad. 'Nigel Slater's relaxed cooking style and the seasonal, often home-grown, ingredients he uses chimes with the increased trend of using ingredients when they are at their best.'","Britons also now can't live without sweet chilli sauce and prosecco .

Guilty: City Analyst David Reynolds was fined £3,000 for an attack that left a bouncer with a broken nose . A City analyst who broke a bouncer’s nose in a row over a £500 bar bill at a five-star hotel after claiming he was related to the Queen was spared jail today. Instead David Reynolds, 31, was fined more than £3,000 for his attack on Arza Daery during a row at the Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge, central London, last December following a three-hour drinking binge. The financier launched into a barely comprehensible rant against staff then punched the bouncer after his credit card was declined, City of London Magistrates’ Court heard. Reynolds, of Highbury in North London, had claimed staff had ‘grossly over-reacted’ and that he ‘absolutely did not’ hit the bouncer. But he was convicted of assault after magistrates rejected his version of events. Sentencing Reynolds, chair of the bench, Dr Pete Galloway said: ‘You will not have been the first and you will not be the last person to have been so fuelled by alcohol seven days before Christmas Day that you take a course of action that with hindsight you regret. ‘We have looked very closely at everything that has been said about you. ‘We know that you regret not walking away as would have been highly advisable.’ Dr Galloway said that they had considered all Reynolds' character references, his savings, expenses and his salary. He ordered Reynolds to pay a fine of £1,500 and compensation to the victim of £1,000. Victim: Bouncer Araz Draey (left) had his nose broken by Reynolds. Cleuber Martins (right), Mr Draey's colleague,  who gave evidence at the trial, leaves City of London Magistrates' Court . Reynolds must also pay £600 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. On hearing the ruling, Reynolds, dressed smartly in a blue suit and tie, said: 'Thank you very much, your Honour'. Prosecutor Jonathan Swain said: ‘Mr Reynolds was very drunk and as a result, he was asked to leave by management. Grateful: Reynolds thanked the chair of the bench for sparing him jail . ‘He was escorted from the premises by Mr Daery. ‘While outside, there was an unprovoked assault by Mr Reynolds. He punched Mr Daery in the face. ‘There was no threat of violence by either individual and as a result, a struggle ensued. ‘He was held by two door staff until the police arrived’, Mr Swain added. Giving evidence, Mr Daery said: ‘I was called to the bar and found two gentlemen who were unable to pay for their drinks. ‘I tried to communicate with them, but he [Reynolds] was not responding. He added: 'I was a couple of feet away and Reynolds kept coming back and forth calling the doormen names and calling me a c*** - all kinds of swear words. 'He kept telling me I was going to regret it, calling me a c***. My hands were behind my back and then he hit me. 'It was a punch, he punched me in the face in my nose with a closed fist. It was hard enough to break my nose - I got several fractures.' Cleuber Martins, the second bouncer, told the court Reynolds claimed royal descent. ‘The defendant was talking in French. ‘He was shouting some bad swear words, calling everyone a c***, claiming to be related to the Royal family, saying we were all going to lose our jobs. ‘He kept saying “you deserve it, you’re all c***s, I’m related to the Queen”.’ Reynolds has 21 days to pay the costs.

Graffiti artists are used to hiding while they daub their works on walls as being caught would mean a telling off from the police. But one German street-art duo have taken things a step further and started hiding their artwork as well. Painted on the side of railings and steps, these fantastic images can only be viewed from certain angles, effectively hiding them in plain sight. Zebrating are a German street art duo who have been decorating railings and steps across Europe with their tick-of-the-eye paintings . The wonderful artworks appear mostly in Germany in city such as Hamburg, Berlin and Stuttgart . Speedy: The works are made using spray paint and glue and take just 30 minutes to create . From the right point of view this bridge turns into a stunning portrait of a young woman . The artists behind these human portraits are male and female duo who go by the name 'Zebrating' and are touring German cities with their spray paints in a bid to jazz up boring street railings. 'Everybody can see our art when they're passing by, but the way we've designed it makes it only accessible to the people who walk around with open eyes,' said Zebrating. 'For our art you have to change your point of view, and take a few steps back to see it right.' Much like rotating billboard adverts, the pictures only appear when viewed from a certain angle . Seen from a different point of view the picture slowly disappears and from the reverse angle nothing can be seen . The duo, who go by the name of Zebrating, said they were inspired to do it by the 'boring' railings . The paintings take half an hour to make each so this set of bars represents two and a half hours work . Zebrating have left their mark on various cities such as Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart, and even travelled to Paris in order to try to spread their passion of street art. These masterpieces are made purely from spray paint and paste and only take 30 minutes to create, with the artists working against the clock to leave unseen. 'We had this big idea of what we wanted to do. We both recognised the hidden and still idle places perfect for street art, such as fences and railings. At first glance what might look like ordinary road railings are in fact amazing works of art . The artists use mathematical trigonometry to work out how to divide up their paintings across the railings . Despite several run-ins with the police that hasn't stopped Zebrating artwork from springing up . As well as Germany the creative couple have taken their art abroad to Paris, a city known for its street artists . 'They are always so grey and boring; we wanted to brighten up peoples journeys a bit. To make it happen, we needed a little bit of trigonometry knowledge and the courage to do it.' Another street artist also on tour at the moment is world-renowned pioneer Banksy, who has vowed to put up a new artwork in New York every day until the end of October. The show, entitled Better Out Than In, has seen three works spring up on walls in the city's art district. Like most street artists Zebrating operate under the cloak of anonymity for fear of being caught . Their paintings mostly feature young women but also include male faces and eyeballs . Zebrating say people are confused by their works at first, but when they work out the trick they are always amazed . The latest, a dog urinating on a fire hydrant with a speech bubble which says 'you complete me', has already attracted a huge crowd. Banksy shows are usually public and free for all, though his pieces are often hijacked by collectors who go on to sell them for hundreds of thousands of pounds. The Bristol-born artist has never been identified and, like most graffiti artists including Zebrating, maintains an air of secrecy.

A married policeman who had sex with a domestic violence victim while on duty has been sacked by his force. Jordan Powell, 31, was jailed at Gloucester Crown Court last month after admitting three counts of misconduct. The court heard Powell, a married father of two, was arrested in July last year after sending text messages to three women asking for sex. West Mercia Police said PC Powell had now been dismissed without notice at a special case hearing chaired by chief constable David Shaw. The force’s deputy chief constable, Simon Chesterman, said in a statement issued after the hearing: 'The outcome of this case highlights the serious nature of the deliberate, calculated and predatory conduct involved and should act as a reminder to all officers and staff of the importance of maintaining professional boundaries at work. 'The vast majority of our officers and staff are honest, hard-working individuals who are dedicated to serving our local communities. 'Incidents of this nature have the potential to seriously damage the trust placed in us by those communities.' Powell, from Tipton, West Midlands, was jailed for 15 months after pleading guilty to three charges of misconduct in a public office committed between May and July 2012. Gloucester Crown Court had heard that father-of-two Powell had a 'large sexual appetite', which led him to repeatedly cheat on his wife. The day before Powell was arrested in July last year he sent - as he arrived at work - text messages simultaneously to three women asking for sex. Powell was caught when his own force became suspicious and set a trap using an undercover female officer. The officer, known only as Roxy, pretended to be a victim of domestic violence and rang police in June last year for assistance. Jailed: PC Jordan Powell, who covered up as he arrived at Gloucester Crown Court,was sentenced to 15 months in prison . Powell was dispatched to her home - fitted with covert recording equipment - to investigate her complaint. Within a couple of hours of leaving Roxy’s home in Kidderminster, Powell had sent her flirtatious text messages from his personal mobile phone, the court heard. Powell sent text messages containing kisses and flirtatious comments, asking whether Roxy had a 'smile on that pretty face'. The conversation then became more sexual, prosecutor Sarah Regan said. The PC joined West Mercia Police in October 2004 and received a written warning in 2008 for having an inappropriate relationship with a female victim of crime.","PC Jordan Powell, 31, was jailed for 15 months in September .

A young woman has escaped injury after a hit-and-run driver smashed into her car while she was taking her driving test. The student, who has not been named, was taking her first test in rush-hour traffic when the accident happened. The test was abandoned and police were called. Officers said the collision happened on the roundabout near the Asda supermarket in Bradford Road, Brackenhall, West Yorkshire, at 8.32am on Friday. The student set off on her test at 8.10am but just 12 minutes later the exam was stopped as another motorist rammed into her instructor's car before running off . Holmfirth-based driving instructor Dave Reilly had dropped the student at Huddersfield Test Centre for the first test of the day at 8.10am. She was driving a new automatic Hyundai i20 - which costs £8,695 - bought by Mr Reilly just two weeks ago. Mr Reilly said his student was shocked but unhurt. It is believed the examiner, a woman, suffered slight neck injuries. Mr Reilly said: 'I can’t believe what has happened and I am just glad no one was seriously injured. I was back at the test centre so I don’t know what happened. The new Hyundai i20, which costs £8,695, had been bought by driving instructor Dave Reilly just two weeks before .

But scientists say that British Prime Ministers Tony Blair and the late Lady Thatcher also had something else in common - the use of egotistical language during their respective periods in office. Dubbed Hubris syndrome, it has been suggested that a number of Prime Ministers may have developed the personality disorder - known as Hubris syndrome - while in power. British Prime Ministers Tony Blair and the late Lady Thatcher also had something else in common - the use of egotistical language during their respective periods in office - known as Hubris syndrome . Researchers at St George's, University of London have discovered that this personality change was reflected in both Blair's and Thatcher's use of language. Hubris, say the researchers, is commonly associated with a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one's own competence, accomplishments or capabilities. It is characterised by a pattern of exuberant self-confidence, recklessness and contempt for others, and is most particularly recognised in subjects holding positions of significant power. Fourteen clinical symptoms of Hubris syndrome have been described. People who show at least three of these could be diagnosed with the disorder. Researchers at St George's, University of London, searched for evidence of some of these clinical features in the language used by three British Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and John Major – by examining transcribed samples of spoken language taken from Prime Minister's Questions. David Cameron . They thought that frequent use of certain words or phrases, such as 'sure', 'certain' and 'confident', the first person pronouns 'I' or 'me', references to God or history, might show up during 'hubristic' periods. They found that 'I' and 'me' and the word 'sure' were among the strongest positive correlations over time in Tony Blair's speech. Blair's use of the word 'important' also increased with time. Words and phrases that became more frequent with time in the speeches of Lady Thatcher and Tony Blair also included the phrase 'we shall', while phrases that included the word 'duties' diminished. The authors also found that language became more complex and less predictable during hubristic periods. For example, Lady Thatcher's language becomes more complex at the end of her term of office, when her decisions and judgements were opening deep divisions within her own party. The same happened to Tony Blair's speech during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq. These linguistic patterns were not reflected in the language of John Major. The relative frequency of the word 'we' compared to 'I' was in fact higher throughout the terms of office of both Thatcher and Blair than at any point of Major's premiership. Additionally, the changes over time in words and phrases adopted by both Thatcher and Blair appeared to mirror the time course of hubristic behaviour. Dr Peter Garrard, the lead researcher, from St George's, University of London, said: 'Hubris . syndrome represents a radical change in a person's outlook, style and . attitude after they acquire positions of power or great influence. 'They . become obsessed with their self-image, excessively confident in their . own judgement and dismissive of others, often leading to rash, ill . thought-out decisions. 'In . other words, the acquisition of power can bring about a change in . personality: it is as if power, almost literally ""goes to their head"". 'This work shows us that language can reflect this highly characteristic personality change' The research is published in the journal Cortex.","Hubris is commonly .

A three-year-old girl who has spent her entire life in hospital as a result of a rare condition which means she cannot breathe on her own is preparing to go home for the first time . Maisie Harris suffers from Ondine’s Curse which means her brain forgets to tell her to breathe, a condition which previously made it impossible for her to leave Great Ormond Street Hospital. However, thanks to a new portable ventilator, Maisie will be able to leave the hospital and go home to her family in Gillingham, Kent. Little Miss Sunshine: Maisie Harris, pictured with her parents Rachel Bridger, 23, and Andrew Harris, 26, is set to go home for the first time on Monday after spending all her life in hospital . The . Minnie Mouse fan requires 24-hour ventilator treatment for the rare . condition, which is medically know as congenital central hypoventilation . syndrome (CCHS), which sees her brain fail to send the vital messages . to her lungs and muscles to tell her to breathe. Her . brain fails to send the correct messages telling her to breathe but . Maisie also suffers from malacia of the airways - ‘floppy’ airways that . do not hold their shape properly. Now, . Maisie, who also suffers from malacia of the airways, can look forward . to a future outside of Great Ormond Street and hopefully be able to go . to a normal school in the future. GOSH . staff held a going-home party on Miffy Ward yesterday to celebrate the . little girl’s bravery as Maisie, who celebrates her third birthday this month, gets ready to move out on Monday. Her mother Rachel . Bridger, 23, said: ‘We cannot wait to bring Maisie home and enjoy being a . normal family. It’s felt as though we have been in hospital for a . lifetime. Happy ending: After spending all her life at Great Ormond Street Hospital, staff threw Maisie a leaving party to celebrate her new portable ventilator and to say goodbye . Normal life: Maisie has never played with other children and her parents hope that she will be able to make new friends as she joins a local nursery int heir home town of Gillingham, Kent . ‘Everyone here has become like a second family to us - they know Maisie inside out. ‘She . knows her own mind but she is a really happy little girl. She’s hardly . ever upset. I don’t think it will take her long to get used to playing . with her toys at home and sleeping in her own bed for the first time. ‘Our . friends and family have helped us decorate the house and get it ready . for her. We’ve painted her bedroom cream and we have got some lovely . stick-on stencils for the walls.’ The . new ventilator is intelligent enough to know when she is able to take . her own breaths and when she is likely to have a CCHS episode and . require ventilation. Ms . Bridger, who suffers from a less complex form of CCHS, and Maisie’s . father Andrew Harris, 26, have been fully trained on how to use her . ventilator and will be supported by a team of local carers. The . couple have mostly been living in hospital accommodation ever since . Maisie was transferred to GOSH from Medway Maritime Hospital when she . was three months old. They have taken it in turns to make the hour-and-a-half journey back to their home. As . a result of her condition Maisie, who loves Minnie Mouse and playing . Alphablocks on her father’s iPad, has hardly spent any time with other . children. Her parents now hope she will be able to mix with other youngsters at nursery. Family curse: Maisie's mother Rachel suffers from a less complex form of the condition which has blighted her daughter's life . Mr Harris said: ‘She will have to get used to lots of new faces as she only really sees close family and her nurses. ‘Hopefully she will soon learn to share her toys and play with other children.’ Dr . Colin Wallis, a consultant in respiratory paediatrics at GOSH, is . working with a number of children requiring long-term ventilation, . including Maisie, to allow them to spend more time at home with their . families. He also treated Ms Bridger when she was younger. He . said: ‘Maisie’s situation is quite complex because she has a . combination of different respiratory conditions, but we are hopeful this . new technology will allow her to go home, be with her family and start . enjoying a fuller, more normal life. ‘We . have been working on ways to allow a greater number of long-term . ventilated children to go home - not only because it greatly enhances . their quality of life, but also because it’s much better for their . development. ‘The family . home is the best place for a young child to grow and develop, and Maisie . will now be able to go out and about with her family, make new friends . and experience everything the outside world has to offer.’ Dr Wallis said CCHS can run in families but added: ‘It is incredibly unusual to see two generations affected by it like this. ‘Maisie’s . condition is more severe than her mother’s and is also complicated by . the additional problem of malacia of the airways.’","Maisie Harris, 3, has lived at Great Ormond Street her entire life .

Royal globetrotter Prince Andrew has come under fire after taking his daughter Eugenie to dinner in New York during an official world tour, which has been partly funded by the taxpayer. The prince, nicknamed Air miles Andy for his habit of taking long-haul flights at the public's expense, is currently on the final leg of a three-week, 21,258-mile ‘official’ trip. He took Eugenie, . 23, who has moved to the city . to work for a year for an online auction company, out for dinner at ABC Kitchen on Wednesday night. The palace has insisted that his primary reason for being in New York was to attend a Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Coast Guard and Airmen's Club ball. The Queen’s son, 53, was forced to give up his formal role as a . UK trade ambassador after a string of scandals. He is the only member of the royal family who refuses to publicise . his foreign travel in advance. A spokesman for the Duchess told the Daily Telegraph: 'Their schedules worked so they were both able to be there at the time Eugenie was moving to New York. 'If the Duke was there at the same time it would have have been because he wanted to be there when his daughter was moving away for a year.' The Prince had four days of official engagements while visiting Indonesia and . Vietnam, but also managed a further eight days designated 'private time'. The . first leg of his tour of the Far East was funded in full by taxpayers, . Buckingham Palace admitted last night. A one-way-business class ticket . would cost at least £5,000. In both Tokyo and New York his expenses – . including travel and accommodation – were in part subsidised by a . private defence think tank which has appointed him to its board of . ‘International Advisors’, the Mail has learnt. Founded in 1831 by the . Duke of Wellington, the Royal United Services Institute is a respected . independent, not-for-profit research body offering expert opinion on . defence, security and terrorism. A Buckingham Palace spokesman insisted the remaining cost of the trip were paid for by the Duke Himself. The Palace declined to comment on his meeting with Eugenie describing it as a 'personal matter'. 'Air miles' Andy: The Queen's son, 53, was forced to give up his formal role as a UK trade ambassador after a string of scandals . Andrew flew out of the UK – accompanied by a team of . round-the-clock, publicly-funded police bodyguards – on September 16 to . Jakarta, where he stayed for three days. The visit was, apparently, . designed to promote ‘UK bilateral relations including in trade and . investment, science and innovation as well as education’. He attended . a dinner at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, opened the new British Embassy and . attended a launch of a Government-backed tourism initiative. Palace officials confirmed last night . that this leg of his journey was approved by the Royal Visits Committee . at the request of the Foreign Office, which means that all his travel . costs, hotels and expenses are met by taxpayers out of the Queen’s . Sovereign Grant. One-way business class flights to Jakarta are just under £5,000. His last official engagement was on the evening of September 19, after which Andrew disappeared for a three-day weekend. He then reappeared in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi on September 23 for a two-day stay. Most . notable in a series of engagements, was a high-level RUSI conference . discussing UK-Vietnam defence co-operation and strategic issues in . South-east Asia. Palace officials say the prince covered the cost of . this part of his trip personally. Duties: The Prince attends the Soldiers', Sailors', Marines', Coast Guard & Airmen's Club Ball in New York last night . Buckingham palace has insisted that the stay in New York was paid for by an American . private defence think tank and the Prince himself . His final engagement was on September . 24 – after which the prince apparently took himself off on holiday again . for five days. Again, palace officials have declined to discuss his . movements. Andrew then turned up in Tokyo on Monday this week for . another public, yet privately-funded, series of engagements. The main . thrust of the prince’s visit was to attend a RUSI conference on . British-Japanese security co-operation, where he shared the stage with . Sir John Scarlett, former Director of the Security Intelligence Service . (MI6), and Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe. Japan is looking to spend . billions on its defence as tensions rise with China and pressure comes . from the US for the country to become more pro-active globally. As a . result huge defence contracts are up for grabs. According to . well-placed sources, the prince also took the opportunity to spend some . time privately with the Japanese royal family. After initially . refusing to discuss who was paying for the prince to be there, . Buckingham Palace eventually admitted – after being challenged by the . Mail – that RUSI had ‘made a proportionate contribution towards his . costs’. The think-tank also funded him to fly on to New York on . Wednesday this week, ostensibly to take part in further high-level . discussions on its behalf. Scrutiny: The Prince is the only member of the Royal Family who refuses to publish his travel detail in advance . A spokesman for the prince said he was a ‘great admirer of the RUSI’s work’. Sources . stressed Andrew did not receive a salary as a member of its . International Advisory Board and pointed out it ‘already has . well-established links with the Royal Family, in the form of the Queen, . who is its patron, and the Duke of Kent, its president’. A . spokesman for RUSI said they had been keen to invite Andrew to join . their advisory board as he ‘endorsed and consolidated RUSI’s status as a . leading independent international think tank’. However the latest revelations will, once again, shine an unwelcome spotlight on his activities. In . 2001 he became the UK’s Special Representative for Trade and . Investment. But he was repeatedly accused of wasting taxpayers’ money. The final nail in the coffin was the furore over his friendship with . Jeffrey Epstein, a US financier who has been jailed for soliciting . prostitution from underage girls. In July 2011 Andrew announced he was . standing down. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: . ‘Taxpayers will wonder why they are paying for the Prince’s gallivanting . across the globe, given that he is no longer a UK trade envoy. It is . imperative that the Prince is open and transparent about exactly how he . has spent taxpayers’ cash.’","Prince met with youngest daughter during final leg of 'official' world tour .

A convicted burglar who grew up being raped and beaten by her father and had three children by him is asking a judge to give her a lighter sentence on account of her horrific childhood. Tatiana Thibes' father, Lindolfo Thibes, first raped her when she was a child and as she grew older the sexual assault was accompanied by beatings and torture. He took her out of school in the sixth grade and set up surveillance cameras around their Los Angeles-area house to keep her prisoner. When he was arrested years later for stabbing her in the chest, the disturbing details of her ordeal finally came to light and he was sentenced to life in prison in 2009 for the pain he inflicted on her. Horror childhood: Tatiana Thibes, pictured, was first raped by her father, Lindolfo Thibes, when she was a child and as she grew older the sexual assault was accompanied by beatings and torture . Four years later, the 33-year-old is waiting to hear whether she too will go to prison for her part in a string of burglaries in Tujanga or whether a judge will allow her to see out her sentence in a rehabilitation center. Thibes appeared to be handling her life well, living with a boyfriend with whom she had her fourth baby and caring for her children, ensuring they got to school and did their homework. But after she was forced to talk about her abuse around the time of her father's 2009 trial, things seemed to unravel. She quit the therapy she was undergoing because discussing what happened made her feel worse. 'Not talking about it was the only way to protect my sanity,' she told the Los Angeles Times. 'I didn't want to face my worst fears, and that was getting counseling and confronting my abuse.' Prison: Thibes now works at the booking area of the Century Regional Detention Facility of Lynwood, California, pictured . A year and a half after her father's arrest she crashed while drunk driving on a freeway, and two of her passengers suffered minor injuries. She was put on probation. During the trial, she split with her boyfriend and started dating Adam Ortiz, a gang member with multiple run ins with the law. He was sent to prison on gun charges and three months after he got out, in June, 2010, he began burlarizing houses - with Thibes' help. Her job was to knock on doors to determine if anyone was home. If no one answered, she returned to her car and Ortiz, 25, and two other gang members broke in and robbed the house. A neighbor tipped off police, and the three were chased down then arrested. The men were convicted of the crime last year, each being sentenced to at least 12 years' jail. She was also found guilty but claims she took part because she was frightened of Ortiz, the father of her youngest child. Lesser sentence: Her lawyers are pushing for Thibes, pictured, to see out her sentence at a rehabilitation center with her children . She was jailed and her five children - aged from 2-16 - were taken from her. Thibes' attorney, Ron Seabold, is arguing that she should be sent to serve her sentence at a rehabilitation center where mothers can live with their children. 'We want to give her a chance, but she's in her early 30s....' Deputy District Attorney Richard Gallegly said. 'When will she stand up and take responsibility?' One problem, however, is a state law that says someone who commits a serious crime, such as burglary, while on probation for another felony must be sentenced to prison. Thibes had one more week on felony probation for her 2006 drunk driving offense when she was arrested for the burglaries, according to court records. She currently works in the booking area of the women's jail in Lynwood. It's not clear when she'll be sentenced. She said she wants to get her high school diploma and one day write a book, perhaps also become a therapist to help other women who have suffered similar trauma. As for her dad, she said: 'I want him to die miserably in jail.' Referring to Arial Castro's recent suicide, she added: 'I don't want him to die and end his life that quick.'","Los Angeles woman Tatiana Thibes had three children by her father during a 19-year ordeal that involved rape, torture and imprisonment .

Death's door: Connor Holloway, 14, lay unconscious for nearly 12 hours in a hospital's high dependency ward after collapsing just seconds after taking a legal high called Sensate . A mother has released this distressing photograph of her 14-year-old son as he lay unconscious in a hospital fighting for his life after taking a legal high. Doctors feared Connor Holloway could stop breathing at any moment as he remained in a coma-like state for nearly 12 hours. The schoolboy from Southampton, Hampshire, had been rushed to hospital after he collapsed within seconds of smoking a legal high called Sensate. His distraught mother Emma Holloway, who constantly remained at his bedside, said she had feared the worst when her son started suffering fits and his heart rate plummeted. Miss Holloway had earlier received a phone call from Connor’s friend who said he had fallen ill at his house on Saturday after taking a legal high which had been bought from a headshop in Southampton. The 33-year-old said: ‘I went inside and found him collapsed on the floor. He was lifeless. I thought he would come round but he didn’t.’ Connor was rushed to Southampton General Hospital in Hampshire by ambulance where he was treated in the high dependency ward. The mother-of-five added: ‘Doctors were talking about putting him into a medicated coma. ‘They feared he may have brain damage and could not give a time scale of when he would wake up.’ Connor said he experimented with the drug, bought in a shop called Up in Smoke in Southampton by his friend’s 23-year-old sibling, because he thought its legal status meant it was safe. But within a few moments he began feeling unwell. The schoolboy said: ‘I only had a tiny bit. It was instant - I just felt sick and fuzzy and could not see properly. ‘I went downstairs to put my head under the tap and that was the last thing I remember.’ Warning: Connor's mother Emma has released the distressing image of her son in hospital to draw attention to the dangers of legal highs . His next memory was waking up nearly 12 hours later in hospital. After the distressing incident, Mrs Holloway is demanding that controversial ‘legal highs’ - which killed 99 people in Britain last year - are banned. She has spoken out about her son’s potentially fatal ordeal in the hope of warning others about the dangers of legal highs. ‘When I realise how close he came to dying it is shocking and I feel so angry. ‘I can’t believe how dangerous it is. It should be banned immediately,’ she said. ‘It needs to stop because the next person is not going to be as lucky as Connor.’ Following the incident, Jaz Singh, who runs Up in Smoke, said he would remove the drug from his shelves. Emma Holloway, who constantly remained at his bedside, said she had feared the worst when her son started suffering fits and his heart rate plummeted . He claimed that Sensate was actually an air freshener and that there was a warning on the packet marked ‘not for human consumption’. Mr Singh added: ‘I have been selling the product for six months and have not had any problems.’ ‘We run a strict over-18s policy and challenge anyone under 25. I will be taking it off the shelves and will not be selling that product.’ - Connor Holloway . However, Maryon Stewart, whose 21-year-old daughter Hester died after taking a legal high, said that legal high shops like Up In Smoke needed to be shut down immediately. Mrs Stewart, who set up the Angelus Foundation to raise awareness about the dangers of legal highs, said ‘They are taking us all for fools.

Commons Speaker John Bercow has been called a ‘little weasel’ by a mother who reported him to police for allegedly ‘walloping’ her car. Nathalie Pulford dismissed the MP as an ‘arrogant toff’ after watching him try to squeeze his Volvo into a tight parking spot in Chelsea. The 42-year-old divorcee had been dining with her father and two sons, aged ten and 12, when she saw Mr Bercow attempting to manoeuvre his vehicle into a small space near her Range Rover. Rebuttal: Mr Bercow's spokesman said today that he would happy for Ms Pulford to take the matter up with his insurer . She believed she saw her luxury car move so ran outside the restaurant to tell off the Speaker. Mr Bercow denied pranging her car and said he had been offended by her behaviour. Miss Pulford, who has reported Wednesday evening’s incident to police, said she asked Mr Bercow if it was his Volvo and he said it was. ‘I asked him if he realised that he’d just bashed both cars to get in his spot and he said, “No I didn’t” so I replied “Yes you did because I was just watching you”. ‘He was not willing to discuss it and was completely dismissive of me. I stood there absolutely dumbfounded. ‘I said, “If you didn’t touch these cars how about you prove me wrong and get out without touching them?” and he said, “I will do no such thing” and “I am not required to leave this space therefore I won’t do it”.

Difference of opinion: Natalie Pulford claims John Bercow's Volvo struck her Range Rover but he says that he didn't . Indignant: Nathalie Pulford charged out of a Chelsea restaurant and said to the MP: 'Don't you realise you absolutely bashed into my car?' ‘I felt such a fool because something quite trivial had become out or proportion. 'If he’d have turned round and said sorry I wouldn’t have asked him to pay for it, but he kept looking at me square in the eyes and said, “I didn’t do it”. If I’d have seen how bad the damage was I’d have asked for his details.’ She said Mr Bercow’s car was covered in scrapes and scratches. Accusations: Natalie Pulford says 'he was being . really haughty, being a completely arrogant toff', but he says 'she was . clearly very irate, but I totally reject any suggestion (about) the . scratches on her car ' In the gap: Ms Pulford stands between her Range Rover and the Speaker's Volvo, which she said hit her vehicle and another in a tight manoeuvre . ‘He should have left a note on the window – that’s what I would have done. 'It’s disgraceful. He’s a little weasel. 'Everyone has bad days but it would be nice if he gave me an apology or just admitted it. 'Witnesses saw it happen. How can anybody be so conceited? I am sure he thinks he’s above the law.’ Mr Bercow admitted to a reporter at the scene that he was ‘not the best driver’ but insisted: ‘Am I too arrogant to say sorry? No. I’d be happy to fess up, but the fact is I didn’t touch her car.

Nearly 200 motorists are still free to drive on Britain’s roads despite being 100 years old or more. The number of people aged over 70 who hold driving licences has exceeded four million for the first time, according to the RAC Foundation. The oldest licence holder is a 107-year-old woman, while there are 191 people aged over 100 who have licences. Nearly 200 motorists are still free to drive on Britain's roads despite being 100 years old or more . Once motorists reach 70 they must declare every three years whether or not they are fit to drive – without having to take a driving or medical examination. Concerns have been raised that some elderly people could be continuing to drive when they are not fit to do so, while others give up their cars too early and risk exclusion from services and activities. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘All drivers should regularly consider their fitness to drive, but matters come to a head when we reach 70 and have to declare that we should be on the roads. ‘In general, older drivers have an enviable safety record, but it is clear that faced with this critical yes-or-no decision, many motorists simply do not have a realistic view of their capabilities. ‘For those reliant on a car, giving up driving will have a huge impact on their ability to live an active life, so it is important that they get all the help and support to make the right decision at the right time.’ The RAC Foundation found that there are 4,018,900 people aged over 70 with full British driving licences. As the post-war generation of ‘baby boomers’ reaches retirement, that four million figure is on course to exceed ten million, its figures reveal today. It is at age 70 - and every three years thereafter - that drivers must declare whether or not they are fit to drive . The foundation rejects calls for compulsory re-testing of drivers at a certain age because ‘it presumes that on reaching a particular birthday people’s physical and mental capacities change radically’. But coming to terms with a ‘growing bulge’ of older drivers will require changes in attitudes by younger drivers, who will be urged not to write off older drivers as being too old to be behind the wheel. It also puts responsibility on the older drivers to be honest with themselves if they find that growing incapacity means they are posing a potential risk to themselves and others. The RAC Foundation report notes: ‘The number of older people with driving licences has exceeded the four million mark. While not all of these licence holders will be active drivers the statistics illustrate the growing number of older people who still use a car. ‘And the total is set to increase dramatically.’ The Government has predicted that of the UK citizens alive today, around ten million will reach their 100th birthday. It is at age 70 – and every three years thereafter – that drivers must declare whether or not they are fit to drive. But the report notes: ‘This self-declaration is not made on the basis of any formal medical or driving test, but relies on the judgment of the individual.’ To help people make ‘the right decision’ the RAC Foundation is supporting the publication of a new guide called ‘Driving Safely for Life’, which aims to keep older people mobile and safe for longer. Drivers aged 75 and over make up 6 per cent of all licence holders but account for just 4.3 per cent of accidents involving death or serious injury. By contrast, drivers aged 16-20 make up just 2.5 per cent of all drivers but are involved in 13 per cent of accidents in which people are killed or seriously injured.","The oldest licence holder is a 107-year-old woman, RAC foundation says .

Mr Letta easily won the confidence vote in the Italian Senate, allowing him to keep his five-month old coalition alive. The actual voting was anticlimactic after former premier Berlusconi acknowledged defeat and said he would support Mr Letta after defections in his party robbed him of the backing he needed to bring down the government.

A grieving mother in Ohio is disgusted after she found her son's cremated remains wrapped in a Walmart bag. Nancy Bronner of Amelia, Ohio lost her 17-year-old son T.J. Mitchell last September due to a heart condition. Ever since he was 15, her son knew he wanted to be cremated when he died. So when he passed away, his remains were cremated and his ashes split among family members into four urns. Scroll down for video . What she found: Nancy Bronner says she wanted to hold her son one last time when she opened his urn and found his ashes wrapped in a Walmart bag . Disrespectful: Ms Bronner, left, has called the act a desecration of her son, right, T.J. Mitchell's remains . Upset: Ms Bronner took pictures of the desecration and then transferred the ashes out of the grocery bag . But Ms Bronner was surprised when she opened her urn. 'I just wanted to hold my baby one last time,' she told WCPO. 'So I opened the urn, and found  Walmart bag in the urn. The funeral home had put my son's ashes in a Walmart bag.' She calls the act disrespectful, unprofessional and a desecration of her son's remains. Explanation: The cremation was performed at McDaniel Funeral Home. Coroner Bob McDaniel says he put the ashes in the bag since the family didn't provide any and the urns didn't seal . T.J. was cremated at McDaniel Funeral Home in Dry Ridge, Kentucky by Bob McDaniel, who is also the Grant County coroner. The teens remains were being split between four urns - something the funeral home doesn't usually do - and no one in the family supplied bags for the urns which do not seal. In an attempt to make sure no ashes spilled out, Mr McDaniel used bags that he had on hand to wrap the ashed in the urns. He says he took scissors to the shopping bags to remove any store logos before wrapping the ashes. T.J.'s father Thomas Mitchell, and Nancy Bronner's ex-husband, says using the Walmart bags could be in bad judgement but doesn't believe the coroner acted maliciously. Mr Mitchell still keeps his sons remains wrapped in the grocery bag the funeral home provided. Understanding: T.J.'s father still keeps his son's ashes in the grocery bag provided . Ms Bronner has since taken her son's ashes to another funeral home to be placed in a clear plastic bag. Ms Bronner, who says she is in therapy over her son's death, has contacted the Kentucky Attorney General's Office and the Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors to complain about the funeral home. 'I don't care who you are, it's not right to put a human person's ashes in a Walmart bag,' she said. 'It is disrespectful. You don't do that to a parent who has lost their child. You don't do that to anyone. I just want to make sure that this never happens again to another person,' she said.","17-year-old T.J. Mitchell died last September from a heart condition .

Six James Bond toy cars designed by Corgi have been found in their original packaging nearly 50 years after they were intended for sale. The models of Bond's Aston Martin DB5 were kept by a sales rep from the firm who should have distributed them to toy shops. After being designed in 1964, in the wake of the classic Goldfinger film, in which Sean Connery starred as Bond, the six toys are expected to fetch around £8,000 when sold together at auction this week. Goldfinger, which featured the famous line, 'No Mr Bond, I expect you to die!', was the first of the films to feature 007's gadget-laden silver car. Six 49-year-old James Bond toy cars designed by Corgi have been found in their original packaging . The models, which were kept by a Corgi sales rep, are expected to make around £8,000 at auction this week . Sean Connery starred as Bond in Goldfinger, where he drove the Aston Martin DB5 . The cars come with a letter sent by Corgi to shops, advising 'Mr Retailer' to point out that 'secret instructions' are hidden inside the box . Corgi toys were introduced to the UK in 1956 when they were manufactured in Swansea, Wales. As well as creating a range of James Bond toys, the company has also created models of the cars featuring in Batman and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang among other films. While the Bond Aston Martin DB5 is widely considered its greatest design, other Corgi models are still auctioned for big money. The Corgi 267 Batmobile, for instance, can sell for more than £500. For a more modest fee, collectors can get a classic yellow Mini toy car or a Royal Mail van for less than £10 each. In 2012, Corgi designed a new Aston Martin DB5, to go along with the release of new Bond film Skyfall. The model costs £15.99 brand new from the firm. Corgi sprayed the model motors gold and included an ejector seat, which launched a plastic figure villain through the roof at the flick of a switch. They were found in the cellophane-wrapped boxes they were left in leaving the Corgi factory 49 years ago. The cars even come with a letter sent by Corgi to toy shops, advising 'Mr Retailer' to point out to 'every young purchaser' that 'secret instructions' are hidden inside the box. The instructions informed children how levers at the back and side of the car operated the bullet-proof rear windshield and machine guns that shot out from the front bumper. Another lever also activated the spring-loaded sunroof, projecting the gun-wielding villain into the air. Experts say the cars would decline in value when opened. A single original car out of its box today sells for around £500. Glen Chapman, of C&T Auctions of . Rochester, Kent, said: 'To have these toy James Bond cars still in their . original packaging and having never been opened is exceptionally rare. 'They are in mint condition and are presented as if they had just come from the factory. 'We have decided to sell them as they have been for the last 50 years and that is as a trade pack in their sealed boxes. 'It would be terrible to open them. They should be treated as an investment and locked away in a safe, a bit like a fine wine.' Out of their original packaging, the Corgi cars usually sell for around £500 . The finding of the cars, in their original cellophane wrapping, has been described as 'exceptionally rare' Corgi created the models of Bond's Aston Martin DB5 after the release of the Goldfinger film . Mr Chapman added: 'They shouldn't really be given to a grandchild to open and play with that's for sure. 'They belonged to a Corgi sales rep for about 30 years. Either they were surplus stock or he just kept them. 'He sold them to a private collector 20 years ago and he has now made them available at auction.'

The 25-year-old avoided being sent to prison after a judge was told he was a hard worker, and instead was given a deferred sentence pending 200 hours of unpaid work - and was driven away from court in the same Land Rover involved in the case. Investigators traced him Goody identifying the last vehicle flashed by the device. Goody, who has some learning difficulties and  was described by his defence lawyer Leon Kazakos as a highly-motivated and talented young man but 'not without his difficulties', was driving down Epsom Road in Merrow, Surrey, at around 2am on December 1 last year. Witnesses who were woken by 'a disturbance' said they saw a man in a Land Rover driving back to the traffic island the speed camera was on, the judge heard. Prosecutor Rhiannon Sadler said one resident 'could see a male moving around in the vehicle. 'He moved to the camera and poured something over it,' she said. The witness described seeing the man driving off a short distance before returning on foot and setting fire to the camera. When emergency services arrived in response to the call made by the woman and her husband, the camera was flat on the ground and damaged beyond repair by the fire, at a cost of more than £8,300 pounds. Officers investigating the attack, in Epsom Road, Merrow, Surrey, confirmed a Land Rover, listed as belonging to Goody, had been caught on that camera at the time of attack. On the road: Goody left court in the same Land Rover he was caught speeding in - and which he claimed had been stolen when the offence occurred . The following day Mr Goody reported his vehicle stolen, saying he had left it in a yard in Cobham and returned the following morning to find it missing. The black, short wheelbase Defender model was discovered in Shere a couple of days later, allegedly as a result of a call from the defendant. There was no damage to the exterior of the car, nor to the ignition. Goody then became evasive and officers, suspicious of him, carried out cell site analysis on his mobile phone which revealed he had been in the area of the fire at the time. Smashed: Police put out a plea for information after residents saw a man reverse up to the camera, pour petrol over it and set it on fire . He was arrested on January 29 by a traffic patrol and in interview he maintained his false account and was very defensive, officers said. Police charged him with arson and attempting to pervert the course of justice, which he later admitted. Miss . Sadler said the 25-year-old had convictions for affray, battery and . resisting arrest, and the probation service confirmed in March this year . he was convicted at Basildon, in Essex, of an assault. Stupid decision: Goody hugs friends and relatives outside the court on learning that he will do 200 hours unpaid work rather than being sent straight to prison . The defendant works for the county council and is also self-employed, carrying out tree surgery work and other garden and landscaping-related activities. The probation officer told the judge the defendant’s learning difficulties made him susceptible but that 'when he keeps busy it’s not a problem'. Mr Kazakos admitted his client's case was unusual, saying: 'Rather than seek the assistance of others as he ought to, he battles on alone, making things worse for himself. 'That night, in speeding past the camera, he would have attracted points and no more. What followed was a stupid decision which he will regret for the rest of his life.' Judge Christopher Critchlow, sitting at Guildford Crown Court, told Goody that the offences together may merit a jail sentence. He told him to do all or most of the 200 hours and to also continue to put money aside to put towards the bill for the damaged camera and/or the prosecution’s costs. Goody, of Hersham, Surrey, was ordered to return to court on March 14 next year.","Samuel Goody caught by speed cameras on Surrey road at 2am .

Ringo Starr's ultra-rare French touring car - once dubbed 'the world's fastest four-seater' - is set to sell for a staggering £350,000 at Bonhams auction house in London . Ringo bought the vehicle in 1964 after spotting it on a stand at the Earls Court Motor Show in London. The Beatles had just released their first movie A Hard Days Night and . broken big time in the US - with the top five singles at one time in the . American charts. The grand touring car, which is only one of two ever built, featured elegant bodywork by Jean Daninos and a massive 390bhp Chrysler Typhoon engine. Famous: The Beatles drummer paid £5,570 for the Facel Vegal Facel II, which he bought at the height of the band's unprecedented musical career . Its price tag was described as 'huge' at the time - enough to buy a couple of houses in the capital in the early Sixties. However, the car was believed to be ideal for a band member - with its huge V8 engine making light work of long motorway runs. The Chassis HK2 B160, bought new by Ringo, was the . very last of only 26 right hand drive Facel II's ever produced. It was delivered to Ringo's home in Weybridge, Surrey, and he owned the car for four years. Now, it is set to sell for between £300,000 and £350,000 at Bonhams auction house in New Bond Street, London, on Sunday, December 1. The French firm of Facel produced about 2,900 hand built cars during its few years of existence - all of which were stylish, luxurious and fast. Launched in 1961, the Facel II was priced in Rolls-Royce territory - with only 182 models ever built. It was bought by the rich and famous seeking something exclusive and distinctive, including Tony Curtis, Danny Kaye, Joan Fontaine and Ava Gardner. It was also favoured by great motor racing figures such as Sir Stirling Moss. The vehicle was destined to be the last of the V8-engined models - with production ceasing in 1964 after an unsuccessful venture into engine manufacture effectively bankrupted the company. Unique: The car, which is one of only two ever built, featured elegant bodywork by Jean Daninos and a massive 390bhp Chrysler Typhoon engine . Sholto Gilbertson, collectors car director at Bonhams, said: 'This car has to be one of the rarest and most collectable modern classic cars given its almost unique engineering and its place as part of pop music history. 'As Ringo drove this car he would have listened on the car radio to the Beatles total domination of the pop charts. 'The sale of this car represents a once in a lifetime opportunity for anyone who loves cars and the Beatles.' The Facel Vegal Facel II was a grand touring car produced by French firm Facel. The Facel Vegal Facel II was favoured by actress Ava Gardner . Launched in 1961, it was powered by a massive 390bhp Chrysler Typhoon engine - with a top speed of over 150mph.

But she managed to climb out and then began desperately hunting for her baby. Beckie pictured with her daughter Alexis (left), 5, and Imogen in her arms who survived four minutes under water . To her horror, Miss Thompson saw her . child's toes poking out of the water. She pulled Imogen, still strapped . into her car seat, free and placed her on the bank.

Jailed Pussy Riot singer Nadia Tolokonnikova dramatically ended her hunger strike yesterday after Russian officials promised she could move to another prison. The 23-year-old anti-Vladimir Putin campaigner was rapidly deteriorating when she agreed to eat her first food in nine days. Human rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin said Tolokonnikova had been assured her demands would be met after she wrote an open complaint alleging a threat to her life by a senior jailer, and 'slave labour conditions' in her penal colony. 'We agreed that she would end her strike, and that the prison service would treat with understanding her request to be moved to a different correctional facility,' he said. Agreement: Pussy Riot punk band member Nadia Tolokonnikova, 23, has agreed to end her nine day hunger strike on the condition she is moved to a new jail . She and fellow band member Maria Alyokhina were jailed for two years in August 2012, after being found guilty of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' over a protest against the Kremlin strongman in a Moscow cathedral. MP and human rights campaigner Ilya Ponomaryov, who yesterday visited her in Penal Colony No. 14 in Mordovia region, said she had 'stopped her hunger strike for medical reasons'. The prisoner's husband Pyotr Verzilov said she was in a stable condition but vowed she would restart her hunger strike if she was not moved to a new prison. The prison camps in Mordovia are remnants of Stalin's gulag labour camps. In an open letter, Tolokonnikova complained of 17 hour days in sewing workshops making uniforms, with humiliating punishments, officially-sanctioned bullying, and filthy sanitary conditions. One of her lawyers yesterday filed a complaint about the conditions at her prison to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Jailed: Nadia Tolokonnikova, right, sits alongside fellow Pussy Riot members Yekaterina Samutsevich, left, and Maria Alekhina, center, in a court in Moscow, Russia, last year, before being sentenced to two years in prison . Pyotr Verzilov of Voina art group, husband of jailed Pussy Riot member Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, looks on as a petition for his wife's early release from custody is heard . 'The situation in which Ms Tolokonnikova finds herself in the correctional colony no. 14 in Mordovia, Russia constitutes one of the abhorrent contemporary 'slave-like' practices,' lawyer Sergei Golubok wrote in English. Tolokonnikova's open letter ignited a fresh debate about filthy jail conditions and prisoner abuse in Russia. Rights activists have for years sounded the alarm over prison conditions in modern Russia, but few complaints from female jails have previously been made public due to what activists describe as a culture of violence and intimidation. Several prominent figures called on the young mother to stop her protest. 'Unfortunately, our society only reacts to extreme situations,' veteran rights activist Lyudmila Alexeyeva said on Moscow Echo radio. Nadia Tolokonnikova pictured in a single confinement cell at her penal colony in the village of Partza . Pressure: Supporters of Pussy Riot have attempted to apply pressure on the Russian government to release the jailed members . In April, Tolokonnikova appeared before a court to argue for her prison sentence to be suspended or reduced. The labour camp where she has been held for more than a year argued against her release.It said she was 'decisive, insensitive to ethics and conscience and thinking only about herself' and also reports that she once failed to greet a prison official during a hospital stay. One of the three Pussy Riot women jailed for hooliganism, Yekaterina Samutsevich, had her sentence suspended on appeal. Russia law does not make repentance a condition for an early release but the court is supposed to take into account the convict's behaviour in jail. The prison colony listed a penalty that Tolokonnikova received for failing to say hello to a prison official while she was in hospital and was once reprimanded for her refusal to go out for a walk while she was held in a Moscow jail.

It is usually Nessie who is making shockwaves around Loch Ness, but an earthquake struck the area at the weekend - which was felt over 15 miles away. The epicentre of the 2.4 magnitude tremor occurred about a mile south of Drumnadrochit at 8.49pm on Friday and at a depth of 2km. The British Geological Survey said it was felt by residents over a wide area all along the loch and is the latest in a series of quakes to hit the Highlands recently. The epicentre of the tremor was at Loch Ness (pictured) and it was felt by residents 15 miles away . The tremor is the latest in a series of quakes to hit the Highlands recently and had a depth of 2km . The BGS said that as well as people in Drumnadrochit, the quake was felt by residents in Inverness, Dores, Westhill, Errogie, Brinmore, Farr, Scaniport, Culduthel, Torness and Inverfarigaig. Some people described hearing a 'roaring sound; and the ground shaking. 'I felt the ground tremble and a roar like thunder,' said one woman from Inverness. 'It must have lasted a few seconds. Who knows - it might have been Nessie waking us up.' Situated at the head of Urquhart Bay on the northern shore of Loch Ness, Drumnadrochit is the home of the Loch Ness Monster mystery. The village is the home to the Loch Ness Centre, Nessieland Castle Monster Centre monster-spotting cruises, and nearby Urquhart Castle, beneath which is said to be the legendary underwater lair of Nessie. The quake came a day after the photograph hailed as 'the best ever taken of the Loch Ness monster' was revealed to be an elaborate hoax by its creator. Quake came a day after this photograph of the Loch Ness monster was revealed as an elaborate hoax . Cruise boat captain George Edwards said he has no regrets over his 'bit of fun' which fooled 'Nessie' experts. But critics have attacked his admission. The picture even fooled expert Steve Feltham, who has spent the last two decades hunting for Nessie. But now he says Mr Edwards is 'nothing more than a faker and a liar.' The famous 'Surgeon's Photograph' taken by Dr Robert Kenneth Wilson and published in 1934, which supposedly shows the monster's head and neck, also later proved to be a hoax. A million people visit the loch each year, creating £25million for the economy. There are roughly 200-300 quakes in Britain every year, but the vast majority are so small that no one notices them. However between 20-30 are over 2.0 magnitude which can be felt over a wider area. The largest known Scottish earthquake on land occurred near Loch Awe in 1880, with a magnitude of 5.2. UK earthquakes, particularly in Scotland, are most often attributed to glacial rebound. Until about 10,500 years ago much of the north of the UK was covered by a thick layer of ice - which pushed the rocks down into the underlying mantle. These rocks have been slowly rising back up ever since the ice melted, causing occasional earthquakes in the process.","Epicentre of the tremor occurred near Drumnadrochit, Scotland, on Friday .

Injured: The women is thought to have fallen from one of the Routemaster buses on route number 24, similar to the one pictured. (File photo) The . incident has led to a call from one London Assembly Member to halt the . introduction of the new Routemasters across the capital on safety . grounds. Darren Johnson, Green Party Member and Transport Committee Member said: 'In light of today’s tragic incident . as well as concerns raised by disability and other campaign groups, the . Mayor should order an immediate halt to the production of these . vehicles. 'Londoners’ safety must come first and there are serious doubts hanging over the Mayor’s flagship bus today.' He . added:'One of the main reasons why hop-on hop-off buses were phased out . of London’s transport system years ago was that they are not . appropriate for a modern, accessible public transport system.' The original routemasters were built between 1965 and 1968 and operated in regular London passenger service until 2005. The Routemaster withdrawal coincided with the introduction of London's single-deck bendy buses, however these proved accident prone and unsuitable for London traffic. Despite making up just 5 per cent of the London bus fleet, the bendy buses were involved in 20 per cent of all bus-related deaths in the capital. Scene: The accident took place as the number 24 bus headed south along Ferdinand Street, pictured, . The incident happened in Ferdinand Street, pictured on the map here . In his mayoral campaign ahead of the . 2008 election, Boris Johnson pledged to return the Routemaster to rid . the capital of the accident prone bendy buses. The . Mayor of London hit back at Darren Johnson's critique, accusing the . Green Party Member of speaking without knowing the whole story. ‘My primary concern is for the well-being of the woman who was injured in this incident,’ Boris Johnson told Mail Online. ‘A TfL investigation is underway but it would be wholly inappropriate to comment further until all the facts are known. 'It’s . a sad indictment of Darren Johnson that he has chosen to pre-empt that . investigation without knowing all the facts, and instead has used this . passenger’s misfortune to try and score political points. 'The . second staff member whose job it is to guard the back platform comes at . a cost of £62,000 per bus per year - £37m in total across the 600 buses . in operation – but even with this extra staff member, a passenger fell . onto the road and suffered serious injuries. Transport for London also said it would carry out a 'thorough investigation'. Mike . Weston, Transport For London’s director of buses, said: 'Our first . concern is, of course, for the passenger and we can confirm the . emergency services attended the scene. There will be a thorough . investigation into this incident.' Destruction: The collision on Chelsea Bridge Road, London, left twisted wreckage strewn across the carriageway . The new generation of Routemasters, . nicknamed 'Boris buses' after the London Mayor who introduced them at a . cost of £354,500 each, came into service last year after replacing the . iconic old version, which was phased out in all but a few tourist routes . in 2005. But since the latest incarnation of the popular buses were reintroduced they have been hit by problems before. Three . people were hospitalised last month after being injured when a new . Routemaster bus smashed into a queue of stationary traffic. The . number 11 bus was on its first day in service which it slammed into a . two other buses and a line of cars during the six vehicle pile-up. Transport for London has confirmed the bus was not following its normal route - between Liverpool Street and Fulham Broadway, on September 21 - when the crash happened at about 1pm on Chelsea Bridge Road. And in July, the buses left passengers fuming after faulty air conditioning caused temperatures on board to soar. Heat levels on some of the buses were found to have exceeded the maximum allowed for transporting farm animals across Europe. Upper-deck heat levels were recorded at more than 30C, according to an Evening Standard investigation.

After . the Respect at Work Review was published, one highranking staff member . left the Corporation, accepting her career had effectively come to an . end because she had voiced her concerns over an issue that subsequently . tarnished the BBC’s reputation. Measures . introduced after the Rose inquiry were designed to cut the grievance . procedure for sexual harassment and bullying complaints from 90 to 30 . days.

I was a freelancer at the time and could not afford to take the risk. The BBC is a national treasure. In terms of the quality of its news output, it can’t be beaten. But the viewing public has to know that behind this facade a culture of fear is allowed to thrive. This is because executives are a power unto themselves.

Five fire crews attended the incident, which happened at around 11am today. A spokesman for QinetiQ, the private defence contractor that runs the Blackgate Road munitions centre, said: 'No-one was hurt in the incident at our environmental test centre and we are conducting a full investigation into what happened as is part of our standard safety procedures.' He later added: 'As part of routine in-service testing conducted on behalf of the MoD, a planned and remotely controlled test took place at MoD Shoeburyness today. 'A contained fire occurred at one of the environmental test centre buildings on site following the test. No-one was injured. Tragic: Scientist Terry Jupp was killed following an explosion at the Shoeburyness site back in 2002 . 'The emergency services were called as part of standard procedures, their assistance was not required and they were subsequently stood down. 'An investigation is under way as part of our standard safety procedures.' A Government scientist was killed at the Shoeburyness site in August 2002 when he was left with horrific burns by secret bomb-making equipment. The 46-year-old was part of a small team of British and U.S. scientists involved in assessing the destructive capabilities of terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda in the aftermath of the September 11 terror attacks. The experiment attempted to measure the impact of homemade bombs similar to those used by terrorists. As part of the trial, Mr Jupp was told to mix a 22lb explosive charge using highly volatile chemicals at Foulness Island, part of the Shoeburyness site. The chemicals were mixed in a modified cement mixer before being poured into an old paint tin so they could be taken to the firing range. However, the explosive ignited unexpectedly and Mr Jupp, who worked for the MoD for 25 years, suffered almost 90 per cent burns. The heat from the explosion, which blew out all the windows of the building in which he was working, was so intense that it melted his hair to his head and charred grass up to 25ft away. The jury at the inquest into Mr Jupp's death, which was held in 2010, concluded that planning and risk assessment had not been appropriate.","Around 22lb of explosives were involved in the blast at MoD Shoeburyness .

A man has died after plunging 656ft down a mountainside in the Lake District. The 24-year-old was hiking with a companion on Helvellyn - the third highest peak in the country - when he lost his footing and fell to his death. A Royal Air Force Sea King helicopter was dispatched as part of a rescue mission - but the man's body was later recovered from Nethermost Cove. Location: Helvellyn, the scene of the death in the Lake District, is the third highest peak in the country . According to Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team, the hiker fell from Striding Edge between 3pm and 4pm yesterday. His walking partner found him unconscious - but because there was no mobile phone signal, he could not raise the alarm. He continued his descent into Grisedale where a local farmer gave him a lift to Patterdale so he could contact the emergency services. Paramedics, mountain rescue teams and search and rescue dogs were dispatched to search for the man, who is yet to be named. Scene: According to mountain rescuers, the hiker fell from Striding Edge (right) between 3pm and 4pm . However, more than four hours later, . they discovered his body in the large cove. Helvellyn, the third highest mountain peak in England, stands 3,117ft above sea level. Striding Edge is one of the most popular areas of the mountain with walkers and climbers - but is a notorious accident spot on the mountain. Mountain rescue teams say they are often called out to walkers in the area without basic equipment such as a compass or torch. During severe conditions they recommend full winter gear, including ice axes and crampons. A memorial is on the mountain to tourist Charles Gough, who died in 1805 while trying to cross Striding Edge to reach the summit. The Romantic poet William Wordsworth is also strongly linked to Helvellyn, after often climbing the mountain and also writing about it. Patterdale MRT leader Mike . Blakey said: 'This is a tragic incident involving the loss of a young . life. 'Our thoughts are with the young man's walking companion, friends and family at this difficult time.' Last year, a . 63-year-old fell runner died of hypothermia after he plunged 1,000ft in . the Lake District after race officials lost count of the entrants. Brian Belfield disappeared while competing in the gruelling Buttermere Sailbeck Fell Run on April 28, 2012. In August, an inquest at Cockermouth Coroner's . Court heard a total of 133 runners entered the 9.5-mile race but a . mix-up meant organisers assumed only 132 runners had taken part. By . the time rescue crews began searching the mountainside weather . conditions were too bad and his body was found the next morning. Despite . falling down the mountainside, Mr Belfield suffered no broken bones but . died from exposure after landing in a freezing puddle. In trouble: The man's walking partner found him unconscious on Helvellyn - but because there was no mobile phone signal, he could not raise the alarm . A Patterdale MRT spokesman said: ‘In spite of low cloud the (Great North) Air Ambulance was able to drop its paramedic crew and shuttle eight team members up towards Striding Edge. ‘A search was commenced and Penrith Mountain Rescue Team and Search & Rescue Dogs were requested to mobilise and assist with locating the injured man. ‘By the time that the RAF Sea King arrived on scene, (the) cloud base had lifted sufficiently for them to assist and the helicopter crew located the casualty from the air. ‘Team members on foot made their way to his location over steep lose ground but sadly he had sustained fatal injuries. The team doctor diagnosed death and his body was lowered in a stretcher to the waiting aircraft.’","Man was hiking with a companion on Helvellyn in the Lake District .

This is the moment the only female winchman in the RAF decided to risk her life - hanging by just a wire in a Force 8 gale - to save a fisherman. Sergeant Rachael Robinson, 37, was repeatedly slammed against the deck of the boat for 30 minutes as she tried to reach the crew member whose head had been smashed open in the chaos. She had already tried six times to lower herself from an RAF Sea King helicopter to reach the man as his condition rapidly deteriorated 50 nautical miles from Milford Haven. Life-threatening: Sgt Rachel Robinson emerges from the Sea King helicopter 50 miles from the Welsh coast. Hanging from just a wire she now faces half an hour of severe battering against the vessel to reach the man . Honoured: Sergeant Rachael Robinson has been awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal in the latest Operational Honours for her part in the daring rescue that saved a fisherman's life in a force 8 gale off the Welsh coast . But, after several near-fatal slips, called a lifeboat to do the job. When the lifeboat could not get anywhere near, Sgt Robinson decided to brave the horrendous conditions once more. And now the Queen has recognised her 'exemplary act of bravery' on March 21 in a list of military honours. Sgt Robinson, who worked with Prince William in the Falklands, was 19 when she joined the Force in 1995. She is one of just 117 women to make the Royal list. 'It was like running into a wall,' she said, describing the smashes which left her repeatedly winded. 'We tried six times initially then decided we had been lucky and were chancing our arm. Desperate: The lifeboat could not get close in the horrendous conditions, forcing Sgt Robinson to go it alone . Bravery: Flight Lieutenant Christian Wilkins, 28, had no reference points to judge how near or far they were . 'We requested the lifeboat to take the casualty off and I would transfer him from the lifeboat because that would get him to hospital faster. 'But we got the call from the lifeboat saying they could not get to him either, so we tried a few more times.' The horrendous gale conditions meant the helicopter's auto-hover and height hold systems did not work - and co-pilot Flight Lieutenant Christian Wilkins, 28, had no reference points to judge how far the aircraft was from the boat. On her final attempt she battled for 15 minutes to get aboard. After treating the casualty and getting . him back on deck, he was successfully lifted to . the helicopter and taken to hospital. Flt Lt Wilkins, who was awarded the Air Force Cross for his part in the rescue, said: 'There was no question from her. Queen's Awards: Sgt Robinson and Flt Lt Wilkins will receive their medals at Buckingham Palace later this year . 'She was going out, she wanted to go out. 'She is completely fearless.' Her citation for the Queen's Gallantry Medal reads: 'Robinson was frequently battered against the boat and although making contact with the foredeck each time, she was dragged off repeatedly by the severity of the boat movement. 'Despite the repeated impacts with the boat causing her great pain and the obvious dangers she faced of being severely injured or swept overboard, she never once gave up. Lengthy service: Rachel joined the RAF aged 19 in 1995. She had five years out to train in Iraq . 'Adrenalin junkie' Sgt Robinson, who worked with Prince William in the Falklands, adores her job . 'Through sheer determination and grit, she battled through the violent conditions until she had successfully made it to the casualty.' She has also received two more honours for the rescue - a commendation from the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society . and the master medal from the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators. Sgt Robinson, who has also worked in Iraq and as a police officer in Cheshire, hopes this will inspire other women into the job. 'There was one other woman but she left to become a doctor,' she said.

Outspoken: Judge Jamie Tabor, pictured, told the female gang member not to get pregnant again after she lost her unborn child . A judge told an 18-year-old girl not to get pregnant again after she breached a community order because she lost her unborn child . Sophie Duckett was sentenced to an 18-month community order in August for repeatedly punching a vulnerable young man in the face and stealing his Blackberry. However, she breached the unpaid work order because she suffered a miscarriage. His Honour Judge Jamie Tabor QC heard on Friday that Sophie Duckett was in breach of her community order. The judge said: 'Do not get pregnant again.' Duckett from Gloucester joined in a gang attack on 20-year-old Robert Paxman at Greyfriars on February 25, after one of the group lured the victim to the scene. The yobs took Mr Paxman's BMX bike and his Blackberry after giving him a beating. The victim was so traumatised, he moved away from the city. On August 6, prosecuting barrister Julian Kesner told Gloucester Crown Court: 'This defendant played a significant role in this group attack on a vulnerable young man who has a speech impediment and learning difficulties. 'When the victim's phone rang one of the gang grabbed it and handed it to this defendant. 'The defendant then punched Mr Paxman around the face. 'The victim suffered a bloody nose, split lip, torn ear and was generally given a nasty going over. 'He was shaken and started to cry and in a victim's statement he said that he has moved out of Gloucester.' Duckett was sentenced to an 18-month . community order with supervision, 180 hours of unpaid work and ordered . to pay £100 compensation to her victim. Judge Tabor told Duckett, at the time: 'You have had a chaotic life, a tough life especially as a child, and you need some stability. 'But it was a nasty, cowardly and bullying attack and I very nearly sent you to prison today.' Yesterday the judge added seven extra hours to her unpaid work total to mark the breach. The judge has previously gained media attention for his controversial rulings.

Downing Street was thrown into panic last night by a rebel Tory bid to force an early referendum on quitting the EU. In a direct challenge to the Prime Minister’s authority, Conservative MP Adam Afriyie said people did not trust David Cameron’s pledge to hold a vote on Europe in 2017. Backed by Tory and Labour Eurosceptics, he is set to force a Commons vote on the issue in five weeks’ time. If he wins, it would mean Parliament had ruled that the referendum should be fast-forwarded to next October. Panic: Conservative MP Adam Afriyie, left, has said that people do not trust a pledge made by David Cameron, right, to hold a vote on Europe in 2017 . Mr Cameron reacted with fury when he learned of the proposal last night – and immediately vowed to stop it at all costs. Downing Street made it clear the Prime Minister will refuse point-blank to accelerate the referendum. In a defiant response, a No 10 spokesman said: ‘We will not allow this amendment to be passed under any circumstances. The PM will not let it stand.’ Aides would not say how the PM intended to veto the amendment but he is prepared to withdraw the entire legislation if Mr Afriyie wins. And he may simply defy the parliamentary vote. It sets the scene for an extraordinary confrontation when MPs vote on the issue on November 8. Critics will contrast that stance with Mr Cameron’s compliance with the will of Parliament when it voted against him on military action in Syria. Rebel: Mr Afriyie, who says Britain should cut its ties with Brussels unless key powers are returned, claims he has ¿widespread support¿ from Tory and Labour MPs . A senior Government source said: ‘This is a deliberate attempt to sabotage the Prime Minister’s referendum plan. It is simply not possible to renegotiate our membership of the EU in under 12 months.’ Windsor MP Mr Afriyie, who earlier this year was accused of plotting a Tory leadership bid, has even named the exact date he wants the referendum: October 23 – the anniversary of the Battle of El Alamein, the turning point in the Second World War. Mr Afriyie, a self-made millionaire, will tomorrow table an amendment to the legislation which paves the way for the 2017 vote in an attempt to bring it forward to 2014. The rebel, who says Britain should cut its ties with Brussels unless key powers are returned, claims he has ‘widespread support’ from Tory and Labour MPs. End game: Mr Afriyie says his plan will end the row over Britain¿s place in Europe once and for all and kill off the threat UKIP¿s Nigel Farage (pictured) poses to the Tories . He says it will end the row over Britain’s place in Europe once and for all and kill off the threat UKIP’s Nigel Farage poses to the Tories. However, when Downing Street found out about Mr Afriyie’s challenge, alarm bells rang. If a referendum was held next year, the stakes could not be higher for Mr Cameron. He would almost certainly call for a pro-EU vote. If the British people voted to go it alone, he could be forced to resign, triggering a Tory leadership contest seven months before the General Election due in May 2015. But if the nation opted to stay in the EU, it could enhance Mr Cameron’s standing and pave the way for victory at the Election. Mr Cameron’s allies last night dismissed Mr Afriyie’s plan as ‘fantasy politics’. One said: ‘Afriyie has no real support and to suggest he is going to force us to bring the referendum to 2014 is absurd.’ Tory backbencher James Wharton, the Cameron loyalist who is sponsoring the 2017 EU Referendum Bill, vented his anger at Mr Afriyie, claiming his amendment could kill off the referendum completely. The Stockton MP warned: ‘Adam’s proposal will not make the progress of the Bill more likely. In fact, it will make it significantly less likely.’ Mr Wharton backs Mr Cameron’s approach of renegotiating Britain’s membership terms with Brussels, and holding  an EU referendum after the next Election. The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this year how Mr Afriyie and other Tory MPs critical of Mr Cameron had met secretly. He denied trying to undermine the Prime Minister, but he will face fresh claims  of disloyalty as a result of a provocative article in today’s Mail on Sunday in which he: . ‘The Prime Minister says we are going to have an EU referendum in 2017,’ writes Mr Afriyie. ‘The British people .  .  . don’t understand why we can’t have one right away – and that makes them suspicious. Memorable date: General Bernard Montgomery during the advance on El Alamein. Afriyie has picked October 23 for referendum ¿ the anniversary of the Battle of El Alamein, the turning point in the Second World War . 'Many people think delaying the vote is just a tactic to allow all the political leaders to kick the can even further down the road. 'To achieve the land of opportunity .  .  . we must resolve our relationship with Europe and that should not wait until 2017.’ He said delays on the vote will drive large numbers of voters to UKIP, leading to ‘a distinct danger that Labour will gain a majority and we will never see a referendum at all’. Mr Afriyie said opinion polls showed that the majority of people want a referendum before the next Election. Linking the date with El Alamein echoes the decision by SNP leader Alex Salmond to hold next year’s Scottish independence referendum on the anniversary of Scotland’s victory at the Battle of Bannockburn. Headache: The initiative poses problems for Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, who has refused to back a referendum while Nick Clegg, right, will launch an open attack this week on Cameron for calling a referendum . Mr Afriyie claims that the choice of October 23 is a coincidence, and is the ‘only practical date’ for the vote next year. His initiative also poses a headache for Ed Miliband. So far the Labour leader has refused to back any referendum, but some of his MPs could use the amendment to rebel against him. In a separate development, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will this week launch an open attack on Mr Cameron for calling a referendum, claiming quitting the EU would be ‘economic suicide’ and  accusing Mr Cameron of ‘threatening to flounce out of Europe’. New role? Sajid Javid . A Tory MP who has been tipped as a future Chancellor is in line for rapid advancement in a Government reshuffle this week. Treasury Minister Sajid Javid, the son of a bus driver, will be given a senior ministerial job at ‘the door of the Cabinet’ by David Cameron, as the Prime Minister hands out promotions to the brightest members of the 2010 intake of Tory MPs. Comprehensive-educated  Mr Javid, 43, has only been in the Commons since 2010. But the Muslim former banker, who is politically close to George Osborne, has impressed colleagues as a junior Treasury Minister and is seen as a safe pair of hands both in the Commons and in media interviews. One of five sons, Mr Javid was born in Rochdale, Lancashire, but brought up in a crime-ridden area of Bristol. He became a vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank at just 25 and later a director of Deutsche Bank. But, inspired by Margaret Thatcher’s premiership, Mr Javid, who is married with four children, gave up banking to focus on politics. His wife Laura is a Christian, sparking Mr Javid to say last year: ‘She goes to church more often than I go to mosque.’ The Prime Minister is being urged by advisers to promote women, ethnic minority MPs, northern MPs and those from less affluent backgrounds. The drive follows findings by focus groups that the party is still regarded as a bastion for white, middle-class, southern males. Speculation that a reshuffle was imminent heightened on Friday when Rail Minister Simon Burns quit – to fight for the vacant post of Commons Deputy Speaker – and was not immediately replaced. Labour leader Ed Miliband  is also expected to carry out  a reshuffle this week, with Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeves backed to replace Liam  Byrne as Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary. Douglas Alexander is expected to keep his job as Shadow Foreign Secretary, but also be handed the job of the party’s campaign co-ordinator, succeeding Tom Watson.","Tory MP Adam Afriyie said people did not trust David Cameron to hold referendum in 2017 .

The driveway of a house is usually reserved for a car, a van and often a caravan, but military enthusiast Anthony Cooke knew it would be perfect for another type of vehicle. He parked his rare monster World War One tank in front of his home, much to the astonishment of his neighbours . Mr Cooke, 57, has been keeping the huge 21ft long army tank on his driveway on a residential estate while he refurbishes it in time for next year's centenary of the start of the Great War. Tanks a lot: Neighbours were stunned when military enthusiast Anthony Cook parked his World war One Mark IV tank outside his home in Cottenham, Cambridgeshire . War game: Anthony hopes his tank will form part of a Great War living history museum he is planning to open . Second front: Anthony is refurbishing the Mark IV in time for next year's centenary of the start of the Great War . In action: One of the Mark IV tanks rolling over hillside during the Great War . The vehicle, which is 13ft wide and weighs six and a half tonnes, is one of just two working replica Mark IV tanks in Europe. It has taken Anthony, from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, seven months to finish the outside of the tank, which has cost around £40,000 to buy and re-build. He has now started work on the interior. Mark IV army tanks were first introduced in . 1917 and fought in the Battle of Messines Ridge. Only 1,220 were ever built -  420 'Males', 595 'Females' and 205 Tank Tenders (unarmed vehicles used to carry supplies). They cost around £5,000 . to produce and could go at a top speed of 4mph. They remained in official service until the end of the war. The Mark IV Male carried three Lewis machine guns –  as well as the two sponson guns. The Female had five machine guns. During the Messines engagement, many of the sixty-plus Mark IVs lagged behind the infantry, but several made important contributions unlike their experience at the third battle of Ypres. Many of the tanks became immobilised and easy targets for enemy artillery after sinking into swampy ground. The last M IV to see service was restored to operational status in the early years of World War II and driven from Whale Island, off Portsmouth, to the mainland, where its new career was allegedly brought to an early end after a number of cars were damaged. He said: 'People do get a shock when they first see the tank in the middle of a residential estate. but  I'm very lucky as my neighbours love it and one little boy even says good night to it each evening. 'It takes up my entire drive and I now have to park my car down the road, but it's worth it as it will look great when it is finished.' Anthony, who works for a bio tech company, has taken the tank to a number of shows and hopes it will form part of a Great War living history museum he is planning to open in nearby Dry Drayton, Cambs, next year. 'My grandfather was in the Great War and I started to research his past and became besotted with it,' he said. 'Now the last WW1 soldier has died it has passed from memory to history and we need a way to pass on that knowledge. 'I hope the centre will be somewhere school parties can visit to see how soldiers fought and lived on the Western Front.' The replica tank was originally built for Kenneth Branagh's film The Magic Flute, which was set during World War 1. The only other replica working WW1 tank was built for Steven Spielberg's film War Horse.

Music lovers snapped up all of the coveted tickets in just 87 minutes - sending internet servers into meltdown. Their frantic purchasing - seeing an eye-watering 3,000 tickets bought every minute - beat last year's record by more than 10 minutes. Popular: Crowds watch Mumford & Sons perform on the Pyramid Stage at this year's Glastonbury festival .

More than a million would-be festivalgoers got up early in a bid to secure a spot at the legendary event. They descended on official booking website seetickets.com at 9am in the hope of buying one of the £210 tickets. However, fans were forced to wait half an hour after site crashed due to overwhelming demand. Delighted: Organiser Emily Eavis and her father Michael said they had been 'blown away' by the overwhelming demand for tickets . By 10am, a whopping 80,000 tickets had already been bought and less than half an hour later, organiser Emily Eavis announced the remainder had gone. She tweeted: 'We have sold out in record time. Thanks to everyone for all your efforts and patience and we are very sorry to those of you who missed out.' In a joint statement with her father Michael Eavis, she said the pair had been 'blown away' by the size of demand. It read: 'We are sorry that many of you missed out on a ticket. We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply, it is an unfortunate inevitability thatsome people will be left disappointed.' An allocation of early-bird tickets - offered to selected fans - went on sale on Thursday and were snapped up within 30 minutes. Earlier this year, Mr Eavis said 2014's headliners - who have never played Glastonbury before - had already been booked, but refused to reveal who they were. Fleetwood Mac, Prince, David Bowie and even Oasis - who have not played together since a bitter split in 2009 - have all been tipped to appear. This year's bash at Worthy Farm, Pilton, Somerset, saw the Rolling Stones headline the famous Pyramid Stage to rave reviews.","All 120,000 tickets were snapped up in a record-breaking 87 minutes .

Sales of the staple have soared by almost a third (31 per cent) in the past year as shoppers opt for healthy wholegrains over processed white bread. Seed bread is popular with dieters as it releases energy more gradually, leaving you satisfied for longer. It is also very high in nutrients. Popular: Seeded loafs have been flying off the shelves across Britain . Fruit loaves are flying off the shelves, too, with sales of bread with dates and cranberries up 37 per cent. The figures, published by National Craft Bakers’ Week, show the bread market is worth £2.1billion in total. Cake is close behind at £1.8billion, with traditional British treats gaining ground over American snacks. Doughnut sales rose 3.3 per cent last year and cookie sales by 5.2 per cent, but both were soundly trumped by classic favourites scones (19 per cent), Eccles cakes and hot cross buns (both 8 per cent). Ivor McKane, chair of National Craft Bakers’ Week emphasised how demand has increased. He said: 'Bakers from across the country are seeing a huge increase in demand from their customers for more speciality breads. Old favourites: Traditional treats like the scone (right) are outpacing sales of American snacks like dougtnuts (left) 'This is for health reasons as well as taste but it’s great to see traditional items such as Eccles cakes and teacakes in increasing demand. 'However, despite this growth in sales, it is still vital that the public support their local craft baker. 'This will ensure that these products continue to be available on the high street. Support: British shoppers are being urged to buy a loaf from their local baker this week . 'Being a craft baker requires an immense amount of skill and dedication and often recipes are passed down through the generations. 'But whilst many have been in business for decades, they need support. 'We would urge the public to visit their craft baker and find out for themselves what they have to offer.' National Craft Bakers’ Week, which runs from 7-13 October, supports the Teenage Cancer Trust and bakers will be fundraising for the charity.","The loaves, favoured by dieters, have seen sales increase by 31 per cent .

A female robber who tricked her way into a blind 91-year-old pensioner's home before tying her up and gagging her with a tea towel has been jailed for 10 years. Sandra Mowbray, 43, conned her way into the house of her frail victim by pretending to be a council worker who had come to read her meter. She attacked the grandmother of four, before binding her hands together with a belt and stuffing a tea-towel in her mouth to stop her from calling for help, a court heard. Jailed: Mowbray, left, assaulted the 91-year-old pensioner while her boyfriend Payne, right, stood guard outside . Unemployed Mowbray then dragged the vulnerable pension upstairs and ordered her to lie on her bed at her home in Oldbury, West Midlands, while her boyfriend Lee Payne, 39, stood guard outside. The thief rifled through the blind woman's personal belongings, before escaping with £130, credit cards and a necklace, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard. When Mowbray confessed to her sister and brother-in-law , the couple were so horrified they turned her into the police. She was jailed for 10 years on Friday after pleading guilty to robbery and theft. Her partner Payne was sentenced to two-and-a-half years after admitting theft and assisting an offender. Sentencing the pair, Judge John Edwards told them: 'Your crime was truly despicable.' Today, the elderly victim vowed to get over her terrifying ordeal at the hands of the pair. Speaking from her home, the resilient pensioner said: 'I'm not going to let this beat me. Sentence: Mowbray was jailed for 10 years at Wolverhampton Crown Court (pictured) on Friday after pleading guilty to robbery and theft. Her boyfriend Payne was sentenced to two-and-a-half years . 'I don't answer the door now unless I know who it is. Where I come from, people respected each other and treated each other well. It just seems that is not the case these days.' The woman, who needed five stitches after the attack, said she was shocked by what unfolded at her home on June 15 last year. 'It was just so unexpected,' she said. 'With women, you just don't expect another woman to turn on you like that. It's a shock and she was a lot taller and a lot stronger than me. But I'm doing well now and the police and my family have been marvellous with me.' The victim's family also welcomed the sentences - branding the attack 'cold, callous and calculated'. The court heard Mowbray knew the victim was frail, registered blind and vulnerable. She first approached her home at some point between June 1 and 15, claiming to be a council worker needing to read the meter. She managed to get inside by asking to use the toilet and stole £13, while Payne acted as a lookout outside the house. Mowbray then returned to the house at around 7.30pm on June 15, telling the victim she believed she had left her keys inside. Despite being suspicious, the pensioner let her into her home. However, after checking for her keys, Mowbray demanded money, and became angry when the pensioner told her she didn't have any. Howard Searle, prosecuting, said: 'She started swinging her, twisting her about the room by the arms.' The pensioner fell and hit her head against the kitchen door - causing blood seep from the wound. Mowbray grabbed a tea towel and wrapped it around the elderly woman's head, before binding her hands with a belt. She then went upstairs to search the rooms, leaving the victim lying on the floor. Mr Searle added: 'She began to wriggle free, and managed to sit up. She started to shuffle and manoeuvre her way towards the door.' But Mowbray spotted the pensioner's attempts to break free and grabbed her - dragging her up the stairs and ordering her to lie on the bed. After making off with her belongings, Mowbray then told the woman to stay on the bed and count to 100, or 'there would be trouble'. When police arrested the pair, from Oldbury, the necklace was found in their home and £70 of the money was found on Payne. The rest had been spent on buying booze. David Bratt, defending Mowbray, told the court that she had gone to the house to steal and never intended to use force, while Mr Michael Anning, defending Payne, said he never entered the house and was only involved because he wanted money to buy alcohol.","Sandra Mowbray, from Oldbury, West Midlands, conned her way into the pensioner's home by pretending to be a council worker .

Families face having their bins collected just once a month under radical plans being considered by local authorities. Bin and black bag collections could be cut to just once every four weeks under proposals to reduce waste by Cardiff City Council. But its reforms could set a precedent and are being considered by other local authorities, according to the consultation document for the plans. Outrage: Cardiff city council has caused a storm with the proposal to cut collections to one a month . Any such move would anger householders who have already seen a shift from weekly to fortnightly collections of their waste. The Labour-run council was immediately lambasted for its ‘barmy’ idea by Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles. But the council has vowed to push ahead with controversial proposals to meet a target to have 70 per cent of all waste recycled by 2025. It will continue picking up recyclable materials, such as glass, plastics and paper, every week. General waste would only be collected 12 times a year, however, under one of the proposals. Householders who put the wrong sort of rubbish into recycling bins would face fines. The local authority is also considering a ‘pay as you throw’ charge based on how much waste is collected. Families that recycled more would pay less, while the council could impose standard fees for bin bags and wheelie bins. But such a charge would need a change in legislation first by the Welsh government. Smaller bins could also be introduced to force families to throw away less rubbish. The size of wheelie bins would almost halve, from a 240 litre capacity to 140 litres. Cut backs: It is a bid to cut £125million in three years. Residents may also be charged to bin their waste . Target: Recycling will be picked up weekly in a bid to reach the council's 2015 target of a 58 per cent increase . Black rubbish bags - which are still used across a third of the city - could be limited to two or three per household, to force families to cut down on waste. And residents could even see an annual limit to how many visits they can make to the dump or waste and recycling centre. Residents could even be forced to put their rubbish into clear rather than black bin bags, to ‘shame’ them into recycling more. In its consultation document, Cardiff said it needs to make ‘extremely serious’ savings of £125 million over the next three years as well as meeting binding Welsh Government targets for recycling of 58 per cent by 2015/16 rising to 70 per cent by 2024/25. 'Barmy': Eric Pickles, Communities and Local Government Secretary, has lambasted the policy . ‘Each of the following ideas is a . potential scheme that Cardiff could use to meet the future recycling . target of 70 per cent. All have been used or identified as options by . other local authorities or central government to divert waste from . landfill and increase reuse and recycling,’ it said. Cardiff has already slashed its general waste collections to twice a month. Mr Pickles said: ‘These barmy bin policies will harm the local environment by fuelling fly-tipping and back yard burning. ‘Hard-working people will suffer from a derisory bin collection service in return for paying a fortune in council tax, which has not been frozen in Wales.’ There are also fears that the piling up of nappies, sanitary and medical waste could pose a health hazard. But Cardiff Council said it would collect sanitary and food waste more frequently than its monthly general waste collections, to stop the growth in vermin. In its consultation document, the council said: ‘As recycling becomes part of our daily lives, it’s been argued that there should be little or no waste that needs to be thrown away. ‘With food and recycling all collected weekly, hygiene services, bulky collections and more and more materials being recycled, what is there left to throw away? ‘A number of local authorities that have well established fortnightly general waste collections are now considering smaller bin capacities or reducing the frequency of the general waste collections to once every three or four weeks.’ The document added: ‘We do not yet know what will be implemented.’ A final decision on which of the options it will adopt is due next year.","The local authority has to cut back on £125million over the next three years .

The eldest son of alcoholic child killer Amanda Hutton has apologised for his part in covering up the death of his four-year-old brother. Tariq Khan failed to tell anyone that his little brother Hamzah had died of extreme neglect and malnutrition and he stayed quiet when the tiny boy's starved body lay mummified in his cot for two years. The 24-year-old was in the house when Hamzah died but was a ‘mummy’s boy’, subjected to ‘emotional blackmail’ by her and feared for his siblings’ lives if he spoke out. He claimed that his mother threatened to kill five of his brothers and sisters if he turned her in, holding a knife to one of the children's throats, and ‘threatening to burn the house down’ if he said anything about Hamzah’s death. Hutton was jailed for 15 years at Bradford Crown Court, after being found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence. She had pleaded guilty to cruelty to five other children and failing to lawfully bury Hamzah’s body. Khan, who also pleaded guilty to the burial offence, was given a two-year suspended sentence. The Sunday Mirror reports that just moment after the trial, Khan sent a text to his father Aftab Khan, apologising for his part. It said: 'Dad, I’m sorry if I’ve ever hurt you. Sorry if I’ve let you down.' A two-week-long trial heard how . Hamzah's decomposed body was discovered in a travel cot and covered with . insects in Hutton's bedroom at their filthy home. He died in December 2009 due to malnutrition after his mother's addictions to alcohol and cannabis took over her life. The estranged father - who was ordered to stay away from his wife in 2008 after admitting battering her - claims that he had approached social services with concerns about his children's safety, but that they had been ignored. He claims he then approached police and asked them to check on the children but officers found nothing of concern. Mother-of-eight Amanda Hutton was found guilty of the manslaughter of her own son. Hamzah's decomposed body was found in his mother's Bradford home two years after he died in 2009 . This is the home in which little Hamzah spent his short life before mother Hutton let him starve to death . The young child's body was found in a travel cot, under piles of clothes. He had wasted away to such an . extent that when he died he was wearing baby clothes of a six to . nine-month-old baby. Almost every room in the house was filled with . mounds of plastic bags of household rubbish, bottles, used nappies, . newspapers, cat faeces, vomit and mouldy food. Fed on just a banana and some milk a day, he . scavenged around for scraps. Officers searching the property also . found five of his siblings, aged between five and 13, living among the . knee-deep pizza boxes, used nappies, vodka bottles and cat faeces. Abusive relationship: Hutton was 16 when she met 18-year-old Aftab Khan outside a nightclub in Bradford . Seasoned officers described being overcome by emotion as they witnessed one child in the house rummaging among rotting rubbish in a bedroom for items before they took the youngster away. Other officers talked of rotten food and an almost unbearable smell in the four-bed terraced house. Neighbours have spoken of their amazement when children they had never seen before emerged from the property on the day the police arrived. A serious case review into Hamzah's death has been conducted by the Bradford Safeguarding Children Board (BSCB) which will be published later this year. It will examine all the many contacts Hutton's family had with agencies including the police, social services, schools and health organisations.","'Mummy's boy' Tariq Khan failed to tell anyone his brother Hamzah had died .

Under fire: BBC HR boss Lucy Adams has seen a 109 page dossier containing allegations of sexual harassment and bullying at the corporation . Shocking allegations of sexual harassment and bullying at the BBC are laid bare for the first time today after the disclosure of a confidential report to The Mail on Sunday. The 109-page dossier, seen by senior executives at the BBC including under-fire HR manager Lucy Adams, includes claims that: . The damning dossier – called Bullying And Harassment At The BBC – was compiled by the National Union of Journalists and was one of the pieces of evidence submitted to senior managers at the BBC last December after it commissioned an inquiry into sexual harassment and bullying. The inquiry, the Respect At Work Review – also known as the Rose Report – was led by Dinah Rose QC. Despite the allegations, Ms Adams said in January there was ‘not a particular problem’ with bullying and maintained the issue was historic when the Rose Report was published in May. MPs last night called for an urgent . review into the dossier with John Whittingdale MP saying he would press . the issue with BBC director general Tony Hall. Mr Whittingdale, chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said: ‘These are strong claims. 'They provide further evidence of a long-standing culture of bullying and harassment of employees in the BBC. 'We want to be assured changes are being made by management and we need to be told what these are.’ Damning: The BBC dossier was compiled by the National Union of Journalists and was one of the pieces of evidence submitted to senior managers at the BBC last December . Rob Wilson MP said what happened in the Afghan department ‘could easily be described as misogyny’, adding there were now questions over the role of Ms Adams in the Rose Report. He added: ‘The Rose Report looks increasingly like a PR operation for the BBC rather than a real attempt to get to grips with its own rotten culture.’ The dossier gives details of a claim that a woman was offered a promotion if she accepted dinners with the boss. ‘I naturally declined, but another temporary marketing manager, covering maternity leave, accepted and she was given the job,’ the woman said. Women in the Afghan department said they were told to cover-up and ‘act like good Pashtun girls’ – and allege bullying is still going on. One presenter whose boss mouthed the words ‘You’re c***’ while she was on air said her bullying experience left her suicidal. Another allegation is that one manager was given a pay-off before he had a chance to be disciplined for sending filthy messages to female graduates. The Rose Report, which was set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, took testimonies from 930 staff. It looked at BBC policies and processes relating to sexual harassment and bullying – and led to the Corporation overhauling its bullying and harassment policy. Ms Adams, who was called a liar during a parliamentary committee debate after being accused of changing evidence on executive pay-offs, told BBC magazine Ariel on January 14 there was ‘no reason to believe we have any particular problems’ with regard to a bullying culture. When the Rose Report was published on May 2, she acknowledged it ‘does make uncomfortable reading’, but added: ‘Thankfully incidents involving sexual harassment were extremely rare and the BBC culture of today is very different to the past. 'Clearly one example is too many but I was pleased to hear that sexual harassment is not something our people were experiencing.’ Allegations: Former Newsreader Selina Scott hit out at the BBC in a Mail on Sunday article . Outspoken: Selina Scott claimed that once your age exceeds your bra size at the BBC you are finished . One source close to the investigation . said: ‘Lucy Adams is the woman who was the BBC lead on the Rose Report . so she knew the detail intimately. These issues happened on her watch and she is now the woman who is effectively in charge of implementing change.’ Mr Wilson MP added: ‘As head of personnel, Lucy Adams has a lot to answer for and should have been sacked some time ago. ‘The fact she is still there suggests a lack of seriousness.’ Concern: MPs last night called for an urgent review into the dossier with John Whittingdale MP , pictured, saying he would press the issue with BBC director general Tony Hall . The BBC was also accused last night of breaking recommendations in the Rose Report over the case in the Afghan department. It . was alleged one manager found guilty of bullying was disciplined by a . friend – counter to guidelines which said complaints should be . transparent and removed from those in any way connected to those . involved. Last week, Daud Junbish, a producer in the Afghan department, was given a final written warning after the BBC partly upheld several complaints of bullying and harassment. Mr Junbish kept his job, but one BBC insider said the disciplinary action decision was taken by someone known to him. Reaction: The Rose Report was set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal . One woman involved is due to complain about the decision. In December last year, Mr Junbish emailed one woman’s father from the BBC. Apologising to the woman’s father for ‘stooping to a low level’, he said his daughter had ‘violated the ethics of Pashto, friendship and seniority, as well as those of the BBC’. The email could have had disastrous consequences as the woman explained: ‘In Afghan culture when you see a woman outside her boundaries then you tell the man in the family to sort that out. 'If my dad was a different Afghan man, he would beat me up, physically, and stop me from work.’ She added: ‘I have been on antidepressants for two and a half years. 'I have to stop it but those made me feel alive.’ Last month former newsreader Selina Scott spoke out against BBC sexism in The Mail on Sunday. A BBC spokesman said it was now implementing more training and a confidential whistleblowing hotline for staff. He said: ‘The BBC initiated the Respect At Work review to help tackle any form of bullying and to ensure that staff have the confidence to report concerns. ‘Under Lucy Adams’s stewardship the BBC has made huge improvements in tackling bullying – including bespoke training and cases now being heard outside of the relevant division. 'Recent information showed there were approximately 30 cases of alleged bullying being investigated in an organisation of almost 17,000 staff.’ Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly won an employment tribunal against the BBC on the grounds of ageism after she was replaced by a younger host. The 56-year-old has also claimed to be a victim of sexual harassment at the hands of a senior BBC executive. The BBC is long on soul-searching but short on culture change. I wish I could say I was surprised to read these shocking accounts of bullying and sexual harassment, but sadly I’m not. More than 930 people gave evidence to the Dinah Rose inquiry. Some have now withdrawn it because they have no faith in BBC promises that they won’t be penalised for speaking out. Age discrimination: Miriam O'Reilly . At open sessions held for staff to discuss their experiences of harassment and bullying there’s been silence – no one except union representatives have felt they can speak openly without facing repercussions. After the Respect at Work Review was published, one highranking staff member left the Corporation, accepting her career had effectively come to an end because she had voiced her concerns over an issue that subsequently tarnished the BBC’s reputation. Measures introduced after the Rose inquiry were designed to cut the grievance procedure for sexual harassment and bullying complaints from 90 to 30 days. But the deliberation time has doubled to 180 days and some serious cases have not been resolved at all. Staff who were brave in coming forward with their experiences now feel the people who made their lives a misery at work will get off lightly because there is no real will by human resources to get to the truth. I gave evidence to the Rose inquiry about a manager who offered me a job, but I then found out he wanted sexual favours in return. When I went to see two senior members of staff for advice about bringing a formal complaint, they warned me that the BBC would always side with its managers and that if I went ahead it would be unlikely that I would work for the Corporation again. I was a freelancer at the time and could not afford to take the risk. The BBC is a national treasure. In terms of the quality of its news output, it can’t be beaten. But the viewing public has to know that behind this facade a culture of fear is allowed to thrive. This is because executives are a power unto themselves. They stick together and guard each other’s backs.","More than 930 people gave evidence to the Dinah Rose inquiry on bullying .

If you sleep in the foetal position, you might want to be finally laid to rest that way too. That’s the thinking behind an artist’s pebble-shaped coffins, made from sculpted birch. Davina Kemble, 59, was inspired to start the project when she was diagnosed with stomach cancer and started making her own final resting place as a piece of art. Unique: Each coffin is handcrafted from birch ply and fully biodegradable . The mother of four from Wiltshire, who had been working with wood for 23 years, said: ‘It’s a comforting thought for me – to know where I’m going to end up and create a warm environment for myself … I hated the thought of being laid out flat on my back.’ She has now launched the design as a business after being given the all-clear from doctors. The £4,000 handmade coffins come in three standard sizes or bespoke. Mrs Kemble said: ‘I’m happy to have made a piece of art that people can be buried in.’ ‘It has always been my intention to create my own resting place. It’s a comforting thought for me- to know where I’m going to end up and create a warm environment for myself.’ Morbid: Mrs Kemble said she 'hated' the idea of being laid out flat in a traditional style coffin . Despite having the unwavering support of her husband Brian Kemble, 62, the head of a piano manufacturers in Vienna, Davina admits her four children were horrified at her work. ‘They thought what I was doing was completely unacceptable and disgusting. It was very difficult for them. I was working from home and they couldn’t believe that I was planning my own burial like that. ‘I know people think it’s a perverse way to think about death, but it was my way of dealing with things and now, my design can help other people too. Davina lives in Wiltshire with her husband Brian, 62. Her four children Amy and Tania, 32, Juliette, 29 and Angus, 27 have since warmed to her project. ‘They came round to the idea once they saw how beautiful and tasteful the final product is.’ The top of the range birch plywood coffins are handmade by coffin manufacturers in Nottingham to look uncannily like smooth pebbles. They have concealed handles so they can be lowered into a grave and are fully biodegradable. They are lined with linen and come in a variety of sizes. A pebble urn is also available. After receiving the all-clear from her doctors last year, Davina said the prototype she made at her home in Wiltshire was suddenly in demand, which led her to launch the company earlier this month. ‘It took on a life and momentum of its own. I didn’t intend to make a business out of this, but there has been such a great response, that it would be selfish not to offer them to people. ‘When people see them, they think it’s a sculpture. Then it’s a shock to find out it’s actually a coffin. I’m happy to have made a piece of art that people can be buried in.’","Davina Kemble designed her own coffin after cancer diagnosis .

Andre Timberlake-Evans, 39, was diagnosed with incurable brain cancer this summer and has been told by doctors that he may be dead within the year. The groom, who will start chemotherapy in the next few days, was determined to walk down the aisle with his partner of 12 years - so he and his partner Maria, 31, organised their wedding in just two weeks.

The couple tied the knot on Friday in a moving ceremony at Hadley Park Hotel, in Telford, Shropshire and their son Max, 12, was their ring bearer. Today Mr Timberlake-Evans spoke of his pride at marrying his bride and said he hoped to at least make it to see his first wedding anniversary. He said: 'I am going to treasure every moment with my new wife. 'This situation puts things into perspective. First dance: The newlyweds took to the dance floor in front of 70 members of family and friends . Hand in hand: The couple show off their rings during the celebrations . 'It was kind of weird because you're having your happiest day of your life at the back of the mind there's the tick-tock of your body clock.

'Everybody is saying be positive but its like having a guillotine over your head and not knowing when its going to fall. 'But I did forget about that all for just one day.

'The time we have now is something to be grateful for rather than bemoaning what we don't have.' Mr Timberlake-Evans, a physically fit karate black belt, first began to notice something was wrong in June. He began to struggle to understand what people were saying, muddled up his own words and was constantly lethargic. The groom - who was forced to sell his window cleaning business following his diagnosis - said: 'One day I just went to thank a customer and couldn't speak. 'I thought the words but I just couldn't say them. I jumped back in the van and came home and just cried.'

The groom said: 'We believed everything was fine, I thought then - I want to marry you because life is too short. 'So I proposed, she said yes, and planned to get married in Sicily next year.' But at a follow up appointment the couple, from Oakengates, near Telford, received the news that Mr Timberlake-Evans had Grade four glioblastoma - the most aggressive type of malignant brain tumour.

The ceremony was held in front of 70 close friends and family and the couple's son Max proudly took on the role of usher and ring bearer. The bride's ivory dress was something borrowed from close friend Emma Bouyac, 31.

A bankrupt electronics retailer appears to have gotten caught up in the investor fervour for Twitter. Shares of Tweeter Home Entertainment Group Inc. rose as high as 15 cents Friday. That's up 1,400 per cent from Thursday's closing price of 1 cent. And trading volume skyrocketed to 14.4 million shares. Over the past year, the daily average was about 29,000, according to FactSet. Confusion: Shares for electronics store, Tweeter, rose 1,400 per cent because investors thought they were buying into social media company Twitter . The real Twitter: Twitter, which has its headquarters in downtown San Francisco, announced recently that it will for the first time offer shares to the public . Same same, but different: Richard Ketchum, Chairman and CEO of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Wall Street's halted the shares on Friday afternoon after noticing the public's mistake . Bankrupt: Tweeter closed down all its stores in 2008 after filing for bankruptcy . The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's industry regulator, said the shares were halted Friday afternoon because of a misunderstanding related to the ‘possible initial public offering of an unrelated security’. What could have gotten investors so confused? Twitter on Thursday offered investors details about its highly anticipated IPO and proposed the stock symbol TWTR. And Tweeter trades over the counter, under the TWTRQ symbol. The high-end electronics chain was founded in 1972 and had been based in Canton, Massachusets. It sold TVs, audio equipment and other electronics, but the stores disappeared years ago. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2007 and closed the stores in 2008. Tweeter's over-the-counter stock was worth 5 cents before trading was halted Friday. The San Francisco-based Twitter's stock won't be available for trading until the company actually goes public. That could be before Thanksgiving. Twitter has about 218 million, far fewer than Facebook, which has more than 1 billion. Revival: Tweeter's stock prices rose from 1 cent to 15 cents in one day before shares were halted in the afternoon . Flurry of excitement: Investors on Friday jumped ahead of the game and bought shares in Tweeter, thinking they were buying into Twitter, which has not been made public yet . But celebrities, from Oprah Winfrey to Britney Spears to President Barack Obama, are on it. And many TV networks and news organisations encourage people to follow their Twitter pages in order to start a conversation with viewers and promote their shows. Twitter said that it expects to raise about $1 billion in its IPO. Twitter finally laid itself bare in an 800-page filing released late Thursday as it prepares for an eagerly anticipated IPO. The . documents reveal that Twitter is planning to raise $1 billion for its . upcoming IPO. Celebs 'tweeting': The likes of Oprah Winfrey are avid users on the social media site Twitter . Oprah's twitter feed: The queen of TV has over 21 million followers . Twitter fan: US President Barack Obama is very active on Twitter and uses the social media tool on a daily basis . Obama's twitter feed: The President has over 37 million followers . Popular: Pop star Britney Spears is also an avid Twitter user and boasts over 32 million followers . With its initial valuation expected to be more than $10 . billion, those with a large stake in the company are expected to get a . huge payday when it goes public. But . the major stakeholders identified in the documents exclude one key . player - Twitter co-founder Biz Stone. Stone, who founded the company . with CEO Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams, isn't listed in the documents, . meaning he doesn't own enough stock to trigger legal disclosures. That suggests he likely unloaded at least a portion of his stake when he left the company in 2011. Jack Dorsey founded Twitter in 2006 when he was 29 years old. He now serves as chairman . As for Dorsey and Williams, the IPO will make them billionaires. Williams, Twitter's former CEO, owns a 12 percent stake in the company. If Twitter turns out to be worth at least $17.60 per share in the IPO, . Williams will be a billionaire at 41 years old. He remains on Twitter's . board of directors.","Tweeter shares rose 1,400 per cent on Friday going from 1 cent to 15 cents .

TV legend Terry Wogan has said female TV presenters shouldn't complain about not getting work later in their careers because they used their good looks land roles when they were young. The British broadcasting icon waded into the sexism on television row, saying women use their 'glamour' to make a name for themselves when starting out in the industry. He said that females who complain when the work dries up later should remember why they were given presenting jobs in the past, describing broadcasting as a 'visual medium'. Wogan's comments come after the Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman accused TV bosses of being 'very rude' to older female stars. The Shadow Secretary of State for culture was responding to figures which showed that eighty per cent of TV presenters over the gae of 50 in the UK are men. But Wogan, who has worked for the BBC for almost 5 decades, said it was natural for older woman to phased out as they age - even saying that stars of today such as Holly Willoughby and Tess Daly will be 'replaced' by the next generation of attractive presenters. Speaking in The Times magazine, he responded to Herman's outburst, saying: 'I think a number of the people who have been protesting originally got the jobs because of their glamour. 'I think it’s a little unfair, but it is a visual medium.' Warning: Wogan said that TV stars of today such as Tess Daly, above, will eventually be replaced by 'young attractive' women . When asked about the stars of today, such . as Willoughby and Daly, he said: 'They’ll be replaced by the next . generation of attractive female presenters.'

Alan Titchmarsh has said that women who complained about being sidelined on TV when they got older should stop 'whingeing' Speaking earlier this year, the TV gardener said: 'Men in television tend to last a bit longer at the end of their careers, but it is women who make hay at the beginning.' “They don’t complain in their early days when they are disporting themselves on sports cars.' Despite the row over sexism on TV being stoked by Wogan's latest remarks, the former voice of the Eurovision Song Contest said he hopes scandals such as executives pay and the Jimmy Savile affair will strengthen the public broadcaster rather than send it into decline.

Nearly two-thirds of A&E doctors say they are being pushed to the limit dealing with soaring numbers of patients. Many say there are certain times of the week when their own unit is unsafe because of  a lack of staff. And more than half say they regularly have to work overtime and potentially put patients at risk because they are so exhausted. A&E: A majority of staff has said they feel overstretched by patient numbers . A report by the College of Emergency Medicine has found that 62 per cent of doctors believe their current workload is unsustainable because they are under too much pressure. A total of 94 per cent of 1,077 consultants surveyed said they regularly had to work overtime to fill gaps in the rota. The College, which represents A&E doctors, warns that if the NHS does not either increase staffing levels, or try to reduce the numbers of patients, lives will be put at risk. The number of patients turning up in casualty has soared by more than a third in the past decade and there is concern many departments will reach breaking point this winter. This increase is partly down to the ageing population but has also been blamed on failings of GP out-of-hours services, leaving patients with nowhere else to go. Dr Taj Hassan, vice president of the College and an A&E consultant at Leeds Teaching Hospitals, said: ‘There is no doubt that the work that both senior doctors and nurses are having to do is unsustainable. We need significant changes to occur. ‘Some departments, it would be reasonable to say, are at times unsafe. That causes stresses for the whole system. 'Unsustainable': Almost all staff said they had to work overtime to keep the rota going (picture posed by models) ‘A failure to address these issues will compromise this ability and also further worsen the present workforce crisis affecting emergency departments.’ Last week figures from NHS England – the body which runs the health service – showed that the number of A&E departments missing waiting time targets had almost trebled in a year. Between July and September, 39 departments failed to ensure that at least 95 per cent of patients waited no more than four hours before being discharged or admitted to a ward. But during the same period the previous year only 14 units missed this target. The increasing pressure in A&E departments has meant fewer junior doctors are choosing to specialise there. Danger: The situation could put patients at risk . The College’s report also warned that increasing numbers of senior A&E consultants are moving abroad because conditions in the NHS are so stressful. This year 21 doctors who are members of the College had emigrated, up from just two in 2009. Some doctors have called for their contracts to be changed to make the job more attractive with higher rates of pay at evenings and weekends. But such suggestions have prompted fury among patient groups and campaigners who believe the profession is already paid enough. Dr Paul Flynn, chairman of the British Medical Association’s Consultants Committee, said: ‘Consultants working in emergency medicine face some of the most challenging, high pressured and stressful work environments in the NHS, often with limited resources and gruelling workloads. ‘The result has been fewer doctors choosing to go into emergency medicine and others leaving to work abroad, meaning existing consultants are working flat out to meet rising demand. ‘We urgently need to look at how we can make working practices in emergency medicine safe and sustainable to address this recruitment and retention crisis.’","Two thirds of A&E doctors said they are being 'pushed to the limit'

Former Lib Dem town councillor and town Mayor John Larsen denies charges of causing explosions and arson . A former Liberal Democrat town councillor who had an 'active interest in pyrotechnics' got a 'thrill' from setting off dangerous explosions in his own neighbourhood, a court heard today. John Larsen, 46, of Denbigh, north Wales, made his own Improvised Explosive Device (IED) which he used the blow up a Land Rover Discovery near his home Caernarfon Crown Court was told. The former town Mayor was also the man behind a string of explosions which had been causing fear in the community, the prosecution claim. Wyn Lloyd Jones, prosecuting, told a jury of six men and six women that after his arrest on April 19 this year, police found files on Larsen's home computer containing research notes about how to make explosives. One file was named 'gun powder mix' while another was named 'experimentation' - that file contained notes about charges, fuses, flash powder, 'rockets and shells,' and notes about various chemicals. The court was told that just days after the files were created, explosions were reported in the Lenten Pool area. Mr Lloyd Jones said the biggest explosion caused by the IED placed under the 4x4 car on March 24 this year sent metal shrapnel flying up to 90ft away from the blast zone. One ball bearing even lodged itself in the headboard of a nearby house. 'It’s fortunate indeed there was nobody in that bed,' Mr Lloyd added. The prosecutor said there was a 'strong and compelling' case against the defendant, who had been the Mayor of Denbigh in 1999 and was a member of the local Neighbourhood Watch. Mr Lloyd Jones told the jury: 'Not surprisingly there was media interest in what was going on and the . defendant voiced his opinions. 'The prosecution say the defendant was . responsible for these loud bangs and explosions and the damage to cars . and property. 'Because of the connections he had, he acted in breach . of trust towards the community in which he lived. He was arrested on . April 19 and since then there have been no further incidents. 'The prosecution don’t have to prove a motive but it is . highly likely the defendant was getting a thrill from what he was doing . and the attention these events were generating. Police at the scene of one of the explosions from a home-made device in the sleepy market town . 'Items recovered by . police from his home, from his computer, reveal a most active interest . on his part in pyrotechnics.' The court was told that members of the Denbigh community had been reporting plumes of black smoke late at night for a number of weeks and Audi, BMW and Renault cars had been damaged by fire. The series of smaller explosions apparently started in February and led up to the “main explosion” on March 24. Mr Lloyd Jones a neighbour of the defendant’s witnessed him going out at around 12.45am and 'bending down' by the vehicle 'as if to look under it'. The court heard that neighbours reported windows shaking and a bang sounding like 'the boom of a cannon'. 'It will come as no surprise to you that these events brought fear to the local community,' the barrister told the jury. He said that numerous residents had been reporting explosions and loud bangs to the police. 'The prosecution say that the defendant John Larsen was the person responsible for these loud bangs and explosions.' On one occasion in March Larsen had phoned police to report a loud bang 'appearing to be the responsible citizen in an attempt to put police off . the scent,' Mr Lloyd said. The court heard that Larsen had also been reporting his 'concerns' about explosions to the police. But the prosecutor said this was an attempt by the defendant to “put police off the scent” and that what he had down amounted to a breach of the community’s trust in him. Larsen, wearing a grey suit, white shirt and tie, is charged with three counts of arson, one count of causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause damage to property, one of count of causing an explosion with intent to endanger life or damage property and one count of possessing explosives. He denies the charges. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Former Lib Dem councillor John Larsen, 46, lived in Denbigh, north Wales .

And when – after almost 30 years – Open All Hours returns to our screens, viewers will see that stammering Albert Arkwright was true to his word. In plans for a Christmas special revealed yesterday, Sir David Jason will once again play Granville. This time, however, the one-time hapless grocery assistant is in charge. Family favourites: David Jason and Ronnie Barker in Open All Hours which will return to our screens at Christmas . The show will also feature Lynda Baron, 74, returning as unlikely sex symbol nurse Gladys Emmanuel. In the new episode, Arkwright – originally played by Ronnie Barker – has died and passed the shop on to his nephew in his will. A show source said: ‘The other characters will mention Arkwright, and his picture will be up on the wall of the shop.’ In the original series, Granville was often referred to as ‘young lad’, even though Sir David was over 30 when he played the role. Filmed in Doncaster, Open All Hours ran for 26 episodes between 1976 and 1985. Sir David Jason will once again play Granville in the Christmas special . It had 17million viewers at its peak and in 2004 was voted eighth best British sitcom in a nationwide poll. Much of the plot was taken up with Arkwright’s clumsy attempts to woo Nurse Gladys, including several unwanted attempts to climb up to her bedroom window with a ladder. The devious shop owner was expert at persuading customers to buy his products but was miserly with his own money. Every episode ended with Arkwright shutting up shop for the night and reflecting on the day. The one-off episode has been written by Roy Clarke, who penned the original series. Sir David, 73, said yesterday: ‘I am sure there is an audience out there who would like to see what Granville has been getting up to in the corner shop. It will be a great family show for Christmas and a fitting tribute to the legacy of Arkwright.’ Mr Clarke – who is also known for his success with Last of the Summer Wine and Keeping Up Appearances – added: ‘This has been fun – a great opportunity to work with David Jason again and to suggest how things at that corner shop might look today.’ Mark Freeland, the BBC’s controller of UK comedy production, said: ‘Having the chance to see Arkwright’s beloved shop again, now run by Granville, I hope will bring broad grins to lots and lots of faces at Christmas.’ In 2006, Arkwright’s original shop – a hairdressing salon which was converted for filming – was saved from demolition after a campaign group fought off council proposals to bulldoze it as part of wider regeneration plans. Popular: Open All Hours ran for 26 episodes between 1976 and 1985 and had 17million viewers at its peak . Two years later, it was put up for auction but failed to meet its reserve price. The BBC said it would start filming the new episode next month but had not yet decided whether it would be shot in the original location.","Sir David Jason will once again play Granville in the Chrismas special .

Hero: lollipop lady Karin Williams was among those honoured with an award at tonight's Pride of Britain Awards in London . A lollipop lady who dived in front of an out-of-control car to push a group of children to safety was among those honoured at an awards ceremony to celebrate the country's unsung heroes. Karin Williams was one of the courageous men and women recognised at the Pride of Britain Awards in London last night. But despite her honour, the mother-of-one still insisted: 'I'm not brave.' A host of famous faces including X Factor judges Louis Walsh and Nicole Scherzinger, Queen guitarist Brian May and Prime Minister David Cameron turned out for the awards ceremony, now in its 15th year, at the Grovesnor Hotel in central London. Among the other heroes honoured were Malala Yousafzai, the 16-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot in the head by the Taliban because of her outspoken views on education for girls; Matthew Wilson, a soldier who carried on fighting to save his colleagues despite being shot in the head; and three women who comforted dying soldier Lee Rigby after he was killed in Woolwich earlier this year. Mrs Williams,  50, from Rhoose in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, was hailed by actor and comedian James Corden for 'one of the finest acts of bravery' at a star-studded event in central London. She threw herself in front of a car when its 61-year-old driver lost control outside the school where she served as a lollipop lady to protect schoolchildren standing in the car's path. Describing the horrifying incident, she said: 'I don't remember pushing the children away. 'I just remember standing on the pavement with the children around me waiting to cross, and the next thing I knew I was on the ground with a paramedic leaning over me telling me not to move. Recovering: Mrs Williams is pictured recovering in hospital after extensive surgery following the incident, left, and managing to stand with the aid of a walking frame during her recovery, right . Courage: Karin's lollipop sits close to the crash site in the aftermath of the incident . 'I wasn't in pain. I was in shock.' Insisting that she isn't brave, she added: 'I did my job. It was pure instinct."" Brought onto the stage in a wheelchair, Mrs Williams was joined by a group of the children she saved, all of whom wore lollypop lady outfits and signs saying: 'Thanks Karin'. Mrs Williams was rushed to hospital where she went through an eight-hour operation on multiple injuries to her kneecaps, legs, elbow and shoulder. The hero lollipop lady managed to stand after being presented the award with her mother watching via video link from Germany - it was the first time she'd seen her stand since the incident. The event was backed by more than 100 stars and public figures including David Beckham, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, and Usain Bolt, the six times Olympic sprint champion and fastest man in the world. Beckham was shown presenting the teenager of courage award to Malala Yousafzai, the 16-year-old Pakistani teenager who was shot in the head by the Taliban after campaigning for girls' education. Survivor: Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban and survived, is pictured receiving her Pride of Britain Award from former England captain David Beckham . Pulling through: Malala - who now attends Edgbaston High School for Girls - was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after the bullet went through her left eye . He told her: 'You're an amazing young lady, a very special young lady, and your story has moved millions of people around the world. I'm so privileged and honoured to present this award to you.' Also honoured at the event - now in its . 15th year - at the Grosvenor House Hotel were RNLI rescue workers Paul . Eastment, 46, Chris Missen, 25, and Martin Blaker-Rowe, 33, who saved a . woman swept from a car in surging flood water in Umberleigh, Devon. Other unsung heroes who received awards included the families of the 96 Liverpool fans who died in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, in recognition of their long fight for justice. Award: Hillsborough Family Support Group member Margaret Aspinall picked up a Pride of Britain Award on behalf of the families of those killed in the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy . The award was collected by Margaret Aspinall, chairman of the Hillsborough Families Support Group. Eight-year-old Harley Lane, from Stockport, Cheshire, whose legs and arms were amputated to save his life after he suffered meningitis as a toddler, was also honoured. The schoolboy raised more than £1,000 earlier this year in a sponsored run using new prosthetic limbs. Harley was struck down by meningitis, which developed into deadly meningococcal septicaemia within hours. His heart stopped three times and doctors told Sam and her husband Adam that the only hope of saving their son’s life was to amputate both his arms and his legs . Clifford Harding, 36, from Birmingham, who volunteers as a youth worker with vulnerable children, won the Prince's Trust young achiever award. Passers-by Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, from Cornwall, Amanda Donnelly, 44, and her daughter Gemini Donnelly-Martin, 20, received a bravery award for their actions in the aftermath of the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London, earlier this year. His unit had been on a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines in Nahr-e Saraj when they came under enemy fire. By drawing the sniper's attention, L/Cpl Wilson won time for a helicopter to fly in and rescue the injured soldier. But his bravery almost cost him his own life, when a bullet struck his helmet, knocking him out. His horrified comrades feared L/Cpl Wilson was dead. A few seconds later they watched in astonishment as he groggily got to his feet, sprinted 50 yards across open ground and began returning fire at the insurgent. Fundraiser: Harley Lane, who almost died when he was struck down with meningitis as a toddler, was given an award. He is pictured here in 2010 .

His selfless actions allowed a helicopter to land and fly his stricken colleague, who had been shot in the leg, to safety. He earned a Military Cross for his efforts.

Nicholas Long stole £450 from Sainsbury's by scanning in his groceries as loose onions at the self-service checkout . As a fraudster with 20 super- market scams under his belt, Nicholas Long should have known his onions. But onions were precisely where the former international hockey player came unstuck. Long, 25, stole from Sainsbury’s 20 times in three months by fooling the self-service scanner into thinking more expensive items were onions. The debt-ridden City recruitment consultant was caught by a security guard who spotted that every item of his grocery shopping was being scanned as  loose onions. Long managed to save £450 using the ruse, which his own lawyer admitted to a court was ‘stupid’. He would take an item such as an avocado, which costs more by weight than loose onions, then place it on the scales of the scanner and declare it as the cheaper vegetable. The former under-19 hockey international dreamed up the scheme when he feared losing his job and his then-girlfriend became pregnant, the Old Bailey heard. He was also saddled with a £10,000 loan he had taken out on his father’s behalf. But his father’s firm failed soon after, leaving Long with the debt. Long was caught trying to get away cheaply with a £22 shop on August 7. He confessed to having repeatedly conned the same Central London store, which didn’t even sell loose onions, but had them on their standardised scanners. ‘It is a straightforward allegation that he went to Sainsbury’s and was seen scanning various items in at the self-service checkout’, said prosecutor Denise Murrin. Long used the scam 20 times in three months but was eventually caught by a security guard (file picture) ‘All items were being scanned as . loose onions, but the store does not sell loose onions. It was an . inexpensive way of doing his shopping.’ Long had previous convictions . for shoplifting, having taken a coat from John Lewis in 2010 and . attempted to pass off a bottle of champagne as bleach using the same . scam in 2011. He also stole a mobile phone from a handbag at a party in 2012. Angus Mathieson, defending, said Long . was driven by mounting debts and the fear of losing his job.  ‘It was a . stupid thing he has  done’, he said. ‘He was not getting a stupid . amount, not substituting champagne or anything like that, but just . getting an avocado and claiming it was an onion. ‘He had a good job at the time, but . committed an offence as he felt his job was under threat and he was . imminently likely to be made redundant. His girlfriend had become . pregnant and he was worried about money, because he had debts. ‘Part of the debts had arisen because . he had taken a bank loan out for his father, who needed money to help . his business along. He took out a £10,000 loan, but his father’s . business failed and he was saddled with the debt.’ Mr Mathieson said Long was not a . ‘manipulating and calculating thief’, and said he used his hockey . experience by voluntarily training young players at weekends. Long was given 180 hours community service after admitting fraud by false representation at the Old Bailey . But Judge Paul Worsley QC said Long . was a ‘persistent thief’ and warned him he was on the edge of a prison . sentence. He added: ‘Stealing from a supermarket is always serious. It . pushes up the cost of goods for honest members of the public who have to . pay to cover the cost of those goods lost through dishonesty. ‘You are an otherwise respectable . young man who achieved international honours in hockey, so it is sad to . see you before the courts.  But if you persist in taking other people’s . property, you will go to prison.’ Long, of Chatham, Kent, admitted a . single count of fraud by false representation. He was given 180 hours’ community service and ordered to pay £250 costs.","Debt-ridden Nicholas Long, 25, used the scam 20 times in three months .

Access denied: Crizotinib could benefit 1,000 patients a year but is deemed to lack evidence of benefits . Patients in England and Wales are being denied a lung cancer drug that will be available to hospitals in Scotland. Crizotinib can halt the advance of the disease for almost eight months on average. But the treatment, which costs £4,000 a month, has been deemed too expensive by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for use south of the border. However in the latest example of health apartheid, the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) is to give the green light for the drug to be used within NHS Scotland. Taxpayers in England and Wales will contribute to the general funding, but will not benefit from it. The drug, which was fast-tracked for use in the US last year, is designed for patients with a specific genetic mutation – called ALK positive – in non-small cell lung cancer. It is estimated that 1,000 patients a year could benefit from the drug. Trials suggest a doubling of time on average before the cancer progressed, up from three months to 7.7 months. Critics of NICE said the case for a fundamental overhaul was now overwhelming. This year alone, the body has failed to recommend any new cancer medicines from the 11 appraisals on which it has made decisions. At last week’s Tory party conference, David Cameron was forced to announce a two-year extension to the £200million-a-year Cancer Drugs Fund – which pays for treatments denied by NICE. Following the crizotinib announcement, Conservative MP Priti Patel said: ‘While this is tremendous news for cancer patients in Scotland, we once again have to question why NICE has rejected another cancer drug for use in England. ‘Improving the lives of cancer patients should be their key priority. England runs the risk of lagging behind Europe when it comes to research and development in life sciences and the use of pioneering, lifesaving drugs. ‘Reform of NICE so they put the improved access to treatments for patients first is vital so that we end what increasingly looks like a lottery when it comes to access for drugs.’ Rapid help: The new drug halts the advance for non-small cell lung cancer for eight months, more than double the time for chemotherapy . Professor Dean Fennell, chairman of thoracic medical oncology at the University of Leicester, said: ‘Given the high incidence of lung cancer in Scotland and the fact that many of these patients do not respond to chemotherapy, this is welcome news for Scottish patients. ‘However, this decision also shines the spotlight on a major issue facing UK cancer patients – that their treatment choices and potential outcomes are seemingly dependent on where they live.’ Ben Osborn, of drug-maker Pfizer UK, said: ‘This raises important questions about NICE and how, armed with the same information, it can reach an entirely different conclusion on the value of this medicine.’ Sir Andrew Dillon, NICE chief executive, said: ‘We were disappointed not to be able to add crizotinib as a treatment option for patients in England and Wales. Health services have to be confident that the extra benefit to patients justifies the price. ‘If we are not sure, we have to say so, in the interests of all those of us who expect the NHS to apply its resources equitably across all of the demands we make of it. ‘These judgments are frequently finely balanced and although NICE and the Scottish Medicines Consortium usually reach similar conclusions, it is inevitable that we will  differ from time to time.’","Crizotinib is a powerful new drug that can halt the advance of lung cancer .

A millionaire property developer who lost a planning battle over two £15,000 lion-topped gate posts has broken his collarbone as he attempted to remove them. Officials ruled that Edward Packer, 73, must remove the 12ft high Bath stone pillars outside his seven-bedroom home in the upmarket Sneyd Park area of Bristol - saying they were 'out of keeping' with the local area. Despite vowing to fight the 'unelected officials' who said they must be removed, Mr Packer lost his battle and was forced to take them down. High price: Mr Packer fell while trying to remove two £15,000 posts, topped with gold lions - pictured. Doctors have said he will be off work for six weeks . Row: Mr Packer, standing in front of the now empty plinths outside his Bristol home, was ordered to remove the posts by council officers who said they were 'out of keeping' with the area - the upmarket Sneyd Park . But as he dismantled the elaborate entrance a stone dislodged, causing him to fall and break his collarbone. Today, the property magnate said: 'I wish I had never built the pillars in the first place. 'But I am keeping them right here in my garden where they look beautiful. 'I managed to dislodge one of the stones with the jack hammer and I just went down with it. 'I still don’t know why anybody would complain about the pillars in the first place. 'There is nothing offensive about them. I can’t see why this sort of thing is so difficult for people and the council. It seems like everything is a trial with them. Former glory: The posts, installed by Mr Packer in Christmas last year, were 12ft tall and made from Bath stone . 'The doctors said I will be out for six weeks, but I can’t wait to get back to work. I don’t think I’ll ever retire.' Mr Packer moved into the expansive Cooks Folly, which was built in the 1840s, around 15 years ago. He erected the pillars outside his ten-acre plot just before Christmas. However, a few months after installing the pillars he received a letter from the council stating they were 'out of keeping' with the listed 1860s house and had 'no substantial public benefit'. But Mr Packer disputed the council’s claim and said the posts were an asset, which enhanced the road. At the time, Mr Packer said: 'An Englishman's home is supposed to be his castle. Adamant: Mr Packer said the posts were an added asset to his listed 1860s, seven-bedroom property and none of his neighbours objected to them . 'Well, I live in a castle but it doesn't feel that way after seeing these officials come up here and tell me to take my pillars down. 'I see the posts as an asset, which enhances the folly. I haven't met one person who doesn't like them.' Mr Packer instructed his lawyers to challenge the enforcement notice, a process he predicted would cost him £3,000. He added: 'I didn't realise we needed planning permission for the pillars. 'I found out afterwards that anything above 3ft needed permission so I applied for retrospective planning and they wouldn't have it. Copycat: The South Gate to Chepstow racecourse featuring a pair of stone lions that inspired Mr Packer's elaborate entrance, which he now has a month to remove . 'They won't even let me speak to a conservation officer. The council is so draconian, trees have more rights than people here. 'It is not like it is a block of flats I've just built, they are pillars at the front of a home in a quiet cul-de-sac. What harm will they do? Not one person has complained to me. 'I've lived at the home for 15 years and we've spent thousands restoring it. 'The councillors are a waste of time, they just rubber stamp what unelected planners say. The planners and politicians in Bristol are too busy fighting each other to help the people.' After a lengthy appeal process Mr Packer was finally given a month to remove the controversial pillars.","Edward Packer, 73, built lion-topped posts just before Christmas 2012 .

An illegal armourer has been jailed for a raft of firearms and drugs offences, including possessing two handguns and hundreds of bullets. Today at Maidstone Crown Court, Thomas Keatley, 28, of Sussex, was sentenced to nine years and four months after he was found with two handguns, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, gun-making equipment and a large quantity of cannabis. Keatley, arrested as part of an investigation by the Metropolitan Police Service's anti-gun Trident Gang Crime Command, was sentenced to five years for one count of possession of a prohibited weapon - a Forehand & Wadsworth double action .38 gate loading revolver. Weaponsmith: Thomas Keatley has been jailed for nine years for a string of firearms and drug offences . He also got three years for one count of attempting to manufacture a prohibited weapon, namely an improvised single shot pistol. These sentences are to run consecutively. Keatley, who pleaded guilty in June, was also sentenced to one year for one count of manufacturing ammunition and four months for one count of possession of cannabis, which will run concurrently. On the evening of Friday, June 7, Trident officers, with the assistance of MPS specialist firearms officers and Kent Police, stopped Keatley's vehicle in Dartford, Kent. He told officers: 'I know why you're here, it's in the glove box.' They opened it to find a Morrison's carrier bag containing the revolver, manufactured between 1871 and 1890. Three days later officers searched a garage linked to Keatley in Crawley, Sussex. Archaic: One of the guns in his possession was a 19th Century Forehand & Wadsworth double action .38 gate loading revolver . During the two-day search of the garage a partially-homemade firearm, a substantial quantity of ammunition and items connected with the manufacturing of firearms were seized. The haul included a complete, improvised brass-barrel, single-shot pistol with a 'blueprint' on how to make the firearm and hundreds of bullets and cartridge cases. There was also equipment to make home-made ammo. Other items seized included a pistol magazine, a rifle clip, four dummy cartridges, two bottles of smokeless propellant for loading into shotgun and handgun cartridges, bullet lubricant and assorted gun care products. The partially-constructed single shot pistol found in the garage . As well as hundreds of rounds of ammunition, Keatley had gun-making equipment and a large quantity of cannabis . A USB memory stick was also hidden in a block of wood. It contained 18 manuals, taken from the internet, on how to make both handguns and machine guns, as well as ammo. Bank account enquiries showed Keatley had purchased the majority of the firearms items recovered from the garage, including the reloading tools, online during the latter months of 2012 from stores in both America and the UK. Detective Inspector Paul Dorey, Trident Gang Crime Command, said: 'This is a significant result for Trident and the MPS together with Sussex and Kent Police. 'The seizure of the firearms, gun-making equipment and bullet cartridges has without doubt prevented lethal weaponry entering the hands of criminal networks operating in London and the Home Counties. An officer said the seizure has 'without doubt prevented lethal weaponry entering the hands of criminal networks operating in London and the Home Counties' 'On arrest, Keatley looked to hide behind firearm legislation to prevent prosecution. He stated he had purchased the antique revolver from a registered firearm dealer in Kent and as such, it was not a prohibited firearm. 'However when the weight of evidence was compiled against him he had no choice but to change his stance and admit to all firearm charges. 'This operation also demonstrates how Trident, and our police colleagues from around the UK, will work across both county and borough boundaries in order to arrest and place before the courts criminals who are involved in gun crime and gang-related criminal activity.' Chief Superintendent Paul Morrison, Sussex Police, said: 'This was a significant seizure which can only make the streets of the country safer. It demonstrates how police forces can work together to disrupt serious criminality. 'We were glad to assist our colleagues from the Met in the search and recovery of the firearms and equipment at the garage.'","Thomas Keatley, 28, was arrested as part of an anti-firearm police sting .

'When officers arrived it appears that those involved in the disturbance including Benji and his friends had left.' After the disturbance, Mr Bolsenbroek's friends and family took him back to his mother’s house nearby - where he began to feel very unwell. He was taken in a taxi to James Cook University Hospital, where his condition deteriorated very rapidly. Det Supt Donaghy said: 'Just minutes later, he was dead and that is where this complicated inquiry began. 'Yesterday, I had numerous officers carrying out investigations at various locations in Middlesbrough. 'We are also examining CCTV footage and have spoken to a number of witnesses and other people with information. 'My absolute priority is to get answers for Benji’s family who have suffered the rollercoaster of emotions with the birth of a baby, then the heartbreaking death of their son and brother.' A pathologist is carrying out a number of further tests to determine the cause of Mr Bolsenbroek's death, which is being treated as 'unexplained'.

Overdose: Ana Hernandez, pictured, was found dead with a huge amount of painkillers in her system . The death of a Spanish lawyer who died from a huge overdose of painkillers has been left a mystery after an inquest failed to reach a conclusion. Ana Hernandez, 32, was found dead on 28 June 2012 with a cocktail of drugs in her system, which exceeded recommended levels more than 100 times. She had moved to Barbburgh in Yorkshire to live with her fiancé, lecturer Darren Stott, and was found by friends in the house they shared. The inquest, held in Doncaster, heard that Mr Stott was a controlling partner, but that he was away at the time she died. As well as the drugs in her system, it was found that Miss Hernandez had also eaten a heavily-spiced stew shortly before she died. There was a suggestion that the tablets could have been ground up and added to her meal, but the coroner decided there was not enough evidence to justify a verdict of unlawful killing. Miss Hernandez had met Mr Stott, a 42-year-old who taught English at Leeds Metropolitan University, while he was on holiday in Gran Canaria in Marh 2011. The two fell in love and moved back to Mr Stott's home in England just under a year later. They got engaged and Miss Hernandez became pregnant around the time of the move. The inquest heard from friends of Miss Hernandez that she was a healthy and upbeat person who usually avoided taking any sort of medicine. It was also said that Mr Stott was a 'control freak' who followed Miss Hernandez's every move, and also that she allegedly confided to friends that she thought he might be trying to kill her with drugs. Ana’s semi-naked body was found on a bed in the three-bedroom bungalow next to a packed suitcase by family friends Carolyn and Geoffrey Telford. Prescription drugs, which Mr Stott had taken for his whole adult life, were found all over the house. The inquest heard that Mr Stott was in London on a course at the time the body was found. Toxicologist Dr Stephen Morley said . he could not say definitively that the tablets were taken at the same . time as the stew Miss Hernandez had eaten, but that it was possible they had been ground up. He said the concentrations of codeine, . tramadol and cyclizine alone could have killed her but in combination . they were 'very likely' to have caused her death. The inquest opened in December 2012, but was adjourned so that police could make further enquiries. In the wake of Ana's death, Mr Stott moved back to Gran Canaria, but fell ill there and collapsed in the street. He has since returned and is in a . hospital neurology unit in a 'very poorly state' with 'physical and . neurological difficulties' and was unable to evidence at today's . inquest. Fiancé: Darren Stott, pictured, was in London when Miss Hernandez's body was found . Speaking at an earlier hearing in December, Mrs Telford, 47, told the inquest: 'Ana told me Darren kept telling her to take the tablets and she said “he’s trying to kill me.” At the resumed hearing today, she added: 'She was looking forward to her . pregnancy and she refused even to take paracetamol for a headache. Her . attitude was not to take tablets when you are pregnant. 'She was close to her mum. I can’t think she would take her own life and do that to her mum.' She also said that Miss Hernandez had been complaining about her fiancé's drinking. Mr Telford, 56, said: 'Ana was . taking paracetamol and she felt Darren was trying to kill her. She told . me ""Darren is trying to kill me. He’s trying to make me take drugs."" He said Mr Stott followed her everywhere - even to the toilet - and compared the treatment to domestic abuse. Mrs Telford said at the resumed . hearing that Ana had complained to her about Mr Stott’s drinking and . that he used her as a taxi service. Miss Hernandez's brother Rafael, 42, told the . inquest: 'She was always positive and buzzing. In the week before she . died she was going on and on to mother that she had a big headache. 'I . was told it was due to her pregnancy and would pass. 'She was as fit as a fiddle and never . smoked or drank and was scared of medication. She didn’t like it at all. You had to tie her down to give her anything.' He claimed Mr Stott was a 'control . freak' and wanted to know Ana’s every movement - but that she seemed . happy and had no problems. Mr Stott said in a statement she was not enjoying her pregnancy and could not go to the gym which she enjoyed. She was reluctant to take any medication during her pregnancy 'She was fearful of harming the baby,' he said. New life: Ms Hernandez moved to the village of Barnburgh (pictured), South Yorkshire, to live with Mr Stott whom she met in Gran Canaria. Pathologist Dr Kim Suvarna said Miss . Hernandez had died within two to four hours of taking the tablets which . he thought may have been ground up. Det Sgt David Robertson, who led the police inquiry told the inquest: 'I’m unable to say beyond any reasonable doubt that he had anything to do with her death. He was in London at the time.' Coroner Nicola Mundy recorded an open verdict saying she had considered unlawful killing but there was not enough proof. Det Sgt Roberstson said: 'The question remains, how did high levels of medication get into Ana’s body?' He told the hearing that two previous partners of Mr Stott both described him as 'unusual', controlling and dishonest at times. Holiday romance: Ms Hernandez met Stott on Gran Canaria, pictured, while he was on holiday . He once sprayed a substance in the mouth of his then partner which left her sick on a plane after she complained of a migraine and he injected another partner in the leg with a pain killer when she too said she had a headache. Det Sgt Robertson said he would have liked to have talked to Mr Stott to have 'clarified certain points' but added: 'There was no evidence to suggest he would want to wish any harm to Ana.' Ms Mundy said she had discounted Ana accidentally taking too many tablets and she did not believe it was a deliberate act. Of unlawful killing she said: 'It has not been possible for the reasons told to me by Det Sgt Robertson for him to complete the investigations. 'It is unlikely that he is going to be able to interview potential key witnesses to shed more light on what might have happened. 'Becauase it is such a high burden of proof I need to have more evidence.' After the hearing Rafael Hernandez said: 'I don’t understand really. I don’t know whether Mr Stott is responsible.'

More runways will have to be built in the South East of England if the UK is to avoid aviation gridlock, Britain’s airports tsar said yesterday. Sir Howard Davies did not give a preferred option but the tone of his speech appeared to raise the odds of a highly controversial extra runway at Heathrow. He did not even mention in his speech the so-called ‘Boris Island’ plans for a Thames Estuary airport championed by London Mayor Boris Johnson. Sir Howard was detailing the provisional findings of his investigation into solving the problem of Britain’s bursting airport capacity. He said simply expanding regional airports such as Birmingham and Manchester would not provide a solution. Big issue: More runways will have to be built in the south-east of England, including potentially at Heathrow (pictured), Britain's airport tsar said today . Problem: Sir Howard Davies has said expanding regional airports such as Birmingham and Manchester would not solve the problem of aviation capacity . However, any recommendation of a third runway at Heathrow would trigger a huge political row. The Conservatives are against it while Labour’s policy is confused. Offically, . it is against major Heathrow expansion but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls . said recently he would prefer a third runway over funding the High Speed . 2 rail link. Sir Howard . said: ‘Our provisional conclusion is that we will need some net . additional runway capacity in the South East of England in the coming . decades.’ He stressed . that to rely ‘only on runways currently in operation’ would mean a . poorer service for passengers and could damage the economy. Sir . Howard, who chairs the Government’s Airports Commission, will deliver a . short-list of options at the end of the year, followed by a single . recommendation to ministers in 2015. He said the final recommendation could involve expansion at more than one airport – such as Heathrow and Gatwick or Stansted. Despite . failing to mention the ‘Boris Island’ options in his speech, he . insisted afterwards that the Thames Estuary plans were still on the . table. But he conceded that if it went ahead, the implication was that this would ‘certainly involve the closure of Heathrow’. New favourite idea: Boris has backed the four-runway 'Foster Island' (pictured) in the Thames Estuary airport, which would be capable of handling up to 180million passengers a year on the Isle of Grain in Kent . Elaborate plan: The Isle of Grain's proposed international railway station, which would include a service to Waterloo in 26 minutes . HEATHROW: Heathrow airport chiefs have published three options for a controversial new third runway to double . passenger numbers and ‘win the race’ to be Europe’s main international . airline hub. But they also spelled out the prospect of fourth runway . built after 2040. Residents reacted with fury to the blueprint that . would mean a sixth terminal T6 at Heathrow, and a seventh likely to . follow, threatening action in the High Court to halt it. Each . of the three third-runway Heathrow options will boost annual flights . from 480,000 to 740,000 a year  – more in keeping with its international . rivals - doubling passenger numbers from 70million to 130million a . year. 'FOSTER ISLAND': The inner estuary site on Kent's Isle of Grain is close enough to London to provide smooth and fast access by public transport, yet ideally located so as to allow take-off and landing over water and so impact on as small a population as possible. 'BORIS ISLAND': An airport on an artificial island off the Kent coast would remove all problems of noise pollution and give the airport the freedom to operate in whatever way it needed in order to maximise the UK’s connectivity and economic benefits. STANSTED EXPANSION: Developing a major four-runway airport at Stansted would have the attraction of building on existing infrastructure and being sited in a relatively sparsely populated region. GATWICK EXPANSION: Rival Gatwick has unveiled its own . controversial plans for a £9billion  second runway at Gatwick that could . treble passenger numbers to nearly 90million a year. But it too has . flown into turbulence from residents and environmental groups. Gatwick . bosses said a new runway in West Sussex, positioned to the south of the . current site, could be open in 2025 and could almost treble passenger . numbers but be less expensive and less noisy than an extra runway at . Heathrow. It would be part of a ‘constellation’ of three main airports . around London – instead of one major Heathrow ‘hub’. Sir . Howard said: ‘It is obvious that options for Heathrow are on the table. I don’t think that makes other options un-lookable at.’ But he added: ‘You also have to look at how the airline market would develop if you didn’t expand Heathrow.’ Sir Howard held back for now on ruling on his ‘preferred option’ for South East airport expansion. Fighting . to win his support are plans for a third and even a  fourth runway at . Heathrow, a brand new ‘Boris island’ in the Thames estuary – the two . competing and opposing  ‘hub’ airport options -  and extra runways at . Gatwick and Stansted. Sir . Howard, who chairs the Government’s Airports Commission which will . recommend to ministers where new runways should be built  was giving . his  ‘emerging thinking’ in a speech after taking evidence from . interested parties over the Summer. He . added that in environmental terms  it ‘would also almost certainly not . be the best solution in terms of minimising the overall carbon impact of . flights and travel to and from airports’. Sir . Howard said pressure on the UK’s busiest airports is likely to continue . to grow ‘even if we take a more conservative view of future aviation . demand than the DfT has in the past.’ This will lead to overcrowding at airports in the south east of England specifically. More importantly, this aviation gridlock will  happen even if demand for flights is less than expected because of pressures from the Government’s legally enforced ‘green’ climate change objectives. Sir Howard said it was difficult to see how the market alone could resolve the ‘imbalance’ between demand and capacity in the South East of England. And simply sending for flights to the regions would not be enough: ‘Regional airports are already serving their local markets effectively but it is difficult to see how they can absorb all the excess demand. The tools available to Government to influence the location of flights are also very limited.’ So taken together the taken together he concluded that such consideration ‘point to the need for new runway infrastructure in the south east of England in the coming decades’. He added: ‘A mechanism for managing the carbon impacts of aviation will be needed if the UK is to achieve its statutory carbon targets – just as it will in other countries. This is the case whether new runway capacity is provided in the South East or not.’ He added: ‘I would be interested in comments on the analysis I have set out today.’ The Commission is seeking responses on the emerging thinking and analysis set out in the speech by  October 31. The Airports Commission was launched in November last year but its final recommendations will not be implemented – if at all – until after the next General Election.","Sir Howard Davies says expanding Manchester and Birmingham not option .

Theresa May has reacted with fury as Downing Street agreed to the promotion of an ‘eccentric’ Liberal Democrat MP to the Home Office without consulting her. In the biggest shock of yesterday’s reshuffles, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg gave the Home Office job to Norman Baker, who wrote a book suggesting UN . weapons inspector Dr David Kelly was murdered by an Iraqi hit squad and . the incident was covered up by British security services . He has also said that he believes the death of former Labour foreign secretary Robin Cook may have been suspicious. Clash: The move to send Lib Dem Norman Baker to the Home Office has sparked a furious response from Home Secretary Theresa May . Jeremy . Browne, one of the leading figures on the Liberal Democrat right, was sacked to make way for former transport minister Mr Baker. Though he is widely seen to have been a hardworking and successful rail minister, senior Government sources expressed astonishment that Mr Baker had been promoted to a position in which he will be expected to work closely with the security services, having expressed such views. Mrs May is understood not to have been given any forewarning of his appointment. One official said it was ‘incredible’ that the Prime Minister had given it the green light and suggested the Home Secretary would freeze him out of key meetings. Though Mr Clegg is in charge of Lib Dem appointments to government, they all have to be signed off by Mr Cameron. Another Home Office source said as . rumours began to sweep Westminster of Mr Baker’s promotion yesterday: . ‘Is it true? Tell me not!’ One . senior Tory added: ‘Norman is an interesting character but let’s face . it, he is one of life’s eccentrics. To send him to work for Theresa at . the Home Office looks like an elaborate Lib Dem in-joke.’ Mr Baker himself is understood to . have wanted to remain at transport, where he had been masterminding . measures to ease the burden on hard-pressed rail commuters. Lib . Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander today defended the appointment, . insisting Mr Baker  had been 'an enormously effective minister in the . Department for Transport, he’s done a great job for the Government and . for the Liberal Democrats and I think he deserves this opportunity'. Mr Alexander told BBC Radio 4 the . move was part of the Lib Dems 'sharpening their campaigning edge' but . admitted he did not believe Dr Kelly was murdered. 'I . don’t think that. Norman’s views on that issue are well-explained. I . think he wrote a book on the subject. I haven’t read it.' Fired: Jeremy Browne, a leading voice on the right of the Lib Dems, was sacked as Home Office minister to make way for Mr Baker . Norman Baker took a year-long break from the Lib Dem frontbench to write his book The Strange Death of David Kelly. He claims the former weapons expert did not commit suicide, as the Hutton Inquiry concluded, but was instead murdered. He also raised doubts about the death of former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook. 'My own information strongly suggests that those behind Dr Kelly's death were Iraqi dissidents opposed to Saddam Hussein's regime and angry at Dr Kelly for undermining the case for toppling him. 'A well-placed source also told me that the British police or security services had been warned of a likely assassination attempt but were not in time to stop it. 'Did they then try to disguise the murder as suicide for reasons of political expediency?' *** . 'I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that this could not be suicide. 'The medical evidence does not support it and David Kelly's state of mind and personality suggests otherwise. It was not an accident so I am left with the conclusion that it is murder.' *** . 'Robin Cook was on Ministry of Defence land, I believe, when he died and certainly I have doubts over what happened.' He later added: 'I have never said that I think Robin Cook was murdered and have no reason to think he was.' Mr . Browne told friends he was furious at his dismissal, and there was . growing speculation that the Conservatives will now try to tempt him to . defect to their party with the offer of another Government job. The energetic Home Office minister, . who has been tipped as a potential future leader, angered some Lib Dem . colleagues by garnering more headlines than most of them during the . party’s annual conference last month. He suggested the veil should be barred . in certain situations and warned Mr Clegg against seeking to rebuild . support by listing Tory policies his party had blocked in coalition. Mr . Browne was also attacked by Left-wing colleagues after being left out . of the loop when the Home Office ordered an advertising campaign . involving vans driving round London telling illegal immigrants: ‘Go home . or face arrest.’ The . minister was instrumental in killing off Mr Cameron’s plans to introduce . a minimum price for alcohol, a move which would have added £100 to the . average family’s annual shopping bill. Mr Browne and Mrs May teamed up . to argue that the move would be profoundly illiberal. One . ally of the sacked minister said: ‘Vince Cable is tolerated however . much disloyal agitating he does from the left of the party, but it seems . Nick Clegg didn’t want to tolerate the slightest constructive criticism . from the right.’ Lib Dem sources insisted Mr Browne, . who also served the Government as a Foreign Office minister, had failed . to make an impact at the Home Office, where Mr Baker would be a more . ‘liberal voice’. ‘He might have looked good on Newsnight, but how many times did you ever hear him talking about his brief?’ said one. Mr Baker’s book, called The Strange Death . of David Kelly, which was serialised by the Daily Mail, examined the . theory that UN weapons inspector Dr Kelly, the source of a BBC story . alleging Tony Blair and his team ‘sexed up’ the case for war with Iraq, . did not commit suicide but was murdered. The Lewes MP, who is on the left of his party, said he was ‘convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that this could not be suicide’ and concluded an Iraqi exile group was responsible. Mr Baker has also been quoted in his local newspaper as saying: ‘Robin Cook was on Ministry of Defence land, I believe, when he died and certainly I have doubts over what happened.’ However, he later insisted this had been a ‘flippant comment’. Last night he said he would bring a ‘clear, liberal input’ to the Home Office and rejected the idea that he was a ‘conspiracy theorist’, saying people ‘tend to use the term when they want to insult people’. Mr Baker said Mr Clegg was ‘very well aware’ of his book about Dr Kelly’s death because he had taken a year away from the party’s front bench in order to write it. The Deputy Prime Minister also sacked Scotland Secretary Michael Moore and replaced him with Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael.","Biggest shock of reshuffle saw Jeremy Browne sacked from Home Office .

A businessman given a life sentence after being found guilty of murdering his wife and seven-year-old daughter in New Zealand has won an appeal after challenging his conviction in a British court. New Zealander Mark Lundy asked the judicial committee of the Privy Council - which sits in London - to analyse his case more than a decade after his conviction. A New Zealand jury concluded in 2002 that he had attacked wife Christine and daughter Amber with a 'tomahawk-like weapon' at the family home in Palmerston North, north of Wellington, New Zealand.

Crime scene: A New Zealand police officer stands in front of the house where Christine and Amber Lundy were found dead. Mark Lundy was charged and later convicted of their murder - but he has now won a retrial . Five judges - four from the UK Supreme Court plus a senior New Zealand judge - heard Lundy’s appeal at a hearing in the Supreme Court building in central London in June. They delivered a ruling today. The judicial committee of the Privy Council was the highest court of appeal for the British Empire and can hear appeals from cases originating in Commonwealth - or former Commonwealth - countries. Legal experts said the judicial committee of the Privy Council was effectively sitting as a New Zealand Supreme Court. They said New Zealand now has a Supreme Court but did not have one when Lundy was convicted. Judges unanimously allowed Lundy’s appeal and said another trial should be held. The judges said new evidence had emerged which cast doubt on the methods prosecutors used to establish the times of death. They said that, in the light of that, Lundy’s conviction could not be considered safe. Lundy, who is now in his mid-50s, was convicted of the killings in a 2002 trial in New Zealand and lost his initial appeal there. The council said he should remain in prison in New Zealand until his bail request can be heard there.","Five judges from the Privy Council unanimously agreed new evidence cast doubt on the conviction of New Zealander Mark Lundy .

The Cincinnati Police Department is embroiled in scandal after one of the force’s most visible officers was indicted Monday for sexting with a minor and setting up an unauthorized police substation. Darrell Beavers, 44, has been accused of receiving nude photos of a 17-year-old girl he was mentoring, as well as turning an apartment into a police sub-station without permission of the Cincinnati Police Department. Mr Beavers, a former NFL player, is well-known in the southern Ohio city for being a highly commended cop who a spends significant amount of time with inner-city youth as both a mentor and at a summer camp. Fallen: Darrell Beavers is accused of sexting a minor, destroying the evidence and establishing a rogue police substation . The young girl engaging in lewd contact with the disgraced cop was a member of the ‘Police Explorer’ program designed to pair teens interested in a career in law enforcement with seasoned cops who can show them the ropes, according to reports. An investigation into the 12 year CPD veteran’s conduct began last month after the teenager’s father discovered inappropriate messages sent between the Mr Beavers and his daughter, according to the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office. Investigators soon discovered the underage girl had sent nude photos of herself to the disgraced cop’s cell phone, which he destroyed after finding out he was under investigation, officials said. The once-respected cop was highly commended and often exceeded expectations in most performance metrics tracked by the CPD, according to WCPO. He went rogue: Mr Beavers set up his unauthorized CPD substation in the apartment pictured here, on the left . ‘He's been a generally good employee,’ Assistant Police Chief Lt. Col. James Whalen told the station, adding that ‘this is obviously very disappointing.’ A neighborhood liaison since 2010, Mr Beavers has earned 10 commendations during his time on the force, WCPO reported. ‘We’re very disappointed with this set of facts that brought rise to this situation,’ Mr Whalen told the Cincinnati Enquirer. The illicit contact took place between June and September of this year, officials said. Additionally, the investigation into Mr Beavers’ sexscapades also discovered an unauthorized CPD substation set up in an apartment complex on the outskirts of the city, authorities said. In place since earlier this year in Cincinnati’s East Price Hill neighborhood, the rogue outpost contained a mattress, bedding, food, lubricant, videos and a CPD-issued night vision camera, officials said. It looked legit: Both the complex manager and residents believed the outpost was on the up-and-up, it even had an official CPD decal in the window . Mr Beavers was able to secure the flop house for free by masquerading it is an official CPD substation, according to WEWS. He approached complex manager Marti Burcham in full uniform and even instructed her to place a CPD decal in the window, she told WCPO. ‘I saw him move stuff in, a computer and stuff like that, and he hung the sign on the window, so I thought it was all perfectly legit,’ Ms Burcham said. A resident of the grim-looking complex told WCPO she felt it was good for the area, but soon had reservations about its legitimacy. ‘When I first heard that there was going to be a substation in our complex, I thought it was a really nice idea,’ the resident said. ‘They were never there, it seemed like if there was going to be some police presence in the neighborhood at least they would be there on occasion,’ Kathy added. ‘An hour here and an hour there, but it really didn't appear that way to me.’ Highly-visible: Mr Beavers has spoken multiple times in the media about his outreach work with city youths . ‘A police officer commands, and should command, the respect of the entire community,’ Hamilton County Prosecutor Joseph Deters said in a statement. ‘When an individual police officer betrays that trust, it devastates the entire community which is why the Cincinnati Police Department and my office place the highest priority on these types of cases and will not tolerate this behaviour,’ Mr Deters added. The condemned cop faces six felony charges, including theft in office, tampering with evidence and four counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance, officials said. Making matters worse, Mr Beavers is known through the community for his work with troubled youth. The congenial officer has participated in Camp Joy, in rural Clarksville, OH, for several years, according to WCPO. He was even a youth camp counselor: Mr Beavers spent the past several summers at a camp for inner-city youths . Camp Joy pairs inner-city youngsters ages 10 to 12 with police officers with the hopes of getting to them before the streets do, a partnership that has existed since 1969, the station said. ‘Once they've reached a certain age, it's kind of hard to grasp, to bring them back,’ Mr Beavers told the station last year. ‘If you can save them now, you can talk to them now, you can probably reach out and be able to change a lot of their behaviour,’ he added. Mr Beavers told the station how many inner-city children who turn to a path of crime and drugs are often victims of their own environment, and that the camp teaches them to trust police. ‘You shouldn't be afraid of the police,’ said Mr Burcham. ‘We're the ones we want you to come to if you're in need, we want you to come to us.’ The former Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs player faces over eight years in prison if convicted. He is currently suspended without pay.","Darrell Beavers is a 12 year Cincinnati Police Department veteran .

Laura and Kevin Stier weren't even trying to get pregnant when they defied extreme genetic odds and conceived identical triplets without any help from fertility specialists. Now the couple have just brought their identical daughters home from the hospital after being watched for more than three . months after their delivery. There is a one in 8,000 chance of conceiving triplets naturally, and the while chances of identical triplets get even more slim and range from 1-in-60,000 to 1-in-2,000,000. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Out and about: Hannah, Norah and Lucy Stier left the hospital for the first time since their birth in mid June . Early birds: The girls were born tow and a half months early and weighed a collective 7 pounds . Twins are the most common form of multiple birth, and the whether a pair are identical or fraternal is determined by the number of eggs involved. When two separate eggs are fertilized during the same cycle, the children are fraternal twins while identical twins are produced when one egg splits into two embryos meaning that the two children would share genetic material. Triplets are more of a rarity, and can be the result of a variety of combinations. Two eggs can produce the twins as one would be fertilized on its own while the other splits into two, meaning that the threesome comes from one pair of twins and one individual embryo. The process of conceiving identical triplets comes from when one egg is used for all three, so the one egg splits into two embryos, and then one of those embryos splits again to produce the third child.

He said ""Yeah, I’m seeing three heartbeats,""' Mrs Stier recalled. 'I think my heart stopped,' the West Allis, Wisconsin mom told the local Fox affiliate. Mrs Stier was taken into the hospital in the beginning of June because one of the three babies appeared to be in distress. Ten days later, the three girls- Lucy, Hannah and Norah- were born. Their delivery came two and a half months early and the three babies had a collective body weight of less than 7 pounds.

Last week Apple successfully patented a staircase - and this week, rival Google is the latest firm applying for unusual rights - this time, to control how people pay for their dinner. Google's patent, called Tracking and managing group expenditures, was originally filed in March 2012 but has only just been made public. The files detail an automated system - most likely an app - that works out what everyone in a group owes towards a bill. It works out if there are any outstanding debts that still need to paid between individual members and can make payments, or transfer money between accounts, automatically. Google's latest patent attempts to make splitting the bill in a restaurant easier. The automated system works out what everyone in a group owes and if there are any outstanding debts that still need to paid between individual members and can make payments automatically . 'Often, people engage in activities as a group. For example, a group of friends may go on vacation together, plan an event together, or go to dinner,' the patent explains. 'When the group incurs a bill, typically one of the group members will pay the bill out of convenience and expects to be paid back by the other group members. 'However, some group members may not pay back their entire share of the bill or may forget and not pay back their share at all. 'This is unfair for the group member that paid the bill. Thus, there is a need in the art for an efficient way to track group expenditures and settle balances between group members.' There is already an app that uses a similar process, called Cover. According to the patent:  'Assume that a group is created to track and manage the expenditures of four friends while on vacation in Miami. 'While on vacation, one of the days only three of the friends go eat lunch at a restaurant because Friend 4 is not hungry at the time. 'The bill for lunch is $60 and Friend 1 pays the bill using a mobile payment service. 'Friend 1 adds the lunch as an expenditure of the group. When the form is presented to Friend 1 for the lunch, Friend 1 indicates that the lunch should be allocated to Friends 1-3. The lunch is not allocated to Friend 4 because Friend 4 did not participate in the lunch. 'Friend 1 provides the following amounts of allocation in the form: Friend 1 $25, Friend 2 $16, and Friend 3 $19.' It launched out of beta last week on iOS and is currently only available in New York. Once a customer sets up an account with Cover, they can check themselves into a participating restaurant. Before dinner, one person in the group tells the waiter they plan to pay using Cover. After dinner, the app splits the bill between how many people are in the group and the payment is made to the restaurant automatically, meaning the group can just leave. A default tip can also be specified, but the percentage can be adjusted depending on the service. This diagram shows how Google's system could work. It would keep track of who owes money to each member of the group, and how much. When a new bill is added, the system works out if any money needs to be deducted from previous debts before totalling up, and taking the payment .","Google's patent is called 'Tracking and managing group expenditures'
