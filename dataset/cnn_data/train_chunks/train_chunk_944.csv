"By . Pete Jenson . Follow @@petejenson . It’s being called ‘the Champions against the Champions’ as European Cup holders Real Madrid and La Liga conquerors Atletico Madrid get ready to face each other in the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday. Cristiano Ronaldo is back from two weeks rest, Gareth Bale is fresh from scoring twice for Wales, and despite the fact that Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas were sharing jokes with Atletico rivals Koke and Juanfran on Wednesday night as they watched Spain crash out of the Basketball World Cup together, the rivals are ready to rumble again on Saturday just three weeks after they clashed in a heated Spanish Super Cup double header. Both sides’ managers have seen their trophy winning teams partially dismantled this summer – Atletico by necessity and Real by presidential whim. In the rebuilding stakes, Carlo Ancelotti seems to be trailing Diego Simeone. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch... Cristiano Ronaldo returns for Real Madrid after a two week rest during the international break . Real Madrid have lost Angel di Maria to Manchester United in a £60million move . He has lost the energy of Angel Di Maria from his midfield three and is still contemplating moving Gareth Bale back there to compensate. The alternative is to persist with new man James Rodriguez alongside Toni Kroos and Luka Modric but the Colombian does not have the engine that Di Maria had and Ancelotti feels it makes for a midfield trio that leaves its defence exposed. Atletico also lost players in the summer but Simeone’s formation and tactics remain largely unchanged. Siqueira replaces Felipe Luis, Miguel Angel Moya replaces Thibaut Courtois in goal, and Mario Mandzukic and Antoine Griezmann replace Diego Costa – yes it’s taken two men for that job: Mandzukic to get the goals and Greizmann to stretch teams with his pace and provide the quick out ball for his team-mates. Sergio Ramos (left) and Iker Casillas watched Spain crash out of the Basketball World Cup on Wednesday . Carlo Ancelotti may decide to drop new boy James Rodriguez (right) for the Madrid derby . Gareth Bale returns to Real Madrid duty after a brilliant two-goal performance for Wales . Behind them Atletico remain the same rock solid two-banks of four team they were last season and they have also lost none of their efficiency from set-plays. Three of their last four goals have been scored from a set-piece including Raul Garcia’s strike from a Koke corner as Atletico drew the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Real Madrid 1-1. Ancelotti is well aware of the threat and saw his team defend poorly against Real Sociedad losing 4-2 before the international break. He will want greater concentration and possibly a better aerial presence, which is why an injury to right-back Dani Carvajal is not the worst possible news. Diego Costa (above) left Atletico Madrid for Chelsea but replace him with Mario Mandzukic . Atletico don't seem to have been too unsettled by the loss of last season's stars such as Thibaut Courtois . Diego Simeone was given an eight-match ban for conduct in Spanish Super Cup last month . It will give Ancelotti the chance to put Sergio Ramos at right back and bring Raphael Varane – excellent for France against Spain’s Diego Costa last week – into the centre of defence. Fabio Coentrao will be the other change at the back, coming in for Marcelo who has just returned from a 9,000 mile round trip from Madrid to the US for two friendlies in which he didn’t play a single minute. ‘These derbies are more evenly balanced than they used to be’ says Atletico Madrid full-back Juanfran. ‘Real Madrid supporters look at us differently these days’. For 14 years Atletico failed to beat their wealthier neighbours but Diego Simeone has drastically changed the football landscape in the Spanish capital. Diego Godin celebrates scoring the opening goal of the Champions League final against Real . Real Madrid suffered a 4-2 defeat against Real Sociedad in their last La Liga outing . In the rebuilding stakes, Carlo Ancelotti (right) seems to be trailing Diego Simeone . And don’t let any Atletico Madrid fans hear you say: ‘Yes but are they a wonder season wonder?’ It was TWO years ago that Atletico beat Real in the Spanish Cup final and at the end of that season their ability to ‘go again’ was questioned. ‘Go again’ they did, winning not the cup but the league itself. As reigning champions and having started the season without the doubts that seem to be affecting Real, they will not be intimidated in the Santiago Bernabeu – despite the 81,000 cauldron that awaits them. Their measly allocation of 250 tickets continues to be taken up slowly so there will be no red and white wall of noise and neither will Atletico have Simeone prowling the touchline. After clipping the fourth official round the back of the head in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup he is still serving part of his eight-match ban. Real Madrid defeated Atletico to win the 2014 Champions League final this summer . Diego Simeone (right) has replaced Diego Costa with Mario Mandzukic (left) and Antoine Griezmann . His assistant German Burgos will take his place and like his superior he is no stranger to derbies having played in goal for Atletico for four years. He saved a Figo penalty with his nose in the 2003 meeting at the Bernabeu and then conceded one of the fixture’s fastest goals a season later when he was beaten by Ronaldo after 14 seconds. The other Ronaldo – Cristiano – is winding himself up ready to be unleashed on the Champions. Kept out of Real Madrid’s 4-2 defeat to Real Sociedad and Portugal’s miserable week of international woe, he returns to the team and can edge closer to a few more Madrid milestones. Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) has scored 255 goals in 250 games for Real Madrid . He has scored 255 goals in 250 games for Madrid including 178 times in La Liga. There are only three players between him and all-time club top scorer status with leader Raul just 68 goals ahead – having played 11 seasons more. No wonder when asked if he was worried about the team’s poor start to the season this week Ancelotti told Italy’s Il Giornale: 'I can rest safe in the knowledge that we have two very important things: a group of very professional players, and Ronaldo who scores a goal a game.'

"By . Patrick Collins . Roy Hodgson has been manager of England since May 2012. He is a figure who divides opinions; for some he is a quiet voice of sanity amid the prevailing madness, for others he is a bland, uninspiring presence. All agree, however, that Hodgson is an instinctively courteous man who controls temper and tongue whatever the provocation. Now, it seems, we shall all have to think again. The eruption occurred during his spirited defence of England’s midweek performance against Norway. Fuse: Roy Hodgson hit out at the press following the 1-0 win over Norway at Wembley on Wednesday . Boss: Hodgson saw the positives in the performance, complaining that the media are always turning the knife . His critics having scented blood during the World Cup campaign, Hodgson believes that they are seizing every chance to turn the knife. The sparking point was a questioner’s tendentious use of a statistic. The manager snarled. ‘I can’t turn the clock back,’ he said. ‘But what I can do is analyse what I have seen and judge that through my eyes and not because someone is telling me: “Well, you only had two shots at goal.” Because, for me, that is absolute f****** b*******. I’m sorry.’ From many managers, such an outburst would be unremarkable (not for nothing was Joe Kinnear known as ‘JFK’ during his brief, inglorious spell at Newcastle). But from Hodgson, at an on-the-record Press conference, it was startling. And it may come to be seen as the turning point in his England career. For the past two years, Hodgson has been at pains to please all and sundry. He has appeared determined to give no offence, to offer no harsh or contentious opinions. His approach has been scrupulously even-handed: ‘On the one hand; but, then again, on the other.’ As a result of that — and of his admirable reluctance to indulge in touchline histrionics — he has been accused of lacking ‘passion’, that preposterously over-rated quality which English football holds so dear. Now some of his colleagues would have amended that impression by courting the media. It is a well-trodden path; the gushing phone call, the chummy text, the flattering implication that the scribbler’s opinion is warmly valued. Why, there are managers who have built their careers upon such methods, but Hodgson is not of that number. So far as I am aware, he has bestowed no favours, played no favourites, incurred no obligations. Which leaves him in a remarkably strong position. Reaction: Wembley was half-empty on Wednesday night after a disappointing World Cup campaign . Had enough? Midfielder Jack Wilshere (right) also hit out at criticism of his personal performances . His England contract runs through to the European Championship finals of 2016. The qualifying hurdles are Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and San Marino; barring calamity, all should be cleared with something to spare. Back then: The press wanted Bobby Robson out after a 1-1 draw with Saudi Arabia in 1988 . The pool of English talent is shallow, since our game prizes domestic greed above international need, but as Hodgson argued the other evening, we have an elite corps of players which is clearly capable of something significant. The manager cited the likes of Jordan Henderson, Jack Wilshere and Daniel Sturridge. He added the substitutes Fabian Delph, Danny Welbeck and Calum Chambers, and mentioned absentees Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley and Adam Lallana. He paid particular tribute to the dazzling young Raheem Sterling, aware that his main problem there will involve management of expectations. Had he been able to identify some adequate central defenders, his case might have been even stronger. But no matter: the point was well taken. So the scene is invitingly set, and I suspect that Hodgson is in the mood to answer the invitation. Already, he has brought qualities of dignity and intelligence to the task, and all the signs suggest that his players appreciate his methods. Likewise the public, whose loyalty has been unstinting. A half–empty Wembley provoked many a glib sneer last week, and yet, as an expression of public optimism, a gate of 40,000 was quite staggering. The next move lies with the manager, and there is at least one encouraging precedent for his situation. Change in mood: Robson on the bench with England boss in 1988, before his fortune changed . Heroes: Robson then took England to the World Cup in Italy in 1990, putting in a passionate performance . Twenty-six years ago, Bobby Robson’s England team reached the Euro 88 finals, where they were beaten in the group stage by the Republic of Ireland, Holland and the USSR. The ensuing abuse was savagely hysterical. The side came home and played out a sterile draw in a friendly with Saudi Arabia, whereupon one crass headline bellowed: ‘In the name of Allah, go!’ Two years later, Robson led his team to Italia 90. Improving game by game, they reached the semi-finals, where they lost a cruelly close battle on penalties to West Germany. Robson was established as by far the best and most successful England manager since Sir Alf Ramsey, but he never forgot the pain he had suffered, and how he had coped. Another era: Paul Gascoigne, one of England's finest performers at Italia '90, playing in the semi-final . Years later — knighted, feted and installed as a national treasure — he told me how he had decided to be his own man, to stand or fall by his own decisions. Then he said something profound: ‘I remember thinking: “If I’m going to have regrets, then they’ve got to be for the things I did, not for the things I didn’t do.” Does that make sense?’ He was a wise man, was Bobby, and it was wisdom born of painful experience. Roy Hodgson has suffered a little of the pain while accumulating a similar store of experience. He has been offered the chance to become one of England’s most memorable managers. Now he must seize it. Slotted: Wayne Rooney puts away the penalty - the only goal of the game - in the sterile win against Norway . Don’t worry Wayne, it’s just a strip of cloth . The choice of Wayne Rooney as England captain was not universally popular. Some worried that the responsibility might prove inhibiting and that his form might suffer. In the event, the armband made not a scrap of difference. Rooney worked as hard as ever in the match against Norway but his touch was wayward, his efforts unproductive and a game which once came so easily to him now seemed a murky mystery. Just a title: Rooney captained England on Wednesday night, but the armband made no difference . When he departed, in the 69th minute, he appeared uncertain what to do with the band. He looked around, spotted Gary Cahill nearby and hastily passed it on. It would be good to report that Cahill was inspired by his call to the colours. In truth, he simply carried on making the same mistakes he had been making all evening, before thrusting it at Joe Hart with six minutes remaining. The transactions evoked images of harassed mothers handing over a screeching infant. There are those who cling to the caricature of captaincy, the peculiarly English myth of the fist-shaking skipper, rallying his troops by the force of his personality. That delusion perished when Roy Race hung up his boots at Melchester Rovers. Put it in: Rooney in training ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland . We now accept that the captain is required to predict the toss of a coin and make a choice of ends. But we resist pretentious attempts to mystify the office. For we know that the reality of football captaincy can be quite different. And that it can involve three embarrassed young men, hurriedly exchanging a shabby bauble. Because convention insists that somebody has to be nominally ‘in charge’; his authority signified by a strip of cloth. Gatlin the problem for Greg . Greg Rutherford, Britain’s Olympic long jump champion, fears for the future of track and field. With competitions dwindling and public interest fading, he calls for urgent action. ‘There has to be a way of showcasing athletics to make it more fun,’ says Rutherford. He believes there should be more street events, such as Gateshead’s excellent Great North CityGames, and he makes a strong case. Accessible: Greg Rutherford believes their should be more street events like the Great North CityGames . But on the very day that he expressed his worries, a cheat named Justin Gatlin ran the 100 metres in 9.77 secs, the fastest time of the year. Gatlin is free to compete, despite having served two bans for the use of illegal drugs and his presence is an unacceptable disgrace. For until the public can believe what it is watching, honourable men like Rutherford will be cruelly handicapped in their struggle to save a great sport. Triumph: Gatlin recorded a years best time of 9.77s in Brussels on Friday evening . PS . When Lewis Hamilton was asked why his Mercedes team-mate, Nico Rosberg, was so desperate to beat him, he answered: ‘It’s because I’m good-looking, man. I’ve got the car, I’ve got the girlfriend. What can I say?’ There are times when I wonder why I find it impossible to take Formula One as seriously as it takes itself. I suspect that the self–effacing Hamilton has just supplied the answer.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A man says that he had sex with his sister-in-law in order to help her conceive and now she is suing saying that he sexually assaulted her. Ted McCullough says that he had sex with his sister-in-law Adrienne Mesko, and that she is now claiming he sexually assaulted her because she doesn't want to admit to her family that she wanted to have sex with him rather than receive IVF treatments. Mesko is now accusing him of sexual assault, a claim that McCullough claims is false and has filed a $7million lawsuit to fight. Undercover lovers: Adrienne Mesko (left) allegedly asked her brother-in-law Ted McCullough (right) to have sex with her so that she could get pregnant because her husband is infertile . According to The New York Post, McCullough says that he and Mesko had a two-day tryst in Hyde Park, an area of upstate New York in Duchess County where she lives and he has a weekend home. The date of the alleged encounter is unclear, but court documents lay out other various details. At one point, 'she pulled her naked legs up in a crab-like position to increase the chances of conception. She then stated to him, ""Thank you, I know you are doing me a favor.""' She did not conceive after their relations and is not pregnant. Mesko's husband, Gregory Chiaramonte, is the brother of McCullough's wife Deirdre Chiaramonte. McCullough apparently was willing to have sex with his wife's sister-in-law out of respect for his brother-in-law. He apparently thinks that Gregory would make a 'fine, responsible and upstanding father'. Angry: Deirdre Chiaramonte (both left and right) has filed for divorce from her husband, Ted McCullough, after he allegedly had sex with Deirdre's brother's wife . McCullough's wife does not apparently think the same about her own husband, however, as Deirdre  has filed for divorce. The couple, who have two children, are reportedly trying to work things out. Chiaramonte works as the director of The Tina Santi Flaherty Rehabilitation and Fitness service at The Animal Medical Center in Manhattan, while her husband is a partner at a law firm. According to the biography on his website, McCullough 'handles complex commercial cases including class action work, contract and commercial suits, products liability, intellectual property, environmental and employment disputes' at the firm McCullough Ginsberg Montano & Partners.","Ted McCullough allegedly had sex multiple times with his sister-in-law Adrienne Mesko .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Boko Haram's leader has declared an Islamic caliphate in a northeast Nigeria town seized by the extremist militants earlier this month. Abubakar Shekau, the terrorist behind the kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls four months ago, made the statement during a video which shows a group of prisoners being shot with assault rifles as they lie in a ditch. He declared that Gwoza, in Borno State, now has 'nothing to do with Nigeria' and said 'by the grace of Allah' they will not be leaving the town. Scroll down for video . Abubakar Shekau, the terrorist behind the kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls four months ago, said the town of Gwoza now has 'nothing to do with Nigeria' while declaring a caliphate in the north of the country . The rebel leader of Boko Haram made the statement during a horrifying video which shows soldiers shooting a group of prisoners on the floor . 'Thanks be to Allah who gave victory to our brethren in (the town of) Gwoza and made it part of the Islamic caliphate,' he claims during the 52-minute video. 'By the grace of Allah we will not leave the town. We have come to stay,' said Shekau, who has been designated a global terrorist by the United States and sanctioned by the UN Security Council. The United Nations humanitarian office (OCHA) earlier this month confirmed reports that Gwoza was under rebel control. Boko Haram is also believed to be in control of other areas near the seized town in southern Borno, as well as large swathes of territory in the north of the region and at least one town in neighbouring Yobe state. Mapping the precise areas which have fallen into Islamist hands is nearly impossible. The footage shows them lying helplessly in a ditch before the assault rifles are aimed at their heads . There are few humanitarian workers on the ground in the northeast, travel is dangerous and the region, which has been under a state of emergency since May of last year, has poor mobile phone coverage. Experts have described Boko Haram's gains in recent weeks as unprecedented, saying the group was closer than ever to achieving its goal of carving out a strict Islamic state across northern Nigeria. But many analysts believe the military has the capacity to reverse the insurgents' advance. Soldiers this week refused to deploy to Gwoza without better weapons in an apparent mutiny.

"By . Snejana Farberov . An innocent joke about actress Megan Fox had prompted then-17-year-old Miami boy to fatally shoot his father in the head, a jailhouse informant testified in court Tuesday. Jason Beckman, now 21 years old, is on trial for allegedly murdering South Miami city commissioner Jay Beckman, 52, in April 2009 while he was in the shower. Initially, Jason was charged with manslaughter after telling police he accidentally discharged the 12-gauge Browning Citori shotgun by tripping over it. Scroll Down for Video . Patricide: Jason Beckman, 21 (left), is on trial or allegedly murdering his father, South Miami city chief Jay Beckman, 52 (right) in April 2009 . Murder weapon: Jason Beckman claimed that he went to show his father this 12-gague Browning Citori he had just assembled but slipped and fell, causing the shotgun to fire . Gory: The city chief was shot at a very close range in the shower, the blast nearly blowing his face off and dousing the room with blood (pictured top left) However, the charge was later upgraded to first-degree murder when it emerged in the course of the investigation that the teen had admitted to a neighbor that he planned one day to kill his father with the shotgun. In court Tuesday, Beckman’s inmate Michael Nistal told jurors that just before the deadly shooting, Jason asked his father what he thought about Hollywood starlet Megan Fox. Final straw: Jason's inmate testified that the . teen told him that just before the shooting, he asked his father what he . thought of actress Megan Fox, and Mr Beckman responded that 'he . wouldn't know what to do with that' 'His father told him he [Jason] wouldn’t know what to do with that,' Nistal recounted to the jurors, according to the Miami Herald. The seemingly innocent comment uttered by Jason's father, whom he allegedly hated and talked about killing for years, pushed the 17-year-old over the edge, according to the prosecution. ‘So he went and got a shotgun and blew his head off. He missed his head and shot his face and part of his neck,’ the inmate said. Nistal added that Jason told him he then poked his father's body with the weapon to see if he was still alive. A photo taken of the teen after his arrest shows him standing barefoot in a grey T-shirt with no visible signs of blood on it, which the prosecutors say suggests that Jason made no effort to come to his father’s aid as he lay dying in the blood-spattered bathroom. Jason Beckman’s defense team, however, insist that the shooting was accidental. Following his arrest, prosecutors say the teenager came clean about the killing to inmates, including Nistal, at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. Nistal is serving a seven-year sentence for a burglary spree that culminated in a deadly high-speed chase. The convicted felon told the court that Beckman planned to use insanity or self-defense to beat the murder rap, and also talked about killing witnesses after the trial. Crime scene: The deadly shooting happened inside the Beckmans' South Miami home on Easter Sunday . Evidence: This photo taken after Jason's arrest shows him in a grey T-shirt with no visible signs on blood on it, which the prosecutors say suggests that he made no effort to come to his father's aid . Jay Beckman, a South Miami city commissioner, was found dead in his Florida home April 12, 2009, after his son called the authorities to say he had accidentally killed him. During questioning after the killing, Jason told police that he had a 'love-hate' relationship with his father, who had been raising him alone since his mother died from cancer in 1998. Jason told police he went to show his father a shotgun he had just assembled but slipped and fell, causing the shotgun to fire, reported the Miami Herald at the time. In her opening statement last Wednesday, prosecutor Jessica Dobbins said that Jason kept a 'hit list' of people he did not like on a piece of notebook paper, and that his father's name was at the top, CBS Miami reported. Defense attorney Tara Kawass responded to the allegations by saying that Jason's outbursts, in which he talked about wanting to kill his father, could be attributed to his Asperger's syndrome - a mild form of autism that caused him to say outlandish things and speak out of turn. Hit list: Prosecutors say for years Jason had been talking about killing his father, whose name was at the top of a list of people he did not like . Kawass added that his list-keeping was a form of coping with his condition, which made it difficult for him to make friends. But the attorney insisted that while her client was socially awkward, he was never violent or aggressive, and he did not pull the trigger on purpose on Easter Sunday in 2009. During testimony on Friday, Jason’s former classmate Jennifer Kaiser told jurors that in the eighth grade she saw the teen bring gun magazines to school, and he once told her that she was on his list, CBS Miami reported. Armando Torres, another one-time schoolmate of Beckman’s, also testified that he heard him say on multiple occasions that he wanted to kill his father.","Jason Beckman, 21, charged with first-degree murder in shooting death of his city commissioner father, 52-year-old Jay Beckman, in April 2009 .

"By . Sean Poulter . The next time you buy chicken or eggs from Tesco,  they may come from birds fed genetically modified soya. The supermarket chain yesterday abandoned its 11-year commitment not to sell poultry reared on the controversial GM feed. The original controls were put in place to reflect the concerns of shoppers, who question the impact of GM crops on human health and the countryside. Tesco, Britain's biggest seller of fresh chicken and eggs, is dropping a ban on GM feed for its birds which dates back 11 years . Tesco, Britain’s biggest seller of fresh chicken and eggs, claims the U-turn has been prompted by its farmers and their suppliers, who say they are finding it increasingly difficult to source non-GM soya. This suggests the diet of families in the UK is effectively being controlled by US biotech companies responsible for creating GM crops. None of the chicken or eggs produced from birds given this ‘Frankenstein food’ diet will be labelled as such, leaving customers in the dark. Yet a survey conducted by the Government’s Food Standards Agency last year found two in three people believe meat, eggs and milk produced from animals given a GM diet should be labelled. Peter Melchett is policy director at the Soil Association, which  supports organic farming. He accused Tesco of ignoring the wishes of customers and said it was simply wrong to claim it was  difficult to get non-GM feed. ‘Tesco are ignoring the overwhelming majority of the British people,’ he said. ‘Shamefully, Tesco are planning to keep their use of GM feed secret from their customers.’ He added: ‘Tesco are also wrong about the availability of non-GM animal feed. They have swallowed the line being pedalled by multi-national, industrial farming companies that non-GM feed is getting scarcer. In fact, in Brazil alone, there is enough non-GM animal feed to supply the whole of Europe.’ There is some dispute as to whether animals fed a GM diet are changed as a result. The Food Standards Agency says that the DNA from GM soya is not present in the meat of animals fed on it, nor in products such as eggs or milk. The supermarket said the change does not mean that it will be introducing GM ingredients across its food range . But critics claim scientists have shown that fragments of genetically modified DNA, at least,  are present in the resulting food. Tesco’s announcement came from  group technical director, Tim Smith, who was chief executive at the FSA during a period when it was perceived as being pro-GM. The store said customers who want to guarantee meat and eggs from animals given a non-GM diet can choose to buy organic. Mr Smith wrote on the Tesco website yesterday: ‘Over recent weeks UK poultry and egg suppliers have been telling retailers that it is increasingly difficult for them to guarantee that the feed they use is entirely GM-free, for two reasons. First, soya is the best source of protein to feed livestock. ‘And as soya producers are increasingly turning to GM soya, it means they are producing less non-GM soya, so there simply isn’t enough non-GM feed available. We could not continue with a promise we cannot be sure it is possible to keep and we want to be up-front about the changes we are making.’ Morrisons and Asda have already dropped their own bans on GM feed. Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury’s are still refusing to use GM for their chickens. Last night Tesco insisted that it takes full responsibility for lifting the ban. A spokesman said: ‘This is our decision, made after consulting suppliers. We are not blaming suppliers or farmers.’","Controls were put in place in order to reflect concerns of shoppers .

"By . Christopher Torchia, Associated Press . The chief prosecutor in Oscar Pistorius' murder trial said on Thursday that the double-amputee athlete's lawyers have floated more than one theory in a dishonest attempt to defend against a murder charge for his killing of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel made the allegation during final arguments in the sensational trial in a Pretoria courthouse, where the fathers of the Olympic runner and Steenkamp, a model and television personality, were in court for the first time since the trial began in early March. They sat at opposite ends of a long bench in the gallery. Nel said a criminal trial was a 'blunt instrument for digging up the truth' but that he was confident of his case. He then said defense lawyers had argued that Pistorius acted in self-defense, fearing an intruder was in the house, but also raised the possibility that the once-celebrated athlete was not criminally responsible, accidentally shooting Steenkamp through a closed toilet door because he was 'startled.' 'It's two defenses that you can never reconcile,' Nel said. VIDEO Scroll down to watch: Final arguments have begun in Pistorius murder trial . Oscar Pistorius sits in court as his murder trial reaches the final arguments . The double-amputee athlete is accused of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . Oscar Pistorius' lawyers have been accused of floating 'two defences' by the prosecution . The prosecution has argued that Pistorius intentionally shot Steenkamp before dawn on Feb. 14, 2013 after a quarrel. The defense has previously contended that he fired by mistake, thinking he was about to be attacked by an assailant in the toilet and that Steenkamp was in the bedroom. In addition to the murder charge, Pistorius faces three separate gun-related charges, one of which stems from his alleged firing of a shot in a crowded restaurant called Tashas in Johannesburg, months before he killed Steenkamp. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. On Thursday, some of the state's written arguments as well as transcripts of past testimony appeared on screens in the courtroom. One section questioned Pistorius' defense case: . 'Is it putative self-defense? Is it an act of sane automatism? Did he have criminal capacity to act? Or was it all an accident as in Tashas Restaurant where he had the gun in his hand and it purportedly discharged itself?' Because South Africa has no trial by jury, Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide with the help of two legal assistants if Pistorius committed murder, is guilty of a negligent killing, or if he made a tragic error and should be acquitted.

"By . Glenn Hoddle . Louis van Gaal has made quite an impact in his first few weeks in English football. His strength of personality and confidence in himself are remarkable. During the World Cup, I happened to be staying in the same hotel as the Dutch national team in Rio de Janeiro and I had the opportunity to chat with him and to see at first hand the influence he had over his players and the team spirit he created. And in the run-up to last weekend, everyone seemed to be of one mind: that he could prove an inspired choice as Manchester United manager. After last weekend’s defeat by Swansea, people are beginning to doubt him a little bit, not least his decision to switch to a back three, the system he played with Holland in the World Cup. The performance seemed like a re-run of last season. A year ago I did say that I thought United would be struggling to make the top four, because of the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson. But, from what I’ve seen so far, as long as United do make a couple of signings, I think this season will be different. I’ll stick my neck out and say Van Gaal will have them back in the top four again and qualifying for the Champions League; and that will probably be considered job done for the first season. Mr Motivator: Louis van Gaal will work his magic at Manchester United . They do need a midfielder who can orchestrate and change the play and another defender on top of Marcos Rojo, the Argentine they have signed from Sporting Lisbon. But with Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Adnan Januzaj, they look strong going forward. He changed the system at half-time last weekend when it wasn’t working out and went to a back four and ultimately they ended up losing. But though he is sure to be flexible, and switch to a back four at times, my feeling is that the back three is a system that is back in fashion for good reasons. I’ve always been an advocate of its strengths, playing it with Swindon, Chelsea and England and now Harry Redknapp has introduced it at QPR, where I’m coaching. I think the World Cup demonstrated that it is very much a system for the modern game. I don’t think there is any other system that is so flexible in allowing you to get into different shapes and formations so quickly. Costa Rica showed that in Brazil. I think that they won England’s group largely because of the system they played; they had options all over the pitch. Holland played it under Van Gaal and Mexico and Chile also used it well. Remember, Germany found it very difficult against Algeria when the African team used that system. Threat: Manchester United look strong going forward with the likes of Robin van Persie . Talking tactics: Costa Rica used the 3-5-2 system to great effect at the World Cup in Brazil this summer . Best player: Chelsea defender Dan Petrescu was a natural wing back . When I managed England I didn’t want to be outnumbered in midfield, which has traditionally been a problem with the national team. So when we had the ball, we were in the 3-5-2 shape, to give us that extra man in midfield. When we lost the ball, we would slide back into a four and protect ourselves; when in possession you slide into a wide back three. It is a system that can help get you up the ladder, which is how Costa Rica used it. Or, with top-quality players, it can help you create so many problems for the opposition. I think most other formations can struggle against it, especially these days when there is a trend towards trying to get two forwards playing together again. In a 4-4-2 you get outnumbered. A lot of people are playing a diamond formation, but then you can lack width. It allows you to be inventive with player positions, something Van Gaal has done a lot in his career. Don’t be surprised to see Michael Carrick playing in the middle of the centre-halves. When you get the ball there, you need to use it very well. I went back into that position with Swindon and at Chelsea Ruud Gullit played there for me. Steven Gerrard almost played it last year with Liverpool; if the centre halves got into trouble, he would go in behind them. I know some have said that the system can place extraordinary strain on the wing-backs and Gary Neville mentioned earlier in the week that he felt that was the case sometimes when he was asked to play in that position. But I think it’s a fallacy that you need to be an extraordinary runner to play as a wing-back. Dan Petrescu was the best I managed, because he knew which position he should be in when the ball was on the other side of the pitch. Sometimes wing-backs think it is hard work but they get caught out by getting too far forward. You don’t have to be right on the back post attacking and the next minute back on the back post defending. You do it in phases, depending on where the ball is. If you’re using your physical prowess too much and not your mental prowess, then it can be tough. But once you’ve worked with players on the training pitch, you can put that right. And that’s something at which Van Gaal has proved a master over the years. Give him time to work with the squad and both the players and the system might end up surprising people. Rodgers can get the best out of Mario . Liverpool travel to Manchester City on Monday and though he won’t play, it’s likely that Mario Balotelli will be there as a Liverpool player, representing an extraordinary return to the Premier League. Clearly with . Balotelli, it’s not so much what he can do on the pitch — that obviously can be excellent — it’s what happens off it which would worry you. Liverpool bound: Mario Balotelli is ready to make an extraordinary return to the Premier League . A lot of managers and coaches have fallen out with him. But I think Brendan Rodgers will see it as a challenge. He’s a very positive manager and has had experience of dealing with Luis Suarez’s issues. If he can get him firing on all cylinders and if he’s not getting sent off stupidly and rocking the boat, he will make a massive improvement to the team. It puts Liverpool in the frame for the Champions League again, when most people would have said they might struggle to make the top four without Suarez. As such, it’s probably a risk worth taking. Harry's offer was right for me . On Sunday I head back to White Hart Lane with my new club QPR. While Tottenham will always have a special place in my heart, I have been back with other clubs before and you put your professional hat on for the day. I have to make sure I do a good job for QPR. Something special: Glenn Hoddle with Harry Redknapp on the training ground at QPR . With Harry Redknapp returning as well, we will have two former Tottenham managers on the bench. Harry’s call to me came out of the blue. I wasn’t looking to get back on the training ground as I have a number of business and media commitments. I have had other opportunities to come back and even had some preliminary talks with Crystal Palace this week. But this is the role which seemed to fit with what I wanted and my other interests. Hopefully, I’ve got something to offer and Harry has been very positive. It’s great to work with Joe Jordan and Kevin Bond. The season will definitely be challenging but I’m confident we can do something special.","After defeat by Swansea, people are beginning to doubt Louis Van Gaal .

"By . David Kent . A panel of mental health experts has concluded that Oscar Pistorius was not suffering from a mental illness when he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in his home last year. Pistorius' trial resumed after a break of one month during which a psychologist and three psychiatrists also assessed whether the double-amputee runner was capable of understanding the wrongfulness of his act when he shot Steenkamp through a closed toilet door. The panel's reports were submitted to Judge Thokozile Masipa, and prosecutor Gerrie Nel referred to key parts of the conclusions, noting that the experts believed Pistorius was 'capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act' when he killed Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model. Centre of attention: Oscar Pistorius  arrives at court in Pretoria on Monday for the resumption of his murder trial . Scrutiny: The double amputee talks to a member of his defence team as he stands in the dock on Monday . The evaluation came after a psychiatrist, Dr. Merryll Vorster, testified for the defence that Pistorius, who has said he feels vulnerable because of his disability and long-held worry about crime, had an anxiety disorder that could have contributed to the killing in the early hours of February 14. He testified that he opened fire after mistakenly thinking there was a dangerous intruder in the toilet. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has alleged that Pistorius, 27, killed Steenkamp after a Valentine's Day argument, and has portrayed the Olympic athlete as a hothead with a love of guns and an inflated sense of entitlement.

"By . Mike Dawes . Oscar Pistorius sat in the passenger seat of a black sedan speaking on a cellphone as he arrived at a government psychiatric hospital to begin the period of mental evaluation as ordered by the judge at his murder trial. Pistorius' car drove through the security gates of Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital in the South African capital Pretoria behind a police van. Judge Thokozile Masipa last week ordered that Pistorius be observed by a panel of four mental health experts for up to 30 days at Weskoppies after a psychiatrist testified at his trial that he had an anxiety disorder and it could have contributed to his fatal shooting of his girlfriend last year. Arrived: Oscar Pistorius checking in to a government psychiatric hospital on May 26, 2014 . Calling: The South African was spotted on his mobile phone as he was driven through the hospital gates . Waiting game: There was a line of media outlets camped outside for a glimpse of the Paralympian . Charged: Pistorius is on trial for the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . Pistorius will be evaluated as an outpatient and return home each day. He was ordered by Masipa to present himself by 9 am each weekday for tests from Monday for up to a month. His murder trial has been postponed until June 30. He is free on bail. The Paralympian is charged with premeditated murder for shooting to death Reeva Steenkamp at his home on Valentine's Day last year and has been on trial in Pretoria since March 3. Prosecutors say Pistorius, 27, killed Steenkamp, 29, intentionally after a late-night fight but his defense argues he mistook his girlfriend for a dangerous intruder hiding in a toilet cubicle in his bathroom when he shot her multiple times through the stall door. His psychiatric evaluation was prompted by testimony from Dr. Merryll Vorster, a psychiatrist called by his defense, who said she diagnosed the world-famous runner with generalised anxiety disorder after interviewing him on two occasions at the beginning of May. Vorster said Pistorius had a long-held fear of crime and felt vulnerable as an amputee, and his disorder may have been a factor when he fired four times with a 9 mm pistol. The chief prosecutor asked Judge Masipa to order the independent tests because he said Pistorius' defense might argue he wasn't criminally responsible for the killing because of mental illness.

"By . Christopher Torchia, Associated Press . Testimony in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius focused on a pillar of the prosecution's case on Tuesday - the screams that neighbours heard on the night that the athlete killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel questioned an acoustics expert who had been called by the defence team as part of its effort to suggest some neighbours who said they heard the screams of a woman were wrong, and that they actually heard the high-pitched screams of the double-amputee runner. Several neighbours called by the prosecution have testified they heard a woman's terrified screams on the night Pistorius shot Steenkamp, which could bolster the prosecution's claim that the couple were arguing before Pistorius opened fire.

He has testified that he fired in the mistaken belief there was a dangerous intruder in his home. The prosecution has alleged that Pistorius killed Steenkamp after a Valentine's Day argument. The acoustics expert, Ivan Lin, has testified that he conducted tests that showed ambient noise and other factors can make it difficult to hear accurately from a distance.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . New surveillance video showing two officers beating a 37-year-old homeless man was played Monday – the latest evidence presented at a preliminary hearing in the man’s death. The graphic black and white video is from a security camera at the nearby bus depot, and shows Officer Manuel Ramos and Corporal Jay Cincinelli – two men charged in the death of Kelly Thomas. In the footage, which lasts about 25 minutes, Kelly can be heard off-camera, screaming in pain as he is beaten with batons and Tasered by Cicinelli. Scroll down for video: Warning - graphic content . Shocking: Footage from a bus station shows officers beating Kelly Thomas as he begged for his father . Subduing: Thomas screamed out in pain as he was being tasered . Killed: Kelly Thomas, 37, who suffered from schizophrenia, was horrifically beaten to death by police after reports of a homeless man looking into parked cars led to his probe . NBC Los Angeles said that Thomas . ultimately died because of the incredible force of the officers’ weight . on his chest, citing the coroner’s report. He can be heard yelling in the video, ‘I can’t breathe!’ as police continue to taser him. That was not the only shocking moment . shown to the court Monday. The bloody, battered photo of the dead . homeless man drew gasps at the court hearing. Prosecutors revealed that Thomas . begged for his father as a group of police officers hit him with batons . and a Taser at a bus depot in Fullerton, California, last summer. However, . a witness testified that both of the accused officers, Manuel Ramos and . Cpl Jay Cinelli, were in shocked disbelief at the man who refused to . stop fighting them. Ramos was holding his rib cage and out of breath after the incident in July, police forensic specialist Dawn Scruggs said. Ramos told her he had never had anyone fight him like that before, she said. 'He looked like he was in disbelief of what just happened,' Scruggs said during a preliminary hearing being held to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to have the officers stand trial. Ramos and Cicinelli are charged with the death of 37-year old Thomas in the case that spawned a federal civil rights probe and fueled weeks of protests by Fullerton residents. The incident occurred during an investigation of reported car burglaries at a transit hub where numerous buses come and go and commuters park in the Orange County city of Fullerton. Charged: Officer Manuel Ramos (left) is charged with murder for the . fatal beating. Cpl Jay Cicinelli (right) faces lesser charges, but is . still implicated in the death . In court: Fullerton police officers Jay Cicinelli (left) and Manuel Ramos were seen in court at the preliminary hearing Monday . Scruggs said Cicinelli was tired as well when she arrived. 'He was in awe, like oh my God, I can't believe this,' she said. 'This guy just would not stop fighting.' Prosecutors also showed the court a slideshow of officers' cuts and bruises and of Thomas' blood-soaked face and closed purpled eyes after the confrontation. Ramos is accused of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the July 2011 death of Thomas. Cicinelli is charged with involuntary manslaughter and excessive force. Both have pleaded not guilty. A bus surveillance tape previously showed agitated witnesses describing how officers beat Thomas and used a stun gun on him repeatedly as he cried out for his father. Troubled: The officers say Thomas kept fighting them, despite their attempts to subdue him and calm him down . A father's grief: The victim's father, Ron Thomas (right), who was called out for by his son during his beating, spoke to the media after the hearing this week alongside his attorney Garo Mardirossian (left) A message left for Cicinelli's attorney Michael Schwartz was not returned. The FBI launched an investigation shortly after the July 5, 2011, incident to determine if Thomas' civil rights were violated. That probe is ongoing. Prosecutors say the beating began after two officers responded to reports that a homeless person was looking in cars and rattling door handles. The officers stopped Thomas and searched his backpack and asked him to sit on the curb. But the shirtless man, who suffered from schizophrenia, had trouble complying, prosecutors said, at which point Ramos put on a pair of latex gloves, leaned down and threatened him with his fists. At that moment, what began as a fairly routine police investigation turned into a beating, prosecutors said. Game plan: John D. Barnett (left), attorney for Manuel Ramos, confers with Michael Schwartz (right), attorney for Jay Cicinelli, at the preliminary hearing . Prosecutors say Ramos, a 10-year veteran, punched Thomas in the ribs, tackled him and lay on him to pin him down. They say Cicinelli, a 12-year-veteran of the force who arrived on the scene later, used a Taser four times on Thomas as he screamed in pain and also hit him in the face eight times with the Taser. Thomas lost consciousness and was taken to the hospital. He was taken off life support and died five days later. The coroner concluded that Thomas died from mechanical compression of the thorax, which made it impossible for him to breathe normally and deprived his brain of oxygen. Other face and head injuries contributed to his death, prosecutors said. Six Fullerton police officers responded to the incident. All were placed on paid administrative leave and are facing an internal investigation but only Ramos and Cicinelli were criminally charged. The preliminary hearing is expected to last as long as two days, said Susan Kang Schroeder, chief of staff for the Orange County district attorney's office.

"By . Paul Bentley . Tragedy: Gloria Smith died after she drank cleaning fluid which had been left in a water bottle in her hotel room . A mother died on a five-star holiday to Cyprus after she drank from a bottle that a maid had filled with cleaning fluid. Gloria Smith, 60, was on a two-week break with her fiancé when she returned to her £199-a-night room and took a sip from what appeared to be a bottle of  mineral water. Moments later, she collapsed on the bathroom floor, screaming to her partner, Raymond Francis: 'It's poison, help me.' An inquest yesterday heard that the maid at the Salamis Bay Conti Resort Hotel in Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, had filled the bottle with a stain remover and left it behind when she had finished cleaning their room. She was arrested following Mrs Smith's death but released without charge when it became clear that she had made what Mr Francis describes as a 'stupid' and 'negligent' mistake. The couple were on the fourth day of their holiday in September 2010 when they returned to their hotel room to shower after a morning on the beach. After declaring she was thirsty, Mrs Smith took the water bottle from a table of drinks in their room and walked to the en suite bathroom, where she suddenly fell to the floor, screaming for help. Mr Francis, 62, came after her and tasted the discarded bottle, which burned his lips, before calling the hotel reception to demand  an ambulance. The hotel's doctor had finished work for the day. Mr Francis's fiancée, who was a retired hairdresser, was rushed to hospital but died of a heart attack in an ambulance while being transferred to a specialist unit on the holiday island. The toxic cleaning fluid was said to have caused a build-up of fluid in her lungs and brain. Speaking from the home he had shared with Mrs Smith in Walsall, Mr Francis said she had had so much to live for. 'She was an emotional lady but very loving, we had spoken about getting married,' he said. 'She had so much to live for, she was very happy. She said: “I have a future to look forward to.”' The retired antiques dealer added: 'Gloria should not have died. It was negligence. It was a stupid, careless mistake. 'We'd come back from a morning on the beach and I suggested we go to the Turkish baths for a sauna. 'Negligent': The retired hairdresser was on the fourth day of her holiday when she drank the poisonous liquid, which had been siphoned into a water bottle by a cleaner . 'She had so much to live for': Mrs Smith with her partner Raymond Francis on a previous holiday in Goa . 'When we came back to the room Gloria . said she was going to have a shower and she said she was thirsty.

'Gloria went into the bathroom and a . few seconds later I heard her screaming, shouting: “It's poison', help . me”. She'd dropped the bottle into the sink and was on all fours. 'I picked up the bottle and tasted it . and it burned. I tried to help her straight away.' Mr Francis said the . bottle looked exactly like a regular small water container.

"By . Karolos Grohmann, Reuters . Opponents of FIFA President Sepp Blatter should run against him instead of merely criticising his decision to go for another term at the helm of world soccer's governing body, Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said on Friday. Watzke also told Reuters in an interview it would be best not to hold the 2022 World Cup in the desert state of Qatar. The 78-year-old Blatter, who has been in charge of FIFA since 1998, announced this week he would run for a fifth term despite mounting criticism over alleged corruption and FIFA's decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. Hans-Joachim Watzke says that Sepp Blatter's critics should stand against him or keep quiet . UEFA president Michel Platini has decided not to run against Blatter who is standing for a fifth term . Blatter, who will be 79 when the votes are cast next June, confirmed his candidature for another term as president in a recorded interview at the Soccerex Global Convention in Manchester this week. 'We have to be a bit careful with criticism here,' said Dortmund's Watzke. 'If there are people out there who consider a fifth term as too long or that he is too old for this position then they should run against Blatter.' European soccer boss Michel Platini was seen as a potential rival to Blatter but he opted not to run against him next year. The only other declared candidate is the former FIFA deputy secretary general Jerome Champagne but he may withdraw now that Blatter has declared his interest. Sepp Blatter has come under fire for FIFA's decision to play the 2022 World Cup in Qatar . 'Otherwise I would be a bit more reserved with criticism,' said Watzke, who has not hidden his opposition to FIFA's decision to award the World Cup to Qatar. FIFA is now considering staging the tournament in the winter due to the soaring summer temperatures in the Middle East with European clubs not relishing the prospect of a disrupted league competition that year. 'That (date) needs to be discussed internally but it is a problem,' said the 55-year-old Watzke. 'My opinion is that it would be best for all if the World Cup would not take place in Qatar.' Sepp Blatter had promised that his current term would be his last but will stand again in June, aged 79 .","Borussia Dortmund CEO says there is too much criticism without action .

Werder Bremen defender Sebastian Proedl scored late to earn a 3-3 draw at Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga on Friday, ending the home side's perfect start to the season. Leverkusen, which had won all five competitive games under new coach Roger Schmidt, opened the scoring in the 17th minute through Tin Jedvaj's powerful shot in off the crossbar but was left to rue missed chances when Fin Bartels equalized with Bremen's first real attack just before the break.

"By . Phil Medlicott, Press Association Sport . Stoke boss Mark Hughes hopes Mame Biram Diouf has returned from his Senegal commitments in decent condition to face Leicester on Saturday. Diouf scored an eye-catching solo effort to steer the Potters to a shock 1-0 Barclays Premier League victory at reigning champions Manchester City on August 30. Since then the forward has been on Senegal duty for African Nations Cup qualifiers at home against Egypt last Friday and then in Botswana on Wednesday. Mark Hughes hopes Mame Biram Diouf has returned from his Senegal commitments in a decent condition . Mame Biram Diouf scored an eye-catching solo effort to steer Stoke to a shock 1-0 win over Manchester City . Having only returned from his considerable travels to Stoke's training ground on Friday, Diouf will not have had a chance to do a session with his team-mates ahead of Saturday's league game. And Hughes said at his pre-match press conference at the Britannia Stadium on Friday afternoon: 'Mame Diouf was walking into the training ground as I left, funnily enough, so I had a chance to speak to him. 'By all accounts he is okay, but we have to make a judgement on him just to see how he is physically, and mentally, in terms of the amount of travelling he has done and how that will affect his approach to the game. 'We will get a feeling for that before the game and then I'll make a decision as to whether he plays or not.' The win against City was Stoke's first in the league of the season following a 1-0 home defeat to Aston Villa and then a 1-1 draw at Hull. Hughes has no doubt it is best to head into an international break off the back of a victory, but is frustrated that the domestic hiatus came along when his side were gathering some momentum. 'Obviously the breaks are in the season, you know they are coming and you have to make the best of it,' Hughes said. 'The best way to go into an international break is with a positive result. It is a lot easier to take when you have played well and got maximum points - then everyone goes away in good heart. Mame Biram Diouf scored the only goal as Stoke beat Manchester City 1-0 and they have Leicester next . 'It is slightly different if you have a poor performance, you have been beaten and then all of a sudden people are flying all over the world and you have no time to review what went on or address some of the issues the game brought up. 'So we had the better of that this time having won at Man City, but it is a little bit frustrating for everybody because it is a little bit fragmented at the moment. 'The season needs to get up and running, but after only three games, we are having international breaks.' Hughes nonetheless believes the City victory will have set his players in good stead for the Leicester contest, although he sees the desire to make up for a poor home performance in the Villa match as a greater motivator ahead of Saturday's fixture. Stoke City manager Mark Hughes hopes Mame Biram Diouf will be ready for their Leicester City match . The Welshman said: 'I think we can use (the City game) by saying that is the standard in terms of committing to what we are trying to do. We have set the bar. 'But I think the fact that our last home league game was a little bit flat from our point of view, when there had been a lot of expectation on us before it and on the day Villa were the better team - I think we will use that as more of a motivation than possibly the Man City game for this one.' Winger Oussama Assaidi is in contention to make his 'second debut' for Stoke on Saturday after rejoining on another season-long loan deal from Liverpool on transfer deadline day.

"By . Sophie Borland for the Daily Mail . Hundreds of thousands of elderly people are struggling to get out of bed in the morning, wash themselves and prepare meals because they are not getting enough support at home, research reveals. Nearly 900,000 over-65s are being denied help with essential everyday tasks by either carers or family and friends, according to Age UK. This includes 500,000 who have difficulty having a bath, 190,000 who need help getting up, and 160,000 who are struggling to cook for themselves. New research has revealed that 900,000 OAPs are being denied help at home with basic tasks such as cooking dinner or having a bath by either carers or relatives . The charity blames cuts to council budgets which has resulted in local authorities imposing much stricter criteria to decide who is eligible for state-funded help at home. In some cases carers call for just 15 minutes a day meaning tasks are rushed or left undone. The Daily Mail has long campaigned for improved care for older people at home and in hospital as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Age UK analysed the results of a national survey of 10,600 over-65s which assessed whether they were being given help with everyday tasks. Nearly a third – 31 per cent – of those who struggle to carry out some daily activities said they did not get enough help from either carers or family. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘It beggars belief that one in three older people who need some basic help with daily living are now having to do without it. ‘When older people begin to need some help with essential daily tasks like eating and washing they should expect that it will be there for them, yet it is increasingly beyond their reach. ‘This is profoundly shocking, and it’s a direct result of our care system being scaled back at the same time as the population of older people is growing. 'Our national failure to invest properly in social care not only deprives older people of vital support, it also makes no economic sense. Charity blames council funding cuts meaning stricter criteria is used to decide who is eligible for home care . ‘For example, an older person who struggles to eat is more likely to become ill and need expensive hospital treatment than if they receive some regular help with their meals: social care helps older people to stay well and keep their independence for longer. Older people deserve so much better.’ Based on its findings from the survey, the charity estimated that 870,000 people aged 65 to 89 are not being given enough support with basic everyday tasks. This figure also includes 200,000 who need help taking medication, 590,000 who dress themselves with difficulty, and 120,000 who need assistance with going to the toilet. According to Age UK, the amount spent on social care has been cut by £1.2billion since 2010, over which time the elderly population has increased. Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘This research paints a depressing picture of a generation of older people facing loneliness, neglect and struggling to cope at home. ‘David Cameron has allowed home care support to be withdrawn from thousands of people. This is a false economy and one of the main causes of the intense pressure on A&E.’ Last year research by charity Leonard Cheshire Disability found that half of councils are granting elderly and disabled only 15-minute carer visits. It said the slots were so short that vulnerable residents were forced to choose between having a cup of tea or going to the toilet.","Research finds OAPs are being denied help by carers or family and friends .

"By . John Stevens for the Daily Mail . Ed Miliband will today tell Scottish voters not to use their referendum to rid themselves of the Tory-led government... because he says he’ll win the general election. The Labour leader will claim the Conservatives are ‘on their way out’ in an attempt to persuade his party’s traditional voters to reject independence. The latest opinion polls show up to 30 per cent of Labour’s natural supporters may be ready to switch allegiance and back Alex Salmond’s plan to break up Britain. Pledge: Pro-union campaigners Ed Miliband and wife Justine. The Labour leader will today make a series of pledges to shore up support for the Scottish No vote . Many are thought to have been wooed by the SNP’s message that a vote for independence would mean Scotland would no longer be ruled by English Tory ministers sitting in Westminster. Now, in a speech at Blantyre in South Lanarkshire, Mr Miliband will make a series of pledges in a bid to shore up the No vote. The tone of the speech is in marked contrast to the pro-union campaign so far, which has seen the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats working closely together. It is understood the new tactic was signed off by Tory strategists within the Better Together campaign. Winning over undecided Scots in Labour heartlands such as Glasgow is seen as crucial to reviving the No campaign, which has seen its lead slip from 22 percentage points to just six in one month. Mr Miliband will say that ‘as Prime Minister’ in eight months’ time he will tax bankers’ bonuses, raise the minimum wage, introduce a new higher rate of tax and abolish the so-called bedroom tax. ‘The SNP want to tell you we can’t defeat the Tories. They are wrong,’ he will say. ‘Change is coming in the UK – the Tories are on their way out. They are losing their MPs, they are defecting, divided and downhearted. A Labour government is within our grasp. With that election in just eight months’ time the change Scotland needs is on its way. Electing a Labour government is the way to change Scotland.’ Poll shock: Alex Salmond, pictured with Yes-branded cakes, has seen his side rocket to 47 per cent of the vote . He will claim: ‘We will abolish the bedroom tax. Abolish it in Dundee, in Glasgow, but also in Carlisle, Newcastle and Nottingham.’ The attack on the Tories comes after the leader of the Scottish Conservatives played down her party’s chances at the next election. During a TV debate on Tuesday, Ruth Davidson said: ‘Frankly [a Conservative victory in May] isn’t looking likely by the polls, but we are trying our best.’ The comments were read as an attempt to persuade Scots to stay in the UK. Mr Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg were accused of complacency at Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday, as the main parties were urged to ‘drop everything’ and fight for a No vote. Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh said: ‘If we were to lose the Union, it would be not only a disaster for Scotland, but a national humiliation of catastrophic proportions. ‘I say gently to the three party leaders that perhaps we have been a bit complacent up to now. I urge them, over the next two weeks, to drop everything else and stand shoulder to shoulder to fight for the Union that we love and believe in.’ Mr Cameron replied: ‘The leaders of the parties in this House have all put aside their differences and said that, in spite of the political differences we have, we all agree about one thing: not only is Scotland better off inside the United Kingdom, but the United Kingdom is better off with Scotland inside it.’ Of the 650 MPs in Westminster, 59 represent Scottish seats; Labour, which accounts for 41 of these, would be the hardest-hit by a Yes vote. Without Scotland, the Tories would have had a 21-seat majority at the 2010 election. Labour still would have won majorities in 1997, 2001 and 2005. The Scottish Nationalists’ campaign has been boosted by two polls in the last week, which both suggested 47 per cent of decided voters will back independence, compared with 53 per cent who will vote No. Mr Salmond’s former policy chief yesterday claimed that SNP insiders now believe they can win the referendum by snaring 55 per cent of the voters. Both sides in the independence battle are stepping up pressure in the central belt, dominated by Labour MPs, as shown in this map of the 2010 general election result . This could lead the UK into a eurozone-style crisis, Goldman Sachs has warned. Its analysts said Scottish independence was still unlikely, but ‘could have severe consequences’ for the UK and Scottish economies. ‘The most important specific risk, in our view, is that the uncertainty over whether an independent Scotland would be able to retain sterling as its currency could result in a [Europe-style] currency crisis occurring within the UK,’ wrote Kevin Daly, a senior economist at the bank. He also warned that an independent Scotland would face much higher borrowing costs, and be forced to cut public services. Separating Scotland from the rest of the UK after a Yes vote could take years, a former Cabinet Secretary has warned. Lord Turnbull told BBC Newsnight it would be ‘a bigger task than I ever had to face’, adding: ‘It is a major exercise trying to unpick a constitutional settlement built up over 300 years.’ Lord Turnbull, who was the top civil servant from 2002 to 2005, cast doubt on SNP leader . Alex Salmond’s claim that it would only take 18 months for Scotland to become fully independent. ‘I very much doubt it,’ Lord Turnbull said. ‘He wants it done in a year and a half. The rest of the UK Government... why should they dance to that deadline?’","Labour leader will say Conservatives are 'on their way out'

"By . Tony Jimenez, Reuters . A hole-in-one helped lift European Tour journeyman Graeme Storm to the top of the leaderboard after the third round of the European Masters in Switzerland on Saturday. The 36-year-old Briton's tee shot at the 217-yard, par-three 11th bounced off a bank at the side of the green before taking three hops and diving into the middle of the cup. The ace won Storm a BMW sportscar worth around 144,000 euros(£114,227) and he eventually finished with a one-stroke lead after posting a six-under-par 64 for a 16-under tally of 194. Ace: Storm celebrates the hole-in-one that puts him top of the leaderboard at Crans-sur-Sierre . 'It was an incredible feeling,' the Englishman told reporters at Crans-sur-Sierre. 'I had a hole-in-one earlier in the season in Morocco and won a lamp so I think this prize just about tops that one.

"By . Marcus Townend For Mail Online . Irish trainer Eddie Lynam goes in search of history with one of his all-conquering Power rangers in the £273,000 Group One Betfred Sprint Cup but this time his speedster might struggle to call the tune with Music Master in the field. In a memorable summer, Lynam has won all four Group One sprints run this season with Slade Power (Diamond Jubilee Stakes and July Cup) and Sole Power (King’s Stand and Nunthorpe Stakes). Another victory for Sole Power would give Lynam a unique clean sweep in Britain’s five Group One sprints but to achieve the feat Sole Power must do what he has never done – win over six furlongs. Clean sweep: Eddie Lynam is looking for his fifth Group one sprint victory of the season . Sole Power, the 7-2 favourite, is arguably in the form of his life and drying conditions play to his strengths but it cannot be ignored that all 10 of the seven-year-old gelding’s wins have come over five furlongs, . All seven runs at six have ended in defeat and he finished 11th of 12 to Dream Ahead when running in this race in 2011. His jockey Richard Hughes, architect of a daring hold-up effort in the Nunthorpe, may be expressing confidence about the trip but, with that stark statistic hanging over him, Sole Power has to be opposed. The one to drain the Sole’s power could be Music Master (Haydock, 3.50), who was forced to miss the Nunthorpe when off-colour. Most of this colt’s early races were over seven furlongs, including fifth in the Royal Ascot’s Jersey Stakes last year, but he has found his niche sprinting. Win: Sole Power won at King's Stand and Nunthorpe Stakes, and could add a third at the Betfred Sprint Cup . His fourth to Slade Power in the Diamond Jubilee was all the more meritorious as he raced in a disadvantaged breakaway group and jockey Fergus Sweeney had to make a move sooner than he probably wanted. In contrast, his latest win in Newbury’s Group Three Hackwood Stakes saw Music Master eat up the ground in the final furlong after being asked a big hold-up question. His trainer Henry Candy may have made his name with middle distance stars like Master Willie and Time Charter but, in more recent times, sprinters like Kyllachy and Markab, winner of this race in 2010, have defined his career. Candy said: ‘It’s maturity, a change of tactics and the trainer finally getting the right trip with Music Master. ‘He has been an absolute revelation this year. He looks nothing like a sprinter but it is amazing how he covers the ground. Double: Slade Power, also trained by lynam,  won the Diamond Jubilee Stakes and July Cup . ‘He didn’t give me any reason to think seven furlongs wasn’t right and then went to (Glorious) Goodwood last year and was drawn on the outside in a huge handicap. ‘Fergus had to use up a lot of horse to get into the right position. Two furlongs out, he looked like winning 10 lengths and then fell in a heap. ‘We messed about with cross nosebands and tongue ties but the answer was he was just getting faster as he was getting older. ‘If there similarities between this horse and Markab it is that they are both big horses and, therefore, rather by definition, likely to improve with time.’ Other potential improvers in the line-up are Cougar Mountain, Extortionist and G Force, all strong finishers in the Nunthorpe, the latter being particularly unlucky. While the standard is set by last year’s winner, and 2012 runner-up, Gordon Lord Byron.","Irish trainer Eddie Lynam targeting clean sweep in Group One sprints .

The Magpies have only kept one clean sheet in their last 14  Premier League games against Southampton and have never managed a shutout against them on the south coast in 14 PL trips there. Indeed, Saints have scored in each of their last 24 home league games against Newcastle, last drawing a blank in February 1969. The Magpies have failed to score in seven of their last nine away league games (W1 D2 L6). Overall, Alan Pardew’s side have taken just five points from the last 33 on offer (W1 D2 L8). Stephen Carr celebrates with Jermaine Jenas and Andy O'Brein during a rare Newcastle win at Southampton in September 2004, with the full-back scoring the winning goal in a 2-1 victory . Saints have only lost one of their last seven league games (W3 D3). Only at Liverpool (0.30) do Newcastle average fewer points per game than they do at Southampton (0.43) in the Premier League era (minimum four games). Sadio Mane scored two and assisted four in just four Austrian Bundesliga appearances this season. Last term, he scored 13 and assisted 12 in 33 games. Two of Newcastle’s goals in their last Premier League match were scored by Englishmen (Aarons and Williamson); more than in the whole of 2013-14 (1).

"By . Jason Mellor . Gus Poyet insists he is satisfied Sunderland did everything they could during the transfer window to try to build a squad capable of becoming a force in the Premier League. Poyet failed to land top target Fabio Borini during the summer after a long running saga, but did manage to add defender Sebastian Coates and winger Ricky Alvarez to his squad before the September 1 deadline. The arrival of Liverpool’s Coates and Inter Milan’s Alvarez meant that Sunderland ended the window with eight new players and both could be involved against Tottenham on Saturday at the Stadium of Light. Sunderland players hold a rainbow flag in support of Stonewall's Rainbow Laces campaign . Gus Poyet insists he is satisfied with Sunderland's transfer activity during the transfer window .

And the Sunderland head coach, who took part in some football tennis with his squad during training, said: 'It is very easy to say that I am happy because then everyone would be delighted. I’m alright, but I wouldn't say I am happy. 'We expected to have a certain number of players, we were close to doing a couple of important things, but we tried. We tried our best. What we got was the best we could do. I don’t want to reflect on how it went because it is not fair.' Jozy Altidore slides in as the Sunderland squad prepare for Saturday's match against Tottenham . Sunderland boss Gus Poyet enjoys a game of football tennis during Sunderland's training session . Gus Poyet shares a joke with his Sunderland players on Thursday . Alvarez has arrived on a season-long loan and should provide an exciting option down the left hand side, although he can play on both flanks. The Argentine should provide a different threat, although he is not a renowned goalscorer. Poyet said: 'People will think that Ricky is the substitute for Borini, but he is not. It’s different opinions. Ricky is a player who is exciting on the ball, he will create things on his own but he is not a proper scorer. 'We can’t say he is a replacement for the other one. He is going to play in a position where Fabio played last year, but I don’t know if he will play on the left all of the time.'

"By . Marcus Townend for MailOnline . The name of the five-year-old gelding peering from the box in what was once known as Millionaire’s Row is highly appropriate — Emerging Talent. The winner of a National Hunt Flat race at Naas is a symbol of change at the Somerset stable of champion Jumps trainer Paul Nicholls. Where once stood 2008 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Denman, 2012 Grand National winner Neptune Collonges, dual champion chaser Master Minded and the daddy of them all, dual Gold Cup hero and five-time King George VI Chase winner Kauto Star, there are now only plaques listing their achievements. Optimistic: Trainer Paul Nicholls at his Somerset stables . Last to retirement last season was four-time World Hurdle winner Big Buck’s and Tidal Bay, a relative newcomer to the Ditcheat operation, but one who quickly became part of the furniture. Their departures finally bolted the door on a golden era. Where once stood achievement, there is now aspiration, hope and promise. When Nicholls welcomes 350 guests to his private owners’ day this morning, there will see around 50 new horses – close to a third of the stable for the forthcoming new season. Leading the team may be 2013 King George winner Silviniaco Conti, who could make an earlier than expected return to action in the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby on November 1. But the focus will be on fresh stock like French imports Le Mercurey and three-year-old Ibis Du Rheu, half-brother to stablemate Saphir Du Rheu who will go novice chasing after winning four hurdle race last year culminating in the Welsh Champion Hurdle. It will not only be fresh equine talent on show. After Daryl Jacob’s brief tenure as main rider to the stable, new stable jockey for the 2014-15 season is Sam Twiston-Davies with Nick Scholfield as his understudy. Number one: Jockey Sam Twiston-Davies will be Nicholls' main rider in the 2014-15 season . With the surprise announcement that Nicholls’ nephew and conditional jockey Harry Derham is quitting riding, there will be also be more chances for fellow conditional Jack Sherwood, son former jockey and trainer Simon Sherwood, plus Sean Bowen, son of welsh trainer Peter Bowen, who is about to join stable. A new set of priorities are driving Nicholls, who unexpectedly wrestled back his champion trainer’s title from great rival Nicky Henderson last season to become champion jumps trainer for an eighth time. Nicholls said: ‘It is now all about the future. I am not starting this season trying to win the champion. ‘I have been lucky and won it eight times but that means it is almost like numbers now. I don’t have to be champion to be where I want to be. ‘I enjoy bringing the young horses so much – I am not going to lose sleep if I don’t win the title. ‘We have had the biggest clear-out as we have ever had. Over 50 horses have been sold or moved on. ‘Neptune Collonges, Denman, Big Buck’s, Master Minded, Kauto Star- you can go on and on. It was a golden era - amazing. Back-up: Nick Scholfield will provide support for Twiston-Davies . ‘We will probably never replace them. In fact, I don’t think we’ll ever see so many good horses in one yard at one time again. It is like starting again and it is exciting.’ Nicholls uses the same words when talking about 21-year-old Twiston-Davies. Jacob never seemed at ease last year as the stable’s top jockey as he tried to replace long-time Nicholls ally Ruby Walsh. Nicholls was forced to move when it seemed Twiston-Davies, who will still ride father Nigel’s Champion Hurdle hope The New One, was about to be lured out of his reach by a rival job offer. Nicholls, who often uses his owner and ex-Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson as a sounding board, added: ‘It was all forced on us probably a year before we thought it might happen but Fergie always says you wouldn’t want to let a top striker sign up for an opposing team and regret it for the rest of your life. ‘I like Sam a lot. He is positive. He is nowhere near the finished article. You should remember what Ruby was like at the same age and how must better he got – the same with McCoy. ‘Sam will be under a bit of pressure and need time to bed in but I am not worried about that – we will deal with it.’ Buy the Paul Nicholls Owners Day brochure (£15 inc p&p) at paulnichollsracing.com (all proceeds to charity)","Sam Twiston-Davies will be Nicholls' main rider for 2014-15 with Nick Scholfield as his understudy .

Criminal: Brownson stole from Mrs Darling four times, shown here again stealing from her purse while she showered . Immoral: The woman, brazenly wearing her nurse's uniform, rifles through the pensioner's belongings in search of cash, left, before pulling out the cash and pocketing it . Brownson has been jailed for 48 weeks . by magistrates in Peterlee, County Durham, for four thefts totalling . £530. However large sums of Mrs Darling’s money are still unaccounted . for. The deception left the widow suicidal and afraid to live in her own home. She has since moved to a care home. Mrs . Darling’s family were tipped off to Brownson’s stealing after cleaner .

A . surveillance device disguised as a pen was then set up in Mrs Darling’s . bedroom. Brownson was caught rifling through the pensioner’s handbag . and taking money from her purse in July when her client was in the . shower. Brownson had been . brought in because Mrs Darling needed help in the shower, but that was . the moment the carer seized the opportunity to steal from her. Mrs . Williams told the Daily Mirror: ‘In December Mrs Darling became so . frail that the only option left was for her to go into a care home, . which is something she was determined she wouldn’t do. ‘Her only wish was to see out her days in her own home and Angela Brownson robbed her of that. The . stress and anxiety caused her to stop eating and she lost four stone in . weight, she stopped sleeping because she was worried Brownson was going . to come back and break into her home. ‘[Brownson] . will serve her time in prison but what she suffers in jail will be . nothing in comparison to the effect she’s had on poor Mrs Darling’s . life.’ Brownson, of Ferryhill, County Durham, denied all the charges against her but was convicted following the trial. Mike . Clarke, defending, said that Brownson still refused to accept her . guilt, but had been affected by the revelation at the hearing last . Friday that Mrs Darling had been forced into care. Alarm bells: A cleaner had seen Brownson buying Prosecco at the supermarket and the family agreed to set up a secret camera which showed her rummaging through her bag while she showered .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for the Daily Mail . Celtic have landed a £212,000 Champions League bonus — after UEFA hammered Manchester City for breaching financial fair play rules. England’s champions were fined £50million for the FFP breaches but will only pay £20million provided they comply with break-even rules in future. Paris St Germain and Zenit St Petersburg were amongst nine clubs fined and the 70 clubs who reached the Champions League and Europa League group stages will each receive Euros 265,000 (£212,000) from the penalties. Beneficiaries: Celtic are among the clubs who will receive the funds from the FFP fines . Buying: Manchester City owner Sheikh mansour shows no sign of stopping his spending spree . Similar sums will be distributed to clubs who comply with the FFP rules in this season’s European competitions – meaning Celtic will double their money next season after reaching the Europa League group stage. The deal was hammered out in talks between the European Clubs’ Association and UEFA with ECA chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge saying: ‘It was an agreement between UEFA and the clubs that it was money belonging to the clubs.’ UEFA president Michel Platini addressed the ECA conference in Geneva attended by Celtic, Rangers and Motherwell and reiterated his commitment to FFP saying: ‘We will see whether any imperfections can be ironed out and whether there is room to further improve the system.’ Parkhead chief executive Peter Lawwell also lifted an ECA best achievement in marketing award after Celtic installed state of the art wifi last season. Advantage: The money City have been fined will be redistributed to other Champions League clubs . Selling: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho insists his side have had to become a selling club due to the rules .","Manchester City fined £50million for breaking financial fair play regulations .

He confirmed it in his first training session.' Manchester United's press conference told us a lot, but what exactly?

A Queens Park Rangers debut beckons. Robin van Persie is also 'fitter than ever'. 2) BLIND IS HAPPY AS A DEFENDER OR MIDFIELDER: Daley Blind is happy to be a defender or midfielder, and the versatile player will do whatever's he's told by Louis van Gaal. 3) VAN GAAL WON'T LOSE SLEEP OVER PICKING HIS XI: Van Gaal says he won't have a problem picking a starting XIbecause Manchester United let a sufficient number of squad members leave during the summer, too. 4) VAN GAAL IS PREPARED TO GIVE YOUTH PLAYERS A CHANCE: Van Gaal is prepared to give youth players a chance and says it is a proud legacy of Manchester United which he feels he must protect. 5) FALCAO SAYS CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUALIFICATION IS HIS MAIN AIM: Falcao is not fretting about missing out on the Champions League. The striker's key aim this season is Champions League qualification and he insists it's well within reach. 'I hope so because they have to perform our philosophy. That philosophy is not so easy to perform. 'We've seen it already, but I think the players we have selected take that on better. Otherwise, we don't have to buy these players, I don't think.' 'I feel very, very good in myself. I'm very happy to be here. I've had a great welcome. When you're talking of a settling in period, real quality and real top footballers makes it easier. It's something I'm looking forward to getting started. 'I think I will not need too much time because Manchester United has very good players and that reason makes it easier to play football. I'm used to life in cities like this. I think I don't have a problem for adaptation. 'Every player wants to play Champions League. This year is not possible in Manchester, but we are confident to achieve the qualify for next season for next Champions League.' 'How to fit in these players is not so difficult, I think, when you let go 14 players. Six players coming in. We need also the youth education. That's the policy of Manchester United also, and when you don't let go of players to another club, then you are never allowed to give a youth player a chance. Because of this policy, we give youth players a chance. 'But the question is, if they take the chance, it's of course more risky but I think it's the only way to do it in Man United. Man United has always grown up players in the squad. That's the only way to do it.' 'For me it's important I can in both positions - defence and midfield. 'I want to play and if it's on the left or in defence or in midfield, it's up to the coach. 'I try to do my best wherever I play.' 'Good afternoon. I'm very happy to be here, it's a big challenge for me, for my career. I always dreamed to be in a club like Manchester United. 'I feel well. I started to play two months ago with Monaco and I've improved in the last month a lot. I scored goals, that's important to strikers. And I'm confident with my physical form. I'm comfortable with my knee. 'It's a new process, new team. This year come some players, and I think Manchester United build a big team this season, and then future seasons.

"By . Nick Purewal, Press Association Sport . Harry Redknapp has branded threats QPR could be thrown out of the Championship if relegated from the Premier League this season as 'unrealistic'. The Rangers boss criticised the financial fair play rules that could land the Loftus Road club with a £40million fine. Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey has warned QPR must pay their impending fine for expected losses of £60million from last term, when they won promotion from the Championship, or be punished in another way, which could include being refused entry to the League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Harry Redknapp: What actually is Financial Fair Play? Harry Redknapp believes it is 'unrealistic' that QPR could be expelled from the Championship . Charlie Austin celebrates with Rio Ferdinand after scoring in their 1-0 win over Sunderland . Rangers have vowed to fight any sanctions, but must submit last year's accounts or pay their fine by December 1. 'There would have to be quite a few kicked out if that were to happen, wouldn't there?' said Redknapp, ahead of QPR's league trip to Old Trafford on Sunday. 'I think it's unrealistic, and I don't see it happening. 'To make it fair play we should be able to spend as much as Man United before we play them on Sunday shouldn't we? 'What is fair play? I don't know. 'One team can spend £200million on a team, another team might spend £8million on a team, and that's not fair play is it. 'Fair play would be everybody having a maximum of £30million a year to spend on their team, produce some kids out of the youth team and work harder with the players they've got. 'To call it fair play, the whole league isn't fair play: you've got seven teams at the top on another planet. 'I don't know what the rules are to be honest, but the owners have brought a few players in. 'We've lost (Loic) Remy but we've spent maybe £20million above the Remy money, so the owners have been fantastic, the effort to help us compete. 'But it's never going to be a fair playing field, you haven't got to be a genius to know the top seven will almost certainly be the same as last year. 'It can get a bit boring, but it will be the same, I'm pretty sure of that.' Loic Remy moved to Chelsea from rivals QPR in a deal on the day before the transfer deadline . Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey has warned QPR that they will have to pay the fine . Boss Harvey is adamant the Football League has the power to impose sanctions on QPR, despite their summer promotion. 'Theoretically that is the position, but I would hope there would be resolution long before that option even had to be considered,"" Harvey said at Manchester's Soccerex conference on Tuesday. 'We are satisfied we still have the ability under our regulations to charge them for a breach of our rules whilst they were in membership. 'The one thing for certain is that most clubs [in the Premier League] will become a Football League club again."" Redknapp believes QPR can avoid the situation entirely if they secure their Premier League status this term. 'I've blocked it out of my own mind,' he said. 'That's up to the owners, I'm sure they know what they're doing and I'll leave it to them. 'If we can (avoid relegation) yes, but it's a difficult one: if teams invest then get relegated, what do you do? 'You lose all your players. 'If you buy a few players to try to stay up then go down, you can't suddenly have a fire sale, it's tough to unload players on Premier League wages into the Championship. 'It's a chicken and egg situation: do you just come up and go down again, and not spend any money? 'Or do you spend the money, go down again and struggle to release the players, and get punished by the Fair Play rule? 'I don't know, it's a strange one.'","Redknapp brands threats QPR could be thrown out of the Championship if they are relegated this season as 'unrealistic'

UEFA announced that its disciplinary panel imposed sanctions after incidents that occurred during Ludogorets elimination of Steaua Bucharest in a play-off last week. Steaua was also punished for fans' racist behavior, for the second time this season, and must play a Europa League match in an empty stadium. Shameful: Steaua Bucharest (above) and Ludogorets have been punished for fans' racist behaviour . Safe hands: Ludogorets defeated Steaua in a play-off after penalty heroics from stand-in keeper Cosmin Moti . UEFA did not specify details of the racist incidents. Ludogorets are making their first appearance in the competition in a group that also features Liverpool and Basel. The Bulgarian champions host Real Madrid on October 1 in the National Stadium, Sofia, because their own ground does not meet UEFA standards. UEFA fined Ludogorets 16,000 euros (£12,709) for offences including fans invading the field and the team receiving at least five yellow cards. Pretty in pink! Ludogorets will have to play their Champions League debut against Real Madrid, featuring Gareth Bale (L), with sections of their stadium closed . Meanwhile, Steaua were fined 64,500 euros (£51,235) for the racism and other offenses. Last month, the 1986 European Cup winners were forced to close two stadium sections in a third qualifying round, second-leg match. It followed racist incidents in the previous round against Stromsgodset of Norway. UEFA operates an escalating scale of sanctions with further racism incidents provoking full stadium closures, leading to possible disqualification from competitions. 'All forms of racist behavior are considered serious offences against the disciplinary regulations and are punished with the most severe sanctions,' UEFA said.","Ludogorets and Steaua Bucharet have been punished for fans' racist behaviour during Champions League play-off .

England captain Wayne Rooney should be moved back into a midfield role for Monday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland, according to Paul Scholes. The Three Lions struggled to a 1-0 friendly win over Norway on Wednesday, with Rooney scoring the only goal of the game from the penalty spot. But Scholes, who won 66 caps for his country, believes Roy Hodgson should play his captain in a more withdrawn role when they visit St Jakob Park in Basle.

Rooney celebrates after scoring a penalty to seal a 1-0 friendly win against Norway at Wembley . The former Manchester United star is concerned that England lack a midfield player capable of passing the ball with flair after the retirement of Steven Gerrard, but he sees Rooney as the ideal man to fill that void against the Swiss. In his column for The Independent, Scholes wrote: 'It is a radical solution, and one I would propose just for the Switzerland qualifier on Monday, but I would play Wayne Rooney in midfield. 'This is not an argument to say Wayne is not a top striker. His record says that he is and, in an ideal world, I would have two Waynes: one to hit those passes from deep and another to get on the end of them. He is the best passer in the team and he can play that midfield role better than anyone. 'One thing you can be sure about Wayne is that he is not bothered about taking risks. If he saw the pass was on, he would hit it. If it did not work out, that would not deter him from trying it again and again. He would make that pass more often than not.'

He added: 'Moving Wayne would be a compromise for Roy Hodgson because this England team is not so blessed with goals that it can afford to lose its top goalscorer from the front line. 'During and after the World Cup I argued for Wayne to be played as a centre-forward but, with these three ahead of him, he could be a huge influence. And he could still make runs into the box.'

"By . Leon Watson . Researchers in the U.S. have found a gene that boosts intelligence could offer new hope to sufferers of dementia . Scroll down for video . A gene that boosts intelligence could offer new hope to sufferers of dementia, it was revealed today. Researchers in the U.S. found a . protein produced by the gene could be synthesised and used to fight the condition. The study, funded by the U.S.-based National Institutes of Health, . found the protein called klotho boosts brain skills such as thinking, . learning and memory. It is believed it could increase the strength of connections between nerve cells in the brain. Dena Dubal, professor of neurodegeneration at UCSF, the lead author, said: 'This could be a major . step towards helping millions around the world who are suffering from . Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. 'If we could boost the brain's ability to function, we may be able to counter dementias.' Researchers found the protein could raise IQ by up to six points - whatever . the age of the person taking it - raising the possibility that a drug could become available to make people cleverer. 'Our results suggest klotho may increase the brain's capacity to . perform everyday intellectual tasks,' said coauthor Lennart Mucke, . professor of neuroscience at the University of California San Francisco. People . who have one copy of a variant, or form, of the kloto gene, called . KL-VS, tend to live longer and have lower chances of suffering a stroke . whereas people who have two copies may live shorter lives and have a . higher risk of stroke. In . the study, researchers found that people who had one copy of the KL-VS . variant performed better on a battery of cognitive tests than subjects . who did not have it, regardless of age, sex or the presence of the . apolipoprotein 4 gene, the main genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's . disease. The investigators tested a variety of . cognitive skills, including learning, memory, and attention. More than . 700 subjects, 52 to 85 years old were tested as part of three studies. None . had any sign of dementia. Consistent with previous studies, 20 to 25 . per cent of the subjects had one copy of the KL-VS variant and performed . better on the tests than those who had no copies. Performance on the tests decreased with age regardless of whether a subject had one or no copies of the KL-VS gene variant. As part of the study, researchers genetically engineered mice to overproduce klotho protein . The klotho gene provides the blueprint for a protein made primarily by the cells of the kidney, placenta, small intestine, and prostate. A shortened version of the protein can circulate through the blood system. Blood tests showed that subjects who had one copy of the KL-VS variant also had higher levels of circulating klotho protein. The levels decreased with age as others have observed. The researchers speculate that the age-related decrease in circulating levels of klotho protein may have caused some of the decline in performance on the cognitive tests. Researchers then genetically engineered mice to overproduce klotho protein. The klotho-enhanced mice lived longer and had higher levels of klotho in the blood and in a brain area known as the hippocampus, which controls some types of learning and memory. Similar to human studies, the klotho-enhanced mice performed better on a variety of learning and memory tests, regardless of age.","U.S. study .

"By . Madlen Davies for MailOnline . A man who was told he would never walk again after a childhood brain tumour left him confined to a wheelchair has defied the odds stacked against him to become a personal trainer. Adam Low,  of Sunderland in Tyne and Wear, underwent emergency surgery for a brain tumour when he was just nine years old. But the tumour robbed the now 22-year-old of his sense of balance. He was left with permanent double vision and was confined to a wheelchair for the next two years, with specialists warning he would never stand or walk again. But after watching his school friends race around and play football in the park Mr Low was determined to defy their predictions. Adam Lowe, 22, of Sunderland in Tyne and Wear defied medics to become a personal trainer, even though doctors had told him he would never walk again after a childhood brain tumour left him in a wheelchair . With the help of an eye patch Mr Low (pictured left) eventually overcame his lack of balance and embarked on his dream career - as a fitness instructor (pictured right) During his childhood Adam Low endured gruelling physio sessions to teach him to walk again, and he was so determined to play football he would practice for another five or six hours a day . His resolve meant that over the course of his teens he slowly learned to stand and walk, then to run and play sports. And with the help of an eye patch he eventually overcame his lack of balance and embarked on his dream career - as a fitness instructor. Mr Low said it was devastating for a boy who loved sport to be told he would never walk again. He said: ‘They told me that I would never walk again. I was absolutely gutted - I loved sport, I loved playing football. ‘Lying in the hospital bed I was trying to get up on feet, mum and dad would help me down to try to stand up. ‘When I got home I saw my friends out playing football and I couldn’t do anything. The brain tumour left Mr Low with double vision, with balance problems, and unable to walk . Before being diagnosed with a brain tumour that was causing excruciating headaches, Mr Low loved sports and games, especially playing football with his friends . But practising every day meant he began to see positive results. He said: ‘I had one hour’s physio every other day but I would practise a good five to six hours every day. ‘I had to teach myself to walk again from scratch - it took a good two years. ‘But as soon as I started walking again, I noticed changes in myself, and I wanted to help others who had difficulty with fitness.’ Wanting to spend his life helping people, Mr Low launched a personal training business as soon as he left school . Mr Low started developing excruciating headaches as a boy and went to the doctors. Eventually he was sent to a specialist who recognised the symptoms and rushed him into surgery that same day. The operation was a success, removing 90 per cent of the life threatening tumour, but left him wheelchair-bound with severe balance problems. Determined not to give up on sport, he immediately started teaching himself how to walk and would get his parents to help him out of his hospital bed so he could attempt a few steps. He soon began gruelling hour-long physiotherapy sessions every other day, practising in his hallway for up to six hours a day, using the walls for balance. After two years he was finally able to walk and by the time he reached 15 he was back playing football with his friends. He decided he wanted to spend his life helping other people and after leaving school launched his own business, Adam Low Personal Training. He now hosts fitness classes, intense cardio sessions and goes to the gym himself five times a week. He said: ‘I knew as soon as I left school what I wanted to do. ‘I did my first qualification about four years ago when I was 18, ever since then I have been doing more. ‘My initial plan was to help people with disabilities, but I thought there wouldn’t be enough, so I started to help people who wanted to lose weight as well.’ He added that although he is still affected by his ordeal, his personal training allows him to focus on helping others achieve difficult goals. He said: ‘My balance is still not perfect; when I’m walking I sometimes stumble. ‘I’ve learnt to live with it and correct it and to just get on with it. Now the goal is inspire others to overcome their biggest challenges.’","As a child, Adam Low suffered excruciating headaches .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Scientist Dr Dean Burnett has created a list of features he predicts humans could evolve. It includes tentacles, colour-changing skin, flexible skeletons and selective hearing. The neuroscientist humorously notes that as evolution takes so long no one will be around to see his his predictions are right or wrong. Humans might one day evolve colour changing skin like the chameleon (pictured) according to one scientist's musings on evolution . Taking inspiration from the chameleon, humans could evolve the ability to consciously change their skin colour, he wrote in a blog for The Guardian. He muses that this could happen in humans evolved chomatophores - pigment-containing and light-reflecting organelles in cells found in reptiles - or even by using technology, but notes that whatever the case there are numerous evolutionary benefits. 'Being able to either visually blend in or stand out at will would be a potent advantage in modern society, one that evolutionary pressures could make more common,' he said. Dr Burnett points out that humans already have the ability to focus their hearing on certain conversations and noises, but the human ear does not have a physical mechanism for doing this. Will humans evolve tentacles like the squid pictured, to be able to interact with computers more easily? He believes that over time selective hearing could become more important - perhaps to filter out increasing noise from social media and other sources of continuous information. 'Rather than diverting attention to more relevant inputs, humans could develop the ability to actively 'tune out' things they don't want to hear, like closing your eyes to block an unpleasant sight,' he said. While this could result in humans taking in less information over all, Dr Burnett believes future humans might be less stressed and angry to live longer, happier lives. He said that in order for humans to use keyboards and touch screens to communicate with computers more easily, we could evolve more dexterous hands that allow us to make precise movements but are less rigid to help us type faster. As the world gets safer for most of us, there is less need for humans to have rigid and inflexible bones to withstand forceful impacts, says the scientist who thinks we could one day evolve flexible skeletons . They could even end up more like 'tentacles like those on a sea anemone,' he said. Noting that there might be limited practical reasons for humans to develop tentacles, he humorously suggests that they could be used for sexual selection as an alternative method of arousal. Humans could also develop more cartilage in their skeletons like sharks, which would have benefits such as being able to give birth more easily, he said. As the world gets safer for most of us, there is less need for humans to have rigid and inflexible bones to withstand forceful impacts. While Dr Burnett's suggestions for features that humans could evolve are just his own musings, new research has found that that humans could one day grow beaks. Dr Fraser, a biologist at Sheffield University,believes that humans will evolve constantly developing teeth thanks to 'tooth fairy' cells. He believes that human teeth are no longer fit for purpose and could even change into a beak that beak would not rot, chip or fall out.","Dr Dean Burnett muses that humans could evolve surreal new features to cope with our modern environment .

"By . Graham Poll . Follow @@MAIL_GPoll . ‘You are the best referees in the world and one of you will referee the ultimate football match – the World Cup final’. Those were the first words I heard as I sat in the opening seminar in the build up to Korea/Japan 2002. The excitement and anticipation doubled from what were already very high levels after flying into Seoul with many of my European refereeing colleagues. The heat is on: Sportsmail's Graham Poll attends a press conference in Toyko ahead of the 2002 World Cup . Most referees who are selected for the finals are aware that they travel more in hope than expectation of refereeing the final match but by being there they have a chance. Luck plays a huge part as some excellent referees miss out if their national team do well in the tournament or if one of their colleagues makes an error. For this reason there is a lot of fear within the refereeing camp and a sort of gallows humour once the games begin. First there are a series of fitness assessments and training to undertake as well as listening and understanding the final instructions as to what FIFA expect from you at this, the highest level. Of course when Howard Webb and his team of Mike Mullarkey and Darren Cann sit in their meeting in Rio they will be in a very different position – they have officiated that ‘ultimate’ match already.

Webb is the first referee in the modern game to return to the FIFA World Cup finals having done a final and knows that unless something extraordinary happens he will not referee the final this time around. The point is, given the way the appointment of the final referee has been done historically, it is unlikely that a UEFA referee will be appointed to the final. For now though all thoughts of the final match are put aside as you try to get over jet lag and acclimatise to the very different surroundings and conditions. I found it incredibly intimidating not speaking a word of the language in either South Korea or Japan and not even being able to read or understand the different alpha characters on shop fronts. Lost in translation: Italy's Pippo Inzaghi argues with Graham Poll and his team in 2002 . As the English referees experience this in Brazil they will be looking around their colleagues and wondering who will join them as World Cup Final officials. It could be that, given the relative inexperience of the group that a referee from Asia could be appointed for the final for the first time and Webb could get the opening match. That would be an exact reversal of the appointments four years ago when the Uzbek, Ravshan Irmatov, refereed South Africa vs Mexico and opened that tournament in style.","World Cup final is the ultimate game for referees .

"By . Gavin Madeley . Updated: . 19:15 EST, 27 December 2011 . Plea: Mary Queen of Scots sent a letter begging for her life . The fragile parchment, bearing royal insignia, was sent to a pope by a deposed monarch begging for her life. While the letter addressed to Sixtus V failed to save Mary, Queen of Scots from the executioner’s sword, the document itself has survived buried in the bowels of the Vatican’s secret archives for more than 400 years. It is among 100 of the most historically significant items of confidential correspondence due to go on public display for the first time in a special exhibition in Rome. The priceless collection spans more than a millennium, from the eighth century to modern times, and features a cast of historical characters who have crossed swords with a succession of pontiffs, from Knights Templar to Galileo, Martin Luther and Henry VIII. Mary wrote the missive from her prison cell at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire just three months before she was executed following her long incarceration. The priceless document was sent to Sixtus V and is kept in the Vatican's Secret Archives but it failed to save her life . The letter was written in French on . November 23, 1586. In it the Catholic Mary asks for forgiveness for her . sins, but also rails against perceived falsehoods perpetrated by her . enemies in England and warns the Pope of treacherous cardinals. She claims the tribunal that condemned her to death was illegitimate and . also recounts the suffering she had undergone during nearly 20 years of . imprisonment under the rule of her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth I. Mary had fled to England after an unsuccessful attempt to regain the . throne in Scotland. She initially sought protection from Elizabeth, but . because of the threat she was thought to have posed as the focus of . Catholic plotters who considered her the rightful ruler of England, she . was instead imprisoned before being tried for treason. A copy of the warrant for the execution of Mary Queen of Scots and is kept at the library of the Archbishop of Canterbury . Any hopes that the Pope would come to her rescue were dashed when Mary . was put to death  at Fotheringhay at 8am on February 8, 1587. The priceless document is normally kept with tens of thousands of others . on 50 miles of shelves in climate-controlled rooms in the Vatican’s . Apostolic Palace, as well as in a high-security underground bunker. Archivists have gathered them together for an exhibition to be held in . Rome’s Capitoline Museums to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the . founding of the Secret Archives in their present form. Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican’s official spokesman, said: ‘It’s . an exceptional event. Never have so many documents from the Secret . Archives been allowed to leave the Vatican.’ British visitors to the exhibition, entitled Lux in Arcana: The Vatican . Secret Archives Revealed, may be equally interested in an appeal by the . British Parliament asking the Pope to annul Henry VIII’s marriage to . Catherine of Aragon. Sent to Pope Clement VII in 1530, it failed to resolve the dispute, . which eventually led to religious schism and the founding of the Church . of England. It will be displayed alongside documents from the heresy trial of . Galileo Galilei, whose scientific theories that the Earth revolved . around the Sun attracted the hostility of the Catholic Church in the . early 17th century. Spoilt and petulant: Lord Darnley . Born on the 8 December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace Mary became Queen of Scots when she was six days old. As Hendry VII of England's great-granddaughter she was next in line to the English throne, after Henry VIII's children. She was due to marry Henry VIII's son, the future Edward VI after Scottish nobility decided to make peace with England, however, it was opposed by the Catholics and she was taken to Stirling Castle. Scotland returned to its traditional ally, France and Mary later married the French King Henri II's heir, Dauphin Francis on 24 April 1558. He succeeded to his father's throne in 1559 - making Mary Queen of France as well as Scotland but his reign was brief and he died in 1560 of an ear infection. The following year Mary decided to return to Scotland - which was now a Protestant country, after religious reforms led by John Knox. She was a Roman Catholic and was assured by her half-brother Lord James Stewart that she would be allowed to worship as she wished when she returned in August 1561. At first she ruled successfully and was advised by James and William Maitland of Lethington. But her marriage in 1565 to her second cousin Henry, Lord Darnley (who was the great-grandson of Henry VII) started a series of tragic events. Darnley, who was spoilt and petulant, had became the focus of her enemies and their relationship became difficult. The birth of their son, James, did little to improve it and when Darnley was murdered in 1567, people began to suspect she was involved. Her marriage three months later to the Earl of Bothwell - who was generally believed to be the murderer - brought her ruin and Protestant Lords rose against her in a battle at Carberry Hill, near Edinburgh, on June 15 1567. She later surrendered and was imprisoned in Lochleven Castle, Kinross-shire and forced to abdicate in favour of her son. Bothwell had fled but was arrested and held prisoner until his death. Mary escaped from Lochleven in 1568 and after another failed battle went to England where she hoped Queen Elizabeth I would support her cause but she was kept in captivity in England for 19 years. A number of Roman Catholic plots against Queen Elizabeth led her minister's to demand Mary's execution. She was executed at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire on Feburary 8 1587, aged 44. Mary, Queen of Scots was buried in Peterborough Cathedral but in 1612 her son James VI had her body exhumed and placed in the vault of King Henry VII's Chapel in Westminster Abbey.","Mary sent letter begging for her life to Sixtus V .

The 36-year-old celebrity blogger told show hosts Sonia Kruger and David Campbell his friendship with the 28-year-old superstar started to unravel after she got drunk and became upset with questions he asked her during an interview. But Perez truly believes Gaga's fame was the main reason their friendship fell apart. Scroll down for video . Feud origin: Perez Hilton appeared on the Mornings show on Tuesday and told about the origin of his public feud with former friend Lady Gaga . 'Actually, all the drama went down in . Australia in the summer of 2011,' the blogger, real name Mario . Lavandeira Jr, told the hosts. Perez said he was in Sydney hanging out with his then-friend and she was taking part in a special he was filming for television that included a cooking session with the singer. 'She proceeded to get obliterated drunk, drinking Jameson, and she was a surprisingly functioning drunk woman,' said Perez who was wearing a T-shirt that read 'Parental Advisory Explicit Content.' Perez said he was sober and interviewing Gaga when she became upset over a question about her single Judas. Singing superstar: Lady Gaga, shown earlier this month in New York City, asked her fans to stand down last year after her feud with Perez went public . 'The [question] framing made her real angry,' Perez recalled. He followed that up with a question about her boyfriend and he claimed that further angered the Poker Face singer. 'The fact that I brought up her boyfriend made her livid and she stormed off the set and stopped the interview,' Perez said. Harsh words: Mornings hosts David Campbelll and Sonia Kruger quizzed Perez about his relationship with Lady Gaga . The blogger said the blow-up made him re-evaluate his friendship with her. 'Now I feel like I think the whole time she was just using me,' Perez said. Sonia asked if maybe the Jameson whiskey played a role in her reaction and Perez dismissed that. Former friends: Lady Gaga and Perez are shown kissing in May 2009 in Irvine, California . 'No, I think it was fame that just poisoned her,' he said. 'She had an album Fame Monster, her second album, and she became consumed by that which she was fascinated about. You know, fame can be a very deadly drug and it has damaged her personally,' he said. He also said he no interest in rekindling their friendship. Happier times: Lady Gaga and Perez were close in September 2009 at her Video Music Awards after party in New York City . 'I have zero interest. I don't want to be her friend. I don't need friends like that in my life,' he said. He also blasted her latest artistic efforts. 'I think she has unfortunately become a victim of this character she created. Instead of being an artist she became this freak and this cartoon character and so unrelateable to people,' Perez said. Death threats: Perez, shown with son Mario earlier this month in New York City, received death threats after angering Lady Gaga's fans . The public feud between the two hit its height last August when Gaga released a 445-word statement urging her fans to stop sending death threats to her haters. The online storm broke after a fan alerted Gaga about a Perez sighting in her New York apartment building. 'STAY AWAY FROM ME + MY FAMILY YOU ARE SICK TRYING TO RENT AN APARTMENT IN MY BUILDING TO STALK ME. LEAVE ME ALONE!!!' the artist formerly known as Stefani Germanotta tweeted. Going strong: Lady Gaga, shown with her dog Asis on Tuesday in New York City, recently recorded a song with Tony Bennett . Perez followed that up with a 352-word posting on his popular website titled 'A Statement On LadyGaGa's Lies'. The blogger hit back after being deluged with death threats against him and his baby son from Gaga's obsessive fans. Gaga asked her fans to stand down and instead channel their anger through art.","Blogger championed Lady Gaga at the start of her career but they had a bitter falling out .

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Fears of a massive volcanic eruption in Iceland have been fuelled by yet another earthquake which has shifted 50million cubic metres of molten rock towards another volcano. It has been reported that a magnitude 4.5 quake hit a volcanic system close to the Bardarbunga volcano in the early hours of this morning with experts warning it could link up with the Askja volcanic system and cause a huge eruption. It comes after an earthquake reached a magnitude of 5.7 yesterday, potentially leading Iceland to yet again bring the warning code to red level. Scroll down for video . Shaken: Another earthquake has hit Iceland's Bardarbunga volcano, shifting 50million cubic metres of molten rock . The intense seismic activity at Iceland's largest volcano system has raised worries that an eruption could cause another ash cloud like that from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in 2010 that shut down much of Europe's airspace for six days. Experts say it is difficult to predict if volcanoes will erupt, however they say 50million cubic metres of molten rock has moved over the last 24 hours. Professor Bob White, from the University of Cambridge told BBC News: 'We know there is a lot of molten rock sitting under the ground beneath Askja, which is a major volcanic system. If this molten rock hits that, we know it is likely to trigger it to erupt. 'But who knows, it may just stop. It is still at five kilometres depth, and it is possible it could freeze there and not a lot more will happen. That is perfectly plausible. 'If it keeps going north, it keeps feeding molten rock and it hits the Askja system and triggers that - then goodness knows what will happen. It could make a lot of disruptive ash all over Iceland.' On Sunday, Iceland lowered its warning code for possible volcanic disruption to the aviation industry to orange from red, the highest level on the country's five-point alert system, after concluding that seismic activity had not led to a volcanic eruption under the glacier. Trembling times: Although the earthquake has not caused an eruption, there are fears of a repeat scenario of the Eyjafjallajokull ash cloud in 2010 . Bad boom: The 2010 eruption of a volcano under the Eyjafjallajokull glacier, pictured, severely disrupted European air travel for several weeks after ash spewed into the atmosphere . Red alert indicates an eruption is imminent or underway with a significant emission of ash likely. Met Office scientists believe the earthquakes are a result of magma flowing out from under the crater of the volcano, causing a change in pressure. ‘We still can't say whether it will cease, continue like this for a while or erupt. It's impossible to say,’ Palni Erlendsson, a geologist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office said. There have been thousands of smaller quakes over the past week at Bardarbunga, and areas around the volcano, in the centre of the North Atlantic island nation, have been evacuated. However, before an eruption air travel will not be affected, a spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said last week. 'The (UK) Met Office will be monitoring what's occurring. They will be sending out forecasts about the atmosphere and any ash in the air,' he said. 'If the eruption does occur we will issue what's called a notice to airmen informing them of the conditions. It's then up to the airlines with their safety teams and experts whether to fly.'","Yet another earthquake hits close to the Bardarbunga volcano in Iceland .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Error messages that pop up on Windows computers could enable the National Security Agency to spy on PC users, according to a report. The error messages appear when a Windows programme stops working or 'freezes' and a computer user can choose to send an error report to Microsoft to highlight the problem, which is designed to help Microsoft engineers improve their products and fix bugs. However, conscientious computer users might be sending reports to the NSA as well as the tech giant, a report by German magazine Der Spiegel suggests. Error messages that pop up on Windows computers could enable the National Security Agency to spy on PC users, according to a report. The error messages appear when a Windows programme stops working or freezes and a computer user can choose to send an error report to Microsoft to highlight the problem . News that the reports are being sent to the controversial organisation’s top hacking unit, the Tailored Access Operations (TAO) division, come from the latest leaked documents from Edward Snowden, The Huffington Post reported. The crash reports are a ‘neat way’ of gaining ‘passive access' to a computer, according to an NSA presentation obtained by Der Spiegel. Conscientious computer users might be sending reports to the NSA as well as Microsoft after a programme has crashed, a report suggests . Official hackers can reportedly pick out interesting error message reports using powerful software, which could tell the NSA about the vulnerabilities of a certain computer. Computer security expert, Graham Clueley, told MailOnline that any possible snooping is not limited to U.S. citizens and could affect Britons, as the NSA is largely interested in spying on people outside the country. 'It's yet another method that could find weaknesses in a computer, which they could exploit,' he said. While there is no evidence to suggest that British intelligence agencies are using the same technique, Mr Clueley said it 'would not be a massive shock' if it was later discovered that they were, as the NSA and GCHQ have used a variety of similar methods to snoop on people in the past. A graphic within the presentation hints that NSA agents made fun of how easy the error message trick made their jobs. Designed to look just like a genuine Microsoft error report popup, it says: ‘A log of this error has been created. Please tell Microsoft about this problem. This information may be intercepted by a foreign SIGINT system to gather detailed information and better exploit your machine.’ Microsoft has been in the spotlight since July when Mr Snowden began his leaks, including that the tech giant might have given the NSA access to customers’ encrypted messages as well as data. The company has recently tried to allay customer fears by obstructing U.S. agencies’ bids to access Microsoft’s foreign customers’ data. A Microsoft spokesman told The Huffington Post: ‘Microsoft does not provide any government with direct or unfettered access to our customer's data. ‘We would have significant concerns if the allegations about government actions are true.' News that the reports are being sent to the controversial organisation's top hacking unit, the Tailored Access Operations division, are thought to have come from the latest leaked documents from Edward Snowden (pictured) Former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who revealed details of electronic surveillance by American and British spy services, warned of the dangers posed by a loss of privacy in a Channel 4's 'Alternative Christmas Message'. In a two-minute video recorded in Moscow, where Snowden has been granted temporary asylum, he spoke of concerns over surveillance in an age of huge technological advancement. 'We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go. Think about what this means for the privacy of the average person,' he said. 'A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all,' said Snowden. 'They'll never know what it means to have a private moment to themselves, an unrecorded, unanalysed thought. And that's a problem because privacy matters, privacy is what allows us to determine who we are and who we want to be.' The 'Alternative Christmas Message', broadcast annually on Channel 4 television since 1993, mimics the format of the yearly address to the nation by Queen Elizabeth. On Tuesday, Snowden - who disclosed thousands of confidential documents - said in an interview published in the Washington Post that he had achieved what he set out to do. 'For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished,' he said. Last week a White House-appointed panel proposed curbs on some key NSA surveillance operations, recommending limits on a programme to collect records of billions of telephone calls, and new tests before Washington spies on foreign leaders.","Computer users might be sending reports to the NSA when they think they are sending them to Microsoft, according to a report by Der Spiegel .

"By . Lucy Crossley . and Lucy Osborne . and Lizzie Edmonds . Desperation: Paul and Sandra Dunham, who are facing extradition to the US over fraud charges, have revealed they tried to kill themselves in order to avoid prison . The British couple facing extradition to America over an expenses row were remanded in custody last night due to fears they could make a fresh suicide attempt. It came after retired businessman Paul Dunham and his wife Sandra, both 58, admitted they took a drug overdose earlier this week to avoid the prospect of dying in a US jail. The couple had been due to hand themselves to police at 10am on Thursday, before being passed to US authorities. But officers rushed to their £600,000 home in Northampton at 7.15am after concerns were raised over their welfare. Speaking from his hospital bed at Northampton General yesterday, Mr Dunham said:  ‘When we felt there was no hope, the prospect of what lay ahead of us in the US, we felt that wasn’t worth living for.’ 'If you look statistically, white collar crime has a 98 per cent chance of going to a plea bargain. 'If you look at this in the cold light of day we have gone through this rationally so many times in our minds. 'Somewhere down the line someone is either going to offer us a ridiculously long prison sentence or a plea bargain. 'We could easily be in the US for six or eight years. 'We would return to the UK in our mid-sixties, with no money, no jobs and no home. 'Frankly that was a prospect we didn’t feel like enduring eight years of hell for.' Last month the couple lost a High Court . battle last month against extradition to Maryland to stand trial over . fraud charges relating to Mr Dunham's company, Pace. Mr Dunham is accused of over-claiming . $1million (£600,000) in expenses when he was chief executive of US firm . PACE and his wife of aiding and abetting him. They insist these were ‘wholly legitimate’ business expenses. The case has caused anger over the . use of the Extradition Act to haul them across the Atlantic for trial . for what their supporters say amounts to a civil dispute. Mrs Dunham is accused of eight counts of fraud for allegedly aiding and abetting him. The Dunhams' failed High Court case . heard that Mr Dunham had suffered several mini-strokes and mental health . problems, and Mrs Dunham was suffering from depression. Emergency: Police were called to the Dunhams' Northampton home by a worried journalist who had arrived to take a statement from the couple - only for them to fail to answer the door . The couple, who have five . grandchildren, 'vehemently reject' allegations relating to expenses . claims by Mr Dunham while he was working in the US, arguing the spending . was sanctioned by Pace's board and that auditors raised no objections. Speaking yesterday, Mr Dunham said the final straw for the couple had come when they learned that Home Secretary had cancelled a planned meeting with their MP Andrea Leadsom. 'On Wednesday evening, we were really just hanging on,' he said. 'That evening we got an email from MP Andrea Leadsom saying Theresa May had cancelled her meeting with her. Treatment: The Dunhams both spent the night at Northampton General Hospital and are expected to be taken to Westminster Magistrates court when they are discharged . 'Andrea has worked tirelessly for us - but the people that should care just don’t seem to want to be involved. 'We rationally weighted up all the options and saw no other choice. 'We faced a three year wait for a . trial in the US and we were already told we were going to be held in a . high security super max prison with a pretty harsh regime and it . wouldn’t have the medical facilities for my health. 'We were facing the prospect of enduring eight years of hell, and are still facing the same dilemma. Denial: The couple, who have five grandchildren, 'vehemently reject' allegations relating to expenses claims by Mr Dunham while he was working in the US . 'It’s a bit like when someone has a . terminal illness, they will sometimes end their lives with the happy . memories they once had rather than face the terminal illness. 'What we did wasn’t a publicity stunt, . we fully expected not to be here today and we have to be grateful for . the police and hospital staff for how they have looked after us over the . last 24 hours. 'Now we are having to go to separate counselling meetings where we are really saying ""what’s next?"" 'Nothing’s really changed, the extradition warrant still exists and that hasn’t changed at all.' A journalist from a local newspaper had arrived at the couple's £500,000 detached home to speak to them but police were alerted when there was no response from the pair. Officers forced the door open and contacted paramedics, who arrived in two ambulances and took the couple to hospital. Officers from Northamptonshire Police forced entry to the property after a reporter from the local newspaper dialled 999. Mr Dunham said: 'A local reporter came . to interview us because they knew we would be leaving, they had planned . to meet us as we came out the front door. 'They got suspicious, didn’t see anyone around, once several minutes passed he got concerned and called police. 'I expect to be in hospital for a day . or two to get over the effects and then we are hoping we will have some . additional psychological counselling to see whether we can muster the . strength to face this ordeal.' Mr Dunham added that his wife has been taken off a drip and is feeling 'very shaken' and is 'struggling to sit up.' Fear: Mr Dunham says the couple face a three year wait for a trial in the US, and would be held in a high security prison .","Paul and Sandra Dunham remanded over fears of another suicide attempt .

Height: Pacquiao will put his WBO welterweight title on the line against Algieri on November 23 in Macau . Ready? Pacquiao posed for photographs with his opponent in Macau on Monday and labelled him 'not bad' Algieri will be quick to remind the confident Pacquiao of his major upset in June, as Russian Ruslan Provodnikov lost by a split decision. Pacquiao, however, watched the fight and remains unmoved. 'I saw his fight with Ruslan,'  said the 35-year-old. 'He took a lot of bad punches from Ruslan but he's tough. He can box. I'm not saying he's really good but he's not bad. He's okay.' Algieri, at 5ft 10in, has the height advantage  over his 5ft 6.5in counterpart, which PacMan recognises. 'The biggest challenge for me is to fight another tall guy. I have to use my speed and footwork for this fight.' Algieri started slow against Provodnikov before coming out on top - a mistake he knows he cannot afford to make against the punishing Pacquiao. 'First round I made a mistake,' said Algieri. 'Paid for it for the next 11-and-a-half rounds. Got a little too aggressive too early against a very dangerous guy.' Man of many talents: Pacquiao remains player-coach of the Philippines basketball team but took a break . 'Okay': Pacquiao saw his upcoming opponent beat Russian Ruslan Provodnikov and recognises he is 'tough' Provodnikov and Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, remains respectful of the towering American. 'It surprised me because I actually think Ruslan won that fight. (Algieri) got beat up a little bit,' he said. 'Algieri has a good reach advantage and we're going to have to get past that and his jab. That will be our biggest problem. We have ways to do that.' One of Roach's latest endeavours is to help Pacquiao manage his role as player-coach of the Philippines basketball team. 'We came to an agreement that four weeks before a fight he will stop playing (basketball) because of injuries. We negotiated that deal a long time ago,' he said. 'He's always busy. I don't think it's a problem.'","Manny Pacquiao on upcoming opponent Chris Algieri: 'He can box. I'm not saying he's really good but he's not bad. He's okay'

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Any baby that survives a premature birth is considered by their parents to be a miracle. But for Kate and Renato Douse, their daughter is extra special. For little Maddalena is one of the smallest premature babies ever to survive in the UK - and it's all thanks to a pair of scissors. Born at just 23 weeks, doctors were unsure whether she would survive, or whether they should try and save her. Had it not been for a pair of scissors on the scales - bumping up her weight - doctors would not have fought to save the life of premature Maddalena Douse, with parents Kate and Renato . Current ethical guidelines in the UK on the care . of very premature infants do not suggest providing active care for . babies born at 22 weeks six days and earlier. But when they put her on the scales she . weighed 1lb, the minimum weight for a baby to be considered viable, so they fought to keep her alive. It was only when she was safely on a ventilator . that doctors discovered a pair of scissors had been accidentally left on the . scales and that Maddalena actually only weighed 382g. Born at just 23 weeks, doctors were unsure whether Maddalena would survive, or whether they should try and save her . Now six months old, she has been discharged from the Royal Sussex Hospital and is expected to . grow into a healthy child. Very premature babies born around 24 weeks go to neonatal intensive care units, although their parents often opt for withdrawal of care at some point when the medical outlook for the child worsens. Babies born before this time struggle because their lungs and other vital organs are not developed enough. It was only when she was safely on a ventilator that doctors discovered Maddalena had actually only weighed 382g. Guidelines state a baby must be 1lb to be considered viable . Maddalena's mother Kate, 31, of Lewes, East Sussex, told The Sun: 'We never thought we’d ever bring Maddalena home. 'She . now weighs 5½lbs and is getting stronger by the day. She’s our little . miracle and we’re so glad to have her home in time for Christmas.' She and her husband Renato, a plumber, had already suffered heartache when Maddalena’s twin Isabella died a few weeks after the sisters were born. Now six months old, Maddalena  has been discharged from the Royal Sussex Hospital and is expected to grow into a healthy child . Earlier this month, research Medical Research Council (MRC) found that more premature babies born when their . mothers are just 24 weeks pregnant are surviving - but babies delivered . earlier rarely live. Their research appeared to find a cut-off point in terms of chances of survival at 24 weeks - . the current legal limit for abortion. But they found no improvement in the proportion of babies born 22-25 weeks who experience serious health problems into childhood . The figures suggest that while rising numbers of babies born very early are being helped to survive, the number of children and adults with long-term disability as a result will also increase.","Maddalena Douse, from Lewes, East Sussex, was born at just 23 weeks .

Mary said: 'If I leave Arwen with the iPad then she can open the app and take a picture of herself. 'Her selfies aren’t great - mainly of the tops of her head or her tummy but she’s getting there.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . From slipping into a bikini to pulling on your dream wedding dress, losing weight is easy when you've got a goal in mind. But for full-time mother, Georgina Baird, 26, from Southampton, it was the promise of a boob job that helped her shed more than half her body weight. 5ft 1"" Mrs Baird, who had been a morbidly obese 17st 8lb and a size 20, is now a svelte size 8 and weighs just 8st. Scroll down for video . Looking good: Mother-of-three Georgina Baird lost nine stone after being offered a boob job by her father . Mrs Baird had tried scores of different diets, all with little success, before her concerned father Simon Clayton, 56, hit upon the idea of offering to pay for breast enhancement if she managed to lose weight. 'It was such a kind gesture,' reveals a thrilled Mrs Baird. 'Dad just wanted to see me . healthy but he knew I never managed to stick to the diets for long and . so he offered me the surgery as a prize because he knew it would keep me . motivated. 'I can’t thank him enough because not only did it mean I finally lost the weight, but I’m also confident with my bust too. 'For . the first time ever I finally like what I see in the mirror and I can’t . thank my dad enough because there is no greater prize than health and . happiness.' Unhealthy: Georgina's problems began after the birth of son Oliver, now six, when she was diagnosed with PND . Concerned: Father Simon Clayton was so worried about her 17st 8lb bulk, he offered to pay for a boob job . Getting better: Georgina embarked on a healthy eating plan and the pounds soon began to fall off . Mrs Baird's battle with her weight began when she was 20 following the birth of her second son Oliver, now six. Already a mother to Louis, now eight, she succumbed to severe postnatal depression and her weight rocketed. 'I’d always been about a size 12 but after having Oliver, instead of getting smaller, I just got bigger and bigger,' explains Mrs Baird. Despite vowing to lose the four stone she’d gained during the pregnancy, after the birth she quickly gained another three thanks to her penchant for chocolate and fizzy drinks. 'I was diagnosed with PND and turned to chocolate and sugary drinks to try and give myself a quick boost of energy because I felt so lethargic all the time,' she reveals. 'I was soon trapped in a vicious cycle and because I hated the way I looked so much I binged on more sweets and chocolate to feel better.’ When her relationship with the children’s father ended, she grew even more depressed and began to see food as a crutch. 'I’m so short that I looked like a cannon ball,' she remembers. 'All the weight seemed to go to my stomach.’ So pronounced was her tummy, Mrs Baird regularly found herself being asked, much to her embarrassment, whether she was pregnant again. 'A friend pointed to me tummy and asked when I was due,' she remembers. 'I just shook my head and made a joke of it. It wasn’t her fault. 'I was so fat I did look pregnant. I think she was more embarrassed than me.’ Mrs Baird's weight peaked at 17st 8lbs, 18 months after her son was born, but at just 5ft 1ins tall, she soon began to suffer pins and needles in her hands and feet - a consequence, her doctor told her, of being morbidly obese. 'I’d buried my head in the sand,' says Mrs Baird. 'I had no idea I had gotten that big - I had been kidding myself because it was easier not to face the truth. Now it was beginning to have an impact on my health.' And Mrs Baird wasn't the only one to worry. Her father Simon Clayton, the manager of a chemical plant, was also concerned. Happy: A size 14 when she met husband Elliott, 31, she was a svelte size 8 by the time they married in Mexico . Almost there: By June 2013, Georgina had hit her target weight and the same month, had her £4,000 boob job . Overjoyed: Georgina says she now has the body she's always dreamed of and is thrilled . ‘I knew Dad was worried about me,' remembers Mrs Baird. 'He had been dropped gentle hints about me losing weight but only because he wanted me to be healthy. 'He was worried about me and he knew I would never be happy again unless I lost weight.’ Despite trying a litany of different diets, Mrs Baird's weight problems continued. Compounding her misery was the fact that when she did lose a few pounds, they always seemed to go from her bust. 'One day I was moaning to my sisters about the fact that the only part of me that looked OK was my bust and that if I lost weight it would be the first thing to go,' says Mrs Baird. 'Dad overheard and promised that if I did lose all the weight he would pay for surgery on my bust. It meant I had no excuse anymore.' Excited at the prospect to surgery, Mrs Baird swung into action, swapping unhealthy takeaways for grilled meat and salad, while fizzy drinks were exchanged for water and green tea. ‘Dad assured me he meant what he had said and that really kept me motivated,' says Mrs Baird. 'It almost felt like a competition because there was such a wonderful prize in sight. 'Dad knew as a mother of three I could never afford surgery myself.’ She had already shrunk to a size 14 when she met her now husband Elliot, 31, a landscape gardener, in 2010 and continued to follow her healthy eating plan when she became pregnant with her youngest son Finley, now three. 'Obviously I gained baby weight but because I was losing fat through healthy eating, one balanced out the other,' says Mrs Baird. 'My GP monitored me throughout and was perfectly happy there was no risk at all to my baby.' After the birth, she began running three times a week and working out at the gym. And when she married in September 2012 in Mexico, she was a slender size 8. But much to her horror, her once voluptuous bust had shrunk to a tiny 32AA. 'I hated them,' adds Mrs Baird. 'I even had special cups fitted into the dress to try and add some shape.' By June 2013, Mrs Baird hit her target weight of 8st and was duly given her reward, having surgery at the Transform clinic in London the same month. 'It had been a long process to lose the weight so I’d had plenty of time to research the procedure and it’s not a decision I took lightly,' she explains. 'Losing the weight had left me with nothing at all. I just wanted to look natural.’ Her £3,995 prize increased her assets to a 32DD and father Simon says it was worth every penny to finally see his daughter happy and more importantly healthy again. 'Dad raised my three siblings and me by himself so we were already very close but what he has done means the world to me,' adds Mrs Baird. ‘I definitely have the best dad in the world.’ For more information about Transform visit Transform Cosmetic Surgery, see transforminglives.co.uk  or call  0800 655 6406.","Georgina Baird, 26, from Southampton, weighed 17st 8lb and was a size 20 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Jailed: Dr Conrad Murray accused Jackson's mother of 'failing' her son . The doctor convicted of the involuntary manslaughter of Michael Jackson has made a shocking attack on the singer's mother. Conrad Murray accused 82-year-old Katherine Jackson of letting him down and 'failing to be there' while he was alive. Murray, 59, hit out when he was asked if he would would beg her forgiveness for giving the insomniac superstar a cocktail of drugs on the night of his death three years ago. He said: 'Mrs Jackson does not have to forgive for the death of her son because I am not responsible for his death. There is nothing for her to forgive me for. 'I would say this: Is anyone willing to ever forgive Mrs Jackson for failing to be the mother she could have been for her son? Would Michael forgive his mother for not being the mother that he wanted to be there all the time?' Murray, serving four years at Los Angeles County Jail, said he would 'more than happy' to sit down with Mrs Jackson and talk about her son. The doctor was living with the 50-year-old singer at his mansion in LA's Holmy Hills when Jackson died on June 25, 2009. He had been preparing for a huge British tour. At Murray's trial, the court heard that he administered drugs to his patient and then left him alone for long periods while he spoke to girlfriends as the star lay in bed. In a telephone call from the jail, Murray showed no remorse about his role in Jackson's death and claimed he was closer to his children, Prince,15, Paris, 14, and 10-year-old Blanket, than the star's own family. Fallout: Singer Michael Jackson and his mother Katherine who gets an allowance from his £650 million estate . In an interview in the Sun, Murray stirred up the massive family fall-out over his £650 million will, by alleging 85-year-old father Joe Jackson could be getting money from his son's fortune. Murray claimed Joe, who has been accused of beating his son when he was a child, might be enjoying payouts from the allowance Katherine gets from the estate. 'She is probably handing out funds to his father,' said Murray. 'He would roll in his grave if he knew that Joe Jackson spent a penny of his money.' Last month police were called to the children's Californian home in Calabasas when Jackson's siblings, Janet, Randy and Jermaine tried to take them away. Their brother Tito has now been named co-guardian. Jackson's children: Prince, Blanket, centre, and Paris. Murray claims he was close to them . Murray, who began his sentence nine months ago, still maintains his innocence and claimed Jackson injected himself with Propofol, a drug used as a sedative on patients before operations. For his own safety the disgraced doctor is kept away from other inmates - an experience he has found 'demoralising'. He plans to cash in Jackson in the future by revealing more secrets about his celebrity patient. But he claimed he would not 'betray' the singer. 'One day I will tell the story. I will tell the story in full,' he said.","'I am not responsible for his death', says jailed medic Conrad Murray .

"By . James Rush . Created: . 11:18 EST, 3 March 2014 . An investment banker who claims a man with the same name stood in for him at his own wedding has failed in his attempt to avoid a big money divorce suit. Former top-earning UBS banker Amit Goyal, 36, told a judge his headhunter wife Ankita 'married another Amit Goyal' at a ceremony at a four star hotel. He said he was relaxing at home six hours away while the service was taking place. Amit Goyal (left), 36, told a judge his headhunter wife Ankita (right) 'married another Amit Goyal' at a ceremony at a four star hotel . The high-flying city couple, who lived at Canary Wharf, London, met on Indian dating site Shaadi.com. They were married on September 15, 2003, in the Indian city of Meerut - but Mr Goyal insists he was 'not present at the ceremony'. He claimed his 33-year-old wife could neither divorce him, nor claim any financial support, because they were never married in the first place. However, Judge Mark Everall QC granted Mrs Goyal a decree nisi last year after describing her husband as an 'unreliable' witness and ruling that 'there was a valid marriage between the couple'. Challenging that decision at the Court of Appeal, Mr Goyal pointed to a mysterious thumb print on his marriage certificate - and an absence of wedding photos - in a bid prove himself a bachelor. In his judgement, Judge Everall also said that Mr Goyal was £300,000 in debt - despite earning £185,000-a-year, plus bonuses, before he was made redundant. The Hotel Samrat Heavens, in the Indian city of Meerut, where the marriage between Ankita Goyal and Amit Goyal took place . His complaints were thrown out by the judge, who said he had 'no prospect' of blocking his wife's divorce petition. Mr Goyal met his wife on the Indian matrimonial website in 2003. He had then been accepted to study at the 'very prestigious' INSEAD business school in Paris, having worked in London since 2002, but agreed to meet his prospective bride back in his homeland. The pair became engaged three days after they met and a wedding was fixed for the following month with the consent of Mrs Goyal’s senior army officer father. Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Goyal said she was 'very happy' at the outcome which would have 'massive implications' for her future . 'Mrs Goyal and her parents were happy to go along with the plan. Mr Goyal was a well-educated young man with evidently good prospects in the well-paid world of international finance,' Judge Everall said in his ruling. He flew to New Delhi and his fiancee’s family arranged a 'short marriage ceremony', in advance of the full festivities, in order to speed along her French visa application prior to the couple’s flight to Europe. However, the banker asserted that his wife tied the knot with an imposter at Meerut’s luxury Hotel Samrat Heavens, claiming that he had been six hours’ away in his home town, Bathinda, on the morning of the nuptials. 'His case is that Mrs Goyal and he were not married on September 15, 2003; he was not present at any ceremony that may have taken place on that day. His case is that she married another man that day,' Judge Everall explained. Mr Goyal said this meant his subsequent 'marriage', celebrated just three days later, was invalid - even though the groom’s name on the wedding certificate for the previous ceremony matched his own. The pair moved to France and then the UK, before their daughter, now six, was born in 2007. But their relationship 'irretrievably broke down' and Mrs Goyal moved out of their Docklands home in 2011. Mr Goyal claimed that he had 'not read the certificate carefully enough' in 2003 and that the first time he noticed the discrepancies in the dates was more than a year after the relationship ended. Judge Everall heard expert evidence that a photograph, supposedly depicting the groom on the marriage certificate, was not of Mr Goyal, and a thumb print on the document, which was purportedly his, belonged to someone else. The expert also highlighted a number of 'oddities' about the registration of the marriage. 'Standing back and having regard to . all the evidence and Judge Everall’s reasoning, I do not detect that he . had any real difficulty in arriving at his conclusion. Indeed, . having regard to his finding that Mr Goyal’s evidence pointed to him . being unreliable, it seems to me that the conclusion to which he came . was, in reality, the only one which was open to him' - Lord Justice Kitchin . Nonetheless, the judge said that 'the overwhelming probability on all the evidence is that Mrs Goyal did not marry, and did not intend to marry, a different Amit Goyal on 15th September, 2003. 'Why should she do so? Why should she do this on September 15 and then marry Mr Goyal on September 18 and fly with him to France?' the judge asked. Mr Goyal was a 'highly educated and intelligent man' who had worked for Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS and who was 'precise and careful'. But the judge said of him: 'I did not find him a satisfactory witness'. Rejecting his claim that he did not check the marriage papers until long after the split, the judge said his evidence about that was 'unconvincing and implausible'. 'I find there was a valid marriage between Mrs Goyal and Mr Goyal on September 15, 2003, in Meerut, India,' the judge concluded, before formally ending their union. On appeal, Mr Goyal argued in person that it 'simply was not possible' that he could have made the ceremony in time, because he was in Bathinda at 9am on the day of the wedding. Pointing to the lack of wedding snaps, he said: 'Marriage is the one of the most sacred things in the Hindu religion. If you say to someone there is a marriage without photographs, it simply does not add up.' But Lord Justice Kitchin said: 'Standing back and having regard to all the evidence and Judge Everall’s reasoning, I do not detect that he had any real difficulty in arriving at his conclusion. 'Indeed, having regard to his finding that Mr Goyal’s evidence pointed to him being unreliable, it seems to me that the conclusion to which he came was, in reality, the only one which was open to him.' The judge concluded: 'I’m satisfied there is no prospect of success in this application. It must therefore be dismissed.' Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Goyal said she was 'very happy' at the outcome which would have 'massive implications' for her future.","Amit Goyal told judge his wife Ankita 'married another Amit Goyal'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . One in four voters backing another party might support Labour if Ed Miliband was replaced as leader, a poll has found. In a nationwide Opinium poll for the Daily Mail, 25 per cent of those who had already decided to vote for another party at the general election next May said ditching him could swing their vote. The poll will pile pressure on Labour, who face being pushed into second place by Ukip in next week’s European elections. Liability: According to a poll, many voters are put off voting Labour because of Ed Miliband . Only 8 per cent of the more than 2,000 people surveyed this week said they would be less likely to vote Labour if Mr Miliband were no longer in charge. Mr Miliband was asked on Channel 4 News last night: ‘Why are you doing so badly?’ He floundered, finally saying: ‘Let’s see what happens. I don’t accept [that]’. Labour fell below the Conservatives in two opinion polls this week for the first time in two years, although yesterday they regained a three-point lead. Surveys show most voters back Labour’s message on lowering the cost of living, but do not see Mr Miliband as prime minister. Typo: Election guru David Axelrod, right, failed to spell his boss's name correctly on Twitter . On current predictions, Labour is still set to emerge as the largest party in 2015. The quirks of the system mean the Tories need a 6 per cent lead for a majority. Embarrassingly, Mr Miliband’s election guru David Axelrod, who is on a six-figure salary, got his boss’s name wrong on Twitter yesterday. The US strategist spelled Miliband with two l’s, inadvertently linking to a spoof account mocking the leader.","Miliband's departure could tempt over 25 per cent of voters, poll finds .

Photographer Martin Tremblay, aka Le Pinch, shot the images for a British fashion magazine. Each portrait blends reality with surrealist settings in a curious, inverted world. In an MailOnline exclusive, the photographer here reveals the secret behind his surreal, gravity-defying shoot. Topsy-turvy: Models appear suspended upside down in an unusual magazine shoot . He explained how the mind-boggling images were created using computer trickery. 'First I shot many backgrounds with a little lighting punch of flash,' says Tremblay, 44, from Montréal, Quebec. 'After, we shot the models In studio with a trampoline to make it fit on the selected images. 'I made a ceiling with cardboard to flatten down the hair. I shot the shoes after and put everything together in Photoshop.' Despite seemingly floating at zero gravity, models retain utmost elegance, and the surreal compositions in Far Eastern urban settings compliment the beautiful clothes. Tremblay plays with ideas of reality, creating wacky hair styles and using props (and even pets) to add to the optical illusion.

"By . Pa Reporter . Fulham supporters called for manager Felix Magath to be sacked as the Cottagers slumped to a fifth defeat in six Sky Bet Championship games. The visitors finished with 10 men as they slumped 3-0 at Reading, adding to the pressure on manager Magath who only joined in February. Reading won at a canter with a pair of headers from on-loan striker Glenn Murray, on his debut, and a late effort from Nick Blackman. Glenn Murray celebrates after scoring a brace for Reading against Fulham . Murray beat Gabor Kiraly to the ball to score his second of the day with a header .

Fulham's cause was rendered almost lost as early as the 18th minute, when former Leeds striker Matt Smith, also on debut, was sent off for a lunge on Hope Akpan. The west London club endured a miserable end to last season, winning only three matches out of 12 under Magath as they were relegated from the Barclays Premier League. Fulham have started the Championship similarly poorly, losing their opening four matches before earning their first point in a 1-1 draw with Cardiff. It hardly got any better for them at the Madejski Stadium, where they were a goal down and a man down before having the chance to settle into the game. Fulham had begun brightly, with Ross McCormack volleying over from close range after a Smith header. But they went behind in the 15th minute from Reading's first meaningful attack, led by Jordan Obita along the left flank. Obita crossed early and Murray, on loan from Crystal Palace until January, dived forward to head in from close range for his first goal for the club.

Fulham responded well, with Tim Hoogland denied only by a last-ditch tackle from Chris Gunter and Chris David forcing a fine save from home goalkeeper Adam Federici. But Reading swiftly assumed control, with Murray and Gunter going close from well-struck efforts. The Reading pressure continued after the interval, with Simon Cox volleying straight at Fulham goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly. Kiraly, on his debut, was in action soon after, making a stunning save to keep out a powerful strike from Jake Taylor. But the pressure inevitably told, with a second goal arriving in the 54th minute when Murray nodded in a precise corner from Obita from close range. It was too much for the 2,745 Fulham fans, who voiced their displeasure at manager Magath. ""You're getting sacked in the morning"" was followed by further choruses of ""Felix out"". The visitors could have been swamped. Kiraly tipped a header from home substitute Pavel Pogrebnyak - a former Fulham player - against the crossbar and Taylor drove narrowly wide from distance. But they could not hold out at 2-0 until the end. In the 85th minute, substitute Blackman ran through, went by Kiraly and slotted the ball home.

Beijing-based Reignwood Investments have paid £135m to restaurant entrepreneur Richard Caring for the respected Wentworth golf club. The new owners have said that they will retain the Surrey course's 'unique culture'. The course is the host of the annual PGA tournament. 'Wentworth is a key strategic acquisition for our rapidly growing luxury lifestyle division,' said Dr Chanchai Ruayrungruang, the founder of the group behind the first private golf club in China.

Richard Caring, himself a keen golfer, revealed that he had received innumerable offers to buy the course during the nine years of his stewardship. 'I have always looked for an owner with integrity... an understanding of the special place it holds in so many people's hearts,' he said, 'an owner who wants to develop the club ever further, improving on what is already a masterpiece.'

In 1920, George Tarrant began developing the land around the house, Wentworths. In 1924, Tarrant's friend Harry Colt designed the East Course and three years later the West Course but the timing was poor and in 1931 Tarrant went bankrupt. The ownership of the land passed to Wentworth Estates Ltd. The headquarters of the PGA European Tour is located at the club, and each year it hosts the Tour's PGA Championship. It was the venue of the 1953 Ryder Cup and the World Match Play Championship from 1964 until 2007. The Edinburgh Course was opened in 1990. The club is located in Virginia Water, Surrey, one of the most expensive private estates in the London suburbs. It is home to a number of golfers and celebrities including Nick Faldo and Sir Bruce Forsyth (pictured left on the course during the PGA Pro-Am Tournament).

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Does our sun have any brothers and sisters and, if so, where are they? That’s a question that has puzzled astronomers, who think that our sun most likely formed in a molecular cloud along with other stars. But now a simulation has predicted that we should be able to find such siblings, because all stars born from the same cloud have a similar chemical 'fingerprint’. Scroll down for animations showing the simulation . Astrophysicists at the University of California have simulated star formation. They show that stars born of the same cloud have similar 'fingerprints'. This information could be used to find stars that were born from the same molecular cloud as our sun (shown) - even if they are the other side of the galaxy . Stars are made mostly of hydrogen and helium, but they also contain trace amounts of other elements, such as carbon, oxygen, iron, and even more exotic substances. By carefully measuring the wavelengths (colors) of light coming from a star, astronomers can determine how abundant each of these trace elements is. For any two stars at random, the abundances of their trace elements will slightly differ: one star may have a bit more iron, the other a bit more carbon, and so on. However, astronomers have known for more than a decade that any two stars within the same gravitationally bound star cluster always show the same abundances. Being able to measure this 'fingerprint' is potentially very useful, because stellar families usually do not stay together. Most stars are born as members of star cluster, but over time they drift apart and migrate across the galaxy. Their abundances, however, are set at birth. Thus, astronomers have long wondered if it might be possible to tell if two stars that are now on opposite sides of the galaxy were born billions of years ago from the same giant molecular cloud. And now, according to the latest simulations, it seems like this might be possible. The simulation was devised by astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Their results, published in Nature, show that stars born from the same cluster will share a chemical fingerprint with each other. This can then be used to trace them to the same birthplace. ‘We can see that stars that are part of the same star cluster today are chemically identical,’ said Dr Mark Krumholz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. ‘But we had no good reason to think that this would also be true of stars that were born together and then dispersed immediately rather than forming a long-lived cluster.’ For example it’s thought that our sun and its siblings probably went their own separate ways within a few million years after they were born. But the study suggests that, even if the long-lost siblings are now the other side of the galaxy, they could be found. To make the findings Dr Krumholz and UC Santa Cruz graduate student Yi Feng used supercomputers to simulate two streams of interstellar gas coming together to form a cloud that, over the course of a few million years, collapses under its own gravity to make a cluster of stars. This face-on view of the simulation shows interstellar giant molecular cloud gas streams mixing before collapsing to form stars. The numbers rapidly increasing at the upper left show the passage of time in millions of years. The left panel shows the density of interstellar gas and right panel shows red and blue 'tracer dyes' The results showed extreme turbulence as the two streams came together, and this turbulence effectively mixed together the tracer dyes. 'We put red dye in one stream and blue dye in the other, and by the time the cloud started to collapse and form stars, everything was purple,' said Dr Krumholz. 'The resulting stars were purple as well. 'This explains why stars that are born together wind up having the same abundances: as the cloud that forms them is assembled, it gets thoroughly mixed. 'This was actually a bit of a surprise. I didn't expect the turbulence to be as violent as it was, so I didn't expect the mixing to be as rapid or efficient. I thought we'd get some blue stars and some red stars, instead of getting all purple stars.' This edge-on view shows a cross section through the two streams as they meet. In both animations the circles outlined in black are stars; stars are shown as white in the left panel, and in the right panel their color reflects the amount of the two tracer dyes in each star . The simulations also showed that the mixing happens very fast, before much of the gas has turned into stars. This is encouraging for the prospects of finding the sun's siblings, because the distinguishing characteristic of stellar families that don't stay together is that they probably disperse before much of their parent cloud has been converted to stars. If the mixing didn't happen quickly enough, then the chemical uniformity of star clusters would be the exception rather than the rule. Instead, the simulations indicate that even clouds that don't turn much of their gas into stars produce stars with nearly identical chemical signatures. 'The idea of finding the siblings of the sun through chemical tagging is not new, but no one had any idea if it would work,"" Dr Krumholz said. 'The underlying problem was that we didn't really know why stars in clusters are chemically homogeneous, and so we couldn't make any sensible predictions about what would happen in the environment where the sun formed, which must have been quite different from the environments that give rise to long-lived star clusters. 'This study puts the idea on much firmer footing and will hopefully spur greater efforts toward making use of this technique.' In the simulation the researchers found that chemicals in interstellar clouds, represented by a purple trace dye (shown), mixed more than thought in the turbulent event. The research could ultimately lead to find brothers and sisters of our sun elsewhere in the Milky Way .","Astrophysicists at the University of California have simulated star formation .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 09:43 EST, 21 July 2011 . Nick Clegg spoke of 'murky practices and dodgy relationships' at the heart of Britain's establishment as he spoke at a conference at Admiralty House in London today . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned David Cameron about having shamed phone hacking suspect Andy Coulson at the heart of government, it emerged today. The Liberal Democrat leader took Cameron to one side when the Coalition was formed in 2010 and questioned why the former News of the World editor was a Downing Street communications director. As pressure on the Prime Minister grew, Mr Clegg added to deepening divisions in government as he attempted to distance himself and his party from the 'murky practices' that have 'rocked' the establishment to its core. Mr Clegg insisted that the decision . to appoint Coulson - who has since been arrested - rested solely with Mr . Cameron, signalling that the Prime Minister should take . responsibility for the furore. 'I asked questions about some of the . decisions about who was being brought into government, who had been . active in opposition,' Mr Clegg said in a conference at Admiralty House . today. Asked . whether he had challenged Mr Coulson's appointment, Mr Clegg said: 'Of . course there were constant conversations - particularly in the early . stages of the Government - about how the Government was going to be . formed, who was going to be appointed, who was going to be employed and . so on. Growing pressure: David Cameron meets a staff member of the Big Issue newspaper as he guest edits this week's paper in South London today . The Coalition number two said that he had raised serious concerns about phone hacking and called for an inquiry even before the last general . election. He added: 'It was (Mr Cameron's) decision and he has been very frank and candid about the fact that he . takes responsibility for it. In the same way that I take responsibility . for appointments in my team, he takes responsibility for appointments to . his team.' The comments came as Prime Minister . David Cameron was under renewed pressure today over his contacts with . senior executives at News Corporation. Aides have now confirmed that Mr Cameron had discussed the company's bid to take over BSkyB with the media players. The attack from his coalition partner will add to the pressure on Cameron and deepen the cracks in government. David Cameron is said to have discussed BSkyB with senior executives of Rupert Murdoch, left, and to have been warned about hiring Andy Coulson, right . Mr Clegg said that there were 'murky practices and dodgy relationships' at the heart of Britain's establishment. He . said the hacking scandal, and allegations that police officers were . paid by the press for information, had 'shaken' faith in the police and . brought public opinion of politicians to an even lower level . The Lib Dem leader sought to establish a . distinctive position for his party, saying: 'I don't think anyone should . be surprised that the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives come at this . issue from completely different directions. 'We were the only party in opposition to call for an inquiry into the phone-hacking allegations, even before the election. Mr Clegg said that the judge-led . inquiry into the hacking allegations provided a once-in-a-generation . opportunity to clean up the media, politics and the police, by . legislation if necessary. Politicians must be ready to accept Lord . Justice Leveson's recommendations and act on them, he said. Liberal . Democrats have not been implicated in the recent furore over . politicians' relations with the press, but Mr Clegg has struggled to . capitalise on this in the polls. Mr Clegg added: 'Going back further than that, we . were the only party to campaign for new pluralism rules in the media. The Liberal Democrats have had a particularly unique role in raising . issues which were ignored by the other parties for years and years, most . notably by the last Labour government. 'I . was the first person in Government to say it had to be a judge-led . inquiry. I was the first person in Government to say that Rupert Murdoch . needed to reconsider his bid. 'I was the first person in Government to say we needed to cover not just the police and press but politicians as well. 'On . each and every one of these counts, I pushed that case and thankfully . we have now got the right kind of inquiry, which I think will go a long, . long way to cleaning up what was a very, very unhealthy state of . affairs. 'I passionately believe in open, . transparent balanced government where people are not in each other's . pockets, and that is what I think we now have an opportunity to achieve . over the next few months and years, and that is an opportunity I hope we . will seize.' Quizzed: James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, earlier this week . Mr Clegg added: 'I think that we now . have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to really clean up the murky . practices and dodgy relationships which have taken root at the very . heart of the British establishment between the press, politicians and . the police. 'That is what . we now need to get on and do. That's what the independent judge-led . inquiry will allow us to do.

"By . Emily Allen . Updated: . 11:30 EST, 5 December 2011 . The wife of a GP who disappeared following years of depression has appealed to other men suffering from the condition to seek help. Eight days after Gary Speed's death Shona Lidgey has told how her husband David walked out of their home in Downham Market, Norfolk, five months ago and has not been seen since. The 45-year-old said her husband, a respected GP, left a note saying he had 'gone for a walk'. Missing: David Lidgey, a respected GP, walked out of his home in Norfolk five months ago and has not been seen since . He had battled depression for several years but Mrs Lidgey, also a doctor, said he felt unable to seek help. She told the Daily Telegraph: 'He was wonderful at treating . his patients who were suffering from depression, but he couldn’t treat . himself, although he tried.' She added: 'There should be more awareness about men suffering from depression.' Wales manager Speed was found hanged in his garage at his Cheshire home on November 27 by his wife Louise. There is no indication Speed was suffering from depression prior to his death. Just hours before the father-of-two had appeared on television laughing and joking. Gary Speed and his wife Louise pictured watching his friend Robbie Savage on Strictly Come Dancing last month. Speed was found hanged eight days ago . Mrs Lidgey said her husband of 18 years had driven their three children to school on June 29 but did not come home. He left his car, wallet and mobile phone. She called the police the following morning. The family say there have been several reported sightings of Mr Lidgey in Leicester, which is the city where he studied medicine, but his whereabouts remains a mystery. He also has links to Weymouth and Portsmouth. Mrs Lidgey said her husband had never settled in Norfolk, where they had lived since 2008. An investigation into his computer showed he had not been in touch with anyone prior to his disappearance. Stephen Fry has battled bipolar disorder over the years . According to the Mental Health Foundation depression is more common in women than men. One in four women will require treatment for depression at some point in their lives compared to one in 10 men. It is thought this is due to both social and biological factors and that fact men may have been under diagnosed because they present their GP with different symptoms. Meanwhile, British men are three times as likely as British women to commit suicide. Suicide also remains the most common cause of death in men under 35. Mental health charity MIND said that men manifest depression in different ways - for instance anger and violence - and are far less likely to admit there is a problem in the first place. Mrs Lidgey said men need to feel like they can talk about their problems and it helped when people in the public eye, like Stephen Fry, raised awareness of the issues. Fry has spoken out about his battle with manic depression and his bipolar disorder over the years. Meanwhile, following Speed's death the PFA is planning to send out a 36-page guidebook on handling depression to all its 4,000 members. The guidebook, which includes case studies by Andy Cole, Neil Lennon, Stan Collymore, Paul Gascoigne and PFA chairman Clarke Carlisle, is also being made available to 50,000 ex-professionals. The PFA has also provided details of hotlines for players who believe they need help, as part of a long-term commitment to curing mental illness.",Wife speaks out about husband's depression eight days after Gary Speed's death .

"By . James Chapman . Updated: . 03:20 EST, 16 November 2011 . Berlin declared last night that Europe is speaking German and Britain must be less selfish toward the EU. The UK has a duty to help the eurozone despite being outside the single currency, according to one of Angela Merkel’s closest allies. Even more provocatively, Volker Kauder warned Britain could not block a financial tax that would cost the City billions. Provocative: Volker Kauder (left) - one of Angela Merkel's closest allies - warned Britain could not block a financial tax that would cost the City billions . He insisted it was wrong for London to defend its own interests, adding: ‘Only going after their own benefit, and refusing to contribute, is not the message we’re letting the British get away with.’ He said European nations were speaking German in that they were backing Chancellor Merkel’s diktats. The comments will cause fury among senior Conservatives, who say Germany’s refusal to prop up the euro threatens to drag the UK economy down as well. ‘British people will be horrified by what is going on in Europe,’ said Philip Hollobone, a Eurosceptic Tory MP. ‘Foreign policy going back to the . time of Henry VIII has been to try to prevent conglomeration of power on . the continent of Europe which would be against British national . interests. ‘Here we are in . the 21st century with a German attempt to create a single economic and . political bloc. This is Britain’s golden chance to get out of the . European quagmire and set ourselves free.’ Controversial: David Cameron with Mrs Merkel. The comments will cause fury among senior Conservatives . No signs of abating: The economic turmoil in the eurozone continues to cause deep concern . Meanwhile, the economic turmoil that has gripped Europe shows no sign of going away. The interest rate Italy has to pay to finance its vast debts topped 7 per cent again yesterday – despite a change that saw a technocratic government replace Silvio Berlusconi’s administration. Such payments are seen as unsustainable and have triggered bailouts in Ireland, Portugal and Greece. Spain was unable to borrow the full £3billion it needed from the money markets yesterday and was charged 5 per cent interest for supposedly risk-free, 12-month loans. Attack: Nick Clegg criticised David Cameron's suggestion that the crisis gave the UK an opportunity to take powers from Brussels . The gap between French and German government bond yields reached record levels – revealing fears about Paris’s exposure to debts elsewhere. But Mr Kauder, parliamentary leader of Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, insisted EU governments were backing Germany’s push for closer integration of their economies in response to the turmoil. He said there was now widespread support for strict limits on debt levels in eurozone economies, with sanctions applied to any that step out of line. ‘Now, all of a sudden, Europe is speaking German,’ declared Mr Kauder. ‘Not as a language, but in its acceptance of the instruments for which Angela Merkel has fought so hard.’ He said Britain must be less self-centred in its relationship with Europe. ‘The British are not members of the currency union but they are members of Europe and they also have a responsibility for the success of Europe,’ he told the annual congress of Mrs Merkel’s CDU in Leipzig. On the proposed City financial transactions tax, he said: ‘The British don’t  want this and I understand, when 30 per cent of your gross domestic product comes from the financial market business in the City of London.’ The row flared as the pro-EU Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg attacked David Cameron’s suggestion that the crisis gave the UK an opportunity to take powers from Brussels. The Prime Minister used his annual foreign policy speech at the Lord Mayor of London’s banquet on Monday night to insist that the crisis in the eurozone provided an opportunity for the EU be refashioned as a looser union.","‘Only going after their [Britain's] own benefit, and refusing to contribute, is not the message we’re letting the British get away with'

"By . David Richards . Updated: . 09:27 EST, 6 December 2011 . Scotland Yard detectives have flown to Spain to investigate whether Madeleine McCann was abducted and smuggled across the border from Portugal before being delivered to a Victoria Beckham lookalike. The officers, who visited Barcelona last month, are believed to be re-examining reports that the well-dressed woman asked businessman at the city's marina if he was there to deliver her 'new daughter' shortly after the youngster's disappearance. The man, who was chaperoning his brother on a stag party, was too shocked to reply and the woman repeated the question twice more. A second member of the party also spoke to the woman before she left. Madeleine and, right, an artist's impression of the Victoria Beckham lookalike. Private detectives hired by the McCanns have always believed that the incident in Barcelona could be significant . Madeleine was nearly four when she . went missing from her family's holiday flat in Praia da Luz in the . Algarve on May 3, 2007 as her parents Kate and Gerry dined with friends . nearby. The incident with the woman happened on May 7. The theory is that the child may have been snatched by a paedophile gang and smuggled into Spain – an hour’s drive away from her family’s holiday flat. Private detectives hired by the McCanns have always believed that the suspicious incident in the Spanish port could be significant. They made a public appeal for information about the woman, said to have an Australian or New Zealand accent and able to speak fluent Spanish, who approached the Britons drinking in a bar at 2am. One man was approached by the woman, who was reportedly between 30 and 35, in the belief that he was someone she was expecting to meet.He described her as appearing ‘agitated’.

The detectives who flew to Barcelona . spent three days with their Spanish colleagues and are among 30 . Metropolitan Police officers carrying out a review of her case. They are . also examining possible sightings of Madeleine after she vanished. There were a number of sightings of . children matching her description in Spain shortly after she . disappeared, and Portuguese authorities were criticised for not alerting . border and police officials until 12 hours after she went missing. In July, Scotland Yard said it would . examine all the evidence connected to the case, including material . gathered by private investigators, after a request by David Cameron. Detectives then spent months reading a huge file of case material that had to be translated from Portuguese to English. Yesterday police played down any . suggestion of a breakthrough in the case, but Madeleine’s parents Kate . and Gerry McCann said they were ‘pleased that the review is making . progress’. A Met police spokesman said: ‘There has been very good co-operation with Portuguese authorities and liaison will continue. ‘Officers have travelled to Portugal . three times in connection with the investigative review, and three . officers travelled to Barcelona. They are continuing to discuss how to . take it forward and we are hopeful that we will be able to do that.’",Incident in Barcelona happened four days after child disappeared from Algarve .
"By . Chris Greenwood . Mystery: The naked and decomposing body of Gareth Williams, 31, was found locked inside a holdall in the bath of his home in Pimlico, central London, in August 2010 . The MI6 spy whose body was found locked in a sports bag may have been killed by a secret agent, his family said yesterday. Their barrister suggested a sinister cover-up had left them with no way of knowing how and why Gareth Williams died. One theory is that he died at the hands of a colleague. Another is that a foreign agent killed him because of his espionage work. The discovery of the body in his flat near the Secret Service headquarters in London sparked a 20-month police inquiry that has drawn a blank. At a public hearing yesterday, it emerged that the flat may have been swept clean of evidence, with no fingerprints or DNA anywhere. It was also revealed that – far from being a back-office worker – Mr Williams had just completed training for deployment on operations. Other revelations included: . The unclothed body of the super-fit maths prodigy was found in a large padlocked North Face bag in the bath of his Government-owned Pimlico flat in August 2010. The codebreaker from Anglesey, North Wales, had links to London's bondage and gay scene and it had already been suggested a sex game, possibly with a colleague, may have had a tragic end. But Westminster Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox was told yesterday his grieving family fear whoever is responsible expertly covered up the evidence. Their barrister Anthony O'Toole rejected the conclusion of an internal MI6 inquiry that Mr Williams's death 'had nothing to do with his work'. Suspicions: Relatives believe a third party was either present when Gareth Williams died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence, lawyer Anthony O'Toole said . Mr Williams, pictured riding his bike, was found dead inside a body bag similar to the one pictured, right . He said: 'There is a high probability . that some third party was in the flat when Gareth was placed in the bag. Evidentially there seems to be no trace of an unknown party in the . flat. 'Our impression is that the unknown third party was a member of some agency specialising in the dark arts or secret services. 'Or perhaps evidence has been removed from the scene post-mortem by experts in those arts.' Mr Williams was nearing the end of a . one-year secondment from the GCHQ listening station to the headquarters . of the Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, in Vauxhall, London. Dr Wilcox was told a wide-ranging and . highly sensitive police inquiry has left many questions unanswered over . the circumstances of his death. Experts believe it would have been . 'difficult, if not impossible' for Mr Williams to lock himself in the . bag but can find no evidence of anyone else being present. His body was found curled in the . foetal position in the 140-litre black and red holdall with the keys to . the Yale travel padlock beneath him. Pathologists found no evidence of . injuries or that he attempted to fight his way out. It remains possible . that his dead body was put inside the bag. Last images: Metropolitan Police released CCTV of his last known movements at Holland Park tube station . Questions: The family want to know why the alarm was not raised when Mr Williams failed to turn up to work and why it took his sister Ceri, pictured left at his funeral, to ring police to make them aware he was missing . Dr Wilcox said that whether Mr . Williams was alive inside the bag and locked it himself 'was at the very . heart of this inquiry'. She may order officials to recreate how he . could have got inside it at the full inquest which is due to take place . next month. Experts have been unable to agree on . exactly how Mr Williams died, favouring asphyxiation or hypercapnia, a . catastrophic build-up of carbon dioxide in the blood. Their work was hampered by the heavily . decayed state of his body and his MI6 colleagues face questions over . why they did not raise the alarm earlier. It also emerged yesterday that . Scotland Yard detectives spent almost 20 months pursuing a DNA trace on . his body that was left by a clumsy forensic scientist. The chief executive of LGC Forensics . will be hauled before the inquest to explain the astonishing blunder . which was discovered only two weeks ago. Red herring: It also emerged that a Mediterranean couple police wanted to speak to were irrelevant to Mr Williams's death . The inquest also heard that a . Mediterranean couple who called at Mr Williams's block had nothing to do . with the case. Detectives released e-fits of the couple and have now . traced them. They were looking for a friend's house. The inquest heard that Mr Williams's . family were unhappy about several aspects of the inquiry, including the . role of counter-terrorism officers who dealt with MI6 and GCHQ staff. They have raised questions about who ordered a second post-mortem . examination and what happened to Mr Williams's possessions held in a . work locker. The family also want to hear more . details about the nature of his work but MI6 representatives said . disclosing the information could endanger national security. Dr Wilcox attacked police for delaying . the handover of evidence and questioned why the names of some witnesses . had been withheld. She said some sensitive letters had gone missing. MI6 has applied for several of Mr Williams's colleagues to give evidence . anonymously and from behind screens.","Gareth Williams's family believe a third party was either present when he died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence .

"By . Jill Reilly . A man spent nearly a year behind bars on charges that he raped a woman - even though a day after she made her accusation, she retracted it. Darrell Dula, 25, who has been in jail since June 28 last year, was freed on Tuesday. His surprise release came after . Brooklyn prosecutors turned over a newly discovered statement that .

Freed: Darrell Dula, 25, spent nearly a year behind bars on charges that he raped a woman - even though a day after she made her accusation, she retracted it .

By Wednesday night, Dula was back . at home in Crown Heights, playing with his three-year-old son for the . first time in a year. He told The New York Times that he was 'overjoyed.'  'I’m relieved that the truth came out,' he added. The ex-prosecutor in the case, has admitted she doubted the accuser's credibility, but the District Attorney's Office pressured her to push forward anyway. Shocking revelations: Brooklyn prosecutors turned over a newly discovered statement that Dula¿s 22-year-old accuser, a Jewish Orthdox woman, made to police in which she says he never raped her . Revealed: The day after the woman made the rape allegation, she told detectives she had been a hooker since she was 13, and had made up the story . The alleged victim made a complaint to . police, accusing Dula of being part of a group who . raped, beat and prostituted her since she was aged 13 - Dula was charged with forcible rape. Strong words: Dula's lawyer, James Phillips, said the retraction is a 'smoking gun that destroys the credibility of this witness' He was one of four men arrested - the other three, Damien Crooks, Jamali Brockett and Jawara Brockett, were charged with sex trafficking by District Attorney Charles Hynes back in June last year. But the day after the woman made the . rape allegation, she told detectives she had been a hooker since she was . 13, and had made up the story. 'When the detective asked her why did . you make up the story? She replied and this is what the detective wrote . in his official report, ‘Can’t a ho change her life?’” said James . Phillips, Dula’s attorney to CBSlocal.com. The woman also signed a recantation, but the case proceeded. But it was only this week that Dula's lawyers learned of the recantation and police interview this week. Prosecutor Rebecca Gingold discovered teh missing documents. She had replaced Assistant District Attorney Abbie Greenberger on the case after she recently left her job. Justice Wayne Ozzi was informed that in reviewing, Gingold noticed the documents were missing. She found them down and immediately turned them over to Dula's lawyer James Phillips. This week Abbie Greenberger has admitted she found inconsistencies in the 22-year-old accuser’s account: . 'When . I brought the inconsistencies to Lauren Hersh (chief of the . sex-trafficking unit at the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office), I was . told that I didn’t do my job right and that I’m trying to dismiss the case and that I should work harder,' Ms Greenberger told the New York Daily News. Accused: Dula  was one of four men arrested - the other three, Damien Crooks, left and Jamali Brockett, right  were charged with sex trafficking - they remain in custody . Greenberger added that she was not aware of the controversial documents. During a hearing on Tuesday in Brooklyn Supreme Court, Dula’s lawyer, James Phillips, said the retraction is a 'smoking gun that destroys the credibility of this . witness,' Phillips said. 'The only witness against my client admitted to . lying.' The other defendants, Damien Crooks, Jamali Brockett and his brother Jawara Brockett, are still in custody. Dula said he is hoping the case against him will dismissed when he returns to court June 11. Strong words: 'The sex trafficking case against the other three defendants is not affected. When we discovered the recantation regarding this rape incident we immediately notified the defense attorneys said  District Attorney Charles Hynes . Although the district attorney’s office said it planned to continue the prosecution of all four defendants, The New York Times reported officials familiar with the case suggested the recent police report revelations will probably lead the authorities to drop all charges against Dula. 'The sex trafficking case against the other three defendants is not affected. When we discovered the recantation regarding this rape incident we immediately notified the defense attorneys,' said  Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes. The DA’s Office declined to comment to the New York Daily News on Greenberger’s version of events.","Darrell Dula, 25, who had been in custody since June 28 last year, was released on Tuesday .

"By . David Gardner . Warning: General Martin Dempsey has said an Israeli strike would come too late to crush Iran's nuclear programme . An Israeli strike would come too late to crush Iran’s nuclear programme, according to America’s top military chief. General Martin Dempsey said such an attack would ‘clearly delay but probably not destroy’ Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Speaking from London, where he was with a U.S. delegation visiting the Paralympic Games, it was the strongest comment yet from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff distancing America from a possible unilateral attack by Israel. Israel is believed to be planning a military strike ahead of November's Presidential elections. Barack Obama would be under pressure to support the attack - even though military chiefs are against it - for fear of alienating Jewish voters in key swing states such as Florida. Emphasizing Washington’s position, General Dempsey - America's most senior general - added: 'I don’t want to be complicit if they (Israel) decide to do it.’ And he said there was a worry that the international coalition putting pressure on Tehran ‘could be undone if Iran was attacked prematurely.’ He insisted that sanctions were having an effect and should be given a reasonable chance of succeeding. His comments came on the same day that the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran had doubled its number of centrifuges and accelerated nuclear fuel production – a clear sign that it is pressing ahead with its nuclear plans. In private, America has repeatedly warned Israel that it does not have the military capability to destroy Iran’s main underground, heavily fortified nuclear site. While the U.S. does have the firepower, it wants to give sanctions more time to work. On Syria, General Dempsey dismissed the feasibility of a humanitarian buffer zone within the country, saying there was no comparison with the uprising in Libya. Concerned: Israel's Vice Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon, right, said he feared Iran did not believe it faced a real military threat from the West. The Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is pictured left . Any countries enforcing a no-fly zone in the area would also have the responsibility of providing protection against Syrian missiles, he said. Like Britain, the U.S. was providing ‘non-lethal’ aid to Syrian rebels, but he said he was concerned that a failed state would only add to growing fears in the West that the civil war was attracting al Qaeda and extreme jihadists. In Israel yesterday, Vice Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon said he feared Iran did not believe it faced a real military threat from the West because of mixed messages from the US and other foreign powers. 'We have an exchange of views, including with our friends in the United States, who in our opinion, are in part responsible for this feeling in Iran. 'There are many cracks in the ring closing tighter on Iran. We criticise this,' he said.","General Martin Dempsey said an attack would ‘clearly delay but probably not destroy’ its nuclear programme .

"By . Phil Vinter . She provides a welcome distraction for millions, but best-selling author Zadie Smith says to write her new book she had to block out addictive websites that lead her astray. Smith, who wrote the critically-acclaimed White Teeth in 1997, says she struggled to maintain her concentration while writing her new book NW on the computer because of the diversions available just a click on the internet. In the acknowledgements section of her latest novel, Smith credits two internet applications - one called Freedom© and a second called Self Control© - for 'creating the time' in which to write. Writers blocks: Author Zadie Smith, right, has admitted she used applications which block internet sites so she didn't get distracted when writing her new novel NW, left . The apps restrict internet use or block access to specific websites, leaving writers like Smith to concentrate on putting finger to keyboard to fill the blank pages in front of them. Other authors such as Fever Pitch writer Nick Hornby have also confessed to turning to the big brother style blocking tool to make up for their own lack of self-control. However, others such as Will Self whose new novel Umbrella is on the Man Booker prize list, have mocked the use of the apps. NW is Zadie Smith's fourth novel and . is set in North-West London where the author grew up. It features Leah and Natalie, who are now . in their thirties after growing up together on a local council estate. Zadie Smith was born as Sadie Smith . in the London borough of Brent . to a Jamaican mother, Yvonne Bailey, and a British father, Harvey . Smith. As a child she was fond of tap . dancing; as a teenager she considered a career as an actress in musical . theatre; and as a university student she earned money as a jazz singer . and wanted to become a journalist. White Teeth was her first novel and was introduced to the publishing world in 1997. 'Turn off the computer. Write by hand,' he was quoted as saying in The Telegraph. Smith writes the first drafts of his own works on a typewriter to escape the temptations of the internet. He added: The internet is of not relevance at all to the business of writing fiction directly.' Fellow Booker prize nominee Ned Beauman is another who has admitted to turning to technology to keep the internet at arm's length. The Teleportation Accident author said he blocked almost all newspapers and magazine websites as well as blogs and Twitter. For those addicted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter the appropriately named AntiSocial app will prevent such access. Others on the market include K9 and . Chrome Nanny which enable users to restrict access to certain sites at . particular times of the day. The inventor of both Freedom and . Anti-Social is Fred Stutzman who wanted to restrict his own access to . enable him to write his PhD dissertation. Author Jonathan Franzen has taken the idea of shutting out all other distractions to the extreme. He . claimed he touch-typed parts of his 2001 novel The Corrections by not . just switching off the internet, but also wearing earmuffs and a . blindfold.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Andrew Levy . A 'callous' police constable who repeatedly punched his pregnant ex-girlfriend to try to trigger a miscarriage was jailed for ten years yesterday. Matthew Cherry, 35, used a balaclava and a fake foreign accent to launch the 'savage attack' at Caroline Craft's ground-floor flat in Bournemouth, Dorset. He punched her in the stomach and back, targeting her unborn child and leaving her 'bloodied and bruised' after the attack. Remarkably, Miss Craft was not seriously harmed and gave birth to a boy - now 15 months old. Matthew Cherry (left), 35, used a balaclava and a fake foreign accent to launch the 'savage attack' at Caroline Craft's (right) ground-floor flat in Bournemouth, Dorset . Cherry was angry and upset that Miss Craft, 27, also a police officer, would not have an abortion and the pair split up, Winchester Crown Court heard during the eight-day trial. Cherry, of Southampton, denied attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent in March last year in the 'well-planned' attack. But the jury convicted him, rejecting his claim that he was not the attacker and was several miles away renovating a house. Miss Craft was six months pregnant when she answered the door to a masked attacker on March 24, thinking it was an estate agent who had come to view her flat. Matthew Jewell, prosecuting, said: 'Caroline Craft then heard a knock on the door of her flat. She opened the door, which was then pushed violently from outside, and she was either pushed or punched to the floor. 'She was then attacked with multiple punches to her stomach and back, in a way which targeted her unborn child. She shouted for help and a gloved hand was placed over her mouth. She was also kicked. 'She pointed out valuable items in case this was a robbery or burglary but her attacker showed no interest in taking anything. Jailed: Cherry, pictured arriving at court this week, carried out the 'evil' attack on his ex-girlfriend in March to make her miscarry . 'She was dragged into the bathroom and forced to sit on the toilet. 'The male said he would tie her up. She was absolutely terrified about what was happening to her in her own home.' The attack only ended because the estate agent turned up and Cherry fled, using a back door as he knew the block well and had owned the flat before selling it to Miss Craft. Sentencing Cherry, The Recorder of Winchester, Judge Keith Cutler, told him: 'It was a pernicious and evil attack. On your part there was a high degree of planning. 'It was clear that you used your . skills and training as a police officer to ensure your phone was left to . give yourself an alibi and you masked your appearance.' Cherry . looked likely to faint in the dock and he kept saying: 'I didn't do it' as the judge told him he made one mistake of not disposing of the Nike . trainer box even though he destroyed all his other clothes - a factor . the judge believed that had led the jury to find him guilty. He shook his head after being unanimously convicted by a jury following more than seven hours' deliberation. He . told Cherry he had now lost his career, his future and his liberty by . his 'appalling' actions that had thankfully not led to serious harm to . Miss Craft or the baby. A jury at Winchester Crown Court (pictured) convicted Cherry unanimously, rejecting his claim that he was nowhere near his former partner when she was attacked . 'It was only through good fortune, and not anything to do with you, that Caroline Craft only suffered physical injuries she has recovered from. In a statement released after the verdict, Miss Craft told how she has been affected by the attack. She said: 'The past 18 months have been a living hell. The actions of Matthew Cherry on that day were callous, cold-hearted and utterly selfish. 'I will never forgive him for what he did to me and what he so nearly could have done to my baby. 'I thank God that despite Matthew Cherry's efforts, my beautiful son, Archie, was born healthy and unharmed by his actions. 'This verdict has given me some closure and I can now hopefully start to move on with my life and build a future for me and my son.' Senior investigating officer Detective Inspector Stewart Balmer, from Dorset Police, said after the case: 'This was a dreadful and calculated attack on a pregnant woman, made all the more chilling because Cherry was a police officer at the time he planned and carried out this shocking assault. 'Not accepting Caroline's decision to have the baby, Cherry tried to take matters into his own hands and carefully planned the attack - using his policing knowledge in an attempt to throw detectives off his trail. 'It was inevitable that he would make mistakes, however, and it is a testament to the hard work of the investigation team, and the bravery of Caroline and the witnesses, that his dishonest and wicked behaviour was exposed to the jury.' 'Every day when she looks at her healthy young son, she will be reminded of his father.' Cherry was linked to the crime by a jigsaw puzzle of evidence that presented a 'compelling picture' that he was the attacker who carried out the 'savage attack' and the jury of five women and seven men agreed. He had told Miss Craft and her flatmate Carla Hutchings that he had thought about punching her in the stomach to cause a miscarriage. He said the pregnancy had left him feeling 'trapped' and had 'ruined his life', the jury heard. And he even discussed with a police colleague how to bring on a miscarriage. He told the jury that he did not love Miss Craft and was only fond of her. Miss Hutchings was away in New York when Miss Craft was attacked. She had posted the trip on Facebook and Cherry had access to her page. Footwear impressions were found at the scene and were found to have been left by size 10 Nike Dart trainers. Cherry took a size 10 shoe and when his home was searched, a Nike box was found that had originally held size 10 Nike Dart trainers. He admitted he used to have the same trainers and had thrown them away several years previously but the prosecution said he had made a mistake. CCTV found a hooded man reconnoitring the route to the flat an hour before the attack and Cherry's mobile phone was tracked to the same area at the same time. It was the route the hooded attacker took when he fled, which was also caught on CCTV. Analysis found that the man on the CCTV was 6ft 1in tall and Cherry is 6ft 1in tall. Police also found out the vacuum cleaner the attacker carried was a Panasonic model and one of similar appearance was given to the defendant's brother and kept in a communal area but disappeared after the attack. Cherry, who resigned from Dorset Police in November last year, was 'forensically aware' and had used his police experience to try to avoid detection, the court heard.","Matthew Cherry attacked ex Caroline Craft in March last year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Criticised: Trendy American clothing giant American Apparel has been criticised by the advertising watchdog for an advert which 'appeared to sexualise a child' - a week after falling foul of the same issue . Trendy American clothing giant American Apparel has been criticised by the advertising watchdog for an advert which 'appeared to sexualise a child' - a week after falling foul of the same issue. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld two complaints about . the advert, which appeared on the back cover of Vice Magazine. It pictured a girl sitting on an office chair wearing a jumper, knickers . and knee-length socks. She was posed with her legs up on the chair and . her knickers were visible. The latest ruling comes a week after the clothing brand fell foul of the . ASA with campaigns featuring 'gratuitous' images and the sexualisation . of models who appeared to be under 16. American Apparel ran into similar . issues with campaigns in 2009 and earlier this year. The people who complained about the advert on the back of Vice Magazine objected that it was offensive and irresponsible. American Apparel denied that, saying the model featured was over 18 and . was wearing products that were meant for adult consumers. They said they . placed the ad in Vice Magazine, a publication written for adults, and . the model wore clothes which were available for sale in their stores and . online, in this case underwear and a sweater. Vice Magazine also did not believe the advert was offensive or . irresponsible. They said it featured a woman wearing socks, underwear . and a top and there was nothing to suggest anything overtly sexual or . inappropriate was being portrayed. They also pointed out it contained no . nudity. American Apparel has since confirmed to them that the model was . over 18. Problems: American Apparel ran into similar issues with campaigns in 2009 and earlier this year . The ASA said the model pictured appeared to be young and potentially under the age of 16. It said: 'Whilst we acknowledged the image did not contain any explicit . nudity, we considered that the amateur style of the photo, the posing of . the model with her legs up on an office style chair with her knickers . showing and the unsmiling expression on the model’s face meant the photo . would be interpreted as having sexual undertones and a voyeuristic . quality. 'We concluded the ad inappropriately sexualised a model who appeared to be a child and was therefore irresponsible. 'We had not seen demographic data for Vice Magazine but understood it . was intended for an adult audience. However, we concluded that because . it appeared to sexualise a child the ad was likely to cause serious or . widespread offence in a magazine that was untargeted and freely . available. Removed: This image on the American Apparel website was ruled offensive by the ASA . Banned: Bosses at American Apparel were previously ordered to ditch this image used on its website after the Advertising Standards Authority ruled it was offensive . 'The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told American . Apparel not to depict any model as inappropriately sexualised who could, . through their appearance or styling, appear to be a child.' A spokesman for American Apparel said: 'It’s unfortunate that the ASA . has made this ruling as our models are clearly of age and were featured . in Vice Magazine, a publication clearly intended for mature, fashion . forward audiences. 'Obviously we’ll abide by this ruling as we have in the past with . similar ASA decisions, but American Apparel will not be altering our . classic advertising aesthetic which is internationally recognised for . its artistic and social values.'","The Advertising Standards Authority upheld two complaints about .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . All but two casinos in Atlantic City are back in business after a near five-day shutdown for Superstorm Sandy and despite much of the city remaining without power. Governor Chris Christie announced at 10am Friday that he was rescinding an order that had closed the casinos in preparation for Sandy, while also lifting the mandatory evacuation order for Atlantic City residents. The Golden Nugget moved quickly to start recouping its losses, opening 90 minutes after the governor's order. Nine others prepared to open later in the day as the struggling gambling industry scrambled to restart after a second forced shutdown in two years. Queues forming: The Golden Nugget was open an hour and a half after the casino closure was lifted . Atlantic City was in the direct line of Sandy's path and suffered mass devastation from the rising sea swell and rapid winds . Golden Nugget general manager Tom . Pohlman has described business as ‘surprisingly strong’ and said there . were lines prior to opening for the slot machines and the buffet. Collectively, Atlantic City’s 12 casinos are estimated to have lost about $5million each day in gambling revenue. The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, . the Tropicana Casino and Resort and the two Trump casinos planned to . open late this afternoon. Of the remaining two casinos, Revel plans to open at noon Saturday and the Atlantic Club on Monday. Among the first customers at Golden . Nugget was 63-year-old Joyce Dean, who lives in Atlantic City. ‘I was . cooped up with my sister,’ she said. ‘I'm so happy to get out and resume . my daily visit to Golden Nugget.’ The Golden Nugget Atlantic City, shown here in January, has been reopened . Pohlman said he understands that some . gamblers are more focused on recovery than diversions. But he said . reopening will help employees. 'We employ a large majority of the . people that live in Atlantic City and surrounding barrier islands,’ he . said. ‘Unfortunately, our people don't get paid if they don't work.’ The Division of Gaming Enforcement . has assigned investigators and personnel to each casino to ensure . compliance with safety procedures. ‘The Director has indicated that a . complete review and assessment of the status and condition of each . casino property, including the casino floors, its equipment, . surveillance, security and gaming related computer systems have been . completed,’ said Governor Christie. On Thursday, Christie had said that . although Atlantic City's 12 casinos all had electricity, they wouldn’t . be allowed to reopen until drinking water in the city was found to be . safe and power restored to the rest of the city. The casinos are scrambling to arrange to bring employees into the city that has been shut down since Sunday. Casino Pier earlier this week, pictured in the wake of Hurricane Sandy . Resorts Hotel and Casino, Atlantic City's first casino, which opened Memorial Day 1978. It was only the fourth shutdown in the 34 years that New Jersey has had casinos. Atlantic City was in the direct line of Sandy’s path and suffered mass devastation from the rising sea swell and rapid winds. Now it's reopening, traffic congestion could be a major problem. The storm made landfall with hurricane force winds just a few miles from Atlantic City on Monday. The city was flooded and an old . section of its famous boardwalk - the nation's first - was wrecked in . the storm, though other parts of New Jersey's coast were hit even . harder. Willie Glass, the city's public safety director, said: 'The city's basically flooded. Most of the city is under water.' It was only the fourth shutdown in the 34 years that New Jersey has had casinos. Last year, casinos were closed when . Tropical Storm Irene hit the coast. That three-day shutdown, which came . on a busy summer weekend, cost the city $45million in lost business. The only other closures were for Hurricane Gloria in 1985 and a state government shutdown in 2006. The casinos have been on a losing . streak over the last several years during a sour economy and because of . increased competition from neighboring states.","It is only the fourth shutdown in the 34 years that New Jersey has had casinos .

"By . Paul Milligan . Children across the UK are increasingly being targeted by mobile phone thieves, new figures have revealed. London is the worst affected area, where 10,000 phones are stolen every month, with two thirds of victims aged between 13 and 16. The rise in popularity of high value smartphones, which thieves can easily resell for cash, is a major contributory factor in these shocking figures. The rise of young children using smartphones such as the iPhone, has led to a rise in mobile phone thefts as robbers can resell the expensive devices easily . More than 170 iPhones are stolen every day in London, but as the figures, obtained from the Freedom of Information Act by The Times, show it is a problem affecting the whole country. In Nottinghamshire more than 40 per cent of mobile phone thefts were from people under 21, and in Cheshire the figure is 35 per cent. In Hertfordshire 32 per cent of the victims of mobile phone theft were under 20, and the figure for the same age group in Cumbria is 28 per cent. The figures also show that children as young as six have been victims of this crime. Hertfordshire . Police reported one case where a three-year-old was the victim, the old . mobile phone had been given to the child as a toy. One area of advice to parents wanting their children to have a mobile phone is to give your child a model that is slightly older or less desirable to thieves . Police have been stationed outside some . schools to help reduce the number of thefts, with other schools even . taking the precaution of providing self-defence classes to keep their . pupils safe in the event of a robbery. In Humberside mobile phone theft affecting 10 to 15-year-olds increased 40 per cent last year and in Kent thefts from 16 to 20-year-olds have risen by 30 per cent in the last three years. Keith Hayward, Professor of Criminology at the University of Kent told the Times: 'No one below the age of 10 carried phones around 10 years ago. Now it's a common occurrence. 'Parents give their children a mobile phone because they feel it will make them safe, but ironically it can lead to increasingly victimisation. 'Criminals only steal items that are desirable and that they can sell, and kids are easy targets. perhaps it would be best to give them a phone that is not the top of the range.' The police are struggling to get to grips with the problem because of the sheer number of cases they are faced with. In many instances the crime isn't even reported to the police by victims. Between 2009 and 2011, Hertfordshire Police had 11,027 cases of mobile phone theft. In only five cases were charges brought, and figures also revealed only 77 offenders were cautioned for the offence in that period. In the same time period Thames Valley Police had 34,439 cases of mobile phone theft reported to them. Again, only five per cent of cases saw a charges being brought.","10,000 phones are stolen in London every month, two-thirds are aged 13-16 .

"By . Toby Harnden In Boca Raton, Florida . Mitt Romney will attack President Barack Obama for his 'naive' intention to meet President Ahmadinejad of Iran and warn Americans that the President will hold talks with U.S. adversaries if he is re-elected, according to a senior Romney aide. In July 2007, Obama answered a debate question about whether he would meet 'without precondition' in the first year of his administration 'the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea'. Obama responded: 'I would.' He did not renounce this during the rest of the 2008 campaign. No such talks have ever happened but a weekend report in the 'New York Times' - denied by the White House - that the U.S. has held secret talks with Iran as a prelude to formal negotiations after the election makes Obama freshly vulnerable on the topic, the Romney campaign believes. Scroll down to watch the ad . On the attack: The ad attempts to laud Obama's military achievements during the last four years . Warmonger? Obama claims that Romney would have left American troops in Iraq - but fails to mention the President himself tried to keep 10,000 there . At the time, Hillary Clinton, now Obama's Secretary of State, described Obama's response as 'irresponsible and frankly naive' and that such meetings could be used 'for propaganda purposes'. Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee in 2008, said that it betrayed 'the depth of Senator Obama's inexperience and reckless judgement'. The senior aide said that Romney plans to use the third and final televised debate, in Boca Raton, Florida, to highlight Obama's willingness to meet the world's worst dictators and the dangers of handing a 'blank check' to Obama in the form of a second term. Romney has been more adamant than Obama on the need to stop Iran getting a nuclear weapon 'capability' as opposed to actual nuclear weapons - something Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has also emphasised. Buzzfeed has noted that the Romney campaign recently toughened the Iran language on its website and added a new section slamming Obama 'for his willingness to talk without preconditions or pressure'.The White House has said it was prepared to meet Iran for one-on-one talks but denied the report that post-election negotiations had already been agreed. Meanwhile, the Obama campaign today released an attack ad painting Romney as a warmonger just hours before the pair clash on foreign policy in the debate. Obama previewed his attacks on Romney at their clash in Boca Raton, Florida with an ad that portrays him as an anti-war figure, massaging the facts about his movement of troops in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan. The big stage: Lynn University students serve as stand-ins during final preparations for the debate . Practice run: Stand-ins for US President Obama, right, and Romney, left, and moderator Bob Scheiffer, center, participate in a rehearsal a day ahead of the final presidential debate at Lynn University . Ready for action: President Barack Obama boards Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base today on his way to Boca Raton . 'A decade of war that cost us dearly. And now for president, a clear choice: President Obama ended the Iraq War,' the ad says. 'Mitt Romney would have left 30,000 troops there and called bringing them home 'tragic'. Obama's brought 30,000 soldiers back from Afghanistan and has a responsible plan to end the war. Romney calls it Obama's biggest mistake. It's time to stop fighting over there and start rebuilding here' In fact, Obama tried to negotiate with the Iraq government for 10,000 troops to stay in the country. It was only because talks collapsed that all troops were withdrawn - under an agreement brokered by President George W. Bush. Obama has brought back 30,000 troops from Afghanistan but these were the 30,000 'surge' troops he ordered there in December 2009. Current troops levels are about 68,000 - more than twice when Obama entered the White House. Romney currently leads by a wafer-thin 0.3 per cent nationally in the RealClearPolitics poll of averages. Obama is down seven in the Gallup tracking poll, down two in the Rasmussen poll and has seen his leads in Florida and Virginia disappear and his Ohio advantage whittled down to almost nothing.The latest NBC/WSJ poll, which had Obama three points ahead before the debates, now puts the two candidates dead level on 47 points each among likely voters with six per cent undecided. Celebration: Students at Lynn University held a pool party before the debate to mark the historic occasion . Stunt double: Lynn University student Eric Gooden, a stand-in for President Obama, walks off stage during final preparations for Monday's presidential debate . Although most pundits and post-debate polls have Obama the advantage over Romney following the second debate, he has seen no improvement in the polls and the momentum appears to remain with the Republican nominee. The final presidential debate will focus on foreign policy - a traditional Republican strength that should be an advantage for Obama this time around because of the demise of Osama bin laden last May and the end of the Iraq war. Indeed, Obama has served notice that he will play the bin Laden card to full advantage, saying in his speech at the Al Smith dinner in New York last week: 'Spoiler alert: We got bin Laden.' At the vice-presidential debate in Danville, Kentucky, it took Vice President Joe Biden one minute and seven seconds into the first answer of the debate - to a question about Libya - to bring up bin Laden. Libya, however, presents Obama with some problems. Although Romney got tangled up in the weeds of whether Obama had referred to the Benghazi attack as a 'terrorist act,' during their last bout, the death of the first U.S. ambassador to be murdered in the line of duty since 1979 and the intelligence and security failures that led to it make the president very vulnerable. In addition, it has become clear that . the White House’s initial insistence that the attack was a result of . protests about an anti-Islam video made in California were flat wrong - . and possibly part of an official cover-up.

Despite his mistakes, and a disastrous visit to Britain in August when he managed to offend people by criticising the UK Olympics effort and was mocked by Prime Minister David Cameron and Mayor of London Boris Johnson, Romney has become much more fluent in foreign policy matters. Before the two candidates first . debated on October 3rd, Obama held a 15-point lead over Romney on the . question of who was more capable of dealing with foreign affairs. After Obama’s lackluster performance, a Pew Research Center poll found that the gap had closed to just four points. On the eve of their final . presidential debate, Romney and Obama - through their allies - squared . off Sunday over which candidate would best protect the nation's . interests and security abroad with just two weeks left in a race that . polls show is increasingly tight.

Both candidates stayed largely out of view, preparing vigorously for their face-off focused on foreign policy. Republicans accused Obama of leaking word of possible negotiations with Iran in pursuit of political gain. Democrats shot back, arguing that Romney and his party are the ones playing politics with national security. The haggling played out on Sunday . news shows at a critical time for Romney and Obama, whose marathon race . has become exceedingly close as it lurches toward its November . conclusion. Early and absentee voting are already . under way in many of the most competitive states, upping the pressure . on both candidates to lock in supporters. Romney paused his preparations to . attend church with his wife Sunday morning and to watch his traveling . press corps play touch football against his senior staff.

The former Massachusetts governor presided over a coin toss on the beach, then gathered his aides to cheer them on. 'That's right, don't worry about injuries guys, this counts. Win,' he joked. Romney didn't talk politics, refusing to answer a question about whether, if elected, he would be open to direct talks with Iran. Questions from reporters about the new poll and Monday's debate likewise went unanswered. Obama arrived Friday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, where he's been holding 12-hour practice sessions, starting with policy discussions at 10am. Obama and his team hold mock debates in the evening in a set designed to look like the one in Boca Raton.

"By . Tamara Cohen . Gay clergy in civil partnerships can become bishops, following an apparent U-turn from the Church of England. Despite rejecting proposals to allow women to become bishops, a new ruling means homosexual men can be appointed as long as they remain chaste and repent for any past sexual acts. The Right Reverend Graham James, Bishop of Norwich, released a statement on behalf of the Church yesterday, saying it would be ‘unjust’ to exclude them if they were ‘living in accordance with the teaching of the Church on human sexuality’. Facing challenging times: The incoming Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby may find the announcement on gay bishops - which has divided the church for years - the first test of his tenure . However the decision was attacked from all sides, with conservative Anglicans determined to resist it while those campaigning for the church to recognise gay rights were unconvinced it would work. The issue has split the established Church since 2003 when gay cleric Jeffrey John was made Bishop of Reading, but forced to step down after protests. Now in a chaste civil partnership and serving as Dean of St Albans, he would be allowed to apply for another post. Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, 62, pictured centre, embraces Dean of Canterbury Cathedral Rev Dr Robert Willis following his final Sung Eucharist service at Canterbury Cathedral on December 30th . Dividing issue: The current Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams pushed for the move to be approved in March 2012 - but it was rejected . Clergy have been allowed to enter chaste civil partnerships since 2005. Bishops were not technically banned, but the issue of civil partnerships was shelved until 18 months ago when Church officials began considering it. Religious commentators say the House of Bishops, which is responsible for doctrine, may have been nervous about rejecting openly gay bishops on legal grounds.Yesterday’s statement said: ‘The House has confirmed that clergy in civil partnerships, and living in accordance with the teaching of the Church on human sexuality, can be considered as candidates for the episcopate. ’Conservatives said it would undermine the Church’s opposition to gay marriage, for which it has been granted an exemption from government legislation. Prebendary Rod Thomas of the group Reform warned that it would be even more divisive than women bishops. He told the BBC: ‘If you thought that was a furore, wait to see what . happens the first time a bishop in a civil partnership is appointed.’ The Rev Colin Coward, director of Changing Attitude, which campaigns for . the church to fully accept people of any sexual orientation, said he . welcomed the House of Bishops’ decision. But he added: ‘I don’t believe they are serious about opening the door to someone in a civil partnership becoming a bishop. ‘I would only believe they are serious when it happens.’ Dean of St Albans Dr Jeffrey John, pictured at St Albans Cathedral in 2004, is the most senior openly gay member of the Church of England clergy .","The House of Bishops agreed on the new rule shortly before Christmas .

"By . Alex Gore . A drug addict lesbian couple left a retired bus conductor to slowly die after torturing him for his PIN number, a court heard. Kelly Louise Barnes, 32, and Jodie Barnes, formerly Ramsbottom, 31, are accused of targeting Barry Reeve, 67, at his home in Norwich, believing he had a secret stash of money. They beat him and cut him with a knife before leaving him dying and prosecutors allege they turned the volume on Mr Reeve’s television up in an attempt to mask his screams. In the dock: Kelly Barnes, left, and Jodie Barnes, right, are accused of targeting Barry Reeve, 67, at his home in Norwich, believing he had a secret stash of money . Tortured: A court heard Barry Reeve, 67, was beaten, cut and left to slowly die at his house in Norwich . Mr Reeve, known as Titch because of his small stature, is thought to have remained alive until at least the following morning. The attackers returned to his terraced house in the city’s Corton Road later that evening and striped it of anything of value, including food from the freezer. Prosecutor Karim Khalil QC told the jury Mr Reeve’s body was discovered two weeks after the attack on February 9 last year when his daughter called at the blood-spattered property. Describing the alleged attack, Mr Khalil said: 'He was brutally beaten, cut with a sharp blade and left to die in his home, unable to summon help. 'It is a sad fact that he was not found until two weeks later when his daughter, Julie Reeve, called round. Targeted at home: Corton Road in Norwich where retired bus conductor Mr Reeve, known as Titch, lived . Accused: It is alleged that Kelly Barnes, right, and Jodie Barnes, left, beat Mr Reeve  and cut him with a knife before leaving him dying . 'She found the back door unlocked, opened it and saw blood on the inner door. She could not bear to go in any further and called on a neighbour. 'Together they went back, called for him but got no answer and decided to call the emergency services.' Kelly Louise Barnes and Jodie Barnes, both of Bixley Close, Norwich, who were in a civil partnership together, deny murder. A post-mortem examination showed that Mr Reeve was alive for between 15 and 48 hours after suffering brain injuries. Mr Khalil said the couple had injured him in 'varied and awful ways’. He said: 'His injuries reveal that whilst he was still alive he was beaten savagely and that he was scored with a sharp blade to his face and torso in a manner akin to torture. He must have suffered dreadfully. On trial: Kelly Louise Barnes and Jodie Barnes have denied murdering Mr Reeve at Norwich Crown Court . 'Both of these defendants went to his home uninvited. He was alive when they arrived and was left dying when they departed. 'They were so callous that they later returned to his home in a taxi and cleared out what items they wanted, including foodstuffs from his freezer.’ Mr Reeve lived off a pension and benefits but was heard talking about having large sums of money, once claiming that he carried around £2,000 in cash, the court heard. The trial is expected to last up to three weeks. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Jury hears Jodie and Kelly Louise Barnes beat Barry Reeve at his home .

"By . James  Nye . A long-lost relative of the reclusive and eccentric New York heiress Huguette Clark, who stood to inherit $19 million of her $300 million fortune has been found dead from hypothermia in rural Wyoming. Wealthy: Huguette Clark left an estate valued at $306.5million when she died last year . Timothy Henry Gray's body was discovered by children sledding under a Union Pacific Railroad overpass in Evanston, in the southwest of the state on Thursday, as the temperatures hit 10 degrees. Gray, 60, was the half great-nephew of Clark, who died in May 2011 aged 104 and tragically was unaware that he was potentially entitled to 6.25 percent of her copper mining fortune, which has been conservatively estimated at £307 million by the administrator of her estate. Lieutenant Bull Jeffers of the . Evanston Police Department said that there was no evidence of foul play . involved in the death and that Gray was wearing a light jacket. He . added that it wasn't clear if Gray was living under the overpass at the . time of his death, however, other homeless people have been known to . camp there during the year. Tim . Gray was an adopted great-grandson of former U.S. Senator William . Andrews Clark, who made his reputation as one of the copper kings of .

Because they did not receive a penny in her will, 19 of Clark's relatives stepped forward to challenge her will in a New York court. A public administrator joined in on behalf of Gray who lawyers had tried to contact about the battle, but all they could find were belongings abandoned in a storage locker - private investigators were not able to find him. Indeed, even if investigators could not contact Gray and he had been granted a share of the massive inheritance, his spouse or children would have been entitled to it - however he had no wife or kids. In fact, in spite of his homelessness, Gray had access to money and the coroner said that Gray's wallet contained a cashier's check from 2003, for a 'significant amount.' Gray's older brother, Jerry, said that Tim had worked as a cowboy and lived in the Rocky Mountain states most of his life. 'He was homeless essentially,' said Jerry to NBC News.

Inheritance: Clark, pictured with her father and sister, inherited her vast wealth from industrialist and senator William Clark . Clark's huge fortune, which came to light in court documents at the end of the year show that she had an $84.5 million estate which she had not visited in more than five years. The reclusive millionaire abandoned all five of her homes during her last 20 years, instead setting up residence in a New York hospital. Her valuable estate is at the centre of a bitter legal battle, as her relatives fight to overturn her will which largely divided her fortune between various charities and the nurse who tended her before her death. Documents filed this week in the Manhattan Surrogate's Court reveal exactly how much is at stake - a fortune valued at $306.5million in all, according to NBC News. This vast haul is divided between property, investments and her personal possessions including paintings and a huge collection of dolls. The most valuable item in Ms Clark's estate is 'Bellosguardo', an $84.5million mansion overlooking the ocean in Santa Barbara, California which she had not visited since the 1950s.

More pricey real estate comes in the form of three apartments on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, overlooking Central Park, with a total of 42 rooms between them. The apartments are valued at a total of $53million - the penthouse suite has already been sold for $24million. Ms Clark's country house in New Canaan, Connecticut, known as 'Le Beau Chateau', is apparently worth $14.3million. The home, which she never lived in, has nine bedrooms, a wine cellar, a ballroom and 11 fireplaces. In addition to the five pieces of blockbuster real estate, Ms Clark apparently owned $79.3million in stocks, trusts and cash. She also had $75.4million worth of 'personal property' which includes a painting by Monet and a doll collection which is itself worth millions of dollars.

Legal wrangle: Ms Clark has not visited the 21,666 square feet estate in half a century. She abandoned all of her five homes in later life, instead setting up residence in a New York hospital . The valuation, which will be subject to taxes, came as part of the current court case between Ms Clark's longtime nurse, Hadassah Peri, and her great-nieces and great-nephews. The heiress, whose fortune dervies from her 'robber baron' father, Montana senator W.A. Clark, drew up two separate wills in 2005, aged 98. The first gave $5million to Ms Peri, but left the bulk of the estate to 'intestate distributees', meaning her closest living relatives. But the latest, written just six weeks later, deliberately excluded Ms Clark's family and left most of the fortune to an art foundation to be set up at Bellosguardo. It also included a bequest of around $30million to Ms Peri, a 62-year-old Filipina who earned $131,000 as the millionaire's private caretaker. In a statement released after Ms Clark's death, the nurse said: 'I was her private duty nurse but also her close friend.

"By . Sara Malm . A Swedish artist has caused outrage after exhibiting artwork which he claims to have painted using ashes gathered in the crematorium of a Nazi concentration camp. Carl Michael von Hausswolff stole the ashes from Majdanek concentration camp in Poland during a 1989 trip and over two decades later, mixed it with water and used it as paint. He has now been reported to the police for desecrating the remains of Majdanek’s Holocaust victims, under Swedish burial protection laws. Outrage: Carl Michael von Hausswolff has painted a picture using ashes which he claims to have taken from the crematorium of a Nazi concentration camp in Poland . Mr von Hausswolff visited Poland in 1989 to exhibit his art at a gallery not far from Lublin, a town near Majdanek. He says he was ‘gathering material for the exhibition’ when he visited the concentration camp. ‘I gathered some ashes from one of the cremation ovens, but did not use it for the exhibition – the material was too charged with the cruelties which had taken place.’ Not until 2010 did the artist decide to ‘do something’ with the ashes he had stolen from Majdanek and used it as paint by mixing it with water. The exhibited result has enraged art critics and provoked public outcry over the use of human remains as art. Author and translator Salomon Schulman called the artwork ‘nauseating, obsessed necrophilia’. Morbid art: Mr von Hausswolff took the ashes of victims from the Majdanek concentration camp near Lublin in Poland . With what he calls ‘posthumous disgust’, Mr Schulman asks: ‘Some of the ashes may be from one of my relatives? Maybe even a brother of my flesh?’ ‘It is repulsive beyond the extreme’, he told Swedish television. Local police received a complaint from a member of the public who said the painting breaks the Swedish law protecting buried human remains. ‘It is a strange complaint which we will investigate,’ detective Stephan Söderholm said. Majdanek was a concentration and extermination camp in Lublin, south-west Poland. It was originally built by the Nazis in 1941 as a forced labour camp for up to 50,000 prisoners, a number which was extended to 250,000 before its completion. According to the Majdanek museum, the gas chambers began operation in September 1942. An estimated 79,000 people died at Majdanek, 59,000 of which were Jews. Due to the speed of the Red Army, the Nazi’s did not have time to destroy the camps and it was nearly intact upon its liberation on July 22, 1944. It is the best preserved Holocaust concentration camp and today functions as a museum. ‘The original crime may have been committed in Poland, but the question is if a crime has been committed in Sweden’ The painting is included in an exhibition currently on display at a gallery in the southern Swedish city of Lund. His exhibition entitled ‘Memory works’ at Martin Bryder Gallery also includes a photograph taken at the location of the ruins of Hermann Göring’s hunting cabin. The owner of the gallery, Martin Bryder, told state television SVT that he had no intention to cause upset. ‘This exhibition raises a lot of questions, and I think people should make up their own mind by visiting and asking the questions. That is all I have to say about it.’ ‘I do not want attention for the sake of attention. This is not meant to open up old wounds, but to heal them.’ Majdanek Concentration camp museum condemns the painting as an ‘inconceivable barbaric action.’ ‘It may be just an artistic act of provocation. However it is clear that the Swedish artist did not obtain the ashes legally,’ they said in a statement. ‘We hope that authorities will be able to clarify whether the remains of Majdanek victims have been stolen and desecreted.’ Carl Michael von Hausswolff, has yet to comment and has not responded to queries into the authenticity of the ashes.","Swedish artist used ashes from Majdanek concentration camp for painting .

"By . Anna Edwards . A drug dealer who was given taxpayers cash to look for a job spent his welfare money making 24,000 mobile phone calls to sell heroin and crack cocaine. Unemployed Aftar Khan, 24, pocketed up to £500 a month job seeker's allowance - but rather than look for a job, he made 78 calls and texts to clients every day for ten months to sell them drugs. Despite being repeatedly arrested and bailed Khan continued his crime racket. Aftar Khan, left, and his accomplice Aziz Ur Rahman, 21, also of Rochdale, have both been jailed . He was finally taken to court after police pursued his red VW Golf GTI when Khan jumped a red light. Twelve mobiles were seized from him and an accomplice and when they were analysed they were found to have been used to make and receive enormous number of calls during drug deals. Today Khan, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester was starting a five years and four months prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to possessing a Class A drug with intent to supply and dangerous driving. He was sentenced yesterday at Manchester Crown Court. His accomplice Aziz Ur Rahman, 21, also of Rochdale, pleaded guilty to possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply and was jailed for two years. Khan was first arrested in March, 2011 when police stopped his car after spotting him drive past a number of well-known drug addicts in the Spotland area of Rochdale. Officers found two wraps and heroin and cash on him and later his flat and a family address were searched. As well as seizing cash officers also discovered a document referring to Khan as 'Fifty' - his drug dealing nickname. Instead of looking for work, the unemployed drug dealer spent his money on selling heroin . In another incident, in August of that year, Khan - who had been bailed - led police on a car chase and was seen throwing drug wraps from the car as he was pursued. The wraps were recovered and found to contain heroin, while two mobile phone sim cards stashed in his socks were also discocered when he was arrested . Khan was again arrested, this time along with Rahman, on November 2, 2011, when the pair were seen by police again  driving in the Rochdale area and, once again, attempted to discard drugs through the window. The jettisoned drugs were retreived, analysed, and revealed to be five wraps of heroin and five wraps of crack cocaine. Then, in January last year, Khan fled police again when an officer spotted him in the notorious Falinge area of Rochdale. This time Khan threw a polythene ball under a car and fled. The ball contained 14 wraps of heroin. When police saw Khan driving the red VW GTI car later that month, he refused to stop which resulted in another car chase. Police arrested Khan after he drove his VW Golf Gti (not pictured) through a red light, onto the opposite side of the road and crashed . Khan drove through a red light, onto the opposite side of the road and crashed. Khan fled but was later found hiding out in a local heroin addict's home. Police said that as the investigation unfolded, police uncovered swathes of telephone evidence revealing the extent of Khan's drug dealing enterprise. Officers said that the 24,000 messages and calls discovered on the drug dealers' mobiles from local addicts from mobile phones and telephone boxes. Of the 12 phones seized from Khan and Rahman by police, 24,000 calls and texts were made relating to drug deals. After the case PC Gabriel Gibson of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Khan's drug dealing business stretched across Rochdale, and he was responsible for getting extremely harmful substances onto our streets through his nefarious actions. 'He was making money from his criminality but still had the front to claim Job Seeker's Allowance. 'People like Khan, who deal drugs, bring decay and misery to local communities as drugs often fuel other crimes. 'We were able to illustrate that Khan's drug dealing was far beyond the 30 wraps in total that were seized from him. 'The painstaking process of telecommunications inspection has enabled the judge to impose such stringent sentences. 'I hope this sentence serves as a deterrent to other street dealers who think they can carry small amounts of Class A drugs and get away with it.'","Aftar Khan was repeatedly arrested and bailed before being jailed .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Sara Ege has been sentenced to 17 years in jail for murdering son Yaseen Ege, 7, in Cardiff in 2010 . A mother who murdered her son for failing to learn passages of the Koran by heart was jailed for life yesterday. Sara Ege, 33, beat seven-year-old Yaseen to death and then burned his body in an attempt to destroy the evidence. Yesterday she sobbed and collapsed in the dock as she was told she will spend a minimum of 17 years in prison for the killing. Afterwards Yaseen’s father and  teachers paid tribute to a ‘beautiful’ and ‘happy’ boy. Ege had previously blamed her  husband for their son’s death. But a jury found her to be solely responsible for Yaseen’s death after she admitted  beating him ‘like a dog’. The court heard that Ege had become obsessed with her child’s apparent  inability to learn entire tracts of the Koran which he was taught after school at a mosque. On the day he died, the popular schoolboy had been due to go to a teddy bear’s picnic but did not attend because his mother wanted him to spend more time on the Koran. After he died, Ege, who had been beating her child for the previous three months, set fire to the family home in Cardiff, and it was thought the boy had died in the blaze. It later emerged that Yaseen had died before the flames took hold, and his mother was arrested on suspicion of his murder. Ege, a mathematics graduate, told investigating officers she was trying to teach her son the Koran. She said: ‘I was getting more and more frustrated. If he didn’t read it properly I would be very angry – I would hit him. Yaseen Ali, 7, was found to have died before the blaze at his home started, leading police to investigate the mother who issued a frank confession before retracting her statement . Ege (left) described her son (right) collapsing at home on the day of his death while still murmuring extracts from the Koran . Yousef Ege, 38, pictured outside Cardiff Crown Court, was cleared of causing or allowing his son's death . ‘We had a high target, I wanted him to . learn 35 pages in three months. I promised him a new bike if he could . do it. But Yaseen wasn’t very good. After a year of practice he had only . learned a chapter. ‘I was getting all this bad stuff in . my head, like I couldn’t concentrate, I was getting angry too much, I . would shout at Yaseen all the time. I was getting very wild and I hit . Yaseen with a stick on his back like a dog. He would be doing his work . and wouldn’t  complain and I would hit and hit him more and more. ‘He was a good boy but I used to get angry and he wouldn’t even stop me or say anything to anyone.’ Ege hit Yaseen with a stick, a hammer, a rolling pin and a slipper as well as repeatedly punching him. She later told her GP: ‘It is the . devil which is telling me to do all these bad things. I have become so . harsh, I even killed my own son.’ Ege also told the doctor she felt ‘100 . per cent better’ after her son died. Yesterday she collapsed during . sentencing at Cardiff Crown Court which followed her convictions last . month for murder and perverting the course of justice. Mr Justice Wyn Williams told her . Yaseen had been subjected to ‘prolonged cruelty’ and suffered a ‘good . deal of pain’ before he died from internal injuries in July 2010. He . added: ‘This was a dreadful crime.’ Ege had previously falsely accused her . taxi-driver husband Yousef Ege, 38, of being a violent bully who beat . her and claimed he was their son’s real killer. Yaseen Ali's funeral drew large crowds from the Cardiff community saddened by the loss of the seven-year-old . Yaseen Ali's funeral in Cardiff following his death in July 2010 . He was later cleared of . causing or allowing his son’s death by failing to act to prevent it and . told the jury he had never seen his wife raise her hand. Both parents had encouraged Yaseen to . attend advanced classes at their local mosque because they wanted him to . become ‘Hafiz’ – an Islamic term for someone who memorises the Koran. Pathologists found multiple  injuries . on Yaseen’s body including broken ribs, a fractured arm and a fractured . finger. Barbecue lighter fuel was found on Ege’s clothing when she was . arrested after the post-mortem examination. She was found guilty of . murder and perverting the course of justice by burning Yaseen’s body. Yesterday her husband said of his son: . ‘He was loved by all who had known him due to his beautiful nature and . his high academic level.’ Ann James, head teacher at Radnor . Primary School in Cardiff where Yaseen was a pupil, said: ‘He was a . delightful little boy and beautifully behaved who always had a smile on . his face.’","Sara Ege, 33, beat son with a stick and burnt his body to conceal injuries .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A man who murdered the mother of his three young children in a 'savage and prolonged' knife attack in the back of a taxi has been jailed for life. Junior Saleem Oakes, who killed Natasha Trevis five days after a social worker 'let slip' that she had aborted a fourth child, was ordered to serve at least 22 years before being considered for parole. Birmingham Crown Court heard that Oakes, 28, of Birmingham, stabbed his victim a total of 26 times in the head, face, neck, chest, back and legs in the city last August. Junior Saleem Oakes, 28, left, stabbed his former lover Natasha Trevis, 22, right, 26 times last August . Oakes had been due stand trial for the murder of his former girlfriend Miss Trevis, who was 22 and just 5ft 1in, but pleaded guilty to the charge before a jury was sworn in. Sentencing Oakes, Judge William Davis QC described the killing in Northfield, in the south-west of the city, as an 'act of savagery' which had robbed 'three tiny children' of their mother. The judge told Oakes: 'All of (your children) will grow up knowing that their father killed their mother. 'She was a good young mother, a mother to three young children aged three, two and one.' Judge Davis told Oakes: 'By your savage attack on her, you have taken her away from both her children and indeed her mother. Natasha Trevis loved her children 'with all her heart' 'I described the attack as savage because you inflicted 26 separate wounds with a knife - many of them required severe force, and many of them were inflicted from behind. 'This young woman was either turning her back on you or trying to escape. 'She did escape from the taxi but you chased her and continued the attack even as she tried desperately to save herself.' Addressing Miss Trevis' family, the judge said: 'I am a father myself so I can imagine . what it must be like to have 20-year-old daughter snatched away from me. 'You have my condolences and those of the court.' Opening the facts of the case, prosecutor David Matthew said the murder was committed on the morning of Oakes’s 28th birthday, August 7 last year, as the taxi headed towards the victim’s mother’s home. He said the taxi had been called for Miss Trevis but Oakes had joined her, hoping for a lift to another address. The prosecutor told . the court that shortly before the attack, a social worker had accidentally let slip to Oakes that Miss Trevis had . terminated their fourth child. The couple were no longer living together, and social services were involved with them. Violent: Junior Oakes, who has been jailed for life, has a history of domestic violence . Daylight murder: The scene of the attack at Dimsdale Road and Hoggs Lane, Birmingham . Quoting the statement from the taxi driver, Mr Dalton, the prosecutor told the court he heard Miss Trevis say to Oakes  that they ‘didn’t need to talk about their relationship because they didn’t have one’. Jailed for life: Junior Oakes will not get parole for at least 22 years . He added: 'Mr . Dalton took this as an ordinary boyfriend and girlfriend argument, and . heard her say ""Put that away"" but she didn’t sound upset. 'Mr Dalton said: ""He started to get really angry with her. He said ‘You caused this, you are a disgrace, you aborted my child"". 'She . said ""He’s stabbing me, he’s stabbing me"". '""I couldn’t see him stabbing . her, just him very very close; he must have been stabbing her. '""I got out of the car and she got out and he got out; she must have been stabbed, she must have been running on adrenaline. '""I ran to where she was so I was between them; he was holding the knife in his right hand. '""She tried to get back in the car, but he caught her before she could get in. '""He stabbed her, stabbing her again, stabbing her in the chest. She fell to the ground or was pushed and he ran off.""' The court heard that during the 'persistent' attack, the knife used by Oakes pierced Miss Trevis' liver, lungs and heart.  One stab wound to her brain was 10cm deep. The taxi driver called emergency services but despite desperate attempts to save the victim, she was declared dead at the scene. Oakes was arrested nearby on that evening after a member of the public spotted him lying in a garden. After his arrest, he initially claimed that his ex-partner had produced the knife and then stabbed herself. Defence counsel Timothy Raggatt QC said Oakes had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, and it was 'doubtful' whether the offence was premeditated. Scene of the murder: Natasha Trevis tried to flee the taxi but was chased and stabbed again . The court heard that Oakes, who met Miss Trevis when she was 18, was illiterate and had a history of domestic violence. Social services were involved with the couple and Oakes . was no longer living at the family home by the time of the murder on . August 7. During discussions with social . services five days earlier, a social worker had mentioned in front of . Oakes that Miss Trevis had had a previous pregnancy terminated. Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Michelle Ohren, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Natasha was a loving and devoted mother to her three children and she had everything to live for. 'She was very close to her family and this has devastated them all.' In a statement issued by police, Natasha’s mother Joanne Hewitt paid tribute to her daughter. 'Tasha was my diamond, the star of my life,' she said. 'She was beautiful, caring and loved her three children with all her heart. 'When he killed her, he killed me. He has taken a very precious person from our family and broken us in two.'","Junior Saleem Oakes, 28, stabbed former girlfriend after discovering she'd had an abortion of their fourth child .

"By . Emma Reynolds . A teacher has been summoned to court and faces a £1,000 fine because her wheelie bin juts out just 12 inches beyond the boundary of her home. Alex Young, 47, is to appear at Stevenage Magistrates' Court after her local council said the grey plastic bin could present a hazard to drivers and disabled people. It said the bin could prevent grass from being cut - even though there is not a patch of green in sight around the rear of her three-bedroom home. Ms Young was also told that the bin's appearance could 'negatively impact on the street scene environment'. Facing a fine: Alex Young's wheelie bin juts out just 12 inches from the strip of wood that marks the edge of her property . The frustrated householder has attacked the move by Stevenage Borough Council as 'complete nonsense' and a waste of taxpayers' money. She pointed out that Stevenage Borough Council's own grit bins and concrete posts jut further into the road than her bin. It has told her to place the bin in the driveway that leads to her garage - but a frustrated Miss Young says it would then block access to her home. The teacher, who works at Hitchin Boys' School and offers private tutoring, says she has nowhere to put the solitary . bin other than on the raised concrete area behind her terraced house. She has accused the council of using bullying tactics to drag her into court. 'It is a complete and utter waste of taxpayers' money,' she told Mail Online. 'You have no idea how much stress it's caused me - I've since been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and one of the aggravating causes is stress. 'I have to be down there [at court] on a Monday afternoon and my students have their A-levels days later. I should be there helping my students and instead I'm arguing over a bin and having my time wasted. 'Sharon Taylor, the council leader, just got an OBE for caring about the people of Stevenage. It's appalling'. Miss Young, a widow since her husband died of motor neurone disease nine years ago, will plead not guilty at the hearing later this month. The charge brought under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 alleges that she failed in the 'placing of receptacles as required for the purpose of . avoiding a nuisance or detriment to the amenities of the area'. 'Obstruction and arson risk': Miss Young, right, says she has faced more than a year of stress over her bin since she was sent the first letter by Stevenage Borough Council on December 12, 2011, right . The council says the bin is on 'public land' and is an obstruction to the highway and to people who are visually impaired or use wheelchairs. Miss Young says the row goes back to 2011 when . she complained about the lid of her recycling box being damaged after it was left in the road by refuse collectors. On one occasion, her recycling was not . taken away after an empty Ben and Jerry's ice cream carton was found to . contain some plastic. She and her neighbours, a retired couple, found themselves having to get out of cars to move emptied boxes and wheelie bins. In the end, Miss Young asked the . council to remove the recycling bins and she has been using a . solitary grey wheelie bin for all her rubbish ever since. In December 2011, she received a Fixed . Penalty Notice from the council notifying her she had to pay a fine of . £100 for the 'Incorrect presentation of waste receptacles'. Their target: The council's letter says the bin could impede to grass cutting - even though there is barely a blade of grass to be seen on the quiet cul-de-sac . Inches out of place: The 47-year-old's bin has been labelled a potential hazard for disabled people and a blot on the landscape . She was told in the summer she could appeal against the fine, which she duly did, and then heard nothing more. Then, on December 20 2012, she came home to find a . letter telling her that she was to appear in Stevenage . Magistrates' Court on New Year's Eve over the issues with her rubbish, and could have to pay out up to £1,000. 'Because Christmas was coming up, I . couldn't speak to anyone at the council or the court. It came completely . out of the blue and gave me no time. 'I had lodged my appeal but then . heard nothing for months. I had made arrangements to go away for the new . year and the letter spoilt completely my Christmas and my holiday . because I was so stressed by it all.' On New Year's Eve, she managed to . contact the court and her case has been put back. She faces a two-hour hearing later this month. Stevenage Borough Council could not be reached for comment today.","Alex Young was told her bin could present a risk to disabled people .

"By . Larisa Brown . Declan Lloyd, 21, pictured, tricked his grandmother into helping him pick up money he stole in a bank raid . A grandmother was arrested after her grandson tricked her into giving him a lift to pick up money he stole in a robbery. Declan Lloyd, 21, asked his 68-year old grandmother to drive him to a suburban cul-de-sac saying he needed to pick up his car. But as she innocently dropped him off, a team of officers waiting nearby pounced on the pair as Lloyd picked up the money he took in a bank raid from a stolen Peugeot 207. The shocked grandmother was arrested and quizzed on suspicion of robbery alongside her grandson. She was later freed without charge when police established she knew nothing about the raid. Lloyd, from Salford, Greater Manchester was sentenced to four years in jail after he was found guilty of robbery. The raid occurred at 2.35pm on April 24 last year as a security guard was delivering cash at a Barclays Bank in Peel Green, near Eccles. Lloyd approached the guard from behind then grabbed the cash box which said to have contained a substantial amount of money. He then jumped into a stolen Peugeot 207, which he later dumped seven miles away in Radcliffe, before fleeing the area on foot. Police scrambled the force helicopter to hunt the robber from the air whilst a team of detectives uniformed police and traffic officers carried out a ground search of the local and surrounding areas. Shortly afterwards officers found the stolen Peugeot, noticed the cashbox inside and lay in wait to see of Lloyd would come back to the scene and pick it up. Just minutes later at 3pm, Lloyd turned up in his grandmother's car and was seen collecting the cash box and putting it into her vehicle. A police source said: 'Officers suspected someone would come back for the cash as it was still in the car but they never thought for one minute he would bring his own gran with him. The raid occurred at 2.35pm on April 24 last year as a security guard was delivering cash at a Barclays Bank in Peel Green, near Eccles, pictured . 'Police had to arrest her because she was at the scene of a crime but officers soon realised she had nothing to do with it. 'She was utterly shocked not only at being arrested but also by her grandson's behaviour. It has to take a pretty heartless crook to take their nan with them on a job.' Lloyd denied robbery but was convicted after a trial at Manchester Crown Court. No-one was hurt in the raid. Today Detective Constable Justin Bryant, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Following this robbery we commenced a thorough and comprehensive search for the stolen vehicle and due to the efforts of officers on the ground it was quickly located. Lloyd, from Salford, Greater Manchester was sentenced to four years in jail after he was found guilty of robbery at Manchester Crown Court . 'Due to their endeavours, and partly thanks to Lloyd's dim-wittedness in returning to the scene so quickly, we were able to identify the offender, locate the getaway car and recover the stolen cash in about 30 minutes. 'Lloyd did not think twice about targeting the security guard and even roped his unsuspecting grandmother in to try and get away with this crime but thanks to the efforts of all involved he is now starting a four year prison sentence.' At the time of the raid, Det Insp Robert Cousen said: 'Thankfully the security worker was not hurt in anyway but has obviously been left shocked that someone stole the cash box in broad daylight. 'He was going about his daily business and it is wrong that he was targeted in such a way.'","Declan Lloyd, 21, grabbed cash box off security guard outside Barclays .

"By . Steve Doughty . One in five Britons will be from an ethnic minority by 2050, state-sponsored research predicted yesterday. The development of minority groups will outpace the increase in numbers of those who describe themselves as 'white British', the report said. Black, Asian and other minority groups will move from cities to affluent suburbs as they grow in prosperity and status, the report predicts. Diverse: Members of the Bangladeshi community in Whitechapel Market, in east London. Researchers say by 2050, one in five Britons will be from an ethnic minority . White people from elsewhere in the world - notably from Europe, but also from Australia, New Zealand and America - will be the fastest growing section of society. The scale of the minority population in 2051 will be two-and-a-half times the minority share of the population at the beginning of the century, the findings said. They put the ethnic minority share of the population in 2001 at eight per cent. Increases on the scale predicted in the report by academics from Leeds University mean the non-white ethnic minority population, which numbered under five million in 2001, will be more than three times bigger in 2051, at 15.6 million of a projected total British population of 78 million. The report, sponsored by the Government's Economic and Social Research Council, comes in the wake of national census figures which said the non-white ethnic minority share of the population last year was 14 per cent. According to the census findings, 86 per cent of the population count themselves as white and 80 per cent as 'white British' The 'white British' population has dropped to 45 per cent, fewer than half, in London, the census said. The report was by academics from Leeds University and sponsored by the Government's Economic and Social Research Council . However the ethnic minority population will spread out over coming decades as families who arrived in London looking for work become successful and follow the middle-class flight from the city to outer towns and suburbs where there are better schools and transport and less crime. Report author Professor Philip Rees said: 'At a regional level, the ethnic minorities will shift out of deprived inner city areas to the suburbs and surrounding towns. 'This echoes the way that white groups have migrated in the past with the growth of the middle classes. In particular the Black and Asian populations of affluent local authorities will increase significantly.' The increase in the 'other white' population will be mainly a result of immigration from Europe, Professor Rees said. 'One of the most surprising findings was . the scale of increase in the so-called other ethnic groups representing . people from lots of other countries outside of the main origin groups.' Report author . Large-scale migration from Eastern Europe has been under way since 2004, when Poland and seven other Eastern European countries joined the EU, and the Home Office predicted 13,000 workers would come to Britain as a result. More than a million Eastern Europeans have since arrived in Britain to work, and there are more than half a million Eastern Europeans in the population. Other European countries are also sending greater numbers of migrants. Young French men and women are now arriving in London in numbers to take advantage of work opportunities and lower tax rates than they can find at home. Apart from non-British whites, the other fastest growing group in the population will be minority groups from countries other than those in Asia and Africa which have long sent migrants to Britain. Professor Rees said: 'One of the most surprising findings was the scale of increase in the so-called other ethnic groups representing people from lots of other countries outside of the main origin groups.' The 78 million prediction for the overall population made by the report means that academics believe the country is bound to exceed the 70 million population point considered by many analysts to be likely to overstretch housing, transport, water, power and education resources. ONS projections suggest that the 70 million population will be reached in 14 to 15 years' time.","Report predicts white people from abroad will grow fastest as a group .

"By . Steve Doughty . Three towns and cities have joined London in having a minority white British population. Researchers say more than 50 per cent of people living in Leicester, Luton and Slough are either foreign or from an ethnic minority. Birmingham is expected to have a similar make-up by 2020. Changing face of Britain: Three places outside London have a minority of white Britons. This graph shows the growth of other non-white groups in the UK since 1991 in thousands . Diverse: In Luton (pictured) 55 per cent of residents are non-white British but 80 per cent of its total population say they feel British . The findings are based on the 2011 national census, in which residents were asked which ethnic group they were in. The census also broke the white . population down into those who see themselves as white British and those . who consider they are ‘white other’ – a group that will include . immigrants from Europe as well as Australasia and America. London has already been shown to have a white British population of only 45 per cent. Yesterday’s breakdown showed that . those who call themselves white British amount to 45 per cent of the . population of Leicester, 45 per cent of the population of Luton and only . just over a third, 35 per cent, of the people of Slough. The white populations in all three are . swollen by the presence of white migrants, including high numbers of . Eastern Europeans who have arrived since their countries joined the EU . and they were given the right to live in Britain in 2004. The analysis, by academics at the . University of Manchester, said the comparative decline of white British . numbers does not mean that ethnically mixed towns and cities have become . less British. The children of immigrants who were . born in this country tend to regard themselves as British, it said. ‘Eighty-one per cent of Luton’s residents have a British national . identity while 45 per cent are of the white British ethnic group,’ added . the report. ‘We already know from other sources . that British identity is felt at least as strongly by those of minority . ethnicity as those of white British ethnicity.’ ‘This is the case for people of . similar age and background born in the UK: younger, more highly educated . people, and those born overseas all express less strong British . identity.’ It also said segregation is decreasing and residential mixing of different groups became more common between 2001 and 2011. According to the research, two thirds . of Leicester’s 330,000 population were born in the UK. The city, it . found, has 17 ethnic groups more than 1,000 strong. In Luton, only 91,000 of the 203,000 population say they are white British, but 165,000 people regard themselves as British. In Slough, of 140,000 people, 48,000 say they are white British but 108,000 say their identity is British. Results for Newham in East London, . where fewer than one in six are white British, show two thirds of people . say they are British. Ludi Simpson, professor of population . studies at Manchester University, said: ‘We need to understand changing . ethnic composition to understand our citizens’ changing needs. ‘Housing, school meals, care of older . people, cultural and entertainment facilities, funeral services and many . other aspects of local services are intrinsically affected.’","All three communities have a white British population of less than 50%, 2011 UK census shows, and Birmingham will be the same by 2020 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Almost 1,500 foreign prisoners are being held in British jails after the end of their sentence because the authorities cannot deport them, new figures reveal. More than two years ago David Cameron promised to tear up agreements that mean convicts cannot be returned home without their consent to cut costs. It comes as ministers boasted that a wave of Albanian prisoners will be sent back to their home country to finish their sentences under a new deal signed today. The UK Border Agency said deportation was often delayed by 'human rights challenges' One in eight of all prisoners in . Britain are from overseas, and 1,466 have completed their sentences but . are being held behind bars while officials battle to have them kicked . out of the country. On average a prison place costs £40,000-a-year, meaning the taxpayer could be footing a bill of up to £60million. Critics said the British public should not be paying to keep locked hundreds of offenders who should not be in the country. Last year it emerged that despite the Prime Minister’s pledge to tackle the number of foreign prisoners, just 62 had been sent home. In the last ten years, the number of foreign nationals in prisons in . England and Wales has doubled to around 10,900 and now represents more . than 14 per cent of the total prison population. Ministers admitted that prisons and immigration removal centres were forced to detain foreign nationals because there was nowhere else for them to go. Immigration minister Mark Harper could not say how long foreign criminals were being held after completing their sentence but Tory MP Priti Patel said it should be made easier to deport them . A total of 77 out of nearly 200 Albanian prisoners are currently eligible for transfer under the agreement between the two nations, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said. The move, which is expected to save taxpayers around £25 million over the next 10 years, should see the first batch of prisoners deported in around two months time. The compulsory prisoner transfer agreement, which will save Britain £2 million in the first year, was signed by prisons minister Jeremy Wright and the Albanian minister of justice, Eduard Halimi. It is the first agreement providing for transfer from the UK to outside the European Union. All eligible cases have been referred to the UK Border Agency for deportation, the MoJ said. Mr Wright said: 'The co-operation of the Albanian authorities has been crucial in ensuring these negotiations have proved so fruitful. 'The British Government wants more foreign national prisoners to serve their sentences in their home country.' Albanian nationals make up the 16th highest foreign national population in English and Welsh prisons. Immigration minister Mark Harper said: . ‘In September 2012, 547 foreign national offenders were detained by the . UK Border Agency in prisons following completion of their custodial . sentence. ‘A further 919 . foreign national offenders were detained beyond the end of their . sentence in immigration removal centres.’ He could not say for how long . they have been held. However, the average number of days between a foreign national finishing a sentence and being removed fell from 131 days in 2008 to 74 in 2011. Efforts have been made to speed up deportations by starting the process earlier. Anyone who is deported is subject to a re-entry ban, for a minimum of 10 years. While numbers are down by around a fifth since April 2010, the Home Office admitted it was struggling to cut them further because offenders claim their human rights will be reached if they are sent home. Tory MP Priti Patel, who obtained the figures, seized on the figures as proof the Human Rights Act needed to be scrapped. ‘Taxpayers should not be paying for foreign offenders to remain in the UK after their prison sentence has ended. ‘They should be deported from the UK straight away. 'While the reduction in the numbers remaining in the UK under this Government is welcome, the laws that block removals and enable foreign offenders to remain in Britain, such as the Human Rights Act, must be scrapped.’ In 2010 there were 701 foreign offenders . detailed in jail after their sentence, which fell to 516 in 2011 but . rose again to 552 in 2012. The number of people held in immigration . detention centres after completing a prison sentence has fallen from . 1,213 in 2010 to 812 in 2012. David Cameron has been frustrated at the government's ability to kick out foreign criminals . A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘We will always detain foreign criminals awaiting deportation if they pose a risk to the public. ‘Those who abuse the privilege of coming to the UK by breaking our laws should be removed at the earliest opportunity and we are speeding up the deportation process. ‘Deportation can be delayed for many reasons, including human rights challenges and a lack of co-operation by the offender. This can lengthen the period of time an individual spends in immigration detention.’ More than 175 foreign criminals were deported under Operation Nexus, a . joint initiative launched by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) and the . Metropolitan Police Service at the start of September. Among the criminals removed from the UK under Nexus were Indian national . Manindhar . Annamdevula, 24, who was arrested for attempted fraud at . Harrods in October, some five months after his visa had expired. Shahnoza Sayfieva, 35, from Uzbekistan, was arrested in October on . suspicion of blackmail and soon deported, while Ugandan Julius Amet, 36, . was arrested in October for a public order offence and later deported.","Immigration minister Mark Harper admits hundreds of foreigners cannot be deported after doing time in the UK .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ed Miliband was today accused of ‘total hypocrisy’ after running up a £135,000 bill for a taxpayer-funded chauffeur driven limo while sanctioning attacks on cars used by government ministers. The Labour leader faced calls to use public transport or invest in a bicycle instead of being driven around London in car paid for by the state. It comes after Labour blasted transport minister Simon Burns for being driven home instead of using the train, accusing him of being ‘out of touch’ and telling ministers to ‘get out of their limos’. Labour leader Ed Miliband has clocked up a £135,000 bill for his official car funded by the taxpayer, despite his party accusing ministers of being 'out of touch; for not using public transport . Tory MPs said Mr Miliband should practice what he preaches and stop being picked up from his 'multi-million pound house in Primrose Hill in a taxpayer-funded car'. Instead he should buy a 'bicycle and a hat with a bobble on top' to get around town. Official figures released in Parliament show Mr Miliband’s official car – provided to the Leader of the Opposition – has cost taxpayers £135,270.50 since the beginning of September 2010. From September 2010 until March 31 2011, the vehicle cost the Cabinet Office £33,592.71. In the year from April 2011, the car cost £56,645.05 and from April 2012 until December 31 2012, the Cabinet Office spent £45,032.74. The revelation is especially embarrassing for Mr Miliband after Labour attacked the government for its use of official cars. It emerged that transport minister Mr Burns was using an £80,000-a-year pool car to be driven from his home in Chelmsford, where he is MP, to Westminster every day. He claimed he was able to work in the car but after a furious public backlash in the week when rail fares rocketed, he decided to let the train take the strain. He was pictured waiting on the platform for the 5.58am, and was forced to stand in the corridor for the 36 minute journey from Chelmsford to Liverpool Street, London. But Maria Eagle, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, used Mr Burns's car travel to score political points. ‘No wonder ministers are so out of touch with the eye-watering cost of rail fares when they are spending tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money being driven around all day,’ she said. ‘They should get out of their limos and speak to those hard-pressed commuters who have this week seen the cost of their season ticket rocket by hundreds of pounds.’ Today Tory MPs seized on the remarks to say Mr Miliband should follow his frontbench colleague’s advice and ‘get out of his limo’ too. Transport minister Simon Burns was criticised for being driven home to Chelmsford in a government car, so he let the train take the strain last week, and was pictured looking cold on the platform and then forced to stand . The figures for Mr Miliband’s car use were released in a parliamentary question tabled by Tory MP Chris Skidmore. Mr Skidmore told MailOnline: Ed Miliband isn't even in government yet he is still using taxpayer's money to traipse across the country preaching the politics of One Nation, when it is hardly One Nation to be picked up from outside your multi-million pound house in Primrose Hill in a taxpayer-funded car. Mr Miliband has refused to follow David Cameron's example and be pictured cycling to Westminster . 'He needs to have a long hard look at himself. At a time when hardworking people are struggling to pay the costs of transport it is unacceptable for Ed Miliband to be not practicing what he preaches. 'I am sure Maria Eagle will want to be consistent in her approach and will be having a long, hard chat with her leader to ensure that there is no hypicrasy going on.' Ian Liddell-Grainger said Mr Miliband should find alternative ways to get around to prove he is in touch with the public mood: ‘He would look fantastic in an anorak on the train. It would be the geek exactly where he should be. ‘He needs to cut his bill down, get a bicycle, an anorak and a hat with a bobble on the top. ‘There is complete hypocrisy here. It is just ridiculous. Every minister is trying to do what they can to go on public transport and reduce costs. ‘But where we have got a Labour frontbencher attacking a junior minister when her own leader is just flaunting it as well is just ridiculous. I think Maria Eagle should hang her head in shame.’ Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'Everyone in power owes it to taxpayers to look for ways in which they themselves can save money. 'Any politician with access to a chauffeur-driven car must be looking to reduce the burden they are placing on the taxpayer for using that facility.' Transport minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘The Government Car Service provides an allocated car for the Leader of the Official Opposition. This is consistent with the practice for the previous Leader of the Official Opposition.’ A Labour Party Spokesperson said: 'When the Conservative Party was in opposition David Cameron was allocated and regularly used a Government car. David Cameron’s own transport minister has admitted Ed Miliband’s use of a car is entirely consistent with that practice. 'Ed Miliband regularly uses public transport and attends many official functions and meetings in his role of the Leader of the Opposition.'","Labour leader runs up huge bill for Leader of the Opposition's car .

"By . Steven Wright . Allegations that members of an ‘Establishment’ paedophile ring sexually abused boys in council care during the 1980s are to be investigated by police, it emerged yesterday. Former ministers, senior MPs, top police officers and those with links to the royal household are alleged to have indecently assaulted vulnerable, under-age males. Claims that showbusiness celebrities were part of the same ring will also be investigated. According to reports, the inquiry will focus on boys who were living at Grafton Close children’s home in Richmond, South-West London, in the 1980s. Allegations of child abuse in the early 1980s at the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, London were made by Tom Watson MP in the House of Commons . It is claimed the boys were taken from . Grafton Close to Elm Guest House in Rocks Lane, a suburban street in . nearby Barnes where they were subjected to appalling sexual abuse. One source is said to have suggested that Anthony Blunt, former Keeper . of the Queen’s Pictures and an exposed Soviet spy, used to go to sordid . parties at the guest house. Others are said to have spoken of two High . Court judges and a Foreign Office official attending. Detectives . launched the probe, codenamed Operation Fernbridge, after they obtained a . list of ‘prominent people’ who allegedly stayed at the guest house in . the 1980s. The list is reported to have been compiled by a veteran child . protection campaigner. Grafton Close shut more than 20 years ago and police were keen to stress . that the abuse claims are historic and are not linked with the current . occupants of Elm Guest House, which has been converted into flats. Allegations over Elm Guest House first emerged at a 1990 inquest into the suicide of its German manager Carole Kasir. A Met Police inquiry, . called Operation Fernbridge, is under way into allegations about child . abuse in the early 1980s . Child protection campaigners said at the hearing that in 1988 she told . them boys from council-run Grafton Close had been taken to the . guesthouse and abused. Mrs Kasir had a 1982 conviction for running a brothel. But campaigners . said the manager had no idea at the time of the child abuse. Officers working on the probe are said to be liaising with Labour MP Tom . Watson, who told the Commons in October that politicians belonging to a . paedophile network had used their powerful connections to escape . justice. He sensationally claimed a ‘senior aide of a former prime . minister’ had links to a member of a child sex ring. He added that a file of evidence used to convict a man called Peter . Righton of importing child pornography in 1992 contained ‘clear . intelligence’ of a sex abuse gang. Peter Righton, a leading consultant on children's homes who was found guilty of pornographic offences. Mr Watson MP said the file used to convict him could contain new evidence . Raising the issue during Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Watson said: . ‘The leads were not followed up, but if the file still exists I want to . ensure that the Metropolitan Police secure the evidence, re-examine it . and investigate clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile . network linked to Parliament and Number 10.’ Prime Minister David Cameron said he would look at the case ‘very carefully and see what the Government can do to help’. Later Mr Watson revealed further details of the allegations in his . personal blog saying he had been contacted by a former child protection . specialist who was concerned that Righton’s suspicious connections were . not fully investigated. ‘The contact, who has seen the letters, claimed that one paedophile in . particular was of great concern. He said the paedophile, who worked with . children, boasted of a key aide to a former PM who could help get hold . of indecent images of children,’ wrote Mr Watson. In a statement, Scotland Yard said Operation Fernbridge would be led by the Child Abuse Investigation Command. It added: ‘The allegations under Operation Fernbridge were initially . assessed under Operation Fairbank which was information passed to police . by MP Tom Watson. Operation Fernbridge reached the threshold for a . criminal investigation.’ Scotland Yard asked anyone with information to contact police on 020 7161 0500.","It follows allegations made in October last year by Tom Watson MP .

"By . Helen Pow . Charged: Doctor Ali Salim, pictured, is charged with murdering pregnant mother of two, Deanna Ballman, after she responded to a Craigslist ad . An Ohio doctor allegedly obsessed with photographing young women has been charged with raping and killing a pregnant 23-year-old after she responded to an ad on Craigslist. Pakistani-born Dr Ali Salim is accused of murdering Deanna Ballman, of Pataskala, and her unborn baby last summer by injecting her with a lethal dose of heroin and then doing 'inhumane' things to her corpse. Ballman, who was nine-months pregnant and had two kids at home, was found dead in the backseat of her car in woods outside of New Albany on August 1. Salim, 44, pleaded not guilty today to two counts of murder as well as rape, felonious assault, corrupting another with drugs, kidnapping, tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse. He is expected to be released on $1 million bail as soon as Friday. According to Ballman's family, the woman was responding to a housecleaning ad and called to say she wasn't feeling well, which was the last they heard of her. However, reports suggest she may have met with Salim after he put a call out for models. Salim has been at the center of the investigation into Ballman's death for months, with 10TV reporting in September that investigators had searched the doctor's Ohio home and removed a laptop, camera and other items. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Deanna Ballman, pictured, was killed by Salim in the summer of 2012 . Tragic: Ballman, pictured left and right, was nine-months pregnant and a mother-of-two kids, pictured right . Assistant county prosecutor Kyle Rohrer . said Salim treated Ballman's body 'in a very inhumane way,' but wouldn't . elaborate on how. Prosecutors believe the doctor, who has gone by the cyber handle 'extremephotoenthusias,' has sought out other women through Craigslist and may be a risk if released. Rohrer said other women had responded to ads placed by Salim, including one woman who said Salim wanted to paint internal organs on her body. According to an email obtained by 10TV in September the doctor wrote that he was willing to pay $300 if young women can keep their work 'drama free,' adding 'I just don't need the drama.' In court: Dr. Ali Salim, pictured in May 2013, waits for deputies to escort him from the courtroom after he pleaded not guilty to charges of killing Ballman (he changed his plea today) Unclear: Ballman's family claim she was responding to a housecleaning ad though reports suggest she met with Salim to model for him . He also told women that they could 'wear . anything but black or brown bra, and panties are essential. I will take . most shots from the back.' Ballman died of a heroin overdose but also had morphine and codine in her blood at the time of her death and her urine contained morphine, monoacetylmorphine, codeine, acetylocodine and diacetylmorphine. Salim will likely be on house arrest once he's released from Delaware County Jail and must surrender his passport and wear a GPS monitoring device until his trial scheduled for early May. When asked if Ballman was responding to a housecleaning ad before she was killed, Delaware County Prosecutor Carol O'Brien said on Thursday 'that's not quite what we've found.' Delaware County Judge Duncan Whitney rejected prosecutors' arguments for bail of $5 million on the grounds that Salim, a Pakistan native, had reason to leave the country. Prosecutors and Salim's attorney both said they expect Salim to make bail. Inhumane: Salim allegedly did inhumane things to Ballman's body . Fetish: Salim reportedly was fixated on photographing young women like Ballman, pictured . Rohrer said Salim tried to tamper with evidence and would be a flight risk once he learns that investigators recovered it. 'We believe this is not an isolated incident and that he remains a threat to others in the public if he's released,' Rohrer said. O'Brien declined to elaborate after the hearing on what exactly Salim is accused of doing to Ballman's corpse. Salim's attorney said he has represented Salim since last summer and throughout the investigation, including a meeting with investigators in October where Salim provided hair samples. Booked: Salim, pictured, was booked into Delaware County Jail on Wednesday . Crime scene: Ballman's body was found in her car, pictured, in a wooded area near New Albany on August 1, 2012 . 'If he was going to flee, it would have happened,' argued Sam Shamansky, who also noted Salim has been in the country for two decades. Salim, dressed in an orange jail suit, sat at a table with Shamansky during the hearing and answered questions from the judge.

"By . Steve Robson . A former hotel receptionist has been ordered to sell her Footballers' Wives-style mansion after police discovered it was built using her gangster ex-boyfriend's drug money. Neighbours had assumed Daniella Green, 36, and David Statham were Lottery winners when the six-bedroom stone detached villa was erected in Littleborough, Greater Manchester in 2003. In fact, Statham had just got out of jail after being convicted for masterminding a £7.5million cannabis ring. Luxury: The house in Littleborough, Greater Manchester, has six bedrooms, four bathrooms and swimming pool and an under-floor heating system . Guilty: Daniella Green, 36, has been ordered to sell the mansion built by her drug dealer ex-boyfriend David Statham, right, who died in 2006 . A judge has now ordered Green to sell the luxury property - once valued at £1.2m but now believed to worth around £600,000 - to pay back £535,000. Green took control of the mansion in 2006, after Statham - whose gangland nickname was 'The Beak' - died in a quad biking accident aged 44. The villa - given the title Marlborough House - has four bathrooms, three reception rooms, a swimming pool, a canopy, balcony and a £21,000 underfloor heating system. Dead: David Statham was convicted for conspiracy to supply drugs and jailed for nine years in 2001. He died in a quad biking accident after being released in 2006 . Green met Statham when she was just 17 while working in a hotel in Rochdale which he used as one of three bases to run a huge drugs operation. He ran a crime racket which smuggled 250kg cannabis shipments in lorries from Spain into the UK over a year long period. Police investigating him said he used 40 different payphones in Rochdale and Stockport in a bid to . give them the slip giving orders on imminent deals to a . team of couriers, drivers and distributors. Statham spent his drug money on trips so the casinos - sometimes spending up to £60,000 a time using . an alias and in one month alone bought chips totalling £250,000, losing . £100,000 at the gambling tables. In 2001 he was finally caught and jailed for nine years for . conspiracy to supply drugs. Green stood by her man after his . conviction and shortly before his release she legitimately bought the plot . of land for £55,000 in the Pennines hills where Stratham then built the house. Manchester Crown Court was told how a . neighbour recalled Statham as being a 'nasty man.' During his trial in 2001 a Proceeds of Crime Act heard how he went on the run in France after fleeing police by . jumping through a back window of his former home in Bury. The father of two was at large for nine months before being tracked down to the Cote d'Azur and extradited back to Britain. He and Green later split up . after she accused of him of being controlling and moved into her . mother's home. But after she died she discovered she was still on the deeds to the house and took sole control. Daniella Green took control of the luxury property after Stratham died in a quad biking accident in 2006 . A former receptionist, Green met Stratham when she was just 17 and he used her hotel as a base for his drug-smuggling empire . Police uncovered the asset after Green was arrested in connection with the criminal activities of her new partner Scott Baker. Officers raided a safety deposit box she had set up in Manchester and found £117,000 in cash. Police popped the locks on a vault owned . by Baker and Green at St James Safe Deposit Co, at Oxford Street in March 2010. They examined her finances and established she could not have financed the property on her wage. Detectives suspected all the cash . belonged to Statham but days before Green and Baker were due to go on trial for money laundering, Baker admitted . he had stolen £47,000 of it from his family hotel business. The remaining £70,000 was found to have come legitimately from the hotel where he worked as a director. At a Proceeds of Crime Hearing, Miss Suzanne Goddard QC, prosecuting said Green was . registered with the local authority to pay council tax and after . Statham's death she treated the property as her own - although there was . no evidence she lived there. She said: 'Green's finances were such that she . could not finance the house as she was of limited means. 'She . made a statement to police that she was being harassed by David . Statham. She stated he was a well known criminal and acknowledged that . he had been involved in drug running and car crime. 'Upon . his release the relationship deteriorated and in December 2004 she . moved to her mother's yet suffered repeated harassment and made a . complaint to police. 'On . 27th April 2006 she contacted police to say that she no longer wished to . continue with the complaint. He died two months later. She continued to . treat the house as her own and paid the council tax.' Police discovered Green, left, owned the house after they raided a safety deposit box she had set up with her new boyfriend Scott Baker, right, in Oxford Street, Manchester . In mitigation defence counsel . Chris Daw said Statham was a 'vicious, violent psychopathic individual' who had taken control of Green's life when she was just 17. He denied Green had lived an 'extravagant lifestyle' on his crimes and said Statham had made her life a 'misery'. At Manchester Crown Court, Green of . Chadderton, Oldham, pleaded guilty to being concerned in an arrangement . which she knew facilitated the retention of criminal property. She was given six months jail suspended for two years. She . was also ordered to sell the mansion to pay . back £535,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act or face seven years jail. The house is currently worth £600,000. Today Det Con John Conroy of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Not only did Daniella Green have full knowledge of Statham's criminality, and not only did it provide her with a lavish lifestyle, she acquired this property knowing that it represented criminal property and indeed took it after his death. 'It is undeniably in the public interest for us to investigate people like Daniella Green as without them organised crime would not be able to flourish. 'This house may be made up of bricks and mortar, but it was built on the foundations of criminality; I hope it reassures the public that it will now need to be sold, and the money raised will be reinvested into our communities.' Baker, 39, a director of the Saddleworth Hotel in Delph, near Oldham pleaded guilty to theft and was sentenced to nine months imprisonment, suspended for two years.","Neighbours thought Daniella Green and David Statham were Lottery winners when he built it in 2003 .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela left hospital today after 'successful' medical tests and returned to his home in Johannesburg. The 94-year-old former president and anti-apartheid leader was admitted to a hospital in Pretoria, the capital, yesterday, to undergo tests 'in line with his age.' 'The doctors have completed the tests,' presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj said in a statement. 'He is well and as before, his health remains under the management of the medical team.' Maharaj appealed to the public and media to respect the privacy of Mandela and his family. The African National Congress, South Africa's ruling party, had earlier released a statement saying it believed Mandela was in 'capable and competent hands'. Routine: Nelson Mandela was admitted to hospital in Pretoria for . routine tests and there was said to be 'no cause for concern' Mr Mandela was hospitalised at the end of last year and he was airlifted on December 8 . from his rural village in the south of the country to a hospital in . Pretoria for a series of tests. Doctors found the former president . and hero of the anti-apartheid struggle had a recurrent lung infection . and had developed gallstones. He underwent surgery to remove the gallstones on December 15 and remained in hospital until December 26. At that time Mr Zuma had sought to calm jitters over Mr Mandela's health. 'I have been informed that at his age . doctors need to intervene in a very gradual and sensitive way in order . to maximise the chances of a full recovery,' he said. 'Madiba is an . unparalleled fighter and has always been so. He has met all his health . challenges with his tremendous fortitude and grace.' The Nobel peace laureate has a long . history of lung problems dating back decades to when he contracted . tuberculosis while in jail as a political prisoner. Smiling: Mr Mandela made a rare public appearance alongside his wife Graca Machel at Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium during the closing ceremony for the 2010 World Cup . He was previously admitted to hospital . for an acute respiratory infection in January 2011, when he was kept as . an inpatient for two nights. Under South Africa's white-minority . apartheid regime, Mandela spent 27 years in prison before he was . released in 1990. He became the nation's first democratically elected . president in 1994 under the banner of the African National Congress. He . served one five-year term before retiring. The anti-apartheid leader is . particularly susceptible to illness because of his age and his 27 years . in prison, though medics said he responded well to treatment. He fought off a similar lung infection in 2011 and once contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned. Medical experts have said that respiratory . illnesses like pneumonia striking a man his age are a serious matter . that require care and monitoring. His last hospitalisation . had caused concern in South Africa, a nation of 50 million . people that largely reveres him for being the nation's first . democratically elected president who sought to bring the country . together after centuries of racial division. Public concern: When Mandela was last hospitalised in December broadcast vans parked near the 1 Military Hospital eager for updates on his condition . Security: South African military police officers checked cars entering the 1 Military Hospital last year when Mr Mandela was hospitalised . In January 2011, Mr Mandela was . admitted to a Johannesburg hospital for what officials initially . described as tests but what turned out to be an acute respiratory . infection. The chaos that followed his stay at . that public hospital, with journalists and members of the public surrounding it . and entering wards, saw the South African military take charge of his . care and the government control the information about his health. The Nobel laureate last made a public appearance on a major stage when South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup football tournament. Although South Africa today struggles with poverty and inequality, Mandela is widely credited with helping to avert race-driven chaos as South Africa emerged from apartheid.

"By . Daniel Martin . Hospitals will no longer be able to profit simply by putting dying patients on the Liverpool Care Pathway. NHS trusts have been receiving six-figure sums for using the controversial end-of-life regime. But care minister Norman Lamb said these ‘bribes’ would have to stop unless it was shown suffering had been reduced. It is feared the incentives pressure doctors to use the pathway even when a patient’s life may not be nearing its end. Hospitals will no longer be able to reap financial bonuses by putting patients on the Liverpool Care Pathway, a scheme that governs the treatment of the seriously ill. File picture . Freedom of Information requests show Aintree University Hospitals Trust, in Liverpool, received £308,000 last year for achieving ‘goals including the Liverpool Care Pathway’. Part of the money was tied to it achieving an LCP figure of 43 per cent against a target of 35 per cent. Salford Royal NHS Trust had LCP-linked payments halved for failing to hit targets. Mr Lamb, who has commissioned a review of the pathway, said payments should be made only if it can be demonstrated that individual patients have experienced reduced suffering as a direct result of being placed on the LCP. ‘If incentives are given just to add someone to a list, that seems to be of concern,’ he said. ‘I want the issue of payments to be looked at in the review, but in the meantime, let’s ensure we only pay incentives when it can really be demonstrated that care at the end of life is being improved.’ Every year 130,000 people are placed on the pathway, which aims to ease suffering. It usually involves heavy sedation with morphine or similar drugs, and in some cases the removal of tubes providing nutrition and fluids. Yesterday Mr Lamb named health expert Julia Neuberger as chairman of the independent review. Her inquiry will make recommendations about any changes needed to ensure patients are always treated with dignity and that they and their families are involved in decision-making. It will look at the experience and . opinions of patients and families; the experience and opinions of health . professionals; complaints against hospitals; local payments made to . hospitals in respect of LCP; and the literature about the benefits and . limitations of the pathway. Baroness Neuberger, former chief executive of the King’s Fund health think-tank, used to sit in the Lords as a Lib Dem but is now a crossbencher and is also a senior rabbi to the West London Synagogue. She said: ‘How we care for people at the end of their lives is a reflection of our society’s values and civilisation. Mr Lamb called some aspects of the LCP, such as patients not getting food and drink, 'deeply disturbing' ‘At its best, Britain leads the world in end-of-life care, but it is not always perfect, and we need to work hard to get it right for everyone, providing the personal care individuals and their families both want and need.’ Mr Lamb said: ‘She will be scrupulously independent and she brings a faith perspective to the consideration of this. ‘She will be supported by a panel of people; independent experts and other people from faith perspectives. There is deep concern, for example, among the Roman Catholic perspective.’ The Lib Dem minister said there would be a specific session of the review which would question families about their experiences. Medical experts – both those for and against – would also appear. He said: ‘I have been deeply troubled by some of the stories that have been reported to me about the experiences in some hospitals. It is impossible to know the scale. ‘I am deeply concerned about the apparent misapplication of Liverpool Care Pathway guidelines in some hospitals. ‘Why it is that in many hospitals, patients are being denied food or drink, even though the guidelines say this should not happen? It is deeply disturbing and needs to be properly understood and investigated. ‘I will act on any rational conclusions that come from the review. We have the chance to get to a great conclusion, where we can genuinely improve the quality of care at the end of life. ‘It is critical that food and drink is not withdrawn, unless to give food and drink would cause unnecessary suffering. I have heard stories of people who are compos mentis being denied liquids – and this is deeply disturbing.’ One leading critic of the LCP, hospital consultant Professor Patrick Pullicino, attacked incentive payments last year. He said: ‘Given the fact that the diagnosis of impending death is such a subjective one, putting a financial incentive into the mix is really not a good idea.’","Some hospitals have received six-figure sums .

"By . Becky Evans . A Brazilian hospital doctor used 'fake fingers' made of silicon to record the attendance of fellow medics when they were not at work. Officers seized six 'fingers' from doctor Thauane Nunes Ferreira, 29, when they arrested her on Sunday following a tip-off. The ensuing scandal has led to investigations in Ferraz de Vasconcelos, near Sao Paulo, into the number of 'ghost workers' in the town. Scroll down for video . Digital deception: Nunes Ferreira used these 'fake fingers' made of silicon to sign in absent colleagues at work . The mayor Acir Fillo said as many as . 300 civil servants claimed their salary without going to work, according . to Brazilian website G1. He told a news conference: 'We have an army of ghosts.' He added: 'This case is a huge disappointment. Let's put cameras to monitor the clocks to not let that happen again.' Mr Fillo said they believe 'ghost workers' around found in public offices including health, security and education. Thauane Nunes Ferreira was arrested after signing colleagues into work at a hospital when they were not there by tricking a biometric scanner using 'fake fingers' made of silicon (file picture) Ferreira, who had been under surveillance, confessed to falsifying a public document after she was caught using the fingers to fool the biometric machine into recording colleague's attendance. Police arrested the doctor on Sunday following an anonymous tip-off . Medics at the Office of Mobile Emergency Care (Samu) have to sign in using their hands to record their attendance. Eleven doctors and 20 nurses are believed to be involved in the scam, reported The Telegraph. Ferreira told police that signing in absent colleagues was a condition of her employment and that the system was organised by Samu coordinator Jorge Cury. However he told the G1 website that he had been called by the health secretary and had to speak to police. He said: 'This is absurd! I've been a city official for 25 years and I've never known of this happening.' The Brazilian website reported that five doctors suspended after the arrest are still receiving their wages until an inquiry has concluded. The number of doctors at the hospital has now dropped from 15 to 10, meaning that shifts that used to have two doctors now have just one. Brazil's Health Ministry has started an audit of Samu and staff are working their way through documents to discover who was involved in the scam and how it worked. It is not yet clear whether the doctor used specific finger prints to trick the machine or how they were made.","Thauane Nunes Ferreira, 29, was arrested after being caught tricking the hospital scanner in Ferraz de Vasconcelos, near Sao Paulo, Brazil .

Mr Lobanov said he waited for hours in the cold before he spotted this owl. The pictures show the hungry owl hovering in the air when it first sees its prey before swooping on the unlucky rodent. The mouse tries to escape but is no match for the bird, which catches it in its talons and flies away with it. Mr Lobanov, 40, from Peresvet in Russia, said it was taking the photographs was a trial. He said: 'It was extremely difficult to get these shots. 'It was really very cold, about -32 degrees and of course I had to be very patient. 'I waited several hours to capture this moment and it's extremely difficult to get such a sharp sequence when everything is moving so quickly.'

"By . David Mccormack . Just hours after watching his wife - former ‘Melrose Place’ actress Amy Locane-Bovenizer - get three years in prison for killing a woman in a drunk-driving crash, Mark Bovenizer was involved in his own hit-and-run incident. Bovenizer, 41, is alleged to have driven his SUV across a lawn near his parent’s home in Hopewell Township, New Jersey, hitting a mailbox and causing $800 worth of property damage. Hopewell Borough resident Bovenizer then fled the scene without reporting the accident, officials said. Misses her family: Amy and her liquor store owner husband Mark Bovenizer have two daughters - seven-year-old Paige and five-year-old Avery . Police said they found Bovenizer's red 2008 Lexus RX 400h at a local repair shop with front-end damage matching the pieces of the vehicle found at the accident scene. Bovenizer was uncooperative with police and refused to provide a statement, according to the police report. He was not tested for drug or alcohol use. However Bovenizer’s alleged wrongdoing is nowhere near as serious as his wife’s conviction last November for the 2010 death of Manhattan resident Helene Seeman outside her home in Montgomery. Locane-Bovenizer's blood-alcohol level was three times the legal limit and she was traveling 18 mph above the posted 35 mph speed limit before the crash. Seeman’s husband, Fred, also was seriously injured. Minutes before the fatal accident, Locane-Bovenizer fled a minor fender-bender and was accused of running over a mailbox during her getaway. Locane-Bovenizer, 41, was sentenced the minimum three years in prison for second-degree vehicular homicide and third-degree assault by auto.

In the film, which is set to stirring music, North Korean troops are shown bombarding South Korea with rockets and bombs before scores of soldiers carrying the North Korean flag stream in, triumphantly.

He says: 'The crack stormtroops will occupy Seoul and other cities and take 150,000 US citizens as hostage.' Meanwhile US Navy ships in the region are destroyed, and 150,000 American troops and expats are taken hostage.

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . Haunting images of the exclusion zone around the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear plant reveal a land 'full of suffering and sorrow'. A Ukrainian photographer has spent five years documenting the exclusion zone that still surrounds the scene of the worst nuclear disaster in history - and the defiant residents who refused to leave. Arthur Bondar, who was just three-years-old when a catastrophic explosion at the power plant sent clouds of radiation into the atmosphere over Europe in April 1986, says he has been witnessing the consequences of the tragedy his entire life. Shadows of Wormwood: Photographer Arthur Bondar, who was three-years-old at the time of the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in 1986, has spent five years photographing the areas around the exclusion zone and the people that live there . 'I want to show the mystical aspects of this land, where every inch is full of suffering and sorrow,' said the photographer, who has said he embarked upon the series out of 'sympathy and respect' for the people who worked and lived in and around the exclusion zone. Soviet authorities evacuated 350,000 residents from the area around the plant amid the enormous battle to contain the contamination. But a small minority of people refused to leave, and recent years have seen older residents drawn back to the exclusion zone to live closer to family graves. The official Soviet death toll of 31 victims has been disputed, and the long-term impact of the radioactive fallout - from cancers to deformities - has still not fully come to light. They choose to remain in and around the zone despite the warnings of scientists who estimate the area - much of which has reverted to forest in the decades since the disaster - will not be safe to inhabit for another 20,000 years. Mr Bondar named his project Shadows of Wormwood, a reference to the Wormwood star mentioned in the Bible. A passage in the Book of Revelation describes a burning star that fell upon rivers, and reads: 'The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many died from the water, because it was made bitter.' See more of Arthur Bondar's work at www.arthurbondar.com. Consequences: The photographer, who is based in Kiev, Ukraine, has said that while he does not remember the night of the disaster 27 years ago, he has witnessed the consequences of the tragedy throughout his life . Tragedy: Radioactive particles released into the atmosphere after the explosion and fire at the nuclear power plant spread over much of Europe and what was then the western USSR . Tragedy: The fallout from the nuclear disaster was so dangerous Soviet authorities evacuated 350,000 residents, establishing an exclusion zone extending 19 miles out from the plant in all directions . Fenced-off: The area within the exclusion zone, which is still in place 27 years on from the disaster, is largely uninhabited but for a few residents who refused to leave, and it has reverted to forest in places . Abandoned: The rusted remains of a boat are seen among the bare branches of the trees within the exclusion zone that surrounds the abandoned Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine . Suffering: The photographer said he wanted to reflect the 'mystical aspects' of the land within the exclusion zone, where 'every inch is full of suffering and sorrow' Bleak outlook: Mr Bondar has criticised the decision to open the area around the Chernobyl exclusion zone to tourists, and claims those who continue to suffer as a result of the disaster are being forgotten . Living in no man's land: The area is sparsely populated by residents who refused to leave in the wake of the tragedy 27 years ago, and older people who have returned to the zone in recent years to be close to family graves . Surviving: The long-term effects of the catastrophe, which occurred when a systems test at the power plant near the city of Pripyat went disastrously wrong, are still being seen today . Desolate: The photographer said he was fascinated by the people living in and around the exclusion zone, and asked them whether they were afraid of radiation . Wormwood: The photographer named his project Shadows of Wormwood - a reference to the burning star in the Bible that fell upon rivers and made the water 'bitter' Contamination: Mr Bondar made several visits to the zone over a period of five years to capture the lasting effects of the disaster almost 30 years ago . Monochrome: Mr Bondar's photograph of the desolate area of Ukraine are all devoid of colour, but he has said the zone is 'more alive than people think' Accident: A systems test at the  power plant went disastrously wrong in 1986, triggering the worst nuclear disaster in history .

In a provocative new study, scientists have revealed that they were able to 'see' pain on brain scans and, for the first time, measure its intensity and tell whether a drug was relieving it. Though the research is in its early stages, it opens the door to a host of possibilities. Scans might be used someday to tell when pain is hurting a baby, someone with dementia or a paralyzed person unable to talk. Scroll down for video . Inside the brain: This image created by Tor Wager of the University of Colorado, Boulder shows the regions of the 'neurologic pain signature' Figures: Scientists have revealed that they were able to 'see' pain on brain scans and, for the first time, measure its intensity and tell whether a drug was relieving it . They might lead to new, less addictive pain medicines. They might even help verify claims for disability. 'Many people suffer from chronic pain and they're not always believed. We see this as a way to confirm or corroborate pain if there is a doubt,' said Tor Wager, a neuroscientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He led the research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. So far it is only on pain felt through the skin - heat applied to an arm. More study needs to be done on more common kinds of pain, such as headaches, bad backs and pain from disease. Independent experts say the research shows a way to measure objectively what is now one of life's most subjective experiences. Pain is the top reason people see a doctor, and there's no way to quantify how bad it is other than what they say. Hurt: The scans might be used someday to tell when pain is hurting a baby, someone with dementia or a paralyzed person unable to talk . A big quest in neuroscience is to find tests or scans that can help diagnose ailments with mental and physical components such as pain, depression and PTSD, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Although many studies have found brain areas that light up when pain is present, the new work is the first to develop a combined signature from all these signals that can be used to measure pain. Results: Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI scans, which don't require radiation as X-rays do, recorded changes in brain activity as measured by blood flow . 'This is very exciting work. They made a huge breakthrough in thinking about brain patterns,' said Dr David Shurtleff, acting deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which helped sponsor the research. 'We need a brain-based signature for pain. Self-report doesn't cut it. It's not reliable, it's not accurate.' The research involved four experiments at Columbia University approved by a panel to ensure no participants were harmed. In all, 114 healthy volunteers were paid $50 to $200 to be tested with a heating element placed against a forearm at various temperatures, not severe enough to cause burns or lasting damage. Some of the experiments required them to stand it for 10 to 20 seconds. 'It's like holding a hot cup of coffee that you really want to put down but can't quite yet,' Wager said. Functional . magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI scans, which don't require . radiation as X-rays do, recorded changes in brain activity as measured . by blood flow. Computers were used to generate signatures or patterns from these readings. Seeing pain: Activity in yellow-colored areas is predictive of higher levels of pain, and activity in blue-colored areas is predictive of lower levels of pain . The first set of experiments on 20 people developed signatures for pain versus the anticipation of it or mild warmth on the arm. The second experiment validated these signatures in 33 other people and found they predicted how much pain they said they felt. The results of a new study that measures and displays pain in a patient's brain is a new advancement in an area with a myriad of possibilities. Scans of this nature could one day be used to tell when pain is hurting a baby, someone with dementia or a paralyzed person unable to talk. Other possibilities include less addictive pain medications, and an accurate method to verify disability claims. Dr Tor Wager says that more examination is needed to determine how this study will impact other types of pain, including headaches, bad backs and from disease. 'It's really what seems to be a true measure of the experience that the patient's having,' and it gives a number to pain severity that can guide care, said one expert with no role in the studies, Dr Costantino Iadecola, director of the Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College. Researchers took their work a step further with the third experiment, which involved 40 people who recently lost a serious love relationship and were feeling intensely rejected. Besides the heat tests, they had scans while being shown a picture of their former partners and then a picture of a good friend. Researchers found the brain signatures for social or emotional pain were different from the ones for physical pain. 'That's very provocative,' said Dr Allan Ropper, a neurologist at Brigham and Women's and Harvard University who wrote a commentary in the journal. The signatures seem highly accurate and able to distinguish physical pain from other kinds, he said. In . the fourth experiment, researchers gave 21 participants two infusions . of a morphine-like drug while they were being scanned and having the . heat tests. Scanners: Researchers found the brain signatures for social or emotional pain were different from the ones for physical pain . The first time, they knew they were getting the drug. The second time they were told they were getting dummy infusions but in fact got the drug again. Brain signatures showed their pain was being relieved both times in proportion to how much drug was in their systems. 'This is beginning to open a new wedge into brain science,' Ropper said. 'There may be completely novel ways of treating pain by focusing on these areas of the brain rather than on conventional medications which block pain impulses from getting into the spinal cord and brain.' Shurtleff, of the federal drug abuse agency, also said he hoped the research would lead to newer drugs. 'We want medications that can reduce this signature and don't show a signature for addiction,' he said.","New type of brain scan allows scientists to 'see' and measure pain in terms of a subject's brain .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Tamara Cohen . David Cameron claimed it had been a 'good day' for his Europe policy after former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson dramatically called for Britain to leave the EU. The explosive intervention threatened to destroy Tory unity around the Prime Minister's pledge to hold an in-out referendum if he wins the 2015 general election. But Mr Cameron brushed aside fears the issue could hijack his next two years in power, insisting only he was willing to give voters a say on severing ties with Brussels. David Cameron, pictured today, insisted it had been a 'good day' for his referendum pledge . Lord Lawson of Blaby, 81, described . the EU as ‘a bureaucratic monstrosity’ and said leaving ‘would . substantially outweigh the costs’. 'The case for exit is clear,' he . said. Margaret Thatcher’s longest-serving Chancellor pledged . to vote No in any referendum . on membership, in a move that piles further pressure on Mr Cameron, . emboldening Tory Eurosceptics and threatening the stability of the . coalition. But Mr Cameron played down the threat to his position. He told a press conference: 'I think it has been a good day for the pledge that I have made that, if re-elected, I will hold an in/out referendum so that everybody can have not just a voice about Britain's future in Europe but also have a vote about Britain's future in Europe. 'I welcome the attention that has been placed on this key pledge that I have made. Only a Conservative Government, only the Conservatives of the major parties, are making this promise. 'I want to give people a choice not between the status quo and leaving the EU. I want to give people a choice between Britain remaining in a reformed EU or leaving that EU. That is the choice that people want and there is only one way to get it and that is by supporting the Conservatives at the next election.' 'Bureaucratic monstrosity': Lord Lawson says the EU has served its purpose and Britain should now withdraw . The Prime Minister will use this week's Queen's Speech to react to the rise of the UK Independence Party, which won more than 140 council seats in last week's local elections. He had hoped the promise to renegotiate a new deal with Brussels, followed by a referendum by 2017, would placate Eurosceptics in his party. Mr Cameron would campaign to stay in the EU. But Lord Lawson ridiculed the plan as 'inconsequential', with Britain 'consistently outvoted' by countries in the Eurozone. He said the nature of the EU had 'fundamentally change' since the creation of the single currency. 'That is why, while I voted “in” in 1975, I shall be voting “out” in 2017,' he wrote in The Times. While there would be ‘some economic cost’ from leaving the EU single . market, Lord Lawson went on, ‘in my judgment the economic gains would . substantially outweigh the costs.’ He called the EU ‘an institution that has achieved its historic purpose . and is now past its sell-by date’ and said British industry should focus . on the developing world. Mr Cameron is resisting pressure to hold a referendum next spring in . which voters would be asked if they supported a looser relationship with . Brussels. In January David Cameron set out his detailed timetable for staging a historic referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. He received plaudits in January when he promised that if he is still Prime Minister after the 2015 general election, he would seek a 'fresh settlement' with the EU before putting it to the people in a referendum. But he made clear that he thought Britain was better off in the EU. Lord Lawson likened the idea of renegotiating terms with Brussels to similar talks held by Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson 40 years ago. 'The changes that Wilson was able to negotiate were so trivial that I doubt if anyone today can remember what they were. But he was able to secure a 2-1 majority for the “in” vote in the 1975 referendum. 'I have no doubt that any changes that Mr Cameron — or, for that matter, Ed Miliband — is able to secure will be equally inconsequential'. In recent weeks the rise of UKIP has . startled the political establishment, culminating in dramatic gains in . last week's council elections in which Mr Farage's party took almost one . in four votes. Today Mr . Farage seized on Lord Lawson's article, saying it 'legitimises the UKIP . position and exposes serious divisions in the Tory Party'. But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . said Tory policy on Europe should not be shaped by a knee-jerk response . to the threat posed by UKIP. 'I . know the Conservatives are struggling to work out how to deal with UKIP . and they keep now changing their minds: one minute they want to be in . the European Union, now senior Conservatives like Nigel Lawson say they . want to go out,' he told ITV's Daybreak. 'I . think we need to transform the European Union to make it more . transparent more efficient, more democratic where we can, but not turn . our backs on it because doing so would make us less safe and less . prosperous.' UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Lord Lawson's . intervention 'legitimises' his own calls for exit from the EU while Lib . Dem leader Nick Clegg said the Tories were 'struggling' to cope with the . rise of UKIP . Mr Clegg warned that leaving the EU 'would jeopardise up to three million jobs in this country'. Senior Tory backbenchers want Mr . Cameron to deliver on his hint last week that he could bring forward . legislation on staging a referendum before 2015. British must do more to understand Europe, a senior Brussels commissioner has suggested. Trade commissioner Karel de Gucht said UK politicians did not need to 'love' the EU, but needed to get to know it better. 'It’s really amazing how little a lot of British politicians know about Europe,' he told The Independent. 'You need decision on the basis of facts and figures and arguments, not on the basis of myths. Why don’t people tell the truth about the EU. 'They should get better acquainted with it. We don’t want you to love Europe, love should be kept for personal relationships. But look at your own interests and ‘de-dramatise’ all this.' He warned British leaders against a 'blame game' with Brussels for the UK's problems. The Prime Minister said: ‘I think we need to demonstrate absolutely that we are serious about this referendum. ‘Anything we can to do to strengthen that offer I am prepared to consider.’ But without the support of Lib Dems in a Commons vote, it is almost certain to be defeated. Former Tory minister Sir Gerald Howarth said Mr Cameron faces a 'big challenge'. 'If those changes that he can secure are ‘inconsequential’, in the words of Lord Lawson, then clearly that will leave us with only one option, which is to leave,' he told BBC Radio 4. 'And I think the challenge for our European partners - that’s actually a rather bigger challenge for them than it is for us - is to come up with some substantial changes that will meet the aspirations of the British people who are becoming increasingly more eurosceptic.' A . Downing Street spokesman said: 'The PM has always been clear: we need a . Europe that is more open, more competitive, and more flexible; a Europe . that wakes up to the modern world of competition. In short, Europe has . to reform. 'But . our continued membership must have the consent of the British people, . which is why the PM has set out a clear timetable on this issue.' Both Labour and the Lib Dems are opposed to Mr Cameron's idea of a referendum, arguing it would create uncertainty and risk jobs. But Labour leader Ed Miliband is under pressure from senior backbenchers to back the idea of giving voters a say. Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee, said on Twitter: 'An in/out referendum before the next election would clear the air. We could actually hold it on the day of the next general election.' It comes as one of the euro’s most prominent cheerleaders has called for . the single currency to be scrapped. Senior Labour MP Keith Vaz backed the idea of an early referendum to 'clear the air' Rethink: Oskar Lafontaine, who was Germany's finance minister when the euro was adopted has called for the currency to be broken up so that southern Europe can recover from economic crisis . Former German finance minister . Oskar Lafontaine warned the current course is ‘leading to disaster’ and . the ‘situation is worsening from month to month’. He said crisis-hit countries in southern Europe, including France, will . be ‘forced by their current misery to fight back against German hegemony . sooner or later’. It marks a stunning U-turn for the Left-wing . politician, Germany’s finance minister when the euro was launched in . 1999. Critics labelled him Europe’s most dangerous man after he called for the . ‘end of the nation state’ in favour of a ‘united Europe’ in 1998. But . the euro crisis has caused Mr Lafontaine to change his tune. Awakening: Mr Lafontaine said that German Chancellor Angela Merkel would 'awake from her self-righteous slumber' once troubled eurozone countries forced through a change in policy at Germany's expense . The 69-year-old former minister says the single currency must be broken . up to allow bailed-out countries, including Greece, Portugal, Spain and . Cyprus, to recover. He said: ‘The economic situation is worsening from month to month and . unemployment has reached a level that puts democratic structures ever . more in doubt.’ He added that Chancellor Angela Merkel ‘will awake from her . self-righteous slumber’ when the troubled countries unite, forcing . policy changes at Germany’s expense. In a final admission that the single currency had failed, Mr Lafontaine . said: ‘Hopes that the creation of the euro would force rational economic . behaviour on all sides were in vain.’","Lord Lawson says benefits of exit outweigh 'marginal' costs .

"By . David Mccormack . An 80-year-old Florida woman accidentally swallowed a $5,000 diamond that had been placed in her glass of champagne at an charity event. Miriam Tucker was attending the event organized by the Tampa Women's Club last weekend. As a surprise for the attendees, the organizers filled each of the 400 flutes of champagne with a cubic zirconia, except for one which contained a $5,000 diamond donated by a local jeweler. Whoops: Miriam Tucker swallowed the diamond which was in a glass of champagne . The $5,000 diamond had been donated by a local jeweler to be a prize at the charity event organized by the Tampa Women's Club last weekend . The idea was that at the end of the evening everyone’s glass would be checked and whoever had the diamond would be allowed to keep it. But disaster struck after Miriam unwittingly swallowed everything that was in her flute. 'We were laughing and talking when I realized I swallowed it. What a dumb thing,' the retired realtor told the Miami Herald. To begin with Miriam hid her embarrassment about what she had done, hopeful that someone else would be found to have the diamond and announced the winner. Eventually Miriam was forced to came forward and admit what she had done. Immediately she was taken to a local hospital for an x-ray, only to find out that diamonds don't show up on x-rays. Fortunately . for Miriam she had a routine colonoscopy booked for the next day which turned out to be anything but routine. She gave her doctor . strict instructions to be on the lookout for something sparkling. The organizers filled each of the 400 flutes of champagne with a cubic zirconia, except for one which contained a $5,000 diamond . A doctor spotted the diamond while carrying out a routine colonoscopy on the woman . Her doctor found the elusive diamond, but Miriam still had to check out if it was the winning jewel, so Miriam stopped by the jewelry store to have the diamond tested. 'She came with it in a bio-hazard bag . and it wasn't even cleaned,' said Joy Pierson, a partner at Continental . Wholesale Diamond which had donated the precious stone. Once the diamond was washed and steamed it was tested and confirmed as the winning diamond, which Miriam has decided to keep as a family heirloom.","Miriam Tucker, 80, unwittingly swallowed the diamond which was in her glass of champagne at a charity event .

"By . James Rush . and Will Stewart In Moscow . Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky drew up a new will nine days before his death, but not one of the five potential executors have been willing to take up the job of administering his estate. A firm of accountants has been appointed by the court to act as receivers, although it is believed it could take them months or even years to work their way through the chaotic estate. The 67-year-old was buried in a Surrey cemetery today surrounded by his two ex-wives and several mistresses. Boris Berezovsky's funeral was held today at Brookwood Cemetery, in Woking, Surrey . Mr Berezovsky drew up a new will nine days before his death in March, but not one of the five potential executors have been willing to take on the job . The 67-year-old (pictured outside the High Court in August last year) was found lying on the floor of his bathroom at his home in Ascot, Berkshire, on March 23 . Mr Berezovsky was once a leading . Kremlin powerbroker but later fled into exile as a sworn enemy of . strongman president Vladimir Putin. A bodyguard discovered him dead in the bathroom of ex-wife Galina's home near Ascot on March 23. A post-mortem found his death was consistent with hanging but a police investigation remains underway. Russia has denied its secret services . targeted Berezovsky but Putin said last that he could not 'rule out' Western intelligence playing a role, though he said he had no such . evidence. The private ceremony was at Brookwood . Cemetery, the largest in Britain. Its timing changed several times to . avoid interest from the Russian media. Reports in Moscow said ex-wives Nina Korotkova and Galina Besharova were present plus long-time partner Yelena Gorbunova. Lover Katerina Sabirova was seen at . the graveside, said Russian news website Life News, which carried . 'exclusive' pictures from the cemetery. Mr Berezovsky's funeral was due to be held on Monday but had to be postponed until today . Sources have said it could take years to unravel his complex estate . Also among the mourners were the tycoon's six children, it is believed. Close friend Chechen politician . Akhmed Zakayev, exiled to Britain and wanted in Russia on alleged . terrorism offences, was seen at the graveside. A ceremony at a Greek Orthodox Church preceded the burial, it is understood. Berezovsky's relatives and friends have disputed that he took his own life. A firm of accountants has been appointed by the court to act as receivers, although it is believed it could take them months or even years to work its way through the estate . The . Times has now reported that lawyers, family members and creditors are . attempting to work out what Mr Berezovsky has left behind. Insiders have told the paper his complex estate could take years to unravel. According . to The Times, two private lawyers, friend Yuli Dubov, his daughter . Ekaterina Berezovskaya and Helena Gorbunova, his estranged long-time . partner, have been named as executors. Mr Berezovsky last year lost a multibillion-pound High Court battle with Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich (pictured) International accountants Grant Thornton have been appointed as interim receivers until an executor is formally appointed. Partner at the firm Kevin Hellard has said they intended to submit an initial report to the court within the next month. However, it is not known whether there is anything left in his assets. One source told The Times: 'He had nothing at all left, nothing. He couldn't even pay for lunch.' The oligarch, who last year lost a multibillion-pound High Court battle with Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, could have run up more than £100 million in legal bills since 2011. In July 2011, he paid out Britain's biggest-ever divorce settlement to his ex-wife, Galina Besharova. Reports suggested the deal was worth more than £100 million. He later built up fees totalling more than £250,000 after becoming embroiled in a case at the High Court with his former partner, Elena Gorbunova, who sat at his side throughout much of his battle with Mr Abramovich. But one source told The Times a settlement from a legal dispute with the family of a former business partner would have left him a wealthy man. Mr Berezovsky fell out with Russian President Vladimir Putin and often feared for his life - prompting speculation in Britain and Russia over the manner of his death. Even though police said they have found no evidence that anyone else was involved, it has not stopped widespread speculation.","Funeral for 67-year-old was held today at Brookwood Cemetery, in Woking .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Pope Francis admitted he has fallen asleep during his bedtime prayer . Pope Francis has admitted nodding off while praying at the end of a long day, but said he thought God ‘understands’. The pontiff was appearing before 200,000 people gathered in St Peter’s Square when he made unscripted comments on subjects ranging from memories of his grandmother, his decision to become a priest and political corruption. To laughter from the crowd, he described how he prays each day before an altar before going to bed. 'Sometimes I doze off, the fatigue of the day makes you fall asleep, but he (God) understands,' he said. Calling . on Catholics to do more to help the poor and needy in society he went . on: 'If we step outside of ourselves, we will find poverty. 'Today, it breaks my heart to say it, finding a homeless person who has died of cold, is not news. 'Today, the news is scandals, that is . news, but the many children who don’t have food - that’s not news. 'This . is grave. We can’t rest easy while things are this way.' The crowd, most of whom are already involved in charity work, interrupted him often with applause. 'We cannot become starched Christians, too polite, who speak of theology calmly over tea. 'We have to become courageous Christians and seek out those (who need help most),' he said. Francis, the former Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, said the world was going through not just an economic crisis but a crisis of values. 'This is happening today. If investments in banks fall, it is a tragedy and people say ""What are we going to do?""'. 'But if people die of hunger, have nothing to eat or suffer from poor health, that’s nothing. This is our crisis today. A Church that is poor and for the poor has to fight this mentality.’ The Pontiff told a crowd of 200,000 people about his moment of shuteye, but said he thought God understands that it's hard to stay awake after a tiring day . Pope Francis delivered an off the cuff speech. Today, he celebrated Pentecost mass in St. Peter's Square . He was speaking after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss Europe’s economic crisis. Apparently . responding to his criticism of a heartless 'dictatorship of the . economy' earlier in the week, Merkel, who is up for re-election in . September, later called for stronger regulation of financial markets. On . Thursday, Francis appealed in a speech for world financial reform, . saying the global economic crisis had made life worse for millions in . rich and poor countries.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The Associated Press has accused the Justice Department of a 'massive and unprecedented intrusion' after it secretly obtained two months worth of reporters' telephone records, potentially identifying confidential sources. The records listed journalists' incoming and outgoing calls, as well as the duration of each call, for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters, general AP office numbers in New York, Washington and Hartford, Connecticut, and the main number for AP reporters in the House of Representatives press gallery, according to attorneys for the AP. In all, the government seized records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April and May of 2012. The government would not say why it sought the records. News of the probe into one of the largest news organizations in the world immediately sparked outrage among Republicans on Capitol Hill. 'The First Amendment is first for a reason,' Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, told MailOnline. 'If the Obama Administration is going after reporters’ phone records, they better have a damned good explanation.' Justice: The Associated Press has accused the Justice Department of a 'massive and unprecedented intrusion' after it secretly obtained two months worth of reporters' telephone records, potentially identifying confidential sources . A spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Republican in Virginia, said the move is representative of a broader 'pattern of intimidation.' 'Whether it is secretly targeting . patriotic Americans participating in the electoral progress or reporters . exercising their First Amendment rights, these new revelations suggest a . pattern of intimidation by the Obama Administration,' Doug Heye said. The American Civil Liberties Union was equally critical. 'Obtaining a broad range of telephone records in order to ferret out a government leaker is an unacceptable abuse of power,' said Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. 'Freedom of the press is a pillar of our democracy, and that freedom often depends on confidential communications between reporters and their sources.' White House spokesman Jay Carney initially declined a request for comment on this story and referred all further inquiries to the Justice Department. A couple hours later he released a statement saying, 'Other than press reports, we have no knowledge of any attempt by the Justice Department to seek phone records of the AP. We are not involved in decisions made in connection with criminal investigations, as those matters are handled independently by the Justice Department.' 'Any questions about an ongoing criminal investigation should be directed to the Department of Justice,' the statement added. AP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt said the government obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any . specific investigation. He demanded the return of the phone records and . destruction of all copies. 'There can be no possible . justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone . communications of The Associated Press and its reporters,' Pruitt wrote in a letter of protest to Attorney General Eric Holder. 'These . records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources . across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a . two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations, . and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the . government has no conceivable right to know.' The exact number of journalists who . used the phone lines during that period is unknown but more than 100 . journalists work in the offices whose phone records were targeted on a . wide array of stories about government and other matters. U.S. officials have previously said in public testimony that the U.S. attorney in Washington is conducting a criminal investigation into who may have leaked information contained in a May 7, 2012, AP story about a foiled terror plot. Outraged: AP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt, pictured, said the government sought and obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation . The story disclosed details of a CIA operation in Yemen that stopped an al-Qaida plot in the spring of 2012 to detonate a bomb on an airplane bound for the United States. In testimony in February, CIA Director John Brennan noted that the FBI had questioned him about whether he was AP's source, which he denied. He called the release of the information to the media about the terror plot an 'unauthorized and dangerous disclosure of classified information.' Prosecutors have sought phone records from reporters before, but the seizure of records from such a wide array of AP offices, including general AP switchboards numbers and an office-wide shared fax line, is unusual and largely unprecedented. In the letter notifying the AP received Friday, the Justice Department offered no explanation for the seizure, according to Pruitt's letter and attorneys for the AP. The records were presumably obtained from phone companies earlier this year although the government letter did not explain that. None of the information provided by the government to the AP suggested the actual phone conversations were monitored. The Justice Department released a statement on Monday defending its actions. 'We take seriously our obligations to follow all applicable laws, federal regulations, and Department of Justice policies when issuing subpoenas for phone records of media organizations,' the statement reads. 'Those regulations require us to make every reasonable effort to obtain information through alternative means before even considering a subpoena for the phone records of a member of the media.' 'Because we value the freedom of the press, we are always careful and deliberative in seeking to strike the right balance between the public interest in the free flow of information and the public interest in the fair and effective administration of our criminal laws.' Among those whose phone numbers were obtained were five reporters and an editor who were involved in the May 7, 2012 story. The Obama administration has aggressively investigated disclosures of classified information to the media and has brought six cases against people suspected of leaking classified information, more than under all previous presidents combined. Justice Department published rules require that subpoenas of records from news organizations must be personally approved by the attorney general but it was not known if that happened in this case. The letter notifying AP that its phone records had been obtained though subpoenas was sent Friday by Ronald Machen, the U.S. attorney in Washington. Spokesmen in Machen's office and at the Justice Department had no immediate comment on Monday. Records: In all, the government seized records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April and May of 2012. The government would not say why it sought the records (stock photo) The Justice Department lays out strict rules for efforts to get phone records from news organizations. A subpoena can only be considered after 'all reasonable attempts' have been made to get the same information from other sources, the rules say. It was unclear what other steps, in total, the Justice Department has taken to get information in the case. A subpoena to the media must be 'as narrowly drawn as possible' and 'should be directed at relevant information regarding a limited subject matter and should cover a reasonably limited time period,' according to the rules. The reason for these constraints, the department says, is to avoid actions that 'might impair the news gathering function' because the government recognizes that 'freedom of the press can be no broader than the freedom of reporters to investigate and report the news.' News organizations normally are notified in advance that the government wants phone records and enter into negotiations over the desired information. In this case, however, the government, in its letter to the AP, cited an exemption to those rules that holds that prior notification can be waived if such notice, in the exemption's wording, might 'pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation.' Intrusion: The AP has sent a letter of protest to Attorney General Eric Holder, pictured . It is unknown whether a judge or a grand jury signed off on the subpoenas. The May 7, 2012, AP story that disclosed details of the CIA operation in Yemen to stop an airliner bomb plot occurred around the one-year anniversary of the May 2, 2011, killing of Osama bin Laden. The plot was significant because the White House had told the public it had 'no credible information that terrorist organizations, including al-Qaida, are plotting attacks in the U.S. to coincide with the (May 2) anniversary of bin Laden's death.' The AP delayed reporting the story at the request of government officials who said it would jeopardize national security. Once government officials said those concerns were allayed, the AP disclosed the plot because officials said it no longer endangered national security. The Obama administration, however, continued to request that the story be held until the administration could make an official announcement. The May 7 story was written by reporters Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman with contributions from reporters Kimberly Dozier, Eileen Sullivan and Alan Fram. They and their editor, Ted Bridis, were among the journalists whose April-May 2012 phone records were seized by the government. Brennan talked about the AP story and leaks investigation in written testimony to the Senate. 'The irresponsible and damaging leak of classified information was made ... when someone informed the Associated Press that the U.S. Government had intercepted an IED (improvised explosive device) that was supposed to be used in an attack and that the U.S. Government currently had that IED in its possession and was analyzing it,' he said. He also defended the White House's plan to discuss the plot immediately afterward. 'Once someone leaked information about interdiction of the IED and that the IED was actually in our possession, it was imperative to inform the American people consistent with Government policy that there was never any danger to the American people associated with this al-Qa'ida plot,' Brennan told senators.","Department allegedly obtained records listing incoming and outgoing calls and duration of calls for more than 20 telephone lines used by journalists .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . The head of the FBI has admitted that the agency uses drones in the U.S. to spy on citizens. FBI director Robert Mueller told congress the agency owns several drones but has not yet formed policies or guidelines on their use. Confirmation that the U.S. is using the surveillance equipment to monitor its own citizens comes after the NSA phone tracking scandal rocked trust in the government. Scroll down for video . Spy plane: FBI director Robert Mueller confirms the U.S. uses drones for surveillance of its own citizens . The confirmation of their use came in response to a question from Iowa senator Chuck Grassley before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. Mr Mueller added the drones were 'very seldom used and generally used in a particular incident where you need the capability.' Although the FBI uses drones on domestic soil, it has yet to set down guidelines on the appropriate circumstances for their use. 'We are in the early stages of doing that, and I will tell you that our footprint is very small, we have very few, and have limited use. And we're exploring not only the use, but the necessary guidelines for that use,' he added. 'There are a number of issues related to drones that will need to be debated in the future,it’s still in its nascent stages, this debate.' The use of drones over U.S. soil is well known, according to NBC Politics. They are used to help police working along the Mexico border. The Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms also have the use of drone technology to help in cases. Keeping watch: Unarmed drones are used on a seldom basis in the U.S. FBI director Robert Mueller says . When the Republican Senator Rand Paul challenged President Obama's use of drones in pursuing terrorist suspects in March, he won an affirmation that it would be illegal for the government to use a drone strike against a U.S. citizen on American soil. He later clarified his views on drones, according to the Huffington Post: saying: 'If someone comes out of a liquor store with a weapon and $50 in cash, I don't care if a drone kills him or a policeman kills him. But it's different if they want to come fly over your hot tub or your yard just because they want to do surveillance on everyone, and they want to watch your activities.' The Federal Aviation Administration estimates there may be about 10,000 active commercial drones in five years, according to Bloomberg. At least 18 states have introduced bills to regulate the use of the surveillance aircraft. On Wednesday, Mr Mueller also used his appearance to defend the National Security Agency's collection of phone and internet records and resist calls for greater transparency. 'There is a price to be paid for that transparency. I certainly think it would be educating our adversaries as to what our capabilities are,' he said. Mr Mueller, who is due to retire at the end of the year, said the FBI would . continue to weigh up the possibility of publishing more information about . its surveillance projects, and warned that doing so would be to the advantage of . America’s enemies. Defense: Robert Mueller defended the NSA's collection of phone records and said Edward Snowden's actions had harmed the nation's security . 'If we're going to prevent terrorist attacks, we have to be on their communications,' Mr Mueller said. 'Having the ability to identify a person in the United States, one telephone number with a telephone that the intelligence community is on in Yemen or Somalia or Pakistan ... may prevent that one attack, that Boston or that 9/11.' He added: 'You never know which dot will be critical. You need as many as you can get. Let there be no mistake, there would be fewer dots to connect if you don't have a data base that retains those records.' When the committee's chairman Patrick Leahy asked how critical phone records had been to the FBI's work, Mr Mueller said: 'For most occasions it has been a contributing factor ... but there are those cases where it has been instrumental.' The FBI director also commented on the prosecution of Edward Snowden,over the NSA monitoring leak. 'These disclosures have caused significant harm to our nation and to our safety, and we are taking all necessary steps to hold accountable that person for these disclosures,' he said.","Robert Mueller says agency uses drones on very few occasions .

"By . Nick Fagge In Praia Da Luz . Still alive? Madeleine McCann disappeared aged three in Portugal . Portugal's top lawyer yesterday poured scorn on Scotland Yard’s investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Attorney General Joana Marques Vidal said officers from London had no right to operate in Portugal and cannot question, interview or arrest anyone. Her comments are in stark contrast to the Metropolitan Police’s upbeat announcement on Thursday of ‘genuinely new’ leads in the six-year-old case and that arrests could be made within weeks. Detectives say they are preparing to swoop on 38 suspects – including 12 Britons – in Portugal and other parts of Europe. Scotland Yard says it has asked the Crown Prosecution Service to submit an International Letter of Request to enable a team of officers to pursue inquiries in Portugal. But Mrs Marques Vidal said she has received no British request for mutual legal assistance in an inquiry into the disappearance of Madeleine – meaning the Met has no right to pursue inquiries. Her spokesman said: ‘We have not received any request for mutual assistance with regard to the Madeleine McCann case. He added that even if British police are allowed to travel to Portugal to ‘help the sovereign authorities’ carry out the ‘request for mutual assistance’, Met officers ‘cannot conduct any interviews or any other action in Portugal’. Anguish: Kate McCann, Madeleine's mother, holding a picture of her daughter in 2010 in one of her many appeals for information . Meanwhile Portugal’s detective unit, the Policia Judiciaria, said its officers would assist the British inquiry, but added they would effectively work to rule – only carrying out their duties to the letter of the law. Pedro do Carmo, deputy national director of the unit, told the Daily Mail: ‘We are available to co-operate with the British authorities but only under terms of Portuguese law and within the time period allowed under Portuguese law.’ Portuguese detectives have condemned any deal between London and Lisbon as ‘political b*******’. One said: ‘British police may be allowed to sit in on the interviews, with the prosecutor’s agreement, but they must not interfere or ask questions themselves. And if this deal does exist politics should not be allowed to interfere with justice. That is b*******.’ Ongoing battle: Kate and Gerry McCann marking the fourth anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance . Three-year-old Madeleine vanished from an apartment in the resort of Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007, while her parents, Kate and Gerry, were having dinner at a restaurant nearby with friends. The shambolic inquiry into her whereabouts was shelved in 2008 and Portuguese authorities have refused to re-open the case, saying there is no new evidence. Scotland Yard began their own Home Office-funded review in  2011, going over files compiled by the Portuguese authorities and private detectives hired by Mr and Mrs McCann. Met Police teams have travelled to Portugal 16 times to share their findings with Portuguese detectives, and lawyers from the CPS visited Lisbon last month to discuss the case. On the case: Scotland Yard has launched its own inquiry . Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the inquiry, has said he believes there is a possibility that Madeleine is alive. David Cameron yesterday welcomed the announcement that the Met had launched their own inquiry. He said: ‘It is welcome because they say that there is new evidence, new leads to follow, new things to be done. ‘It was a case that did shock and still shocks the nation and if an answer can be found we should try to find it.’","Met Police made upbeat announcement about new leads on Thursday .

"By . Anna Edwards . Braintree District Council took chicken farmer Anthony Block to court after one of the residents neighbouring the farm made a complaint . A magistrate has laughed a council out of court after they hauled a rural farmer to the dock for failing to stop his chickens crowing too loudly. Anthony Block, 52, laughed when he first heard Braintree District Council's plan to drag him in front of magistrates over his free range chicken farm near Finchingfield, Essex. Mr Block is accused of falling fowl of a noise abatement order he received three years ago calling on him to prevent his chickens ‘crowing at a level likely to result in reasonable cause for complaint from occupiers of nearby residential properties'. But despite baffled magistrates refusing to enforce a fine, Mr Block has still been left with £115 legal costs and a criminal record following the barmy conviction. He said: 'What next? Are they going to complain about the birds in the trees being too noisy? 'My business has been here since 2002 and all of a sudden they are too noisy - it just doesn't make any sense. 'The magistrates laughed the case out of court as they thought it was a waste of time and money so I don't understand why the council were allowed to take it this far. 'I thought it was a joke when the council first phoned me up about a complaint from a neighbour about my chickens being too loud - it's absolute madness that I now have a conviction for it.' Mr Block claims he was 'bullied' into pleading guilty to failing to comply with the noise abatement notice after council officials threatened to involve costly lawyers and charge him for the legal bills. Mr Block claims he was 'bullied' into pleading guilty to failing to comply with the noise abatement notice . He added: 'The council have been totally against me the whole way. They threatened to get a barrister in and charge me for costs. 'I was worried it was going to end up costing me thousands so I felt bullied into accepting the charge.' Mr Block appeared in the dock charged with breaching a noise abatement notice - despite the council admitting no decibel readings were ever taken. Instead the charge was brought merely on the basis of a council officer's ‘professional opinion' following a visit to the farm. The life-long farmer was handed a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £115 legal costs at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court last week. The life-long farmer was handed a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £115 legal costs at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court . Chairman of the bench Michael Rothon said: 'I am not sure it's written down anywhere how many decibels a cockerel is allowed to make. 'It's a farm with chickens so you expect to hear noise. 'We're giving you a conditional discharge as we really don't want to waste any more time on it.' The neighbour who made the complaint against Mr Block declined to comment when approached for an interview. Wendy Schmitt, a Braintree district councillor, defended the court action saying: 'Although this is quite an unusual case, it is clear that the noise caused by the animals was excessive, often taking place over night, and as such action was required. 'Excessive noise either from a residential or commercial property can make people's lives a misery and in this case despite having a large . plot of land, the cockerels were being housed in a way that was causing upset for neighbours. 'The council will always look to act when appropriate to do so.'","Anthony Block was charged with breaching a noise abatement notice .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Half a million more immigrants arrived in Britain from the European Union than was previously believed, campaigners have warned. It means immigration between mid-1997 and mid-2010, while Labour was in power, now totals nearly 4million, rather than the 3.4million recorded. The number of people who went under the radar would have filled a city the size of Manchester. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) discovered the mistake in May when they compared the results of the 2011 census with the population that they had expected to find on the basis of births, deaths and official immigration figures, Migrationwatch UK said. The number of people arriving in Britain of the EU was undercounted by half a million (file picture) The campaign group has written to the UK Statistics Authority watchdog to insist the ONS revises the official immigration numbers for the period - something the group claims it has refused to do. Migrationwatch UK chair Sir Andrew Green said: 'Four million immigrants in 13 years is an astonishing figure - the highest in our history, including the Norman Conquest in 1066. 'This new information underlines the scale of the task faced by the present government in getting the numbers down.' He added: 'There is no point in burying bad news in obscure documents. That simply destroys trust. It is hard to think of a set of statistics that is more important to the public. 'For the sake of public confidence in government statistics there must be a thorough revision of the immigration statistics and the new figures must be published without delay.' Migrationwatch UK added that allowing for the one million British citizens who emigrated in the period between 1997 and 2010, net immigration comes to three million. The revelations come as Britain prepares for access restrictions to its labour market to be lifted for Romanians and Bulgarians at the end of the year. The UK Government has so far refused to provide official estimates as ministers believe they would not be reliable. Campaigners say immigration over 13 years to 2010 is the highest in British history at nearly four million . But campaigners such as Migrationwatch UK have warned that up to 250,000 Romanians and Bulgarians could arrive in the first five years after the restrictions are lifted on January 1, 2014. In a letter to UK Statistics Authority chairman Sir Andrew Dilnot, Sir Andrew said the 'significance of the error underlines the scale of the task now facing the present government'. He added: 'It is hard to think of a statistical series that is more sensitive in terms of public opinion, particularly at present.' A statement from the UK Statistics Authority said: 'The UK Statistics Authority received a letter from Sir Andrew Green dated 8 July regarding long-term migration statistics. The authority is looking at the points raised and will respond publicly in due course.' Paul Vickers, head of population outputs at ONS, said: 'It is simply not true to suggest that ONS has ""refused"" to revise migration estimates. 'ONS produced a revised population estimates series which incorporates the net migration findings from the 2011 Census. 'The series, going back to 2002, was published in December 2012. 'At the same time we announced plans to publish a report analysing the quality of the long-term international migration data since 2001, including impacts of the improvements made to the data since this period. This will be published in the autumn.'","Office of National Statistics noticed error in May when comparing figures .

"By . Ian Gallagher . and Claudia Joseph . Public pregnancy: The Duchess of Cambridge is not short of advice as 1,000 people gave their opinions on how she should raise her baby . The Duchess of Cambridge should be a stay-at-home mother and not rely on a nanny to help bring up her baby, according to an exclusive poll for The Mail on Sunday. Since their marriage, Prince William and Kate have been at the forefront of a rejuvenation of the Royal Family, often showing an unwillingness to stick to tradition. Princess Diana had a nanny to look after both William and his brother Harry. The Survation poll of 1,000 people found that more than half supported the couple’s plan to bring up their baby themselves. Nearly six out of ten believe Kate should ‘significantly’ cut back her Royal duties, though she is thought likely to return to work in some capacity by the autumn. Amid speculation that William will quit his job as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot, three-quarters of those surveyed said he should continue. But the suggestion that Kate’s parents, Mike and Carole Middleton, should stay in the background and let William’s father Prince Charles take the lead in helping raise the heir to the throne found little favour. Fifty-three per cent thought the Middletons should be given a greater role in the baby’s formative years than Prince Charles and Camilla. A Royal source said last night that the autumn programme of engagements is currently being decided and it is expected that Kate will be working alongside William and Harry. ‘We are looking at all three principals being at work in the autumn,’ he said. ‘We are starting booking engagements for her then, as long as she feels well enough.’ The charity Action on Addiction, of which the Duchess is patron, has been told she wants to make another visit before the end of the year. If Kate is well enough to go back to work in the autumn, it will mean she will have roughly three and a half months’ maternity leave – her last official engagement was on June 13 when she christened the Royal Princess cruise liner at Southampton Docks. However, William will not be able to spend more than two weeks changing nappies. He has to return to the RAF in Anglesey, North Wales. Like any new father, he will taking . his statutory paternity leave – the Ministry of Defence will grant him . two weeks. He is unlikely to claim the £136.78 a week benefit. Kate’s . plan to return to the public eye in a few months brings her in line . with the Queen’s maternity leave: she made her first public engagement . three and a half months after giving birth to Prince Charles in November . 1948. The birth of the Royal baby will be recognised by MPs. The Prime Minister will table a motion in the Commons congratulating the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The then Princess . Elizabeth also took two months off after the birth of Princess Anne, but . on the advice of her doctors she had a reduced workload over the . following months. Princess . Diana conducted her first public engagement five weeks after William was . born in 1982. She took only four weeks out after the birth of Harry . before she was back in public. With the Duchess of Cambridge one day overdue, Royal baby fever has gripped the world. There . have been just short of a billion Google hits and almost £1 million has . been placed in bets on the sex, name and date of birth of the new . Royal.

Grandparents: The poll reveals 53 per cent think Kate Middleton's parents Carole and Michael (left) should be closely involved in raising the child while just 47 per cent think Prince Charles and Camilla should have a say in how the Royal baby is brought up .

A medical team . including Dr Marcus Setchell, the Queen’s former gynaecologist, who has . delayed his retirement for the impending arrival, are standing by. The Lindo Wing costs £6,265 for the first day and £2,200 for each one after that.

"By . Barbara Jones . and Jonathan Petre . Condition: Nelson Mandela is still not well enough to leave hospital despite widespread reports that he had been discharged . Nelson Mandela is still not well enough to leave hospital despite widespread reports that he had been discharged, the South African president’s office has said. Mr Mandela, 95, remains ‘critical but stable’, although at times his condition has become more acute and he has required medical intervention. His family had hoped that his health would improve sufficiently for him to return to  his specially adapted home in Johannesburg and be cared  for there. But his condition has continued to fluctuate since he was admitted to hospital in June with a lung infection, which is said to date back to his days in prison. Around the time of his birthday in July, it was widely feared that Mandela was close to death, and crowds kept a vigil  outside his hospital in Pretoria. However, he made an unexpected recovery and sources said that last week he was well enough to enjoy the company of the friends and family who have been visiting him. Mandela’s health was said to have improved so much that he was sitting up and watching television in his hospital bed. South African president Jacob Zuma has urged his country to pray for Mandela and said his predecessor in the role had shown ‘great resilience’. However, it is understood  that despite a statement by Mandela’s former wife Winnie that he is breathing normally, he is still sometimes reliant on medical assistance. One source told The Mail on Sunday that speculation spread because the few details about Mandela’s condition that have been released in recent weeks have been so tightly controlled by his family and the president’s office. ‘There’s been such a news drought on official statements about Mr Mandela’s condition over the summer that rumours are bound to start materialising,’ the source said.

"Iowa gun laws are careful not to deny firearm permits to any resident based on physical disability, even if they’re legally blind. Blind applicants are allowed under state law to purchase weapons and carry them in public, even if they aren’t allowed to hold a driver’s license or are unable to read the application form. While some sheriffs have been granting gun permits to people with visual impairments, others have been denying them  despite a 2011 law that gives blanket rights to hold such permits to all physically disabled Iowans. Shoot 'em up: An Iowa law that gives blanket rights to carry guns to otherwise eligible physically disabled persons is forcing county sheriffs to issue permits to the blind . ‘It seems a little strange, but the way the law reads, we can’t deny them (a permit) just based on that one thing,’ Sergeant Jana Abens, a spokeswoman for the Polk County sheriff’s office, told the Des Moines Register. County officials said they have issued at least three permits to people who can’t legally drive and had trouble reading the application. Other counties have also issue permits, while others have not. ‘I’m not an expert in vision,’ Delaware County Sheriff John LeClere said. ‘At what point do vision problems have a detrimental effect to fire a firearm? If you see nothing but a blurry mass in front of you, then I would say you probably shouldn’t be shooting something.’ Getting technical: Even if the person can't drive a car or even read the permit application, the word of the law grants them the right to apply for a gun permit . Helpless: Some Iowa county sheriffs have acquiesced to the laws, while others have not. 'we can¿t deny them (a permit) just based on that one thing,' said Sgt. Jana Abens with the Polk County Sheriff's office . A man interview by the Register disagreed. Michael Barber, who is blind, was shopping at a gun store in Iowa when he gave the paper his two cents. 'When you shoot a gun, you take it out and point and shoot, and I don't necessarily think eyesight is necessary,' Barber said. It's not clear how many people with visual impairments have permits to carry weapons in Iowa because no one collects that information, but some advocates for the rights of the blind maintain that there should be no question—the blind should be allowed to carry firearms. Following the law? Dubuque County Sheriff Don Vrotsos said that, if a blind person came to his office for a permit, he or she would be denied . ‘The fact that you can't drive a car doesn't mean you can't go to a shooting range and see a target,’ said Jane Hudson with Disability Rights Iowa. Hudson said keeping legally blind people from obtaining weapon permits would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. Some other states, including Nebraska, require anyone applying for a gun permit to provide proof of their visual ability by supplying a driver's license or doctor's statement. Hudson said she thinks someone could successfully challenge Nebraska's vision restriction because federal law requires states to analyze a situation individually before denying a service. Even Patrick Clancy, superintendent of the Iowa Braille and Sight Saving School, said guns may be a rare exception to his philosophy. ‘Although people who are blind can participate fully in nearly all life's experiences, there are some things, like the operation of a weapon, that may very well be an exception,’ Clancy said. Some other states, including Nebraska, require anyone applying for a gun permit to provide proof of their visual ability by supplying a driver's license or doctor's statement. Wild guess: County sheriffs can guess at how many permits they've issued to the blind, but its a statistic no one keeps track of, so no one knows how many blind Iowans currently carry firearms .","No one knows how many blind Iowa residents now legally carry guns because no one keeps track .
The 2011 law that allows the practice gives blanket rights to hold a gun permit to all physically disabled Iowans .
Some county sheriffs are issuing such permits, while others refuse but some advocates say denied blind applicants could easily win appeals ."
"By . Chris Pleasance . It started life 800 years ago as a humble ale jug, used to carry a refreshing pint or two into the countryside during the medieval harvest. Left behind, perhaps by a farm hand who had drunk one too many, the jug lay undiscovered in the grounds of Kedleston Estate until it was rediscovered in 1862. Now, after another 150 years spent gathering dust in an attic, the jug is going to auction and is expected to fetch between £30,000 and £50,000. Ancient history: the Magna Carta was signed by King John just five years before this jug was made . The large glazed jug, described 'as one of the most important and early Medieval relics of the potters art ever discovered', was originally made for use at Duffield Castle in Derbyshire between 1220 and 1250. Found: the glazed pottery was rediscovered in 1862 by a worker draining a field . Auctioneers speculate that it could have been used to carry cider or ale into the countryside to quench the thirst of workers who were gathering in the harvest. After being lost it was rediscovered in 1862 by a worker draining a field. At the time the vessel was kindly lent by . the Right Honourable Lord Scarsdale for exhibition in Derby and . eventually inherited by a  gentleman in Derbyshire . The exterior decoration shows horseshoe and buckle mouldings, the distinctive crests of the Ferrers family who used to live at the castle. It will go on sale at Hansons Auctioneers in Derbyshire on Saturday 28 September. Mr Hanson, manager of the auction house, said: 'The early English Medieval jug is from . the late Norman period and would date to circa 1220. It really is a magical item.' 'When I initially assessed the jug I was informed the pet dog had on a couple of occasions come close to wagging its tail a little too close and knocking it over.' 'The family said it had then been stored in an attic before being discovered and put up for auction.' 'We hope collectors and museums will celebrate such a wonderful item. I really hope it is purchased by a museum and the public can enjoy it like we have at our auction centre.'","The horseshoe was the crest of the Ferrers who lived in Duffield castle .

"By . Philip Ryan . and Mark Duell . Bankrupt: Tom McFeely, who used to live in the home in Ballsbridge, Dublin, is a former IRA hunger striker . Police today finished searching the former home of Priory Hall developer Tom McFeely following the discovery of more than €200,000 under floorboards. Officers from the Criminal Assets Bureau combed the gardens and interior of the IRA hunger striker’s former mansion on Ailesbury Road in South Dublin after an initial discovery of €140,000 (£117,652) last week. The money was found under a bath by a plumber carrying out renovation work on the house which was seized from the failed developer by the National Assets Management Agency. Detectives discovered an additional €60,000 (£50,435) in the same area of the luxury home when they searched the premises two days ago. Taoiseach Enda Kenny today said the discovery ‘smacks’ of the ‘prolificacy and greed’ of the Celtic Tiger years. ‘I understand that an inch by inch survey or investigation is being carried out both on this residence and on the grounds of the premises to see if there is any more there,’ Mr Kenny said. He added: ‘I think all of that smacks . of what happened during the so called Tiger Years when you had . prolificacy and greed and money sloshing around in so many places, this . is further evidence of what happened. House: The former home of one-time IRA hunger striker-turned-property tycoon Tom McFeely on Ailesbury Road in Ballsbridge, south Dublin, where another 60,000 Euros has been discovered stashed in the bathroom . Nama have a clear interest in this and we’ll see what transpires from the investigation, which is currently underway.’ The . money was found in €50 (£42) notes bound in elastic bands and hidden in . plastic bags under the bath in the Ailesbury Road mansion called . Coolbawn. The search . continued today in the garden, garage and a number of rooms of the . redbrick luxury home but Gardai are now satisfied there is no more . hidden money on the grounds. Detectives removed bags of evidence from inside the house for examination before finishing the search. Poster: Tom McFeely (centre right) was one of seven prisoners to spend 53 days on hunger strike in Northern Ireland's Maze jail in 1980. They were seeking the reinstatement of political prisoner status . No one has claimed the money since the discovery was reported and Gardai have yet to question McFeely. CAB today said it found no documentation relating to the ownership of the money, according to RTE News. Detectives are currently trying to establish the history of the notes through serial numbers and finger print tests. The . money will be placed in a bank account controlled by an appointee of . the High Court who was assigned to oversee McFeely’s assets after he was . declared bankrupt. McFeely, . who has debts of around €200million (£168million), told the courts last year he had . less than €1,200 (£1,010) in the bank following his bankruptcy. Probe: Detectives were satisfied that an extensive examination of the vast house in Ballsbridge, Dublin - including lifting floorbeds and pulling down partition walls - had found all the cash hidden inside . Discovery: The money will remain in a bank account under the control of an official assignee appointed by the High Court until a legitimate owner has been identified . The . Priory Hall developer’s failure to adhere to proper building . regulations when constructing the North Dublin apartment block . effectively left 180 people homeless when the property was deemed a fire . hazard. 'I . think all of that smacks of what happened during the so-called Tiger . years, when you had profligacy and greed and money sloshing around in so . many places, that this is further evidence of what happened' Taoiseach Enda Kenny . Former resident . Stephanie Meehan said the stress of repaying the mortgage on their . Priory Hall apartment led to her husband Fiachra Kelly taking his own . life. McFeely’s former . mansion, which once housed the German Embassy, was worth €15million (£12.6million) but . was sold earlier this year for €3milllion (£2.5million). The luxury home was bought by Hilary Hynes, the wife of PR adviser and former Irish editor of The Sunday Times, Rory Godson. The new owners requested the renovation works that led to the discovery of cash last week.

March: Children carry pictures of the hunger-strikers during a Republican rally to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the IRA hunger-strike at the Maze prison in Northern Ireland in May 2001 . McFeely, who served . 12 years in the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland for shooting an RUC . officer, made a €8.5million (£7.2million) settlement with CAB seven years ago. The . portly property developer spent 53 days on hunger strike while . imprisoned in the 1980s. The Derry native and former republican failed . in his attempt to declare himself bankrupt in the UK. His Dublin home was repossessed by Nama when he was eventually declared bankrupt in Ireland last year. He . avoided going back behind bars last July after successfully overturning . a contempt of court judgment. The developer appealed a judgment that he . broke court orders. He had . been ordered by the High Court in Dublin to carry out remedial works at . Priory Hall, but was sentenced and fined when he did not. Barristers . for McFeely appealed it was impossible for their client to comply with . orders because he had been evicted from the site. Demonstration: IRA prisoners went on hunger strike in Northern Ireland's Maze prison in 1980 . Tom McFeely was one of seven prisoners to spend 53 days on hunger strike in Northern Ireland's Maze jail in 1980. They were seeking the reinstatement of political prisoner status. IRA fighter Bobby Sands died in the prison in 1981 after refusing food and water for 66 days. Photographs of him emaciated and on the brink of death have become synonymous with the Republican movement's struggle. Mr Sands's death drew massive worldwide publicity and resulted in him becoming a martyr to the IRA. Poems he wrote while in prison heightened his appeal. His opponents, however, complain that by glorifying Mr Sands's determination his supporters overlook the fact that he had a lengthy criminal record and that he was part of a movement that killed hundreds of innocent people. Mr Sands's hunger strike was dramatised in Hunger, the debut film in 2008 by Turner Prize-winning artist Steve McQueen starring Michael Fassbender.","Detectives believe they have found all the hidden cash in Dublin house .

"By . Ap . The highest court for the U.S. armed forces has agreed to hear the . appeal of a Kansas airman convicted of assault for exposing multiple sex . partners to HIV at swinger parties in Wichita, his attorney said . Friday. David Gutierrez was a sergeant serving at McConnell Air . Force base in Kansas when he was sentenced in 2011 to eight years in . prison and stripped of his rank in an aggravated assault case. Prosecutors told the trial judge that a stiff sentence would send a . message that the military values the integrity of its service members, . saying Gutierrez played Russian roulette with his sexual partners' lives. Air Force Sgt. David Gutierrez, who was convicted of assault for exposing multiple sex partners to HIV at swinger parties in Wichita, Kan., has won an appeal to be heard by the highest court for the U.S. armed forces . The defense on appeal has won a rare opportunity to . present before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces an . argument that his attorney says could set a far-reaching precedent . across the military. 'It will set the table for the entire . military services as to what kind of evidence is necessary to find that . someone can cause grievous bodily injury after testing positive for . HIV,' said Kevin McDermott, one of his defense attorneys. In . addition to the HIV issue, the military appeals court agreed Tuesday to . decide whether the evidence was sufficient to find Gutierrez committed . adultery. The defense contends Gutierrez can't be guilty of adultery . because his wife participated with her husband in the 'swinger's . lifestyle.' The appeals court, essentially the military . equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court, takes fewer than 5 percent of . petitions submitted to it, McDermott said. David Gutierrez was a sergeant serving at McConnell Air Force base in Kansas when he was sentenced in 2011 to eight years in prison and stripped of his rank in an aggravated assault case. A military judge in . Wichita found Gutierrez guilty in January 2011 on seven of eight counts . of aggravated assault and of violating his commander's order to notify . partners about his HIV status and use condoms. The judge also convicted . Gutierrez of indecent acts for having sex in front of others and of . eight counts of adultery. Prosecutors did not immediately respond to an email Friday seeking comment. The . Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction in March . 2013, and the defense appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the . Armed Forces. In its petition, the defense argued that the . evidence was not sufficient to prove Gutierrez was HIV positive. The . test used has since been recalled by the Food and Drug Administration . because it was susceptible to false reactions. His attorneys also . said that even if Gutierrez had HIV, his medical records showed his . viral load was so low during that time that he had a 'zero chance' of . infecting anyone through oral sex and a 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000 . chance of infecting a partner through unprotected intercourse. 'If . the court agrees with us and determines David was not infected to the . point that he could have caused grievous bodily injury to others, this . would gut substantially 90 percent of the case against David,' McDermott . said. The case has not yet been set for oral arguments and no decision is expected until the summer of 2014.","Gutierrez's defense contends he can't be guilty of adultery .

When Winston Churchill was accused of being drunk by socialist MP Bessie Braddock he knew exactly what to say. And the former Prime Minister, who was famed for his wit, has topped a poll of more than 2,000 Britons to find history's funniest insult. As well as the scathing Mr Churchill, the Daily Express reported that other household names including Barack Obama, Groucho Marx, Noel Gallagher and Elizabeth Taylor also made the top ten of the poll, which was commissioned to mark the Blu-ray release of the LIberace biopic Behind The Candelabra. And Liberace himself was also known to give a good put-down when the time was right. The flamboyant star, who is played by Michael Douglas in the film, is also included in the poll with his classic one liner to a critic who gave him a bad review. He said: 'Thank you for your very amusing review. After reading it...I laughed all the way to the bank.' The subject of many of the celebrities' ire is often other celebrities.

"By . Gerri Peev . An immigration minister rounded on a five-times failed asylum seeker on live television and told him to go home. Mark Harper said that Iraqi-Kurd Esam Amin’s request for asylum was ‘not credible and ridiculous’. British courts have denied him asylum on five occasions. Mr Harper said: ‘We don’t believe you and neither did the judge.’ Leave: Tory minister Mark Harper (left) said Iraqi Esam Amin had no right to stay in Britain after repeatedly losing claims for asylum in the courts . The senior Tory minister was responsible for the controversial ‘go home’ ads displayed on vans in London that told illegal migrants to leave the UK. Critics attacked the campaign as racist and offensive. But Mr Harper still wants to roll out the scheme across the country. On the BBC’s Sunday Politics West, Mr Amin, a refugees’ rights campaigner, said he fled Iraq in November 2007 because his life was in danger. He has tried to claim asylum in Bristol since 2008, and says he has been left with only £5 a day to live on after his most recent appeal. A riled Mr Harper said: ‘With the greatest respect, when you were here claiming asylum, taxpayers supported you. You now have no right to be in the United Kingdom and you should return. Hardworking families will be sat there finding it incredible someone has had the chance to go through a system, have had a decision, have appealed it to a judge and they have been found not to have the need for our protection. ‘They would think it is incredible that the taxpayer should continue supporting them.’ He added: ‘If people abuse our system, it will damage the British public’s tolerance for people genuinely fleeing persecution. We have a fair system where he is able to go through a legal process and the judge didn’t find his claim credible, in fact he said parts of his claim were “not credible and ridiculous”. I’m afraid he has no right to be in the United Kingdom.’ Mr Amin said: ‘I am not an illegal person, I am an asylum seeker. I am a human being like you. My life in my country is in danger. ‘That’s why I decided, and I left my family and everything, to come here. I came to find a safe place. ‘I know my story is true and your system doesn’t believe me.’ Confrontation: The stand-off came on live television, with Mr Harmer making clear that Mr Amin has no right to stay in Britain . Tough: Mr Harper was the minister who signed off the controversial 'Go Home' ad vans which toured London this summer . Mr Amin said he was ‘lucky’ to have friends who housed him while other asylum seekers sleep rough. He has made a short film about asylum seekers’ fears when they have to report to police stations. A trained chef, he has been named one of Bristol’s ‘happiness champions’ by a local paper. He says he cannot work, or pay for English lessons because he has not been granted leave to stay in the UK. A Home Office spokesman declined to say if action was being taken against Mr Amin. But the official added: ‘We firmly believe those who do not need our protection should return home at the earliest opportunity. ‘Mr Amin has no right to be in the UK and should return home.’","Tory Mark Harper says Iraqi Esam Amin has no right to stay in Britain .

Shammi Atwal, 45, was pushed under a moving skip lorry as he chased a gang who had tried to rob his cash and carry outlet in Barking . A wealthy businessman was killed when he was pushed into the path of a lorry by a gang of armed robbers. Shammi Atwal, 45, was shoved into the road as he struggled with up to ten masked raiders armed with sledgehammers and metal bars. The father-of-two died from  catastrophic injuries just yards from his wife who had locked herself inside their drinks wholesale company. Scotland Yard launched a murder inquiry as detectives paid tribute to Mr Atwal’s bravery in trying to defend his wife and business. Speaking at the £750,000 family home in Chigwell, Essex, last night, cousin Surjit Atwal, 50, said they had suffered a ‘huge loss’. He said Mr Atwal’s wife Deepa, 37, who suffered minor injuries in the raid, has been left ‘devastated’. ‘What we understand has happened is a few people tried to come in and tried to rob the place. ‘He tried to stop them and in the scuffle he was pushed under the lorry,’ he added. ‘His wife is obviously devastated. She was there at the time. She was trying to lock the doors and keep them out so does not know what happened after they left the building. ‘It is a huge shock. You go to work and try to earn some money for your family and you do not expect something like this to happen.’ The robbery took place at Mr Atwal’s company, Glenn & Co, a  supplier to the hospitality industry, in Barking, Essex, on Monday.

Then five minutes later they ran . back past holding bags and sledgehammers. ‘We all knew Mr Atwal well. He would come here often, sometimes with his young daughter. ‘He was a good man, a hard-working man.’ Mr Atwal, who had a daughter, four, and son, seven, had run the drinks firm for almost a decade. The latest company accounts show it is worth more than £1million. Surjit Atwal said the family had been working in Britain for ‘many years’ after emigrating from the  Punjab, India.

"By . Ryan Kisiel . It might just be a small brick bungalow that looks like it could do with a bit of modernisation. But this single-storey home, which cost just £8,500 around 40 years ago, is now back on the market - with an asking price of nearly £1million. The three-bedroom property has one reception room, a kitchen, a utility room and a 1970s-style bathroom. High price, low roof: The Bungalow in Dulwich, south London, is on the market for £985,000 . Close to two public schools and a large park, it is located in Dulwich, South London, opposite the house Margaret Thatcher lived in after she left Downing Street in 1990. With prices rising to their highest levels in more than a decade, the bungalow is now on the market for £985,000 – the cost of a six-bedroom Grade II-listed house in Birmingham. And for £1million a buyer could have a seven-bedroom detached house in Somerset, complete with swimming pool. When the property’s owner was asked if he was surprised by its value, he said: ‘No, it was a des res area when I bought it 40 years ago and it still is. ‘Mrs Thatcher lived over there, as her husband loved to play golf and the Dulwich course is close.’ Roomy: The reception area is spacious but would benefit from being redecorated . Outdated: The flat features this 1970s-style bathroom . But a neighbour said: ‘It’s hard to get planning permission around here because we live in a conservation area and the committee is very strict, so extending might be difficult.’ They added: ‘House prices have gone crazy, but especially around here.

Crackdown: Sweets and treats at supermarket checkouts have become an 'area for action' in the drive to improve the nation's health . When he first became Tory leader David Cameron famously took aim at WH Smith for promoting chocolate oranges instead of real ones. But the coalition has been conflicted about whether the government should dictate what stores can sell. In July this year Ms Soubry said it was ‘worrying’ that some supermarkets ‘continue to influence people – especially young children – to pick up sweets and chocolate while waiting at the checkout’. She said that food manufacturers and retailers ‘bear a responsibility’ to help people to live longer, healthier lives. Pester: Parents complain that the positioning of chocolate means children demand treats . But just weeks later she insisted she . would not ban so-called ‘guilt lanes’. She added: ‘I dislike the idea . that if you treat yourself you should feel guilty. I just said no to my . children.’ Ms Soubry was moved to the Ministry of Defence in this month’s reshuffle, and replaced by Ms Ellison. Now Ms Ellisson has signalled that she will take action against junk food at checkouts. In response to a parliamentary question, she said: . ‘There is evidence that the majority of food promoted at checkouts and . in queuing areas is less healthy than elsewhere, and that foods sold at . impulse purchase points such as checkouts experience uplifts in sales. Obesity: New public health minister Jane Ellison complained that many of the snacks on offer at checkouts are among the least healthy . ‘According to one report, parents have indicated that positioning of sweets at checkouts can increase pestering to purchase by their children. ‘We have identified food promotion as an area for action under the Responsibility Deal, and will be discussing with the food industry actions it might take to reduce exposure to marketing and promotion of less healthy foods.’ In England, 16.3 per cent of children aged two to 15 are obese and 13.7 per cent of children aged two to 15 are overweight – making them far more likely to develop health conditions like type two diabetes and heart disease. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We have been clear that legislation is not necessary and that the voluntary approach through the Responsibility Deal is working. 'It has already significantly reduced artificial trans-fat, calories and salt in foods, and set-up consistent front of pack food labelling which all the major supermarkets and several big manufacturers have signed up to. 'That is why we have identified food promotion as an area for action under the Responsibility Deal, and will be discussing with the food industry actions it might take to reduce exposure to marketing and promotion of less healthy foods.' In 2006 Mr Cameron condemned ‘irresponsible’ marketing designed to coax people into buying sweets and chaoclate. ‘Try and buy a newspaper at the train station and, as you queue to pay, you're surrounded, you're inundated by cut price offers for giant chocolate bars,’ he said. ‘As Britain faces an obesity crisis, why does WH Smith's promote half-price Chocolate Oranges at its checkouts instead of real oranges?’ Among the worst offenders visited by the Mail earlier this year were: . M & S: . Shoppers forced to queue in a snaking aisle fenced in by racks of . snacks. On child-height shelves were rows of Percy Pig and Colin . Caterpillar sweets. W H SMITH: Garish . signs advertising three Wispa bars for £1 and two-for-£2 Coca-Cola . bottles. Checkout assistants often presented customers with further . offers. POUNDLAND: Five-foot walls of boxes of sweets and chocolates led to the checkout. PRIMARK: Sweets . such as Haribo, Chewits, Mentos and Polos on offer at £1 for five . packets sat beside socks and underwear at the queues for the tills. SAINSBURY’S: . Most large branches had few sweets on display at main tills, but . self-checkout customers were funnelled through temptation to reach the . units. At convenience-style ‘Local’ stores, customers were met with rows . of mints and chocolate bars before they could get to the checkouts. BOOTS: Sweets and snacks such as crisps had a  prominent place on the way to the tills.","New minister Jane Ellison says sweets at tills is an 'area for action'

"By . Andy Dolan . In Ibiza: Rachel Turner with her boyfriend Michael Tollerfield. A coroner has ordered police to re-investigate the death of the student in Ibiza following a fall after her family claimed she was pushed . A coroner has ordered police to re-investigate the death of a British student in Ibiza following a fall after her family claimed she was pushed. Relatives of fashion undergraduate Rachel Turner, 22, insist that she did not throw herself off a 15ft high balcony. They spent £70,000 on their own investigation which claims Miss Turner had injuries to her hands and fingers – suggesting she attempted to cling to the balcony ledge before she fell. Private detectives also discovered text messages had been deleted from her phone before and after her death. An inquest that started this week was brought to a halt on Wednesday after the new claims were presented to coroner Sarah Ormonde-Walsh, who asked police to contact the Spanish authorities over the death in October 2007. Pathologist Dr David Rouse also told the Birmingham hearing the ‘excessive damage’ to Miss Turner’s fingers gave him ‘concern’. He added: ‘It suggests that there  was struggling to prevent yourself from falling. It’s something far more sinister.’ Miss Turner’s devastated parents, Leslie – a company director – and Jane, 63, a former midwife, are convinced their ‘happy’ daughter was murdered. Mrs Turner, from Northfield, Birmingham, said: ‘We think Rachel was pushed. Dr Rouse, the pathologist said that most of her finger nails were missing. He said that is highly suspicious.’ Outside court, Mr Turner, added: ‘I am 100 per cent certain she was killed – I’ve got no doubt. ‘When we went to the inquest the coroner was taken aback by this three-inch thick file of all the information we’d gathered. ‘In her opening remarks the coroner said, “I can clearly see you’ve been to the ends of the earth to put this before me”.’ Miss Turner, who was studying at Birmingham City University, was working as a club promoter on the Spanish island during her summer holidays when the incident happened. She died six days after being airlifted home to the UK and Spanish authorities later concluded she had intentionally jumped from a stairwell ledge at a housing complex in San Antonio. Still in mourning: Parents, Leslie and Jane, and sister, 25-year-old Sarah, lost Rachel in October 2007 . Miss Turner's parents Jane and Leslie are '100 per cent certain' she was murdered in Ibiza . But Mr Turner told the hearing his daughter had been ‘happy’ and ‘chatty’ and had been organising a welcome home party for herself. He also claimed his daughter had been plagued by a male admirer in the run-up to her death after she had spurned his romantic advances. He said the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was ‘never arrested or seriously questioned about her death’. The inquest heard Rachel, who was a student at Birmingham City University, had not intended to harm herself . Miss . Turner’s boyfriend Michael Tollerfield, who worked in security in Ibiza . but now lives in Edinburgh, sobbed yesterday as he told how he had . tried to revive Miss Turner after she fell. He . claimed she was upset and spoke about ‘personal things’ when he found . her sitting on the ledge with her feet over the side. ‘One second she . was there and the next she wasn’t,’ he said. West Midlands Police said it will refer the concerns raised by Miss Turner’s family to the Spanish authorities. Some 800 people attended the funeral of Rachel, pictured here when she was younger . Rachel's mother, Jane, a former midwife, said she and Rachel's sister Sarah, 25, were still in mourning .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Chris Pleasance . She said I could: John Grant Tasered his wife several times after she lost a bet about the winner of Monday night's nail biter Bears vs. Packers game . This is the bizarre moment an Illinois man Tasered his wife three times after winning a bet on a football game. At last Monday's Bears-Packers game in a Wisconsin bar, John Grant, 42, a Bears fan, and his wife Nicole, a Packers supporter, decided to make things interesting. They agreed that whoever's team won would be allowed shock the other with a Taser, and when the Bears won 27-20 and the couple walked outside to an alleyway where Nicole leaned up against the wall ready for her forfeit. While she starts the video laughing, after the first shock she collapses to the floor, shielding herself behind a friend's legs, obviously in pain. Oblivious to her suffering, Grant reaches through the other man's legs and administers a second shock, before walking around to her side and hitting her again, this time on her thigh. Deciding she had had enough, Nicole called the police just after midnight on Tuesday who arrested John for possessing a Taser, which is illegal without a licence in Wisconsin. Nicole also told dispatchers her husband had thrown their dog out of the semi-truck they were sharing as their home and then locked her out too. Christopher MacNeill, chief of Mayville Police Department, said: 'You just couldn't make it up.' Speaking to CNN, he added: 'The Taser that he had was a skin contact taser which, if you use it enough times or in the same place, can actually leave burn marks.' Scroll down for video .

His wife, Grant told the police, smoked too much of the stuff and it hinders her from keeping a job. Speaking to CNN, Chris Neu, a bartender at the Small Town Wisconsin Tavern, said: 'They had a bet between the two of them. The loser was supposed to get Tasered by the winner. 'She kind of laughed it off, they videotaped it and everything else. I had no inkling at all that the would end up in a altercation at the end of the night.'

"By . Ryan Gorman . A veteran Philadelphia homicide detective has been suspended amid accusations of lying about the circumstances surrounding three murders, as well as the disappearance of a fourth person. Ron Dove, 41, and on the force for 16 years, has a lot of questions to answer after investigators uncovered human remains and other evidence linking the detective to a string of suspicious coincidences. The murders and missing person have all been linked to Mr Dove’s 33-year-old girlfriend Erica Sanchez, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Good cop gone bad?: Ronald Dove is accused of lying to investigators about multiple murders involving girlfriend Erica Sanchez, as well as hiding her from authorities . The search for evidence has taken officials from Mr Dove’s iPad to a trash-filled ravine on the city’s north side. Investigators have been digging through the area after uncovering information about missing man Reynaldo Torres, the paper said. Mr Torres has not been seen or heard from in well over a year. Mr Dove is also suspected of lying about Ms Sanchez’s involvement in the murder of Melanie Colon, a cousin of Mr Torres, the paper reported. Ms Colon, 22, was found face-down behind an apartment building after being shot six times, the paper noted. Cops digging through the ravine found what is believed to be a human jaw bone, the Inquirer reported. Double tragedy: Cousins Reynaldo Torres, missing for over a year, and Melanie Colon, found dead behind a seedy apartment building, her body riddled with six gun shots . The find came one week after the Philadelphia Police Department suspended Mr Dove with the intent to dismiss, officials previously announced. He had been a homicide detective for eight years and was making about $160,000 a year, the paper noted. The heat first turned up on Mr Dove, according to the Inquirer, after he was suspected of helping Ms Sanchez high-tail it out of the city after being fingered as a suspect in the stabbing death of ex-boyfriend Cesar Vera. He is accused of hiding her car and paying for a hotel hide-out in Rochester, NY, for the murder suspect while he told internal affairs he had no idea where she was. The detective is also suspected to have concealed evidence in the 2010 shooting death of Leslie Delzingaro at a bar owned by Ms Sanchez’s father, sources told the paper. Mr Dove was the lead detective on that case. Even more damning is the evidence against Mr Dove found on the iPad of a man arrested last month with over $300,000 worth of heroin – pictures of the smiling detective in the bar with his arm around the suspected drug dealer . Ms Sanchez is currently in custody and has been charged in connection with Mr Vera’s murder.","Ron Dove was on the force for 16 years, and a homicide detective since 2005, before his suspension last week .

A Florida mother has been arrested on suspicion of child abuse after police say she had slipped her 6-year-old son Adderall to see if it alters his behavior. Heather McAuliffe, 39, of Boca Raton, was taken into custody Thursday and released from Palm County Jail later that day after posting a $3,000 bond. According to investigators, McAuliffe emailed her son's first-grade teacher about her Adderall experiment and asked her for updates on any changes in his conduct. ‘I tried something today… I gave (son’s name) 5 MG of my Adderall just to see if there is a noticeable difference,' she wrote in the message cited by Sun-Sentinel. ‘ He does not know because i crushed it up in his yogurt.’ Adderall is a prescription drug used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. McAuliffe concluded her message by asking the teacher to email her if she notices 'any changes' in the 6-year-old's behavior in class. On Thursday, police went to McAuliffe’s home in the 22000 block of Palms Way West to question her about the email. The 39-year-old mother allegedly confessed to giving her son Adderall, saying she did it to help him.

"By . Chris Pleasance . A previously unknown anti-establishment group has claimed responsibility for a drive-by shooting which killed two men in Greece. The Militant People's Revolutionary Forces said its members were behind the death of two Golden Dawn supporters gunned down outside the party's headquarters earlier this month. The organisation said the killings were in retaliation for the fatal stabbing of anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fissas in September by a man who claimed to be a sympathiser of far-right party Golden Dawn. The Militant People's Revolutionary Forces' has claimed responsibility for the drive-by shooting of two members of Greece's far-right part Golden Dawn earlier this month . The group said the killings were revenge for the fatal stabbing of anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fissas in September which sparked violent protests in the Greek capital . The two victims were gunned down outside Golden Dawn's headquarters in Athens while a third man aged 29 was taken to hospital . In an 18-page letter posted online the group explained their motivation, saying that the stabbing had been 'the drop of blood that made the glass overflow'. It added: 'The armed attack-response ... is the starting point of the people's campaign to send the neo-Nazi scum of Golden Dawn where they belong, to the dustbin of history.' Police were unable to confirm authenticity of the claim, which came on the eve of rallies to commemorate the 40th anniversary of a bloody student uprising against the military junta that ruled Greece at the time. Pavlos Fyssas, the rapper who was stabbed in the working-class Athens district of Keratsini early on September 18 by a 45-year-old truck driver who proclaimed his Golden Dawn sympathies . The slogan painted on this wall at the spot where Fissas was killed ominously promises 'revenge' The two victims, aged 22 and 27, were shot at close range outside a Golden Dawn office in Athens' Neo Iraklio suburb by two men riding a motorcycle. 'A man got off a motorcycle wearing a helmet and shot them,' Golden Dawn lawmaker Georgios Germenis told The Associated Press. A statement on the party's website described how the gunmen had 'literally emptied their weapons' into the victims. A third man, aged 29, was taken to hospital severely wounded after he too was shot. The government and opposition parties quickly condemned the shootings, which the left-wing main opposition Syriza said 'targets democracy' in Greece. Nicholas Mihaloliakos (right), Golden Dawn's leader, was arrested following the stabbing for creating a criminal organisation and is in custody awaiting trail along with two others . Golden Dawn has previously suggested that all immigrants should be put into work camps and said it wants mines laid along the border with Turkey . Golden Dawn denies accusations of violence and rejects the neo-Nazi label. It denies any involvement in Fissas's killing. An opinion poll released on Saturday indicated that support for Golden Dawn had grown since the two men were gunned down. The party, Greece's third most popular in surveys, had shed almost a third of its support after Fissas's death. Fissas, whop went by the stage name of Killah P, was stabbed in the working-class Athens district of Keratsini early on September 18 by a 45-year-old truck driver who has confessed. The attack prompted a crackdown on Golden Dawn and its leader Nicholas Mihaloliakos, along with five more party members, were arrested for being part of a criminal organisation. Mihaloliakos and two others are still in custody while they await trail. Their arrests marked the first time since 1974 that sitting members of Parliament have been arrested.","Militant People's Revolutionary Forces have claimed responsibility for killings .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . David Hockney, known as one of the most versatile artists of the 20th century, has embraced tablet technology for his latest exhibition. The 76-year-old has always been interested in experimenting with new techniques, but the launch of the iPhone and iPad has taken his work to a new level. A San Francisco gallery is exhibiting work Hockney has created on the devices in the past ten years as he shows how technology has influenced artists for centuries. Modern art: David Hockney with an iPad showing one of his Bigger Exhibition works . The most up-to-date work on show at de Young Museum is a series of 12ft prints, entitled Bigger Yosemite, which Hockney created on an iPad. His experimentation with the smart technology began with the iPhone, which allowed him to make sketches with his thumbs, but the release of the iPad expanded his possibilities. 'I . do think it is a new medium. I found it more interesting than Photoshop . because you can pick up a color from another color. And you can work . very fast. And that's something every draftsman is interested in,' Hockney told the Los Angeles Times. The . iPad's mobility also appealed. It fitted comfortably in the pockets he . has sewn into his jackets for his sketchbooks, and it meant he no longer needed to carry around paints and pencils. The speed of the creative process has made the last year one of the most prolific in the artist's long career. 'His . use of the iPad has gone way beyond sketching on the screen to become a . core part of his creative process,' according to the audio tour that . accompanies the exhibition. Bigger picture: A screen shows how Hockney's painting of Yosemite National Park was developed on an iPad . Inspired: Hockney with his work in Bilbao's Guggenheim. The size and mobility of the iPad allows Hockney to sketch easily anywhere . The British artist, who has a studio in California, has always been intrigued by new media. When photocopiers were first released Canon used to send him ink cartridges to experiment with. At the end of the 90s Hockney began to research how old masters had used optical devices to improve their technique and perspective, CNN reported. He discovered that 19th century artists had used technology such as the camera lucida - a small prism on a metal arm that let them refract an image on to canvas. Hockney's research, and subsequent book - Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters - has resulted in the latest exhibition which includes work created on iPads and video cameras, as well as more traditional methods. 'Like an artist alchemist, in one minute Hockney uses a fancy digital device to make a colorful iPad drawing; in the next he shows us that he is one of our greatest draftsmen by rendering an exactingly detailed charcoal drawing of a forest scene in East Yorkshire,' Richard Benefield, of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, said. Creative: Yosemite I, October 16th 2011 is one of the images Hockney created on his iPad . Muse: Yosemite II, October 5th 2011 by David Hockney. The artist says his iPad fits comfortably in his jacket pocket . New media: The picture, A Bigger Matelot Kevin Druez 2, was created in 2009 as an Inkjet printed computer drawing . Selfie: The British artist has always embraced new technology, but the iPad has opened up more possibilities . Part of the exhibition charts the history of art in a huge piece entitled The Great Wall. The 8ft by 72ft work is a chronological history of how optical aids have influenced western art. Included among the sketches and paintings, on show until January 20, are four sets of screens showing footage of the same country road in the changing seasons. Hockney created it by mounting video cameras on a vehicle, which he controlled as a studio assistant drove along the road. 'It’s clear from the pace at . which Hockney continues to produce such important work - and the fearless . nature of his innovation - that he has conceded nothing to his 76 years,' Mr Benefield said.","San Francisco gallery displays work sketched on tablet devices .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . American Thanksgiving turkeys are getting bigger and bigger and have broken a new record this year with an average weight of over 30 pounds for the first time ever, almost double of what it weighed in 1960. According to numbers taken from January to October this year, the average weight of a commercially bred turkey is 30.47 pounds. In 1960, the average weight of a turkey was just 16.83 pounds, and in 1985, it was only 20 pounds. Turkeys hit the 25-pound mark in 1999. Bigger and better? Turkeys have broken a new record this year with an average weight of over 30 pounds for the first time ever, gradually increasing in weight since 1960 . Get. In. The. Oven: Turkeys are bigger than ever before, double that of 1960 when they weighed only 16.83 on average . The sharp increase in weight is largely due to artificial insemination (AI), according to The Atlantic. Artificial insemination is a required part of turkey breeding as the modern bird is too heavy and misshapen with its massive breast area to procreate the old fashioned way. John Anderson, a long-time breeder at Ohio State University, said the process ‘adds a whole new level of efficiency’. ‘You can spread [the male’s semen] over more hens. It takes the lid off how big the bird can be.’ William Henry Burrows and Joseph P. Quinn of the US Department of Agriculture developed the process of artificially inseminating turkeys and chickens and published their findings in 1939. They worked the kinks out of the process . over a series of years and discovered it was best to collect semen from . turkey toms once per day, though one could try as often as twice per . day. If they waited two days, they got the ‘maximum quantity at one collection’, but not enough to make up for skipping the off day. How to do it: The US Department of Agriculture developed the process of artificially inseminating turkeys and chickens and published the findings in 1939 . Smaller: Turkeys at a farm in Utah in the 1960s. The birds were almost half the size they are now . And . on the receiving end, they found the right dosage of semen to achieve . good fertility. That turned out to be 0.1cc of semen once per week from a . mix of males to offset any poor performers. Andrew F. Smith wrote a great academic work called The Turkey, which provides a very detailed description of the AI process. According to Smith, the process of insemination must be done by hand. ‘First, . semen is collected by picking up a tom by its legs and one wing and . locking it to a bench with rubber clamps, rear facing upward. Not the same: Wild Heritage turkeys like this one are not being used for our Thanksgiving dinners. The Broad Breasted White breed now dominates the market for commercial production . Creatures of the past: The Heritage Turkey, left, is what the pilgrims would have eaten for Thanksgiving. A man in 1920, right, is seen feeding them. The turkeys that land on the modern-day Thanksgiving dining table are artificially inseminated and are nothing like the birds of the past . 'The . copulatory organs are stimulated by stroking the tail feathers and back; . the vent is squeezed; and semen is collected with an aspirator, a glass . tube that vacuums it in.’ He goes on to explain that the semen is then combined with ‘extenders’ that include antibiotics and a saline solution to give more control over the inseminating dose. A syringe is filled, taken to the hen house, and inserted into the artificial insemination machine. A . worker grabs a hen's legs, crosses them, and holds the hen with one . hand. With the other hand the worker wipes the hen's backside and pushes . up her tail. Pressure is applied to her abdomen, which causes the . cloaca to evert and the oviduct to protrude. A tube is inserted into the . vent, and the semen is injected. Mass production: The Broad Breasted White breed of turkeys now dominates the market. They have shorter breast bones and larger breasts, and they produce more breast meat than their ancestors . Ta daa! A man proudly holds his Thanksgiving feast. Because of decades of artificial insemination, the bird now has a lot more meat . The process spread fairly slowly but by the 1960s it was widespread, marking the introduction of the Broad Breasted White breed that now dominates the market. The turkeys of 2013 have been precision . engineered by generations of scientists and corporations to deliver more . and more marketable turkeys at a continuously lower cost. These birds have shorter breast bones and larger breasts, and they produce more breast meat than their ancestors. The bird's properties have made the breed popular in commercial turkey production but enthusiasts of slow food argue that the development of this breed and the methods in commercial turkey production have come at a cost of less flavor.","American Thanksgiving turkeys broke a new record this year with an average weight of over 30 pounds for the first time ever .

"By . Daniel Martin . Labour MP Margaret Hodge has warned the Charity Commission is 'not fit for purpose' and 'risks undermining public trust' in charities . Money given to charity could be diverted to terrorists because a watchdog is not investigating abuses properly, a damning report has warned. The Charity Commission monitors voluntary organisations over three areas of high risk: fraud, whether they safeguard beneficiaries, and counter-terrorism. But it now has only two members of staff doing this work and just 42 probes were started last year, compared to 306 a year before the last election, increasing a ‘risk that serious concerns will go undetected’. In a critical report, the National Audit Office spending watchdog said failings could damage public faith in good causes. The commission needs a ‘radical change of pace and rigour’, it said. Bosses were warned to expect ‘tough questions’ when they appear before the Commons public accounts committee this month. Its chairman, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, said the report suggested the body was not ‘fit for purpose’ and ‘risks undermining public trust’ in charities. It is an indictment of the chairmanship of so-called ‘quango queen’ Dame Suzi Leather, who left in July last year. Over her six-year reign Dame Suzi, who held a number of other public posts at the same time, attracted controversy for her criticism of independent schools. She was paid £80,000 for a three-day week. The NAO report was prompted by MPs’ concerns at a complex tax avoidance scheme engaged in by charity The Cup Trust. It gave just £152,292 to good causes despite trying to claim back a stunning £46million in Gift Aid from tax authorities on its £177million income. The commission launched a full investigation in April, admitting the case was ‘a disaster for the charity sector’. It insists its records suggest the case was unique – but it did identify 13 other charities which required investigation. But the NAO said the body should have acted far sooner. Its report found the commission was ‘not regulating charities effectively’ and was failing to provide value for money to the taxpayer for its £22.7million-a-year budget. It said: ‘It does important and necessary work and its independent status is highly valued, but it does not do enough to identify and tackle abuse of charitable status.’ It noted that the NAO had ‘repeatedly identified concerns’ in reports stretching back more than 25 years, and said that the commission was slow to act. ‘It uses its information poorly to assess risk and often relies solely on trustees’ assurances. ‘Where it does identify concerns in charities, it makes little use of its powers and fails to take tough action in some of the most serious cases. ‘The commission is too passive in pursuing its objectives, letting practical and legal barriers prevent action, rather than considering alternative ways to prevent abuse of charitable status.’ The NAO criticised the Charity . Commission for reducing staff monitoring things like counter-terrorism . from around eight full-time equivalents to two. The report comes as an indictment of the chairmanship of so-called 'quango queen' Dame Suzi Leather, pictured, who left in July last year . The report said: ‘It opened 42 monitoring cases in 2012/13 and 72 in 2011/12, 276 in 2010/11 and 306 in 2009/10. This reduction in monitoring cases increases the risk that serious concerns will  go undetected.’ In the three years to March, not one charity trustee was removed by the commission, only two were suspended and there were only 17 instances where it intervened to prevent charities entering transactions. One pound in every ten of its budget was spent on accommodation and staff complaints about an unreliable IT system. Efforts to cope with a recent 40 per cent budget cut failed to ‘put sufficient emphasis on the rigour of its registration process and its investigation of wrongdoing’, the NAO said. The report concluded: ‘We welcome the commission’s intention to change its strategy, and encourage the new board to bring about the radical change of pace and rigour which is so evidently needed.’ Sam Younger, the commission’s chief executive, will appear before the public accounts committee on December 16, nine months after he was grilled on the Cup Trust case. Mrs Hodge suggested then that there could be as many as 50 other tax avoidance cases – but the NAO report said the commission’s internal investigations had discounted that claim. Sir Stuart Etherington, of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said: ‘This report reflects what we have said for years. In order to maintain public trust, charities want a vigilant and effective regulator which takes prompt action in the rare instances of abuse.'","Critical report was compiled by the National Audit Office .

"By . Barbara Jones . The morning after Nelson Mandela’s death, in the windswept gloom, one man made a solitary journey to the former maximum security prison on Robben Island. There, in what has become a monument to the anti-apartheid struggle, he said a silent prayer. Christo Brand, a white prison warder who locked up Mandela and his political comrades nightly for four years, enjoyed an unlikely friendship with the man who went on to become South Africa’s President. They remained close until the end. Their unique friendship was sealed on the stormy day that, 33 years ago, Mandela’s wife Winnie arrived on Robben Island with their baby granddaughter Zoleka. Eternal bond: Christo Brand was a prison guard at Robben Island during Mandela's time in incarceration and risked his job to ensure he met his baby granddaughter in 1980 . Now for the first time, Christo . reveals the extraordinary story of how he smuggled the baby past his . fellow guards in an act of mercy unprecedented in Mandela’s 18 years on . Robben Island. One of the . cruellest rules there  was that prisoners should never  touch or see a . child, not even one from the warders’ families – something that was . particularly hard for African prisoners from traditional extended . families. It is well-recorded that Mandela felt crippled by the lack of communication with children. In . 1980, during the harshest regime on the island, he received a visit . from  Winnie. She was a ‘banned’ person under the Apartheid government, . forced to live in a township on the outskirts of Pretoria, a day’s drive . from Cape Town and its prison island. On . a rainy day, she made her way to the ferry to see her husband for the . 30-minute visit that they were allowed just once every three months. Special visit: Zoleka Mandela, pictured in 2011, was only four months old when she was sneaked past security by Christo Brand to see her great grandfather . White people went inside the . weatherproof cabin. Winnie and the other black visitors were directed to . the top deck, exposed to the wind and rain. She took her place . uncomplaining, wrapping herself in a blanket. When . she arrived on the island it was discovered she had smuggled a baby . with her – the four-month-old granddaughter Nelson Mandela had never . seen. Christo remembers it . well. ‘Of course, we could not allow her to take the baby in to see her . husband,’ he says. ‘She had to leave the child in someone’s care in the . waiting room. She pleaded with me to allow Mandela to see her but I had . to refuse. ‘As usual they . sat either side of  the glass screen, their hands touching on the glass. I stood behind Mandela. He said, “Please Mr Brand, let me at least see . the baby as my wife carries her away after the visit”. ‘I . spoke to the warrant officer, my superior. We both knew it was . impossible. But at the end of 30 minutes I told Mandela to wait. I went . into the waiting room and told Winnie I’d like to hold the baby. ‘I told her I had never held a black baby. She let me have her and I walked back to Mandela behind the security screen. 'I called Mandela and put the baby in his arms, unexpectedly. I told him he must keep quiet about it or we could lose our jobs. 'He just said: “Oh” and held the . child, and kissed her and there were tears in his eyes. I had to take . the baby and give her back to Winnie and not even tell her what had . happened. ‘Nobody could . know that Mandela had ever seen the child. He kept it a secret from . everybody and so I was very pleased he did that.’ Isolation: Nelson Mandela in his confinement cell on Robben Island where he had been incarcerated for 27 years for his views in opposition of the apartheid regime . It seems Mandela never forgot that . kindness. Many years later after his release, in the midst of the . worldwide fanfare of publicity, he called Christo and invited him to . Parliament. He offered him a . job in the Constitutional Assembly, entertained Christo and his wife to . tea at his  presidential residence, and invited the former warder to . his birthday celebrations for the rest of his life. Christo . was just 19, a raw prison service recruit, when he was sent to the . island to join the security team guarding South Africa’s most demonised . freedom fighters. He was . warned that they were a band of dangerously ruthless men dedicated to . overthrowing the government. Their leader was a powerful, thoughtful . Xhosa tribesman who immediately astounded Christo with his politeness . and humility. ‘He was 60 . years old, I was just a boy from the farm,’ says Christo. ‘I saw the . sometimes brutal way other guards treated the maximum security . prisoners. I saw the way that Mandela responded. ‘He would kneel down, uncomplaining, to sweep up the dust and dirt  outside his cell when there was going to be an inspection. ‘He had a quietness and a mental . discipline I’d never seen before. I was a teenager and he called me  “Mr . Brand” with what seemed like real respect. ‘I was prepared to hate this man trying to bring us all down and ruin our country. Instead I was won over by him very quickly. ‘I . saw his suffering and near-desperation when we censored every word . going to him or coming from him, and recorded every conversation he . held. ‘I used to stand . behind him during the few visits he was allowed and I could see the . anguish in him when his beloved wife Winnie was there, on the other side . of a glass screen. I read all his letters to her and her replies to . him. Desperate attempt: Winnie Mandela broke the rules when she attempted to smuggle in the baby, and she never knew that the Mr Brand had brought the baby to Madiba . ‘He was the clear leader of all the political prisoners and he never stopped trying to get their messages out to the rest of the world. But he also missed his wife and children, and their family life.’ Christo began to realise that Mandela’s humanity was psychologically reversing their roles. Impressed with the unwavering regime that Mandela imposed on himself – the morning exercise; the tending of a vegetable patch he nurtured outside his cell; the reading and studying when he was allowed an electric light; the interminable passing of notes to his comrades through ever-more ingenious means – Christo found himself continually on the receiving end of overwhelming sympathy from the older man. ‘You had to respect him, the dignified way he accepted the rules and regulations, the way he never asked for any favours or showed anything but respect for me and my job,’ Christo says. ‘Soon he was giving me advice and telling me I should study and achieve a better education and career. He seemed to want the best for me. ‘Once, when he had been moved to . Pollsmoor Prison on the mainland,  I came into his cell and saw a small . container had been lowered into it through the slated windows. Other . prisoners were communicating with him in this way. ‘He . looked at me and said, “You need to report this.” He knew that  I . couldn’t bend the rules without  losing my job. New secure windows were . fixed and they had to find another way to communicate. ‘I . was often wired for sound when I entered his cell. When he offered to . make me coffee or started to chat, which was not allowed, I would make a . gesture to show we were being recorded. ‘We had a bond that way. I  wanted to help him, I liked him and believed in him, and for his part he wanted to help me.’ Christo was relieved for Mandela that he had died peacefully at  home. ‘His home and family meant everything to him,’ he says. Family ties: Zoleka is the daughter of Nelson Mandela's youngest child Zindzi, portrayed with him 2011 . ‘We talked a lot about those values, but I’ve watched him fading over the years. Now I’ll never hear  his voice again or see that bright  smile. Last time we met he teased me about my weight and said I should do more exercise.’ They also shared bleaker moments. Like Mandela, Christo suffered the loss of a son who died in a car  accident. ‘He was the first to call me and try to comfort me,’ he says. ‘Mandela always had time to show he cared, he was always concerned about family matters even when he had the great weight of State affairs to deal with.’ He says that Mandela would have enjoyed the scenes of dancing and singing in the streets that followed his death on Thursday evening. ‘I wish I could have seen all the love coming to him from all over the world.’ Christo has written his own life story around his relationship with Mandela, with the old man’s blessing and encouragement. Mandela – My Prisoner, My Friend, will be published next March. For the two of them it was the  natural continuation of a solid friendship, built in the grim surroundings of a maximum security prison and lasting well into the final years of Mandela’s long life. The black freedom fighter prepared to die to liberate his people from a cruel regime, and the  Afrikaans farm boy born into that same regime. ‘Through him I saw many human moments,’ Christo says. ‘That was our relationship, a series of small human moments that I now treasure more than ever.’ Today he still takes the ferry daily to Robben Island where he supervises supplies to the tourist shops and runs the busy cafeteria. Last Friday he described how the island felt empty now Mandela had gone. ‘I’ve always felt he was still here in spirit,’ he says. ‘I could still hear his voice sometimes and remembered all those painful times we shared when he was fighting for freedom and we were there to deprive him of it. ‘Now we’ll never see him here  ever again.’ play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video .","Christo Brand was a guard at Robben Island during Mandela's imprisonment .

"By . Anucyia Victor for MailOnline . Heading over to the States for a holiday? Be extra-attentive to the fine print at the hotel you're staying at, as fewer services now come for free. Charges such as £36 for welcome drinks, £6 ($15) to receive a package, and a £12 ($20) 'Urban Fee' for internet usage and newspapers could be hidden in the cost of a room. Hotels across America are expected to rake in a record £1.4bn ($2.25bn) in revenue from add-ons - a rise of 6 per cent on last year and nearly double a decade ago. Hidden costs: The Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino charges guests £4.80 to print their flight boarding pass . Beware the costs: The Hyatt Regency San Antonio charges guest £6 to £15 to receive a package . Fees only add an extra 2 per cent in revenue but the study by Bjorn Hanson, a professor at New York University's hospitality school, notes the majority of that money is pure profit. And now hotels are finding more and more inventive ways to charge guests for extra - with high-end resorts are also upping the price. For £392 ($650) a night, guests at the St Regis Bahia Beach Resort  in Puerto Rico enjoy rooms with 300-thread-count sheets and walk-in-closets. But that's not the full price. To add on to that, there's a £36 ($60) nightly resort charge, for a welcome drink upon check-in, internet access, the use of beach umbrellas and lounge chairs, bicycles and a daily poolside iced tea service that includes fruit skewers. Guests pay whether they use the services or not. The Fairmont Southampton in Bermuda, which charges £282 ($469) a night, adds a resort fee and mandatory gratuities for each person in a room. This means two adults and two children sharing a room would incur £29.12 ($48.28) a night in-resort fees and £24.61 ($40.80) tips - adding 19 per cent to the nightly rate. Perhaps nowhere are hotels pushing fees further than in Las Vegas. Resorts such as The Bellagio are learning from airlines and selling enhancements. Guests can pay £18 ($30) for each of the following - to skip the notoriously long Las Vegas check-in lines, for early check-in and for late checkout. And for an  £18 ($30), the Bellagio will lock in three room preferences such as bed type, requests to be near or far away from the elevators, rooms on a high or low floor or the option to have quieter non-connecting rooms. The Hyatt Regency San Antonio, which subcontracts its business centre to FedEx Office, charges £6 to £15 ($10 to $25) to receive a package, depending on weight. And some budget hotels charge 90p ($1.50) a night for in-room safes. At the Liberty Hotel in Boston a cold can of Coke from the minibar costs £3 ($5) – and that's just the base price. And the fine print on the menu reveals an 18 per cent administrative fee to restock the bar. The Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas charges £15 ($25) a day 'personal use fee' if a guest puts their own soda or bottled water in the minibar. A guest in need of a mini-refrigerator can have one delivered to their room – for an extra £21.11 ($35) a night. The Serrano hotel in downtown San Francisco adds on a £12 ($20) per night 'Urban Fee' that includes Internet, local phone calls, newspapers, morning coffee and use of bicycles. The American Hotel and Lodging Association says fees are common in the travel business and that its members disclose them at the time of booking. Enhancements: At The Bellagio guests can pay £18 ($30)  to skip the notoriously long Las Vegas check-in lines . The Fairmont Southampton in Bermuda charges £282 a night and adds  mandatory gratuities for each guest . The Serrano hotel in San Francisco adds on a £12 fee that includes Internet, morning coffee and use of bicycles . But convincing a front desk employee to waive a fee at check-out is getting harder. Fees are more established, better disclosed and hotel employees are now trained to politely say no. 'It's the most difficult it's ever been to get a charge removed,' Hanson says. Hotels first started adding surcharges in 1997 but as airlines and car rental agencies made fees commonplace, hotels started to think up new ones . And, according to Hanson's research, they have been collecting record amounts for the past four years. 'The airlines have done a really nice job of making hotel fees and surcharges seem reasonable,' says Hanson. But there are some hotels which are bucking the trend, although those are few and far between. Hyatt's upscale boutique Andaz chain offers complimentary local snacks and non-alcoholic drinks from its minibars. But the fee which takes the cake? That's the one Hank Phillippi Ryan, a mystery writer, faced. Before heading to the airport, she went to the lobby of the Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino to print her boarding pass. There a kiosk offered the service - for £4.80 ($7.95). 'I think I actually yelped,' she recalls. 'I had never seen that before.' Prepare . to shell out  £3 for a can of Coke at The Liberty Hotel.

"By . Joanna Blythman . After the horsemeat scandal of earlier this year, we now have the chicken fiasco, where major chains have been exposed for selling frozen chicken with shockingly high levels of added water. An investigation this week revealed that some chicken breasts on sale in the UK are made up of no less than 20 per cent water. What you think is a juicy chicken breast may in fact have been pumped full of water, either mechanically injected or through an industrial process known as tumbling — and what is worse, chemical additives are also added during the procedure. Additives: What you think is a juicy chicken breast may in fact have been pumped full of water, either mechanically injected or through an industrial process known as tumbling . The study highlighted one case of raw, frozen chicken breasts imported from Brazil into Britain and then sold in our supermarkets. While still in Brazil, salt and corn oil were added to the chicken breasts. Once in Britain, the breasts were thawed out and put through the vacuum-tumbling process. This saw water and chemical additives absorbed into the meat, increasing its weight and giving it a juicier, but wholly unnatural, texture. The breasts were then re-frozen and sold in the aisles of major retailers such as Aldi, Asda and Iceland. A curious double standard seems to be in operation here: home cooks are sternly warned never to re-freeze previously frozen meat, unless they have cooked it thoroughly. But behind the scenes of food manufacturing, frozen meat is being defrosted, pumped up with water and additives, then re-frozen all over again, and consumers are none the wiser. It is not illegal to add water and additives to chicken, as long as the additions are clearly displayed on the label. But the technical legalities are not the only issue here. There is also the unfairness of asking the public to pay more for a product than is justified. Many of us will feel cheated at the thought of having to pay for the added water, which works out at up to £1.54 a kilo. What’s more, these tumbled chicken breasts are a symbol of how heavily-industrialised, intensive production now dominates the food chain, robbing the public of the natural flavours and wholesome goodness that we ought to expect from a succulent chicken breast. What is particularly worrying is that we do not yet know the implications for our health, since there has been no in-depth analysis of the consequences of eating these adulterated meats. But it is hardly likely that eating chicken filled with water, salts, oil and additives will prove beneficial.As the GM controversy continues to demonstrate, working against nature is rarely a good idea. And that is precisely what is being done here. Normally, when meat is cooked, it loses liquid, but the meat processors are doing precisely the opposite, by actually pumping in fluids containing a cocktail of chemicals. ""Their art consists of taking a  pig’s ear — sometimes literally — and turning it into a profitable silk purse."" - Joanna Blythman . Though this week’s news has focused on chicken, the technique of adding water and additives is applied to a vast range of produce, including ham, bacon, frankfurters, sausages, turkey rolls, luncheon meat, sandwich fillers and ready meals. Indeed, almost any low-grade, mass-produced, frozen or  processed meat will have been treated this way. And it goes beyond meat. Even seafoods such as scallops are regularly soaked in water with phosphates to increase their size — though inevitably much of the taste is lost. The sheer number of foods that are adulterated in this way attests to the boundless creativity, advanced technology and cost-cutting zeal of the food processors. Their art consists of taking a  pig’s ear — sometimes literally — and turning it into a profitable silk purse. Their central objective is to make the meat or seafood absorb a significant quantity of water. The rationale is simple. Water is cheap and easy to source. Meat is much more expensive. The result of this process is inevitably that the customer ends up paying way over the odds for the water. The controversial process usually begins when the manufacturer acquires his supply of what is called ‘trim’, usually pieces of boned, frozen meat. His next task is to bulk out the trim by getting it to absorb water and additives. For this to happen, the manufacturer has to create a ‘brine’, a chemical solution that will encourage the meat to retain liquid using binding agents. These binding agents are usually from five main sources, which can be used separately or mixed together. The first is transglutaminase, an enzyme that is essentially a natural glue. Indeed, it is sometimes called ‘meat glue’. The second is from a group collectively known as hydrocolloids, substances that form a gel on contact with water. These hydrocolloids include carrageenan, which is derived from seaweed, as well as the exotically named locust bean gum — extracted from the seeds of the carob tree — and guar gum, which derives from ground guar beans. The third widely-used agent, especially in seafood, is phosphate, which is taken from phosphoric acid and is valued for its ability to make oil adhere to water. The fourth is fibre, made from a source such as wheat, citrus or cellulose. And the fifth is protein powder, which is made by extracting collagen from pigs’ skins. Protein powder comes in several different forms, such as pork pellets and broth powders — made from dehydrated, skimmed chicken stock. There is also a soya protein that tends to be made from genetically modified crops. Supermarkets: The breasts were then re-frozen and sold in the aisles of major retailers such as Aldi, Asda and Iceland . Once you know this, none of our mass-produced foodstuffs sound remotely appetising. But it gets worse, for the next task is to get the brine into the meat. This can be done in two ways. The first is through vacuum- tumbling, the method that has been in the news this week.The most common approach when it comes to vacuum-tumbling is for the meat to be placed with the brine in a machine that looks like a concrete mixer. The meat is then agitated as the mixer spins, the continual turning accelerating the absorption. The second method is the injection of the brine straight into the structure of the meat through a series of needles attached to an instrument that looks rather like a steel brush. One company has boasted that, through the injection method, 100 kilos of meat can be easily bulked up to a weight of 165 kilos with the addition of brine. It is no wonder that the manufacturers have so eagerly embraced all this tumbling and injecting.An internal brochure for the industry captures this enthusiasm, explaining that the process ‘transforms worthless cuts of meat with low value into standardised portions with a high added value’. In promoting this approach, the industry uses overblown language that extols the improvements brought about by the process. So processed meats are ‘easier to slice’ and feel ‘succulent but firm’. Each mouthful is ‘slightly resistant but juicy’. Other products are praised for their ‘cohesiveness’, as if that were a quality that the public actually look for in a piece of meat. ‘Mmmm, I really like this chicken breast, it’s so cohesive,’ they imagine us saying as we tuck into our dinner. That just shows how far the manufacturers have departed from reality. But it is all a huge con. Whatever language the manufacturers use, the public are getting neither value nor taste. This is not the way meat should be eaten. The ham we find in our petrol station sandwiches has the consistency of a limp handshake and all the flavour of an old tyre precisely because it has been through such a destructively intensive process, pumped up with water and held together by chemical gel. Those who suffer the most are those who eat in fast food restaurants and big institutions such as schools, hospitals and the British Army, where the needs of mass catering and limited budgets leave the managers vulnerable to the bulk merchants. Yet our reliance on ‘restructured’ and ‘reformed’ meats and chemical ‘emulsions’ is a false economy.This is not real, natural meat, but an industrialised meat-like substance. Eating cheap meat like this is a mug’s game — we may think we are getting a bargain, but we are paying through the nose for water and chemicals that can’t positively do us any good.","Investigation revealed some chicken breasts on sale are 20 per cent water .

The world-wide internet flash-mob gathering SantaCon, in which strangers agree to meet dressed as Father Christmas before hitting the streets for some festive fun, has been criticised in the past for some revellers getting a little carried away and heavy drinking.

"By . Harriet Hernando for MailOnline . Chips and gravy is a Northern favourite – so it’s no wonder the annual World Gravy Wrestling Championship in Lancashire is a popular event. Hundreds gathered in the village of Stacksteads, Lancashire, to grapple in around in 1,500 litres of the meaty sauce as temperatures dropped to a chilly 9C. The 14 men and six women fought to the bitter end as a referee oversaw the events – but that didn’t stop one competitor giving another a wedgie – caught on camera in this hilarious video. The gravy grapplers transformed into their fighting alter egos – including superman and a tiger – to compete at the Rose n Bowl pub, all in the name of charity. Now in its eighth year, the event raises around £3,000 annually for East Lancashire Hospice and attracts people from across the north west. Despite the chilly winds and threatening clouds above, the pub and grounds were filled with children, parents and the wrestlers’ supporters. Gravy bout: A man in a Union Jack flag takes out Oscar the Grouch from Sesame Street in the 2014 World Gravy Wrestling Championships in Lancashire . Splash! A woman dressed as an oompa loompa dived onto another in the gravy pool at the Rose N Bowl pub . One thousand litres of gravy were prepared in advance of the tournament and another 500 litres was needed to top up the pool throughout the match. Each match lasted two minutes and the winner was the competitor who entertained the audience the most. Fourteen wrestlers battled it out for the men’s title, while six women competed for their own crown. 'A bit of fun': Batman villain Bane celebrates his win in the gravy pit . Nice to meat you: Woman covered in gravy takes stock of the crowd that had gathered to watch the wrestling . Denise Gee, event fundraiser for East Lancashire Hospice, said: ‘This all started off as a bit of fun eight years ago, but it’s become the World Gravy Wrestling Championships and it’s now really well supported. ‘It raises a substantial amount for patient care - around £3,000 to £3,500 each year. ‘It’s a great day out and everyone has fun, but at the same time they raise money for the hospice.’ Red card: Karen Foster as Gravy Gaga at the World Gravy Wrestling Championship takes out the referee . Ms Gee, who took part in the wrestling dressed as Santa, said: ‘From personal experience, I can tell you it’s pretty sticky.’ As part of the fundraiser, the crowds were offered a chance to take part in a ‘gravy bucket challenge’ - an alternative to the popular ice bucket challenge.

"By . Rosie Taylor . Having one premature baby is nerve-wracking enough, but one mother is counting her blessings after she had three in 28 months – and all survived against the odds. Dance teacher Cassana Rason went into labour as early as 22 weeks with each of her children. The ordeal started when the 25-year-old’s waters broke while she was 35 weeks pregnant with her first child Leo, now six. Scroll down for video . Marvels: Children Chase (left), aged five, Sienna-Lilly (centre), aged four, and Leo (right), aged six . She went into hospital but a week of contractions later there was still no sign of the baby, meaning doctors were forced to perform a caesarean section. ‘It was my first baby and didn’t know what to expect,’ she said. ‘The doctor was saying “It is a bit too soon for the baby to be born”, and you think the worst.’ But after a few days of hospital treatment Leo, who was 6lb 2oz at birth, was ready to come home. Just three months later Mrs Rason fell pregnant again with second son Chase. Again her waters broke early – 11 weeks before her due date. After 38 hours of contractions, doctors had to perform another C-section. Chase was born weighing 3lb 6oz, just nine months and three weeks after Leo. Within a day his right lung had collapsed and doctors discovered a bleed on his brain. Leo was born at 36 weeks weighing 6lb 2oz. Picture shows Leo at two days old in 2007 . Chase born at 29 weeks weighing 3lb 6oz and Leo - 36 weeks weighing 6lb 2oz. Picture shows Chase at two weeks old in 2008 . Mrs Rason and her engineer husband Steven, 32, faced an anxious eight-week wait before Chase was well enough to come home and months before they knew whether the bleed had affected his cognitive ability. Happily, apart from seasonal asthma Chase, now five, is fit and well. ‘It was scary and we just had to sit tight,’ she said. ‘But looking back we could have been in a very different position. Chase is fine, he is very athletic and doing well at school.’ A year after Chase was born, Mrs Rason discovered she was pregnant again. Sienna-Lilly born at 23 weeks weighing 2lb 3oz. Picture shows Sienna-Lilly at 12 hours old in 2009 . Full of beans: Chase, Sienna-Lilly and Leo . But at just 22 weeks – 18 weeks before she was due – her waters broke and contractions started.She was immediately taken to hospital where doctors warned the longer she could keep the baby the greater chance it had of being healthy. Mrs Rason was medicated to stop her from giving birth for five weeks. But she continued to have painful contractions at least every 20 minutes. ‘Towards the end I was passing out with the pain,’ she said. ‘After five weeks the doctors decided the extent of the stress on my body meant it was time to start delivery. They said “You need to get that baby out now”.’ Steve and Cassana Rason and their three children, Chase(left), Leo(right) and Sienna-Lilly (seated centre) at their home in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire . Sienna-Lilly was born 13 weeks early, weighing just 2lb 3oz. She had four holes in her bowel and had to undergo life-saving surgery to have her large bowel removed. But she is now a happy, healthy four-year-old who can ‘eat for England’. Mrs Rason of Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, remains astonished at the resilience of her three children. ‘They are a little inspiration all three of them, they are amazing,’ she said. Doctors still do not know why she went into labour early or why her contractions did not lead to natural births. She also suffered postnatal depression which started at the time Chase would have been due. ‘Most mothers of premature babies feel responsible for not carrying them long enough,’ she said. ‘You have this massive guilt for what your baby went through. I felt I was responsible for him being poorly.’ And once her children were all safely at home, she began having panic attacks as a delayed reaction to her experiences. Her husband, who she describes as ‘a rock who held it together for me’, also suffered with post-traumatic stress. ‘It is only recently we have started to get a life back for us all,’ Mrs Rason said. The couple have decided not to have any more children. Mrs Rason, a former songwriter, volunteers for premature baby charity BLISS and has penned and recorded a charity single Tiny Hands inspired by her children which is available now on iTunes or as a CD at bliss.org.uk/shop.","Cassana Rason has had three premature babies .

"Who do Britons dream of sitting next to at 30,000feet? The royal family, David Beckham and George Clooney top the list according to a new survey commissioned by London City Airport. Kate Middleton proved the favourite royal of those questioned, followed by Prince Harry, whose potential for in-flight banter was no doubt what pipped his brother Prince William to the post for second place. The Queen herself came in third. 13.5% of people would most like to fly alongside the royal family, with Kate Middleton in the number one spot and Prince William in third place . A host of celebrities fill the remainder of the top ten famous faces that would fill a fantasy flight. A-list stars of days gone by, including Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley featured highly stealing more than 12 per cent of the vote each, while Winston Churchill shared fourth place with the very much alive David Beckham, who won 11.1% of the vote. Swoon in the sky: 7% of passengers asked would like to fly next to Johnny Depp, making him the 9th most popular celebrity, while 6.5% put George Clooney in 10th place . Johnny Depp and George Clooney, who were in ninth and tenth place, with 7% and 6.5% of the vote respectively, also made the grade. And passengers who don't win any friends in the skies? A bad smell is the least attractive quality to British people with 48.2% of those surveyed citing a companion’s bad body odour as their number one gripe. However, it seems us Brits are the least concerned about a stinky seatmate when it comes to our European cousins. 70% of Swiss participants admit they can’t bear BO along with 64% for the Spanish, 61% of Italians and 53% of Irish passengers. It’s no great shock that notoriously prudish Britons list canoodling as an in-flight annoyance with 5.2% of people saying they wouldn’t like to sit next to an amorous couple on an aeroplane. Surprisingly though, passion-loving Italians are with us on that one, with 5% saying no way to wandering hands in the next seat, while the Swiss and Spanish remain non-plussed by in-flight naughtiness. It wasn't just today's celebrities who were on the top ten fantasy passenger list: Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley made it on there along with Nelson Mandela and Winston Churchill . Unsurprisingly, most people asked were reasonably irked by children kicking the back of their seat, but it’s the British and Irish who have the least tolerance with as many as 20% and 27% respectively expressing a dislike of children putting the boot in. If you do find yourself travelling with a child, perhaps hope to sit them behind someone Swiss, as they were the least bothered with only 11% complaining. ‘When 30,000ft up in the sky, we get pretty up close and personal with our fellow passengers and if you’re sitting next to somebody you’re not keen on it can make for a long flight’, a spokesperson for London City Airport, which commissioned the survey, said. ‘Consider those around you, make sure you’re smelling fresh, don’t fall asleep and keep chewing to a minimum,' was the sage advice offered.","Kate Middleton tops Brits' list of ideal celebrity flight companions .

"By . Emily Payne for MailOnline . The airport scanners that caused controversy when it was revealed that they produced near naked images of travellers have come under fire again as researchers have found they also failed to detect concealed weapons. Researchers from top US universities suggest that the Rapiscan  full-body scanner can be fooled by covering forbidden items with plastic sheets and under clothing. The findings, which are to be announced at the Usenix security conference in San Diego, also suggest that the scanner's software can be hacked to present images at certain angles or to cover up certain sections of the body in ways that would be undetectable, the research scientists said. Scroll down for video . Professor Hovav Shacham, one of the lead researchers, pictured with with the Secure 1000 scanner . America's Transportation Safety Administration stopped using the scanner last year, after four years, following a public outcry that the machine produced what amounted to naked pictures of passengers. However, the scanners are still in operation at some government facilities such as prisons, as well as airports in Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya. The study's authors say that the original approval of the scanners casts doubt over the TSA's process for evaluating the technology it currently uses. The American authorities spent £600million ($1billion) installing them at 160 airports before they were finally removed last year. An image produced by the Rapiscan Secure 1000 full-body scanner. The red circle indicates where a handgun was tucked into this subject’s waistband. One of the study's lead authors, Alex Halderman, said: 'These machines were tested in secret, presumably without this kind of adversarial mindset, thinking about how an attacker would adapt to the techniques being used.' 'They might stop a naive attacker. But someone who applied just a bit of cleverness to the problem would be able to bypass them. And if they had access to a machine to test their attacks, they could render their ability to detect contraband virtually useless.' The team of researchers conducted their tests on an Rapiscan Secure 1000 system they purchased on eBay. While the scanners are no longer in use at major airports, they are still in operation at some government facilities such as prisons, as well as airports in Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya . Many airports still use other devices by Rapiscan, including machines that scan carry-on luggage.They found  that a metal gun taped to the side of a person's body, or sewn into a trouser leg could be concealed. On its website, Rapiscan says: 'Deployed and tested in airports, as well as by law enforcement, homeland security and military organizations worldwide, Rapiscan Systems’ family of Secure 1000 personnel screening products are the most proven, widely used and accepted advanced whole body imaging systems available today.

'The Secure 1000 can reveal threats concealed on a person’s body that other technologies, such as metal detectors, cannot. 'The Secure 1000 can reveal even very small quantities of liquid explosives, non-metallic weapons, and plastic explosives, making it ideal for aviation security applications.' A spokesman for the TSA said the technology they use undergoes 'a rigorous testing and evaluation process, along with certification and accreditation.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron today faced claims the government caved in to pressure from the drinks industry to ditch plans to impose minimum alcohol pricing. Ministers met drinks firms, trade bodies and supermarkets dozens of times before dropping the policy last year. Tory MP Sarah Wollaston said condemned the ‘shabby truth’ which had emerged while Labour accused the Prime Minister of ‘cosying up to vested interests’. Downing Street had championed the idea of setting a minimum price at which alcohol could be sold, but it was dropped last year . The Home Office carried out a consultation on a 45p minimum unit price which would mean a can of strong lager could not be sold for less than £1.56 and a bottle of wine for less than £4.22. But the Government shelved its plans to set a minimum per-unit price for alcohol last summer, even though it had been championed by Mr Cameron. It sparked claims that he had been influenced by his party's election strategist, Australian lobbyist Lynton Crosby, whose firm is reported to have represented drinks giants. An investigation by the British Medical Journal showed how ministers at the Department of Health, the Treasury and Home Office met with the alcohol industry numerous times while the policy was being consulted on. It even included Chancellor George Osborne having a beer named after him by a group lobbying for minimum alcohol pricing to be dropped. David Cameron has faced claims of caving into pressure from the drinks industry . The Department of Health held regular meetings with representatives from the drinks industry. It included two meetings after the official public consultation on minimum pricing had ended. A report by Sheffield University which found evidence that forcing the price of alcohol up would reduce crime and prevent deaths was also never released to the public. Labour’s shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘Once again, David Cameron has been found out cosying up to vested interests and standing up for the wrong people. It has become a hallmark of his Government. ‘Public health policy is in utter disarray. After the tobacco industry last year, these revelations raise yet more concerns about the influence of big business on this Government’s policies. ‘The Prime Minister once promised action on a minimum alcohol price but in government has been more interested in listening to lobbyists and vested interests than ordinary people.’ Dr Wollaston, a GP elected for the Conservatives in 2010, said it revealed ‘the shabby truth about the ditching of minimum pricing’ adding it is a ‘disgrace’ that the Sheffield University study was ‘supressed’. A group of 22 health professionals including Sir Ian Gilmore, special adviser on alcohol at the Royal College of Physicians, accused the Government of ‘deplorable practices’. They said: ‘Today, the public learns of the deplorable practices that were instrumental in the Government's decision to reverse its commitment to save thousands of lives by implementing a minimum unit price for alcohol. ‘An investigation conducted by the British Medical Journal shows that ministers met drinks industry representatives to discuss alternative measures to minimum pricing at a time when the principle of this policy was not up for public debate. ‘We call on the Government to stop dancing to the tune of the drinks industry and prioritise public health,’ they wrote in a letter to the Daily Telegraph. Write caption here . Public health minister Jane Ellison said government had to ‘weigh lots of things in the balance’. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘I know that many public health experts feel very strongly about this policy but we also had to weigh up the impact it would have on low income households, the impact it would have on people drinking responsibly. ‘Wider government has to take these things into consideration. On the health issue this idea of the 130 meetings, many of the public health experts were in those meetings.’ She added: ‘We are not proceeding at the moment, that was the conclusion of the consultation, that was what the Government said.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Minimum unit pricing is still under consideration. ‘As you would expect from a government department seeking to effect public health change through a voluntary deal with industry, a wide group of officials have many different meetings with a vast range of stakeholders, and we utterly reject the allegation of anything untoward in the small proportion of those that took place with the alcohol industry.’","Prime Minister had championed setting minimum unit cost price .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . He is the comedian who puts his success down to his working class background. Growing up on a 1960s council estate, says John Bishop, helped shape his sense of humour. Now, however, he appears to have outgrown his humble roots. For home these days is a ten-bedroom mansion surrounded by 24 acres of landscaped lawns he purchased for £2.25million last year. Scroll down for video . Despite being only a few miles from his childhood home in rural Cheshire, the impressive property boasts an inside swimming pool, tennis court and lake with an accompanying island. All a far cry from the three-bedroom council property he grew up in. His new family home is the result of his remarkable rise from circuit stand-up comedian to household star who has made millions of pounds through TV appearances, sold-out stadium tours and impressive DVD sales. According to his company’s financial reports, Bishop, 47, and his wife Melanie are worth more than £5.5million, with the bulk of their fortune being made in the past two years. Childhood home: The comic's previous family home is a far cry from the luxuries Bishop now enjoys . Bishop’s autobiography How Did All This Happen? has also stormed the bestseller charts with more than 93,000 hardback copies sold since last year. In the book the BBC star describes how he keeps his feet firmly on the ground with the help of a reminder of his less luxurious start in life: The street sign from where he grew up. He describes how his brother Eddie ‘nicked’ the Severn Walk sign from the 1960s estate and presented it to him before a gig with the message: ‘So you don’t forget where you are from.’ Together: Bishop with his wife Melanie last year. The two briefly split but have reconciled . Bishop says the sign ‘now hangs in my kitchen, in pride of place’. He adds: ‘You can’t return to your childhood, but you don’t have to leave it, either.’ He moved to the end-terrace house in the 1960s while still a toddler after his family home in Liverpool, which his father bought off a friend in the pub for £50, was knocked down as part of a slum clearance scheme. He says playing football in the council estate is his earliest memory and has helped define him, along with his sense of humour. Having made his success, Bishop adds he is keen to remain living in Cheshire and not make the move to London. He said in a recent interview: ‘There are socialist elements ingrained in you if you’ve grown up on a council estate; it’s something I’m proud of. But I also don’t feel you should apologise for your success if you have managed to move on to good things. ‘I can’t see any reason to leave. It’s never crossed my mind. I think that if you live in the North of England you are a very, very lucky person. I can’t see myself in Primrose Hill drinking cappuccinos. This is where I belong.’ Bishop gave up his successful job as a pharmaceutical salesman to concentrate on comedy in 2006. He briefly split from his wife Melanie, with whom he has three sons – Joe, 19, Luke, 17, and Daniel, 15 – before reconciling through counselling. He found fame through the BBC’s Live At The Apollo series in 2009 before appearing in the BBC’s John Bishop’s Britain, John Bishop’s Big Year and the drama series Accused. More than 300,000 people saw his last tour and his television audiences for his comedy shows have topped 6.5million. He also raised more than £3.4million for the BBC’s Sport Relief charity by carrying out a week-long triathlon as well as rowing the Channel and running from Dover to London.","The comic bought £2.25m mansion in rural Cheshire last year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A luxurious Caribbean cruise is meant to be the trip of a lifetime. But for the passengers on board one ship, the dream rapidly turned into a nightmare – when 281 of them became violently ill. Twenty-two crew members are also battling severe stomach upsets after illness tore through the Royal Caribbean cruise ship Explorer of the Seas. It has now been forced to skip a planned trip to Haiti and dock in Puerto Rico so that it can undergo an extensive sanitising process. One furious passenger told CNN: 'I'll never come back again.

The Explorer of the Seas made a port of call in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, after stopping for an 'extensive sanitation' in Puerto Rico . Some 281 passengers and 22 crew members exhibited symptoms of norovirus, an extremely contagious and potentially deadly stomach virus that can cause violent vomiting and diarrhea, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The Explorer of the Seas carries 1,165 crew members on board. This is the second time in a month that a Royal Caribbean cruise has been derailed by norovirus. On January 18, the Majesty of the Sea was forced to cut its four day voyage from Miami short after 66 passengers fell ill. Once it became clear that something . was amiss, Royal Caribbean decided to have the boat skip a planned stop . in Haiti and proceed on to San Juan, Puerto Rico where it 'underwent an . extensive sanitizing.' Bad trip: More than 300 people aboard the Explorer of the Seas cruise ship have fallen ill . Making history: The incident was one the largest norovirus outbreaks on a cruise ship in the past 20 years.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It has been a bad start to the Super Bowl weekend for Justin Bieber after his private jet was held at a New Jersey airport for several hours and his custom-made car was towed. Police searched the private jet, which 'smelled of pot', after Bieber and his father landed at Teterboro airport yesterday with a posse of the 19-year-old's friends. There was further drama for the singer this morning as his chrome-plated Fisker Karma sports car was seen being towed from his Calabasas home in California. Scroll down for video .

Search: Police search a private jet hired by Bieber after it landed at a New Jersey airport . With two pending criminal cases - driving under the influence in Miami and allegedly assaulting a limo driver in Toronto - customs officials decided to stop Bieber as he arrived in New Jersey, TMZ reported. No drugs were found and the singer and his entourage, who had arrived at about 2.50pm were allowed to leave the airport on Friday evening. The singer’s representatives have not yet responded to a Mail Online request for further comment. Bieber was questioned for five hours being being released, and the private jet he had hired was searched by sniffer dogs, after police detected a smell of marijuana. 'He came in, the jet smelled like weed ... because of the Super Bowl they’re doing more security checks,' an airport source told the New York Post. It is not yet clear why his distinctive car was being towed from his California home. Entourage: Bieber's father, Jeremy, is spotted in an SUV in New York with a mystery blonde . Bieber ducks down behind his security guards as he leaves the Maxim Super Bowl party in the early hours of Saturday . The delays at the airport appeared to have little effect on the singer, who was spotted being mobbed by young fans when he arrived at a New York hotel on Friday night. And, at 2am the young singer was at a Maxim Super Bowl party, which was filled with models and scantily clad women dancing on raised platforms. After being escorted in through a back entrance, Bieber was taken to a roped off private table where his security guards kept a close watch. Anytime a party-goer tried to grab a picture of the singer, a bodyguard would block their way or knock the phone or camera from their hand, according to People. A few photos did emerge of the singer however. In one he is seen making a rude gesture while standing on a platform at the end of the room, while young women dance below him. Party-goers described his security as being aggressive, claiming they elbowed people out of the way as Bieber walked through the club, and shone torches in the eyes of anyone trying to take a photo. As a photo of Bieber making a rude gesture at a camera was featured on TMZ another damning photo emerged showing the teen pop sensation and his friend sucking the nipples of a busty stripper in a Los Angeles recording studio.

TMZ reported that an alleged fight with a limo driver began when Bieber asked for the music to be turned up. The . driver obliged, but not as much as Bieber was hoping, so he apparently . stuck his hand through the partition to do it himself. It is claimed that the . driver swatted his hand away and then it errupted into a full-on smack . fest as Bieber then hit the driver in the head multiple times. He already faces a charge of driving under the influence after getting caught drag racing in Miami. Bieber has pleaded not guilty to DUI, resisting arrest without violence and driving without a valid license in the Miami case. A . preliminary toxicology report released Thursday showed that he tested . positive for marijuana and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax. Bieber told Florida . police after the arrest that he had been smoking marijuana and had taken . a prescription drug, saying that his mother gave him the medication. False alarm: A police search found nothing suspicious and the popstar and his pals were free to go, however, the FAA launched an investigation into their actions, which today came back with all parties being cleared of any wrongdoing . Bad week: Bieber was arrested for DUI in Miami on January 23 (pictured) after being stopped by police in a rented Lamborghini . His father was with him while they were in Florida and was at his side in Canada on Wednesday. Late Thursday, Bieber posted a photo of his father, Jeremy, with a praise-filled caption.

"By . John Hall . Officers have paid an emotional tribute to police dog that was stabbed to death by a convicted sex offender he was helping to arrest. Several police staff saluted the flag-covered casket containing the body of Rocco, an eight-year-old German Shepherd who was fatally wounded while officers attempted to arrest John Rush in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia on Tuesday evening. Rocco fought for his life for two days following the stabbing, before eventually succumbing to blood loss and pneumonia last night, with the Mayor of Pittsburgh ordering all flags in the city to be flown at half-mast as the news broke. Final farewell: Officers pay an emotional tribute to police dog Rocco, who was stabbed to death by a criminal he was helping to arrest. The Mayor of Pittsburgh has ordered all flags in the city to be flown at half-mast . Rocco was said to have fought 'a good fight' in the days after his stabbing, and his condition was initially thought to be improving, but as he deteriorated over the course of yesterday afternoon, officers arrived at the Pittsburgh Veterinary Specialty & Emergency Center to say their last goodbyes. 'He fought as hard here as he did out on the field,' staff surgeon Julie Compton told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. As it became clear Rocco would not last the night, police canine units from across the city made a slow process towards the clinic, flashing their lights in tribute to their dying colleague. One retired police dog handler played a bagpipe salute as Rocco's death was announced, while serving officers standing with their dogs in the street outside the clinic presented arms. Rocco was reportedly stabbed by a convicted sex offender as officers attempted to arrest him . Rocco was reportedly stabbed by 21-year-old convicted sex offender John Rush as officers attempted to arrest him on Tuesday afternoon. Rocco and his handler, Officer Phil Lerza, had been called to the scene after reports that homeless Rush was behaving suspiciously outside a basement entrance to a building on Butler Street in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville neighbourhood. When Officer Lerza asked for the man's name and identification, Rush is said to have lunged for the officer's gun and then punched him in the face before running off. Officer Lerza attempted to stop Rush escaping by using a Taser, but he made off into a basement home in 3700 Block on Butler Street. As Rocco,his handler and three other officers made their way into the building, Rush allegedly jumped out from behind a pillar wielding a knife. Rush is said to have lunged at the group, swinging the knife as Rocco bravely bit onto his arm in an attempt to bring him under control. During the struggle, Officer Daniel Novak and Officer John Baker were punched several times in the head, while Officer Lanza suffered a non-serious puncture wound to his back, and a fourth officer suffered a knee injury. But it was Rocco who bore the brunt of Rush's alleged rampage, suffering a three-inch stab wound to his side that penetrated muscle and a kidney, and caused extensive blood loss. Crime scene: Rocco was stabbed to death in a basement home in 3700 Block on Butler Street, Pittsburgh . Rush now faces felony charges of abusing a police animal, disarming a law enforcement officer, aggravated assault, burglary and misdemeanor charges of animal cruelty, resisting arrest and possessing instruments of a crime. He is being held without bond in the Allegheny County Jail. A police spokesperson said dogs serving in the Pittsburgh police force are provided with protective vests, but they are not always deemed practical dogs wearing them can easily overheat. They also take several minutes to put on, so when a situation rapidly and unexpectedly escalates, as in the arrest of Rush, there is not always time to use one.","Officers gather outside Pittsburgh veterinary clinic to pay final respects .

"By . Simon Walters And Glen Owen . The row over the Tory MP who attended a Nazi-themed stag night intensified last night after party chairman Grant Shapps was forced to intervene – and admitted that Aidan Burley had given a version of events that ‘conflicted’ with The Mail on Sunday’s  eye witness account. Despite condemnation of Mr Burley’s actions, Mr Shapps refused to reopen the inquiry into the events at a French ski resort. Mr Burley resigned as a ministerial aide after admitting ‘clearly inappropriate behaviour’ at the 2011 stag do, where revellers, including the groom, Mark Fournier, in a Nazi  uniform, chanted pro-Hitler slogans and gave Nazi salutes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Proof: MP Aidan Burley (far right) leaves the Val Thorens pub with pal Mark Fourmier dressed in SS uniform . Last week, we published a photo of Mr Burley at the Frog & Roastbeef in Val Thorens – exposing as a lie his testimony to a party investigation that he had not been present when friends chanted ‘Hitler’ and ‘Himmler’. We also published the transcript of a tape recording made by our reporter in the pub, in which – against a backdrop of Nazi chants – a member of Mr Burley’s group identifies him as MP for Cannock Chase in Staffordshire. Mr Burley can also be heard. However, in a letter to The Mail on Sunday, Mr Shapps insists: ‘While you have highlighted a conflict around the factual account of the precise events of the evening, this conflict does not impact on the report’s substantial conclusion’ – that Mr Burley had not been motivated by racism or anti-Semitism. Fancy dress: Jodie Jones poses with a man in German uniform and another in Middle Eastern garb in 2009 . Top level: Aidan Burley introduces his fiancée to David Cameron at a Downing Street reception in 2012 . His stonewalling came as a photo emerged . of Mr Burley’s fiancée, Jodie Jones standing next to a man dressed in a . German uniform. Ms Jones has been chair of the Cannock Chase . Conservative Association, which offered the MP its full backing last . Monday. Last week, Miss Jones was seen in the House of Commons with Mr Burley. When approached, the  couple declined to comment. The photo came as Stephen Pollard, . editor of The Jewish Chronicle, criticised the Tories’ handling of the . case as ‘so bizarre it raises even more serious questions than what . happened at the stag do’. Mr . Pollard pointed out that Lord Gold, author of the party’s inquiry, . failed to look at evidence compiled by the MoS: ‘He appears simply to . have taken Mr Burley’s word for it.’ Critics have blasted Lord Gold, (right) author of the party's inquiry, for not consulting The Mail on Sunday's findings including transcripts of Nazi chants as he is identified. But Grant Shapps (left) refuses to probe further . Last night, Mr Burley insisted he had told the truth to Lord Gold’s inquiry, and said he stood by his claim that Mr Fournier had given a Nazi salute at the behest of MoS reporter, Matt Sandy, and photographer, John McLellan. Both men stress this is completely untrue. No10 declined to comment further. by NICK CRAVEN . Shamed Tory MP Aidan Burley faced fresh embarrassment last night after a photograph emerged  of his fiancée standing next to a  man in what appears to be a German military uniform. Jodie Jones – who is also the MP’s constituency office manager – can be seen wearing a Catwoman mask and low-cut top, flanked by a man apparently dressed as a German  soldier and another in Middle Eastern dress. Other photographs show her as a St Trinian’s schoolgirl draped provocatively over a pool table and in a second kissing a female friend. Provocative: Miss Jones - dressed as a St Trinian's schoolgirl - drapes herself over a university pool table . They emerged as it was revealed that Miss Jones once chaired the association which gave her fiancé its full backing after he was exposed as a liar by The Mail on Sunday. On Monday, Cannock Chase Conservative Association issued a  statement in favour of Mr Burley – without attempting to explain the glaring inconsistencies in his account surrounding a Nazi-themed stag do he attended in 2011. But there was confusion last  night as to the role 25-year-old Tory councillor Miss Jones played in the decision. She insisted to The Mail on Sunday that she had resigned ‘prior to the meeting’ and had had no part in the final outcome. However, she declined to say why she had resigned from her post. At the same time, neither she nor Mr Burley corrected a local newspaper report on Thursday, three days after the meeting, naming her as chairman of the Cannock Chase Conservative Association. Bikini girl: Jodie Jones wears a pink bra top as she parties with a male pal in another photo from Facebook . Last night, other sources in the Association said Miss Jones was still the chairman – and that they were unaware she had resigned. Chris Anslow, a Cannock Chase district councillor, confirmed she was still the chairman. ‘At the moment, it’s Jodie Jones,’ he said. However, he revealed that was about to change at the association’s annual general meeting later this month. ‘It’s just in the process (of changing),’ he said. Ms Jones said that the photograph  of her as Catwoman had been taken at a party in Western Australia in 2009, and that she did not know either of the men. The pictures were among those Miss Jones allowed to be released to the media two years ago when she was billed ‘Britain’s sexiest councillor’. Many of them appear to have  been taken when she was a politics and history student at Magdalen College, Oxford. In one, she is seen vampishly dressed and kissing a female friend, while in another she is pictured in a bikini at a ‘beach party’ with a male companion. Elsewhere, she is photographed after her final exams sitting on the ground, swigging from two bottles of wine. In something of a contrast, she is then seen more sombrely attired, meeting David Cameron, with Mr Burley at her side. References to the war or Germany are especially sensitive around  Cannock Chase because the area  is the site of the biggest single cemetery for German and Austrian POWs, and civilian internees from both world wars. The 5,000 or so graves are maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. In an email yesterday, Miss Jones said: ‘I formally resigned as Chairman of Cannock Chase Conservative Association, in writing to the Association President, prior to last week’s meeting. The meeting was called without my involvement, I did not attend the meeting. ‘I have had no other contact with the . Association Executive in the  last week, and had no sight of the . Association’s statement before it was released. There was therefore no . conflict of interest at all.’ Floored: Celebrating her final exams at university, Miss Jones is pictured lying on the floor clutching bottles . The Association’s statement said: ‘Senior Councillors and members of the Cannock Chase Conservative Association have given their full backing to local MP, Aidan Burley, following a meeting held on Monday 27 January, at which recent allegations were discussed. ‘At the meeting, Aidan made it clear that he had told the whole truth in every aspect to the internal Conservative Party inquiry conducted by Lord Gold.’ The statement also carried  supportive comments from members of the community, including former heavyweight boxer turned entrepreneur, Scott Murray. He said: ‘Aidan… made a mistake two years ago, has apologised and paid the price.’ Firm friends: Cannock Chase Conservative Association chair Miss Jones, right, enjoys a kiss with a girl pal . Miss Jones first arrived in Cannock soon after graduating from Oxford in 2009. She became a councillor in 2011, aged only 22. At the time, she said in an interview: ‘I’ve have always been quite opinionated, and this [being a councillor] gives me a chance to have a say on the things that are important to me. ‘I don’t have any time for a boyfriend – I will probably be able to one day, but for now I have enough responsibilities with my job. ‘It gives me a chance to make sure things get done. ‘I definitely see myself in Parliament one day, and who knows  what might happen, I won’t rule anything out – I could be Prime Minister one day.’ Last year, following Mr Burley’s split from TV fashion presenter and stylist Helen Boyle, 34 Miss Jones emerged as his new consort and fiancée.","Aidan Burley MP let off despite giving 'conflicted version of events'

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Kate Moss, who enjoys trips to the party isle is campaigning against oil drilling off it's Mediterranean coast . The Spanish government has picked a fight with some of the world’s most glamorous celebrities after giving permission for an oil company to start prospecting off the coast of Ibiza. Residents and regular visitors to the ‘party island’, such as Jade Jagger, Kate Moss, Sienna Miller and heiress Paris Hilton have all added their weight to stop the drilling. The campaign has gathered momentum on social networking sites with each tweeting to their millions of followers. Rapper P Diddy sent a picture of the campaign poster to his 9.5million followers and Miss Hilton has tweeted it six times to her 12.5million. Miss Moss, who recently celebrated her 40th birthday, has signed a petition and sent it to her friends, while Miss Jagger is believed to be masterminding the resistance from a work trip in India. In 2011 the Spanish government invited energy companies to bid for the right to explore an area less than a square mile off the coast of Valencia in order to drill for oil. It claims the lease was granted to Cairn Energy by the previous administration and reversing the decision would mean a heft compensation claim from the company. But protesters claim compensation would not have to be paid if it was proven the plan was environmentally unsound. Jade Jagger (left) and Sienna Miller (right) are also signing the petition to block oil exploration in the Med . The Spanish government has said it is too costly to axe the lease for Cairn Energy to look for deposits . Singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, who is supporting the campaign, said: ‘I know Ibiza is perceived as a party island but this isn’t just a social issue; it’s environmental, and on our conscience if we don’t act. ‘Now it’s time for us to say enough is enough.’ Cairn Energy, which is understood to be taking seismic measurements from a Cairn Energy, which is understood to be taking seismic measurements from a boat, declined to comment.","Cairn Energy has been given a lease to look for oil near the island .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Emily Davies . Nick Clegg today brushed aside claims the government sold the Royal Mail on the cheap, insisting Vince Cable who was put in charge ‘is not a sort of share price expert’. It came after the revelation that the firm’s privatisation at a knock down price cost the taxpayer £1billion, worth £55 for every family in Britain . .Amid growing concerns shares were sold too cheaply, Freedom of Information requests revealed that 21 banks pitching to work on the floatation had valued the Royal Mail from £4bn to £4.8bn - well above the eventual sale price of £3.3bilion. Sold too low: 21 banks pitching to work on the floatation had valued the Royal Mail from £4bn to £4.8bn - well above the eventual sale price of £3.3bilion . It . means the 60 per cent stake sold by Mr Cable, the Business Secretary, raised £2billion, . instead of the £2.9billion he was told he could have secured for the . taxpayer. The . new figures prompted fresh accusations that the UK’s historic postal . service was privatised too cheaply at the taxpayer’s expense during a . period of unprecedented austerity. Chuka . Umunna, Labour’s shadow business secretary who unearthed them, said the . government’s failure to get a fair price for Royal Mail had ‘left . taxpayers short-changed’. But Mr Clegg leapt to his Lib Dem colleague's defence. Speaking on his LBC 97.3 phone-in, the Deputy Prime Minister said: 'Vince is not a sort of share price expert. He is the Secretary of State who is responsible for this who I think very bravely did something... ‘What I dispute is this idea that somehow Vince Cable single handedly plucked some arbitrary price out of thin air. He didn’t. They did it following advice. ‘It’s clearly an imprecise, unpredictable science. It is a good thing that this company is now being valued as a very good, strong company because that’s vital. ‘Any government when selling a company like that, floating a company like that has got to take independent advice. That is what we’ve done and that is what the Secretary of State, in this case, Vince Cable, did.’ The . government floated 60 per cent of Royal Mail in October at 330p a . share, valuing it at £3.3bn and raising almost £2bn for the public . purse. Shares went up by more than a third on the first day of trading alone, and broke through the 550p mark within a week. Business . Secretary Mr Cable tried to suggest that the price increase was mere . ‘froth’, but yesterday the shares were still being traded at 585p. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who was presented with a portrait of himself during his LBC phone-in, insisted Vince Cable was not a share price expert but listened to advice . A report into the sale process of the Royal Mail is expected to be published by the Commons business select committee in the next few weeks and the National Audit Office is also investigating. The new figures support previous claims the sale was ‘catastrophically’ undervalued. Conservative think tank The Bow Group suggested in November taxpayers might have lost out.It accused ministers of masterminding a privatisation that ‘robbed the taxpayer’ and said shares had been undervalued possibly by as much as £1billion. Ben Harris-Quinney, chairman of the group, said at the time: ‘You can sell £10 notes for £5 all day long and call it a success. But this is robbing the overtaxed Brit in a short-sighted fire sale of a valuable national asset. There are currently restrictions in place on further sales of the remaining 30 per cent of shares, 10 per cent having been given to Royal Mail staff. The remainder of the shares are likely to be sold in tranches after April when the restrictions are lifted. Chuka Umunna said the government's failure to get a fair price 'left taxpayers short-changed' The figures show that in May 2013 top-end valuations were as high as £8.7 billion. But by the autumn, after research was completed into investor demand, amid threats of Royal Mail strikes and fears of a US debt default, several experts told select committee hearings these ‘desk-top valuations’ could not be compared. But estimates were still markedly higher than the eventual share price of 330p. Goldman Sachs and UBS, the lead banks in the floatation, said that was the maximum that institutional investors would pay without starting to drop out. Even so, ministers and advisers considered raising the price by 20p in the days before the flotation, but feared it would put the sale at risk of failure. Business Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'We carried out a successful sale that secured almost £2bn for the taxpayer and longterm investors in Royal Mail. We still own a 30 per cent stake in the company and the subsequent rise in the trading price of shares in Royal Mail ensures that taxpayers continue to benefit from any strengthening in the share price.' At Prime Minister’s questions earlier this week, Mr Cameron said the government 'did a good job to get private sector capital into Royal Mail'. Last night Mr Umunna said the PM had 'serious questions to answer about why his government sold off Royal Mail on the cheap'.","21 banks pitching to work on Royal Mail floatation put value over £4billion .

"By . Meghan Keneally . and Associated Press . The U.S. ambassador to Russia has announced that he is stepping down after two turbulent years in Moscow. Michael McFaul, a longtime Stanford University professor-turned-diplomat, will be returning to California, following his family who moved back to their home state last year. 'We tried to make a 9,000 kilometer commute work for our family. But after seven months of separation, I simply need to be with my family again,' he said in a statement. Leaving: Michael McFaul, a former professor, said that he always planned to leave academia for only two years and now he is at the five-year mark . The ambassador announced his departure in a blog post on Tuesday, saying he would leave after the Sochi Winter Olympics. Mr McFaul, 50, is considered the architect of President Barack Obama's effort to reset relations with Russia. Though U.S.-Russian relations are the iciest over the past two years as they have been since the Cold War, but Mr McFaul defended his time as a diplomat. Even Mr McFaul did not try to smooth over the troublesome years, presenting a laundry list of problems that have arisen between the two countries- and placing the blame for each squarely in Russia's corner. 'I also am proud of the work we had to do to manage some difficult issues in U.S.-Russia relations over the past few years,' he wrote in a blog post Tuesday. Tense: McFaul's term marked a rising sense of anti-Americanism, and also coincided with the return of Vladimir Putin to political power (seen at left today with a Persian leopard in a rehabilitation park near Sochi) Close: McFaul worked in Washington for President Obama for three years before going to Russia . 'The Russian ban on adoptions by American parents, the Russian order to close the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) operations in Russia, false claims in the Russian media about American desires to foment revolution in Russia and U.S. foreign policy aims in general, the growing pressures on Russian civil society and independent media, the granting of temporary asylum to Edward Snowden, and our different assessments of the causes and consequences of political change in the Middle East and Ukraine are just some of the challenges that we have been compelled to manage,' he wrote in the post. 'Yet, I leave Russia with a strong feeling of satisfaction for how our administration handled these issues without compromising our interests or values.' Familial obligations: McFaul's family lived in Russia with him for the first half of his tenure but has since returned to California . McFaul says that negotiation of a new strategic arms treaty and cooperation on the NATO-led military campaign in Afghanistan are two of the clearest signs of success. 'Since we set out to reset relations with Russia five years ago (yes, I am not afraid to use the word “reset”!), we have achieved a lot,' he wrote. His tenure has also been marked by rising anti-Americanism in Russia that accompanied Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency. 'I will leave Russia reluctantly. I love this job. It is a tremendous honor to represent my country here. I will miss interacting with my partners in the Russian government and with Russians from all sectors of society and business,' he wrote.","Ambassador Michael McFaul has said the distance from his family is the reason for his decision to return to America .

"By . Glen Owen . Boris Johnson should be handed a Commons seat in time for the 2015 Election if David Cameron is to stand any chance of winning a majority, a Tory MP today argues in The Mail on Sunday. Nadine Dorries said that the Conservatives’ poor showing in Thursday’s Wythenshawe by-election – the party was pushed into third place by UKIP – demonstrated the need to bring the  London Mayor on board. Ms Dorries, writing in this paper, makes the point by likening Mr Johnson to a famous beer advert. ‘Boris is our Heineken,’ the Mid Bedfordsire MP says. Boris Johnson is the Tory party's secret weapon, according to commentator Nadine Dorries, who argues that he should be made deputy PM should the Conservative party win the next election . ‘He reaches parts of the electorate other politicians fail to reach. Traditional Conservatives, women, Northerners and floating voters love him.’ Ms Dorries goes on to call Mr Johnson the ‘secret weapon’ who could ensure victory for Mr Cameron – and that he should then be rewarded with the job of Deputy Prime Minister. ‘Boris . . . is the only Conservative . to have won a major election in 22 years. We are months away from the . Euro elections and the party should have him out there on our screens,’ Ms Dorries writes. Boris Johnson can reach areas of the public that the Tory party cannot usually reach, it has been claimed: An acquired taste . ‘The truth is that Boris in a Westminster seat and on the campaign trail is a win-win for both men [Cameron and Johnson] and the entire country. It should be their  selfless, ambition-free duty to make it happen. ‘If the Conservative Party does not win the next Election, then Cameron will stand down as leader. It is inconceivable that there would be a leadership election without the people’s favourite politician... To be part of that process, he needs to become an MP during or before 2015.’ Ms Dorries adds: ‘If Cameron does win a majority, which is much more likely with Boris at his side, then we can rejoice in having a Deputy Prime Minister who wants to control the power of the unions.’ Last week Mr Johnson addressed a private meeting of Tory backbenchers with the smallest majorities who  want to broaden the party’s electoral appeal. Mr Johnson said the Tories must ‘own housing’ as an issue to win the next Election. He also told them the Tories  needed to make gains in the Midlands and North of England to triumph in 2015. One Tory MP who attended the meeting was quoted as saying: ‘You don’t need to be a chief code-cracker . . . to work out the meaning in Boris’s words. He was saying I won two elections in London and, in the same way, there should be no “no-go areas”  in the rest of the country.’","Boris is popular with Northerners and women, according to Dorries .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Silk Road 2.0 has been reportedly hacked by attackers who made off with nearly $2.7million in bitcoin - the online marketplace's entire holdings. The trading site is a reincarnation of Silk Road, the online black market that was dramatically shut down last year following a high-profile FBI sting. But today the site's administrator, Defcon, revealed it had been infiltrated by hackers who exploited the same 'transaction malleability' that caused temporary transfer shutdowns at bitcoin exchanges BitStamp and Mt Gox this week. Reincarnated: Silk Road 2.0 is the reincarnation of Silk Road, the online black market that was dramatically shut down last year following a high-profile FBI sting . Defcon is now calling on the hackers to return the bitcoin. 'Given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward,' he wrote. The site’s users are currently attempting to track down the thief. Writes Defcon: '# Attacker 1: (Responsible for 95% of theft),' wrote one administrator. 'Suspected French, responsible for vast majority of the thefts. Used the following six vendor accounts to order from each other, to find and exploit the vulnerability aggressively.' Arrested: Silk Road was shut down following the arrest the so-called 'digital don' behind it Ross William Ulbricht, 29, who is accused of running the website behind a military-style encryption code that enabled it to become the 'eBay' of the Internet's black market . Black eBay: The FBI shut down the site on October 2nd after infiltrating it. The so-called Deep Web or Dark Web hidden website allegedly worked as an eBay for the black market - selling cocaine and marijuana, drugs, credit card numbers, instructions on how to hack an ATM and other illegal goods . News of the theft has driven the price of BTC down by about 50 points, where it is hovering at 600. The hackers stole over 4474 bitcoins, worth $2,747,000. According to The Verge, Defcon said that a claims a vendor exploited the bug during a vulnerable moment in the site's relaunch process, initiating and hiding a flood of transactions until the accounts were emptied. Bitcoin is a piece of data locked in an internet-based network by a complex equation. Once released it can be traded and used like money online and can be purchased with real cash. Many websites are now taking Bitcoins as a form of currency. As well as digital currency, Bitcoin miners enjoy the competitive nature of unlocking the coins. Famous fans include the Winklevoss twins - famous rivals of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg - who own around 1 per cent of Bitcoins - currently worth around $11million. It has been dismissed by some as a Ponzi Scheme and touted by others as the future of money. It is not centrally controlled and it's unique and complex set up means the market cannot be altered or hacked, according to the developers. There are 21 million coins predicted to last until 2140 and their finite nature means they perform more like a commodity, such as gold. The coins first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. They were introduced by an obscure hacker whose identity is a mystery but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto, which is thought to be a pseudonym. Users choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users.Bitcoins can be bought from specialist currency exchanges and online marketplaces . The relaunch process required unusually lax security procedures by the site, with little separation between vendor wallets and escrow holdings. The report said that although the site is officially active, the administrators have implemented strict new security protocols that would make transactions significantly more difficult. The secret Silk Road website gained notoriety as a black market drug bazaar that accepted bitcoins, an electronic currency, before federal authorities shut it down earlier this month. It used an underground computer network known as ""The Onion Router"" or ""Tor"" that relays computer messages through at least three separate computer servers to disguise its users. It was shut down following the arrest the so-called 'digital don' behind Silk Road, Ross William Ulbricht, 29, who is accused of running the website behind a military-style encryption code that enabled it to become the 'eBay' of the Internet's black market. The FBI shut down the site on October 2nd after infiltrating it. The so-called Deep Web or Dark Web hidden website allegedly worked as an eBay for the black market - selling cocaine and marijuana, drugs, credit card numbers, instructions on how to hack an ATM and other illegal goods. The Baltimore Sun reports that a federal indictment says a Maryland-based federal agent infiltrated Silk Road, posing as a major drug distributor who was looking for high end customers. After selling a kilogram of fake cocaine to one of Ulbricht's co-workers using untraceable BitCoin currency, Ulbricht later confided in the agent that the employee had run off with his money. He allegedly struck a deal with the agent - who he believed to be a major drug distributor - to have the employee tortured so that he would return the money and learn a lesson. Later, after the former employee was arrested, Ulbricht allegedly send the undercover agent another message: 'can you change the order to execute rather than torture?' He explained the employee 'was on the inside for a while, and now he's been arrested, I'm afraid he'll give up info.' The feds say Ulbricht wired $80,000 to the agent.","Predecessor Silk Road was shut down by FBI last year after founder snared .

"By . Glen Owen . He did have a long way to travel – but it was still embarrassing for George Osborne when he turned up late for a power-photo in Australia yesterday. The Chancellor’s cheeks flushed as he was greeted with a chorus of ironic cheers from fellow finance ministers when he finally appeared for an official snap of G20 summit participants, taken against the striking backdrop of Sydney’s Harbour Bridge and Opera House.

Largest economies' chancellors meeting to discuss how to boost jobs ."
"By . Simon Walters . and Glen Owen . Civil war erupted in the Tory Party last night after Boris Johnson accused George Osborne of lying about urging him to make a  Commons comeback. Supporters of the London Mayor claimed the Chancellor’s camp was engaging in a ‘dirty tricks plot’ to wreck his hopes of becoming Conservative leader – and boost Mr Osborne’s own ambitions for the job . The simmering ‘Boris versus George’ leadership feud burst into the open over reports that Mr Osborne had ‘delivered personally’ a message to Mr Johnson that David Cameron wants him to stand as a parliamentary candidate at the next Election. Future potential leadership rivals George Osborne, left, and Boris Johnson together in China last year . The aim was said to be to force  Mr Johnson to prove his loyalty by ‘pinning his political fate to that of the Prime Minister’. But it sparked a fierce backlash from Mr Johnson. A well-placed source says that, when he was told Mr Osborne had approached him about the matter, the Mayor exclaimed: ‘Bull****! There has been no such conversation. They are trying to tie me in.’ Mr Johnson believes the manoeuvre is a ploy to ensure he gets equal blame if the Tories lose power, and make it easier for Mr Osborne to beat him in a subsequent race to succeed Mr Cameron. There is a growing rift between the two men, now seen as the main candidates in the race to succeed Mr Cameron in the event of a Tory flop at the next Election. And the row is set to intensify as Mr Johnson will address Conservative Election candidates at a reception in the Commons tomorrow. Mr Johnson has made no secret of his desire to return to the Commons, but the timing of his return is seen as a crucial factor in determining whether he can win the Tory crown. Mr Johnson believes the manoeuvre is a ploy to tie his fortunes to David Cameron at the next election, complicating his leadership bid . The Mayor fears that if he stands at the next Election – or even before by contesting a by-election – and the Conservatives lose, he will be ‘tainted’, along with all others involved in the campaign. Instead, he intended to wait until after the Election and make a quick Commons return in a by-election – in time to throw his hat into the ring if Mr Cameron steps down. Until recently, Mr Johnson was seen as frontrunner in the Conservative leadership stakes. But Mr Osborne’s success with the economy has changed that and he is now seen as a serious contender. Tory MPs say arch political tactician Mr Osborne has built up a formidable covert leadership team, including potential leadership running mate Michael Gove, the Education Secretary. He could rely on support from close friend Mr Cameron, who has always regarded fellow Old Etonian Mr Johnson with suspicion. Mr Johnson’s allies say high-flying Business Minister Matthew Hancock, a protégé of Mr Osborne, is a key figure in behind-the-scenes  plotting – but he denies it. An ally of the Mayor said: ‘This is nothing to do with party loyalty and everything to do with Osborne and Cameron trying to destabilise Boris. ‘He saw it coming a mile off. They want to make sure that if the Tories lose, Boris gets as much flak as they do and can’t stand as leader as a “break with the failed Cameron-Osborne regime”. ‘Boris can play a full part in the Election campaign regardless of whether he stands in the General Election. This is a clumsy attempt to con him into doing it, with inevitable claims that he can’t wait for Cameron to fail, or falsely accuse him of disloyalty if he doesn’t stand.’ One of Boris’s admirers said: ‘If the Conservatives lose the Election, the Tory faithful will be begging Boris to come back as their saviour and he will be unbeatable. That is what worries Osborne.’ Another MP close to Mr Johnson claimed the Osborne-Gove camp were trying to trick Mr Johnson into leading the Tory campaign against UKIP’s Nigel Farage ‘because they know it would lose Boris votes in any Tory leadership contest .  .  . Boris isn’t daft’. Allies of Mr Osborne denied the Chancellor was plotting against Mr Johnson. ‘There is nothing in this,’ said one. ‘The Prime Minister has already said he wants Boris to be an MP. Someone is making mischief.’ An MP close to Mr Johnson claimed rivals were trying to trick Mr Johnson into leading the Tory campaign against UKIP's Nigel Farage because they know it would cost him popularity among eurosceptics . Mr Johnson’s friends say he has yet to decide when he will return to the Commons. His term as London Mayor runs until 2016 but, theoretically, there is nothing to stop him serving as Mayor and an MP simultaneously, as his Labour predecessor Ken Livingstone did for part of his two terms as Mayor. There is no doubt that the Boris charm offensive has already started. Returns to Commons after 2015 Election . ADVANTAGE: He stays above the fray if Tories lose – and bides his time if Cameron triumphs. DANGER: If Cameron quits, Boris must find a seat fast to enter the leadership race. Returns to Commons at 2015 Election . ADVANTAGE: Perfectly placed to throw his hat into the ring if Cameron flops. DANGER: If Tories lose, he is linked to the flop and ‘tainted’. If Cameron triumphs, Boris is stuck on the Commons sidelines. Returns to Commons before 2015 Election . ADVANTAGE: If Tory ratings fall and panicking MPs sack Cameron, Boris  can become PM. DANGER: Claims he had returned early to wield the knife would damage him. At tomorrow night’s ‘Parliamentary Candidates Evening’ he will have a chance to win over many of those set to become MPs after the 2015 Election. But one of those invited said: ‘It’s a bit confusing for us, because we see him as a potential rival for some of the best seats.’ The growing rivalry between Mr Johnson and Mr Osborne has led to the creation of two gangs of rival Tory MPs, the ‘Friends of Boris’ (FOBS) and the ‘Friends of George’ (FOGS), including Deputy Chief Whip Greg Hands and Tory MPs Harriett Baldwin and Nadhim Zahawi. FOGS make risqué jokes about Mr Johnson’s bumbling image and messy private life; FOBS counter by gossiping about why the Chancellor has adopted a new haircut – and whether the colour is natural. One FOB sarcastically complained: ‘Osborne is trying to make sure the proceeds of growth go straight into his leadership account’. The Osborne-Johnson rivalry spilled over last autumn when  both men travelled to China at the same time, and Boris’s team accused Osborne of trying to cut him out of key events. Nadine Dorries, one of the few Tory MPs to publicly back Boris, has likened him to a famous beer advert, saying, ‘Boris is our Heineken. He reaches parts of the electorate other politicians fail to reach.’ She added that any leadership contest would be ‘inconceivable’ without Mr Johnson.","London Mayor has been seen as frontrunner in Tory leadership stakes .

"By . Simon Walters, Mail on Sunday Political Editor . Faked? A woman calling herself Laura Crawford Buckley claimed she was dangled over the Thames . BBC radio presenter James Naughtie’s claim to have witnessed one of the most notorious, debauched Commons scandals of all time sparked a fresh controversy last night – nearly 30 years after it happened. A host of political celebrities, including George Osborne and Jeffrey Archer, last week attended the launch party of Naughtie’s highly regarded political thriller, The Madness Of July. The title is inspired by an incident, described in the book, that allegedly took place on the Commons terrace on a hot July night three decades ago when Naughtie was a young political scribe. It is Westminster’s equivalent of the ‘headless man’ photograph riddle in the Duchess of Argyll’s divorce in 1963. According to banner headlines in 1985, a ‘topless woman’ was dangled over the Thames by Labour MPs during an all-night parliamentary sitting after a riverboat trip. She later posed for risque photos and told how her ‘boobs popped out when tipsy Labour MPs dangled her over the Thames’. Writing in The Mail on Sunday today, Naughtie says that he saw  it happen. He states: ‘A favourite story in  the book is based on an incident I witnessed when a girl was dangled over the terrace of the Commons late at night by boisterous backbenchers and seemed likely to drop into the Thames.’ But a Mail on Sunday investigation into the real ‘mad night in July’ has finally uncovered what truly happened – and it is not quite as stated by the respected Mr Naughtie. And for the first time, we can reveal the full cast of famous names involved. They include John Prescott; Mr Prescott’s close friend and confidante Rosie Winterton – now Ed Miliband’s Chief Whip; lobbying guru Matthew Freud – the future son-in-law of Rupert Murdoch; Guardian writer and media ethics expert Roy Greenslade and Labour peer Peter Snape .  .  . plus a topless model and a hellraising 1980s DJ. According to accounts at the time, recounted by Mr Naughtie, Labour MPs were drinking on the terrace when an unnamed woman was dangled over the river, causing her breasts to be exposed, setting off the security alarm and resulting in anti-terrorist police being called to the scene. One report had the SAS leaping into action. The late Tory MP, Geoffrey Dickens, claimed to have seen it and denounced the Labour high jinks. Terrace: The incident was said to have taken place at the Commons Terrace bar, but it is in doubt . Days later, out of the blue, ‘busty kissogram Laura Crawford-Buckley’ claimed to be the topless woman and gave an interview to The Sun, posing with the Commons terrace behind and then stripping off for the defunct News of the World. Laura claimed she went to the Commons with ‘DJ friend’ Robert Pereno. She was plied with drink by Labour MPs who dangled her over the terrace and ‘fell out of the top’ of her dress. However, Labour’s Lord Peter Snape, who was there, says it is ‘total nonsense’. Snape won £10,000 damages after a newspaper blamed him for the ‘scandal’. Claims: James Naughtie, who presents Radio 4's Today programme, relives the account in the MoS . He claims Dickens lied – there was no topless woman, the kissogram  ‘made it all up’ in a public relations stunt, Naughtie got it wrong and wasn’t even there. Speaking publicly for the first time about the incident, Lord Snape said the mad night on the Commons terrace started innocently when Ms Winterton, secretary to Snape and Prescott, then a rising Labour star, organised a boat trip for a group of Labour-supporting cyclists. ‘A dozen or so Labour MPs were on board – it became known as “the ship of shame” – though it was no stag-do, there were women MPs there too,’ Lord Snape chuckled. ‘It was a lovely summer evening and some of the guests joined us on the terrace for a drink. One of the blokes caused trouble and was asked to leave. One of the girls had too much to drink and was sick over the terrace. That is all. 'The stuff about a naked woman dangled over the terrace was fiction. I tracked down Dickens and he confessed he had two halves of lager and left the bar early. He was put up to it. Then some dolly bird claimed she was the topless woman. It was all a fake.’ Lord Snape also questioned Naughtie’s account. ‘I’ve been a regular at the terrace bar for 40 years and have seen Jim at The Savoy and even The White House, but never at the terrace bar. He’s too grand to socialise with the likes of me.’ Rumours that the ‘topless woman’ story was not all it seemed, surfaced weeks after the first headlines. Journalists’ trade magazine Press Gazette claimed the ‘kissogram’ and her friend Mr  Pereno had ‘hoaxed’ the News of the World. It said Matthew Freud, at the start of his career as a celebrated public relations fixer, was involved. Press Gazette later apologised, saying the paper had shown it ‘statutory declarations made by Freud and the lady in question reaffirming the truth of the story’. A source close to Mr Freud told the MoS yesterday that ‘kissogram Laura’ had not been on the Commons terrace. The source said Mr Freud helped Mr Pereno contact The Sun by giving him the phone number of Mr Greenslade, then assistant editor of the newspaper. Mr Freud, who was 21 at the time, has never lived it down. When  he married Mr Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth in 2001, it was the  highlight of one of the wedding speeches. The Mail on Sunday can find no trace of ‘kissogram’ Ms Crawford-Buckley. Actor, DJ, singer and ‘hellraiser’ Mr Pereno hit the headlines again, later in the 1980s, when he married 15-year-old ‘wild child’ Emma Ridley in Las Vegas. A low-budget film about his life was made last year. A friend of Mr Pereno said: ‘He has gone AWOL at the moment.’ Mr Greenslade said last night: ‘I was very close to Matthew Freud at the time but I don’t recall this story. The 1980s are a bit of a blur.’","BBC Radio 4 presenter claims 'boistrous back-benchers' involved in 1985 .

"By . Tom Kelly . and James Chapman . Credentials: Oxford-educated Patrick Rock, 62, comes from a noble background. He is pictured here in 1984 during the Portsmouth South by-election . Born Patrick Robert John Rock de Besombes to a family of European aristocrats, he has worked for leading Tories for four decades. But despite his impeccable social and political contacts, Oxford-educated Rock has repeatedly failed in his ambition to become a Conservative MP, despite being selected to fight safe seats. Rock, 62 and unmarried, lives in a £500,000 flat in Parsons Green, West London. He was born in Kensington in 1951, a year after the marriage of his mother Gertrud and Egyptian-born father Robert John Rock de Besombes. His paternal grandmother was a D'aigneaux, from a noble French family that originated in Normandy and boasts a coat of arms. As . a teenager, Rock boarded at the elite Jesuit Stonyhurst College in . Lancashire, winning a scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford, where he . studied history. After . graduation he worked as Margaret Thatcher's political correspondence . secretary in the then Prime Minister's Office and also as managing . director of the Retail Consortium. It . is not clear when he shortened his name to plain Patrick Rock, but he . used it while fighting the Woolwich East election in 1979, aged 28, . which he lost despite increasing the Tory vote. After losing Crewe and Nantwich in the 1983 election he was selected in a by-election to defend the seemingly impregnable safe seat of Portsmouth South in 1984, which had a Tory majority of over 12,000. The Portsmouth News described him as 'Mrs Thatcher's protege' who had been hand-picked by Downing Street to contest the seat ahead of more impressive local candidates. During the campaign he was described as 'likeable and energetic but slightly wet behind the ears'. His campaign went catastrophically wrong after he spoke on TV about a hospital that was not in the constituency. Rock was unconcerned, declaring at a public meeting that he was 'absolutely certain' he would win the seat, predicting Labour would finish second and the Liberal SDP Alliance trail in third. But after a 14 per cent swing against him, he was defeated by the Alliance's Mike Hancock in what was labelled the 'biggest election upset for years' and a 'great surprise' to Mrs Thatcher. Rock boarded at the elite Jesuit Stonyhurst College in Lancashire before winning a scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford . Newspaper reports described the defeated Rock leaving the count 'pale with shock'. He blamed the defeat on too many Conservatives staying at home and Mrs Thatcher phoned him the following morning to assure him the defeat was not his fault. The following year, he was appointed to the Conservative Research Department. He later worked as special adviser to Cabinet ministers in the Department of the Environment and then the Home Office, where he met David Cameron. The pair are famously said to have repaired to the Two Chairmen pub on the day of the death in 1994 of Labour leader John Smith, where they agreed Tony Blair would take over, leaving their party 'f*****'. Rock again attempted to become an MP in 1990, applying for the safe Tory seat of Devizes, but failed to be selected. He also worked in Brussels for EU Commissioner Chris Patten, with the responsibility for the western Balkans, before becoming a policy adviser at Downing Street. Colleagues describe him as 'abrasive' and 'a commentator rather an a doer'. Another said his arrest over child abuse images was a 'terrific shock'.

"By . Simon Walters . and Brendan Carlin . Liberal Democrat Cabinet Minister Danny Alexander was accused last night of positioning himself to succeed Nick Clegg after he appeared to initiate a power struggle with Vince Cable. Business Secretary Mr Cable is furious that Treasury Chief Secretary Mr Alexander is demanding to be the party’s main economic spokesman at next year’s General Election. Lib Dem MPs have accused Mr Alexander, 41, of using the issue to further his ambition of taking over in the event that the party flops at the polls and Mr Clegg is forced to resign. Danny Alexander (left) was accused of positioning himself to success Nick Clegg after beginning a power struggle with Vince Cable (right) Colleagues believe that Mr Cable still harbours leadership ambitions. He regrets not standing against Mr Clegg in 2007, but opponents say that he has left it too late. At 70, Mr Cable is nearly 30 years older than Mr Alexander. There is an even bigger gulf in their politics. Mr Alexander is a robust ally of Chancellor George Osborne and was recently embarrassed by a Tory MP’s suggestion that he had abandoned his Lib Dem roots and ‘gone native’ since joining the Treasury. By contrast, Mr Cable has attacked Mr Osborne’s ‘austerity’ cuts, led demands for a mansion tax and applauded the rise in immigration. At the Lib Dem spring conference in York yesterday, Mr Alexander took to the stage to say that, if the party is still in power after the Election, he will raise the annual income tax personal allowance from £10,000 to £12,500. And in an apparent attempt to rebuff claims that he is too close to the Tories, Mr Alexander told activists that the  Lib Dems had fought the Conservatives to provide tax cuts for working people. Nick Clegg at the party conference today. It is thought both men are hoping to succeed the party leader if he is forced to resign in the event the party flops at the polls . He boasted that Mr Clegg had already picked him to lead the Lib Dem team which will, if necessary, conduct fresh coalition talks with the Tories. But on Friday, Mr Cable won a standing ovation from Lib Dem supporters in York after making a passionate speech about his political roots. The Vince-versus-Danny feud threatens to overshadow Mr Clegg’s attempts to portray the Lib Dems as Britain’s only genuine pro-Brussels party and stave off humiliation at European elections in May. One Lib Dem MP said: ‘It’s obvious that Danny’s now on manoeuvres and sees himself as a future leader. He’s positioning himself as Clegg’s replacement if we come unstuck at the Election. ‘He knows he has been damaged by claims that he is George Osborne’s patsy but it will take more than a couple of speeches on cutting tax for the low-paid to change that. ‘No one denies that Vince went through a bad patch last year, when he seemed to lose his touch. But he is back in the game and has not given up hope of getting the leadership.’ A Lib Dem peer said: ‘Vince is a household name and widely respected. No one has ever heard of Danny Alexander.’","Danny Alexander accused of positioning himself to succeed Nick Clegg .

The girl can be seen trying to stand before her legs crumple beneath her, according to footage released to KTLA on Tuesday.

He was identified as 32-year-old Adan Camacho from Santa Ana and he was booked . into jail for felony hit-and-run and driving without a valid license. WATCH VIDEO HERE . Impact: She is seen splayed in the road after being hit by the black vehicle. Both drivers left the scene . Hurt: The girl tries to walk but she collapses. She suffered leg injuries but has been released from hospital . The driver of the black Cadillac climbed out of the vehicle to help the girl collect her belongings. Arrest: One of the drivers, Adan Camacho, was caught and charged with felony hit-and-run . But when officers arrived, the driver never identified herself as being involved and left the scene. Police are now searching for this driver, who also faces felony hit-and-run charges. 'Had both drivers stayed at the scene, this would have been the 14-year-old's fault. She was responsible for what happened,' Santa Ana Police Department Cpl. Anthony Bertagna told KTLA. 'She crossed against the red … Obviously he didn’t see her. She jetted out in front of him.' He added that they were hoping to identify the second driver. 'She actually picks up the victim's backpack and appears to be looking into her care, and then for whatever reason, she gets back into her car and leaves the scene without identifying herself as being involved in the accident,' Bertagna said. 'We’re hoping she'll come forward and we can straighten this out.' Camacho is due in court Wednesday. The girl was released from hospital on Tuesday.","Teenage girl crossed Santa Ana road during busy traffic on Monday .

"By . Simon Walters . As a Cabinet Minister in Margaret Thatcher’s Government, Norman Tebbit was renowned for his brutal style of politics. He was once called a semi-house-trained polecat and nicknamed ‘the Chingford skinhead’ after his Essex constituency. The satirical TV puppet show Spitting Image fuelled  the image by portraying him as a snarling, leather-jacketed thug. But Lord Tebbit displays a softer side to his character in a children’s novel he has written, called Ben’s Story. It features a talking dog, a yellow labrador called Ben, and Sam, a 14-year-old boy. Faithful friend: The Tebbits with their labrador Ben, who died five years ago . As a Cabinet Minister in Margaret Thatcher's Government, Mr Tebbit was renowned for his brutal style of politics . Ben is named after Lord Tebbit and his wife Margaret’s own labrador, who died five years ago. The book is billed as a ‘contemporary story about murder, friendship, adversity and personal struggle’. Sam’s father is killed in a car crash, which also leaves Sam paralysed. But the boy suspects it was not an accident, and, aided by Ben and Alice Bacon, an eccentric old lady and former spy, he embarks on a gripping adventure as he tries to discover the truth about the death of his father, a television journalist who was on the trail of drugs gangsters. It is the latest chapter in former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit’s unlikely literary career, following the publication five years ago of a successful recipe book, The Game Cook, featuring his favourite pheasant and partridge dishes. Norman Tebbit (right) pictured with (from left to right) Dennis Healey, Lord Roy Jenkins and Sir Robin Day . In spite of his traditional Tory views, Ben’s Story is set in the modern world and tackles issues such as divorce and drug addiction. It also draws heavily on the Tebbits’ own ordeal in the IRA’s  1984 bomb attack on the Grand Hotel in Brighton. Lady Tebbit was left with crippling injuries and Lord Tebbit, now 82, was lucky to survive after being buried in the rubble. Like Lady Tebbit, young Sam is treated at Stoke Mandeville hospital and has to come to terms with being wheelchair-bound. And again like Lady Tebbit, he receives support from a specially trained help dog. In part, the book is Lord Tebbit’s tribute to the real Ben, who was provided by West Sussex-based Canine Partners, an organisation that supplies dogs to help disabled people enjoy greater independence. The book is billed as a 'contemporary story about murder, friendship, adversity and personal struggle' Lord Tebbit gives the fictional Ben the magical power to talk to Sam,  to help the youngster find out what really happened to his father. The book also features people and places linked to Lord Tebbit’s political past. He says the spy Lady Alice is inspired by Dame Daphne Park, one of Britain’s most celebrated spies, who died, aged 88, in 2010. Dame Daphne, sometimes described as ‘a cross between James Bond and Miss Marple’, and Lord Tebbit knew each other well and sat together in the Lords. Lord Tebbit said last night: ‘I just felt like writing something different. Events are seen more from the dog’s point of view than a human’s. ‘It is a work of fiction, but many of the places, such as the dog school  at Canine Partners, do exist. And those who knew Daphne Park, a brave and distinguished MI6 secret agent in Russia and Africa, will realise Alice bears more than a passing resemblance to her. ‘Sadly there all too many boys who suffer severe spinal injuries and have to cope with life confined to a wheelchair. Ben the yellow lab is like many of the help dogs trained  at Canine Partners, and is quite a lot like my dear old friend.’ Rupert Matthews, of Lord Tebbit’s publishers, Bretwalda, said: ‘When Lord Tebbit talks about his fictional characters suffering sudden, life-shattering injury, he knows from his own experience how it feels.’ Ben’s Story is published on June 1.","In Government, Norman Tebbit was renowned for his brutal style of politics .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A man was arrested after a teenage girl he allegedly exposed himself to chased him for half an hour until police arrived. Jodie Schofield, 16, was walking down an alleyway near her home off Blackfriars Road in Salford, Greater Manchester, when she claims a man appeared and exposed himself. Jodie immediately ran after the man and after a two-mile pursuit her screams eventually alerted two builders who helped detain him on New Hall Road as she called police. Feisty 16-year-old Jodie Schofield was so annoyed when a middle-aged man allegedly flashed at her that she chased him for thirty minutes until two builders stopped him and the police arrived to arrest him . A 52-year-old man was arrested at the scene and has since been released on bail. Jodie, who was returning home after walking her cousin to school at St Peter and St John Primary School at the time of the incident, said she gave chase out of anger as the man had been ‘laughing’ throughout the act. She said: “I saw him peeking around the corner and then he disappeared. “I shouted at him and told him to stop but he was just laughing at me the whole time and I didn’t want him to get away with it. “I was running after him for ages – about 30 minutes – but I just didn’t want him to get away. After a while two builders saw us and I was shouting what had happened so they managed to get hold of him and keep him there until the police arrived.” That's my girl: proud mother Maria Schofield hugs 16-year-old daughter Jodie (right) after the teen faced the horror of allegedly being flashed at by a 52-year-old man . Jodie didn’t know the builders who came to her aid but said she wanted to thank them again having only had chance to speak to them briefly at the scene. She said: “I want to say thank you to them for helping me stop him because it’s a horrible thing to go through.” A Greater Manchester Police spokesman confirmed the incident is being investigated. He said: “We received a call at 10.36am where an adult male had been detained by members of the public and was arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure. “He was chased by the complainant and detained nearby by builders who had seen him running away. “He has since been bailed until May 1, pending further enquiries.” Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Jodie Schofield, 16, was returning home after dropping cousin at school when incident happened .

"By . Simon Walters . George Osborne was accused of 'insulting' middle-class voters last night after claiming that making them pay higher tax rates is 'good for them' because it makes them feel successful . George Osborne was accused of ‘insulting’ middle-class voters last night after claiming that making them pay higher tax rates is ‘good for them’ because it makes them feel successful – and more likely to back the Tories. Conservative MPs were stunned when the Chancellor made the explosive remark at a secret meeting at his Downing Street office, the contents of which have been leaked to The Mail on Sunday. The disclosure came as Mr Osborne is poised to announce a Budget boost for the low-paid by raising the threshold for income tax to £10,500, while rejecting pleas to stop more middle earners being dragged into the 40p tax band. MPs at the meeting reacted with horror when he told them: ‘Let’s not forget there are advantages in more people paying tax at 40p. ‘It means they feel they are a success and joining the aspirational classes. 'That means they are more likely to think like Conservatives and vote Conservative. 'If they are paying 40p tax they have a greater interest in cutting Government spending because they are paying for it. All the polling evidence suggests I am right.’ One MP who was present said: ‘There was a stunned silence. I never thought I’d hear a Tory Chancellor say paying more tax is good for the middle classes. It was a Marie Antoinette moment.’ Another added: ‘The 40p rate may not affect the millionaire son of a baronet like Mr Osborne but it is killing hard-working people who earn around £40,000. It was an insult and shows how out of touch this Government has become.’ One Tory told Mr Osborne that his argument was ‘illogical’: ‘You cannot argue that making more  people pay 40p tax is good because they are more likely to want to cut government spending, while letting more people at the bottom end pay no tax whatsoever.’ The Chancellor’s claim was made at a meeting with senior Tory MPs on the executive of the party’s 1922 Committee on February 5. The group was led by 1922 chairman Graham Brady and included John Whittingdale, Bernard Jenkin, Simon Hart, Heather Wheeler and Nick de Bois. Mr Whittingdale was among those who challenged Mr Osborne. The disclosure came as Mr Osborne is poised to announce a Budget boost for the low-paid by raising the threshold for income tax to £10,500, while rejecting pleas to stop more middle earners being dragged into the 40p tax band . He said: ‘I simply don’t follow your . logic. What Conservative voters really want is the same as all voters – . that is to pay less tax, not more. 'Those on a higher rate want to pay a . lower one and those on a lower one do not want to be dragged into higher . one. That is one of the fundamental differences between us and our . opponents and it has stood us  in good stead for many years.’ The Chancellor’s team later contacted Tory tax rebels ordering them to stay quiet. ‘I was told that  if I carried on speaking out, I was betraying the party,’ said one. ‘The people who are betraying the party are not me but those who have abandoned our roots.’ Ministers say Mr Osborne is determined to steal the credit from Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for lifting the starting rate for tax, due to go up to £10,000 in April, by at least another £500 next year. The policy was devised by Mr Clegg, but it is believed Mr Osborne is toying with increasing it by between £750 and £1,000 next year. Increasing the personal allowance to £10,500 is worth an extra £100 a year – or £2 a week – to everyone earning up to £100,000 a year, at an annual cost of £1.5 billion. Supporters of a rise in the 40p rate threshold say it would give higher earners approximately an extra £200 a year. But Mr Osborne’s aides believe it would be seen as unfair. The claims were made at a meeting with senior Tory MPs on the executive party of the 1922 Committee. Nick de Bois (left) and committee chairman Graham Brady (right) were present at the meeting . Also at the secret meeting at Mr Osborne's Downing Street office were Bernard Jenkin (left), John Wittingdale (right), Heather Wheeler, Robert Buckland and Simon Hart . ‘We can’t give the better-off £200 more and the less-well-off £100,’ said one. ‘The punters just won’t buy it and we have to listen to them.’ A Treasury source said: ‘George was making the point that under a Tory Chancellor, people on the 40p rate are paying less tax.’ Meanwhile Mr Osborne’s Treasury deputy, Lib Dem Chief Secretary Danny Alexander, today takes a swipe at ex-Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson over the tax row. In his article, below, Mr Alexander attacks ‘siren voices’ like Lord Lawson who complain too many people are now paying the 40p rate. Without referring to Lord Lawson, Mr Alexander observes pointedly that ‘one of the leading exponents of this theory is also a noted denier of climate change (so), it is no surprise they are completely missing the point.’ Sources confirmed the jibe was aimed at Lord Lawson, a noted climate-change sceptic. The 40p tax band was introduced in 1988 by Nigel Lawson .","The Chancellor is said to have made the comments in a secret meeting .

"By . Rosie Taylor . A debt-ridden hospital trust has spent £50,000 on a promotional film, to the anger of patients. Campaigners claim people would learn more from an episode of Casualty than from the six-minute video. They also say the money would have been better spent on operations at a time when funds are short. Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which is £7million in debt and trying to make savings of more than £30million, commissioned the film in an attempt to win back public confidence following a damning report by inspectors. Debt-ridden Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has been criticised for spending £50,000 on a promotional film at a time when the trust is a£7million in the red and trying to make savings of more than £30million . Campaigners claim people would learn more from an episode of Casualty than from the six-minute Every Minute of Every Day video. They claim the money would have been better off spent on operations at a time when funds are short . The Every Minute Of Every Day video, posted online, was designed to convince patients and relatives that staff care. Wexham Park, in Slough, Berkshire, spent £48,943 for the film to be made by a private company, a Freedom of Information request revealed. This does not include the time of staff who took part. The video has been viewed 8,500 times since it was posted on YouTube in November, days before the leaking of an email from the Trust’s chief executive Philippa Slinger saying she felt patients were scared to attend the hospital and GPs were worried about referring them because of negative publicity surrounding alleged blunders. Wexham Park was accused of failing to protect the safety and welfare of patients following an unannounced inspection by the Care Quality Commission in October. Video Source YouTube . The CQC said wards were short-staffed . and patients’ dignity was not always respected. It also said that . record-keeping was poor and staff complained of bullying by managers.

"By . Ashley Collman . Divine intervention: Stephanie Hamman, 23, crashed her car into Providence Church Sunday night claiming God told her to do it . A 23-year-old woman claiming to be possessed by the devil crashed her car into a church in Church Hill, Tennessee before proceeding to stab her husband in the chest for 'worshiping NASCAR'. Now former high-school cheerleader Staphanie Peery Hamman is facing charges for the damage she did to the church and trying to kill her husband. After her arrest Sunday night, Hamman explained to police that she drove through Providence Church's front doors when she found the building locked and wanted to drop off some items. 'God told me He wanted me in there, so I drove my car through the doors. God told me to, so I did it,' she told police. After driving through the doors, Hamman put the items on the altar and then called her husband to tell him she wrecked her Toyota. Husband Steven Hamman was just across the street at their apartment watching the NASCAR race, and ran over to check on Stephanie. When he arrived he found his wife laying in front of the altar, but when he approached she said 'the devil is in me' and then stabbed him in the right side of the chest with a large kitchen knife. Hamman told police she brought the knife with her because the devil told her to. 'I prayed I would not have to use it on him, but I did,' she said. Steven pulled the knife out himself and then fled the church back to the apartment where he waited for paramedics to arrive. Scroll down for video . Breaking in: Hamman told police she drove through the church's front doors when she found them locked and needed to get in to drop off some items . Twenty minutes after the incident was . reported around 10pm, police found Hamman at the Holston Valley . Hospital and Medical Center, where she claimed to have been dropped off by relatives. They arrested her on the scene and she went on to describe what propelled her to stab her husband. According . to the police report, Hamman 'felt her husband Steven was worshiping . the NASCAR race at Bristol, which made her mad, and she began having . thoughts that the devil put in her head.' She also talked at length about her love for smoking marijuana. 'I . smoke a bunch of week, I love to smoke it. Sometimes when I do, I start . seeing things that others don't. Isn't God good? He told me that this . would happen and just look, I am okay,' she said. But . she also said that God had told her to stop smoking marijuana 'all day . and all night' and that she should only 'smoke it at night to help her . relax'.

He was across the street at their apartment watching a NASCAR race at the time . Possessed: Steven Hamman said he arrived to find his wife lying in front of the altar. She said 'the devil is in me' before stabbing him in the right side of the chest with a large kitchen knife . Kept apart: Steven Hamman pulled the knife out himself and fled to get medical attention. As of Monday he was in fair condition while his wife was behind bars without bond . 'One of the statements she apparently has made was that she attended this church, and she was baptized here on Sunday - which is incorrect. We've never known her to even visit here, and certainly didn't have a baptism here yesterday,"" Providence Church Pastor Joel Trigg told WJHL. However, authorities believe she may have been baptized at another church in Scott County, Virginia that day. Hamman was arrested and transported to Hawkins County Jail where she was reportedly being held without bond. As of Monday afternoon, Steven Hamman was in fair condition at the hospital. Pastor Triggs went in to check on Steven and told WATE 'he seemed to be doing OK'. 'Again, our hearts really go out to them, 'Pastor Trigg said.

"By . Simon Walters, Mail on Sunday Political Editor . Michael Gove faces another dressing-down from David Cameron after appearing to take a sideswipe at him, Boris Johnson and George Osborne for their antics in the riotous Bullingdon Club. In an interview in today’s Mail on Sunday Event magazine, Education Secretary Mr Gove sings the praises of a rap singer who has mocked the Prime Minister, London Mayor and Chancellor for being members of the upper-crust Oxford group known for its drunken high jinks. One song says Mr Cameron is a ‘dud’ leader who treats people like ‘serfs’ and makes people want to ‘punch him in the dimples’, and ridicules his claim to like the The Smiths pop group. Another line says Mr Johnson is ‘simple’ and ‘spouts utter tripe', while Mr Osborne is ‘little Georgie who never bought a round’. Despite his Tory-mocking lyrics, Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer, left, is a hit with Michael Gove, right . Mr Gove’s favourite rapper – Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer, real name Jim Burke – has also written a song about cocaine and another called More Kissing In Porn. The Minister’s praise for Mr B comes . days after he was rebuked by Mr Cameron for claiming there is a . ‘ridiculous’ number of Old Etonians in Downing Street. From: THEY DON’T  ALLOW RAPPERS IN  THE BULLINGDON CLUBI chanced upon a blond scruffSpouting utter tripe‘Boris DePfeffel’ said he By way of introduction‘Want to join the chaps and I at a private function?’Now Boris knew his classics, But clearly was simpleDave inspired desireBut just to punch him in his dimplesHs gait was airy-fairyAnd his plans unsound And little Georgie never bought a roundCome to think of it, I didn’t want their jobsAnd why would Mr B hang around with such nobs?You can listen to the Smiths, But that’s far from the pithI’m heading for a snubAnd they don’t allow rappers in the Bullingdon Club . The remark was seen by some as an attempt by Mr Gove to highlight his humble roots as the adopted son of an Aberdeen fishmonger – in marked contrast to Old Etonians Mr Cameron and Mr Gove’s potential Tory leadership rival Mr Johnson. Mr Cameron, Mr Johnson and baronet’s son Mr Osborne were all in the Bullingdon Club in their student days, but not Mr Gove, who went to Oxford after winning a scholarship to a fee-paying school. Mr Gove says in Event: ‘I am strangely addicted to “chap hop” rapper Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer.’ ‘Chap hop’ is a quirky English form of American ‘hip hop’ that parodies English culture. Pipe-smoking, self-styled English gent  Mr B raps about high society, cricket, drugs, politics, tea, sex and the weather. He plays the ‘banjolele’, a cross between a banjo and a ukulele. Mr B’s sideswipe at the Tory Oxford brigade is called They Don’t Allow Rappers In The Bullingdon Club, while Mr B’s Bullingdon Breakdown rap says: ‘Ra, ra, ra! We’re going to smash the oiks. Mr Major was dull to the untrained eye, but at least he liked cricket and wore a tie. It’s more than I can say for Dave, who thinks the serfs should behave.’ His The Crack Song lampoons rock stars for using cocaine to achieve fame and More Kissing In Porn asks: ‘So a crusade I’m going to start: Why can’t there be more kissing in porn?’ In the article, Mr Gove says: ‘I have a soft spot for contemporary English “eccentric” music. I liked Neil Innes and the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band .  .  . and am strangely addicted to “chap hop” rappers Professor Elemental, Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer and Mr Bruce And The Correspondents.’","Micheal Gove named Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer as a favourite musician .

"By . Glen Owen . A BBC journalist faced calls for  his sacking last night for attempting to cover up the extent of his involvement with the far-Right British National Party. Duncan Weldon, the controversial new economics correspondent for Newsnight, took part in a racist leafleting campaign in 2000 which made scaremongering claims about refugees being ‘shipped’ to Newcastle. The leaflets alleged that a London council planned to move 16,000 asylum seekers to the area, saying the ‘shipping’ of refugees would ‘change the ethnic make-up of the area’, lead to ‘whites living in fear’ and cause Newcastle to become ‘riot-torn’. Duncan Weldon (left) took part in a racist leafleting campaign in 2000 which made scaremongering claims about refugees being 'shipped' to Newcastle. The campaign was organised by BNP member Kevin Scott (right) The campaign was organised by Kevin Scott, a self-confessed racist with a conviction for assault who used the slogan Rights For Whites. BNP leader Nick Griffin was later forced to apologise for the leaflets, but Mr Scott refused, saying: ‘I think the multi-racialists should apologise to the people of Newcastle .  .  . for trying to impose a multi-racial society on them against their democratically expressed wishes.’ Mr Weldon – already embroiled in a row over his suitability for Newsnight because of his Labour Party affiliations and lack of journalistic experience – posted a blog online this weekend to try to play down his part in the BNP’s campaign. Writing after being asked about his BNP links by The Mail on Sunday, he said he had spent ‘a year  or so’ when he was a school sixth-former ‘flirting’ with the far-Right, but insisted: ‘During that time I never joined any political organisation or attended any meeting, but read ravenously.’ However, in an article he wrote in 2002 as an Oxford student under the false name Sam Healey, he admitted being involved in a number of BNP events, including one demonstration that descended into a violent encounter with the police. The article Duncan Weldon wrote about his time at Oxford with the BNP. He wrote under the false name Sam Healey and admitted being involved in a number of BNP events . At one event, he handed out the ‘decidedly racist’ leaflets, while the other event was a demonstration of ‘about 200 members’ which saw police ‘holding people back’. He added: ‘I don’t know if my parents ever suspected, but most of my friends at home knew. They were incredibly relieved when I stopped attending meetings.’ Last night Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who wrote to Newsnight editor Ian Katz questioning Mr Weldon’s suitability, said: ‘Given  the revelations about his secret  BNP past, it is clear Mr Weldon is unsuitable for a position in our national broadcaster.’ A BBC spokesman said last night that Mr Weldon ‘is a highly respected professional who has assured us he has not been a member of the BNP’.","Economics reporter Duncan Weldon was part of BNP campaign in 2000 .

Another said it was lucky no children were on top them having a ride, which is what the animals are used for.

Television station KMOV reports that the . female elephants escaped from the children's ride section of the Moolah . Shrine Circus at the Family Arena in St. Charles, Missouri, about 5pm. Police have confirmed three elephants escaped the Shrine Circus in Missouri on Saturday afternoon, roaming the carpark and damaging multiple cars before trainers were able to occupy them between some trailers (pictured) Multiple cars were damaged, however no one at the circus was injured. Police added that the elephants damaged the venue's loading door . A circus official said the three elephants got away from their enclosure, went under a garage door and then walked around the parking lot damaging two campers and two pick-up trucks belonging to circus employees . The animals are said to have burst past some parked RV trailers and made their way to the parking lot. 'Things started shaking, When I looked up I saw three elephants coming toward us,' Sally Schmiz, a witness to the event, said. 'These huge elephants literally went through these huge RVs. 'Then they went through two trucks breaking mirrors off, and panels off and breaking the windows.' Police said they also damaged the venue's loading door. Circus officials confirmed the elephants got loose and are the ones used for children's rides. However they were tight-lipped on further details.

The fragile Tory truce over Europe disintegrated last night after it emerged that more than 100 Conservative MPs and candidates are set to defy David Cameron at the General Election next year by vowing to leave the EU. The Prime Minister has promised the Tory manifesto will spell out his pledge for a referendum by 2017 on Britain’s links with Europe after trying to win back key powers from Brussels. But Tory rebels will go further and make their own personal manifesto vows to campaign to withdraw from the EU – regardless of any concessions by Brussels. David Cameron faces the threat of at least 100 of his own MPs vowing to leave the EU after the next election. Kent MP Mark Reckless (right) says Britain should leave whatever deal is struck with the EU . It is a major rebuff for Mr Cameron, who hoped his referendum commitment would stop open warfare over Europe during the campaign. The rebels were to declare their provocative plan after May’s European Parliament elections, when they are expected to lose seats to UKIP, but the move was leaked to The Mail on Sunday. The rebels say Mr Cameron should not accuse them of disloyalty because when he first stood for Parliament in 1997, then Prime Minister John Major begged Tory candidates to back his pledge not to have his hands tied on whether Britain should join the proposed euro, which was launched in 1999. Mr Cameron was among many who refused, pledging to rule out joining the single currency.Rochester Tory MP Mark Reckless said last night he would vow to vote to quit the EU – and ignore  Mr Cameron’s plan to renegotiate membership. Rebel MPs say their stand is similar to Mr Cameron's own stance on John Major's demands on the euro in 1999 . Mr Reckless, currently conducting his own EU referendum in his Kent constituency, said: ‘There is no prospect of being able to remake the EU in a way that is acceptable to Britain. We are going to have an in/out referendum by 2017 and I will vote to come out.’ Another Conservative MP, who asked not to be named, said: ‘We will loyally refer to Mr Cameron’s hopes of a new settlement with Brussels in our manifestos, but the message will be clear – vote for us and we will vote to get our sovereignty back and go it alone without the dead hand of Brussels.’ A third Tory said: ‘When it suited Mr Cameron to make a firm statement against the euro in his 1997 manifesto... he went ahead and did it. So will we. He would not be so ill-judged to try to stop us, as it would leave him vulnerable to the charge of hypocrisy.’","Scores of MPs set to defy their leader and promise voters an EU exit .

"By . Glen Owen . David Cameron’s decision to delay the State Opening of Parliament by a month because he has run out of policies has caused a clash with Buckingham Palace – after courtiers warned it could overburden the Queen, who turns 88 next month. They objected after the Prime Minister told the Palace he intended to move the Queen’s Speech to June 4, giving her and Prince Philip – 93 on June 10 –just 24 hours to recover before they travel to France for a three-day visit to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day. Downing Street then suggested bringing the Queen’s Speech forward a day to June 3 – only for the Palace to point out it would clash with a garden party she is hosting. Scroll down for video . David Cameron's changes to the State Opening of Parliament mean the Queen faces an 'extremely busy' week . After what a Palace spokesman last night described as a ‘constructive dialogue’, the Queen eventually agreed to June 3 after being told there was no other date available and that failing to choose one would cause a constitutional crisis. It means the Queen will face a gruelling five days. She will attend the State Opening of Parliament and read the Queen’s Speech, which sets out the Government’s legislation for the coming year. She will then return to the Palace that afternoon and host the garden party a couple of hours later. After a single day off, dominated by briefings on her D-Day trip, she and the Duke of Edinburgh will set off for France. The Coalition’s critics say its lack of policies has created a ‘zombie Parliament’, with most MPs attending Parliament for just a couple of days a week, and the Queen’s Speech being pushed back while Ministers think of ideas to fill it. Political issues mean the Queen will have to speak in parliament on the day of a Palace garden party, shortly before she travels to France . MPs on all sides last night accused the Government of showing ‘poor manners’ to the Queen for forcing her to change her diary at short notice. ‘The Queen and Prince Philip have understandably scaled back their appearances because of their increasing age, yet the Government is putting them under needless strain to spare its own blushes,’ said one senior parliamentarian. ‘It is rude and disrespectful. Consideration for the Queen should take priority over political embarrassment.’ The news comes at a time when Royal officials have been trying to curb some of her more onerous responsibilities. It was announced last year that the Queen and Prince Philip, who have both recently suffered illness, would be cutting back on their overseas travel; the visit to France will be one of just two foreign trips they carry out in 2014. The government insists the Queen was given 'good notice' of the change of schedule, but Labour MP Chris Bryant (right) said ministers had 'failed to consult' the monarch . The Royal couple will travel to meet President Francois Hollande, staying at the Elysee Palace, attending state events in Paris and continuing on to Normandy for the commemorations on June 6. Their visit will coincide with a mass parachute drop by 16 Air Assault Brigade to mark the liberation of Ranville, the first village to be freed from the Nazis in 1944. The event will be followed by a memorial service. Last night a Palace source said the Government had told courtiers that the reason for the delay was to avoid a clash with the European elections in May. Sceptics, however, point out that the EU elections have been in the calendar for years. A Palace spokesman would say only: ‘We understood why the Government wanted to move the date.’ A Buckingham Palace spokesman said 'constitutional proprieties' were extremely important to the Queen and her staff . When asked whether the Palace had objected to the Queen delivering the speech the day before she is due to travel, the spokesman said: ‘It is an extremely busy time. ‘We made it clear that the Queen would be leaving for the D-Day celebrations on the 5th, and had a very constructive dialogue on that basis. At all times we were guided by the constitutional proprieties.’ A Government spokesman said: ‘The June date has been in the diary for a while now and we made sure that the Palace was given good notice. We were aware that the Queen was planning to travel to the D-Day commemorations later that week. ‘We know the Queen has a very busy diary and we have been sensitive to that fact.’ Labour frontbench MP Chris Bryant said: ‘The Government had four years to work out when this year’s State Opening would take place, and the one person they failed to consult was the one without whom it could not take place – the Queen. ‘This may be a zombie Parliament, but even the undead normally show better manners.’ When The Mail on Sunday first revealed the delay, one Tory Minister said it had arisen because Mr Cameron had ‘ripped up’ the proposed programme of legislation, saying it was ‘not sexy enough’.","Government moved State Opening of Parliament due to lack of policies .

"By . Sam Creighton . Everyone hopes to one day own their dream home but, short of winning the lottery, it an aspiration out of most peoples' grasp. However, one young woman has found an ingenious of overcoming these financial obstacles - by building her perfect home in a garage. Keen designer Stephanie Bertenshaw shelled out just £15,000 designing and renovating the five garages on her parents' land and the new home has now valued at £150,000. Miss Bertenshaw and her partner Luke Stanley, both 24, live in the transformed three bed house at The Old Coach House in Marsden, West Yorkshire - land that is also home to Stephanie's parents Chris and Suzanne, her grandparents and her uncle. Scroll down for video . Stephanie Bertenshaw, 24, has built her dream house by converting five garages on land owned by her parents . Miss Bertenshaw, who lives in the house with her two dogs, Lola and Ben, pictured, settled on a Spanish style for the outside . The site before the converseion. Miss Bertenshaw spent £15,000 on the project but the home has now been valued at ten times that amount . Miss Bertenshaw, left, has always had a flair for design, she said she lost her deposit on several rented properties because she would decorate them. It is this drive to create herself the perfect home that made the project so appealing. Friends and family all pitched in with the labouring, right, to help keeps costs down . She said: 'I originally started my online business from home, which is where I still work now. 'I was living at home to save money while working as a teaching assistant and running the business. I used to stare at the garages and think ""they could be so much better"". 'I've always rented properties in the past and I could never help doing renovations on them. In fact I never got my deposits back because I always ended up painting rooms. 'My parents owned the garages and said that I could do what I wanted with them. It took two years for the row of garages to be transformed from cluttered workshops into a picturesque three-bedroom home . The garages are on land which is also home to Miss Bertenshaw's parents and grandparents, she says this is perfect as she is quite a homely person . Miss Bertenshaw, who was living at home before launching the conversion project, said she used to stare at the garages thinking 'they could be so much better' Miss Bertenshaw used the image editing software Photoshop to try different designs for the outside of the house, the Spanish theme is nothing like her original intentions . Miss Bertenshaw runs her own business from home, specialising in selling art, prints and homeware . The house was featured on the television programme Kirstie's Best of Both Worlds with Kirstie Allsopp, after Miss Bertenshaw submitted a photo on Facebook . 'I'm quite a stay at home person and I like homely things and it just seemed silly to waste money on rent when I could convert the garages. 'I've tried to be hands on as much as possible. I was always collecting pictures of design ideas that I liked, and even though I look back and think I could have done some things differently I absolutely love the result.' Miss Bertenshaw's eye for design can be seen throughout the open plan house. A light and airy living room with hard wood floors is now where a dirty workbench once stood. A lot of effort went in to making the house as light and airy as possible, it's almost unrecognisable from the dark workshops that were there before . The three-bedroom home has been valued at £150,000, it is on the grounds of The Old Coach House in Marsden, Yorkshire . Before converting the garages, Miss Bertenshaw was living at home and working as a teaching assistant in order to save money . Since completing the house, Stephanie has added an extension to create a workshop for her craft business . And one cluttered garage filled with dust is now a beautiful country style kitchen. The exterior of the house was not what Stephanie originally had in mind, but after playing with designs she settled on the Spanish style. She said: 'I was 22 when we started the work. I started using Photoshop to design and play around with ideas about what the house would look like. 'I would see some things that I thought would look great and then really they were actually a bit rubbish. 'I roughed out the designs of what I wanted it to look like and helped with a lot of the labouring work. Everyone mucked in to help, especially my parents. Miss Bertenshaw said: 'I'm quite a stay at home person and I like homely things and it just seemed silly to waste money on rent when I could convert the garages' Because her parents owned the garages to begin with, Miss Bertwnshaw lives in the house rent and mortgage free . The country style kitchen, which takes the place of one of the entire garages, is a highlight for Miss Bertenshaw . Looking back, Miss Bertenshaw says she would do some things different but that she still 'loves the result' 'It took two years, lots of hard graft and a keen eye for bargains to furnish it but now I have a perfect, mortgage-free home for me, my fabulous boyfriend and my two dogs Lola and Ben.' Stephanie's new home has also put her in the TV spotlight when she appeared on a show presented by Kirstie Allsopp. She added: 'To top it all off, I decided to send off a little picture of my home to a ""take part"" post I saw from Kirstie's Facebook Page. 'They said they were looking for unique homes that are ""The Best of Both Worlds"" and little did I ever think I would be accepted.' Since completing the house, Stephanie has added an extension to create a workshop for her craft business. Stephanie works from the workshop running her business, Felt Mountain Studios, specialising in handmade gifts, stationery, art, prints and homeware.","Stephanie Bertenshaw, 24, spent £15,000 converting five garages at her parents' Yorkshire home .

"By . Sam Creighton . A college basketball star has been suspended from his team after being arrested twice in one day for allegedly assaulting his roommate. Zach Price, 20, who plays as a forward for Missouri University, has been banned from the court after the arrests, both over altercations involving his 23-year-old roommate and a 23-year-old woman. Price was charged with third-degree assault and third-degree domestic assault following his first arrest by Columbia Police at 2.31am yesterday morning. Zach Price after his first arrest in the early hours of Thursday morning on charges of assault . By the time of his second arrest, just over 12 hours later, the basketball star had changed outfits . The . victims claim that Price was following their car in his own and blocked . the road to prevent them from leaving the area. The 6' 10"" athlete is . then alleged to have punched his roommate in the face and pushed the . woman to the ground when she tried to intervene. Later in the day, at 3.05pm, he was arrested again, this time on charges of second-degree assault and second-degree domestic assault, relating to an incident on Wednesday afternoon, where he is alleged to have twice rammed his car into a vehicle holding the same two people. Missouri University's basketball coach, Frank Haith, told the Kansas City Star after the first arrest: 'We’re very disappointed in his actions. We’re still gathering information — been up all night and we’re still working toward finding out what all went on. I can tell that you we’re not real happy and we will discipline accordingly.' The university later confirmed in a statement: 'We are aware of the situation involving Zach Price and per department policy, he is suspended immediately.' After his first arrest, Price posted a $1,500 bond to be released from Boone City Jail. Then, after the second arrest, he had to post another $9,000 bond. Each third degree charge carries with it a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $1,000 fine, while each second-degree offence is punishable by five years in prison and a fine of $5,000. This means that, if found guilty of all charges, Price could face 16 years behind bars and a $12,000 fine. Price transferred to Missouri from the championship winning Louisville team last season. As per transfer guidelines, he sat out last year but, the year before that, he started seven games for Louisville and averaged 1.4 points and 1.2 rebounds per game.

"By . Jack Doyle . and Stephen Wright . and Chris Greenwood . The secretive police union is today told to put its house in order or face tough new laws forcing it to reform. Police minister Damian Green says the Police Federation must open its books and make public details of accounts containing millions of pounds. The Federation – still reeling from the fallout from Plebgate, its political campaigning and revelations about credit card spending and off-shore accounts – must also enact 'genuine and sustained change', he says. Fiona McElroy, former head of communications at the Police Federation, giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee . A failure to do so means the Government 'will have to act instead, in the interests both of the police and the public', he said. His strongly-worded intervention comes  after it emerged that the Federation paid a controversial PR firm for advice on using 'guerrilla tactics' against the Government in the run-up to the Plebgate scandal. The strategy also called for a 'blitzkrieg' to halt government plans to reform pay and conditions for officers. Yesterday a former senior official at the Federation, Fiona McElroy, told MPs about the bullying, boozy, spendthrift culture at the organisation's £26million headquarters in Leatherhead, Surrey. Miss McElroy, who says she was unfairly dismissed by Federation bosses after advocating reform, confirmed that it had paid a PR firm thousands of pounds for advice. Scandal: Andrew Mitchell leaves after meeting Police Federation representatives at his constituency office in Sutton Coldfield . It also emerged: . ■ Current Federation chairman Steve Williams considered resigning after he had been 'bullied and ridiculed' by colleagues; . ■ A member of staff was sent a  'personally abusive' email late one Friday night by another individual at the Federation; . ■ Miss McElroy came under  'personal attack' from officials in the aftermath of a withering report on  the organisation; . ■ She was warned through intermediaries – including two ex colleagues – that she could face legal action over giving evidence to MPs; . ■ Literature issued by the PR firm also outlined in detail how it skilfully exploited Plebgate for the Federation's political ends. Mr Green's warning to the Federation comes in an article for the union's in-house magazine, Police. In it, he writes he is most concerned about 'financial propriety' around so-called 'number 2 accounts' held by local branches. These are thought to contain tens of millions of pounds and details of their contents were not declared to the Normington Review – a report by former Home Office mandarin Sir David Normington which also recommended radical change. He says the Federation must show its members how 'every penny' of both their and the public's money is spent and calls for 'full transparency' on spending. Northampton MP Michael Ellis questioned Miss McElroy at the home affairs committee . Mr Green says the Federation has a responsibility to ensure money is spent 'sensibly and transparently'. 'Any officer at any time should be able to know where every penny of their money has gone,' he said. And he warns that no organisation 'can expect to abuse public trust or members' resources'. Mr Green said: 'I would prefer the Federation to decide how they do it themselves to the timetable set by David Normington. If they do not,  we stand prepared to take action  if necessary.' Miss McElroy's testimony before the Home Affairs Select Committee yesterday will also heap pressure on the Federation to modernise. She confirmed details of a secret plot outlined in a £10,000-a-month contract handed to a public relations company run by former DJ Jon Gaunt. This was weeks before the Plebgate incident in September 2012 involving then Government chief whip Andrew Mitchell and a policeman at the gates of Downing Street. Mr Mitchell has always denied calling Downing Street police officers '****ing plebs', insisting the row was hijacked by Federation officials for political ends. Under questioning from Tory MP Michael Ellis, Miss McElroy – sacked as head of communications at the Federation in February – confirmed she had seen the contract. She said: 'I was aware of a contract that had been put in place. The reason I came across it was when I joined the organisation and I was trying to understand where the risks were.' She confirmed she had seen the words 'guerrilla tactics' in the contract, but did not recall seeing 'blitzkrieg'. Other sources confirm that 'blitzkrieg' was in the document. Literature issued by Mr Gaunt's firm has also outlined in detail how it exploited Plebgate for the Federation's political ends. Miss McElroy added: 'I said there are much more sophisticated ways to engage and debate without making it personal, aggressive, hostile and still achieve the same aims.' Miss McElroy said the chairman of the Federation Steve Williams 'was considering his own position and was asking me to help him on how to move in that way' after the Normington Report on the organisation was published in January. She said: 'He had personally been criticised, verbally ridiculed, attacked and bullied.' On bullying, she said was confronted in a bar by a colleague at 10pm when 'much alcohol had been consumed'. She said there were no rules about how Federation corporate credit cards were used. She said there was a meeting of Federation reps from across the UK when they ran up bills of 'some £300 or £400'. Both the Police Federation and former Sun columnist Mr Gaunt, 53, have refused to discuss the 'guerrilla tactics' contract.","Damian Green says the Police Federation must open up .

"By . Simon Walters . and Glen Owen . A Tory Minister is involved in an extraordinary row over claims that taxpayers’ money was used to fund gay sex parties. The politician is said to have been in a feud with a senior party official accused of using dating app Grindr to invite gay MPs and activists to his suite at the Conservative Party conference. The £70,000-a-year official, who is not an MP, has also been accused of bullying staff and being drunk on duty. He was disciplined after a formal investigation. The £2,500 per night Manchester hotel where the orgy is said to have taken place . Neither the Minister nor the official can be named by The Mail on Sunday for legal reasons. The gay sex party is alleged to have taken place at the Light ApartHotel, a luxury apartment complex in Manchester where suites cost up to £2,500 a night. It is just over half a mile from the Manchester Central conference centre and is popular with footballers and WAGs. The complex can be entered by driving straight into the underground car park, escaping the attentions of the paparazzi. The official was among a group of Tory aides who stayed there during the conference in 2011 with the bill being footed by a taxpayer-funded organisation. The Tory official organised the party using the Grindr app, which enables users to make contact with fellow gay men in the vicinity. After a series of intimate exchanges with another man, he invited him to a party in his hotel suite. It is alleged that other men were later invited. According to one source, the official boasted he was a senior figure in the Tory Party. Rumours of several unseemly scandals that are yet to break have been compared to the underhanded politics of television show House of Cards . A source, who has seen the Grindr messages, said: ‘The gist of it was, “I’m up here with the Tory Party and have some great young guys in my suite. We party every night, come and join us.” ‘The other man responded very enthusiastically and said he was also involved in politics so they had lots in common.’ Shortly after the conference, a formal complaint was made to the party by an individual who saw the Grindr exchanges between the named official and the other man, who did not disclose his identity. John Bercow is planning emergency talks with MPs in an attempt to defuse any impending crisis . A Tory insider said: ‘It was clear from the investigation that the official had behaved very foolishly and he was given a formal warning. ‘But it was decided to take no further action. The identity of the other man in the Grindr messages was not disclosed in the inquiry.’ The result of the investigation was reported to Downing Street. The Mail on Sunday has also learned that in the run-up to the 2011 Tory conference, the same official was involved in a separate incident when the Conservative politician involved in the feud asked him to approve a big pay rise for one of his friends, who worked for the the official. The official refused, insisting that because the Tory body that he and the Minister’s friend worked for receives public funds they had to follow Mr Cameron’s call for public-sector workers to receive low pay rises in line with the Coalition’s austerity policies. Tory chiefs backed the official and told the Minister to stop making a fuss. The Minister allegedly complained vehemently again when the same male junior aide was passed over for promotion and ‘raved and ranted about it in front of other Tory officials causing an embarrassing scene’. The claims were disclosed following a Mail on Sunday investigation amid speculation at Westminster that a new sleaze scandal involving Tory MPs, sex, abuse of power, bullying and personal feuds is about to be exposed. A parliamentary insider said some of the ‘outlandish and sinister’ claims and counter claims were reminiscent of the TV political drama House Of Cards about the plots, sexual intrigue and vendettas in the Westminster underworld. David Cameron has been warned the allegations could inflict major damage on his party’s reputation. Commons Speaker John Bercow, who is responsible for the conduct of all MPs and staff at Westminster, is planning emergency talks with senior MPs this week in attempt to defuse the crisis. Last week, the Speaker sent all MPs a copy of an ‘anti-bullying charter’ designed to protect Commons staff who claim they have been ‘harassed’ by MPs or officials. He is furious that his demand for a ‘helpline’ to allow MPs’ staff to report bullying and harassment was rejected by all three main parties. The charter says they must stop all forms of ‘harassment – unwanted conduct that violates people’s dignity’ while ‘remarks based on race, gender, sexual orientation and gender reassignment’  are banned.’ One official said: ‘There has been concern for some time over some MPs with a conspicuously high turnover of staff.’","A Tory official allegedly hosted a gay sex orgy while at party conference .

"By . Simon Walters . and Brendan Carlin . The feuding in Labour’s high command intensified last night after Harriet Harman and Ed Balls were caught plotting against Ed Miliband’s embattled elections chief. Party deputy Ms Harman and the Shadow Chancellor discussed criticism of Douglas Alexander in a close huddle outside Mr Balls’s Commons office on Wednesday. According to a reliable eyewitness, Ms Harman said to Mr Balls: ‘The trouble with Douglas is that he just isn’t engaged at the moment.’ Mr Balls reportedly nodded in reply. Plot: Ed Balls and Harriet Harman were caught plotting against Ed Miliband’s embattled elections chief . Feud: The feuding in the Labour party has intensified after Harman and Balls were caught plotting . Asked last night whether Ms Harman had called Mr Alexander ‘not engaged’, her spokeswoman replied: ‘We are not responding to this.’ The comment is the latest evidence of the bitter rift in Mr Miliband’s Shadow Cabinet that threatens to wreck his General Election strategy. Mr Alexander is accused of blocking bids to persuade Mr Miliband to adopt radical new policies. He believes Labour should ‘play safe’ and rely on UKIP to split the Tory vote. But a growing number of critics say the economic revival means Labour must do more to oust David Cameron. Mr Alexander, Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman, has been the subject of an increasingly hostile campaign by Labour foes. The row has united Ms Harman and Mr Balls, the most senior members of Mr Miliband’s team. Ms Harman has complained privately that Mr Alexander ‘is keeping me out’ of vital discussions on Labour tactics. Unpopular: According to a reliable eyewitness, Ms Harman said to Mr Balls: 'The trouble with Douglas is that he just isn't engaged at the moment.' And Mr Balls and Mr Alexander loathe each other: as The Mail on Sunday reported earlier this year, they have come close to blows and had to be physically dragged apart by Tessa Jowell. The schism has led to the worst Labour infighting since Mr Miliband beat older brother David to become leader in 2010. And it has reignited personal squabbles that go back to the Blair-Brown era. Critics of Mr Alexander accuse him of being ‘absurdly cautious’ and a ‘control freak’. They blame his allies for the disclosure that Barack Obama election guru Arnie Graf, brought over from the US to advise Mr Miliband, did not have a work permit. Mr Alexander’s camp reject the claims. The Mail on Sunday revealed last week how Labour strategy chief Michael Dugher threatened to resign, telling Mr Miliband that Mr Alexander was ‘impossible’ to work with. A senior Labour figure said: ‘Douglas thinks he is cleverer than everyone else and won’t talk to anyone. His personal communication skills are zero. He is out of step with nearly everyone around him and it is starting to destablilize the leader’s office. ‘He gives the impression he knows more about strategy than anyone else but he ran campaigns for Gordon Brown and David Miliband and made a mess of both of them. It doesn’t help that Ed Miliband doesn’t have the authority to knock heads together.’","Feuding in Labour's high command has intensified over Ed Miliband's embattled election chief .

"By . Simon Walters, Mail on Sunday Political Editor . Ex-Tory Minister Michael Fabricant went public yesterday to denounce claims that he was in ‘a feud’ with Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU) boss Iain Corby. Mr Fabricant, sacked as Tory vice-chairman last week, revealed he told party chiefs of concerns about the PRU’s ‘drinking culture’ three years ago – but no action was taken. He complained to senior Tory MP Oliver Heald, former chairman of the PRU, after he was approached by two PRU officials who complained about boozing in the PRU. Speaking out: Michael Fabricant (left) has revealed he told party chiefs of concerns about the PRU's 'drinking culture' three years ago. He also said a PRU aide was called a 'whip's nark' in earshot of Philip Dunne (right) According to Mr Fabricant, one PRU aide was called a ‘whip’s nark’ by Mr Corby, in the hearing of a senior Minister. This newspaper has established that the Minister was Philip Dunne, then a whip and now a Defence Minister. Mr Fabricant volunteered a statement to The Mail on Sunday to rebut claims that he was in a ‘feud’ with Mr Corby. He said: ‘There is no feud. In 2011, I met with two members of PRU staff, both of whom felt that activities in the PRU at the time fell far below the standards expected of a professional employer. 'One of them made the case that he is neither gay nor willing to involve himself in a culture of long drinking sessions. Partying: Mr Fabricant volunteered a statement to The Mail on Sunday to rebut claims that he was in a 'feud' with Iain Corby, who has quit as boss of the PRU. Above Mr Corby (left) is pictured with an unidentified man . ‘He believed he was not being treated fairly despite his annual reviews saying his work was outstanding. Others had received modest pay rises while he had not. 'He had even been told in front of a Minister that he was a “whip’s nark” or whistleblower. As a consequence he left for a better job. I reported this to the appropriate authorities and that was that.’ Senior Tory sources have told this newspaper that Mr Corby was also the subject of a complaint concerning an allegation that he had returned to work after a boozy lunch, when a PRU aide was discussing a crucial Commons vote on the EU with a senior Foreign Office mandarin. Furious: Strategist Lynton Crosby (pictured) was furious when Mr Fabricant said he was having an affair with a llama but refused to reveal its gender . Mr Corby allegedly grabbed the phone and made scrawled notes. The incident was witnessed by Mr Dunne who was said to be furious. In a Tory inquiry into Mr Corby’s conduct, he defended himself saying he was not officially on duty that day and was trying to be helpful. As evidence of his condition, the inquiry was given a sheet of Mr Corby’s scrawled notes made when he spoke to the FO mandarin. The Mail on Sunday has copy of his notes. Mr Corby was told to improve his behaviour. PRU sources say  his behaviour subsequently improved markedly. The intervention by Mr Fabricant adds to the increasingly bizarre nature of certain aspects of the so called ‘sexminster’ row to hit the  Tories at Westminster. It has been likened to Tory peer Michael Dobbs’ House Of Cards TV political thriller set in Parliament – and by a quirk of fate, Mr Fabricant was ‘political adviser’ to the film. Mr Fabricant was fired last week as deputy Tory chairman, reportedly for a series of hostile messages about expenses scandal MP Maria Miller, culminating in one saying ‘about time’ when she resigned as Culture Secretary. David Cameron’s Australian-born strategist Lynton Crosby was furious when Mr Fabricant, in response to someone who asked him about his sexuality, said he was having an affair with a llama but refused to reveal its gender. Mr Crosby is said to have protested: ‘We cannot have a f****** deputy chairman who believes in bestiality.’ Some Tories believe Mr Fabricant’s complaints about the PRU were also a factor in his dismissal by Conservative chairman Grant Shapps.","Michael Fabricant has revealed he told officials about Tory 'drinking culture'

"By . Glen Owen, Mail on Sunday Political Correspondent . A Labour parliamentary candidate backed by Harriet Harman was last night kicked out of the party after The Mail on Sunday discovered she had posted a string of obscene and vitriolic messages on Twitter. Deborah Hopkins used the social networking site to accuse the Conservatives of ‘killing the sick’ and ‘starving the disabled’, claimed a Government department was using ‘starvation’ to control the population, and described the British Empire as ‘genocide’. She even used an extremely offensive swear word to attack an opponent, writing: ‘I’d call you a **** but you have neither the depth or the warmth.’ Deborah Hopkins, the Labour parliamentary candidate who was supported by Harriet Harman . Ms Hopkins, who was due to stand for St Austell and Newquay in next year’s General Election, addressed last year’s party conference in Brighton and has been publicly supported by Ms Harman and her husband Jack Dromey, the Shadow Housing Minister. After meeting Ed Miliband and shaking his hand, she wrote: ‘May never wash that hand again.’ Both Ms Harman – Labour’s Deputy Leader – and Mr Dromey have posed for pictures with Ms Hopkins, with Mr Dromey posting a message on Twitter describing her as ‘a great champion of Cornwall’. But after this newspaper brought Ms Hopkins’s offensive messages to the attention of Labour’s high command yesterday, she was suspended from the party – rendering her ineligible to contest the election. Ms Hopkins, a 47-year-old single mother with a teenage son, posted the messages after being selected to fight the seat last autumn. In October, she reacted to the news that the Coalition had voted down planned firearms restrictions with the message: ‘Murdering b*******’. A few weeks later, when the Conservatives published their goals for society, such as ‘caring for one’s neighbour and good manners’, Ms Hopkins responded with her own mock slogan: ‘Killing the sick, starving the disabled, evicting the poor, destroying the hopes of children, stealing billions from the public’. In the same month, during a debate . over Britain’s imperial past, she accused a fellow Twitter user of being . ‘proud of the genocide that was and is Empire. Sickening.’ And earlier . this year she asked whether Iain Duncan Smith’s Department for Work and . Pensions was using benefit cuts to try to achieve ‘population control by . starvation’. Ms Hopkins, a . healthcare assistant, has already admitted that she voted for the local . sitting MP, Liberal Democrat Stephen Gilbert, at the last election – but . claimed it was because she ‘believed their lies and believed it was the . only way to keep the Tories out’. Deborah Hopkins accused the Conservatives of killing the sick and starving the disabled . She said she decided to stand for election after meeting Mr Dromey last May and being ‘inspired’ by his anger upon hearing how she struggled to make ends meet. ‘I was very frustrated by some politicians who didn’t seem angry enough about what was going on,’ she said. ‘I thought, “If you’re allowed to be a politician and still be angry, then it might be for me.” ’ In a statement last night, Ms Hopkins said: ‘I appreciate the language used in some of my tweets is offensive and not appropriate. I don’t wish to embarrass the Labour Party and apologise for any offence caused.’ A Labour spokesperson said: ‘We take matters such as these extremely seriously. Deborah Hopkins has been suspended from the Labour Party, pending further investigation.’ Tory MP Henry Smith said Ms Hopkins’s behaviour called into question the judgment of her supporters. ‘This vile and malicious language is unacceptable from a woman who was seeking to take on the huge privilege of representing the people of St Austell and Newquay,’ he said. ‘This calls into question the judgment of Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey, who publicly supported Ms Hopkins’s candidacy. They should be much more careful about whom they select in future.’","Deborah Hopkins used social network to post vile and obscene messages .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Battle: The trial over the fortune of Huguette Clark, pictured, could now go ahead on Thursday . The sprawling, Connecticut estate of heiress Huguette Clark has finally been sold after almost a decade on the market. Clark, a famous recluse never spent a single night in the place, also known as Le Beau Chateau, after buying it in 1952. The new buyers finalized the deal Monday and got the home for $14.3 million, well under half the original $34 million asking price. Clark had always said that the house was bought to 'get away from the horrors' of nuclear war, according to a great-half-nephew. New Canaan News is reported in February that there was a sale pending on the 1937 chateau-style home. That sale has now been made official, though the identity of the buyer remains undisclosed. Le Beau Chateau, as Clark's estate was called, was listed at $15.9 million after being slashed from $34 million. The nine-bedroom, eleven-fireplace mansion sits on a 52-acre estate. However, the residence and the grounds need extensive renovation and restoration. Real Estalker says that fashion designer and former Coach executive Reed Krakoff and his wife, interior designer Delphine Krakoff, who just sold their Upper East Side mansion for an astounding $51 million, are the proud new owners.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Guilty: Sir Young, 20, (pictured) admitted to raping a 14-year-old girl at a Texas high school in 2011 when he was 18 . A Texas judge has sparked national outrage after implying a 14-year-old rape victim was promiscuous and was not 'the victim she claimed to be'. State District Judge Jeanine Howard this week stunned the court by sentencing self-confessed rapist, Sir Young, to a mild 45-day prison term and five year probation, instead of the maximum 20-year jail stint. Young, 20, pleaded guilty to raping the . girl at Booker T. Washington High School, Dallas, in 2011 when he was . 18, even as she cried out 'no' and 'stop'. While Young will be labeled a sex offender for life, Howard exempted him from standard sex offender restrictions: he doesn't have to stay away from children, attend sex offender treatment, undergo a sex offender evaluation or refrain from watching pornography. Howard told Dallas News she issued the light sentence based partially on medical records which indicated the girl had three sexual partners and had given birth to a baby. She also described Young as 'not your typical sex offender'. 'My job is not to make people happy. My job is to follow the Constitution and do the right thing. I will always do the right thing,' she said. However the ruling has shocked and devastated the victim, now 17, who denies having ever been pregnant. 'I have never been pregnant ever,' she told WFAA. 'And three partners? I don’t even know where she got this. I feel like this was her way of trying to make herself feel better.' She said she was just starting to come to terms with the rape and her decision to prosecute her attacker, until she heard Howard's comments. 'It was a slap in the face,' she said. 'I thought I was going to get help. I thought that it would be taken care of, and I wouldn’t have to worry about it anymore.' She had testified during the trial that she said 'no' and 'stop' during the assault and had only wanted to kiss him. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Dallas Judge Jeanine Howard (pictured) caused outrage when she implied that the 14-year-old rape victim was promiscuous, saying 'the victim she claimed to be' The victim also said she regrets coming forward about the 2011 assault. 'I did what I was supposed to do. I went to the law about this situation,' she said. '(But the sentence) that says everything I went through was for nothing.' She added: 'It would have been better for me not to say anything. Young, meanwhile, testified last week that he is engaged and his fiancée is pregnant. They plan to get married on her birthday in November, according to Dallas News. He also reportedly is about to start a new job. Scene: Booker T. Washington High School (pictured), where Sir Young raped a 14-year-old girl, has since added a window to the room where the rape happened . Although Judge Howard publicly declared her sentence was appropriate, she has been criticized by parts of the legal community and advocates for sexual assault victims. Her requirement that Young complete community service at a local rape crisis sentence has caused particular outrage. Bobbie Villareal, executive director of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center, said she refuses to welcome Young. 'I’m sure she (jUDGE Howard) probably thought that it was his way of giving back perhaps,' she told WFAA. 'But it’s just not an appropriate place for him to do his community supervision.' Villareal slammed the 'lenient' conditions passed down by Judge Howard, who is known in legal circles for her creative approach to sentencing. Rejected: Judge Jeanine Howard ordered rapist Sir Young to undertake community service at Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center (pictured). Management said he wasn't welcome . Taking a stand: Bobbie Villareal (pictured), executive director of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center, said the center is 'just not an appropriate place for him (Sir Young) to do his community supervision' 'It is a deterrent to all survivors when you see a very lenient sentence like this passed down,' Villareal told WFAA. 'It sends a devastating message to survivors of sexual assault. That victim’s family definitely didn’t feel like there was justice for her and for other survivors of sexual assault.' Young's sentence of deferred adjudication probation means that if he meets various terms laid down by Judge Howard, he will not have a permanent criminal record. As well as the community service order, he must also spend 45 days in jail, as well as a further 24 hours in jail every October 4 - the date of the rape - for the duration of his probation. Howard removed herself from the case on Friday, and a new judge has taken over. During the trial, the court heard that Young and the girl were kissing in a practice room at the performing arts school, but that she had told him to stop when he began rubbing her body. Ignoring her pleas, he instead pulled off her leggings and raped her. 'I didn’t want to do anything other than kiss,' the victim told the court, adding that she had told Young 'no' and 'stop' before and during the attack. Booker T. Washington High School has since added a window to the room and installed CCTV cameras.","Sir Young, 20, admitted to raping a 14-year-old girl at a Texas high school in 2011 when he was 18 .

The accuser's father was sentenced to more than ten years in prison after a fellow gang member gave evidence against him. The ‘supergrass’ is in a witness protection scheme in case his former associates try to take revenge on him. One of the young men who made sexual assault allegations against former Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans is the son of a gangster . Neither the identity of the gangster, nor the extraordinary details of the case, can be revealed because it could lead to the breach of the anonymity granted to the accuser when he made his claims against the MP. The accuser remains close to his father – who has now been released from prison – and recently posted a picture on a social networking site showing the pair embracing. Mr Evans, 56, was charged with one count of rape, five of sexual assault, one attempted sexual assault and two indecent assaults, but was unanimously cleared of all charges by a  jury at Preston Crown Court earlier this month. In last week’s Mail on Sunday, Mr Evans called for a review of the anonymity rules that allowed his seven male accusers to keep their identities secret while he has been reduced to personal and financial ruin.

"By . Glen Owen . Ryan Coetzee, pictured, who has been given the job of rescuing Liberal Democrat poll ratings . Nick Clegg’s controversial taxpayer-funded election strategist was censured  by a watchdog over his role in the awarding of a multi-million-pound contract. Ryan Coetzee, who has been given the £110,000-a-year job of rescuing the Lib Dems’ plunging poll ratings, was accused of ‘maladministration’ in an official probe into suspected cronyism. Mr Coetzee, who arrived at Westminster after nearly 20 years in South African politics, was at the centre of a pay row  last week when it emerged that, unlike his rival Labour and Conservative election gurus, his salary comes from public rather than party funds. Intrigue has followed him around in his native country, where he started his career in 1997 as a 24-year-old strategist for the Democratic Party. He went on to serve as an MP and chief executive of the party and then advised Helen Zille, premier of the Western Cape province. Last year South Africa’s Public Protector, an anti-corruption watchdog, investigated Mr Coetzee’s role in the awarding of a £4 million communications contract by Ms Zille’s government to a company called TBWA Hunt Lascaris. The Protector, Thuli Madonsela, launched her investigation after a whistleblower raised questions about why the contract had been awarded without being publicly advertised, as required by law. An interim report said Mr Coetzee’s role in drafting the tender specifications for the contract, then evaluating the bid and not taking proper minutes, was illegal and should lead to disciplinary action. After Mr Coetzee’s team mounted a legal challenge, the conclusion was that his involvement was ‘improper’ and he had been implicated in ‘maladministration’. The controversial taxpayer-funded election strategist of Nick Clegg, pictured, was censured by a watchdog over his role in the awarding of a multi-million -pound contract . Mr Coetzee said the whistleblower was involved in a smear campaign. A South African political source said last night: ‘Throughout his career Ryan  has specialised in blurring the lines between political work, civil service work and commercial work. He is now doing the same in the UK.’ Last night a Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ‘The Protector cleared Ryan of any wrongdoing in connection with the communications tender. ‘There were minor technical flaws in the way the tender was administered, but overall the tender  was valid.’","Ryan Coetzee has been given £110,000 job of rescuing Lib Dem poll ratings .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . It tells the story of vicar Adam Smallbone as he struggles to support his inner-city church with dwindling funds and ever fewer worshippers. But the sitcom Rev makes painful viewing for one fan – because it mirrors the reality he faces every day. The Rev Paul Turp is the vicar of St Leonard’s in Shoreditch, East London, which provides the backdrop for the successful cult show and is also its inspiration. Desperate times: Paul Turp (right) said his fate is uncannily similar to that of Tom Hollander's character in Rev . Just like his fictional equivalent, he is fighting to avert the threat of his parish going bankrupt and the closure of his church. Mr Turp receives a £20,000 location fee from the BBC and a £30,000 subsidy from the Church of England but this is not enough to save the Grade I-listed 18th century building which is now on the English Heritage Risk Register. The desperate state of affairs mirrors that faced by the Rev Adam Smallbone, played by Tom Hollander, in the fictional St Saviour in the Marshes. In the BBC 2 series, he is battling to save the crumbling building with a broken stained glass window, the dwindling of his congregation in an increasingly secular world and the competition from the rise of Islam. Mr Turp, the vicar of St Leonard’s since 1983, said the show is so accurate it is sometimes  hard to watch. His parish, which has a congregation of 150, needs £90,000 a year from outside the Church to stay afloat but receives nowhere near enough. Struggle: St Leonard's in Shoreditch, East London, is just one of thousands of churches struggling to stay open . The changing landscape of the East End has seen families who would have made up the bulk of its congregation move away to be replaced by younger, secular residents. There are also now 13 mosques in the borough. ‘We will do a lot of prayer and hope to pull a miraculous rabbit out of an as yet non-existent hat’, said Mr Turp, 65. ‘Last year we spent £250,000 working on the roof and the year before £180,000 on the roof and £92,000 on railings and gates. Rev shows the truth about people who love their church and understand it but do not have the resources to run it.’ Now in its third series – the final episode is on Monday night – the sitcom is written by James Wood and Hollander, who also appeared in Pirates of the Caribbean. It has 1.7million viewers and has been sold to 140 countries. After the initial series, Hollander, 46, said audiences identified with his character because he was ‘normal’ – with scenes showing him both smoking and drinking. ‘He’s a flawed and vulnerable person,’ he said. ‘I’ve met lots of vicars while making this and they’re often vulnerable.’ The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, has described the show as ‘rather really good’, saying it shows ‘the continuing commitment of the Church to run-down and challenging areas’. The Bishop of Buckingham, the Rt Rev Alan Wilson, has said: ‘At last the BBC has moved beyond the Vicar of Dibley.’","Just like fictional Adam Smallbone, Rev Paul Turp struggles to keep open .

She taught whole families from the local estate – first the parents, as well as their cousins, then their children and their children’s children. Known for her dedication and kindness, the Spanish and religious studies teacher was remembered last night in the fondest of terms by her devastated friends and pupils. Scroll down for videos .

Such was her devout nature, said one distraught pupil, she would have forgiven her attacker. Another said: ‘She was the best teacher ever, everyone loved her.’ Mrs Maguire began teaching at the Roman Catholic college in her early twenties, shortly before she married. Her husband Donald, 62, is a part-time maths teacher and landscape gardener. She lived with him in a £300,000 semi-detached home in Leeds and they have two daughters: Kerry, 32, a ballerina who retrained as an osteopath for pregnant women and babies, and Emma Jane, an acclaimed dancer with the Royal Ballet. The younger sister, who celebrated her 30th birthday on Saturday, is a soloist with the company and has starred in productions including The Nutcracker, Mayerling, and The Sleeping Beauty. She trained at the Royal Ballet School from the age of 11 –  after apparently inheriting a passion for the arts from her mother, a talented musician. While Mrs Maguire was said to have been extremely proud of her daughters’ achievements, she was known locally for treating the pupils at her school as if they were her own. As her family consoled each other over their loss, students gathered at the school to lay flowers in the teacher’s memory.

Students . said Mrs Maguire, who celebrated her birthday earlier this month, had . begun working part time in preparation for retirement in a year’s time. Jacob . Hill, 16, from Leeds, said yesterday: ‘She would never hurt anyone. She . was always trying to help people.

She was held in such immense esteem. She . taught the grandparents of some of these children here today.’ Samuel . Dasaolu, 18, who is studying accounting and finance at De Montfort . University in Leicester, was a pupil at Corpus Christi until 2011. He . said Mrs Maguire had a unique ability to calm disruptive pupils. ‘She . was almost a mother figure of the school. I felt I could go and talk to . her. She made everybody feel so comfortable,’ he said. ‘She never jumped to conclusions. I . remember there was a disagreement between a student and another student. Usually most teachers would pick a side or say, “You’re both in . detention”. Daughter: Emma Jane Maguire is an acclaimed ballerina who trained at the Royal Ballet School . 'But she listened to them and . discussed the situation. She was a teacher that was loved by everybody. You didn’t have to be a good student to love her.’ Former pupil Nathan Mulenga, 18, described Mrs Maguire as ‘the best teacher in the world’. ‘Mrs Maguire taught me Spanish for five years while I was at the school and she was such a great teacher,’ he said. ‘She . also taught religious education and she was my head of year while I was . at the school. When I left in 2012 she always said she would help me . and my friends in the future if ever we needed anything. ‘I went to college after leaving the school and she was the one who gave me a reference. ‘She cared about everyone even after they left school. It’s absolutely devastating to hear that she’s gone.’ Kerianne . Ayward, 17, who left the school two years ago, said: ‘She has been my . referee for everything. There’s no one else you would go to who’s . better. She was the heart of the school.’ You taught four generations of our family . and you were simply a totally fantastic teacher, always caring and . always there to make us smile . Another former pupil, Peter Masefield, 18, said: ‘I just can’t understand why her. Of all people. She was the school’s figurehead.’ Many students paid tribute to Mrs Maguire on social media sites, expressing their utter shock that such a kind and gentle woman had been killed at school. They said it was particularly heartbreaking that she had been targeted because she was the one teacher who ‘never wrote anybody off’. More than a hundred bunches of flowers had been left at the school gates in her memory last night. Students pinned photographs to the railings, along with teddy bears and other memorabilia. One note said: ‘You inspired countless generations. You taught four generations of our family and you were simply a totally fantastic teacher, always caring and always there to make us smile (even if you were speaking Spanish).’ Danny Powell, 17, said: ‘She was the most caring teacher at the school, she wanted the best for everyone and understood anything you had to say to her. I can’t believe what has happened.’ Michael Walpole wrote: ‘RIP Mrs Maguire. Amazing teacher, amazing family friend. You will be sorely missed.’ Abby Warwick tweeted: ‘Never known a teacher as dedicated to every one of her students as Mrs Maguire, she honestly cared so much.’ Lucy Melia said: ‘Everybody has got nothing but pure love for Mrs Maguire. Still haven’t met anyone else like her. She was the heart of that school.’ Charlene Rue added: ‘Cannot get over this. She didn’t deserve this at all. One of the nicest teachers, who would have done anything for students. RIP Mrs Maguire.’ Natalie Jade Jones, 24, who was taught by Mrs Maguire for five years before leaving the college in 2006,  said: ‘I am honoured to have been taught by her, it is a huge loss. ‘She was a wonderful woman and a fantastic teacher who will be sadly missed by everyone who knew her. Myself and all her other former pupils are in utter shock and truly devastated.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","RE and Spanish teacher Ann Maguire, 61, was due to retire next year .

"By . Associated Press . Busted: Leo Sharp was a drug courier and known as 'grandad' to the Sinaloa cartel . An 89-year-old drug mule for the notorious Sinaloa cartel known as 'old man' who hauled cocaine across the country should be spared prison because of his dementia his attorney said on Tuesday. World War II veteran Leo Sharp, is due back in Detroit federal court on his 90th birthday on May 7 for sentencing after being caught in 2011 with $3 million of drugs belonging to the Mexican cartel on Interstate 94. His attorney filed an 18-page sentencing memo, hoping to persuade a judge that home confinement would be appropriate for the Michigan City, Indiana resident. 'He is a colorful, self-made, charitable man who has worked hard throughout this entire admirable, extraordinary, and long life,' Darryl Goldberg wrote. 'Mr. Sharp made a monumental mistake at a moment of perceived financial weakness, and was exploited and threatened, but his conduct in this case was truly an aberration from a law-abiding life.' He admitted he was responsible for transporting more than 1,400 pounds of drugs that originated in Arizona. The government said it has evidence that Sharp was transporting marijuana and cocaine from the West Coast back in 2000. 'Mr. Sharp is dreadfully sorry,' Goldberg said. Scroll Down to Watch Video . Jailed: Leo Sharp is America's oldest drug mule after he was caught with 230lb of a Mexican cartel's cocaine . In preparation for the sentencing hearing, Sharp told court officials that he needed money. He said he was threatened when he tried to stop transporting drugs. Sharp was diagnosed with dementia and other health problems and would be an expensive burden on the government if sent to prison, Goldberg said. He is a World War II veteran who fought in Italy and was awarded the Bronze Star, the fourth-highest honor, for his service, Goldberg said. Sharp was arrested in October 2011 following a routine traffic stop. Leo Sharp was found guilty of transporting cocaine across America for a notorious Mexican drug cartel . When the trooper asked Sharp if he could search the truck, the octogenarian refused. So the trooper requested a backup unit with a dog trained to detect bombs and illegal drugs. As the animal walked around the rear of Sharp's truck, it alerted to the possible presence of narcotics, the complaint said. During a subsequent search of the truck bed, troopers found 104 bricks of cocaine stashed in five bags with a wholesale value of $2.9million.

"By . Dan Bloom . Its wares splayed in dazzlingly pink neat rows, this is the remote forest depot where thousands of phone booths go to die. Some 3,000 pink and yellow boxes are stored at the secluded site near Berlin - and they are being sold to the public for as little as £250 each. The sale has prompted a wave of nostalgia in Germany, where the dominance of mobile phones has rendered the booths largely useless and turned them instead into miniature libraries, personal mementos, custom-built showers and even a recording studio. Hung up: Scattered in pink rows, these are the thousands of German phone booths which have reached the end of their useful life at a remote forest depot near Berlin. Deutsche Telekom is now selling them for as little as £250 each, but there's a catch - any buyers will have to lug the 100kg monsters home all by themselves . Strangely beautiful: The one and a half acre site is hidden in the forest near the town of Michendorf, eastern Germany. Yellow booths (top) are the oldest and cost most . Vast: German photographer Ralf Hirschberger captured the incredible images of the depot for German newspapers, prompting a wave of nostalgia in the country . The one-and-a-half acre site, buried deep in the woods near the town of Michendorf, is Germany's only mass phone box graveyard of its kind. Nowadays it has few yellow boxes, which are the oldest types, and is full mainly of newer pink phone booths which have had to be discarded through lack of use by Deutsche Telekom. Although some will be stored for reuse when other booths in prominent places break, they are being sold to the public for as little as 300 Euros (£250) each. The 'vintage' yellow boxes command a higher price of 450 Euros (£370). There is a catch, however - buyers must find a way to lug the 300lb (135kg) monsters home themselves. Since the sale began the phone booths have found some quirky uses, Deutsche Telekom spokesman Georg von Wagner told Der Taggespiegel. March of the phone booths: Those sold already have been turned into greenhouses, recording studios, showers, miniature libraries, movie props and beach shelters . Deutsche Telekom employee Betina Kückels-Viehl said: 'A buyer met his wife 35 years ago against a yellow phone booth and he wanted to surprise her with a copy' 'Often, they also serve as a shelter for technical equipment or be placed in museums,' he said - but several have been bought by artists. Some people have put them in their gardens to be used as miniature greenhouses. Others have turned them into boutique shower rooms. More still have become movie props, tiny recording studios, beach shelters and even a soundproof room to make phone calls - from mobiles. It may sound surprising, but the firm said many office workers were finding their environment so distracting that it helped to have four metal and glass walls built up around them. 'Telephone . booth awaken in many people . fond memories,' said Deutsche Telekom employee Betina Kückels-Viehl - . revealing one buyer even met his wife next to one of the booths. She said: 'A prospective buyer had volunteered for example, because he . had met his wife 35 years ago against a yellow phone booth and he wanted to surprise her with a copy.' Overtaken by nature: Weighing more than 100kg each, many of the phone booths have languished at the depot for some time. Here, a tree appears to grow from one . Spot the depot: This satellite image shows the sheer scale of the site compared to the nearby town of Michendorf, just outside Berlin. Once indispensable, such booths have been in terminal decline since the dawn of mobile phones, with the number across Germany dropping from 100,000 to 40,000 in just over a decade . But the most common idea of all, Mr Wagner told Der Taggespiegel, was to turn the booths into public libraries. The sale began at the end of last year, and is likely to go on for some time as phone booths gradually vanish from public life. Once the only way for children to tell parents they were alive or for jobseekers to apply for work, the metal boxes have been in terminal decline worldwide since the dawn of mobile phones. In 2003, there were still more than 100,000 across Germany - but in many areas they have been gradually eliminated or replaced with cheaper, easier-to-run wall-mounted models. Now there are only around 40,000 left.","More than 3,000 pink and yellow booths are stored at the Deutsche Telekom site near Michendorf, eastern Germany .

"By . Helen Pow . and Meghan Keneally . George Clooney has hit back at casino billionaire Steve Wynn, who accused the actor of being 'money coddled' and living in a bubble after the pair had a heated argument. Refusing to let Wynn's 'version of the truth go unchallenged' Clooney denied he had been drinking heavily on the night in question, and repeated his claim that the billionaire had called President Obama an 'a******'. The pair reportedly had such a heated argument in in the restaurant of Wynn's Las Vegas restaurant that Clooney was seen to storm out. Falling out: George Clooney, pictured right in January with Steve Wynn and his wife Andrea, allegedly said the F-word at a recent dinner with the couple . Wynn later denied using inappropriate language to describe the president, and put their disagreement down to differing political views and tequila. But in a statement to People on Friday, Clooney said Wynn had surrounded himself with 'Yes men', and said the casino owner needed to stop making up stories. 'You can't make up stories when eight people who are not on your payroll are sitting around you as witnesses,' the actor said. He added that not only did Wynn call Obama an 'a******', 'he bellowed ""I voted for an a******"".' In an interview with Bloomberg News' Stephanie Ruhle, which was broadcast Friday, Wynn denied calling the President names. 'I didn’t call the President an a****** and George didn't call me an a******. He was a little into the tequila but he is fun to be with. He's a good storyteller,' Wynn said. 'Artists, actors, they live in a very strange bubble of their own. They’re money coddled, they’re highly privileged. Partners: 'We were not drunk' Rande Gerber, right, said of himself and Casamigos Tequila partner George Clooney, left, at the time of the altercation . 'We're talking about successful artists like George, Barbra Streisand or any other really successful performing artists. They live in a relatively small world, the people around them are very solicitous and caring of them. 'They have a worldview that is therefore- Everything should be given to everybody because everything has been given to them. If you run a business, if you are responsible for a lot of people you come to grips with the reality that you have to have discipline.' On the opposite side, Clooney's friend and longtime business partner Randy Gerber said after the bust up that the confrontation was not about politics but about loyalty. 'This wasn't about politics. It was about George standing up for a friend,' Gerber told TMZ. 'We weren't drunk... no shots were had.' In the Bloomberg interview, the 72-year-old casino magnate spoke more about his belief that it is the burden of businesspeople to prevent the government from overspending. 'If you run a business, if you are responsible for a lot of people you come to grips with the reality that you have to have discipline,' he said. On the defense: Steve Wynn said that there wasn't any explicit name calling during his argument with George Clooney but he wasn't surprised that they differed on their political opinions . 'You have to protect the enterprise in order to take care of the employees. So therefore, you can’t be wasteful, you can’t squander things or you jeopardize other people. So running a business gives you a sense of compassion that is defined in different terms than someone who just thinks of themselves as generous.' Wynn told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that Clooney likes his alcohol and 'got drunk' after drinking tequila shots. 'When he's drinking, he considers himself a close personal buddy of the president,' he said. 'Clooney's fun to be with when he's sober. If you have a chance to drink with him, you want to get there early, and don't stay late. 'Everybody who's in my business, the casino business, knows to take actors with a grain of salt.' Wynn added that Clooney's partners were 'mortified.' 'Steve Wynn and I have met three times, two times for dinner. That is the extent of our knowledge of one another, so I will refrain from trying to categorize him based on the little time we've spent together, but I will not let his version of the truth go unchallenged.'He now says he didn't call the president an ""a******"". That is false. He bellowed ""I voted for the a******', and then called him the same thing several more times as the dinner came to an abrupt end. 'Again there were eight people at the table, eight witnesses. I did in turn, call him the same body part, and walked out. Again he can make up whatever story he wants, but these are the facts. 'He said I drank 16 shots of tequila. I didn't drink one shot of tequila, not one. We were drinking but it was early and we still had two events to attend. 'He said I live in a bubble. More of a bubble than Las Vegas? Honestly? He says I'm ""molly coddled"", that I'm surrounded by people who coddle me. I would suggest that Mr Wynn look to his left and right and find anyone in his sphere that says anything but ""yes"" to him. 'Emphatically. I did not attend a private boys' school, I worked in tobacco fields and in stock rooms, and construction sites. I've been broke more of my life than I have been successful, and I understand the meaning of being an employee and how difficult it is to make ends meet. 'Steve is one of the richest men in the world and he should be congratulated for it, but he needs to take off his red sparkly dinner jacket and roll up his sleeves every once in a while and understand what most of the country is actually dealing with ... or at least start with the fact that you can't make up stories when eight people who are not on your payroll are sitting around you as witnesses.'","The alleged name-calling occurred last month when George Clooney was in Las Vegas promoting his Casamigos tequila .
