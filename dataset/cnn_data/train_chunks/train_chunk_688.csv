Footage obtained by The Mail on Sunday apparently showing Michaella McCollum Connolly taking 11kg of cocaine to her hotel was last night being examined by prosecutors. Wearing a long black skirt and with her black hair tied up, the woman in the CCTV footage is walking back from a pizza parlour carrying a large bag. The footage was recorded on CCTV on August 5 at midday – the time Michaella and Melissa Reid told police in Peru they were forced to collect the drugs. The Mail on Sunday obtained the footage from a street camera run by the city’s neighbourhood watch service. Miraflores District Neighbourhood Watch supplied two days’ worth of recordings to our reporter. We scoured it for evidence to back the women’s story. The footage we examined was taken outside the three-star hotel where the girls were staying. The Colonial San Agustin hotel is in the Miraflores district of Lima which is popular with tourists. In their police interview last week, the women said that they were called on a Blackberry phone given to them by men in Ibiza and told to go to the pizza parlour next to the hotel. Papa John’s pizza parlour is about 200 yards from the hotel on the opposite side of the street. The women said that Michaella had met a man outside the restaurant who gave her a bag and that she returned to the hotel with it. In the footage a woman is seen calmly walking past the restaurant and then the camera pans away towards the hotel. In the next shot she is seen walking quite quickly along the pavement and across a pedestrian crossing and towards the hotel. After this newspaper handed the footage to the city’s prosecutors yesterday they said it could form an important part of their case. A source said: ‘This video could prove to be hugely important in the girls’ case. ‘We will examine it carefully and try to track the movements of the figures who are keeping an eye on the girls as they load up the taxi.’ Police have already seized CCTV footage from the Colonial San Agustin hotel. Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine as they waited for a flight out of the South American country . But it appears they overlooked the video shot from the street camera outside the hotel. A police source said: ‘It’s extremely likely that is the footage of the British womanpicking up the cocaine.’ A source for Lima airport’s antinarcotics unit said the skirt worn by the woman in the video is identical to one worn by Michaella when arrested. Melissa, from Lenzie, Glasgow, claims she first met Michaella, from Northern Ireland, in one of the gangsters’ dingy hideaways in Palma, Majorca. They were kept captive in a flat, she said, then flown to Lima separately.

Jailed: Private William Demspey has been sentenced to eight years in prison for his role in the arms plot . A British soldier who acted as a Mr Fix in an arms plot to supply firearms to the Scottish underworld has been jailed for eight years. Private William Dempsey was a 'facilitator' in a £3,500 deal to sell a Uzi sub-machine gun - which can fire 600 rounds a minute - a sawn-off shotgun and other guns, crossbows and ammunition to criminals in Scotland. He used his bedroom at Howe Army Barracks in Canterbury, Kent, as a secret arsenal to store a series of weapons, a court heard. The 29-year-old was caught after displaying 'somewhat bizarre behaviour' while carrying a stash of firearms in two military camouflage bags on a Glasgow-bound train in August last year. Dempsey - who was serving with the 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland- had collected the weapons from accomplice James Ashdown. They were destined for underworld figure Barry Kelly and his 'lieutenant' Craig Colquhoun. However, the 'befuddled' soldier abandoned the train at Carlisle railway station in Cumbria after telling rail staff he was being followed by police and claiming there were snipers at the station. He then asked two cleaners to look after the bags, before running off, Liverpool Crown Court heard.

They also seized 136 cartridges for the weapons and a further 58 revolver cartridges. Officers then searched his room at his barracks, 300 miles away, and found a handgun-shaped crossbow, several metal tipped arrows and large military batteries. A further search of Dempsey's bedroom at his parents’ home in Paisley uncovered a small block of cannabis resin, while analysis of his mobile phone revealed messages about large cash payments for 'toys'. 'Befuddled': Dempsey abandoned the train at Carlisle railway station in Cumbria after telling rail staff he was being followed by police and claiming there were snipers at the station . Discovery: Police seized 136 cartridges for the weapons and a further 58 revolver cartridges . None of the weapons had come from the Ministry of Defence armoury, the court heard. Dempsey, who was arrested on a rail viaduct near Carlisle station, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition from England to Scotland. He was jailed for eight years. On the day before the seizure, Colquhoun was discovered to have paid £3,500 into Dempsey’s bank account. This led to officers arresting Kelly, Ashdown and Colquhoun - with analysis of the criminals' mobile phones cementing links between the four.

Kidnapping victim Hannah Anderson broke down in tears as she defended herself today over letters and texts she sent to her abductor in her first interview since she was rescued in the Idaho wilderness. In an interview with the Today show, she remarked on how 'cruel' people had been because of her decision to talk about the ordeal online, saying: 'In the beginning, I was a victim. But now knowing everyone out there’s helping me, I consider myself a survivor instead.' The 16-year-old also clarified some details about what her relationship with kidnapper James DiMaggio was like and why they exchanged 13 text messages on the day he abducted her after killing her mother and brother. Denying that it was phone calls they exchanged, Hannah said the 13 texts were regarding arrangements to pick her up from cheer camp, explaining where exactly she would be and the address. Scroll down for videos . Emotional: Hannah broke down in tears as she talked about her brother Ethan, saying he had a good heart . Hannah Anderson told the Today show: 'There are gonna be harder times in life but if I can get through this I can get through a lot more' Survivor: Hannah said she will tell her entire story eventually, but now is not the time to do it . According to search warrants, Anderson exchanged about 13 phone calls with DiMaggio before she was picked up from cheerleading practice that day. The San Diego County Sheriff's said it could not immediately explain the discrepancy. Authorities have also said that letters from Anderson were found at the home. Anderson said that they were written about a year ago when she was having trouble getting along with her mother and she sought advice from DiMaggio. 'Me and him would talk about how to deal with it,' she said. 'And I’d tell him how I felt about it. And he helped me through it. They weren’t anything bad. They’re just to help me through tough times.' Explaining why she chose to go on social media after her rescue and the subsequent backlash at her decision to do so, she said: 'I didn't know people could be so cruel. I connect to friends through Facebook and Instagram. 'It helps me to grieve . to post pictures and tell people how I am feeling. I'm a teenager, I'm gonna go on it. 'It's going be a little overwhelming . returning to school with people and their opinion but I know a lot of my friends will have my back. 'There are gonna be harder times in life but if I can get through this I can get through a lot more.' She broke down when talking about her brother Ethan, saying he had a 'really good heart' and said her mom was strong-hearted and very tough. 'She knew how to handle things', she said. As for the future, Hannah said she wants to be a firefighter in San Diego. Speaking out: Hannah Anderson, 16, thanked her family and friends for supporting her in the 10 days since she was freed from James DiMaggio . Victims: Hannah posted both of these photos, . dedicated to her late mother and brother, after she was taken back to . California. Police now say that Christina (left) and Ethan (right) were . tortured and killed before the fire . Post rescue appearance: Hannah Anderson attends car wash fundraiser in Lakeside to benefit her family . She said support from her friends and family has allowed her to cope with the harrowing ordeal, which saw her rescued by the FBI Hostage Rescue team in the Idaho wilderness August 10 after agents shot and killed DiMaggio, who had held her captive for a week. 'In the beginning, I was a victim but now, knowing everyone out there who is helping me, I'd consider myself a survivor, instead,' she said. She credited the Amber Alert system, which helped spread the word about her kidnapping, with saving her life. Four horseback riders who encountered her and DiMaggio in the River of No Return Wilderness called police after seeing her face on the TV news as part of an Amber Alert that extended into Idaho. Their tip led the FBI to DiMaggio. Friend say DiMaggio, 40, had a 'crush' on Hannah and once told her that he would date her if he were a teenager. Investigators . still don't know what drove him to murder Hannah's family and abduct . her - taking her on a 1,000 mile road trip that ended August 10. Police say DiMaggio, one of Christina Anderson's closest friends, invited Christina, Hannah and Ethan to stay at his house in Boulevard, California, on August 3. He told them that he was leaving town and moving to Texas. That night, he killed Christina and Ethan. Autopsy results show Christina was tortured and then bashed in the head. He also shot their family dog, Cali. He then rigged his house with arson wire and set it to burn down 20 hours after he left. Border patrol cameras spotted DiMaggio and Hannah in his blue Nissan Versa car about 12.10am August 4. Police weren't called to his house until later that night when it caught fire. Kidnapped: James Lee DiMaggio, left, was known as 'Uncle Jim' to Hannah Anderson and her brother Ethan. Police say he murdered Ethan and Hannah's mother before kidnapping Hannah . For six days, police hunted for DiMaggio and Hannah. Authorities issued and Amber Alert for California almost immediately and informed border patrol agents at the Mexican border. Later, the alert was extended to Washington and Oregon after drivers reported seeing DiMaggio's Versa heading north toward the Canadian border. The . family of James DiMaggio, who kidnapped Hannah Anderson after killing . her mother and brother, are asking for a DNA test because they believe . he is her biological father. A . spokesman for James DiMaggio's family made the request after it was . revealed he left $112,000 to Hannah's grandmother, who he named as the . sole beneficiary of his life insurance policy. DiMaggio, who was like an uncle to the . Anderson children and their father's best friend, died in a shootout . with FBI agents on August 10 in the Idaho wilderness six days after he set fire to his home. Hannah . was rescued and returned to Southern California. Her eight-year-old . brother Ethan and mother Christina died from blunt force trauma. Andrew Spanswick told 10News.com: 'He expected the grandmother to take care of the two children with the . money. He stated he did not want it to go to their parents because they . were having marital problems and he didn't trust them with the money on . their own. 'We are requesting DNA samples from . Hannah and anything they can get from Ethan. There are rumors Jim was . the children's real father. 'The parents didn't marry until 2002. We think it's strange he left them so much money with no explanation.' He also described Hannah's behavior as suspicious saying: 'Some things that Hannah is saying on her Facebook doesn't add up so far; her latest posts are disturbing.' It is unclear what these Facebook posts are. Stacy Hess, a spokesperson for Brett Anderson, said in a statement: 'Brett and Tina Anderson did not meet Mr DiMaggio until the sixth month of Tina’s pregnancy with Hannah. 'Brett Anderson’s DNA was used to identify the body of his dead son Ethan Anderson.' And David Braun, Tina Anderson's uncle, reacted angrily to the idea. 'I would tell them to shut up with their accusations and their implications up until after the funeral, until after my precious Tina and precious Ethan are buried -- the family members that your family murdered,' Braun said. When four horseback riders came across the . 16-year-old in the Idaho wilderness with DiMaggio they said she did not . seem to be under duress. She later claimed it was all an act as she did not want to endanger them. They later tipped off police, leading to the rescue of the teen and the shooting death of DiMaggio. Search warrants unsealed last week said Hannah was picked up from a cheerleading practice at 4pm on August 4, but Caldwell said the practice was a day earlier. Firefighters found the body of Christina Anderson, 44, when they extinguished flames at DiMaggio's home in Boulevard, a tiny town about 65 miles east of San Diego on the U.S.-Mexico border. A spokeswoman for the family said: 'Brett Anderson’s DNA was used to identify the body of his dead son Ethan Anderson' What remained: Firefighters found the bodies of . Christina and Ethan Anderson covered with tarp, showing that they were . killed before the fire that burnt down Jim DiMaggio's Boulevard cabin . (pictured) A search warrant says she was found near a crowbar and what appeared to be blood next to her head. The San Diego County Medical . Examiner's Office said she died of a blunt head injury, without . elaborating on the nature of the wound or the circumstances of her death . in a posting to its website. The manner of death is listed as homicide. Investigators found eight-year-old Ethan Anderson's body as they sifted through rubble. Authorities identified his remains several days later by extracting DNA from his bone marrow. The medical examiner's office said on Tuesday the cause and manner of the boy's death remained under investigation. Hannah Anderson says she didn't learn her mother and brother died until after she was rescued. She said on a social media site last week that she was 'on the road to Idaho' when the fire ignited. 'He had set to wear (sic) it would catch on fire at a certain time,' she wrote. A memorial service is scheduled Saturday for the mother and son in Santee, an east San Diego suburb.

Dispute: Saad al-Hilli was gunned down in the Alps last year, and now it has been claimed he was arguing with an unidentified man the night before . A British man gunned down in the Alps alongside his family last year was seen in a 'heated' argument at his camp site the previous night, according to a new report. Saad al-Hilli, a 50-year-old engineer, was shot dead in his parked car along with his wife, Ikbal, and mother-in-law near the French town of Annecy, close to the Swiss border. Sylvain Mollier, a French cyclist, was also killed in the attack, though al-Hilli's two daughters Zeena, four, and Zainab, seven, survived. The identity of the murderer remains a mystery. Several campers saw al-Hilli speaking with a man at Le Solitaire du Lac campsite. It is unclear what the men discussed, but sources speaking to Le Parisien newspaper said the exchange was 'heated, but it was not described as vehement.' The source, thought to be close to the case, sounded a a further note of caution by adding that 'everyone has his own interpretation as to what constitutes a dispute according to his own culture', according to the Daily Telegraph. The French report provided more background to the incident, saying that the al-Hilli family arrived in the area four days before they were attacked on 5 September 2012. At first they had stayed in another campsite, but they did not like the plot they were given and moved to Le Solitaire du Lac, where they spent their final night. French investigators have reportedly been looking in to who might have known the location of the campsite where they were staying, around eight miles from the site of their murder. The mystery surrounding the case intensified recently when prosecutors admitted they had not been able to find the British passports belonging to Mr al-Hilli and his wife. Eric Maillaud, a prosecutor in charge of the case, told Le Parisien: 'Investigators . searched absolutely everywhere, on the bodies, in the family caravan, . in the house in Claygate [in Britain]. Unknown visitor: Mr al-Hilli was seen speaking with an unidentified man at Le Solitaire du Lac campsite, pictured . Mystery: The scene of the killing in the Alps last year, which was believed to target the al-Hilli family . Road: Mr Mollier and the al-Hillis were killed by an unknown assassin near Lake Annecy . Investigation: Police outside Mr al-Hilli's home in Surrey hunting for clues into his death . 'Given the timing, it’s not impossible that the killer took the two . passports... but that would have been tight.' On Monday a BBC Panorama documentary was broadcast in which Mr al-Hilli's brother Zaid admitted that the two almost came to blows in an argument over how to split their father's £1million estate when he died. Zaid, a 54-year-old accountant, never spoke to his brother again after the dispute, but denied hiring a hitman to kill him, despite a torrent of speculation. Denial: Zaid al-Hilli said he had nothing to do with the murder, though he admitted arguing with his brother the last time he saw him . He was arrested by French police - the only person held in connection with the murder - but has been released on bail. He said: ‘He pinned me down. I was on the bed in my bedroom and he pinned me down. That’s it. That’s all.' Up to 100 officers in Britain and France . have been focusing on several lines of inquiry linked to the family’s . complex background – they moved from Baghdad to Britain in 1971 – but . the main theory remains that a dispute over the huge inheritance is . behind the bloodbath. Zaid also alleged that police have failed to . properly investigate the possibility that the real target was Sylvain . Mollier, a cyclist who was also shot dead during the attack on his . brother. He said: ‘They are covering up for someone in France in that region and they know it. There is something more to it locally.’ He has refused to go to France in order to be questioned by French police. French investigators believe Mr Mollier, 45, was killed because he stumbled upon the murder scene. The BBC programme also spoke to two witnesses, who saw a motorbike and a BMW 4x4 close to the murder scene. The motorcyclist was said to be the likely killer, and French authorities have since announced they will release an e-fit image of the man.

It was recovered yesterday after 70 years lying on the bottom of the English Channel, but the German Dornier 17 rescued from its watery grave was originally shot down at the height of the Battle of Britain. The aircraft, which historians believe is the only remaining example of the 'flying pencil', was raised from the sea bed in the biggest salvage operation of its kind in British waters. But the bomber was originally part of a large enemy formation which was intercepted by RAF fighter aircraft on August 26, 1940, as they attempted to attack airfields in Essex. Scroll down for video . The German Dornier 17 was raised from the sea bed yesterday in the biggest salvage operation of its kind in British waters . The plane was shot down after it was attacked by RAF fighter aircraft at the height of the Battle of Britain . The plane was forced to make a belly-up emergency landing on the Goodwin Sands, in Kent, after it was damaged in the firefight . In action: A Dornier bomber similar to the one which crashed into the sea during the Battle of Britain . The plane was forced to make a . belly-up emergency landing on the Goodwin Sands, in Kent, at low tide . following a firefight in the skies above which left crew wounded and . both engines damaged. Attempting a wheels-up landing, Feldwebel (Flt Sgt) Willi Effmert managed to touch down safely and the aircraft sank inverted. While Effmert and his observer were captured the other crewmen died and their bodies were later washed ashore. A . notable aspect of the battle was the enormous bravery of the RAF Boulton Paul . Defiant fighter pilots, who took on the Dornier 17 in outdated planes . which had already suffered many losses in the early stages of the Battle . of Britain. The two-seater planes, which had space for a rear gunner, were considered obsolete by the time the Battle of Britain was in full swing and the type was eventually withdrawn from front-line fighter duties to be converted to a night fighter role and later a drone tug. The Do 17 was one of the principal bombers used by the Luftwaffe in the early years of the war, including during the Blitz. It was part of a combined formation of Dorniers sent to bomb Debden and Hornchurch airfields before the battle in August 1940. Rising . leviathan: The Dornier 17 aircraft is lifted from waters of the English . Channel. It was shot down during the 'Battle of Britain' in 1940 by RAF . Boulton-Paul Defiant fighters. Two of its four-man Luftwaffe crew were . killed as it crashed into the sea, but the other two were captured by . the British and became prisoners of war . Artefact: . The team watches as the aircraft is painstakingly lifted out of the . sea. Aviation enthusiasts are excited because the bomber is in . 'remarkable condition' Success: . Earlier attempts to raise the craft from the sea bed were thwarted by . high winds but the project finally came to fruition today. Some parts of . the aircraft fell into the seas as it was being raised, but the RAF . Museum tweeted that these parts will be recovered by divers. The wings . and engines are intact, amazingly . Recovery: . Workers secure the remains of the crashed Dornier , the only surviving . one of its type. It is known as the 'pencil bomber' because of its . extremely thin fuselage . The Dornier 17 is believed to have been brought down by an RAF Boulton Paul Defiant (pictured) It is believed seven aircraft started to bomb an aerodrome, thought to be Debden, causing some damage. However, accounts of the aircraft's loss vary between sources. Since the recovery yesterday, the wings and the fuselage of the aircraft have been sympathetically detached as the aircraft lies on the barge which is waiting to come into Ramsgate Harbour today. Once the plane lands in the harbour it will be wrapped in a 'gel-like' substance to prevent further oxidisation and will then be placed upon three wide-load lorries to be taken up to Cosford this afternoon. Paul Hudson, head of marketing at the RAF Museum London, said once at Cosford, the aircraft will be placed into hydration tunnels and it will be sprayed with a light citric solution to gently wash the aircraft of the salts that have accumulated over the last 70 years. He said: 'During this process, the aircraft will be on view to the public and that should happen this weekend. 'It will undergo this process for three to five years at Cosford after which we will probably spend another year to a year-and-a-half prepping the aircraft to ensure it doesn't suffer any further corrosion and the intention is that it will eventually go on display at our London site opposite the wrecked Hawker Hurricane that we have here that was recovered from the Battle of Britain.' According to the original PoW Interrogation Report, the Do 17 became separated from the rest of the formation while flying above clouds before reaching its target. It was then attacked by fighters, believed to be one of the recently arrived RAF Hornchurch, Essex-based Boulton Paul Defiants of No.264 Squadron RAF led by Flt Lt Banham. The attack is thought to have hit both engines and the cockpit. Reports suggest the Defiants brought down between one and six Dorniers in the fight, while losing three of their number. Of the four crew of the Do 17, two became Prisoners-of-War in Canada - wounded Pilot Feldwebel Willi Effmert and Bomb Aimer Uffz Hermann Ritzel - and two were killed - 27-year old Wireless Operator Unteroffizier Helmut Reinhardt and 21-year old Bomb aimer Gefreiter Heinz Huhn. Their bodies were recovered later and buried in Holland and the UK, in the Cannock Chase German cemetery, respectively. The recovery of the aircraft from the . seabed is a £600,000 project by the RAF Museum in North London. Its . team were able to raise the aircraft  by placing metal cables around the . strongest part of the frame and lifting it whole. Experts at the museum say the plane, found on Goodwin Sands by divers in 2008, . is in 'remarkable condition', particularly considering the events . surrounding its downfall and the effects of spending so much time under . water. Peter Dye, of the RAF Museum, said: ‘The . discovery and recovery of the Dornier is of national and international . importance. The aircraft is a unique and unprecedented survivor from the . Battle of Britain and the Blitz.. 'It will provide an evocative and . moving exhibit that will allow the museum to present the wider story of . the Battle of Britain and highlight the sacrifices made by the young men . of both air forces. It is a project that has reconciliation and . remembrance at its heart.' Apart . from being covered with barnacles and teeming with marine life, the . Dornier is largely intact. The undercarriage tyres remain inflated . although the propellers were damaged when the aircraft crashed. Sonar scans by the RAF Museum, Wessex Archaeology and the Port of London Authority confirmed its identity. The recovery was backed by a National Heritage Memorial Fund grant of £345,000. A . two-year restoration will take place at the RAF Museum’s site in . Cosford, Shropshire, and it will later go on display at the RAF Museum . in Hendon, North London. The . plane will eventually be restored and go on display as an 'evocative . and moving' reminder of the young men of both sides who lost their lives . in the battle for air supremacy in 1940.

A Harvard film scholar has revealed in terrifying detail how Hollywood was at the whim of the Nazis throughout the 1930s - censoring films and dropping others in a sinister collaboration with Hitler. In one particularly extreme case, one non-Jewish MGM executive divorced his Jewish wife at the demand of Germany's Propaganda Ministry - and she ended up in a concentration camp. In his new book, Ben Urwand has revealed how studios including MGM, Paramount and 20th Century Fox failed to stand up to Hitler and painted his regime as heroic and desirable. 'I want to bring out a hidden episode in . Hollywood history and an episode that has not been reported . accurately,' the Harvard scholar said. 'Collaboration': Hitler's Nazi leaders were in cahoots with Hollywood movie studios to make sure films painted them in a positive light, a Harvard historian has claimed . Although other film historians dispite it, Urwand said studio chiefs were happy to . work with Nazi censors to change or cancel productions so that they . could keep access to the German film market. From . 1932, Nazi laws meant studios could have their licenses revoked if they . produced films, shown in Germany or abroad, that were considered . offensive to Germans. Urwand believes that . filmmakers not only wanted to continue working during the build up to . the war, they also thought Hitler may win the war and wanted to . safeguard the future of their businesses. In his book, The Collaboration: Hollywood's Pact with Hitler, which has been excerpted in the Hollywood Reporter, in Urwand said that Hollywood was happy to bow to Hitler's demands. For example, when All Quiet on the Western . Front was released in December 1930, Joseph Goebbels told protesters to set off stink . bombs and release mice in the movie theaters. It caused such disruptions throughout theaters that the films were stopped and it was eventually banned from the country, due to how Germans felt they had been depicted. Orders: All Quiet on the Western Front was heavily edited after German theaters banned it for its negative portrayal of the country, while It Can't Happen Here was dropped from cinemas entirely . Protest: Goebbels ordered Germans to disrupt screenings of the film All Quiet on the Western Front, above . Carl Laemmle, the Jewish German-American head of Universal Pictures, was so bothered that he edited a version that would not upset the Germans. He traveled to Germany to present the film and . was told that they would only put on the film if the edits were made to . the movie before it showed in all other countries. He agreed. The 1936 MGM movie It Can't Happen Here, which showed democracy winning over fascism, was also dropped. The . film, based on Nobel laureate Sinclair Lewis's novel, was banned over . 'fear of international politics' and the potential of boycotts abroad. Also putting on the pressure was a diplomat named Georg Gyssling, who became the German consul in Los Angeles in 1933 and threatened the studios with an article in Germany's film regulations. It stated that all of a company's movies would be banned from Germany if it was found distributing anti-German films anywhere in the world. Movie critic: Historian Ben Urwand has . researched the reach of Nazi influence on Hollywood before the war and . believes that many of the studios bowed to business pressures from . Germany . The rule meant that some movies were canceled altogether - both once they had finished production and before they even got there. In one startling example of the reach of the Nazis within Hollywood, a film about the treatment of Jews in Germany that was created by Herman J. Mankiewicz - who would later write Citizen Kane - and producer Sam Jaffe never went ahead. Despite the determination of the two movie makers, every studio turned them down on the belief that Germany would ban all U.S. films if it were made. When it was handed over to a well-known agent, Al Rosen, he also struggled to get executives to give money to the project. In the mid-1930s, relationships between studios and prominent Nazis grew and Paramount hired a manager for its German branch, Paul Thiefes, who was a member of the Nazi party. It was at the time that the head of MGM in Germany, Frits Strengholt, divorced his Jewish wife at the request of the Propaganda Ministry. War years: MGM is one of the studios Urwand says collaborated with Nazi Germany . They paid attention to workers too; German composers dubbed music originally created by Jewish musicians, while names were slashed from credits if they had dealt with anti-Nazi films in the past. The historian also found a letter from . January 1938 in which a 20th Century Fox worker was asking Hitler about . his views on films. The letter was signed 'Heil Hitler'. This collaboration between Hollywood and the Nazis lasted well into 1940 but as the war continued, the studios found it nearly impossible to distribute their pictures in England and France. And in turn they were less concerned with the relatively minor German market. MGM, Paramount and . 20th-Century Fox did not leave Germany until mid-1940. But even . after Hollywood started making anti-Nazi films, it . continued to erase references to the Jews because studio chiefs, . including Jewish refugees, wanted to 'avoid special pleading on their . behalf'. Urwand said studio . bosses could not claim ignorance of the atrocities being carried out . against the Jews because they had been forced to fire Jewish employees. Censor: Propaganda minister Goebbels talks to the Hitler Youth in Berlin in 1935 . Screen test: Hitler was not amused at Charlie Chaplin's performance in The Great Dictator . Hitler was said to have . enjoyed films such as Mutiny on the Bounty and The Lives of a Bengal . Lancer. He also liked Mr Smith Goes to Washington, because it showed . democracy in a poor light. And . while he is said to have liked Laurel and Hardy, Hitler was not keen on . Charlie Chaplin's portray of him in The Great Dictator, according to . the Guardian. However, . rival historian Tom Doherty claims that U.S. commerce department files . show that rather than working with the Nazis, MGM had been advised to . invest in armaments to get around currency being blocked. 'I don't see sinister, greedy . monsters.

The great grandson of Ernest Hemingway has run with the bulls in Pamplona exactly ninety years after the author visited the festival for the first time. Michael Hemingway took pictures of the famous run. Ernest Hemingway made the festival so famous it now attracts around one million visitors. Dressed in white with a red neckerchief Hemingway junior joined several thousand other thrill seekers as they sprinted through the narrow cobbled streets of Pamplona chased by six half-tonne Iberian fighting bulls and six steers.

Time for a drink: Michael (left) and John (right) Hemingway. The event became world famous following the 1926 publication of Ernest Hemingway's novel 'The Sun Also Rises' In 1923 Hemingway made his first visit to San Fermin to cover the nine-day festival for Canada's Toronto Star, a visit he used as the basis for his novel 'Fiesta: The Sun Also Rises'. The fiesta in northern Spain is now one of the biggest street parties in the world and each year the population swells from just under 200,000 to more than a million as people travel from all over the world to experience it. Since Hemingway's visit there are some notable changes, back then women were not allowed to take part in the morning runs, when the bulls charge from one end of the old quarter to the other to be killed that evening in the bullring. Topical: The Sun Also Rises is a 1926 novel written by American author Ernest Hemingway about a group of American and British expatriates who travel from Paris to the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona to watch the running of the bulls and the bullfights . The event demands nerves of steel, quick relfexes and the ability to run like the wind. During Spain's infamous running of the bulls, thousands of daredevils race through the streets of Pamplona - with a herd of bulls hot on their heels. Runners - or 'mozos' - raced through the streets of the northern Spanish city of Pamplona today in a hair-raising but relatively clean second bull run of the famed annual San Fermin festival. Run! The festival is a symbol of Spanish culture that attracts thousands of tourists to watch the bull runs despite heavy condemnation from animal rights groups . Snap-happy: Michael Hemingway, 16, snaps a few more pics of the event which is televised nationally and is the highlight of the nine-day street partying festival . Look out! The annual Fiesta de San Fermin was made famous by the 1926 novel 'The Sun Also Rises' by Ernest Hemmingway . The daredevils - quickly followed by the bulls - run through the historic heart of Pamplona for nine days as part of the adrenalin-fuelled fiesta . There were no gorings in the run and four people were treated in city hospitals for injuries suffered in falls, Navarra Hospital chief Javier Sesma said. The early morning race saw thrill-seekers dashing alongside six fighting bulls and six bell-tinkling steers that try to keep the creatures together along the narrow 930-yard (850-meter) course from a holding pen to the city bull ring. Today's run lasted just over two minutes. The run is televised nationally and is the highlight of the nine-day street partying festival, which became world famous following the 1926 publication of Ernest Hemingway's novel 'The Sun Also Rises.' 'Never again,' said Jonathan . Chadwick, 31, an engineer from Auckland, New Zealand, who said it was . his 'first and last time' to run. Father and son: Michael Hemingway, 16, left walks beside his father, John, 53. Ernest Hemingway never actually took part in the running of the bull because he had shrapnel left over from the war and it made running difficult . Rex Ryan also  spent part of his summer vacation running from angry bulls. The New York Jets coach came to the event too. The team confirmed Monday that Ryan was uninjured while participating both days in the run. Ben Patton, a contestant on NBC's matchmaker show ""Ready for Love,"" tweeted an Instagram photo of himself and some friends posing with Ryan in Pamplona. Well, it's something to do!

The bulls that are run each morning are invariably killed in evening bull fights . The heart-stopping run and subsequent parties were originally organised in honor of San Fermin, patron saint of Navarra . The origin of the controversial fiesta stems from the need to move the bulls from the off-site corrals to the bullring where they would be killed in the evening. Foolish youngsters would dash in amongst the creatures to prove their bravery. In Pamplona the festival is run to honour San Fermin, the city's saint, and runs between July 6 and 14. Runners wear red and white, ask San Fermin for protection, and hold rolled up newspapers in case they need to distract the bulls. They run from the corrals, through the streets, before finally ending in the bull ring. Each year hundreds of people are injured, and occasionally killed, in the fiesta. Three Spaniards and a 41-year-old man from Pheonix, Arizona, were injured but none were in a serious condition, according to the Navarra regional government press office. The bulls that are run each morning are invariably killed in evening bull fights, and their meat is served up in Pamplona's restaurants. Animals rights groups have previously slammed the event, branding it cruel to the bulls forced to run. A PETA spokesman slammed the event, and called for a boycott of the annual festival.They said: 'In this day and age, it's appalling that sensitive animals are still being tormented and killed in front of a screaming crowd. 'PETA and Spanish group AnimaNaturalis are joining compassionate people from around the world in condemning this cruel blood sport – and in urging tourists to stay far away from the bullfights.' The heart-stopping run and subsequent parties were originally organised in honor of San Fermin, patron saint of Navarra, although the religious aspect has now faded.

When they finish they shout 'Viva San Fermin!, Gora San Fermin,' the official website said. This chant is sung three times before 8am, until the gates are opened and the bulls released. After the launching of two rockets, the bulls charge behind the runners for 825 metres, the distance between the corral and the bullring.

Although Pamplona is arguably the most famous of places for the running of the bulls, the tradition is carried out around Spain.

Many jump into the sea during the traditional ''Bous a la Mar' festival in the eastern Spanish coastal town of Denia, near Alicante. Boats could be seen sailing up to the bulls to help guide them to shore afterwards. During this festival, revellers emerging from protective barriers provoke bulls to chase them until they both fall into sea. The bulls are then rescued by small boats which will tow them to safety.

A toddler whose mother was struggling to kick a heroin habit died after drinking methadone from a child's beaker that was left on a set of drawers in his parents’ home, a court heard today. Riley Pettipierre, two, of Belper, Derbyshire, died in hospital last March after drinking the drug from a beaker left in the room of his mother Sally Dent and father Shaun Binfield, where he also slept. Dent and Binfield are now on trial, charged with their son's manslaughter and cruelty to a person under 16 as it is alleged they failed to keep methadone and other drugs out of the reach of the child. Tragic: Riley Pettipierre, two, of Belper, Derbyshire, died in hospital last March after drinking methadone from a child's beaker that was left on a set of drawers in his parents' home, Nottingham Crown Court heard . Opening her prosecution case, Yvonne Coen QC told a jury at Nottingham Crown Court that Dent, who repeatedly dabbed her eyes with a tissue in the dock, was struggling to get over a heroin habit. Dent has a history of drug use going back many years and is being prescribed methadone to try to rid her of the habit, Ms Coen told the court. A child's beaker with methadone was left on a set of drawers in his parents’ bedroom where he also slept, so it would be ‘within easy reach’ of his mother, Ms Coen alleged. Dent awoke to find Riley unconscious in bed next to her and called 999 on March 13 last year. She described her son to police as ‘a gorgeous little boy’ and a ‘loveable rogue who got up to the usual mischief’, the court heard. Parents: Shaun Binfield (left) and Sally Dent (right) outside Nottingham Crown Court, where the pair denied the manslaughter of two-year-old Riley Pettipierre and cruelty to a person under the age of 16 . ‘Not only would (the beaker) have attracted him to it like a little bee to a honeypot but it was also within easy reach of him,’ she said. It was ‘grave negligence’ by his parents to leave the dangerous drug in a beaker, which the toddler would have thought was juice, the prosecutor told the court. Paramedics arrived to find Riley lifeless. His heart had stopped beating and his lips were blue, Ms Coen told the court. The toddler was taken to hospital but pronounced dead shortly after arriving. Friends and family of the couple wept in the dock as Ms Coen told the jury that post-mortem tests showed that Riley had enough methadone in his blood, stomach and urine to prove fatal. Sadness: Mourners leave flowers outside a disused shop below the flat where Riley Pettipierre died last March . He is believed to have consumed between 10ml and 20ml of methadone, the court heard. The couple originally told officers that Riley must have climbed on top of a wardrobe in the bedroom where the methadone was usually stored in a locked wooden box, Ms Coen told the court. She claims that Binfield, who was watching television in the other room on the morning of the incident, let Riley go back into the bedroom unsupervised, knowing that methadone was within his reach and knowing that Dent was sleeping off drugs she had taken the night before. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow and the pair - who both deny all the charges - remain on bail.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 23:44 EST, 2 July 2011 . Iran has been funnelling weapons to America's enemies in Iraq and Afghanistan to weaken Western influence in the region, reports the Wall Street Journal. The paper quotes senior U.S. officials, who say Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has been sending weapons to militia allies in Iraq and Afghanistan in recent months. The Revolutionary Guard has smuggled rocket-assisted exploding projectiles to Iraq, officials told the paper, and these weapons have resulted in the deaths of American troops. Arms for enemies? Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards test missiles in 2006. U.S. officials accuse the group of arming insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan . Iranians have also reportedly sent long-range rockets to the Taliban in Afghanistan, who continue to battle U.S. and coalition forces. According to the Wall Street Journal, Iran's arms shipments 'escalate the shadow competition for influence playing out between Tehran and Washington across the Middle East and North Africa'. The U.S. has been preparing to draw down troops from Afghanistan after nearly a decade of conflict in the country, but hopes to leave stable, pro-Western governments there and in Iraq. Maj. Gen. James Buchanan, the U.S. military's top spokesman in Iraq, told the Wall Street Journal: 'I think we are likely to see these Iranian-backed groups continue to maintain high attack levels' as the exit date nears. 'But they are not going to deter us from doing everything we can to help the Iraqi security forces', he said. In June, 15 U.S. servicemen were killed in Iraq, the most in more than two years. Members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards chant anti-U.S and anti-Israel slogans at the Tehran University campus in 2001 . The U.S. has attributed all the attacks to Shiite militias it says are trained by the Revolutionary Guards, rather than traditional foes al Qaeda. Officials are worried that Iran's stepped-up aggression in the Middle East may lead to more clashes with Tehran, especially as there have recently been a few near misses with Iranian forces. Just a few years ago, hawks within the U.S. government were calling for an invasion of Iran, so it's not inconceivable that tensions could mount again. Controversial: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of Iran, speaks in 2006. Tehran is stepping up tensions with the West . Officials have said the Taliban's ability to hit targets has roughly doubled, thanks to rockets that appear to have been supplied by the Revolutionary Guard's overseas unit, the Qods Force. The hostility also comes amid reports of tension within Iran between controversial President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Many of the outspoken president's closest aides have been detained on alleged corruption charges in recent weeks. In recent months, according to U.S. officials, Iran has stepped up intelligence and propaganda activities in Egypt, Bahrain and Yemen, where pro-U.S. leaders have either fallen or come under intense pressure. Tehran has also reportedly sent advisers to Syria to help President Bashar al-Assad. Iranian officials have denied that the Revolutionary Guard armed militants in Iraq and Afghanistan. They claim U.S.officials made up these stories to justify their own military presence in the area. Heavy metal: Iran's Revolutionary Guards are heavily armed, as seen in this file photo from 2006 . Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said: 'This is the propaganda of the Americans. They are worried because they have to leave Iraq very soon, according to the plan. 'They are better off going home and sorting out their own domestic problems'. Iranian officials have also accused the U.S. and Israel of interfering in their country, including assassinating Iranian nuclear scientists and supporting opposition groups. The U.S. and Israel have denied this. Ayatollah Khamenei told Afghan President Hamid Karzai last week: 'Americans want to have permanent bases in Afghanistan, and this is dangerous because the real security will not be established as long as the American military forces are present'. U.S. officials say the Qods Force is training and arming three militias that have attacked U.S. and Iraqi forces. Iranian Revolutionary Guards man their speedboats in the Persian Gulf off the port of Bandar Abbas, during war games dubbed 'Tariq al-Qods' (Way to Jerusalem) These include Kata'ib Hezbollah, or Brigades of the Party of God, and the Promise Day Brigade and Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, the latter of which are offshoots of the Mahdi Army headed by the anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who lives in Iran. Kata'ib Hezbollah has recently stepped up attacks on U.S. troops with IRAMs, or improvised rocket-assisted munitions. These are often propane tanks packed with explosives and launched from the backs of flatbed trucks with rockets. Kata'ib Hezbollah claimed credit for a June 6 IRAM attack that killed six American troops at Camp Victory, near Baghdad, while three Americans were killed this week when an IRAM struck a base near the Iranian border. Gen. Buchanan said: 'They want to claim credit for making us leave Iraq'.","U.S. officials: Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps supporting insurgents .

After typing in her message to her friend of 50 years, 77-year-old Mrs Levy was turned down and warned by the Marks & Spencer website against using bad language. Horrified, the tech-savvy grandmother closely checked the e-card for typing slip-ups, but still could not get approval for: ‘Many happy returns on your significant birthday.’ But after complaining to the store, she was told her card had been banned simply because her friend’s name was Dick – the shortened version of Richard. Mrs Levy, from Turnham Green, West London, said yesterday yesterday said she was ‘completely surprised’ by Mark and Spencer’s ban. ‘When it came up with, “Your message cannot contain profanity”, I didn’t get it. I’m obviously too innocent. I thought it must be the word “significant” that it thought was dodgy, but it still would not accept it. I tried various ways, taking out bits of text, but it still said no. ‘After I wrote to M&S to ask what I had done wrong, I could not believe it when they sent me a prissy letter saying it was because my friend is called Dick. ‘It is political correctness gone absolutely mad.’ Marks & Spencer told her in the letter that the card had been banned ‘to avoid the system being used to harass by containing profanity’. It added: ‘Sadly the word showing as profanity in your card is Richard’s name.’ The firm’s only suggestion was that Mrs Levy called her friend Richard. Instead, Mrs Levy sent Dick - a friend of more than fifty years - a card by post. Mrs Levy regularly sends e-cards because of their convenience. She said: ‘I send e-cards because it is a nice and easy way of doing things. I usually use an American site, but none of their cards were sober enough to send to a 90-year-old. They were all far too brash and lively. ‘I picked an innocuous card on the M&S website. It’s the first time I have used them. I shan’t again. I don’t mind them weeding out profanities – I’m glad for my grandsons to be shielded from the horrors of the internet – but it should not be beyond the wit of man to have a system that knows Dick is a name.’ Mrs Levy, a former interior designer, who has been using the internet at home since 1995, and browses using her computer, iPad and smartphone added: ‘It is amazing how fast things have changed and advanced, but obviously too fast for M&S.’ A Marks & Spencer spokesman said: ‘We must ensure out system is robust to protect our content standards.’ Rules: M&S also said: 'We understand that the customer did not intend to cause offence'","Tech-savvy Ruth Levy, 77, who also owns an iPad, often shops online .

It has been nearly three hundred years since French King Louis XIV died in his beloved Palace of Versailles. But the job of hunting the underground rodents that irritated the monarch as they destroyed his luxurious palace gardens still exists today. Jerome Dormion is the latest in a long line of molecatchers employed to keep the royal palace and gardens rodent-free. Serious work: Molecatcher Jerome Dormion, 36, pictured in front of the Palace of Versailles where he is the latest in a long line of molecatchers . Taking no prisoners: Dormion displays a number of previously-caught frozen moles. He once spent three months chasing one mole . Elegant: The huge 800 hectares (2,000 acres) grounds of the Palace of Versailles have long been plagued by moles creating molehill son the manicured grass . The 36-year-old uses archaic metal traps that kill moles when their two prongs contract and snap the animals' necks. But while the role might sound like something of a gimmick, Mr Dormion insists that his position is 'serious work'. The enthusiast signs his text messages off with the line 'Molecatcher to the King' and says his job is to ensure 'molehills don't deface Europe's finest gardens'. The former gardener added: 'We still have visiting dignitaries too. Imagine if they were to see them.' Mr Dormion is responsible for keeping the around 800 hectares (2,000 acres) of magnificent horticulture mole-free on the grounds, which include Marie Antoinette's cherished farm and famed gardener Andre Le Notre's Royal Path and Grand Canal. While . Dormion approaches his constant hunt for the burrowing rodents with . vigour, he also adds a touch of humour when talking about his role. Archaic: Dormion uses an age-old technique to catch the moles - a metal trap that smashes together when the mole passes, trapping the animal . Terminator: Dormion displays a mole caught in a trap. The rodents cause molehills when they burrow, angering groundskeepers at the palace . He said: 'I'm known as the king's molecatcher . because Versailles is still the palace. The king might be . gone, but the palace still has moles, loads of them. Which . is good, as it keeps me in work.' Dormion recalls one of his proudest moments as the capture of a ole he had been chasing for months. He said: 'Moles are exceptionally clever. That's why the majority of gardeners can't catch them. One of the . wiliest I have ever encountered outsmarted my traps for three months... Eventually, it got lazy and I got it.' Dormion also highlights how versatile . the mole is. On a scorching summer day, he once stood aghast at a . strange sight in one of the royal fountains: a mole swimming around the . basin. 'In my job,' says Dormion, 'I never fail to be surprised.' Molecatcher to the king: Dormion is the latest in a 330-year line of molecatchers employed on the palace grounds . King of the hill: A recently caught dead mole hangs from a bucket. King Louis XIV first hired a molecatcher in the late 1600s . The royal molecatcher was first hired by . Louis XIV, the Bourbon king who moved the court to Versailles, in the . late 1600s. Historians say that the monarch lavished so much . money on the upkeep of his beloved residence that it plunged the entire . country into debt. Large mounds of earth mark out the routes travelled by the moles - solitary underground rodents with giant paws for digging. As the palace lies around 7.5 miles . outside Paris' city walls in the countryside, moles have long been able . to burrow through the gardens, much to many groundskeepers' annoyance. Dormion describes his trapping technique as resembling a guillotine and says that he first tried poison but decided the . trap, invented in the 1600s, was the best technique and most . faithful to the historic role. Zoologists say that a decline in natural predators like wild cats and weasels has resulted in a boom in mole populations. One . single mole can make 30 molehills a day, which could see the entire . gardens pockmarked within weeks if a large number of the rodents are . burrowing within its walls. Speaking about King Louis XIV's insistence on ridding the grounds of moles, head gardener Alan Baraton said: 'Versailles was the greatest symbol of France. After everything (Louis) spent on the gardens, imagine if the moles had been allowed to run riot? All this money would have been squandered, wasted.' The molecatcher was rewarded with their own residence at Versailles. From the 1600s, the molecatchers all came from the same family - the Liards - until in 1812 Napoleon Bonaparte put a stop to the succession. 'The last Liard molecatcher was a bit of a party animal, and turned the residence into a cabaret and a brothel,' said Baraton. 'One day Napoleon was strolling in the gardens, and a prostitute came out and propositioned him. The molecatcher was immediately thrown out and that was the end of the residence.' The gardener also cheekily suggests that good mole-catching can save lives. In 1702, William III of England died from injuries he sustained after his horse tripped on a molehill. 'If the king had been more careful about the upkeep of his grass, he would not have been dead at 52 years old,' says Baraton.","Jerome Dormion, 36, is latest molecatcher in 330-year line of rodent-killers .

Three members of the same family have been hauled before a judge in New Jersey, two of whom have pleaded guilty to murder. Father and daughter, Thomas and Kathleen Dorsett  plead guilty to murdering her ex-husband, Stepehen Moore in New Jersey. Meanwhile, Kathleen's mother and Thomas's wife, Lesley Dorsett, also became involved in a despicable plot to murder her daughter's mother-in-law. Family of felons: Kathleen Dorsett, 38, and her parents, Lesley, 68, and Thomas Dorsett, 66, all of Ocean Township, appeared this morning before a judge in New Jersey . Kathleen Dorsett (left), the former elementary school teacher who, with her father, Thomas (right) is accused of killing her ex-husband . Kathleen Dorsett, 38, a former third-grade teacher, plead guilty to murdering her former husband in Ocean Township. The family told the judge they were angry about . the divorce decree and custody arrangements for the couple's daughter, . who was then 20 months old. She . told a judge today she sent 42-year-old Stephen Moore to his death in . the backyard, where her father was waiting to kill him, in 2010. Happier times: Kathleen Dorsett with her husband Stephan Moore on their wedding day in 2007 . Dorsett says she was changing her daughter's diaper when she heard Stephen scream in agony. But she didn't run outside to help him but instead kept changing their daughter's diaper . knowing that her father was carrying out their plan to kill the man by . hitting him in the head with a heavy cable. She then went outside to help her father put her husbands body in the trunk of a car. Her father, Thomas, 66, entered a guilty plea right after her. He says he started an argument with his former son-in-law, then struck him in the head with a cable. He was beaten to death. The callous duo then stuffed the body into the trunk of a car and set it ablaze. The father, Thomas Dorsett admitted he drove the car with Moore's body to Long Branch and then hired someone to set it on fire the following day. In Thursday's court hearing, lawyers and the defendants revealed how frustrating family problems turned into a murder plot. A few years after they married, prosecutors said Kathleen began telling her father there were problems in the marriage and that she did not think Moore could provide for the family. Thomas Dorsett said he provided for his daughter's family while she was married and that he helped take care of his granddaughter, who lived two houses away. 'That's all I did,' he told the court. Thomas Dorsett and Moore's relationship grew increasingly hostile. He acknowledged in Thursday's hearing that he had considered planting drugs on Moore or killing him earlier. Under the couple's divorce agreement, Thomas Dorsett was ordered to support Moore financially, including helping him find a place to live and that added to the strained relationship. Dorsett pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, attempted murder and second-degree conspiracy to desecrate human remains. Her father, Thomas, pleaded guilty to murder and arson-for-hire. Parents: Kathleen Dorsett's parents Lesley and Thomas. Her father is pleaded guilty to murder whilst her mother is pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder .

Partners in crime: The Dorsett family are hauled before a New Jersey judge today. Father Thomas leads the way closely followed by daughter Kathleen (both pleaded guilty to murder). Her mother Lesley completes the terrible trio . The teacher's mother, Lesley Dorsett, 68,  also appeared in court alongside the other family member. She has been charged with conspiracy and is accused of plotting whilst behind bars along with her daughter to have her former mother-in-law killed. Hitman: Anthony Morris was paid $1,000 as a down-payment in the plot to kill Kathleen Dorsett's mother-in-law but police got wind of the deal before the murder could take place . Prosecutors say in that part of the case, they tried to hire a hit-man to kill Stephen Moore’s mother. 'The goal was to kill (her) because we were afraid she was going to testify,' Lesley Dorsett said. The women were also upset Moore's mother was awarded temporary custody of Kathleen Dorsett's daughter. Lesley Dorsett said she took an envelope . with Moore's mother's name on it, stuffed it with cash and handed it . over at a department store to someone she believed was a hit man. However, . the supposed hit man was actually an undercover cop and Lesley Dorsett . was soon arrested. Police stopped the plot and Moore’s mother was not harmed. The plot was uncovered whilst Kathleen Dorsett was already in jail. She told a former inmate, Alice Anderson, 51, that she and her father made mistakes when they killed Stephen. She said that she needed someone to kill his mother. She asked for Anderson’s help. Anderson said she contacted her domestic partner, who instead of setting them up with a hitman, contacted police. She then agreed to wear a wire and capture evidence in order to bring charges and stop the plot. Lesley Dorsett was charged with paying the fake hitman $1,000 as a down payment. The family were all jailed on a $1.5 million bond. Kathleen Dorsett has explained her reasons for the initial killing. She has said wanted to move with her daughter to Florida but wasn't planning on bringing her ex-husband with - so she decided to get rid of him. Kathleen Dorsett faces 58 years in state prison, with no parole before 51 years. Thomas Dorsett faces 50 years in prison with no parole before 30 years. Lesley Dorsett faces eight years in prison with no parole before seven years. All three are scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 8.

French photographer Léo Calliard, 27, from Paris, teamed up with digital imaging retoucher Alexis Persani to dress the Greek Agora masterpieces in clothes more likely to be seen on Shoreditch hipsters. 'I had this idea when I was walking in the Louvre Museum looking at different sculptures,' Calliard tells MailOnline. 'These sculptures represent most of the time Gods or important people very far from our every day life. To make them ""iconic"", their sculptor made them naked, without any element from a specific period of time. Leo's Renaissance sculptures in clothes tell a meaningful story while providing hilarious viewing . Le Faune Barberini suns himself and relaxes in the nude in the original version of the statue . 'I realised that it would make a . great series of pictures if I could dress these statues up. Of course, . it was impossible to do it in real life as the museum wouldn't let me . touch the statues.' 'I started to think about the way to . do it and I finally found the right process. I made a casting of models . to find people with the same body shape as the statues. Then, I did a . photoshoot in a studio with these models dressed in hipster clothing. 'The important part of the shooting . was to recreate the same light on the models and to ask them to pose in . the same was as the statue they were representing. After that, it was . possible to mix both pictures in post-production, using Photoshop to . take the clothes from the studio shoot and put them on the pictures of . the statues that I shot in the museum.' A fine Greek Agora statue is kitted out in rolled up hems and rolled up sleeves for the Shoreditch effect . The original Aristaeus by Joseph Bosio is a nude sculpture . In line with his childhood . fascination with Einstein’s relativity research and study of . environments and imagines with the idea that reality 'might not be as we . see it', Calliard changes the way we perceive these classic figures. Le Faune Barberini by Edmé . Bouchardon leans back wearing green rolled up trousers, a bomber jacket . and neon shades while Michel de Montaigne by Jean-Baptist Stouf looks . dapper in a blue plaid shirt and Ray-Ban sunglasses. Aristaeus, God of the gardens by Artist François Joseph Bosio leans on a rock while appearing to wear a tight blue shirt with rolled up sleeves, rolled up trousers and trendy shades as Meleagre by Louis Simon Boizot is kitted out in rolled up orange shorts and a denim shirt. The work forces the viewer to question what is real and what could be real. Mums can be hipsters too: A female sculpture in Lennon shades and a faded band tee tends to her baby . Grandfather of hip: In a tight checked shirt and Ray Bans a philosophical type older figure becomes trends . Writing of his project, Callard says: . 'Who is to say that the figures presented in the stone of Greek Agora . were not the greatest representation of the human form known at that . time? 'The statues, with their clothes stripped away reveal a magnificence of shape & balance. But what were the Greeks wearing when they weren't posing for sculptors..? 'Appearance, in all its many nuances, present the character. 'Clothes maketh the man' as William Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet. 'One’s dress sense indicates one's priorities, choices, and lifestyle. Are you 'in' or are you 'out'? 'Hipster or Classic? Which tribe are you a member of? Which tribe were the men posing for these statues from?' Hipsters In Stone presents a twist on themes taking the ultimate from the Classic world and adding a modern, contemporary twist with cropped trousers, Ray-Bans and plaid shirts - 'making the icons iconic'.

Foolish: Banned driver James Phillips, 22, panicked when he was spotted riding his moped and decided to try and evade capture .

At one stage, a man tried to punch him . off the bike but narrowly missed him. Phillips was arrested for . dangerous driving, and driving while disqualified and without insurance. He admitted the offences as his barrister said he had been stupid. Bristol Crown Court heard Phillips, a roofer, ‘panicked’ when he saw police and attempted to flee.

"By . Rob Cooper, James Chapman and Becky Barrow . UPDATED: . 07:57 EST, 22 February 2012 . Axe: George Osborne is under pressure to scrap the 50p tax band introduced by Labour amid claims it makes no extra money . The controversial 50p tax band is 'not working' and revenues have fallen since it was introduced, new figures suggest. They appear to show the wealthy are finding ways to dodge the tax band levied on incomes of more than £150,000. In January, the tax take from those who . do self-assessment tax returns collapsed by more than £500million, . compared with the same month in 2011. They fell from £10.86billion to . £10.35billion. The figures have been . eagerly awaited by George Osborne as they provide . the first evidence of the usefulness of the tax rate. This is because January 31 was the . deadline for all self-assessment forms to be filed for 2010-2011, the . first full tax year since it was introduced. The Centre for Economics and Business . Reseach said it provided evidence that the 50p tax rate may be . starting to hit receipts. The figures will add to pressure on the Coalition to drop the levy amid fears it is forcing entrepreneurs to relocate abroad. Separate figures, also published yesterday, provided more evidence that wealthy people are taking steps to avoid paying the tax. Corporation tax was up 9.3 per cent on last January, but total income tax payments were up only 2.4 per cent - a surprisingly small amount. This suggests in order to avoid the 50p band, many business executives decided to pay themselves a big bonus or dividend before it came into effect so they did not lose half their pay to the Inland Revenue. Mike Warburton, senior tax partner at Grant Thornton, the accountants, said: ‘I had one client who took a £10million dividend before 50p tax came into force in April 2010. Tax take: Eagerly awaited figures suggest 50p rate levied on people earning more than £150,000 is making no money . ‘He just said: ""That will see me through until it is scrapped"".' Mr . Warburton said: 'My own view is that the tax raised by the 50p band is . very questionable as to whether it actually raises any additional . revenue. 'It is a big concern that it is putting off international business people from investing in this country. 'We need a big sign saying ""Open for Business"" above the UK but a 50p tax rate is exactly the reverse.' The . tax has also been heavily criticised by the Institute of Directors, the . business lobby group, which said it is ‘totally unjustified’ and . ‘foolish’. In April . 2010, it warned the next tax rate would raise ‘little or no tax’ despite . the Treasury’s insisted it would be worth up to £2.5billion a year. As . the latest figures show, it warned there would be many ‘obvious tax . planning opportunities’ with accountants also devising loopholes to . avoid it. Yesterday a . Treasury source said the Chancellor has always made clear the 50p tax . rate is ‘temporary’. HMRC is currently doing an assessment of how much . revenue it actually raises.","Wealthy 'dodging' the tax on incomes over £150,000 .

Marks & Spencer is to stop opening new general stores in the UK amid a shift to internet shopping. The company will build four new large outlets over the next three years, but then call a halt to 129 years of bricks and mortar expansion. Bosses believe that the popularity of 'click and collect' means people will be buying more online and either collecting from its existing stores or getting home deliveries. Stopping construction: Marks & Spencer will call a halt to 129 years of bricks and mortar expansion . The firm, which was started in 1884, has opened on average six stores every year in a race to reach as much of the UK population as possible. As a result it now has some 766 UK outlets, including 419 of its specialist Simply Food convenience stores. But in a sign of the times. the chief executive Marc Bolland said booming sales online mean that the M&S store network will have reached saturation and there will be no more new clothing stores. 'The number of net new stores will be flat due to the growth of dotcom within three years,' he said. 'This means that we will continue to maintain the estate by closing some of the older stores and replacing them with new ones in better locations, but we will not be growing our general merchandise chain in the UK.' The move is in tune with a shift by John Lewis, the big supermarkets and others, which are scaling back plans for new large bricks and mortar outlets. Britain leads the world in terms of internet shopping, with a greater share and value of spending than any other nation, including the U.S.. No new stores: Customers look at a food display in the food hall at a Marks & Spencer shop in central London . The M&S policy follows that of John Lewis, pictured here in Oxford Street, London . However, the other side of that equation is that national chains no longer need a store in every town centre. The proposals by M&S, which will continue to open small Simply Food outlets, emerged as the company yesterday revealed a six per cent fall in profits. Profits for the last financial year were £665.2million - taking them well below the £1billion plus made as recently as 2008. Mr Bolland admitted its fashions 'have not been good enough', but he said a new Winter/Autumn collection has been well received. Despite losing market share to budget rivals such as Primark, Marks & Spencer remains the UK's biggest clothing retailer. Asked about the poor performance in fashion, Mr Bolland admitted: 'It's been not good enough but still we have got the largest business in the UK by far.' He said M&S is beating rivals on quality and is now aiming 'to bring something that really delights and surprises the customer'. He added: 'Secondly, it's about style. We can bring improved style, more trends to customers than we have done so far and where we have done that in our womenswear it has really helped.' The company is pinning its hopes of a revival on a new upmarket Autumn and Winter collection devised by the former boss at Debenhams and Jaeger, Belinda Earl. The fashion press has welcomed the range, although analysts fear some of the lines will be too expensive for its core customers. The womenswear collection includes a British-made wool double-breasted coat at £349. A new 'Best of British' line in menswear includes a grey windowpane check single-breasted wool suit at £799 and handmade double monk strap leather shoes at £285. While the company's recent record on clothing and general merchandise has been poor, M&S has largely been rescued by the success of its food. Figures published yesterday showed underlying sales of general merchandise in 2012/13, including clothes, were down by 4.1 per cent, while food was up by 1.7 per cent. Once, the impact of new stores, overseas and internet sales were added to the equation, total sales were up by 1.3 per cent. Despite this small increase, underlying profits fell from £687.2million to £665.2million. City analysts were not surprised by the bad news and suggested the pressure is on Mr Bolland to deliver an improvement or move on. John Ibbotson, director of consultants Retail Vision, complained: 'M&S seems like a rabbit in the headlights. However many operational improvements it makes, it's all immaterial unless the retailer can rediscover its panache.'","Company will call a halt to 129 years of bricks and mortar expansion .

A millionaire businessman today won his fight to keep a large Islamic slogan which he painted on the side of his house. Mahmood Ali had been ordered to remove the words because they were a form of advertising comparable to a McDonald's billboard. But he appealed the ruling, and successfully argued that the slogan was not disproportionately large or garish and did not damage the character of his neighbourhood. 'Breaches planning laws': Millionaire businessman Mahmood Ali has won a court battle over this Islamic slogan on his house in Newport, South Wales, after the council ordered it be removed because it is 'advertising' The . 54-year-old painted an Arabic message meaning, 'There is no god but . Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,' on the side of his semi-detached . eight-bedroom home in Newport, south Wales. The . council later ruled that he required planning permission to display the . slogan, saying that it fell under the same category as a commercial . advertisement. Today . planning inspector Tim Belcher overturned that initial ruling, judging . that the sign was not so obtrusive that it damaged the interests of . other locals. Mr Ali . spoke of his joy at the decision, saying that it set a positive . precedent for others who wished to express their faith publicly. 'It’s a good way forward so people can feel comfortable living in the UK,' he said. 'If a neighbour wanted to put a George cross on their house I wouldn’t have any objection whatsoever. I would respect it fully.' 'Obtrusive': The message, in 2ft-high lettering, is written across a first-floor archway on the detached house . The message on the side of Mahmood Ali's house comes from the Islamic creed, known as shahada, which declares the belief in the oneness of God and acceptance of Muhammad as his prophet. In English, this translates as: 'There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God' A single, honest recitation of the shahadah in Arabic is all that is required for a person to become a Muslim. This declaration, or statement of faith, is called the kalimah. In some sects in Shia Islam, the creed is expanded with the addition of a phrase concerning Ali at the end to say: 'and Ali is the wali (friend) of God'. Taking this creed is one of the five pillars of Islam. The complete shahadah cannot be found in the Quran, but comes from hadiths, sayings or  or tacit approvals ascribed either validly or invalidly to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He added: 'It is not there as an advertisement, the sign was just to bless the house, that’s the purpose. 'The green colour means peace. This sort of thing is common in cities like Birmingham and Manchester.' Mr Ali had the sign placed onto the side of his £750,000 home in Newport. But the city's council later decided . he didn't have the right planning permission to display the message . across the home's stone archway. The . sign, which is around two metres wide and 60cm high, includes the . declaration of the Islamic faith, called the Islamic creed. Business consultant Mr Ali has also applied for permission to illuminate the sign in low voltage lighting. A family member, who did not wish to be named, added: 'It's our home and we should be free to do whatever we want. 'We're suppose to have freedom of speech in this country and be allowed to express our faith however we please.' Mr Ali applied for retrospective permission, but it was turned down. Legal fight: Council officers accused the slogan of being similar to an advert for the likes of McDonald's . Newport Council argued that the sign is an obtrusive 'advertisement' according to planning regulations. Under . these guidelines, an advertisement includes any word, letter, model, . sign, placard, board or notice used for advertising, making an . announcement or direction. A council statement read: 'The property is domestic property and is not a mosque where such signs might be expected. 'The . sign consists of letters and words that announce religious faith and so . can be considered to be an advertisement and express planning consent . is required. 'The . advertisement is prominently sited upon the host building and is also . prominent. Its size and position on the building make it obtrusive.'","'There is no god but Allah, and Mohammed is his messenger,' sign reads .

Smiling for the camera, they appear like any other happy newlyweds, ready to embark on their life together. But a week after this picture was taken, Jamie Starbuck had killed and dismembered wife Debbie, ready to embark on a £65,000 round-the-world trip paid for with her inheritance. Starbuck – who brazenly charted his globetrotting adventures in a blog entitled Diary of a Misanthrope – was yesterday starting a life sentence after admitting the murder of his 44-year-old wife. Horrific: Jamie and Debbie Starbuck pictured on their wedding day. Debbie is thought to have been killed eight days later . Mrs Starbuck was last seen  alive six . days after their wedding  in April 2010. Her body has never been found . and it is believed that Starbuck killed his wife then dismembered her . body before burning it at their home. Judge Michael Stokes QC said it was . ‘one of the most horrific’ murder cases he had dealt with and ordered . Starbuck to serve at least 30 years before being considered for parole. Divorcee Starbuck married Debbie Cooper within nine months of meeting . her on the internet. They lived in a rented house in Old Basford, . Nottingham. The self-employed proof-reader, who had no children, had inherited £150,000 a few years before she met Starbuck. Murderer Jamie Starbuck visited a total of 32 countries during his 31 month tour including: . Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Poland, the . Netherlands, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, India, Indonesia, South . Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, . Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Columbia, . Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, Mexico, America, Canada, and finally Peru. Concerns about Mrs Starbuck’s . whereabouts were not raised until two years after the wedding when one . of her friends contacted police to say that he had not heard from her. Officers discovered her passport had . expired and that money had been transferred from Mrs Starbuck’s account . to her husband’s. He knew her passwords after setting up an online . account for her. Detectives were able to prove that her husband spent almost £65,000 of his dead wife’s money to fund his travels abroad. Starbuck, a one-time amateur . photographer and cleaner, was arrested at Heathrow Airport in January as . he stepped off a flight from Brazil. He was found to  have two of . Debbie’s bank cards in his wallet. An examination of his laptop revealed . a ‘confession’, in which he admitted Debbie’s murder. It read: ‘I had . planned for it to be quick … I never expected you to be so durable.’ Admission: Jamie Starbuck was jailed for a minimum of 30 years after pleading guilty to killing his wife of six days Debbie and using her money to travel the world . The 36-year-old fled on a one-way . ticket to Amsterdam within a month of the murder in April 2010. He spent . the next 31 months travelling the globe, sending updates to his wife’s . family from her own email account to make it appear she was enjoying the . trip of a lifetime. Bizarrely, he also charted his . adventures – which took in 32 countries across five continents – in a . blog which gave no mention of his wife. In his final post from the Peruvian . capital, Lima, two days before  flying back he wrote: ‘I am literally . leaving paradise to face my destiny in England. 'We have learnt that Jamie Starbuck is a . very controlling man, who engineered a situation to ensure he could . benefit financially from Debbie’s disappearance' Det Chief Insp Rob Griffin . ‘I left the UK a long time ago in . search of … well, in all honesty I was running away. From life and . responsibility; justice and my past.’ He said he had been searching for a . place ‘where I wouldn’t be judged or condemned for the sometimes . bafflingly bizarre decisions I make’. At Nottingham Crown Court, Judge . Stokes said Starbuck was guilty of a ‘grotesque and inhumane act’. He . added: ‘On more than 75 homicides, I’m trying hard to think of one as . horrific as this. ‘This case shows the categories of wickedness are never closed.’ Detective Chief Inspector Rob Griffin, of Nottinghamshire Police said the investigation had been ‘extremely complex’.

She added: ‘The . unbelievable and shocking fact that she is dead, has been dead for so . long and we didn’t even know. ‘For nearly three years we … were . living with the illusion that she was alive and happy and travelling . around the world with Jamie. ‘The thought that her bones lay . scattered, burnt and lonely  on a remote hillside or in a  dark wood . somewhere leaves us feeling desolate.’ Horrific: Jamie and Debbie Starbuck pictured on their wedding day. Debbie is thought to have been killed eight days later . Debbie Starbuck's sister Beth Jones paid tribute to her sister after today's verdict. She said: . 'We are heartbroken to lose our beautiful sister and cherished daughter. We are still finding it difficult to believe what has happened and we don’t think that we will ever be able to come to terms with it. 'Deb was bright, adventurous, and full of life. She was kind, loving and loyal and had so many friends who loved her. She was the sort of person who would always go to great lengths to be there when you needed her. 'She was always interested in learning new things and meeting new people. Sadly this led her to meet Jamie Starbuck who took all that away from her.' 'There are so many things about this that are almost impossible to bear. The unbelievable and shocking fact that she is dead, has been dead for so long and we didn’t even know. 'For nearly three years we thought we were communicating with her until, with the slow unravelling of the threads, we knew she could no longer be with us. 'We had no opportunity to say goodbye and no opportunity to grieve. We were living with the illusion that she was alive and happy and travelling around the world with Jamie. She added: 'Everything that we have been told about what happened to Deb leads us to a place of unimaginable horror. We are haunted and tormented by the suffering that she must have endured in the violent act that caused her death. 'Having no clarity about what happened and where she might be is a cruel and ongoing torture for all of us. 'At the age of 91 our poor father should not have to bear the sorrow of losing a child in this unnatural and devastating manner. 'He has always been a stoical and proud man who survived the death of our mother nearly 14 years ago but he visibly crumpled when DCI Rob Griffin told the ghastly facts of what had happened. He has remained so. 'There could have been some comfort if we were able to find her body and lay her to rest. After what we heard today any hope of that seems futile. The thought that her bones lay scattered, burnt and lonely on a remote hillside or in a dark wood somewhere leaves us feeling desolate. 'Jamie has taken everything from Deb.

Now that the house is complete, the couple plan to devote more time to charity work. ‘This is my way of thanking Tampa for allowing me to be the way I am today,’ said June Simpson. ‘Everything we did, we were trying to give back.’ The Simpsons plan to open their home to nonprofit and civic organizations in need of space to hold charity events and functions.

A California woman is suing a veterinary clinic for extortion over claims a vet tried to have her arrested for animal cruelty charges because she could not afford a $10,000 emergency surgery after dog was hit by a car. Karen Kelly says she took her dog Mojo to Advanced Critical Care and Internal Medicine Inc., a 24-hour veterinary clinic, in her hometown of Tustin, California, after the dog was hit and dragged by a car in July 2011. In a matter of a few hours, Ms Kelly racked up more than $1,300 in veterinary bills. She was told the her dog would need surgery that that would cost an additional $10,000 - and there was no guarantee Mojo would survive, according to the lawsuit filed in Orange County courts. The dog Mojo is still alive, even though owner Karen Kelly took him from the veterinarian's office against the vet's advice . Ms Kelly is suing the clinic for . $1million, claiming civil extortion, intentional infliction of emotional . distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

She called friends and family members, who didn't have money to lend her for the procedure, either, the lawsuit says. She also applied for a line of credit at the veterinary clinic, but was denied. When Ms Kelly asked if she could bring Mojo home so he could be take him to her regular vet the next day, she was told that she would have to sign a form saying it was against the vet's medical advice. The veterinarians further warned that 'they were going to report her to the authorities for 'animal cruelty,' which is a crime,' according to the lawsuit. The clinic, Advanced Critical Care and Internal Medicine Inc., has since changed names and changed owners. None of the former owners would comment . Ms Kelly opted to take her dog home. It is unknown what care Mojo received after leaving the Advanced Critical Care clinic, but he never underwent the surgery recommended by the veterinarians.

A soldier’s wife says she has been condemned to losing her sight after local health chiefs denied her access to eye injections available elsewhere on the NHS. Dawn Thomas had hoped that an appeal - backed by a national charity might sway managers to allow her drug that can save her sight from a rare disease. But South Staffordshire Primary Care Trust confirmed its initial decision to deny the 44-year-old the medication. The treatment for her rare degenerative eye condition would involve several injections which can cost up to £800 each. She now fears having to give up her job and driving - and that her family may even be forced to sell its house to fund private treatment. The secretary, from Branston, Staffordshire, said: 'I’m upset and want to cry. 'I just feel all hope has gone.The health chiefs are heartless. 'They’ve got a job to do and I’m only a name on a piece of paper as far as they are concerned. 'They’ve sentenced me to blindness and shortened the quality of my life but just don’t care. 'If they put themselves in my situation then maybe they would be more understanding.' Treatment: Lucentis injections proved effective in treating PXE sight problems in trials . A spokesman for the Royal National Institute for the Blind said: 'The PCT’s decision to once again refuse to fund Dawn’s treatment and save her remaining sight will have a devastating impact on her life. 'The refusal to fund an effective and proven treatment is a cruel decision that is likely to mean Dawn has to stop working. 'There will be a massive impact on her quality of life and a biglong term cost to the taxpayer. We strongly urge the PCT to rethink itsdecision. 'If there’s an approved treatment available which will save a person’ssight then it should be given to the patient. It’s vital that peoplediagnosed with sight threatening conditions have the opportunity toreceive proven and timely treatments.' The PCT has denied funding to treat Mrs . Thomas’s pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a hereditary condition in which . the elastic fibres that normally occur in the skin, eyes and . cardiovascular system become calcified. Local Primary Care Trusts will be stopped from blacklisting drugs . approved by the NHS drug rationing watchdog from April 2013, according . to the Department of Health. NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson has written to . the leaders of the PCTs and Strategic Health Authorities telling them . to start removing drugs from local blacklists that have been approved by . the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. Sir David said once NICE has given approval 'there should be no further barriers' for the medicines. It follows a number of complaints about post-code lotteries where care has been available in some counties but not in others. Although diagnosed with the condition when she was 21, it has given her increasing cause for concern in the past 12 months and she has now lost vision in her left eye and is having trouble with her right. Desperate for help, Mrs Thomas, supported by a consultant at the Royal Derby Hospital, made an initial funding bid to the PCT which was turned down. The PCT has since reviewed her case after receiving new information from the Macular Disease Society but has again thrown it out, confirming her case was not exceptional enough. With evidence suggesting PXE patients elsewhere in England are receiving treatment, Mrs Thomas appears to be the victim of a ‘postcode lottery’. Mrs Thomas has asked Burton MP Andrew Griffiths for help and plans to consult an RNIB solicitor and the Royal British Legion. 'I have to try and remain strong and hopeful and fight it,' she said.

Representatives of Radiohead today denied local media reports that the band's guitarist Jonny Greenwood is hiding out in a rural Brazilian hotel to 'wait for the end of the world'. Numerous Brazilian media have claimed the 41-year-old is holed up in a self-sufficient guest-house in rolling countryside near the city of Sao Luiz do Paraitinga, in the state of Sao Paulo, in preparation for December 21. That day marks the end of the Mayan Calendar and is considered by some as the date that will mark the end of the world. Scroll down for video . Brazilian media have reported that Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood is currently waiting for the 'end of the world' in a rural guest-house in Sao Paulo . Owner of the Catuçaba hotel, Frenchman Emmanuel Rengade, said: 'The reason why he's here is to get away, because hotels like this preserve the privacy of the guests and he does not want publicity.' The city's Tourism Minister, Eduardo de Oliveira Coelho, told the Folha de Sao Paulo news website that Greenwood had arrived earlier this month. He also claimed that other band members were expected to join him in the next few days. But management for the band Radiohead, pictured, say Jonny Greenwood is not in Brazil . The presence of the star was confirmed to the publication by both the politician and hotel owner. Coelho added that Greenwood was planning to provide free classes to youth in the city and extend his stay there if the supposed Mayan premonition did not come about. But the band's management, Courtyard management, today insisted that the musician is not even in the country and the reports are completely untrue. Radiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide and were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone's list of The Greatest Artists of All Time in 2005. Both Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien have both been included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists while Thom Yorke is in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.","Local media has claimed Jonny Greenwood, 41, is staying in a self-sufficient guest-house near Sao Luiz do Paraitinga in Sao Paulo .

Clever man: Lee Beaumont was plagued by cold calls so hit back with his own premium-rate phone number . FED up with the constant barrage of unwanted calls, Lee Beaumont decided it was time to take revenge. The businessman turned the tables on the cold-callers by  setting up his own premium rate phone number – and has since pocketed £300 as a result. Mr Beaumont said he was inundated with calls to his landline from  salesmen, especially those offering help with compensation claims for mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance, so decided to make them pay to speak to him. The 25-year-old paid £10 plus VAT to set up a personal 0871 landline and now makes money every time he receives an unsolicited phone call. He said it was ‘extremely easy’ to set up the number online. He chose an 0871 number because it was more profitable than one starting with 0845 or 0844. Mr Beaumont said he gave out the premium rate number whenever he needed to talk to utility companies but had a separate line for his friends and family to call. ‘I was getting annoyed at the PPI calls I was constantly getting so I thought there must be a way to make money out of them,’ he said. ‘I decided I would get an 08 number and realised if I had an 0871 number they would be charged 10p a minute. ‘Out of this I get to keep 9p for . every minute, so I phoned up all of my service providers and told them I . would be changing my number. This was in 2011 and I’ve made £300 from . it.’ Mr Beaumont, who runs an e-commerce . business from his home in Leeds, said the cold calls had now dried up, . but he continues to make a few pounds a month from utilities  trying to . sell their products. ‘Companies ring me up and the first . thing they ask is, “Why do you have an 0871 number?”,’ he said. ‘I tell . them it is so I can make money out of them. ‘Npower were particularly annoyed and . wouldn’t call me. They’d keep emailing me, but I’d tell them to call me. Eventually they gave in, but I have left them now and they regularly . call asking me to rejoin them.’ Frustration: The calls came, as usual, in the evening during Lee's favourite shows, so he spend £10 plus VAT on his own 0871 number (file picture) Far from dreading the nuisance calls, Mr Beaumont now says he relishes the sound of the phone ringing. ‘I actually want to be cold-called . now,’ he said. ‘I’d definitely recommend everyone to do it – it . definitely stops the PPI calls.’ But premium number regulator Phone Pay Plus yesterday warned other members of the public against trying the same thing. A spokesman told Radio 4’s You And .

A 51-year-old American was stabbed to death with sharpened metal poles by a band after he refused to stop singing in a Thai bar. Bobby Ray Carter Jr, from Dallas, Texas, had been on vacation in the popular Tourist region of Ao Nang in Krabi with his son, Adam, who was also stabbed in the attack. Mr Carter, who has an 18-month-old daughter, had been enjoying a night out with his 27-year-old son in the Longhorn Saloon in the early hours of Wednesday, when a fight broke out. Attack: Bobby Ray Carter and his son, Adam, were on vacation in Thailand when he was stabbed to death . Thai police have arrested three musicians, who are accused of stabbing the two tourists with sharpened rods outside the bar. According to Phuket Wan Tourism News, the steel rods used in the fatal attack are a popular weapon with locals. Lieutenant Colonel Jongrak Pimthong said that Mr Carter had started to sing with the band and refused to leave the stage, after having a few drinks. On its website, the bar advertises 'jamming with the band' as one of its events and claims to be a friendly nightspot. A Krabi tourist police officer told Fox News: '[Mr Carter] and his son quarelled with all three musicians because he wouldn't stop singing despite the musicians taking a break.' 'He then demanded the money he had already given as a tip back. But the real fight broke out outside of that pub. He was stabbed twice and died while on the way to local hospital,' Lieutenant Colonel Attapong Seanjaiwuth added. Well traveled: Bobby Ray Carter was president of an electronics company, with offices in Texas and China . Crime scene: The father and son were stabbed outside the Long Horn Saloon in Ao Nang . Mr Carter's son, who runs the Chinese branch of their LED Cool Lights business, was stabbed in the arm during the attack and is recovering in hospital. The alleged attackers have been named as Ratikorn Ramin, 27, Sathit Somsa, 40, and Noppanan Yoddecha, 26, according to the Phuket Wan News. The fatal attack comes at a time of increased concern for the safety of tourists in that region of Thailand, as well as other popular tourist spots in the country.

"By . Amanda Platell . PUBLISHED: . 19:50 EST, 18 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:09 EST, 18 October 2012 . Blood trickled down my face like raindrops down a window pane — so much blood that I can honestly say I’ve experienced few things as frightening in my life. Admittedly I had volunteered to subject myself to a radical new treatment known as the Vampire Facelift and I had feared there might be some blood — but I hadn’t anticipated looking as though I’d been attacked by bloodsuckers and left with a face that bore a close resemblance to a novelty Halloween mask. So why would anyone even think of putting themselves through such a procedure, you might ask? Treatment: Why would anyone even think of putting themselves through such a procedure, you might ask? I could blame it all on actress Anna Friel, 36, a beautiful woman whose youthful face belies her years. She is one of the many celebrities who swear by the Vampire Facelift and has been extolling the virtues of regular treatments, enthusing about what a difference they have made to her complexion. But the truth is, I’d been swotting up on the VF some time before Ms Friel went public. Despite an eye-watering £600 price tag, the biggest relief is that it’s not a facelift at all and involves no knives, nips or tucks, but does have the rejuvenating effect of surgery. Closer research reveals that it is a 90-minute procedure which boosts the creation of new blood cells and collagen, and promises the best and safest skin rejuvenation known to woman. The even better news? No incisor bites to the neck, no nocturnal rampaging, no garlic required. And so I surrendered myself to Lee Garrett, an aesthetic nurse practitioner at Freedomhealth, the cosmetic clinic in London I’ve been using for years. Over to you: I surrendered myself to Lee Garrett, an aesthetic nurse practitioner at Freedomhealth in London . While I lay back listening to an anaesthetising Snow Patrol track on my iPod, dressed in a blue surgical gown, Lee applied a thick white cream to my face, neck and décolletage to numb the pain he was about to inflict upon me. Waiting for the topical anaesthetic to . kick in, I looked away as Lee took two vials of blood from my arm using a . needle and syringe. Happy: I've had it done twice now and I'll definitely be going back for more . It didn’t hurt but I am squeamish, so it wasn’t an especially comfortable experience. Lee then put the blood into a machine which spins it around at high speed for six minutes until the red and white blood cells have separated — a process that produces a plasma rich with platelets, or very small cells, which stimulate the growth of more cells. The blood collection tube has three distinct parts and looks a bit like one of those old ice lollies — at the bottom are the dark red blood cells, in the middle are the white cells and at the top is the ‘liquid gold’, which are the platelets. Only the platelets are reinjected back into the face, neck and decolletage and the rest is thrown away. This whole process has to happen quickly because the platelets need to be back inside the body within ten minutes, otherwise they coagulate and turn to jelly — which is exactly how my stomach felt at this point. Lee extracted the plasma from the top . of the two vials using a syringe, then injected it into the ‘trouble . spots’ in my face — the wrinkles under my eyes, the ‘tram lines’ that . run from my nose down to my mouth — and into my neck. It was at that point that Lee held up the mirror to my face and all I could see were rivulets of blood running down it. What on earth had I done to myself? And would my face ever recover from the gory mess it had so suddenly become? I’d wanted to look like a dewy-faced A-list actress in the prime of her life, not like someone who was auditioning for a Hammer horror film. But for all the shock of that moment, I did feel the Vampire Facelift made good sense. Pricey: You need three Vampire Facelifts - £1,800 in all - for the best results, at four to six-week intervals . We’ve all read about the challenges and dangers of cosmetic surgery, and heard negative stories about Botox and facial fillers. By contrast, the VF is non-invasive and involves no foreign bodies. The restorative powers of a person’s blood being injected back into them were first discovered by the medical world and, in the case of the VF, by sports doctors. Beautiful actress: Anna Friel, 36, is one of the many celebrities who swear by the Vampire Facelift . They regularly inject an injured . athlete’s blood back into a muscle to accelerate recovery. This helps to . rebuild cells quickly and stimulates collagen, a protein which gives . skin firmness and strength. We lose about one per cent of our collagen every year from the moment we are born, so at 54 more than half of mine has gone. I . first heard about the VF when Dannii Minogue confessed to being a . devotee. Her enthusiasm was echoed by Lee, who described it as the . state-of-the art procedure when it comes to non-surgical facelifts. With . all those pin pricks and all that blood, it’s not a treatment for the . squeamish. However, it’s no more painful than several other procedures . I’ve had, including Pellevé (a wrinkle reduction system where the face . is ironed) and the Blue Peel (an acid peel that leaves you looking like a . Smurf). It is undeniably . expensive. You need three Vampire Facelifts — £1,800 in all — for the . best results, at four to six-week intervals. After that, a session is recommended every six months for general maintenance. I’ve . had it done twice now and I’ll definitely be going back for more. It’s . about two months since my second session, and I can see a big difference . in my face, especially around my eyes. My skin is fresher and plumper, and there are fewer lines, especially on my neck and around my eyes. The . test of a good procedure is not that people can tell you’ve had . something done — Anne Robinson’s facelift would be an example of that — . but that they simply think you look well, happy and youthful. My . face also passed ‘The Brenda Test’. Brenda’s the make-up artist on the . Sunday morning television show on which I sometimes appear. Separated: The blood collection tube has three distinct parts and looks a bit like one of those old ice lollies . Apart from Lee, Brenda’s the only person who ever sees my skin close-up. When I did the programme a couple of weeks ago, she said my skin looked amazing. I noticed it has also worked wonders on my neck, an area so vulnerable to the signs of ageing. I've . had it done twice now and I’ll definitely be going back for more. It's . about two months since my second session, and I can see a big difference . in my face, especially around my eyes . The VF doesn’t give you a frozen Botox face, nor the unnaturally puffed-up cheeks which can result from badly done fillers. I’ve never much liked having my blood taken, and having it reinjected back into me was an entirely novel experience, which did leave me feeling rather queasy. But, nausea aside, it does soften and remove lines, especially around the eyes where wrinkles are the hardest to get rid of without surgery, and it definitely plumps up the skin.

Police are investigating the ‘Fagin’ lifestyle of a jobless mother of 11 who claims she only survives thanks to a network of shoplifters. Heather Frost, who has never worked and is reputed to claim up to £60,000 a year in benefits, was filmed buying goods from sellers at her front door, including washing powder and clothes. ‘Everybody has to get their goods off shoplifters don’t they?’ she said. Earlier this year, it emerged the 37-year-old and her family were to be given a £500,000 eco-home paid for by the taxpayer. Now she is causing outrage again after she appeared to praise shoplifters who supply her with cheap groceries. Home: Frost stands in the doorway of her current home which is to be totally remodelled at taxpayer's expense . Putting them away: The mother of 11 then started stacking the goods, like these air fresheners, she 'couldn't survive without' New buys: Ms Frost appeared to have bought these clothes as part of a consignment delivered to her door . Family affair: Frost pictured with her 11 children including Toby, 19,  and Sophie, 21, who also live on benefits . On a television documentary, Miss Frost was shown paying for the allegedly stolen household goods. It has been suggested they were supplied by local shoplifters who sell them on at knockdown prices. After paying a ‘seller’ for the items at her front door, she was seen in the documentary stacking her purchases in the kitchen. She then told an interviewer: ‘I couldn’t survive without these. ‘I’d be lost without my shoplifters because they bring my washing powder. They do it at half price what the shop does.’ Unrepentant: Heather Frost with one of her nine daughters at their taxpayer-funded six-bedroom home . Outspoken: In the aftermath of the controversy, Frost appeared on Good Morning to defend herself . Miss . Frost was being featured in On Benefits And Proud, which was made in . the wake of widespread coverage of her plans to move into a brand new . taxpayer-funded home with her family. But her comments have prompted a police investigation into her shopping habits at home in Churchdown, Gloucestershire. A . spokesman for Gloucestershire Police said: ‘We are aware of the . comments that were made on the Channel 5 programme regarding shoplifting . and the purchase of stolen goods. 'A 37-year-old woman has been officially interviewed after a caution at a police station and an investigation is ongoing.’ The documentary about families whose lives are supported by the state claimed Miss Frost receives £60,000 a year in benefits. Screened last Monday, it featured her quest to move into a council-funded  eco-home. She said on the show: ‘Yes, it is my choice to have a large family but there is no law to say how many kids you can have.’ Miss Frost was due to move into a specially built six-bedroom home after she complained that her existing home was not safe. Just weeks later she was refused the new home in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, when it was said not to meet her needs. The . 1,850 sq ft detached property was designed with state-of-the-art . technology to cut electricity bills – but it has now been given to . another family. She currently lives with her children, aged from three to 21, in two terrace houses that have been knocked together. In . the film, the foul-mouthed 37-year-old from Gloucestershire is seen . telling her friends that as far as angry taxpayers are concerned, her . view is 'f*** the lot of them.' 'It's a f***ing s****y council house,' she adds. 'Everyone wants to believe what they read in the f***ing papers don't . they. 'Every child needs a house, a roof over their head I should say, . don't they? It . wasn't our choice for the council to build a new house, it was theirs. 'No one's put a gun to their f***ing head. I think they [other people] . are jealous. F*** the lot of them! Everyone's entitled to their opinion . but everyone's entitled to a place to live.' Frost, . who receives the equivalent of £60,000 a year, is now looking forward . to a council-funded renovation of her current home, which will see the . two three-bedroom houses she currently occupies knocked together to . create a permanent six-bedroom house. Controversial: This is the moment Ms Frost opened the door and apparently paid for stolen goods . Renovation: This three-bedroom home and the one next door will be renovated for the Frost family . The cost of the renovation will run into thousands of pounds, and includes a new kitchen and bedrooms. But, . despite the vast expense to taxpayers, who spend a staggering £100 . million on benefits every day according to Government figures, Frost, . who has never had a full time job, says the system is put there to help . people like her. 'Yes, people don't agree with the . benefits system and s*** like that but the benefits system is put there . to help people that can't go out and work,' she asserts. 'Yes, it's my choice and my . decision to have a large family but there's no law out there to say how . many kids you can have or can't have. There's people out there with more . kids than me, that's my argument.' She adds: 'Fred . West or someone who murdered someone wouldn't have got as much s*** in . the press as what I got. 'You only get what you're entitled to. We . have to budget. You know, a weekly shop costs quite a bit, then gas and . electric for both houses - it's all got to come out of it. 'By the end . of the week, you can guarantee you're skint. We can't afford to take the . kids to Spain or on posh holidays.' Frost says she is looking forward to . seeing what kind of response those who do eventually get the £500,000 . home she almost moved into. 'Are the people who get it going to get as . much grief as what I got?' she asks. 'The £500,000 house was built for somebody. So lets . see if they get the s*** I got for being allocated it.' Miss . Frost, who is sterile after suffering from cervical cancer in 2011, . first became pregnant when she was 15 to a 23-year-old boyfriend who . ended up in prison.

She said: 'Running was such a big challenge for me. I was too embarrassed to be seen running on public roads so I went to a local reservoir and ran there instead. Just taking those first running steps was an accomplishment, it was such an unknown feeling, like someone trying skiing for the first time. 'At first I struggled to run a mile but I kept pushing myself.' BEFORE . Breakfast: Toast . Lunch: Sandwiches . Dinner: Takeway . Snacks: Crisps and chocolate . Drinks: Coke and other fizzy drinks .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 13:48 EST, 7 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:59 EST, 7 October 2013 . President Obama used a photo-op at a Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters to blame Republicans for shutdown-related furloughs at the agency. But his speech made no mention of the veto threat his administration leveled at FEMA funding just three days ago. The latest round of saber-rattling on the federal government's partial shutdown came as Washington, D.C. tangled with 45-mph winds and tornado watches, and as midwestern and Gulf of Mexico states recovered from violent weekend storms and threats of devastation from Tropical Storm Karen. Obama highlighted the government furloughs of hundreds of FEMA employees, including 200 who were called back to work over the weekend – half of whom are likely headed back off the job now that weather cycles have returned to normal. Angel wings or devil horns? Obama chose to focus on the partial government shutdown's impact on FEMA, despite his administration's threat that he would veto a Republican bill specifically funding the emergency agency . They were 'impacted by . the current government shutdown' and 'their job has been made more difficult,' the president told FEMA employees, praising them for working under 'less . than optimal situations.' 'There are enough Republican and Democratic votes in the House of Representatives right now to end this shutdown immediately, with no partisan strings attached,' Obama insisted. 'The House should hold that vote today. If Republicans and Speaker Boehner are saying there are not enough votes, then they should prove it. Let the bill go to the floor and let’s see what happens. Just vote.' But neither the president nor his advisers on the scene addressed a Republican bill that passed Friday . in the House, aimed squarely at restoring FEMA funding. Twenty-three . Democrats joined all 224 voting Republicans in passing the measure . 247-16. The administration had announced six hours earlier that if the Senate should . consider and pass the FEMA funding measure separately from a bill . restoring the rest of government, the president would . veto it. Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, responded to Obama's speech by directing reporters to look at Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for answers. 'The bill . passed the House last week and is awaiting action by Senate Democrats,' Buck said. 'If the president and Washington Democrats want FEMA up and running, they . have the ability to make it happen today.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Obama spoke about hurricane preparedness at FEMA, but aimed barb after barb at Republicans for supposedly harming the emergency management agency in the partial government shutdown . House Speaker John Boehner said Sunday on ABC's 'This Week' that there aren't enough disaffected Republicans in his caucus to help Democrats pass an omnibus funding bill in an up-or-down vote . Continuing to fund . FEMA at 2013 budget levels was part of a GOP-led push to promote a . series of piecemeal resolutions. Taken together, those resolutions are designed to take noncontroversial . funding off the table as the White House dug in its heels on negotiating . over funding for the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature health . insurance overhaul law. 'The president,' White house Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday, 'is ready, willing and eager to sit down with lawmakers,' but only on a larger solution that includes funding for all of government – including Obamacare. Boehner said Sunday on ABC's 'This Week' program that if a so-called 'clean' funding resolution were to receive a vote on the House floor, it would fail. At least 18 Republicans would need to defect from their leadership in order to break the logjam, something Boehner insisted would not happen even as the nation approaches its debt ceiling limit.' 'The votes are not in the . House to pass a clean debt limit [increase],' he said. 'And the president is risking default . by not having a conversation with us.' A White House official said Monday that Boehner should 'prove that a majority in the House would not vote for the Senate-passed bill to reopen the government by holding an up-or-down vote' on funding for everything, 'including FEMA.' 'Why not vote, right?' Carney jabbed from the White House briefing podium. 'We could resolve this ... if he would simply allow this to come to a vote.' White House press secretary Jay Carney joined in the elbow-poking on Monday. 'Why not vote, right?' he jabbed. 'Why play these games? Just open the government' Tropical Storm Karen came with a whimper, not a roar, but president Obama said storm preparations were affected by a scaled-back FEMA in the wake of the government's partial shutdown . 'Why play these games? Just open the government,' Carney zinged. Obama . himself said Monday that 'my very strong suspicion is there are enough . votes there'' to pass the larger funding legislation that the . Democratic-controlled Senate favors. 'Hold a vote,' the president dared Republicans. 'Call a vote right now. Let's see what happens.' But Rep. Tom Graves, a Georgia . Democrat, said in a Fox News interview after Obama spoke that . Republicans wouldn't allow the president to pick off its members one by . one or threaten them into playing the Democrats' game. 'It . would be very dangerous for him to underestimate the resolve of Speaker . Boehner and the unity of the Republican House Conference,' Graves said. 'We are totally unified in protecting the American people and providing them fairness through this process. I hope that's a message the president gets, because we're going to stand firm.' Graves authored the House bill aimed at defunding Obamacare – the measure that started the shutdown fight last month. The GOP, he said of Obama, wants 'Americans to have the same delays from the mandate to sign up for Obamacare that he's provided to businesses and members of Congress, and the exemptions for insurance companies. That's all we're asking for.' Graves added a jab about Obama's FEMA photo-op, saying that 'he really wasn't being forthright with the American people. ... We . passed a clean FEMA bill just last week and the president ordered a veto . threat against that.' 'He issued the veto threat and ordered Harry Reid not to take it up.' Louisiana GOP Rep. Steve Scalise said Friday that the Obama administration should put politics aside and allow Republicans to fund FEMA regardless of the impact on larger negotiations. 'When you've got a storm in the Gulf of Mexico, this is not a time for partisanship,' he said.","Obama complained Monday that hundreds of FEMA employees had been called back to work from their furloughs over the weekend but would be sent home again this week .
However, Republicans and some Democrats voted in the House on Friday to fully fund FEMA, but the White House threatened to veto the proposal .
Senate Democrats blocked the measure from consideration .
White House insists that if Speaker John Boehner held a vote on a 'clean' resolution that funds the government without Obamacare-related strings attached enough Republicans would defect to pass the bill .
The GOP insists that its conference will rally behind Boehner, and that they are unified in their desire to push back Obamacare's individual mandate ."

In the future Arin might consider having genital surgery, but this can be expensive and complicated – for now he’s happy with his body.

Arin's mother, Denise Andrews said: 'Seeing Katie go through her surgery was helpful to Arin. 'It was being around it and seeing her getting to transform. And being a couple at the time was I think just the cherry on the cake. 'Every transgender person would love to have the transformation physically because it just completes them as a person.' Katie's mother, Jazzlyn Hill recalled the moment she knew something was not right with her son. ‘Katie started telling me that he wanted his parts off,’ she told Trisha. The last two years have been very difficult for the teenagers. Katie was bullied at school, and Arin had to change to a different high school when he revealed he was transgender, and has lost friends in the process.

Living life to the fullest: The teenage couple have been bullied and lost friends but have been able to support each other through their gender treatment . 'I lost one of my best friends through the transition,' said Arin. 'We used to go on vacations together and were like sisters. 'But I got the chance to open her eyes and show her I'm still a good person. I'm still the person I was, I just look different. 'She was gone for a while but then she came back. 'It taught me that the people who really love you need some time, but they'll always come back around.' After he began dressing as a boy, Arin also lost a new male friend who learned about his past as a girl. 'He said: ''I pictured you as a girl, and I can't do it anymore,''' said Arin, adding: 'You can't just force people to be your friends.' Defining themselves: Last year Katie had a $35,000 sex change surgery to turn her into a woman - and now Arin has followed his dream to have a flat, male chest following an operation . Young romance: The couple have been together for two years . Katie started her degree course at an . Oklahoma university last autumn but has struggled to make new friends . because of prejudices against transgender people in the traditional . Southern State. She . said: 'I had quite a lot of friends in college that were really close to . me and then all of a sudden they just stopped talking to me. 'I . think what happened is they found out I was trans through a story or . word of mouth and they decided that was too much for them.' The last two years have also been difficult for the teenager's families as they've come to terms with losing their son and daughter, and also some of their own friends. Arin's mum Denise said: 'There are still a group of people we don't interact with any more. I know that they questioned me as a parent, they're not comfortable with it.' Graduating grin: Katie, pictured with her mother Jazzlyn, is the first openly transgender teen to graduate from a high school in Oklahoma . But she added: 'A lot of people worry about losing the gender of their child. But as you look through albums and realise your babies are growing up, we also watched them grow up and turn into somebody different. 'Whether they stay the same gender or not, they become independent.' Now their outward transformation is complete, the teenagers hope people will accept them as their new genders, and their difficulties will become a thing of the past. 'More needs to be done to let people know about transgender issues,' Katie in a previous interview. 'We both spent years in the wilderness and felt so alone. Nobody should have to go through what we did.'","Katie Hill, 19, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, was previously called Luke and underwent sex-change surgery last year .

Patients with existing heart problems are most at risk as the drugs can trigger a dangerous rise in chemicals linked to heart disease . Common indigestion drugs used by millions of Britons could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, according to research. Scientists said the drugs, called proton pump inhibitors, can trigger a dangerous rise in chemicals in the body linked with heart disease. Patients with existing heart problems, such as angina, are at most risk, but healthy adults with no history of such complaints could also be affected, the researchers said. The number of prescriptions for PPIs such as lansoprazole and omeprazole – sold over the counter as Zanprol - has doubled in recent years to more than eight million a year, costing the NHS around £400million a year. The exact number of patients on the drugs is not known because some buy them over the counter at high street chemists. PPIs work by blocking the action of cells called proton pumps, which produce stomach acid. Although very effective, they should only be used for a maximum of two months and preferably for between two and four weeks. But many patients quickly find they cannot live without them and ask for repeat prescriptions from their GP or buy them at the chemist. Previous studies identified a potential link between the drugs and heart problems, although scientists conceded there was no obvious explanation for the connection. Now experts at the Methodist Hospital Research Institute in Houston, Texas, believe they have uncovered the reason why. After studying samples of human heart tissue, as well as carrying out experiments on mice, they found that PPIs triggered an increase in a chemical called asymmetric dimethylarginine, or ADMA, produced as the body’s cells make proteins. It can hinder blood flow by blocking the release of nitric oxide, a gas which helps arteries to stay flexible and healthy. The drugs are prescribed to be used for a maximum of two months but many patients find them hard to live without and buy more over the counter . The latest findings, published in the . journal Circulation, show PPI medicines increase ADMA levels by about 25 . per cent and reduce the ability of blood vessel walls to relax by more . than 30 per cent. In a report on their findings, the researchers said: ‘Several studies have raised concern that the use of PPIs in patients with acute coronary syndrome [heart disease] may increase their risk of major adverse events. ‘We found a plausible biological mechanism to explain this.’ Research leader Dr John Cooke said: ‘This surprising effect needs further investigation.’ The same drugs have also been found to increase the dangers of osteoporosis.","Drugs can trigger rise in chemicals that are linked with heart disease .

Catured: U.S. officials have not confirmed the capture of Anas al-Libi, but his family has said he was captured from in front of his home by armed commandos . The three-vehicle ambush that resulted in the Saturday kidnapping from Tripoli of a Libyan terrorist accused of planning the bombings of multiple United States Embassies was the culmination of an international manhunt spanning three decades. Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, known more commonly as Anas al-Libi, is said by US officials to be the mastermind behind the Aug 7, 1998, twin bombings of United States Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya. The terrorist has long been on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s most-wanted list, with a sky-high $5million bounty for his head.His capture is a significant victory for the United States in its war on terror. Hunted by the US since being identified as the planner of the twin bombings, al-Libi had publicly renounced violence in the years after the terror attacks and turned to computer programming. The wanted man had even been granted political asylum in Britain. Captured while parking a car outside his home in the Libyan capital, Mr al-Libi, 49. Is believed to have returned to Libya in 2011 at the request of one of Dictator Moammar Gadhafi’s sons. The desperate despot had begun trying to further consolidate power during the beginning days of the Arab Spring through reconciliation with militants who renounced violence. Scroll down for video . Coordinated: Anas al-Libi was one of the planners of both the US Embassy in Tanzania bombing (pictured here) and the US Embassy in Kenya bombing . Lethal: Over 200 people were killed in the twin 1998 attacks, with 11 dead in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (pictured here with then-US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright touring the bombed-out site) Mr al-Libi’s son died a year after the family returned to Tripoli, in a firefight  during the 2011 civil was that resulted in the ouster and execution of Mr Gadhafi. Though said to be tied to the terror organization decades after engineering two of its most successful attacks to that point, it’s not clear exactly what his role was within the organization. He is characterized by US officials as a senior member. The coordinated twin bombings went off within minutes of each other on either side of 10:30am local time, killing 213 in Nairobi and 11 in Dar es Salaam. Well over 1,000 people were reported injured, according to the FBI. Devastating: Over 200 people alone were killed in the bombing of the US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya (pictured here) Horrific event: Volunteers and rescue workers remove bodies of the over 1,000 injured in the attack on the US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya . Catastrophic: This is what remained of one of the buildings in the US Embassy complex in Nairobi, Kenya after the 1998 bombings . The bombings were the first to bring the al-Qaeda terror group’s name into American households.Mr al-Libi was indicted in court for the attacks in the Southern District of New York. Though the charges still stand, it is unclear if he will face a domestic trial for the attacks. The Tripoli University graduate, an expert on electronic and nuclear engineering, was granted asylum in Britain in 1995 after fleeing Sudan. It is not clear how he was granted asylum. Mr al-Libi lived in Manchester until being added to the FBI’s most wanted list in 2000. Though rumored to have been held in a secret CIA prison, the wanted man did not surface until 2011, when he returned to Libya after decades away.","Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, known more commonly as Anas al-Libi, was captured in broad daylight from a Tripoli street .

The heartbroken family of a pregnant mother mysteriously shot to death as she drove home six weeks ago are still desperately searching for answers. Brittany Stykes, 22, was shot in the neck and through the chest as she drove in Bethel, Ohio with her 14-month-old daughter Aubree inside the car and crashed the vehicle into a wooded area. When a passerby spotted her yellow Jeep, he discovered her and her unborn child dead inside and her toddler daughter crying for her mother, covered in blood. Aubree had been shot once in the head but is recovering after multiple surgeries. Six weeks on and police are still . trying to figure out where the shots came from and why anyone would want . to hurt the caring church-goer and happily married mother. Tragic: Brittany Stykes, 22, was shot and killed, while her daughter Aubree, left, was shot in the head as they drove home on August 28. Police still do not know who shot the bullets or where they came from . 'We were looking forward to . everything,' her devastated husband Shane told the Cincinnati Enquirer. 'She was my everything, my world.' The married stay-at-home mother was four months pregnant and her unborn child also died in the tragedy on August 28. Five bullets hit the car through the driver's side, authorities said. Autopsy results show that no gunpowder . residue was found on Stykes' body, which suggests that the shots weren't . fired at close range. 'We do not have enough to say right now that this was random. Was she targeted? We don't know,' Detective Sgt. Moore said. On the mend: Aubree, pictured with her father Shane, has undergone three surgeries and needs another .

She did not have life insurance, family members said, and police said Shane, Brittany's ex-boyfriend and a third person all passed a polygraph test. Police added that Shane's alibi - that he was working out a small gym with at least three police officers present - was solid. Police added that there were no domestic . calls to the Stykes' home and Brittany's parents said she had been . happily married to Shane since 2012, and loved his children, aged six . and 14, like her own. Shane said he had no idea who would want to hurt his wife. Scene: Trucks tow Brittany's yellow Jeep, right, which was found crashed off the highway on August 28 .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 14:20 EST, 5 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:14 EST, 6 October 2013 . Education officials in the nation's second-largest school district are working to reboot a $1 billion plan to put an iPad in the hands of each of their 650,000 students after an embarrassing glitch emerged when the first round of tablets went out. Instead of solving math problems or doing English homework, as administrators envisioned, more than 300 Los Angeles Unified School District students promptly cracked the security settings and started tweeting, posting to Facebook and playing video games. '`Temple Run.' `Subway Surfing.' Oh, and some car racing game I can't remember the name of,' said freshman Stephany Romero, laughing as she described the games she saw fellow Roosevelt High School students playing in class last week. Rollout on pause: The tampered iPads could access unauthorized websites and apps, such as Facebook, YouTube, and Pandora. Workers at the Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD) have started confiscating iPads that bypassed the devices' security measures . That incident, and related problems, had both critics and supporters questioning this week whether LAUSD officials were being hasty or overreaching in their attempt to distribute an iPad to every student and teacher at the district's more than 1,000 campuses by next year. 'It doesn't seem like there was much planning that went into this strategy,' said Renee Hobbs, director of the Harrington School of Communication and Media at the University of Rhode Island. 'That's where the debacle began.' It's crucial, she said, to spend extensive time drawing students into a discussion on using iPads responsibly before handing them out. And, of course, installing a firewall that can't be easily breached. At Roosevelt High, it was the unanimous opinion of more than a dozen students that the school district's security setup was so weak that even the most tech-challenged parent could have gotten past it. Stealing students: Despite the disappearance of 71 iPads so far, 640,000 students in California will eventually receive free Apple tablets for educational purposes. 'It was so easy!' said freshman Carlos Espinoza. He explained that all one needed to do was access the tablet's settings, delete the profile established by the school district and set up an Internet connection. He did it, he said, because he wanted to go on Facebook. 'They kind of should have known this would happen,' said Espinoza's friend Maria Aguilera. 'We're high school students after all. I mean, come on,' she added. Golden deal: The Los Angeles Unified School District embarked on a $1 billion initiative to place an iPad in the hands of each of the more than 600,000 students in the nation's second largest school district . As word spread, with the speed of a microprocessor, that anyone could crack the firewall, officials quickly confiscated the devices and put a freeze on using them off campus. In the meantime, they promised to improve the security settings. When they started distributing the iPads at 47 district schools in August, administrators touted the move as a means of leveling the academic playing field in a public school system where 80 percent of the students come from low-income families. Now, they said, everyone would have equal access to the most cutting-edge educational software programs, not just the children of parents with deep pockets. But after the first shot in that digital revolution led to a flood of tweets, other concerns arose. Among them: . - Who pays if a kid drops one of these $678 gadgets into a toilet or leaves it on a bus? - Is it realistic to tell a student she can use it to do her homework, then not allow the device to connect to the Internet from home? (Schools will be wired.) - And since the tablet without Web access is only as good as the educational software placed on it, how good is that software? A parent, Scott Folsom, said he heard from one source that families would have to pay for broken iPads and from another that the school would. District officials have said there was confusion over that issue but that it's been decided schools will cover the cost of an iPad accidentally broken, lost or stolen, while families are on the hook for one negligently damaged. Of more serious concern to Folsom is the software. He sampled one of the new iPads, he said, and found no program to adequately support English-as-a-second-language students. That would seemingly be crucial for a district whose students are 73 percent Hispanic and where only 14 percent of English learners can speak the language fluently, according to a 2011 Department of Education study. As a parent representative to the district's bond oversight committee, Folsom voted to recommend spending $30 million last June to buy the first batch of iPads. He says he still supports the program but worries that maybe educators are trying to implement it too quickly. 'This is the future,' he said. 'But whether LAUSD is stepping too quickly into the future - based on the fact that it's so big, and we seem to be in such a hurry - those are questions to consider.' Although the scheme to distribute iPads is well intentioned, at least 71 iPads went missing last year from the Los Angeles Unified School District. The lost devices, worth a total of just over $48k, are among the iPads used in a 13-school trial run of a $1 billion program designed to improve education. . The bulk of the 71 missing devices worth $678 each, disappeared from one school called Valley Academy of Arts and Sciences in Granada Hills, California. Approximately 1,200 iPads were distributed to the school last year. By year's end, 69 were unaccounted for .","LA school system will spend $1b on program that supplies nation's second-largest school system with free iPads .

Tragedy: Dr Thomas McAfee died after stumbling and being trampled to death by an elephant while on safari in Tanzania . An American doctor has died in terrifying circumstances while on a luxury safari in Africa after being trampled to death by a charging elephant on Saturday. Sources with knowledge of the incident have confirmed to the MailOnline that Thomas McAfee, 58, a dean at University of California was in Tarangire National Park in Tanzania on vacation before starting a new position as chief executive of the Keck Medicine of USC Medical Foundation. McAfee's body is still in the east African nation and his family have been informed of the tragedy as they wait for a death certificate to be issued. There is no word yet on when his body will be flown back to the United States and details are scarce as to the exact circumstances surrounding his shocking death. Elephants are known to make unprovoked attacks on people, but more often they react when they feel that their family is threatened or cornered. As the world's largest land animal weighing up to 15,000 pounds, a charging elephant is a frightening and deadly force to be reckoned with. According to Debra Kain, director of Health Sciences Research Communications at UC San Diego, the death has come as a huge unexpected shock. Well traveled: Dr. McAfee, who died on Saturday, had been due to start work as the CEO of the Keck Medicine of USC Medical Foundation this week. Here he is pictured in Brazil . In an email sent to NBC San Diego, Mounir Soliman, assistant vice chancellor and executive director of Health Sciences International said, 'It's a true tragedy and great loss to all of us at UCSD. We are planning several events in celebration of Dr. McAfee's life.' Tarangire National Park is the sixth largest national park in Tanzania and covers 1,100 square miles and is home to 550 species including the giraffe, zebra and is noted for the famous termite mounds that dot the landscape. A luxury safari in the park with accommodation at one of the top lodges in the area can cost up to $1,000 a night.

Fearsome: An elephant bull (not the same elephant that attacked Dr. McAfee) swinging his trunk and running to charge . In a varied career at UC San Diego, McAfee was the dean of Clinical Affairs for the UC San Diego Health Sciences, as well as chief executive officer for UC San Diego Faculty Practice. According his online biography, McAfee joined UCSD Health Sciences in 2002 as their physician-in-chief. His former colleages at UC San Diego, David Brenner, MD, Paul Viviano and Larry Friedman, MD, released the following email on Sunday to staff. 'It is with regret and personal sadness that we inform you that Dr. Thomas McAfee, until very recently, the Dean of Clinical Affairs for UC San Diego Health Sciences and CEO for UC San Diego Faculty Practice, was killed in an accident while on vacation in Africa. We have no other details at present,' reads the email. 'Dr. McAfee served us and worked alongside us for more than 11 years, and his death is a great loss – both to many of us personally, and to the field of health care which would have benefited enormously from his talent and dedication in coming years. 'Dr. McAfee was adventurous in spirit, loved to visit new places and to meet new people. A celebration of his life will be held in coming weeks for the Health Sciences community.' University of California San Diego: McAfee¿s last day with UC San Diego was fairly recent . On Tuesday he was to have begun as CEO of the newly formed Keck Medicine of USC Medical Foundation.

Vote No: Alastair Darling, pictured at the 'Better Together' campaign launch today in Scotland, is leading the fight to keep the Union . A vote for independence is like buying Scotland's children a one-way ticket to uncertainty, Alastair Darling claimed as he launched the pro-Union campaign today. Scotland 'has a better future' if the United Kingdom is not broken up, the former Labour Chancellor said as he began the fight to block it. The Scottish will probably go to the polls in 2014 to decide whether the country should leave the UK. 'The choice we make will be irrevocable,' Mr Darling told campaigners this morning at Edinburgh Napier University's egg-shaped lecture hall in . Craiglockhart. 'If we decide to leave the United Kingdom there is no way back. It is . like asking us to buy a one-way ticket to send our children to a deeply . uncertain destination.' The 'Better Together' campaign he leads has brought in big-hitting media strategists Blue State Digital, which helped bring US President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande to power. They will also distribute half a million leaflets promoting the social union between the two nations. The leaflets highlight the one in five workers employed by English firms in Scotland, as well as those working for the UK Government in places such as the Department for International Development offices in East Kilbride. Another points to the 800,000 Scots who live and work in England and Wales 'without the need for papers or passports'. Mr Darling, echoing the message of the campaign's advertising campaign, argued that Scotland can have the best of both worlds without breaking the Union. Scroll down to hear the speech . Happy: Former chancellor Alistair Darling, right, during the launch of the formal campaign to keep Scotland in the UK . Campaigning: Alistair Darling, second left, during today's launch at Edinburgh's Napier University . 'A strong Scottish Parliament and a key role in a strong and secure United Kingdom,' he said. 'I believe we can cement Scotland's place in the United Kingdom once and . for all and then get on with building the Scotland we want and . deserve.' The rival campaign to break up the UK was launched a month ago by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond where he urged one million Scots to sign up to a ‘declaration of independence’. Mr Darling's speech was followed by a . film showing Scots explaining why they are comfortable being patriotic . while keeping the country in the UK. Students, pensioners and workers all gave their views that it can be positive to vote No in the ballot. They . described family and historic ties, saying Scotland is stronger as part . of a wider Union including England, Wales and Northern Ireland. YES: Alex Salmond launched his YES campaign last month, with celebrity supporters including actors Alan Cumming and Brian Cox . It was in contrast to the celebrity-endorsed launch of the Yes Scotland campaign which hopes to secure independence in 2014. Former Scottish Conservative leader Annabel Goldie, introducing the 'real people', including a teacher from Inverness, a retired soldier, a young farmer from the Scottish Borders and an Englishman who said he is happy to make Scotland his adopted home. Miss Goldie was joined on stage by Kezia Dugdale, a Labour MSP, who spoke to shipbuilders committed to a No vote. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie closed the campaign launch with a call to everyone who wishes Scotland to remain in the UK. People should ask themselves every day how they can play a part in beating the 'passionate' pro-independence movement, he said. 'We'll take nothing for granted. In the campaign to keep our family together, we will work for every single vote,' he said. Celebrity backing: Actor Alan Cumming endorsed the independence campaign at the launch . The rabble-rousing campaign to overturn the 305-year-old Act of Union is led by the Scottish Nationalists and backed by the Scottish Socialists and Greens. But Mr Salmond's launch was overshadowed by blunders when it emerged that three of the celebrities backing the ‘yes’ campaign may not be allowed to vote in an independence referendum. The SNP’s star backer, the Bahamas-based actor Sir Sean Connery, disappointed campaigners by failing to show up, sending just a message of support. GoldenEye actor Alan Cumming and Braveheart star Brian Cox were instead left to take to the stage, yet neither of the Hollywood idols lives in Scotland. At the launch of the campaign in an Edinburgh cinema, Mr Salmond said: ‘We unite behind a declaration of self-evident truth. Rivals: David Cameron, pictured with Alex Salmond, is one of many leading politicians who are campaigning to keep Scotland part of the UK . ‘The people who live in Scotland are best placed to make the decisions that affect Scotland. 'We want a Scotland that’s greener, that’s fairer and more prosperous. 'We realise that the power of an independent Scotland is necessary to achieve these great ends.' Meanwhile it was revealed the majority of English and Welsh people want to save the Union and prevent Scotland becoming independent. Only one in three asked by pollsters said they would be happy if their northern neighbours left the United Kingdom. A survey by The Independent asked whether Scotland should be separate and independent, and two out of three said no. Its result flies in the face of claims that most English and Welsh would be happy not to 'subsidise' Scotland, as some critics have claimed happens. ComRes said when asked if they agreed Scotland should be separate from the rest of the UK and become independent, 28 per cent agreed, 57 per cent disagreed and 15 per cent didn't know.","The former Labour Chancellor today launched 'Better Together', the pro-Union campaign .

Jane, who now weighs a healthy 11st 9lb, said: 'I had been engaged to Andy for 12 years, but I kept putting off setting a date because I didn’t want to look big on my wedding day. 'I used to eat things like chocolate and custard tarts in secret. 'People referred to me as the Big One or Big Jane and although I was only really teased as a teenager I knew I had to lose weight, especially for my wedding. 'I joined Slimming World in January 2011, I lost about six stone in the first year and three months ago I finally got married. 'I felt amazing on my wedding day and it was great that I could fit into my dream dress. 'It wanted this particular type of dress but I was never going to be able to wear something like that the size I was.'

Jane said: 'I have the confidence and the figure to wear more dresses and it feels amazing to be able to do so' 'Getting in to your typical tight wedding dress was what my ultimate goal was. That really my main focus. Jane at the Kidsgrove branch of Slimming World in August 2013 . 'I never wore dresses as I was quite tomboyish when I was large - I just lived in jeans and T-shirts all the time. 'It was amazing really - I worked really hard and the first dress I was ever able to wear turned out to be my wedding dress.' Jane said she was also forced into action when she got a new job as an IT trainer at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. And she says losing the weight has since brought out her inner girl and means she enjoys clothes shopping for the first time. Jane, from Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, added: 'The wedding was the key one that kept me going but there was also my job, which I had only been doing for six months. 'It was a job where I was very mobile rather than sat at a desk and I found it difficult to be on my feet all day. 'I was standing up in front of people training them and it made me very body conscious - especially in front of doctors and nurses. I felt as if they were judging me. 'People who have known me forever said the wedding has brought out my inner girl. 'Now I enjoy buying clothes and getting my hair done but before when I was big I would never buy anything that would be feminine.

Jack Dorsey is widely known the founder of Twitter but a new book has revealed that it was his friend that he later pushed out of the company who helped take Dorsey's germ of an idea and turn it into a reality. Dorsey wasn't even the one who came up with the name of the social media site, and it was his friend Noah Glass who should be credited with the moniker. Glass reportedly spent days flipping through a dictionary looking for inspiration before making a mental connection between the vibration of a phone, to a twitch, to twitter. The story of how Glass helped develop the new status-updating service and taking ownership of the idea before Dorsey allegedly made a power play and got their third partner- Evan Williams- to fire him is all detailed in a New York Times preview of an upcoming book, called Hatching Twitter. Plotting: A new book tells how Jack Dorsey (seen here in September) pushed his friend and Twitter co-founder Noah Glass out of the company because he felt threatened . 'I was not in the story, which in some ways was difficult to deal with in the beginning, since it was a massive labor of love and a massive labor to get it created,' Glass told Business Insider in an exclusive interview. 'To create the thing, to bring it into the world. It was a ton of effort and a ton of energy. Man left behind: Noah Glass was part of the team that came up with Twitter but then ousted from the company . The 'he said, he said' account of who really came up with the idea adds Twitter to the growing list of boldfaced company names whose creation is plagued by ego trips and PR moves. Dorsey was a 29-year-old college dropout who couldn't get a job as a shoe salesman when he sent Evan Williams his resume to see if he had a job for him. Williams was four years older than Dorsey and made a name for himself in Silicon Valley by selling Blogger to Google for millions of dollars. At the time, Williams and his neighbor and fellow college dropout Noah Glass were running a new company called Odeo that was focusing on producing podcasts. Author Nick Bilton tells how Odeo was . floundering because their service was made slightly irrelevant once . iTunes began streaming podcasts, so they began turning to their . engineers and other employees for new possible ventures. Dorsey . and Williams, who were good friends both in and out of the office, . reportedly started talking seriously about the idea for a . status-updating site after a night of heavy drinking. 'There . was a moment when I was sitting with Jack and I said, ""Oh, I do see how . this could really come together to make something really compelling."" We were sitting on Mission St. in the car in the rain. We were going out . and I was dropping him off and having this conversation. There was a . moment where it all fit together for me,' Glass said. The . late night conversation in 2006 turned into a reality and Williams got . on board, involving the board of Odeo and pursuing a number of venture . capital funders. Big name: Dorsey originally approached Evan Williams (pictured) about getting a job at the old company he used to run with Glass called Odeo. Williams was famous in the tech world at that point for selling Blogger to Google for millions . Public face: Dorsey has made a concerted effort to portray himself as the sole founder of the company and accepts many interview opportunities as they are a chance to brand himself and the company . The lengthy book excerpt tells how there were growing pains throughout the multi-year formation leading right up to the recent announcement that they are looking for a billion dollar IPO launch. One of the biggest problems that hindered their rapid growth was Dorsey's lack of management skills. He allegedly regularly left the office by 6pm to make it in time for hot yoga lessons and a fashion design course that he was taking at a local school. Williams eventually sat him down and gave him an ultimatum: 'You can either be a dressmaker or the C.E.O. of Twitter, but you can’t be both.' Much like Steve Jobs before him who was ousted from Apple before re-joining the company, Dorsey was asked to leave so that Williams, who was a stronger manager, could become CEO. Dorsey didn't take the news well and spoke to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg about coming to work for the competing social media giant. Makeover: Dorsey used to have a nose ring but changed his look once being appointed CEO . In the end, there was no clear role for Dorsey, though Facebook was happy to bring him on board and iron out the details later. Dorsey ended up leaving that be and creating his mobile payment program, Square. Dorsey later re-joined Twitter and is largely seen as the public face of the company- much to his own credit as he has given plenty of interviews telling about how he came up with the idea for the massive company. 'While Dorsey had the germ of the idea, without the collaboration of the people who worked at Odeo, that idea would have remained just an idea,' Bilton writes. Dorsey never mentioned Glass in interviews and Glass' stock holdings means that he will likely only make the same amount as Dorsey's secretary made through Square. By comparison, Dorsey stands to make $2billion, and Williams could bring home $8billion. 'I haven't spoken with him in 5 years. He has his own ideas about how life works,' Glass told Business Insider.","Jack Dorsey is largely seen as the founder of Twitter but a new book tells about how he came up with the idea with a friend .

Now Glass will make a percentage of what Dorsey and Williams will make once Twitter's IPO is set and the company goes public ."

"By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 11:40 EST, 14 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:53 EST, 14 March 2013 . The Kardashian's debut cosmetics line has been pulled from stores following a court order. Kim, Kourtney and Khloe announced their range, Khroma Beauty, last year and they were planning to roll-out it out at more than 5,000 retailers across the U.S. this month. But the trio have been stopped from distributing their beauty products, as a Florida-based company called Kroma Makeup is suing their licensing partner for 'stealing' its name. Not as smart as she thinks? Kim Kardashian 'came up' with the name of the Khroma line but is now being sued . The firm's owner Lee Tillett . trademarked the Kroma name back in 2010 and she sent a cease-and-desist . letter to Boldface, the company that produces the Kardashian-fronted . Khroma line, when the range was launched. Miss Tillett sought $10m (£6.67m) in damages from the sisters and Boldface Group Inc for 'stealing' the name of her cosmetics line. She claimed that the girl's . company, for which they were guaranteed to make at least $6.2 million, . would cause confusion in the marketplace. And it seems like the judge on the . case agrees, according to Law360: 'Tillett has demonstrated that [she] . will likely lose business opportunities, customers and goodwill due to . Boldface’s use of the confusingly similar Khroma Beauty marks,' said . U.S. District Judge Audrey B. Collins in her ruling. 'The court has little doubt that, in . short order, the Khroma Beauty products will likely eliminate Tillett’s . business entirely, creating irreparable harm sufficient to justify an . injunction.' Triple threat: Each of the sisters has products in the line and they are all being sued . While this injunction is preliminary at this point (non effective yet) and could be postponed if Boldface appeals the decision, the future . isn't looking great for the famous sisters. Tillett first raised the issue with the girls in July 2012 when she claimed it infringed on her Kroma Make-up line, which she founded back in 2004. Florida native Miss Tillett told the Orlando Sentinel: . 'I developed the Kroma line myself, built my business through my own . hard work, and took the legal steps necessary to protect it. 'And . yet I have now been forced into legal battle with the Kardashians . simply because they have decided to take something that doesn't belong . to them.' Ongoing: Tillett first raised the issue with the girls in July 2012 when she claimed it infringed on her Kroma Make-up line, which she founded back in 2004 . On the Kroma website it states the word means colour in Greek, but adds how Miss Tillett used her 22 . years (experience) of creating looks for thousands of women' and . 'personally selected all of the shades and has personally made all of . the formulas.' And in her formal federal court response she claims the promotion of Khroma was likely to mislead customers into thinking her line is associated with the Kardashian sisters. She added: 'The false association is damaging … and threatens to destroy its business.' According to the counter-claims, Boldface has paid the Kardashians an upfront advance of $1m for licensing rights, with guaranteed minimum royalty payments of $4.6 (£3.07) million to $5.2 (£3.47) million, depending on launch dates of various products. As part of the deal, they allegedly have some power over the product line and that Kim 'proposed' it be called Khroma. Miss Tillett's attorney Elliot Gipson claims the 32-year-old should have known better. Friends in high places: Lee Tillett with Days of Our Lives star Deidre Hall at the Emmy Awards . He pointed to discussions by representatives for himself and TLK Fusion, which allegedly acted as Kardashian's product-placement agent for a show that was being produced by Kim. He said: 'On or about May 2010, representatives for Tillett and TLK Fusion were engaged in discussions regarding the possible product placement of the KROMA cosmetics line on the television reality show special The SPINdustry that was scheduled to air on E! Entertainment Television following an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.' No deal was ever reached, but if this is true she could have had advance knowledge that the name was already in use. Kardashian spokesman Todd Wilson claims the sisters 'have acted properly at all times'. This is not the only lawsuit the product line is engulfed in at the moment. Los Angeles-based Chroma Makeup Studio is also suing for alleged trademark infringement.","Lee Tillett who trademarked Kroma in 2010, is suing Boldface, the company that produces the Kardashian-fronted Khroma line .

Many people covet a celebrity body but one woman was shocked rather than flattered when she was likened to Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus. Being told she was the spitting image of the singer gave Katie Lawton, 22, from Stoke-on-Trent, the motivation she needed to lose weight. Her step-sister, Stacey Wisdom, also from Stoke-on-Trent, agreed to join her on her weightloss programme and between them they shed 12 stone. Slimming sisters: Katie Lawton (L) and Stacey Wisdom lost twelve stone between them after Katie was compared to Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus . Katie, who tipped the scales at just over 19 stone and struggled to squeeze into a size 20 dress, and size 16 Stacey, who weighed almost 13 stone, decided to diet after Katie was compared to the overweight singer. Katie said: 'I was walking along Blackpool Pier when one of the stall holders tried to get me to play a game. One of the prizes was a Michelle McManus CD, and he said that I looked like her. 'It was just very embarrassing. I couldn't believe he would say something like that.' When Katie returned home and recalled the incident to her step-sister, the pair realised it was time to make a change. Stacey, 31, said: 'After Katie told me what happened, we went online to look at pictures of Michelle. 'It was a shock to both of us and I think it did trigger something - we signed up to Weight Watchers. 'I’m . sure that small minded man in Blackpool has never thought about what he . said since, but now we can look back at him and be proud of how far . we’ve come. People need to be aware that small minded comments like that can really hurt.'

'She'd remind me how much weight I'd already lost and how far I'd come. 'As she had less weight to lose she reached her goal first, so it was an inspiration for me. I knew that if she could do it, then so could I.' Stacey agrees, adding: 'I lost the weight quicker, but I needed Katie to help me maintain it. 'Because she was still going to the meetings it meant I did too. I'd have probably put it all back on if it wasn't for her.'

The evening before the incident, in March last year, Crook had to be treated by medics after drinking a 'considerable quantity of vodka', his court martial hearing was told. The next day his unit left a checkpoint in the Nad e Ali district of the Helmand Province to go on patrol. Crook followed, arming himself with two grenades and a bayonet because his rifle had been confiscated as a safety measure. He came across two Afghans riding bikes - one of them was Ghulam, who had been sent out to collect a bottle of yoghurt. Disgraced: Daniel Crook was dismissed from the Grenadier Guards.

He wowed us all with his spectacular dives alongside Tom Daley at last summer's Olympics and is the most successful diver in British Olympic history. Yet despite his achievements over an impressive four Olympic games, Peter Waterfield has always had an image problem. With a strong Cockney accent and a head he has shaved since he started losing his hair as a teenager - he admits that many people mistook him for a 'thug.' He badly wanted to soften his image and decided the obvious solution was a hair transplant. Peter (left) with his diving partner Tom Daley. He said he felt his baldness make him 'look like a thug' Peter, 31, has a strong baldness gene in his family and both his brothers have lost their hair. The father-of-two said: 'I started going bald when I was 18 which is when I got really serious about diving, although I've been told this had nothing to do with it. 'I had completely lost my hairline and the only way to cover it up was by shaving my head. 'I come from the East End of London and I would find that people could . sometimes be intimidated by my Cockney accent and my shaved head. 'I think some people wrongly got the impression that I was a bit of a thug – which could not be further from the truth. 'I am a loving family man and have dedicated my life to diving and helping others.' Peter before the treatment. The purple line marks where the hair would be transplanted . Peter after the treatment, which involved moving 4,200 hairs from the back of his head to the top of his scalp to restore his hairline . The silver medallist lives in Southampton with his wife Tania, 30, and sons Lewis, 11, and Marshall, four. He . added:  'I wanted to soften my whole image and make sure that I was a . little more approachable to strangers. The best way to do that was by . having a hair transplant.' Peter had approximately 4,200 hairs moved from the back of his head to . the top of his scalp to restore his hairline at the Crown Clinic in . Manchester. Commonwealth Games gold medallist Peter had the same Follicle Unit . Extraction procedure as Wayne Rooney. During the procedure last month, around 1,500 grafts were transplanted to his hairline and a further . 1,000 were transplanted to bolster his hair at the top of his scalp. It will take around a year for the full benefits of the procedure to show as the transplanted hair grows back. There has been 25 per cent rise in the number of men having hair transplants in . the last five years as the technology improves and high-profile stars . such as Wayne Rooney and the Cold Feet actor James Nesbitt have gone public to . show the benefits of the procedures. Top tresses: Wayne Rooney famously spent a staggering £30,000 in his quest to get the perfect head of hair . The procedure was carried out by hair transplant surgeon Asim Shahmalak. He has performed similar procedures on a string of . celebrities including Dr Christian Jessen from Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies and . the model and TV presenter Calum Best. Dr Shahmalak said: 'There are seven categories of male pattern baldness. Category one indicates no hair loss and seven is total hair loss. 'Peter ranked as a 5A – indicating substantial hair loss due to his family history.  Like a lot of the men I have treated, he found that the . transplant significantly boosted his self-esteem. 'He looks and feels a lot younger, too.  There is no doubt that a hair transplant can completely transform a man’s life.' Peter said: 'I am so glad that I had it done – I feel so much more confident now. I am really looking forward to being able to grow my hair for the first time since I was a teenager and present a new image of myself to the world.' He is now Peter is looking forward to competing in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014 with Tom Daley, despite uncertainty over his funding. He said: 'We are both really excited about the Commonwealth Games, and hopefully I can also go on and compete at a fifth Olympics in Brazil in 2016.' Dr Shahmalak from the Crown Clinic in . Manchester, said: Hair transplantation is the only method . that is guaranteed to overcome hair loss and regain hair. Medications . can halt hair loss but they will not lead to the regrowth of lost hair. There are many types of hair transplant. In both . cases, transplantation can be done so well that often a barber or . stylist cannot even tell that grafts have been placed. The transplanted hair is permanent and in nearly all cases will stay in place for the rest of the patient’s life. The most popular and cost-effective . method is called Follicular Unit Transplantation – popularly known as . ‘strip harvesting’  - where hair follicles are removed in a ‘strip’ of skin from . the back or side of the head and moved to the thinning areas at the top . of the scalp. The second technique  - and the one Peter Waterfield had - is called . Follicular Unit Extraction. It is more expensive than strip . harvesting and is the procedure which was used on Wayne Rooney when he had his transplant . in 2011. The main difference is the hairs follicles are removed and transplanted individually as opposed to in one single strip. It is more time consuming – and . therefore more expensive – than strip harvesting. This method is . particularly popular with men who like to keep their hair short because there is virtually no scarring. In Follicular Unit Extraction, or FUE, . individual follicles are extracted directly from the back or side of . scalp, usually one at a time. There will be some minor scarring – which looks like pin . pricks  – immediately after the operation but this  disappears during . the healing process which takes approximately 5-7 days after which any . redness or slight swelling in the treatment area will have subsided. FUE generally has a quicker patient recovery time and lower post-operative discomfort than strip harvesting.","Waterfield, 31, says that with his Cockney accent and shaved head, people often mistook him for a thug .

Councillor Collin Brewer's remarks were described as 'depraved' but he initially refused to quit . A councillor has finally quit his post after causing outrage for his 'depraved' remark in which he suggested 'disabled children cost the council too much money and should be put down'. Collin Brewer, 68, an independent councillor at Cornwall council, had initially remained defiant and refused to stand down. Despite announcing his resignation, . however, he has indicated that he might still consider standing for . re-election when voters in Cornwall go to the polls. Mr Brewer had just emerged from a council meeting when he walked up to a stall set up in county hall run by the Disability Cornwall charity. He claimed he made the comment to 'provoke a reaction' but also said he said it while 'het up' and 'hot under the collar'. Colin Brewer said: 'I know people will be delighted that I have resigned. 'I have tried to explain what I have done over the last 27 years and that this is my first indiscretion, not that there is an excuse for that.' He said he had received many calls to his home in Wadebridge, North Cornwall, since the furore started. He said: 'Most are sympathetic to me, those that I have spoken to. All the councillors that have rung me, at least half a dozen asked me not to resign, to stick in there. 'They know what I am, they know what I am like, they found it strange that I made this remark. This is against my character, they are supportive of me.' Disability Cornwall said it had received messages of support from across the world. In a statement the charity said: 'We believe Councillor Brewer’s decision to step down is the right one. 'It is a shame that it took a formal investigation and 18 months to force the apology we eventually received. 'While Councillor Brewer’s actions are not reflective of the vast majority of councillors, we hope that Cornwall Council will recognise the need for training and awareness-raising for all councillors, staff and departments.' He initially remained defiant yesterday saying he did not thinking it was 'something I would consider resigning over' adding 'I believe I am doing a good job.' He was reported to the council's monitoring officer and it was only when he was told to apologise that he did so - 18 months after making the remark. Katie Price tweeted her disgust at Mr Brewer's comments . Mr Brewer's apology letter in which he acknowledges his comments were 'ill-judged and insensitive' His . apology was sent to Theresa Court, advice services manager at . Disability Cornwall, but she described the note he sent as 'offensive.' Before he resigned she said: 'I couldn't believe it. It's taken a year and a half for him to be told that he has to write an . apology. The apology was an insult. 'It . came with a second class stamp and it was folded up into eight small . bits. He might as well have screwed it up. I can't believe that the only . thing he has had to to is write an apology.He needs to re-think his . job.' Speaking . about the incident she said: 'I was absolutely horrified anyone would . make such a depraved comment, let alone a Cornwall councillor at a . public event. 'As far as I was concerned, I had a duty to make a formal complaint against Councillor Brewer to seek appropriate justice.' Her . charity had a stand at an information event in Truro in October 2011. She was on hand to tell councillors about the issues they face and the . work they do with parents of children with special needs. Theresa Court, who Mr Brewer made the comment to, said she was unhappy with the apology which 'might as well have been screwed up' and came in an envelope with a second class stamp . Mr Brewer approached the stand, where . there were parents of disabled children, and asked what the charity . did. According to Ms Court he said that children with special needs cost . too much money. Fortunately, she added, none of the parents heard his comments. His comments sparked a negative reaction from fellow councillors, council officials, and thousands of angry readers. Katie Price, whose son Harvey is . severely disabled, also waded in on the row saying 'Colin [sic] Brewer . how would you like to dispose of my son Harvey???' Her comments were echoed by the readers of the Plymouth Herald, 97 per cent of whom said he should quit. Trevor . Doughty said: 'As director of children's services for Cornwall Council I . am shocked and disappointed by the remarks made by Councillor Brewer. 'The comments were cruel and ignorant and are contrary to the Council’s policy of supporting all people with disabilities. 'We . are very proud of the disability services provided in Cornwall and wish . to totally disassociate ourselves with these completely unacceptable . views.' Katie Price (pictured left with her disabled son Harvey, right) today condemned Mr Brewer's comments saying 'many disabled [people] contribute more to society than Mr Brewer' Steve Paget, chairman of Disability Cornwall, said: 'It is of great concern to us that anyone with such believes, let alone to vocalise them, could be a representative and elected member of our local authority. 'For such a serious issue and . multiple breaches of conduct, bringing the council into disrepute, we . did expect no less than this councillor's resignation.' In a bid to justify what he said, Mr Brewer told the Plymouth Herald: . 'I had come to their stall after a long council meeting and I was . probably a little bit het up as we had had some difficult debates.' In . that meeting he heard that some disabled children were being moved out . of the county for care which was 'incurring additional expense'. In . a letter to the charity Mr Brewer said: 'I am writing to offer my . wholehearted apologies for the offences these remarks have clearly . caused. 'While I meant no . offence by my remarks to you, I can see, in retrospect, that they were . ill-judged and insensitive and should not have been made at all.' Cornwall Council (pictured) distanced itself from Mr Brewer's 'cruel and ignorant' comments . Councillor Jan Powell, a Liberal . Democrat on Cornwall Council, said: 'I'm shocked. I can't believe that a . councillor could even contemplate saying something like that even to . stimulate debate. For me it is a resignation issue.' Mr . Brewer said: 'We had had a difficult morning deciding on budget and job . cuts. I listened to one of the ladies on the Disability Cornwall stall . and came out with the comment. If only I had not said that. 'I didn't mean it. I did it to provoke a response and debate the issue of service costs provision. 'It backfired. I was treating her with a lack of respect and I shouldn't have done it. I meant no offence. I would defend disabled children to the last. 'I said it to stimulate conversation but it was the wrong type of thing to say. It is not something I believe. I didn't get the reaction I wanted. He added: 'We all make mistakes.

"By . Pat Hagan . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 2 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:43 EST, 2 March 2013 . Bald truth: TV presenter Martin Roberts today . The facade, when seen from the front at least, was immaculate – ageless even. Pop around the back, though, and the view was, some might say, in dire need of repairs. Homes Under The Hammer host Martin Roberts is as well known for his ‘big hair’ as he is for his eye for a bargain. The highlights may have become subtler since he presented Wish You Were Here in the Nineties, but the hairsprayed bouffant remained immovable. However, the 49-year-old has been hiding something from his two million viewers: a large bald patch on his crown. And, not one to shy away from renovation work, last November Martin secretly underwent a hair-transplant operation. The father of two, who later this year celebrates a decade of presenting the series, joined celebrities such as Wayne Rooney and Jason Donovan in opting for a surgical solution to overcome hair loss. Last year, almost 300,000 of these operations took place – and 83 per cent of patients were men. The boom is in part due to how common hair loss is: a quarter of men are balding by the age of 30. Yet Martin admits the big reveal – as it’s known in the home makeover business – is yet to come. It can take up to a year for transplanted hair follicles to spring to life, which is why the back of his head looks pretty much the same as it did before the £12,000 procedure. And in that time, as our pictures show, he is left wondering: Has it worked at all? ‘I think I’m holding up reasonably well for my age,’ Martin says. ‘But a few years ago, I went for a trim and when the hairdresser held up a mirror, I noticed a visible patch of scalp.’ Worse was to come. ‘Since then, I’ve been aware of it much more when I’ve been doing the show,’ he continues. ‘Whenever I saw myself turn around on camera, I really noticed I was balding.’ Those who experience hair loss . earlier in life might consider a man nearing 50 lucky to still have most . of his. But Martin wasn’t happy. ‘My hairstyle has become a bit of a trademark. When I’m in the . supermarket and haven’t done my hair, no one knows who I am. Suddenly I . had to consider asking the cameraman to be careful how he shoots me.’ A-head of the game: Before and after the painstaking £12,000 hair transplant surgery . Martin, who lives near Bath with his wife Kirsty, 44, and their two children, had the treatment at the Crown Clinic in Manchester. The clinic is run by leading transplant surgeon Asim Shahmalak, who approached Martin after noticing his bald patch on the show. The technique Dr Shahmalak opted for – follicular unit extraction – involved transplanting 4,200 individual hairs from the back of the head to the crown in a procedure spread over two days. ‘I wasn’t sure about it right up to the last minute,’ says Martin. ‘With any medical procedure where injections are given and incisions are made, there are risks. It was all explained to me but I was still nervous. In the end, it wasn’t painful, as the scalp is completely anaesthetised. The staff even had Homes Under The Hammer on the TV while they were doing the procedure.’ Dr Shahmalak says: ‘There is minimal bleeding. The hair itself falls out within a few weeks but the root remains in place. After six months, new hair will start to appear but it can take up to a year for some people to really notice a difference. The success rate in terms of healthy new growth is 90 to 95 per cent.’ Even the best surgeons admit up to 15 per cent of transplanted follicles fail to grow. As well as transplanted hair going into shock and falling out, so too can existing hair. Men can also continue to lose hair after a transplant – so, over time, they may require more than one operation. However, there is a limit to how many transplants a person can have. ‘We have 100,000 hairs on our head and we can move up to 7,000 hairs in one operation and up to 25,000 over a lifetime,’ says Dr Bessam Farjo, of the Farjo Medical Centre. Head start: Martin with fellow Homes Under The Hammer presenter Lucy Alexander . After the operation, men have to sleep sitting up so the newly sewn roots do not get dislodged, and they are advised to avoid washing their hair for a week, because roots need to develop a healthy new blood supply. Five per cent of patients experience complications, including scarring, rashes and bleeding bumps. For every success, there is evidence of high-profile failures: Nicolas Cage and Mel Gibson are both rumoured to have undergone hair transplants and are still balding. But finding solid statistics on failure rates is impossible. ‘Clinics would never disclose such a thing as an unsatisfied patient,’ explains consumer champion Spencer Stevenson, who runs the hair-loss advice website spexhair.co.uk. He underwent five hair transplants – at a cost of £33,000 – before finally getting a good result. ‘Clinics prey on the vulnerable,’ he adds. ‘In my experience, patients often end up disappointed, especially in Britain. UK transplant clinics are not highly regarded – that is why so many men travel to Europe and America instead. Failure is rife and I would say 50 per cent of men who come to me for advice are seeking repairs after having work done in Britain. Often they say there were rushed into a decision.’ Stevenson hears from men who had outdated procedures, have unnatural-looking hair growth or little growth at all, or scarring in the transplanted area ‘to the point where the patient is disfigured’. He also claims celebrities such as Martin often add to the confusion: ‘I have heard from men who have visited surgeons with high-profile clients and had disastrous results,’ he says. ‘Maybe the celebrities – who often get their operation for free in return for agreeing to publicity – were just fortunate, or maybe they got better treatment. Who knows?’ Martin admits he did not pay for his procedure but says he would have. Despite the concerns, demand continues unabated. Dr Shahmalak says: ‘There has been a 25 per cent increase in demand in the past two to three years. One reason is there are clear psychological benefits for some men. I often see men who are depressed and anxious because of their hair loss.’ Join the club: Footballer Wayne Rooney, pictured with wife Coleen, has also had a hair transplant . A 2005 study in Spain looked at how hair loss affected psychological wellbeing. Researchers quizzed 1,500 men and found that two-thirds of those who had hair loss suffered a drop in self-confidence. Martin believes the operation was worth it. ‘Lots of blokes will happily spend £12,000 on a car but not on their bodies. It’s crazy that a man should feel embarrassed about having a transplant.’ Only those closest to him have been informed – until now. The only visible sign after surgery was the short growth at the back of the head that was shaved to remove the follicles for transplant. Martin admits he would be ‘a bit annoyed’ if his hair failed to improve, but says he remains ‘optimistic’. He adds: ‘In the photos I think I can see new hair growing. Will it end up being a full bushy head of hair? Only time will tell.’ crownclinic.co.uk . The current gold standard procedures of hair restoration surgery are ultra-refined follicular unit transplant (FUT), and follicular unit extraction (FUE). A single root produces one hair, but roots are found in clusters of two, three or four, which share blood supply and essential glands. This is a follicular unit. FUT involves taking skin from the back of the scalp and, under a microscope, dissecting the follicular units before implanting them at angles in tiny incisions in the area that is balding.Preserving the follicular unit and its blood supply gives a more natural appearance and increases survival rates of grafts. The term ‘ultra-refined’ refers to how densely packed the grafts are – about 45 hairs per square centimetre. FUE involves using a small  drill to remove intact follicular units directly from the scalp. It is a more lengthy and technical difficult procedure, and can  cost more. Although cheaper than FUE, the disadvantage of the FUT procedure is a thin but potentially noticeable scar across the back of the head. ‘For patients who are over 40 and don’t wear their hair very short, I recommend FUT as it’s quicker, less expensive, and the scar is easily hidden,’ explains Dr Bessam Farjo. ‘In a younger patient, where future hair loss is difficult to predict, FUE is often preferable. It is more expensive but the scarring is scattered over the back of the scalp.’ Reputable clinics should be registered with the Care Quality Commission. Dr Farjo says: ‘Last year, about two per cent of patients were unhappy with the results of their surgery after 12 months – usually with the amount of hair regrowth – according to our audits. Any surgeon who can’t instantly tell you their figure either doesn’t know, which goes against CQC recommendations, or they don’t want to tell you the truth.’ Trusted organisations include the International Alliance of Hair Restoration Surgeons (iahrs.org), the Hair Transplant Network (hairtransplantnetwork.com), and the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (ishrs.org).","Television presenter Martin Roberts spent £12,000 on a hair transplant .

Moving forward: The UK boss of Twitter, Tony Wang, pictured, has personally apologised to women who have been attacked by 'trolls' on the social networking site . The UK boss of Twitter has personally apologised to women who have been attacked by trolls on the social networking site and vowed to do more to protect people from abuse. Tony Wang, general manager of Twitter UK, posted a series of tweets today saying abuse was 'simply not acceptable.' There has been growing concern over abuse . on the site after three female journalists said they had been the . subject of bomb threats, while two received threats of rape. Mr Wang wrote: 'I personally apologise to the women who have experienced abuse on Twitter and for what they have gone through. 'The abuse they've received is simply not acceptable. It's not acceptable in the real world, and it's not acceptable on Twitter. 'There is more we can and will be doing to protect our users against abuse. That is our commitment.' His messages come as Twitter today clarified its rules on abusive behaviour amid a growing backlash over a series of attacks. The company has updated its rules to make it clear that abuse will not be tolerated and has put extra staff in place to handle reports of abuse, it said today. The move comes as Scotland Yard said its e-crime unit is investigating allegations by eight people of abuse on the microblogging site. An online petition calling for Twitter to add a 'report abuse' button to tweets has already attracted more than 124,000 signatures. In a message posted on its blog today, Mr Wang and Twitter's senior director for trust and safety, Del Harvey, said: 'It comes down to this: people deserve to feel safe on Twitter.' They said the clarified rules make clear that Twitter will not tolerate abusive behaviour, and an 'in-tweet' report button has been added so people can report abusive behaviour directly from a tweet. Determined: Tony Wang, general manager of Twitter UK, posted this series of tweets today saying abuse was 'simply not acceptable' 'We want people to feel safe on Twitter, and we want the Twitter rules to send a clear message to anyone who thought that such behaviour was, or could ever be, acceptable,' they wrote. They said additional staff are being added to the teams which handle abuse reports, adding: 'We are committed to making Twitter a safe place for our users.' The bomb threat tweet was sent to Guardian columnist Hadley Freeman, Independent columnist Grace Dent and Europe editor of Time magazine Catherine Mayer, as well as a number of other women. In separate incidents, Labour MP Stella . Creasy and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully fought for . a woman's face to appear on £10 banknotes, were threatened on Twitter . with rape. Two arrests have already been made in relation to those . threats. Worrying: Independent columnist Grace Dent received this tweet earlier in the week along with a number of other female journalists . The anonymous Twitter accounts from which the bomb threats originated were suspended, although screen grabs were widely circulated online. Scotland Yard said an investigation into eight allegations had been launched. The force said: 'Detectives from the Specialist Organised & Economic Crime Command have taken responsibility for the investigations into a number of allegations recently made to the MPS relating to allegations of malicious communication made on the social networking site Twitter. 'The Police Central e-Crime Unit (PCeU), who hold the police national cyber crime remit, is now investigating allegations made by eight people that they have been subject to harassment, malicious communication or bomb threats."" It said the decision was taken to centralise the individual investigations, including three from outside London. Victims: Labour MP Stella Creasy, left, and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, right, successfully fought for a woman's face to appear on £10 banknotes and were threatened on Twitter with rape . Ms Criado-Perez, 29, said today: 'While I'm pleased they're listening, it's taken Twitter a week to come up with this. 'Twitter's ""report abuse"" button on the iPhone application goes through to the old reporting form - what we're looking for is an overhaul of the system which sits behind the button. 'The current process is lengthy, complicated and impossible to use if you're under sustained attack like I have been. 'Right now, all the emphasis is on the victim, often under intense pressure, to report rather than for Twitter to track down the perpetrator and stop them. 'I am, of course, pleased that they are taking on new staff. The hard facts are that this will take time, investment and properly trained and paid staff - but it's crucial they get this right.' Cracking down: Twitter today clarified its rules on abusive behaviour amid a growing backlash over a series of attacks . Steve White, of the Police Federation, said the problem was 'unpoliceable' and more needed to be done by social media organisations. He told BBC Breakfast: 'The organisations that run these social media platforms probably need to take a long, hard look, they need to take some responsibility. 'It's much like when you go into a shop - there are prevention measures within shops, whether it be security guards or things locked away that you can't get to, which is going to prevent crime, and I think social media sites need to think long and hard about being able to prevent it from happening in the first place. 'Crime has completely changed. Internet crime and e-crime, including the kind of trolling that we've seen this week, is hugely on the rise. Members of the public don't really understand what to do about it as well, so it goes unreported. ""We can't possibly deal with every single comment that someone doesn't like on these social media platforms, but I think the Government's got to take a long, hard look at resources and have got to understand that there is a changing face of crime in this country, and the police service needs to adapt to that and the resources need to be there to do it.'","Tony Wang posted series of tweets today saying abuse was 'not acceptable'

Fewer than half of Labour supporters want to see Ed Miliband lead the party into the next election, according to a devastating poll last night. Just 46 per cent of those who voted Labour in 2010 said they would like to see him still in post in two years' time. Thirty-four per cent said he should go, with the rest saying they were undecided. The humiliating ICM poll, published in the Daily Mirror, will further add to pressure on the beleaguered Labour leader, who has been accused of allowing the Coalition parties to snatch the political initiative during the summer political recess. Last night Labour MP Tom Harris accused his party's leadership of spending too much time obsessing about policies designed to impress 'tofu eaters' rather than ordinary voters. The ICM poll showed that across all voters, just 26 per cent want Mr Miliband to continue leading the party, with 40 per cent saying he should go. Only 21 per cent of voters say they are satisfied with Mr Miliband's performance, but even Labour supporters are not impressed. Less than half of those who voted for the party in 2010 - 45 per cent - are satisfied with him. Some 31 per cent are dissatisfied. The poll does at least show that Mr Miliband has more backing than anyone else - including his brother - to be Labour leader. But he trails David Cameron on several aspects of leadership including 'tough decisions', running the economy and foreign affairs - but beats him on honesty and 'being in touch'. Labour MP Tom Harris (left) says that the party leadership is out of touch with ordinary voters, while former London mayor Ken Livingstone has been defending Miliband . Yesterday Glasgow South MP Tom Harris launched an attack on the Labour leadership, singling out for criticism the plan to bring in votes for 16 year olds, announced at the weekend by the party's justice spokesman Sadiq Khan. He suggested that Labour should be taking its cue from issues in its mailbag, not middle-class dinner party goers. Writing for the Telegraph, he said: 'It may well be that when Sadiq Khan opens his mail in the morning, almost all his correspondents are demanding that a priority of the next Labour government must be to lower the voting age to 16. After all, what else would they have to complain about in Tooting? On BBC Radio 4's Today programme David Blunkett, senior minister throughout the Blair-Brown years, explained what Labour - and Ed Miliband - needs to do to rally support. He defended the beleaguered leader by saying that public opinion fluctuated, arguing that the poll's depended on 'what month you take it'. 'Not a few months ago he was being praised for tackling issues and his conference speech,' Mr Blunkett said. 'The worst job in politics is leader of the opposition.' He said that Labour now had some strong policies after its disaster at the voting polls. 'We lost a large number of elections before we got our act together,' he said. He claimed the real challenge for Labour now was not it's leader or the people in the party, but making sure the public had an idea of what its policies were and eradicating the idea that Labour was responsible for a slew of problems. He accused the coalition government of developing since 2010 'a clever mantra that everything that was wrong was down to Labour - we need to get out of this perspective that we were to blame. '... we should be proud of what we did and learn from our mistakes.' He said the government needed to get a 'hearing' about what it had achieved, and what its policies are in time for the 2015 election. He said: 'We need to work out how to get a higher profile in circumstances that make it hard to get a hearing. 'We need to be clear and make sure we join our policies up so they are linked and people can see what the party wants and looks like.' 'But in 12 years representing Glasgow South, I've received precisely no requests from constituents - including younger ones who might actually benefit - to support such a move. 'And when I've been given the chance to ask classrooms of teenagers what they think of the idea, they've generally been apathetic or opposed.' Mr Harris said that people the policy was labelled 'progressive', those who opposed votes at 16 were caricatured as 'nasty reactionaries who hate young people', when in fact he just wasn't impressed with a policy whose justification goes no further than 'It will engage young people'. He said the Labour leadership seemed to be more interested in persuading the Lib Dems to enter into a post-2015 coalition than in garnering support among the people. 'Votes at 16 isn't being demanded by anyone, least of all 16-year-olds who, oddly, have more important things to do with their time than worry about who to vote for. Teenagers, eh? Tch! 'But it's exactly the kind of middle-class dinner party issue that tofu eaters throughout the country get really excited about. And that certainly includes Nick Clegg's minions. Not for them the irritating and, frankly, dull issues of employment and the cost of living. 'If Labour is starting to move away from talking about real-life issues to talking instead about irrelevant, niche subjects that will imprss and affect nobody, then that's sending a very clear message to the Lib Dems: you can do business with us.' Mr Miliband did at least get some backing yesterday - from Ken Livingstone. The lefty former London mayor launched a scathing attack on Lord Prescott after he criticised Labour's summer performance, and told the peer: 'You screwed it up - don't try and wreck it for others.' He urged Mr Miliband to ignore Lord Prescott, saying: 'For Prescott to criticise anyone else given his record in government is just ridiculous. The last thing Ed Miliband needs to do is take advice from him.' Mr Livingstone hailed Mr Miliband as a 'the most impressive Labour leader' since John Smith. 'He is a genuine Labour leader. He is not obsessed by short-term trivia, he is thinking about how Britain should be in 25 years' time,' he added.","Thirty-four per cent of Labour supporters want Ed Miliband to go .

"Magistrate told parents that they could not call their son 'Messiah' By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:55 EST, 25 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:36 EST, 25 October 2013 . A judge in Tennessee who ordered a baby's name changed from Messiah to Martin has been charged with violating the state's Code of Judicial Conduct. Child Support Magistrate Lu Ann Ballew ordered the name change during a paternity hearing in Newport on August 8. At the time, the parents were disputing the 8-month-old baby's surname. The boy's mother, Jaleesa Martin, hoped to keep the name she had given the boy- Messiah Deshawn Martin - and father, Jawaan McCullough, wanted the baby to bear his last name. Christian: Magistrate Ballew has strong feelings about children being named after Jesus - but not with the name Jesus . Naming rights: Mother Jaleesa Martin is refusing to change her child's name . Ballew surprised both parents by ordering the baby's name be changed to Martin Deshawn McCullough, saying the name Messiah was not in the baby's best interest. Her written order said '`Messiah' is a title that is held only by Jesus Christ.' 'Labeling this child ""Messiah"" places an undue burden on him that as a human being, he cannot fulfill,' the order said. Ballew further stated that 'it is highly likely that he will offend many Cocke County citizens by calling himself ""Messiah,""' but she carried through on the ban anyway. That decision was overturned in Cocke County Chancery Court the following month, with the judge saying that Ballew's ruling violated the U.S. Constitution. Name changer: A judge in eastern Tennessee ordered for the baby boy's first name to Martin from Messiah . 'I was shocked. I never intended on naming my son Messiah because it means God and I didn't think a judge could make me change my baby's name because of her religious beliefs,' Ms Martin said. The boy is now officially called Messiah DeShawn McCollough. The mother's two other children are called Micah and Mason and she argued that she wanted to name her third child with an M too. Messiah is ranked 387th most popular baby name according to the Social Security Administration's 2012 list of names.

Mother Jalessa Martin (pictured) is over the moon about her baby boy keeping his name as Messiah . It was revealed earlier that magistrate Ballew first ruled to keep the original name but then changed the written record and held a second hearing. On Wednesday, a panel of the Tennessee Board of Judicial Conduct filed formal charges against Ballew. Among other things, the code requires that judges perform all duties without bias or prejudice based on religion. Ballew has 30 days to answer the charges.","Magistrate told parents that they could not call their son 'Messiah'

If you suffer from a fear of heights, perhaps this one's not for you. The Bailong Elevator, also known as the Hundred Dragons Elevator, carries tourists 1,070ft (330m) up the side of a massive sandstone column in a mountain range in China's Hunan Province. Riding the glass lift, which carries up to 50 people at a time or 1,380 an hour, offers jaw-dropping, not to say vertiginous, views down to the bottom of the rocky mountain range in the Wulingyuan area of Zhangijiajie. Work began on the lift, which cost 120m yuan, or around £12m, in 1999 and finished in 2002. The project met with fierce criticism from environmentalists who were angry that it was sited in the middle of a World Heritage Site. Lift shafts and tunnels had to be dug into the quartz sandstone column chosen from thousands in the area, and earthquake detectors installed so that the lifts (there are three of them) could be evacuated quickly in case of disaster. Those in favour of the project said that the elevators, which are said to boast the biggest passenger capacity in the world, saved the mountain trails from excess traffic. But protestors said the area, which attracts 5m visitors each year, was already saturated with tourists and did not need another attraction to boost that number further. After it was built, the lift was said to be the world's tallest full-exposure outdoor lift, tallest double-deck sightseeing elevator, and the fastest passenger elevator with the biggest capacity, according to Industrytap.com.

It reopened in 2003 and now has a cult following from tourists keen to ride a lift known as one of the most terrifying in the world for its sheer drop views down to the bottom of the valley. Those whose fear of heights prohibits them from taking the lift can instead take a two-and-a-half hour walk up the valley.

After releasing exciting images of Mars, NASA's Curiosity rover is undergoing a crucial four day ‘brain transplant’. Engineers were today continuing to update the rover’s software which is currently in its flight stage to prepare it for its further missions on Mars, NASA said. Today Nasa released the first high resolution Panorama from the craft. Scroll down for video . The first high resolution panoramic shot from Curiosity's mast camera reveals its surrounding in stunning new detail . After successfully landing on the Red . Planet on August 5, the rover produced incredible pictures showing . exactly what you would see if you were standing on the surface of Mars . on a late afternoon. 'The images show a landscape that closely resembles portions of the southwestern United States in its morphology, adding to the impression gained from the lower-resolution thumbnail mosaic released early in the week,' said a Nasa spokesman. 'The colors in the main image are unmodified from those returned by the camera. 'While it is difficult to say whether this is what a human eye would see, it is what a cell phone or camcorder would record since the Mastcam takes color pictures in the exact same manner that consumer cameras acquire color images.' The parts of this mosaic that are most interesting to geologists include a section on the crater wall north of the landing site where a network of valleys believed to have formed by water erosion enters Gale Crater from the outside. They are also studying a section that looks south of the landing site that provides an overview of the eventual geological targets Curiosity will explore, including the rock-strewn, gravelly surface nearby, the dark dune field and the layered buttes and mesas of the sedimentary rock of Mount Sharp.Geologists are also taking a close look at an area excavated by the blast of the Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage rockets (below). With the loose debris blasted away by the rockets, details of the underlying materials are clearly seen. Of particular note is a well-defined, topmost layer that contains fragments of rock embedded in finer material. During the software update, engineers will add two crucial functions to Curiosity – the ability to drive over the planet’s rocky terrain and the ability to use the geochemistry lab’s sampling system. New images from NASA's Curiosity rover shows an area excavated by the blast of the Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage rocket engines . The team also today received a call from the President congratulating them. 'It's inspiring to all of us,' he said. 'Photographs that are coming back are going to be remarkable and amazing,' President Obama said. 'Through your dedicated effort, Curiosity stuck her landing and captured the attention and imagination of millions of people,' he said, using the gymnastics term the day after the Olympic Games wrapped up in London.'It's really mind-boggling what you've been able to accomplish, and being able to get that whole landing sequence to work the way you did is a testimony to your team,' Obama said . Stunning: NASA's Curiosity rover released its first colour landscape pictures from Mars on Thursday. The view shows the mountains looming in the distance . Brain transplant: Engineers are performing a four day software update on the Curiosity, pictured here showing the surface of Mars . A handout photo provided by U.S. Space Agency NASA on 09 August 2012 shows the first 360-degree panorama in color of the Gale Crater landing site taken by NASA's Curiosity rover . On Friday, engineers detailed how Curiosity landed approximately 1.5 miles from its predicted touchdown spot. The . excellent panoramic images, released on Thursday, were the first colour . landscape photographs provided from the $2.5 billion Martian rover and . were taken with the probe's MastCams which extend above the spacecraft. The . panoramic mosaic, comprising 130 separate images that Curiosity . captured with its newly activated navigation cameras, shows a . rust-colored, pebble-strewn expanse stretching to a wall of the crater's . rim in one direction and a tall mound of layered rock in another. That formation, named Mount Sharp, stands at the center of the vast, ancient impact crater and several miles from where Curiosity touched down at the end of an eight-month voyage across 352 million mile (566 million km) of space. The layers of exposed rock are thought to hold a wealth of Mars' geologic history, making it the main target of exploration for scientists who will use the rover to seek evidence of whether the planet most similar to Earth might now harbor or once have hosted key ingredients for microbial life. Nasa also revealed a new colour corrected picture of the area the rover landed, clearly showing the rocks and other debris . The mission controllers also released the rover's first self-portrait which was stitched together to show an uninterrupted view of Curiosity standing on the surface of the Red Planet. Eight shots were used to create the panoramic picture using the rover's twin navigation cameras, or Navcam which are used to capture 3D images.

Blast marks from the rocket engine's that brought the car sized rover can clearly be seen in the image below, which forms part of the panorama. Scientists believe that the soil on mars is relatively shallow, which will help Curiosity's instruments get access to the underlying rock easily. 'These Navcam images indicate that our powered descent stage did more than give us a great ride, it gave our science team an amazing freebie,' said John Grotzinger, project scientist for the mission from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 'The thrust from the rockets actually dug a one-and-a-half-foot-long [0.5 meter] trench in the surface. 'It appears we can see Martian bedrock on the bottom. Its depth below the surface is valuable data we can use going forward.' The panorama reveals dark marks on the surface caused tby the lander's rocket engines as it descended . Nasa has also released more self portraits taken by the rover, which they have been using to check for signs of damage. Visible in the photograph are pebbles . resting on the top of the craft which have been kicked up by the landing . of the multi-billion dollar exploration vehicle. However, mission controllers believe the craft is, so far, responding perfectly to their commands.

Pebbles are visible on the top . Part of the deck of NASA's Curiosity rover on Mars, taken from one of the rover's Navigation cameras looking toward the back left of the rover . But mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Los Angeles are exercising caution immediately following Curiosity's jarring, death-defying descent to the surface on Sunday night. They plan to spend weeks putting the nuclear-powered, six-wheeled rover and its sophisticated array of instruments through a painstaking series of 'health' checks before embarking on the thrust of their science mission in earnest. The $2.5 billion Curiosity project, formally named the Mars Science Laboratory, is NASA's first astrobiology mission since the Viking probes of the 1970s and is touted as the first fully equipped mobile geochemistry lab ever sent to a distant world. Earth-like landscape: This image released by NASA and taken by cameras aboard the Curiosity rover shows the Martian horizon scientists say resembles the Mojave Desert . Comparing: The Mojave Desert stretches throughout southeastern and central California as well as southern Nevada, southwestern Utah and northwestern Arizona, in the United States . A strange blob is visible on the left . Conspiracy theorists have already worked themselves up into a lather over a mysterious blotch visible in the first black and white photographs taken from NASA's new Curiosity rover as it landed on Mars. However, two hours later when the satellite made another pass over Curiosity, the rover sent another batch of images that revealed that the blotch had disappeared. After three full days on the Red Planet, 'Curiosity continues to behave flawlessly' and has 'executed all planned activities' without a hitch, mission manager Michael Watkins said at a JPL news briefing. The latest round of equipment checks included an instrument designed to determine mineral composition of powdered rock and soil samples; one to analyze soil and atmospheric samples for organic compounds; one to detect traces of water locked in shallow mineral deposits; and another that uses particle X-rays to identify chemical elements in rocks and soils. The very delivery of Curiosity to the surface of Mars already has been hailed by NASA as the greatest feat of robotic spaceflight. The car-sized rover, which flew from Earth encased in a protective capsule, blasted into the Martian sky at hypersonic speed and landed safely seven minutes later after an elaborate, daredevil descent combining a giant parachute with a rocket-pack that lowered the rover to the Martian surface on a tether. Since then, the rover has been . sending a string of early images back to Earth, relayed by two NASA . satellites orbiting Mars, providing glimpses of a terrain that . scientists say appear reminiscent of the Mojave Desert in Southern . California. One shot . beamed back late Wednesday night, the first taken by Curiosity of . itself, shows the rover's top deck strewn with dark pebbles apparently . kicked up from the ground when the craft landed.

NASCAR driver Jason Leffler died after an accident Wednesday night in a heat race at a dirt car event at Bridgeport Speedway. Apparently his Sprint Car flipped when he hit a stretch of the 5/8-mile and high banked the dirt oval. Witnesses say he was extracted from the car and airlifted from the track by helicopter. The rest of the event was cancelled. The 37-year-old Leffler, a two-time winner on the NASCAR Nationwide Series, was pronounced dead shortly after 9 p.m., New Jersey State Police said. 'NASCAR extends its thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies to the family of Jason Leffler who passed away earlier this evening,' NASCAR said in a statement. 'For more than a decade, Jason was a fierce competitor in our sport and he will be missed.' After losing his NASCAR ride, Leffler had been racing dirt car events most of this year, including the 410 Sprint Car race Wednesday that promised a $7,000 prize to the winner at the 0.625-mile, high-banked dirt oval. On Sunday, Leffler finished last at Pocono in his lone NASCAR Sprint Cup start of the year. From Long Beach, Calif., Leffler made 423 starts in NASCAR's three national series, but won just the two Nationwide races and one Truck Series event in a career that began in 1999. He also made three IndyCar Series starts, finishing 17th in the 2000 Indianapolis 500. Scroll down for video . The wreckage: Leffler was pronounced dead Wednesday night, shortly after the crash.

The passenger aircraft of the future could one day be flown by remote by pilots sitting in a control room hundreds of miles away. Tests on a new breed of civilian aircraft which use the same pilotless technology currently found in military drones begin next month in the UK. The consortium behind the project hopes it will dramatically slash the costs of air travel, make possible new airborne services, and free pilots from potentially dangerous but essential missions. Scroll down for video . Would you get in? A Jetstream aircraft like this one will be used in the first tests of pilotless, remote-controlled civilian aircraft set to begin in the skies over the UK next month . A twin-engined Jetstream commuter jet will take off from Warton Aerodrome, Lancashire and head north entirely under remote control towards Scotland within a few weeks, The Economist reports. Staged by government-backed consortium Autonomous Systems Technology Related Airborne Evaluation and Assessment (ASTRAEA), the test are will look at how well communications links operate with pilotless aircraft. It will also test failsafe systems that will allow the aircraft's computers to take autonomous control of the flight should contact with the ground be broken. ASTRAEA is a £62million programme backed by the British government and seven aerospace companies including UK firms BAE, QinetiQ and Rolls-Royce. Modern planes are already capable of taking off, flying to a destination and landing with no human interference whatsoever. But the Jetstream test will see whether they are able to do those things safely without a pilot - while at the same time complying with the rules of the skies. Death from above: A U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone takes off from Kandahar, Afghanistan . The unmanned aircraft will need to be . able to 'sense and avoid' other planes that may cross its path. In the . case of large-scale commercial aircraft this is easy. In most cases . these are equipped with transponders warning of the plane's presence - . and sometimes its course, altitude and speed. It’s one of the drawbacks for anyone setting off for far-flung places: How bad will the jet lag be when you get there? Those feelings of tiredness and disorientation could become a thing of the past, however - thanks to what are claimed to be the world’s first ‘time-control’ spectacles. The high-tech glasses emit a soft green glow which is said to work on the human body clock to change our sleep patterns. Using the device, called the Re-Timer, means long-haul air passengers can step off the plane feeling fresh, even after a flight from Britain to Australia, say the sleep researchers who created it. Inventor Professor Leon Lack said the glasses could also help insomnia sufferers, keep shift workers more alert and get teenagers out of bed in the morning. ‘The light from Re-Timer stimulates the part of the brain responsible for regulating the 24-hour body clock,’ said Professor Lack, of Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia. ‘Using a light device allows you to transition your body clock to a new time zone in small steps. This eliminates the sudden change people experience after flying and reduces the symptoms of jet lag.’ However, . light aircraft and gliders are not legally required to be equipped with . such beacons, meaning that ASTRAEA's Jetstream must also be able to . 'see' through video cameras attached to image-recognition software. In . other tests, to be carried out over the Irish Sea, aircraft will be . flown near to the unmanned plane, with some following a deliberate . collision course to see whether the drone can recognise the danger and . take evasive action. 'The . results to date suggest you can do sense-and-avoid as well as a human,' Lambert Dopping-Hepenstal, director of ASTRAEA, told The Economist. The market for such a technology is potentially huge, and lucrative. In the U.S., Congress has asked aviation regulators to make unmanned aircraft work with the existing air-traffic control system as soon as 2015. Small drones are already used commercially for things like aerial photography, but in most jurisdictions they must remain within sight of their pilot on the ground. With the costs of pilotless aircraft much lower than manned aircraft or helicopters, such commercial drones could make tasks like road traffic monitoring, border patrols, police surveillance far cheaper. They also have potential applications in environments which pose a risk to pilots, including monitoring forest fires or accidents at nuclear power plants. They even have the potential for providing temporary airborne Wi-Fi or mobile phone services. By 2020, the global market for civilian unmanned aircraft and services could, according to some analysts be worth more than $50billion, The Economist reported. Commercial freight and postal flights could one day also lose on-board pilots, but questions remain as to whether airlines could persuade customers to board pilotless passenger aircraft - no matter what the discount. The hope is, rather, that such flights will have just one pilot in the future, rather than the team of two found on most modern airliners.","Civilian aircraft would use same pilotless technology as military drones .

Job done: 'I am more convinced than ever in the strength and staying power of America's global leadership and our capacity to be a force for good in the world,' Clinton said in a letter to President Barack Obama shortly before she left the State Department . Her resignation became effective on the swearing-in of her successor, John Kerry, who took take the oath of office in a private ceremony later Friday. The former Massachusetts senator and 2004 presidential candidate was sworn in Friday by Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan becoming the 68th secretary of state. 'I'm just very, very honored to be sworn in and I'm very anxious to get to work,' Kerry told reporters after the private ceremony at the Capitol. 'I'll be reporting Monday morning at 9 o'clock to do my part.' Kerry told The Boston Globe earlier on Friday that he was President Obama’s choice for secretary of state for some time, even as UN Ambassador Susan Rice came under heavy fire as a possible nominee for the position. ‘He called me, actually a week before Susan got out of the thing,’ said Kerry. ‘He called me and said, ‘You’re my choice. I want you to do this.’ He asked me to keep it quiet. I did. I sat on it.’ Kerry was sworn in at around 4pm EST on Friday as his predecessor’s resignation became official. Thanks: Clinton thanked Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns as she addressed employees at the State Department for the final time as Secretary of State . Touching moment: Employees at the State Department gave an emotional goodbye to their former leader . In the State Department's main lobby, . Clinton pushed through a throng of American foreign service workers who . clamored for handshakes and smartphone photos with her and gave an . emotional goodbye speech. She told them to continue to ‘serve the nation we all love, to understand the challenges, the threats and the opportunities that the United States faces and to work with all our heart and all of our might to make sure that America is secure, that our interests are promoted and our values are respected.’ Clinton, however, also left office with a slap at critics of the Obama administration's handling of the September attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya. She told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday that critics of the administration's handling of the attack don't live in an ""evidence-based world,"" and their refusal to ""accept the facts"" is unfortunate and regrettable for the political system. Clinton told the AP that the attack in Benghazi was the low point of her time as America's top diplomat. But she suggested that the furor over the assault would not affect whether she runs for president in 2016. Although she insisted that she has not decided what her future holds, she said she ‘absolutely’ still plans to make a difference on issues she cares about in speeches and in a sequel to her 2003 memoir, ‘Living History,’ that will focus largely on her years as secretary of state. Saying goodbye: Clinton addressed employees at the State Department for the final time as Secretary of State on February 1, 2013, in Washington D.C. Big crowd: In the State Department's main lobby, Clinton pushed through a throng of American foreign service workers who clamored for handshakes and smartphone photos with her and gave an emotional goodbye speech . Clinton spoke to the AP Thursday in her outer office on the seventh floor of the State Department less than 24 hours before she walks out for a final time as boss. She was relaxed but clearly perturbed by allegations from Republican lawmakers and commentators that the administration had intentionally misled the public about whether the attack was a protest gone awry or a terrorist attack, or intentionally withheld additional security for diplomatic personnel in Libya knowing that an attack could happen. An independent panel she convened to look into the incident was scathing in its criticism of the State Department and singled out four officials for serious management and leadership failures. But it also determined that there was no guarantee that extra personnel could have prevented the deaths of the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans. Clinton herself was not blamed, although she has said she accepted responsibility for the situation. ‘I was so unhappy with the way that some people refused to accept the facts, refused to accept the findings of an independent Accountability Review Board, politicized everything about this terrible attack,’ she said. ‘My job is to admit that we have to make improvements and we're going to.’ Low point: Clinton said the day before her resignation that the attack in Benghazi was the low point of her time as America's top diplomat . Hours later a suicide bomber linked to a domestic terror group exploded a device just outside the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, killing himself and a guard. Clinton told State Department staff on Friday that the attack showed again how ‘we live in very complex and dangerous times.’ Clinton faced a barrage of hostile questions about Benghazi from Republican lawmakers when she testified before Congress recently in appearances that were delayed from December because of illness. Afterward, some lawmakers continued to accuse her and the administration of withholding evidence. Republican Senator Lindsay Graham, of South Carolina, told a television interviewer that he thought Clinton was getting ‘away with murder.’ In the interview, Clinton had little patience for such allegations. ‘There are some people in politics and in the press who can't be confused by the facts,’ she said. ‘They just will not live in an evidence-based world. And that's regrettable. It's regrettable for our political system and for the people who serve our government in very dangerous, difficult circumstances.’ Because of that, she said, the partisan divide should not dissuade anyone with a cause from getting involved in politics, and she hinted strongly that a divisive atmosphere would not stop her in any future endeavor. ‘You have to have a thick skin because (politics) is just going to be a contact sport as far as we can look into the future.’ 'No decisions': 'I am making no decisions, but I would never give that advice to someone that I wouldn't take myself,' Clinton said about a potential run for president in 2016 . Clinton is no stranger to partisan politics. As first lady, she railed in 1998 against a ‘vast right-wing conspiracy’ that she asserted had been attacking her husband, Bill Clinton, ever since he had become president. But the woman who was once considered a divisive figure in American politics, yet leaves office as one of its most popular, remained coy about whether she would run for president in 2016. ‘I am making no decisions, but I would never give that advice to someone that I wouldn't take myself,’ she said. ‘If you believe you can make a difference, not just in politics, in public service, in advocacy around all these important issues, then you have to be prepared to accept that you are not going to get 100 per cent approval.’ Farewell: Clinton waved as she left the State Department in Washington for last time as America's top diplomat .","Hillary Rodham Clinton formally resigned Friday as America's 67th secretary of state on Friday at 4 pm .

Ministers have got their sums wrong and left the  controversial high-speed rail scheme with a £3billion funding gap, a report revealed yesterday. Transport bosses have also exaggerated the benefits that the HS2 project will bring to communities in terms of jobs and growth,  the damning analysis of the Government’s business case claims. The publication of the report by the National Audit Office has cast serious doubts over the £33billion rail link and provoked a furious row after a senior minister called the economic justification for it ‘ludicrous’. Ministers have got their sums wrong and left the controversial high-speed rail scheme with a £3billion funding gap, a report says. Pictured, a Eurostar train arrives at Kings Cross St Pancras station . The spending watchdog said it had reservations over how HS2 is expected to transform regional economies with jobs and growth and said current evidence provided a ‘weak foundation’ for success. The findings were backed by Margaret Hodge, chairman of the powerful Commons’ Public Accounts Committee, who said it proved the business case was ‘not up to scratch’ and was underpinned by ‘ludicrous’ assumptions. Saying there was ‘virtually no evidence’ the high speed rail link to the North will support the predicted  economic benefits, she added: ‘An estimated £3billion funding gap has been identified for HS2, already bringing into question the affordability of this project. ‘We have been told that it will deliver around 100,000 jobs but  there is no evidence that all these jobs would not have been created anyway.’ The Labour MP added that transport bosses had ‘belatedly identified errors in their calculations that have wiped £12billion off the expected benefits’ and left themselves ‘no room for mistakes’. The HS2 plan has proved unpopular with many and questions have been raised about the benefits it will bring . ‘Unless the Department (of Transport) gets its act together, HS2 will not deliver all intended benefits for travellers and the regions, and it will not deliver value for the taxpayer,’ Mrs Hodge said. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin hit back by rejecting the report’s ‘core conclusion’ and said there was a clear case that HS2  would generate hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds worth of economic benefits. Borrowing a line from the TV comedy series Little Britain, he insisted: ‘We are not building HS2 simply because the computer says “Yes”. ‘We are building it because it is  the right thing to do to make Britain a stronger and more prosperous place. ‘Economic modelling is just the start of the story – if we only relied on modelling we would not have built the M1, parts of the M25 or the Jubilee line extension to Canary Wharf.’ Hilary Wharf, of the campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, said the report was a ‘scathing indictment’ of a ‘bogus’ business case. ‘HS2 simply cannot withstand independent scrutiny,’ she said.","The National Audit Office report casts doubts over £33billion rail link .

Michael Foreman, 48, died from 'multiple traumatic injuries' after plunging 100ft to his death at London's Tate Modern gallery . The man who plunged 100ft to his death at London’s Tate Modern gallery in front of horrified onlookers was a HSBC bank manager, it was revealed today. Michael Foreman, 48, was reported missing the day before he fell from a private members' balcony on the fifth floor of the gallery just before 6pm last Tuesday evening. An inquest was today opened into his death at Southwark Coroner’s Court after Mr Foreman was formally identified by his wife following the incident. His death - caused by 'multiple traumatic injuries' - was deemed non suspicious, the court heard. The hearing was told: 'On July 23rd he was reported missing to Essex Police. On July 24th he was witnessed to jump from the fifth floor members bar area of the Tate Modern. He was taken to St Thomas Hospital.' Coroner Dr Andrew Harris was told Mr Foreman, who lived with his wife Janet in Essex, was 'a senior bank manager with HSBC'. Mr Foreman’s funeral is due to take place on Friday at Corbets Tey crematorium in Upminster. Devastated friends of the HSBC banker . described him as a 'gentleman' who was 'very passionate' about his . hobby, playing trombone in brass bands. His friends revealed Mr Foreman's . death was a case of 'history repeating itself' as Mr Foreman's brother, . who had also worked for HSBC, died in tragic circumstances after going . for a swim and suffering a heart attack aged just 24. Shocking: Mr Foreman plummeted to the ground from the London art gallery's private members' terrace five floors up . He was a trombonist in the Tilbury brass band in Essex and also used to play regularly with The Aveley and Newham Band in east London. Tilbury brass band member Derek Morris said married Mr Foreman was always a 'gentleman' and worked in HSBC's City HQ where he had a 'good job'. Mr Morris, who also plays trombone, added: 'He had a good job in the City and was always flying to Hong Kong so it makes you think what was going through his mind when he died. 'I've known him for many years as we played for 50 years for the Aveley band. He was a quiet man, but very passionate about the trombone. 'He was very business-like and not very sociable. He was always very well-suited and always a gentleman. 'It's very sad news and I just can't believe it. 'He had a brother who used to work for HSBC too, but he tragically died years ago. 'He went for a swim and had a heart attack. He was 24 when he died and they were both very close.' High season: Major exhibitions of work by Damien Hirst and Edvard Munch were taking place at the London gallery . Sudden death: Police stand guard outside the gallery after the afternoon tragedy . Mr Foreman from the terrace of a bar . and restaurant area as tourists picnicking by the Thames in the late . afternoon sun watched in shock. It was a busy period for the gallery with shows by hugely popular artists Damien Hirst and Edvard Munch taking place. Elodie . Soetaert, 25, an account manager for We Are Social, said: 'We arrived . just after and saw police and police tape everywhere. The body was . covered in tarpaulin and the police had put screens up so we couldn’t . see it. 'It was really shocking. Some people had been playing music and when they stopped it was silent. 'I’d gone for drinks with my friends and I’m happy I arrived after he had fallen because I wouldn’t have wanted to see that.' One Tate employee, who did not want to be named, said: 'I was just finishing my shift when I heard what had happened. 'As I was walking out of the building I saw him on the ground. 'It was horrible. I didn't stop to look at any more. Everybody is so shocked. Nobody is even speaking about it today.' A cyclist who saw a man plunge to his death returned to the gallery yesterday to leave a bunch of flowers at the spot where he died. Bystanders: Day-trippers packing the area around the Thames were aghast at the incident . Drama: Mr Foreman had been reported missing just a day before the tragic incident . The man, who would not give his name, said he did not know the victim, as he laid a bunch of pink lilies outside just after 4pm. Looking visibly upset, he said: 'I was on the balcony of the espresso bar when it happened, which is two floors below where he fell. 'I didn't see or hear anything beforehand I just saw him fall and hit the ground. 'It was awful. It was one of the most shocking things I've ever seen.' Shocked onlookers took to the internet to describe the tragic incident. @CathHannahx wrote on Twitter: ‘Seeing the guy who had committed suicide and jumped off the Tate modern has been the most traumatic thing I have seen.’ Some onlookers at first thought it was 'a staged flash mob thing' and took photographs, tweeted @salmasaid. Another user, @afbsutherland, said: 'Weird day at Tate modern. Sehgal was amazing, the possible suicide outside was pretty awful. Hope it wasn't as bad as it looked.' A spokesman for the museum said: 'Our deepest sympathies go to his family.’ This is not the first time the gallery has encountered tragedy. In 2007, lawyer Matthew Courtney, 27, plunged 80ft down a stairwell leading to the art gallery’s seventh floor restaurant in a tragic accident.","Michael Foreman, 48, fell from a private members' balcony on the fifth floor of the gallery .

"By . Tamara Cohen . UPDATED: . 15:07 EST, 29 January 2012 . A new generation of pesticides may be to blame for the catastrophic decline in Britain’s honey bees. The contain chemicals, routinely used on farms and in garden centres make bees more vulnerable to disease, a study has shown. There have been concerns for some years about neonicotinoids, a family of chemicals based on nicotine, but a study by an expert based in the US finally confirms a link. Threat: Experts believe the sharp decline in Britain's bee population could be . down to an increase in the use of nicotine-based pesticides . Conservationists have called for these pesticides, which became popular in the 1990s, to be banned as the insects are key to human’s survival – pollinating 70 per cent of the crops which produce most of the world’s food. The findings were published by the US government’s top bee expert Dr Jeffrey Pettis, who found that even minute doses of the chemical made bees three times more vulnerable to infections from parasites. Drop: In Britain the number of bees has fallen by half since the 1980s . He said it could be a ‘major contributor’ to the mysterious decline of bees worldwide. In Britain numbers have fallen by half since the 1980s. Matt Shardlow of the charity Buglife, which first raised concerns about these pesticides three years ago said: ‘The science is now clear: bees poisoned by neo-nicotinoids are much more likely to die from diseases, gather less food, and produce fewer new bees.’ Dr Pettis, of the US Department of Agriculture’s Bee Research Laboratory tested bees given doses of imidacloprid –  one of these neo-nicotinoid chemicals, which is produced by Bayer CropScience. His findings are published in the German science journal Naturwissenschaften (CORR). The study shows that in a laboratory setting infections by the nosema parasite – which gives bees dysentery – increased significantly when they were fed pollen spiked with the imidacloprid and then fed a sugar solution containing the bug, compared to those who did not have the chemical. These pesticides were hailed as a breakthrough as they are not applied directly to plants but to the seeds so manufacturers thought they were more environmentally friendly. But it seems tiny quantities of the pesticides stay active in the plant’s nectar and appear to attack bees immune systems. The authors say in young bees, tiny quantities seem to weaken their gut and this could debilitate hives although it does not necessarily kill them off. Other research suggests the chemicals confuse bees, causing them to lose their sense of direction and abandon their colonies. Study: Research in the United States has shown that nicotine-based pesticides are present in plants' nectar and attack bees' immune sytems . However the decline of bees is complex, and experts say habitat destruction, mites and disease are also important. Tim Lovett of the British Beekeepers Association said improving the pesticides may be better than a blanket ban. He said: ‘This is very interesting and the authors are right to point out that it demands attention from regulatory bodies. There is a link there but a ban may mean we may use other pesticides which are even worse, the evidence has to be looked at carefully.’ Bayer shed doubt on the findings, saying results the lab may not relate to conditions in the open air. A spokesman said focusing on pesticides ignored the bigger issues of mites, and disease. The French government restricted use of neo-nicotinoids but bee populations remained low.",US study shows latest nicotine-based sprays attack insects' immune systems .

A teenage Michelle Obama look-alike got a surprising shout out from the first lady herself. 15-year-old Jada Campbell of Beachwood, Ohio is a big fan of Michelle Obama and has been told she looks and acts like her. So Jada sent a few pictures of herself to Mrs Obama herself, asking what she thought. Resemblance: Jada Campbell sent three pictures of herself channeling the first lady's style, and was surprised to receive a message back from Mrs Obama . 'I just sent her a picture. I had on a dress like she would wear and I said do I sort of have your style in this pic and she said yeah,' Jada told Action News 19. But Jada was surprised when Mrs Obama responded to the pictures in a video recorded for People magazine. 'I was like wow, because I didn't know she was actually going to do a video and say my name. So that was a big shock,' Jada says. In the video, Mrs Obama answers readers' questions while abroad in Africa, and Jada was one of the readers selected. What a compliment: Mrs Obama responded to Jada's pictures, telling the teenager that she looked 'gorgeous' and that they were 'sisters' in power and leadership . 'I saw your picture, you are gorgeous. And, to the extent that anyone compares you to me, I am flattered,' Mrs . Obama said. 'As long as you are working as hard on the inside as you are . on the outside, then I take the compliment.' Following in the first lady's footsteps: Jada attended the inauguration in January . Mrs Obama had a few more words of wisdom for the young girl. 'You and me, we're sisters in power, leadership - you and me, Jada. Change the world. I expect big things from you,' the first lady said. It looks like Jada is already on the right track. She is part of a young scholars program at Warrensville High School, which means if she keeps her grades up she'll get a free ride to Ohio State University. Jada wants to to be a plastic surgeon. 'I'm absolutely proud of my daughter that Michelle Obama responded back to her. She has been great encouragement,' Jada's mother Wanda said. Jada - who attended the inauguration in January - hopes to one day go back to Washington and meet Mrs Obama, the president and their daughters in person.","Jada Campbell, 15, send three pictures of herself to Michelle Obama, asking the first lady if she channeled her style .

A new anti-wrinkle cream, said to be so effective it has convinced women not to have cosmetic surgery, has gone on sale in the U.S. this month. During tests, ANEW Clinical Pro Line Eraser Treatment was said to have reduced the signs of ageing in just seven days. Avon, which is selling the cream for $40, says it contains an ingredient that boosts production of collagen and elastin, which give skin its youthful plumpness and elasticity.

Historic: The Rubicon passed into history after it was crossed by the army of Julius Caesar, pictured . The Rubicon has been one of the world's most famous rivers ever since Julius Caesar crossed it with his army in 49 BC and triggered a Roman civil war. But despite its prominent place in history, no one is actually sure where the river is, with three waterways each suggested as a possible candidate for the ancient Rubicon. Now the long-running historical battle is due to be settled for good, as three local historians present their cases at a mock trial in front of a judge. It is not disputed that the river runs from the Apennine mountains down to the Adriatic sea in the Emilia-Romagna region in north-east Italy. 'Crossing the Rubicon' has been a metaphor for an important and irreversible decision ever since Caesar took his army over the river from Gaul, starting a war against Pompey which would leave him victorious and pave the way for the Roman Empire. In recent years the phrase has been used by figures as diverse as David Cameron, who deployed it last year to warn of the dangers of Press regulation, and Mick Jagger, who sang it in the Rolling Stones' 2005 single Streets of Love. However, the river itself lost its political importance in the reign of Emperor Augustus, who abolished its status as Italy's northern frontier, and for centuries it faded into relative obscurity. Due to frequent flooding of the plains around the Rubicon, the river frequently changed its course and it became unclear which of three waterways it was. Is this it? This bridge over the River Fiumicino is believed by some to have been the crossing used by Caesar . The moment: An artist's impression of Caesar leading his army across the river on the march to Rome . Renaissance historians considered the claims of the Pisciatello, Fiumicino and Uso rivers, and an ancient map called the Tabula Peutingeriana convinced many that the Fiumicino was the true Rubicon. In 1933, fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who was intent on harnessing the country's Roman legacy to bolster his own power, made this judgment official, issuing a decree which changed the name of the Fiumicino to the Rubicone. But on Saturday the debate start up . again in the town of San Mauro Pascoli as three historians each press . the case for their own local river, according to the Guardian. Journalist . and former MP Giancarlo Mazzuca will insist that the question has . already been answered, and that historians have long regarded the . Fiumicino as the right answer. 'This . history is often overlooked due to the fact that the person who gave . this order was Benito Mussolini,' he wrote in a preview for the event. Mystery: There are three main candidates for the location of the historical Rubicon . Proverbial: The phrase 'crossing the Rubicon' has been used by the likes of Mick Jagger and David Cameron . However, teacher Paolo Turroni will claim that the Pisciatello is the real Rubicon, pointing out that evidence from official maps and the works of the author Giovanni Boccaccio point towards it. 'There was no definitive proof,' he said. 'The debate, which had been going on for centuries, was still open. 'In reality, Mussolini had political reasons for doing what he did.' The case for the Uso will be presented by archaeologist Cristina Ravara Montebelli, who plans to rely on the presence of Roman ruins in the area as proof. The debate will be judge by Gianfranco Miro Gori, president of the local business association, who insists that the fiery arguments are all good-natured and have never undermined relations between neighbours.","Three rivers in north-east Italy each claim to be the historical Rubicon .

While in Canada on a trip that had been awarded by a seemingly genuine travel company the pensioners were given new suitcases as part of their prize - unaware that the bags contained a total of 7kg of methamphetamine in rock form that had been loaded by a drug-running syndicate. Police in Australia said today that the elaborate scam was being operated by a bogus Canadian-based travel company whose website targeted elderly Australian couples, offering them the chance to win an all-expenses trip across the Pacific. Bags of meth: After their week-long holiday the man, aged 72, and his 64-year-old wife became concerned about their new bags when they arrived back at the airport in Perth.

Torrential rain has led to unprecedented flooding in the West Yorkshire market town where businesses have been ruined and homes evacuated three times since June 23. Third time unlucky: A cyclist struggles along a street that has become a river in Hebden Bridge. Behind him sandbags protect doorways . Not again: The River Calder overflowed, flooding homes and businesses earlier this month . Just the start: Shops in the centre of Hebden Bridge were awash as the rainy weather began last month . Monday night brought more devastation as the River Calder burst its banks. The area is likely to get another soaking later this week. Another week of heavy rain was yesterday predicted for many parts of the UK, triggering 35 flood warnings for today from the Environment Agency. The April to June period in the UK has been the wettest since 1910 with more than 3,000 properties flooded across England and Wales since the start of May. Stranded: Bank staff became trapped inside their branch in the town centre as the floodwaters rose .

Shoring up: Sandbags sits outside a business in . Hebden Bridge while residents help in the . big clear up after floods hit the region again, right . The country is bracing itself for yet . more flooding after the Met Office said the torrential downpours will . continue into tomorrow. Hebden Bridge saw 500 homes and businesses flooded on June 23, following a month’s rain in 24 hours, and again on July 6. Then on Monday 1.5 inches of rain – more than two weeks’ worth – fell in three hours, overwhelming drainage systems. The Met Office yesterday issued another severe weather alert for rain as up to 1.9 inches could fall in the South-West, South-East, Midlands and North-East. The number of homes and businesses in England that could be at risk of flooding will quadruple in the next 20 years if no further steps are taken to prepare for a changing climate, according to the Government’s climate advisers. More than half a million homes will be at risk of ‘significant’ flooding without more investment in defences, the Committee on Climate Change warned. It said building on flood plains has increased by 12 per cent in the past decade, compared to 10 per cent in other areas. The . problem is exacerbated by people – inspired by TV makeover shows – . putting down paving and decking in their gardens, stopping them from . soaking up rainwater, the committee said. Lord . Smith, chairman of the Environment Agency, believes the recent freak . weather – drought followed by non-stop rain – is the type we should . expect more often.

Easy does it: Hebden Bridge residents are still battling to clear up from last month's floods, which affected more than 500 homes and businesses in the area, Todmorden and Mytholmroyd . Impact: Many of the businesses in Hebden Bridge could not reopen for days and some people reported thefts of their sandbags as desperate residents struggled to keep control . Forecasters say the jet stream – a wind which sweeps across the northern hemisphere from west to east – is ‘blocked’, causing Britain to be bombarded with unsettled rainy weather. Dr Peter Stott of the Met Office also pointed to ‘a warmer world containing more atmospheric moisture’, adding: ‘Therefore there’s the potential for heavy rainfall events to become more extreme.’ A poll by npower found half of homeowners have been using their central heating over the past month.","Wettest April to June period in the UK since 1910 with more than 3,000 properties flooded .

Women spend their entire lives fantasising about their wedding day. But few will have had Battersea Power Station's derelict chimneys in mind. The iconic site, which has lain unused for three decades, is set to become the sought-after backdrop for brides and grooms with money to burn in London, developers claim. Idyllic wedding setting? World-class architects Frank Gehry and Lord Foster have been chosen to transform Battersea Power Station and the 39-acre site surrounding it in a development plan to finish in 10 years . In a billion-pound project masterminded by two of the world's top architects, the 1.8million sq ft building will be transformed into a deluxe party-hosting complex, complete with apartments and high streets to keep guests occupied. For couples that have always dreamed of hosting 1,000 guests in the setting that graced Pink Floyd's album cover, their wish could be realised for upwards of £250,000. Sarah Haywood, a bespoke wedding planner, told The Times: 'There are a lot of people in London who have homes here but are not from this country and who like to have very large parties. Mini city: The 1.8million sq ft building will be complete with flats and high streets to keep guests occupied . Magnificent: A bespoke wedding planner said the plan, being unveiled next week, fills a gap in the market . '[People . from] the Middle East own most of London and when they have parties . they have big ones. They really struggle to find large enough venues.' The proposal, which will be unveiled by Battersea Power Station Development Company, is part of a long-term project to rejuvenate the site by its new Malaysian owners. Rob Tincknell, chief executive of Battersea Power Station Development Company, said the development will be 'completely different from anything that currently exists' in London. This week, Frank Gehry, famous for the Guggenheim in Bilbao, and Lord Foster of Thames Bank, who designed The Gherkin, were selected to transform the 39-acre site - with a view to finish in ten years' time. Long-term: The current project is 'phase three'. Phase One, the building of flats, has already finished . Investment: The site's Malaysian owners vow to put at least £1billion into the regeneration of the venue . They are working under the direction of Rafael Vinoly, whose controversial 'Walkie Talkie' skyscraper in . London's financial district made headlines after melting parts of a . Jaguar car parked below with reflected sunlight. 'Our goal is to help create a neighbourhood and a place for people to live that respects the iconic Battersea Power Station while connecting it into the broader fabric of the city,' Gehry said in a statement on Wednesday. His trademark curved surfaces are dotted all over America, but his only British project stands in Dundee. He was commissioned to mastermind the so-called Phase 3 of Battersea Power Station's makeover by the Malaysian consortium that bought the area last year. Vows: Couples will be able to say their vows on the Thames with 1,000 guests for upwards of £250,000 . The owners want the Station, which ceased generating power fifty years ago, to be as famous at the Tate . Pink Floyd: Perhaps Pink Floyd fans will bid for a wedding slot to replicate the band's Animals album cover . The first phase of flats has been sold and construction has started. Work has also begun on replacing the white chimneys with exact replicas. It will feature two residential zones astride a high street with 1,200 homes, a hotel overlooking the power station, shops and restaurants. A design competition will be held to find a partner to help to create a world-class river pier and Jetty. River-bus services will begin next March. The power station's new owners, SP Setia, Sime Darby and the Employees Provident Fund pension fund, want to sell 3,400 homes to help the development hit a value of 8 billion pounds in 15 years' time.

Tibbs Senior Citizen Building in Englewood, New Jersey have been arrested for allegedly setting up a prostitution ring and possessing crack cocaine . The arrests came after many elderly residents at the home complained about drunks and addicts invading the 152-unit building. Many were fearful to leave their rooms, police said. 'Essentially, they were prisoners in . their own building,' Chief Arthur O’Keefe of the Englewood police, told the New Jersey Record. 'I wasn’t going to allow that to continue.' The Englewood Housing Authority, . which manages the property serving disabled and low-income residents . over 62, said they carried out checks on the two residents before they . moved in. They met the income guidelines and passed a criminal background check, an official told The Record. But the residents' concerns sparked an undercover investigation and officials checked surveillance footage to track down the perpetrators. The federally-funded housing agency . cannot afford private security guards for the home, officials said, and instead, residents must contact police if they have any issues. But in light of the findings - where people were afraid to leave their rooms after coming face-to-face with addicts and strangers in the hallways - police patrol the building around the clock. O’Keefe said the police department is . understaffed following injuries to several officers in recent . weeks but that he has no plans to end the patrols at the Tibbs complex. 'I'm not going to allow the seniors to fall victim again,' he said. Parham, who moved to the home in January 2012,  scheduled to appear in Municipal Court in Englewood on Wednesday. Chaney, who has lived there since September 2010, and McDuffie are due in court June 11. Both Parham and Chaney are in the process of being evicted from the home.","James Parham, 75, 'provided prostitutes to his younger neighbors'

Researchers have downloaded Shakespeare's sonnets on to synthetic DNA in a breakthrough that could lead to major advances in computer storage . A genetic storage device has been used to 'download' all 154 of Shakespeare's sonnets on to strands of synthetic DNA. Scientists were then able to decode the information and reproduce the words of the Bard with complete accuracy. The same technique made it possible to store a 26 second excerpt from Martin Luther King's 'I Have A Dream' speech and a photo of the Cambridgeshire laboratory where the work took place. Researchers were also able to turn a copy of Watson and Crick's paper describing the nature of DNA into genetic code. The landmark study paves the way to storing huge amounts of data using the same method evolved by Nature to write the 'Book of Life'. Theoretically, 100million hours of high definition video could be stored in a cupful of DNA - equivalent to every film and TV programme ever created. Unlike magnetic tape, which degrades within a decade, DNA is a hardy material that can last for tens of thousands of years. A DNA archive also requires no constant supply of electric power, as do hard disks. For their experiment, the British scientists employed a California-based company to create strands of artificial DNA that corresponded to their coding instructions. The end result was a small test-tube the size of a little finger containing a tiny amount of dry dusty material. This was the DNA, which was then 'read' and decoded to reproduce the original files. Details of the technique are described today in the journal Nature. Five genetic 'letters' from the genetic code - A,C,G and T - were used to represent the noughts and ones that make up 'bytes' of digital information. For instance, the upper case T in the word 'Thou' from the second line of Shakespeare's Sonnet XVIII - 'Thou art more lovely and more temperate' - was encoded by the sequence TATAT. Dr Nick Goldman, from the European Bioinformatics Institute at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, said: 'We already know that DNA is a robust way to store information because we can extract it from bones of woolly mammoths, which date back tens of thousands of years, and make sense of it. Currently data centres such as Google's shown here, rely on traditional hard drives. However, they could one day be replaced by the DNA drives revealed today . 'It's also incredibly small, dense and does not need any power for storage, so shipping and keeping it is easy. 'We've created a code that's error tolerant using a molecular form we know will last in the right conditions for 10,000 years, or possibly longer. 'As long as someone knows what the code is, you will be able to read it back if you have a machine that can read DNA.' The scientists crossed a major hurdle by incorporating 'error correction' similar to that found in devices such as laptops and mobile phones. This involved overlapping short strands of DNA and independently writing every million-molecule fragment of code four times. Effectively, three back ups were created for each fragment, greatly reducing the chances of mistakes. 'You would have to have the same error on four different fragments for it to fail - and that would be very rare,' said co-author Dr Ewan Birney, also from the European Bioinformatics Institute. Currently the technology is restricted by the length of time it takes to sequence DNA and its high cost - around £8,000 per megabyte of stored material. Even so, DNA-based storage could today be cost effective for archives of several megabytes over long time periods of 600 to 5,000 years, computer models predict. Ten years from now the rapid development of more efficient, cheaper DNA sequencing could make genetic storage a practical possibility for archive life spans of less than 50 years, say the scientists. They stressed that the DNA used was wholly artificial and different to the genetic molecules of life. 'The DNA we've created cannot be incorporated accurately into the genome (genetic code),' said Dr Goldman. 'It uses a completely different code.'","Same technique also used to store 26 second excerpt from Martin Luther King's 'I Have A Dream' speech .

Charged: David Renz allegedly stabbed a mother to death as she tried to attack him after he raped her 10-year-old daughter . A pedophile who raped a ten-year-old girl before stabbing her mother to death after he cut off his electronic monitoring bracelet pleaded guilty today to murder and sex charges. David Renz, 29, from New York, admitted in county court that he carjacked the two on March 14, stabbing and strangling the mother to death as she tried to stop him from raping her daughter. Renz had been under federal monitoring after a child pornography charge and a federal judge was sharply critical of the way probation officers failed to keep track of him. Renz, 29, pleaded guilty to state charges of first-degree murder and sexual assault against a child. He was expected to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but the plea bargain can be withdrawn if the federal government seeks the death penalty. His lawyer did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Authorities say Renz attacked the woman, a school librarian, and her daughter after they left a gymnastics class at a mall in the Syracuse suburb of Clay. Police said he used an air pistol to force the woman to drive he car to a remote section of the mall's parking lot, where he bound both of them and raped the girl. Perp walk: The attack happened two or three weeks after Renz acquired cable ties and an air pistol they said was used to threaten the woman into stopping in a suburban Syracuse mall parking lot . Prosecutors say Renz was trying to . use cable ties to bind the woman to a headrest in her car when she . fought back and shouted for the girl to bolt from the vehicle. As the girl ran off and was rescued . by a passing motorist, her mother was strangled and repeatedly stabbed . in the head and chest, officials said. Renz was captured by police . shortly after. The woman has not been identified to protect the identity of the girl. Hours before the attack, Renz removed . and quickly reassembled an electronic bracelet so monitors didn't . immediately realize he'd taken it off, authorities said. He was ordered to wear the device as a . condition for being released from jail after his arrest in January on . federal child pornography charges. Weeks after the attack, a report by a . federal judge found that the officers failed to do monthly checks on . Renz that would have included inspection of the bracelet. Federal . probation officers Syracuse who were monitoring Renz were fired or . demoted.

Crime scene: New York State Police investigate a car involved in a fatal carjacking on Verplank Road, Clay, N.Y . Onondaga County District Attorney . William Fitzpatrick said some child porn Renz possessed included scenes . similar to the attack on the mother and child. After . stopping the car, Renz ordered the woman to drive to a remote part of . the parking lot where he bound both victims' hands with cable ties and . raped the child, Fitzpatrick said. Renz . then drove them a short distance until the car got stuck in a snow . bank, prosecutors said. It was there, they said, that he tried to . restrain the mother and the child escaped, looking back to see her . mother had gotten out of the car and was being chased by Renz. A . passing motorist found the girl and alerted police who caught Renz . nearby after a foot chase. Fitzpatrick said Renz had the woman's car . keys and blood on his clothes matched that of the child. A federal grand jury indicted him earlier this year on one count of receiving and five counts of possessing child pornography. An FBI investigation led to the charges that he downloaded the pornography featuring young girls over the course of two years and had five DVDs and CDs, according to the indictment.","David Renz carjacked a mother and daughter in a Syracuse, New York, parking lot .

'According to figures published by a major tech provider, the Internet carries 1,826 Petabytes of information per day.

'In every case, NSA does not and will not use a relationship with a foreign intelligence service to ask that service to do what NSA is itself prohibited by law from doing. 'These partnerships are an important part of the US and allied defense against terrorists, cyber threat actors, and others who threaten our individual and collective security.

The document was released on the same day that President Obama held a news conference about possible surveillance reforms . In defense of its Internet-monitoring program, the NSA writes that the program was created in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, when the NSA 'did not have the tools or the database to search to identify [terorrist] connections and share them with the FBI.' The paper concludes by stating that NSA personnel must report when they suspect the agency is overreaching or not acting within the law. 'This self-reporting is part of the culture and fabric of NSA,' the document reads. 'We do not need to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of national security; both are integral to who we are as Americans. NSA can and will continue to conduct its operations in a manner that respects both.' Below are excerpts from the NSA's seven-page document on Internet surveillance programs: . 'The National Security Agency: Missions, Authorities, Oversight and Partnerships . 'In the wake of recent unauthorized disclosures about some of our key intelligence collection programs, President Obama has directed that as much information as possible be made public, while mindful of the need to protect sources, methods and national security. Acting under that guidance, the Administration has provided enhanced transparency on, and engaged in robust public discussion about, key intelligence collection programs undertaken by the NationalSecurity Agency (NSA). 'This is important not only to foster the kind of debate the President has called for, but to correct inaccuracies that have appeared in the media and elsewhere. This document is a step in that process, and is aimed at providing a succint description of NSA's mission, authorities, oversight and partnerships. 'Prologue . 'After the al-Qa'ida attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the 9/11 Commission found that the U.S. Government had failed to identify and connect the many ""dots"" of information that would have uncovered the planning and preparation for those attacks. 'We now know that 9/11 hijacker Khalid al-Midhar, who was on board American Airlines flight 77 that crashed into the Pentagon, resided in California for the first six months of 2000. While NSA had intercepted some of Midhar's conversations with persons in an al-Qa'ida safe house in Yemen during that period, NSA did not have the U.S. phone number or any indication that the phone Midhar was using was located in San Diego. 'NSA did not have the tools or the database to search to identify these connections and share them with the FBI. Several programs were developed to address the U.S. Government's need to connect the dots of information available to the intelligence community and to strengthen the coordination between foreign intelligence and domestic law enforcement agencies. 'Background . 'NSA's challenge in an increasingly interconnected world - a world where our adversaries make use of the same communications systems and services as Americans and our allies - is to find and report on the communications of foreign intelligence value while respecting privacy and civil liberties. 'We do not need to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of national security - both are integral to who we are as Americans. NSA can and will continue to conduct its operations in a manner that respects both. 'The Essential Role of Foreign Partners .

In every case, NSA does not and will not use a relationship with a foreign intelligence service to ask that service to do what NSA is itself prohibited by law from doing.

The foster-mother, who already has two children with her husband, said she had always been skeptical about women claiming they didn't know they were pregnant - until it happened to her. Scroll down for video: . Trish Staine gave birth to her daughter just five minutes after she was told she was pregnant . Shock: Trish Staine with new daughter Mira, or Miracle, who made her unexpected arrival on Monday . Medical staff believe the baby, who was born at 3.25pm on Monday, arrived about five weeks early. Mrs Staine, who had been training for the Grandma's half-marathon on June 22, said she experienced no pregnancy symptoms and her husband, John, had also had a vasectomy. 'I didn't gain any weight. I . had my period. I had no idea,' she told WDIO. When she went into labor on Monday, she thought she had hurt her back while training on a hill in Glenwood. It wasn't until the pain became severe that she was taken by ambulance to St Mary's hospital. 'In the ER, they found a fetal . heartbeat. I was like, ""No no no. There's no way I'm pregnant"". But they . rushed me up to the birthing center, and five minutes after I got into . my room, she was born,' Mrs Staine said. New addition: Mira will have a host of older siblings to play when she comes home from hospital . Expanding family: Foster carer John Staine could not believe it when doctors said his wife had just had a baby . Her daughter, who has been named Mira, short for Miracle, weighed 6lb 6oz and, although her blood sugar was low, she was healthy. Mr Staine, a Navy veteran who has three sons from a previous relationship, first heard that he was a father again when he arrived at the hospital. When doctors told him he had a daughter, he said: 'Whose baby is that? It’s not possible,' Mr Staine told Duluth News Tribune. However, for every 1,000 vasectomies carried out in the U.S. 11 per cent will fail, resulting in unexpected pregnancies. The new father, who runs the Genesis Project with his wife, which helps young men aged 17 to 21 move from foster care to independent living, said Mrs Staine had been in a lot of pain on Monday. He recalled her crying in pain earlier in the day, but later she was 'screaming, crying and yelling out,' Mr Staine said. Because she had run for about nine miles the previous day, the couple thought she had trapped a nerve, or maybe had a kidney stone. She had taken pain relief, tried soaking her muscles in the bath but the pain became more intense. Finally Mr Staine, 47, who was at a medical center for a health check up, asked their children to get her to a hospital. When he arrived later Mr Staine said that he pinched the doctor who told him his wife had been in labor, adding: 'It was like a dream. I wanted to make sure it was real.' Happy and healthy: Trish Staine cuddles baby Mira, who was born after her mother trained for a half-marathon . He added that Mrs Staine had showed no signs of pregnancy, adding that his wife had even appeared to lose weight as she trained for the marathon. Fortunately, the couple have a large six-bedroom house to accommodate their children and foster children. They started the Genesis Project in 2010 because, as Mr Staine told Lake Voice News: 'If a kid is in trouble and needs a place to stay, something to eat, or a positive view of life, they can come to me.' When asked if his wife would still be running in the half-marathon later this month, he said: 'We paid for [the entry fee]. They’ve already cashed the check.'","Baby 'Miracle' born five minutes after Duluth foster carer arrives at hospital .

"By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 20:32 EST, 9 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:32 EST, 9 August 2013 . Criticism: Health minister Dan Poulter has spoken out against the 'no cuddling' policies which are in place at many nurseries . A minister last night called on nurseries to scrap controversial kiss and cuddle bans imposed to protect them from abuse allegations - saying they were putting children's development at risk. Dr Dan Poulter, the children's health minister, demanded nurseries review 'heavy-handed and draconian' policies which mean thousands of toddlers are spending whole days in childcare without any comfort from staff. He said it was 'extraordinary and alarming' that staff are threatened with the sack for attempting to comfort children distraught because they are missing their parents or because they have grazed their knee. The minister, who also works as a hospital doctor in women's and children's health, said such policies were 'damaging to a child's health, wellbeing, and future life chances'. The Daily Mail revealed earlier this week that an increasing number of nurseries were imposing bans on staff kissing children in the wake of the conviction of paedophile nursery worker Vanessa George. An investigation has found that others instruct staff not to cuddle toddlers, or let them sit on their laps, for all but the shortest periods - claiming that the simple acts of affection harm the independence of the child. But child development experts say the lack of contact threatens the well-being of children. They warn that denying young children affection can have a devastating impact on their development, their happiness and their stress levels. Dr Poulter called on nurseries who had introduced such policies to urgently review their rules. 'It is a natural human instinct to comfort a distressed child, to hold out a hand if they fall, to reassure them if they are crying; physical contact is an important part of that,' he said. 'The blanket ""no contact"" approach being taken by some nurseries is extraordinary and alarming; there is increasingly strong evidence to suggest that a lack of emotional support and physical reassurance from parents and carers during the early years can be damaging to a child's health, wellbeing, and future life chances,' Dr Poulter said. He said the fear of abuse accusations had led some nurseries to draw up policies which were now so 'draconian and heavy-handed' that children were being denied basic care. 'Of course it is right for nurseries to properly vet the backgrounds of all staff looking after children, but comforting a child that has hurt itself is part and parcel of good childcare,' he said. Development: Contact between children and their carers is important for their well-being (picture posed by models) The findings of the investigation by daynurseries.co.uk, an online directory of nursery schools, reopened the debate about whether nurseries are the best place to bring up children. Penny Tassoni, president of the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, said: 'It is actually the duty of anyone working with young children to offer physical contact. 'Young children who are not with their parents are likely to produce a stress hormone known as cortisol. Having access to a hug or even holding a hand of a key person can help to reduce anxiety. 'Policies that are draconian in terms of not allowing children to be reassured are not fit for purpose as they ignore children's right to being nurtured.' The policy of Twinkle Star Day Nursery in Portsmouth says: 'Children are encouraged to be independent; therefore prolonged periods of cuddling and sitting on practitioners' laps is discouraged. Kissing children is forbidden and may result in a disciplinary.' In Barnstaple, North Devon, Ladybirds Day Nursery's policy says: 'While some contact is unavoidable (nappy changing and toilet training), there are other activities, often instigated by the children themselves, that we explain is not appropriate. 'This includes any form of kissing on cheek, forehead or lips when a parent is not present.' One nursery manager said: 'I tell my staff not to kiss children and explain the reasons for it, to protect them from any allegations. Children naturally come to you for a kiss and a cuddle, and we always turn to the side so that they can kiss our cheeks. 'I don't even kiss my own daughter while in nursery.' During discussions about the issue, one parent said: 'The thought of a small baby in a nursery going all day without a kiss from someone makes me quite sad.' Sarah Steel, managing director of the Old Station Nursery chain, said cuddles were important for young children. 'All the evidence around attachment theory and the guidance in the Early Years' Foundation Stage supports close physical contact with the youngest children and the importance of contact for all children,' she said. 'A good, confident practitioner would know exactly what was appropriate, and less experienced staff need to have good role models.'","Dr Dan Poulter MP criticises hands-off policies at many nurseries .

Mother-of-two Mrs Bruce, 38, thinks . the cat may have been mummified by a previous owner, who wanted to ward . off evil spirits - and now believes the dead animal is bringing them . good luck. She said: ‘It’s not leaving the house. Everyone says the house has a lovely feel to it.

New fathers will be made to take a month off work under a ‘use it or lose it’ paternity leave policy adopted by the Liberal Democrats. Nick Clegg’s party wants the UK to follow Scandinavia, where fathers are made to play a bigger role in childcare. Under the plans, to be published today, fathers would be made to take a four-week block of paid leave in the first year of a baby’s life, or lose their entitlement altogether. A Lib Dem policy paper on ‘work/life balance’ says: ‘Government should improve the affordability, quality, convenience and provision of childcare by introducing a use-it-or-lose it “Daddy Month” based on the Swedish model, to encourage uptake of parental leave among fathers.’ New fathers, like Prince William, could soon be made to take a four-week block of paid leave in the first year of a baby¿s life, or lose their entitlement altogether, under new Lib Dem plans . In Sweden, fathers must take two months of paternity leave, paid at 80 per cent of their usual salary. At present in the UK, new fathers can take one or two weeks of paternity leave when their child is born, paid at just £136.78 a week. Prince William has taken his two weeks of leave following the birth of Prince George. Ministers have already announced that from 2015, both parents will be able to share 18 months of parental leave. But the Lib Dem plan would double the fixed amount available specifically for men when their children are born to a full month, but insist that they take it all in one go or lose their entitlements altogether. Nick Clegg¿s party wants the UK to follow Scandinavia, where fathers are made to play a bigger role in childcare . A party spokesman said: ‘The Liberal Democrats are making life easier and fairer for parents by allowing them to share 18 months of parental leave when they have a baby. ‘We believe men and women have equal rights when it comes to working and raising children. As it stands, a father gets two weeks of parental leave on a “use it or lose it” basis. This policy paper proposes double that.’ A working group led by Baroness Tyler of Enfield, the vice-president of counselling service Relate, came up with the policy motion as part of a larger work-life balance policy. The policy paper will be debated at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow next month and is expected to form a key plank of the party’s election manifesto in 2015. Business groups will react with alarm at the proposals, which many believe are unaffordable. And Laura Perrins of the group Mothers at Home Matter, said: ‘This sounds like another example of liberal dictatorship. Politicians should leave it for families to decide who cares for their children. ‘The majority of mothers want to stay at home themselves. Mums and dads are not just interchangeable car engines for their kids. 'Mums give very special care, particularly to young children.’ But equality campaigners say the move will stop women of child-bearing age being seen as a ‘liability’ to employers by transferring some of the burden of childcare to men. Campaigners believe nudging fathers to take more time off is good for families as it makes them become more involved in their children’s lives.

The dollar has nearly hit an eight-month low and stocks dropped this morning as the government shutdown enters into its second week with no end in sight. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have not shown any indication that they will be willing to compromise in order to call off the shutdown and approve the debt-ceiling increase. Republican House Speaker John Boehner vowed on Sunday not to raise the U.S. debt ceiling without a 'serious conversation' about what is driving the debt, while Democrats said it was irresponsible and reckless to raise the possibility of a U.S. default. Setting terms: Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner said that he would not agree to raise the debt limit until he met with President Obama and had a 'serious conversation' about the cause . Erratic: Since the shutdown on Monday evening, the S&P has gone through troubling hurdles that will only get worse should the government get closer to defaulting on our debt . The United States faces a deadline of October 17 to raise its $16.7trillion debt limit or risk an unprecedented debt default. The two issues of emergency funding for the government to operate and increase the U.S. borrowing authority started out separately in the House but have been merged by the pressure of time. The dollar fell, hovering near an eight-month low against a basket of major trading currencies, and crude oil prices slipped as the government shutdown and looming fight over the debt ceiling clouded the economic outlook. 'Last week investors were hopeful that the government shutdown would be short-lived in nature,' said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions. 'Now that it's entering its second week, investors are growing a bit more edgy and that's being played out in weaker world stocks and the dollar staying on the defensive.' Bleak: Chinese officials spoke out as their country holds the majority of U.S. Treasury bonds, warning the U.S. should not make another mistake like the one that led to the S&P downgrade . The S&P 500 .SPX has fallen for two straight weeks and is down nearly 3 per cent from its all-time high of 1,725.52 on concerns about the effect of Washington dysfunction on the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 149.44 points which is 0.99 percent and the Nasdaq  dropped 30.381 points or 0.8 per cent. Equities investors were unnerved by the apparent hardening of stances over the weekend. U.S. stocks opened sharply lower on Monday and European shares fell to a four-month low. In comments on Sunday television political talk shows, neither Republicans nor Democrats offered any sign of impending agreement on either the shutdown or the debt ceiling, and both blamed the other side for the impasse. 'I'm willing to sit down and have a conversation with the president,' said Boehner, speaking on ABC's 'This Week.' But, he added, President Barack Obama's 'refusal to negotiate is putting our country at risk.' On CNN's 'State of the Union' program, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said: 'Congress is playing with fire,' adding that Obama would not negotiate until 'Congress does its job' by reopening the government and raising the debt ceiling.

'The United States is totally clear about China's concerns about the fiscal cliff,' Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said in the Chinese government's first public comment on the October 17 deadline. 'We hope the United States fully understands the lessons of history,' Zhu told reporters in Beijing, referring to the downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's in 2011.

Two policeman accused of lying to MPs over the ‘Plebgate’ affair involving former Tory Minister Andrew Mitchell will be forced to make grovelling public apologies in the Commons on Tuesday. Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones, who are accused of ‘stitching up’ Mitchell, were told by MPs yesterday they will be found guilty of contempt of Parliament if they refuse. MPs could, in theory, use their historic power to imprison the pair, though in practice that is highly unlikely. Denial: Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton (left) said he did not call Theresa May 'that woman' and Sergeant Chris Jones has been subject to 13 complaints . The humiliation follows the publication today of a damning report into the police handling of ‘Plebgate’. Mr Mitchell was accused of calling a policeman a ‘f****** pleb’ when he declined to let him cycle through the gates at No 10. The report by the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee effectively accuses police of a conspiracy to cover up the way they lied in a successful bid to force Mr Mitchell’s resignation from the Cabinet. The bombshell report accuses ‘mendacious’ Det Sgt Hinton of lying by denying he referred to Home Secretary Theresa May as ‘that woman’. It also claims Sgt Jones lied by saying he had not been involved in disciplinary inquiries in the past – police have now admitted there had been 13 complaints against him. The publication Lambasts the three chief constables who handled the complaint for a ‘lack of leadership’. Two . chief constables were also critcised for failing to launch a . disciplinary probe into the conduct of Hinton and Jones, who, together . with a third Police Federation representative, Ken MacKaill, were . accused of plotting to get Mitchell sacked. Last . night, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) watchdog . ordered a new inquiry into the three policemen. In a statement Home . Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘We were appalled by the . evidence given by Det Sgt Hinton, Sgt Jones and Inspector MacKaill. It . is now clear Hinton and Jones misled the committee, possibly . deliberately. In the firing line: Chief Constables Chris Sims, left, David Shaw, centre, and Andy Parker are accused of failing to carry out a thorough investigation . ‘We have recalled them to correct the record and if they do not, they will be in prima facie contempt of Parliament.’ Insp MacKaill could also be hauled before Parliament if there was evidence he had misled the committee. Mr Vaz added: ‘Instead of being transparent, we have uncovered a process that obstructs the truth. If this can happen to a Cabinet Minister, what hope is there for anyone else?’ The MPs report follows the row over a meeting last October between Mr Mitchell and the Police Federation as he fought to save his Cabinet seat after the incident at the Downing Street gates. MacKaill, Hinton and Jones were accused of deliberately misrepresenting what Mr Mitchell said at the meeting. Tory MPs claim it played a  large part in Mr Mitchell losing his job as Chief Whip days  later – and was part of a Police Federation campaign against government cuts in the  police force. The MPs say Hinton’s denial when quizzed by MPs that he had referred to Mrs May as ‘that woman’ was ‘mendacious when he has subsequently informed us the woman referred to must be the Home Secretary’. Forced out: Ex-Minister Andrew Mitchell resigned after the incident at Downing Street . Hinton has apologised in writing to MPs – but the committee wants him to say sorry to them in person on Tuesday. Sgt Jones is savaged for not owning up to having been the subject of 13 disciplinary complaints when he gave evidence to MPs. They said: ‘It is a serious matter to mislead a parliamentary committee.’ Hinton, Jones and MacKaill are denounced for their ‘stubborn and unashamed refusal’  to apologise to Mr Mitchell. The three chief constables in the firing line are David Shaw (West Mercia), Chris Sims (West Midlands) and Andy Parker (Warwickshire) who were accused of failing to carry out a thorough investigation. ‘There was an absence of leadership by all three chief constables at a critical time,’ say the MPs. IPCC deputy chairman Deborah Glass last night ordered a new misconduct probe by the IPCC itself into the three Police Federation men. She said the ‘catalogue of irregularities’ had undermined public confidence. She added: ‘The only investigation that would satisfy the public interest and maintain confidence in the police is an independent one, carried out by the IPCC’s own staff, and this is what will now take place.’","Stuart Hinton and Chris Jones are accused of 'stitching up' the ex-minister .

The baby mama of New York Yankees star second baseman Robinson Cano, 31, has spoken out to demand more child-support and her lawyer claims the star currently spends more on his dogs than on his three-year-old son. Jackelin Castro, 39, is the mother of Cano’s three-year-old son, Robinson Miguel Cano Castro. They live in Cano’s home country of the Dominican Republic. She has accused the Yankees star of paying too little and too erratically towards his son’s upkeep. New York Yankees star Robinson Cano, 31, has been accused of neglecting the upkeep of his three-year-son son who lives in the Dominican Republic with the baseball player's ex-girlfriend . Jackelin Castro and Cano's 3-year-old son, Robinson Miguel Cano Castro, live together in the Dominican Republic . Cano and Castro, who were a couple between 2008 and 2011, are currently embroiled in a child-support dispute. She claims Cano had a lawyer come to her home in February to try and get her to agree to accept $600 a month over the next 10 years, which she refused. ‘The intention of him and his advisers was somewhat to intimidate me,’ Castro told ESPN.com. Cano, who made $15 million last season, has disputed the mother’s claims in a statement. Jackelin Castro, 39, claims Cano sent a lawyer to her home to try to get her to agree to accepting $600 a month child support for his son . ‘I have gone above and beyond to care . for my child including an agreed upon monthly stipend, a house, a car, . insurance, school and other essentials for the baby and his mother as . well many other things including toys and clothing,’ he said. ‘This . is a private matter and I will not fight it in the media, nor will I . say anything disparaging about the mother of my child or comment any . further. I look forward to an amicable resolution that will allow me . time with my son.’ Castro has complained the Cano’s $600 a month payments are delivered sporadically by a relative and without notice. Her lawyer Wendy Diaz is demanding $25,000 a month. ‘I believe the money he gives to the son, when he does, is not enough to feed the dogs of Robinson Cano’s house,’ Diaz said. ‘Maybe he is expending more money on the dogs and cars that he has than on his own child.’ The pair are scheduled back in court on Nov. 7. Cano's ex-girlfriend has also attacked the public image that he conveys through his RC24 Foundation, which helps underserved children . Castro also attacked Cano’s public image that he conveys through his RC24 Foundation, which helps underserved children. ‘What hurts me most [is] he shows the world that he helps children, that he's a good person, he's very humane,’ she said. ‘So with something of his own, he may trick the world and everybody who sees him because he's the big star that he is, but there's a reality, which is a son who doesn't [receive] the quality of life he's supposed to.’ At the same time as Cano is fighting the child-support dispute, his advisers are preparing to seek a big money free-agent contract which could increase his salary yet further. If all goes as planned, the five-time All-Star will sign a multi-year deal with the New York Yankees or another team this winter.","Robinson Cano, 31, is of neglecting the upkeep of his three-year-son son who lives in the Dominican Republic .

The Argentine ambassador in London has accused the UK of violating international law in its 'arrogant' approach to the case of Julian Assange. Alicia Castro, who only took up her post earlier this year, said the diplomatic handling of attempts to extradite the Wikileaks founder showed similarities to the UK's attitude to the Falkland Islands. A former air stewardess and union official, Ms Castro is known for her nationalistic stance and is a close confidante of President Cristina Kirchner. Assange has sought political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London . Crowded: Hundreds of supporters, journalists and police officers filled the Knightsbridge street to listen to Assange speak earlier this month . Speaking of the Assange case in an interview with an Argentine radio station, she said: 'For us Argentines, this fact [sic], that shows us the arrogance of British diplomacy, does not surprise us. 'It is very similar to the approach taken toward the Malvinas Islands [the Argentine name for the Falklands]. London is being urged by the United Nations to negotiate and participate in dialogue with Argentina.' Outspoken: Argentina ambassador Alicia Castro is well know for her nationalistic stance . Ms Castro added that by allegedly threatening to seize Assange from Ecuador's London embassy, the UK was 'violating international law' and said the Organisation of American States had joined together to 'defend international law against the British challenge.' A diplomatic row developed between the UK and Ecuador after the South American nation granted asylum to Mr Assange, who faces extradition to Sweden to face trial over alleged sexual offences. He denies any wrongdoing and took refuge in Ecuador's embassy, saying he fears being extradited to the US in connection with the publication of leaked diplomatic cables by Wikileaks. William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, has said the UK is 'determined to carry out our legal obligation' to have Assange extradited to Sweden. Rafael Correa, the president of Ecuador, accused the UK of indicating it would enter Ecuador's embassy to arrest Assange but later said the UK had 'given up on its threat'. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has said Assange would be arrested if he left the embassy but insisted that no threats have been made against the embassy. Row: Castro likened Britain's policy on Assange to their diplomatic strategy over the Falkland Islands (pictured) Ms Castro also revealed that she met Assange at the embassy with other Latin American leaders last Friday while listening to a live transmission from Washington of a meeting of foreign ministers from the OAS to discuss the inviolability of embassy and consular premises. 'We were sitting looking at the debate when Assange turned up and shook hands with all the ambassadors and diplomatic representatives and stayed on for quite some time,' she said. 'He talked with several of us while following the OAS debate.' Argentina had left the post of ambassador to the UK vacant since 2008 before Ms Castro's arrival in London in March in protest at the UK's refusal to be drawn into discussions over the sovereignty of the Falklands.",Outspoken ambassador compares British stance on Assange to row with Falklands .

Those worried about the long-term health of A-list actresses such as Renée Zellweger, who famously lost and gained weight twice for her Bridget Jones role, should spare a thought for the boys, too. After shedding almost 2st  last year as he slimmed down from being a muscle-bound Thor to star in Rush, the movie about trim British racing driver James Hunt, Chris Hemsworth has been asked  to lose the pounds again for his new film  called Heart Of The Sea. He may seem in peak condition now, but could these extreme regimes increase the risk of serious illness in later life? 'Chris and I both have to lose as much weight as possible over the next month,' says his co-star Joseph Mawle, who is best known for his role as Benjen Stark in Game Of Thrones. Chris Hemsworth has been asked to lose the pounds again for his new film called Heart Of The Sea . 'We play these guys who are stranded on a boat, so we have to look really worn-down and skinny. It's not a great look, but Chris will still be his handsome self.' Joseph and Chris might heed the warnings of actor Tom Hanks, who ruled out ever again taking film roles that require dramatic body transformations after developing type 2 diabetes. The Captain Phillips  star believes the diagnosis may be connected to him changing his size for roles such as Castaway and A League Of Their Own. While crash-dieting can be damaging due to dehydration and malnutrition, the adverse effect on the body of bouts of weight gain is cumulative. Dr David Haslam, clinical director of the National Obesity Forum, explains: 'In overweight people, if you lose 2st then gain it again, then lose it again and gain it again, the damage is equivalent to gaining 4st on top of whatever you already weighed. The body starts to release chemicals that cause inflammation, which increases the risk of heart disease and possibly diabetes too.' Australian star Hemsworth, 30, will be packing on the protein again soon, though, to play Thor in the next Avengers film. First-born children are 'smarter' than younger siblings, according to the US National Bureau of Economic Research. The results of a survey showed that first children typically get  better grades in school and have higher IQs.

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 17:16 EST, 25 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:47 EST, 25 October 2013 . The mistress of the Mormon doctor accused of killing his wife has revealed how they exchanged 22 text messages with him throughout her funeral. Gypsy Willis began giving her testimony on Friday afternoon and told how her relationship with the married pediatrician progressed from their first interaction online a year before his wife's death to the point where he paid for her apartment, gave her a debit card for spending money and helped pay her nursing school tuition. Willis, who appeared in court as part of a plea deal to get a lesser sentence for felony identity theft charges that she currently faces, tried to downplay the seriousness of her relationship with Martin MacNeill. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE . Out in public: Gypsy Willis testified about how she first met Martin MacNeill when he contacted her through an online interest board that she ran and they began instant messaging . Tense: Martin MacNeill remained expressionless throughout the trial on Friday . She said that they first met when he commented on a post she had published on an website dedicated to her interests, and they struck up an instant messaging conversation that turned into more. While on the stand, she admitted that she had previously lied about how they met, but asserted that this version was the truth. She repeatedly said that even though she lived in a duplex that he controlled the contract to, they kept their sexual relationship very loose after first making contact in November 2005. It became sexual in January 2006- a year and three months before MacNeill's wife Michele was found dead in their bathtub. 'We would see each other about a couple of times a month but there were some months where we didn't see each other,' Willis said in her testimony. 'It was a very casual thing.' She said that she was still seeing other people while maintaining this relationship with MacNeill and continued that level of seriousness even after she moved into a complex where he had an apartment that was not being used. Looking over the facts: The prosecutor asked Willis to read out the number of texts they exchanged for a wide swath of days during the relationship, including throughout the week that his wife was found dead . Getting ready: Willis, seen walking into court in Provo, Utah on Friday, said that their relationship was very casual and had been sexual for more than a year before his wife was found dead in their family home . Willis was a nursing student at the time, and although part of her tuition was being paid for by financial aid, MacNeill also helped her with the additional payments- though she said in court today that those financial entanglements had no reflection on whether or not their relationship was serious. 'I was still seeing other people, I was . very busy so the fact that i did see him a little more than other . people’ was insignificant. Motives: Willis agreed to testify as part of a plea deal for an ongoing felony identity theft case . After repeatedly saying that she kept things casual with the married father, the prosecutor had her read out an email that she sent on March 7, 2007 to an unnamed potential suitor where she put an end to that man's advances because of MacNeill. In the March 7 email she wrote saying that she could not see the man in question because 'a very good and best friend of mine has become much more than that,' referring to MacNeill. In a follow up to that same man, she expanded on it and said that even though they met online more than a year ago, 'just recently his reasoning and views changed and we are together now'. The prosecutor then went through the log of texts and calls that the pair exchanged, that ranged from anywhere between six and 38 texts in one day- even during the week of April 11, 2007 when Michele was found dead. On that particular day, they exchanged 15 texts, and on April 14 they texted 22 times during Michele's funeral. The majority of the calls were made from MacNeill's office phone while the texts came from his cell- showing that he tried to keep his audible interactions with her hidden while at home with his wife and children. 'This was a very informal, discrete . thing. We were not interested in other people knowing. He was trying to . keep it discrete. I respected that,' Willis said. Asked about the nature of the relationship she added: 'We had sex half the time. Sometimes, it was just lunch.' Friday's . appearance was Gypsy's first time taking the stand in the controversial . murder trial, and she only spoke briefly about the circumstances around . Michele's death. When asked what MacNeill had told her about the way in which his wife had died, she said: 'He found Michele in the bathtub.' 'I didn't chase him for details but I believe she was partially dressed,' she said. Plotted: Prosecutors say MacNeill convinced his wife to get a facelift then drugged her and coaxed her into the tub, where she drowned . Willis recalled two other potentially pivotal details, telling how she remembered an undated anecdote that MacNeill told her about how his wife had recently been told by doctors that she had high blood pressure. Willis also said that on the day of Michele's death, she remembered MacNeill telling her he had called one of his older daughters- Alexis- and asked her to check in on her mother because Michele had seemed 'restless' that morning. The secret lovers became less and less discrete after Michele's death, however, as Gypsy attended her funeral on April 14 and spoke to him briefly immediately after the service in front of family and friends. A tearful Rachel MacNeill, left, and her younger . sister Alexis Somers, right, both testified in court against their . father on Thursday. They both believe he is guilty of killing their mother . Martin MacNeill bows his head and listens to his daughter Rachel MacNeill's emotional testimony during his murder trial on Thursday . She went on to say how some time after the funeral, he 'staged and directed' her first meeting with a few of his daughters at a Mormon temple by making sure she was dressed appropriately and steering the conversation into one about their need for a nanny. In front of his daughter, he asked Gypsy for her phone number- even though he clearly already had it- and arranged for an interview at his house to see if she would be a good fit for the nanny job. Willis, now 37, will return to the stand on Tuesday. The prosecution is trying to prove a case that supports the theory that MacNeill killed his wife by using a combination of drugs following a plastic surgery operation in order to be with his mistress.","Martin MacNeill is accused of killing his wife Michele and making it look like an accidental death as a result of medication from a facelift .

Alarm bells began ringing when party animal Andy wanted to go home early from a night out. ‘His eyes were streaming, he had a headache, cough and said he felt like someone was pressing on his chest.' Pledge: Upon hearing he had terminal cancer, Andy immediately proposed to Kelli. 'He wanted to give me a wedding day because I'd stuck by him through everything,' she says . Kelli insisted he got checked out by a doctor and the news that followed was devastating. On May 15, Andy was diagnosed with stage four (advanced) lung cancer – and doctors feared the disease had spread to his brain. And there was worse to come two weeks later. ‘Our worst fears were confirmed,’ says Kelli. ‘The cancer had spread to the brain and there was nothing they could do.' Andy immediately proposed. ‘In the eight years we were together he had never wanted to get married – he said it was just a bit of paper,' says Kelli. ‘But he immediately decided he wanted to give me a wedding day because I’d stuck by him through everything, so we set about organising everything. Looking back, I wonder if it was almost to distract me from the horror of the situation.’ ‘I felt sad, excited and scared – it was a real mixed bag of emotions.’ Emotional: The date was set for July 6th and Kelli set about organising a small, family wedding. But just 10 days before, doctors said it touch and go as to whether Andy would survive to make it down the aisle . Joy: The wedding, in East Kilbride, was a true reflection of Andy's vivacious personality, says Kelli. 'What was supposed to be to be about 12 people there but there ended up being about 200 - because everyone came to say goodbye' The date was set for July 6th and Kelli set about organising a small, family wedding. But just 10 days before, Andy’s condition deteriorated rapidly - he couldn’t take any food and drink - and doctors warned her it was touch and go as to whether he would survive to make it down the aisle. Unbeknown to her, Andy had told doctors how determined he was – and managed to battle through to the big day. The wedding, in East Kilbride, was a true reflection of Andy’s vivacious personality, she says. ‘What was supposed to be to be about 12 people ended up being about 80 - plus another 200 for the evening! Everyone really came to say goodbye to Andy. ‘We all thought there would be loads of crying and sadness, but it was actually a celebration of his life and the fact he’d made it to the wedding. The couple managed to spend one precious on honeymoon at a spa before returning home, where Andy continued to decline . ‘Andy was his usual hilarious self during the speeches and everyone was howling with laughter.’ The couple then spent one precious night on honeymoon at a spa before returning home, where Andy continued to decline. ‘It got to the point where he could only eat McFlurries because it was so hard to get food down and he needed a cane to walk,’ says Kelli. Goodbye: Andy died on August 6 2012 - a month after the couple's wedding day. Kelli is now fundraising for Macmillan Cancer . ‘But he also became more accepting of his situation. One day, we were sitting on the sofa and he turned to me and said: “I’ve had a good innings, when your time’s up, your time’s up – and mine will be very soon"".' Andy died on August 6 2012 – a month after the couple’s wedding day. ‘That morning he was crying in my arms and he took off his watch and gave it to me for his best friend to wear – he knew it was close.’ Later that day a doctor came and gave Andy painkilling medication. He died that afternoon at home. ‘I remember feeling very sad afterwards that he’d never got a chance to watch the wedding DVD,’ says Kelli. ‘But I’m just so relieved he made it to the big day.’ Now, in an effort to raise money for Macmillan Cancer, Kelli has given up alcohol as part of the Go Sober campaign. ‘I want to give something back to the nurses that made it that little bit easier for us at the end,’ she says. ‘I haven’t had a month sober since I was about 16 and I know that Andy would think it’s hilarious that I’ve signed up to do this.’ For more information go to gosober.org.uk or to donate to Kelli’s fundraising, go to . https://www.gosober.org.uk/profile/kelliyoung .

The special coins, which have been produced by the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, South Wales, go on sale today to mark the christening of the couple's son, Prince George. The design features the Lily Font from the Tower of London and two harp-playing cherubs. Scroll down for video . The coin worth £50,000, which has been struck to commemorate the christening of Prince George of Cambridge at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, South Wales . At the foot of the coin is the royal motto ""Dieu et mon droit"" - God and my right. The £5 coin is available in silver - because the crossing of a baby's palm with silver is said to confer good health and prosperity to newborns - and gold - to commemorate the royal celebration. William and Kate's son will be christened at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace on October 23. Dr Kevin Clancy, director of the Royal Mint Museum, said: ""I think the designer, John Bergdahl, has done an excellent job of giving us something that is timeless. It's symbolic and it's got dignity about it. Both sides of the £50,000 coin, which is part of the first ever set of British coins to commemorate a royal christening was revealed today.

He said the Queen and Chancellor George Osborne had also given the design their approval. Approved by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Her Majesty the Queen and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the coins feature the lily font that plays an important role in Royal christenings . Mr Bergdahl said: ""The design is baroque, a style that has been reborn many times and often featured in royal artwork and traditions. ""One element that I knew I wanted to incorporate was the Lily Font from the Tower of London, which is a strong tradition in christenings for the Royal Family. ""The motto is traditional and sums up the expectation carried by a young child, born to reign - regardless of gender - for the first time ever."" Mr Bergdahl said it normally takes up to two years to produce a new coin, but the christening edition had to be made in around seven months because of the unknown details about the royal baby, such as its gender or name. ""Hopefully it will be timeless and it will still look as good in 100 years' time as it does now,"" he added.

"By . Chris Brooke . PUBLISHED: . 18:33 EST, 25 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:39 EST, 25 October 2013 . On her first night behind bars, Myra Hindley confessed to feeling guilt. Not for the children’s lives she had snuffed out – but for having a ‘disloyal’ dream about her lover and partner in crime Ian Brady trying to strangle her. The Moors murderer’s warped emotions are laid bare from beyond the grave at the start of an unpublished autobiography that drips with self-pity and shows no respect for the suffering of her victims or their grieving relatives. Evil: Murderer Myra Hindley pictured in prison in the 1980s where she attempted to write an autobiography . ‘The sheets were cold and smelling of the laundry, and I tried to fall asleep, but awakened later after having a nightmare which frightened me but filled me with guilt,’ she wrote. ‘I dreamed Ian was trying to strangle me, and I felt terrible, full of guilt for dreaming such a disloyal thing, and I lay there for hours, confused, frightened, and apprehensive.’ The first person account of Hindley’s entry into the prison system after her arrest was intended to be the start of an autobiography. She posted the first four pages, but they were intercepted by the prison authorities and later stored in the National Archives. Today, with her official files no longer classified as secret, it can be read publicly for the first time. No thought for her victims: An extract from the memoir Myra Hindley wrote in prison . In it the woman who was responsible for the shocking murders of five children in the 1960s tells how within a few hours of being booked into Risley Remand Centre in Cheshire on October 11, 1965, she was pining for ‘my boyfriend’ Brady. When a woman prison orderly asked her if there was anything she wanted to know, Hindley ‘couldn’t think of anything except where my boyfriend was. She said he’d be over in the male prison and I could ask the Governor in the morning if I could have visits from him.’ She also complains about the indignities of prison life as she perceives them, all the time without a thought for the misery she had caused or any acknowledgement that she deserved to be punished. Hindley felt ‘annoyed and embarrassed’ about the ‘invasion of privacy’ of being inspected for lice, she wrote, and refused to use a chamber pot because ‘I was determined from the start that I’d cling on to that much of my dignity’. Hindley and Brady pose for a picture on the moor where they buried their child victims . It took 22 years before she put pen to paper to describe these events in her new role as an author. Handwritten by Hindley – complete with meticulous corrections initialled ‘MH’ – on pages torn from an exercise book, the account was titled ‘Risley – Remand’. Believing it would one day be published, she even copyrighted the pages. Describing her first admission to prison Hindley, who died in jail in 2002 aged 60, wrote: ‘I think I was in a state of shock where things don’t register properly. ‘I know I felt relieved that the . uncertainty was over and that I wouldn’t have to be a burden on my . mother and stepfather-to-be, or my uncle and aunt.’She was taken to her cell by a female officer who told her: ‘It’s quite bare but it’s warm and the bed is clean.’ Hindley asked where the toilet was . and was horrified when the warder pointed to a chamber pot under the . bed. ‘I said, “My mother weaned me off that when I was a baby and I’m . not using one of those at my age”.’ She . ‘suffered agonies’ training her body to wait to use the toilet at 8am. It was more than 17 years – after being transferred to Cookham Wood – . before she was given a cell with a toilet. She . and Brady travelled to the remand centre in separate cars after . appearing in court. Hindley was ordered to undress by what she called . the ‘impersonally kind’ reception staff and described the tiny changing . cubicle. ‘We called . them horse boxes. But a horse would never had fitted into that tiny . space. I undressed and handed my clothes out, putting on the huge . nightdress and prison dressing gown given to me, and a pair of old . slippers.’ Asked her religion, ‘I told them – . and it was the first time I’d acknowledged this, not without a thrill of . fear – that I hadn’t got any religion. They put me down as C of E on my . card, which was changed at Holloway to N/R – no religion.’ Trial: Myra Hindley and Ian Brady are seen leaving court in a police van after being sentenced with the Moors Murders . Hindley told how she had felt guilty for having a 'disloyal' dream about her lover and partner in crime Ian Brady trying to strangle her . Hindley was also stunned to be asked if she had false teeth. ‘I thought they were joking but they said some people weren’t above swapping teeth for cigarette ends,’ she wrote. Dr Tom Clark, a Sheffield University academic who is writing a book about Hindley’s life behind bars, found the lost chapter in the National Archives. He said: ‘Overall, it’s a dispassionate and quite detailed account which shows a remarkable memory. But it completely ignores the gravity of what has happened to her.’ A second chapter about her years in Holloway seems likely to remain secret as it names officers and could be defamatory, said Dr Clark. Prison records also suggest a third, and as yet undiscovered, chapter may have been written too. Brady, now 75, is currently held in a psychiatric hospital.","Moors murderer's warped emotions laid bare from beyond the grave .

The footage apparently shows the unnamed officer, who is a veteran of seven years, banging on the window and shattering it before the driver was pulled from the vehicle. The cop then rides away from the scene, sources told NBC. The video, which is being reviewed, is not the same as that which has been widely circulated following the September 29 attack.

The . officer is assigned to the NYPD Intelligence Division, but sources did . not reveal whether he was on assignment or whether his actions were a . ploy to protect his cover. Michael Palladino, president of the NYPD detectives' union, said the undercover officer was forced to make a difficult decision. 'Compromising . his identity could compromise all the work he's doing and his safety as . well,' Palladino told NBC. 'It's very difficult to lead a double life.' The officer now faces an internal investigation because . he didn't inform higher brass that he was with the bikers, let alone . the crime scene, until three days after the attack, the Post said. But . police believe that they cannot press charges against the officer . because another biker, Allen Edwards, 43, who punched the window of . Alexian Lien's Range Rover before he was attacked in front of his wife . and two-year-old daughter, had his charges dropped.

Division, Karen Friedman Agnifilo said that the city cannot chase . everyone involved saying: 'Prematurely charging individuals with . low-level crimes does not further the goals of the investigation and . could weaken the cases we expect to bring against the perpetrators of . serious crimes.' The explosive development came as another biker headed to court over the incident. Craig . Wright, 29, was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday and . ordered held on $100,000 bail, even though his lawyer said he was . innocent. Prosecutors . argued that Wright, from Canarsie, Brooklyn, had been caught on video . stomping of Lien at least three times after he was dragged from the SUV.

Christopher Cruz, pictured here, could face additional charges, police say . Lien . sped off, plowing into a motorcyclist. Bikers chased the SUV, pulled . Lien from his vehicle and began beating him in front of his wife and . two-year-old daughter, police said. Large portions of the September 29 incident were captured on video and posted online. Three . other bikers, including Robert Sims, 35, and Reginald Chance, 37, both . from Brooklyn, have been charged in the incident. Authorities say Sims . is the man captured on video pulling open the door of Lien's SUV, and . that Chance was seen using his helmet to bash in the vehicle's window. Christopher Cruz, faces charges of unlawful imprisonment, reckless endangerment, reckless driving, endangering the welfare of a child and menacing. Police say Cruz triggered the initial confrontation by slowing down his bike and then going to confront Lien after being bumped. Cruz has denied brake-checking Lien and says he was merely trying to exchange driver information. Lien has not been charged. The biker he ran over, Edwin Meises Jr., suffered two broken legs and spinal injuries that his family says will leave him paralyzed.

Lien then struck Cruz's motorcycle. After the collision, Mr Lien then panicked and plowed through the crowd of bikers that stopped around him. Mr Lien called 911 and attempted to flee the bikers, but they chased after him. When he exited the highway and had to stop for traffic, several furious bikers attacked the SUV, pulled Mr Lien and brutally pummeled him - including stomping on his head.

Pilots for budget airline Ryanair have expressed serious concerns about passenger safety – and claim that these are suppressed by bosses. In an internal survey of 1,000 pilots, two-thirds said they did not feel comfortable raising safety issues through the airline’s internal system, while nine out of ten said it did not have an ‘open and transparent safety culture’. It comes just months after three Ryanair planes were forced to make emergency landings in Spain on the same day, when they allegedly started to run out of fuel. Scroll down for video . Taking flight: Three-quarters of Ryanair pilots are reported to be on zero-hours contracts and must pay for all their expenses, including uniforms, identity cards, transport and hotel accommodation . The survey was leaked to Channel 4 for a Dispatches documentary, in which an anonymous pilot claimed employees were scared to speak out to bosses about safety fears. The pilot added: ‘It is really difficult to talk to them and the tone used is really unusual for an airline. It’s usually threats and bullying.’ Three-quarters of Ryanair pilots are reported to be on zero-hours contracts and must pay for all their expenses, including uniforms, identity cards, transport and hotel accommodation. Pilots claim the contracts make them more likely to fly even when they feel unwell, because they do not get sick pay. In the documentary, Ryanair: Secrets From The Cockpit, to be broadcast tonight, one said: ‘About 70 per cent of our pilots, if not more, are on a [zero-hours] contract. They get paid only if they fly. So that’s the pressure.’ In April this year, several hundred pilots signed a petition calling on Irish and European regulators to examine the impact of Ryanair’s employment contracts on safety. It said the ‘confusing, uncertain and unpredictable employment situation’ was causing ‘stress and worry’ for pilots and was becoming ‘an increasing distraction in daily flight operations’. It was met with a stern warning to staff from the airline’s chief pilot Ray Conway, that ‘any Ryanair pilot who participates in this so-called safety petition will be guilty of gross misconduct and will be liable for dismissal’.

Last month, it emerged pilots were ordered to fly more slowly in a bid to save money on fuel after a fall in the airline’s quarterly profit. 'About 70 per cent of our pilots, if not more, are on a [zero-hours] contract. They get paid only if they fly. So that’s the pressure' Ryanair pilot . The latest survey was commissioned by The Ryanair Pilot Group, which represents more than half of the airline’s 2,500 pilots but is not recognised by the company. It found more than half of pilots said the threat to their jobs had made them ‘more reluctant’ to speak out about safety concerns. Two-thirds did not ‘have confidence’ in the safety reporting system, while  94 per cent said Mr Conway’s memo was an attempt to ‘suppress pilots raising concerns’. The vast majority of pilots also claimed bosses failed to provide them with information on previous ‘incidents’ involving Ryanair aircraft. Last year, Ryanair was accused of . operating with a level of fuel that was ‘close to the minimum’ required . in the case of a diversion.

It told the Government that it would move within weeks to phase out the contracts, which allow workers to register themselves as ‘personal service companies’ and be taxed as companies and not individuals.

It is thought that forcing them on to the staff pay roll might mean an effective pay cut of between 10 and 20 per cent. There is no suggestion that any of the individuals named have acted improperly but  MPs accused the BBC of having ‘staggeringly inappropriate’ arrangements in place for many employees and said it could be ‘complicit’ in tax avoidance.

"By . Daniel Bates . PUBLISHED: . 14:48 EST, 9 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:47 EST, 9 October 2013 . The NYPD detective arrested over his alleged role in the gang bike attack on a family in their SUV had worked undercover in the Occupy Wall St movement for two years, it was revealed today. Detective Wojciech Braszczok - who also told activists his real name was 'Al' - shaved his head into a mohawk and apparently pretended to be a biker bro to win the trust of activists. He attended demonstrations and lived like the protestors. He appeared in court today over his involvement with a bike gang that chased down Manhattan father Alexian Lien, 33, and pulled him from his Range Rover in front of his wife and two-year-old child after he allegedly ran over one of his biker buddies. But despite the seriousness of the claims against him, a judge agreed with Braszczok's lawyer that pictures of him in court should not be allowed. John Arlia said that he was involved with the NYPD intelligence division which deals with 'infiltrating various organizations' and 'to disclose his identity would jeopardize his life, his families'. For that reason MailOnline has obscured his identity. Scroll down for videos . Occupy jail: Wojciech Braszczok, 32, was held in custody for his alleged role in the biker gang beating. He has served with NYPD for ten years and was allegedly undercover with Occupy Wall St for five of those . Biker punk: Braszczok created a very alternative online persona and he cut his hair in a mohawk to look just like those he was mixing with . Hiding: Braszczok leaves court in New York today with his face hidden after a short hearing into his role in the biker gang assault . Accused: While photographs were not permitted this court sketch was released of Braszczok at the hearing . Braszczok is charged with gang assault in the first degree, assault in the first degree and criminal mischief in the third degree. Wearing beige army combat short and a black hoodie, he did not speak during the five minute hearing at Manhattan's Criminal Court today. He was released after his legal team said they could post a $100,000 cash bail bond. The court was told that he took part in a 'brutal and brazen' attack and that while other members of the bike gang hauled Lien out of his car and set upon him, Braszczok continued to 'terrorize' his family. The criminal complaint states that he punched the rear window of the Range Rover, causing it to break. He then allegedly kicked the passenger side whilst Lien's wife was sitting in the front passenger seat and his two-year-old daughter was in the back. The criminal complaint also alleges that at the time of the assault he was wearing a black vest with the words 'Front Line Soldiers' and 'New Rochelle, NY' on it. His name, 'WOJTEK' was on the front too. Terror: The criminal complaint states that he punched the rear window of the Range Rover, causing it to break. He then allegedly kicked the passenger side whilst Lien's wife was sitting in the front passenger seat and his two-year-old daughter was in the back . Shocking: Braszczok is charged with gang assault in the first degree, assault in the first degree and criminal mischief in the third degree . Mr Arlia also denied that Braszczok, who was riding a bright red Yamaha bike, went within 12ft of the car and that the video of the incident will exonerate his client who he said was being targeted because he was a detective. He will next appear before the court on Friday . The revelation that Braszczok, 32, of Queens, New York, was embedded with Occupy will likely spark a new row with the movement which has taken the NYPD to court repeatedly over what it claims is abusive treatment. It also raises questions over whether or not Braszczok got so into his alternative lifestyle that he 'went rogue'. Rabble rousing: Braszczok tweeted Occupy events including this 'spring training' event in April, 2012 . Rogue? It is unclear how much of Braszczok's online personalities were part of his cover or his genuine lifestyle . Full throttle: Braszczok showed off his bright red Yamaha on his social media accounts - the complaint against him says he was riding one at the time of the incident . NBC New York was the first to report Braszczok's work with Occupy and said that he has spent 10 years within the force, the last five of which were undercover. MailOnline has conducted an extensive trawl of his presence on the web which supports the claim. His Twitter account makes him seem every inch the committed activist though it only has 74 tweets dating from April 2010 to May this year. Braszczok posted tweets in which he boasted of attending Occupy and Anonymous events including one dubbed ‘Spring Training’. On April 9 this year he Tweeted: ‘Noise demo 500 pearl st, ny ny, we need more ppl. So come by’. The event was at the Metropolitan Correction Center in downtown Manhattan to show support for Jeremy Hammond’s who was arrested for the Anonymous hack that released private security firm Stratfor’s documents to WikiLeaks. Hurt: Alexian Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York as he tried to protect his wife and child. It has now emerged that an undercover cop was part of the group that attacked . Before and after: Edwin Mieses Jr suffered a broken spine, fractured ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve and now may never walk again . Some 20 members of Occupy attended and, according to Occupy activist Clark Stoeckley, Braszczok may have been acting as a 'provocateur' to turn it into something more. On November 30 last year Braszczok Tweeted: ‘Hey is the *SANDY SPECIAL PART 3* REBUILDING OCCUPY TO CONNECT, MOBILIZE AND CO-CREATE WITH, assembly Happening at 60 wall today’ And on April 6 last year he also Tweeted: ‘Come join us in spring training by occupying the stock exchange today at 2:30pm. Hope to see you there’. More... 'He died like a dog': Friend's tears as autopsy reveals white soldier 'killed by black comrade' was stabbed through the heart .

The event was documented on YouTube and shows a number of protestors standing with placards under the watch of a few dozen NYPD cops. On April 1, Braszczok, whose family are Polish, uploaded the picture of the NYPD helicopter as it apparently monitored them. Braszczok's online personal life could also well be part of his cover. But on other sites he writes of his love for fast bikes, fast women and fast cars. On a Photobucket page that corresponds to his email address is a picture of a woman wearing red lingerie. He also says he is 'attractive', athletic and 6’1”. He also tweeted under a handle name that references his love of fast cars. Braszczok is also an avid gamer and has scores listed on a World of Warcraft website and one for Dragonblight. Both are hugely popular role-playing games. Elsewhere he has posted a photo of a cigar that he likes to enjoy and bragged about still being out with friends past 4am to see DJs like Carl Cox at swanky Manhattan club Cielo. On a dating website he describes himself as single and says he has two children - there are pictures of two on his mother’s Facebook page. On his MySpace page profile picture he is showing off his torso but he has no time for unattractive women and once tweeted: ‘Why these obese girl think they could wear all this sexy costumes made for skinny bitches...’ Braszczok also set up a Ustream website called ‘Pornshare’ but does not appear to have done anything with it. Hunt: The NYPD are looking for four bikers involved in the vicious assault on a family driving through Manhattan on September 29 . Several members of the motorcycle gang are being sought out for questioning by the NYPD . MailOnline has reached out to the NYPD for comment. If it is offically confirmed that Braszczok had infiltrated Occupy for the NYPD, it could spark another lawsuit against the force. New York City agreed to pay $232,000 to cover the cost of the library it destroyed when police raided Zuccotti Park to bring an end to Occupy Wall St last year. Protesters have also sued after they were sprayed with mace and for the mass arrest on Brooklyn Bridge which took place during the occupation of the park. In addition to Braszczok, Craig Wright, 29, is accused of beating Lien and Allen Edwards, 43, is said to have punched one of his car windows. Clint Caldwell, 32, has been charged with gang assault and criminal mischief. Christoper Cruz, 28, who allegedly started the altercation when he slowed down and forced Lien to bump him has denied he was to blame. Police are searching for at least two more suspects.

"By . Rachel Quigley . UPDATED: . 22:48 EST, 9 November 2011 . Looking at the shocking pictures, it is little wonder doctors described her recovery as remarkable and miraculous. With deep stitches zigzagging across her head where parts of her skull were removed and dents and bruises around her face, Gabrielle Giffords is a very lucky woman. Shot in the head on January 8 by a crazed gunman in Tucson, Arizona, it was thought that she may be in a coma for months and was very lucky she did not die. Miracle: The first look at Gabrielle Giffords in hospital after she was shot in the head, showing her scars and bruises . Smiling: Looking at the pictures of Gabby in hospital and how she looks now, it is little wonder the doctors said she has made a remarkable recovery . In a book written by her astronaut husband Mark Kelly, he recalls his wife's journey to recovery and revealed there is still hope for them to have a child. Recalling the moment he first saw Gabby in hospital after the shooting, which killed six and injured 19, Mark said: 'Nothing fully prepares you for seeing someone you love in such a critical state. 'I took it all in and then told her how much I loved her. I knew she couldn't hear me but I had to say it.' In extracts from the book published in People magazine he wrote that he promised her she would get through it and took her hand, noticing that there was caked blood under each of her fingernails. 'I tried not to cry,' he said. 'As I stood there at her bedside , a slight bloody tear fell from her left eye. I reached over and, very tenderly, wiped it away.' Shock: Mark Kelly said the first time he saw his wife he was devastated: 'Nothing fully prepares you for seeing someone you love in such a critical state' The former astronaut, who was shot into space for the fourth and final time this year, also revealed that he and Gabrielle had been planning on having a child before she was shot, though they have not ruled out the possibility. With two frozen embryos still in storage at the Walter Reed Naval Medical Centre, he said: 'It was still possible for us to have a child together, though . given Gabby's injuries, we'd probably need to go through a surrogate.' When asked about her bucket list recently by a nurse, Gabby could have said a baby or to return to Congress. But, knowing she had to put such dreams aside, she simply answered: 'Get better.' Recalling the lowest moment of her recovery, Mark writes that it was in February, when she was sitting in her wheelchair hyperventilating and panicking. He said: 'She motioned with her left hand, waving it by her mouth. It didn't take me long to figure out what was wrong. 'She had tried to speak but she couldn't and just figured out she was trapped. Trapped inside of herself. Her eyes were as wide open as I'd ever seen them and the look on her face was of absolute fear.' Proud: Captain Mark Kelly hugs his wife Representative Gabrielle Giffords after receiving the Legion of Merit from U.S. Vice President Joe Biden . An interview with the couple with Diane Sawyer will be aired on ABC on November 14. Speaking about spending time with Gabrielle and Mark to People magazine, she said: 'She is remarkable. With every move she make, she reminds all of us that the time to give up is never. She is looking at a lot of therapy but she's very disciplined about it. 'And she really has her husband by her side. He told me, ""She likes goals, so I'm setting some goals for her"". He's the captain of her team. 'Of all the people I've interviewed, she's right there at the top.' Though the book is written by Mark Kelly, Gabrielle delivers the last chapter – a single page of short sentences and phrases entitled 'Gabby's Voice' in which she says her goal is to get back to Congress. 'I will get stronger. I will return,' she vows. The 40-year-old stunned colleagues by appearing on the U.S. House floor in Washington on August 1 to vote for the debt ceiling deal, but she has focused most of her time on her recovery at TIRR Memorial Hermann, a rehabilitation center in Houston. First time: Diane Sawyer's interview with Gabby and her husband Mark will be broadcast on ABC on November 14 . In the book, her husband recalls trying to tell his wife several times what had happened that January 8 morning. But she didn't fully understand until March 12. Mark asked his wife if she remembered being shot, and she replied that she did. When he asked what she remembered about it, she said three words: 'Shot. Shocked. Scary.' Later that same day, he was reading to her from a New York Times article about her recovery and skipped over a paragraph that said six others were killed. Following along, Gabrielle knew he left something out and pushed him to tell her what it was. When she learned of the deaths, Mark writes that she was overcome with emotion and had trouble getting through therapy. As she progressed, Mark said his wife learned to talk again, reciting the U.S. Constitution and Martin Luther King Jr.'s 'I Have a Dream' speech. The book reveals that because of her injuries, Gabrielle has lost 50 per cent of her vision in both eyes.

"By . Caroline Graham . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 29 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:39 EST, 30 June 2013 . Captive: Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has been held by the Taliban since 2009 . America’s only prisoner-of-war may finally be coming home. Four years after Private Bowe Bergdahl was seized from a dusty no-man’s-land in Afghanistan, his parents are this weekend negotiating directly with the Taliban for his release. But for Bob and Jani Bergdahl, whose exhausting campaign for their son’s return is reflected in the now tattered yellow ribbons that are tied around their ranch in Hailey, Idaho, the most difficult battle may still be ahead. Because Bowe, 27, who was captured after he disappeared in remote Patika province, now stands accused of being a deserter who has been ‘turned’ by the Taliban. He has been likened to the fictional Sergeant Nicholas Brody in the television series Homeland, who converted to Islam and joined Al Qaeda while in captivity. Rumours that he has gone rogue were prompted by Bowe’s criticism of the Army’s actions in Afghanistan. In one email to his parents, Bowe spoke of being ‘ashamed’ of being American and criticised the Army’s ‘arrogance’ in Afghanistan. The rumours have been a bitter blow to the Bergdahls who maintain their son is no traitor. ‘I’ll defend his character until the day I die,’ insists his father. On the streets of his home town, Bob cuts a striking and forlorn figure. He stopped shaving to show solidarity with his son, whose four-year ‘anniversary’ is this weekend. The long red beard is his way of supporting his ‘forgotten’ boy. He has even changed the clocks in his house to Afghan time and learned Pashto in his desperation to understand what Bowe is enduring. He says: ‘I do not live here, I live in Afghanistan. I might be standing here but I am living vicariously through my son. A father does not leave his son alone. I will not leave Bowe on the battlefield. He is not forgotten.’ The extraordinary story of America’s sole prisoner-of-war is one of the least-known of the 12-year Afghan war. But it has been catapulted into the limelight after the Taliban opened its first ‘embassy’ in Doha, the capital of Qatar, and announced they were ready to exchange Bowe for five senior Al Qaeda leaders currently held at Guantanamo Bay. Much mystery, however, surrounds Bowe’s disappearance. In the weeks before his capture, he was becoming increasingly disillusioned with Army life and with the Allied ‘hearts and minds’ campaign being waged in Afghanistan. Turned? Bowe Berghdal, pictured in a video released by the Taliban in December 2010, has been accused of deserting the US Army and allying himself with the enemy . In letters and emails, he expressed doubts to his parents, saying in one email: ‘I feel ashamed to even be American. The horror of the self-righteous arrogance that they thrive in. It is all revolting.’ Bowe also wrote of his ‘disgust’ at seeing an Afghan child run over by a military vehicle: ‘We don’t even care when we hear each other talk about running their children down in the dirt streets with our armoured trucks.’ The suggestion that he may have ‘switched sides’ was further mooted in an article in Rolling Stone magazine, written with the cooperation of Bowe’s family, which revealed he ‘slipped off’ from his outpost carrying water, a knife, a digital camera and his diary. In a final email to his parents, Bowe wrote a line that has since been interpreted by many as a ‘farewell note’. It said: ‘I am sorry for everything. The horror that is America is disgusting. The US Army is the biggest joke the world has to laugh at. It is an army of liars, backstabbers, fools and bullies.’ The article also quoted other soldiers saying Bowe had talked about walking to Pakistan if his deployment proved ‘lame’ and had asked a superior officer if he would get into trouble if he took his weapon if he left base. And two years ago, Taliban commander Haji Nadeem claimed Bowe was providing training to the insurgents on bomb-making techniques and teaching them how to lay ambushes. But Nadeem said the Taliban later felt ‘tricked’ when Bowe escaped – only to be recaptured. Though Bowe was clearly an idealistic young man who, before he joined the Army, thought nothing of travelling the world at a moment’s notice, the allegations have been stoutly denied by the US Department of Defence and President Obama has said his release is of ‘the highest priority’. Support: Jani and Bob Bergdahl refuse to believe that their son is a deserter and hope he will soon be released from captivity . Certainly few in his home town of Hailey believe them. A picturesque community of just 7,000 people nestled in the stunning Sawtooth Mountains, its inhabitants are delighted Bowe may be coming home and that the Bergdahls’ ‘four years of agony’ will end. Bowe was a private when he was captured in South Eastern Afghanistan on June 30, 2009, but has been promoted twice in his absence by the US Army and now holds the rank of sergeant. He is being held by the Haqqani network, a Taliban-affiliated terrorist group, in Pakistan’s NorthWest Frontier tribal area. Five videos have been released of him over the past four years. Just ten days ago, his family received a letter from him via the Red Cross. At Zaney’s Cafe, where Bowe worked as a barista before he enlisted with the 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, owner Sue Martin has posted pictures of him on the cafe wall. ' Jani wouldn’t tell me too much about the contents of the letter,’ she said. ‘The family has to be very careful what they say as negotiations are at a critical point. We are waiting every day for the news that Bowe is on his way home. Similar story: Pvt Berghdal has been compared to Homeland's Nicholas Brody, played by Damian Lewis, who converted to Islam in captivity . ‘But she did say that some of the . letter was clearly scripted by the Taliban, though other parts were . ‘‘pure Bowe’’ and it gave her real hope that he is doing well both . mentally and physically. 'He is the forgotten victim of this war. 'Here in . Hailey, we’ve never forgotten him but, at times, it has felt like he’s . been forgotten by the rest of the world. 'Most people I speak to have no . idea there is still a lone American prisoner- of-war. It’s shameful this . story is not known around the globe.’ Leanne . Ferris, who lives next door to the Bergdahls’ 40-acre ranch and has . known the soldier all his life, said: ‘Bowe would never have deserted. He was always an idealistic and naive young man. 'I believe he was . befriended by an Afghan soldier and then lured away from his troop and . that’s when the Taliban grabbed him. 'Apparently they jumped on him while . he was going to the toilet. ‘I think his main crime is being an . idealist. He tried to join the French Foreign Legion before he joined . the US Army. He gave up on that when he learned he’d have to give up his . US passport. He was always a dreamer, someone who thought he could make . a difference. He’s many things but he’s not a traitor. ‘I . think he joined the army because he believed he could make a difference . to the lives of people over there. And then he got there and saw what . war was really like. He’s a small-town kid who was in the wrong place at . the wrong time.’ Meanwhile, . Mr Bergdahl has told friends he is ‘staying up around the clock’ to . email with men he believes are legitimate Taliban negotiators. Friends . say the strain he is under is evident. ‘Bob has gone native,’ one says. ‘He’s grown that ridiculous beard, speaks Pashto, stays up all night on . Afghan time. Sometimes I worry he’s lost his mind. But he’s a dad who . wants his kid back and who wouldn’t do the same? ‘My main worry is what happens when Bowe comes home? Bob’s whole life for four years has been this campaign. I worry that the Bowe who comes home to Hailey won’t be the same Bowe who left here and then the family will be torn apart.’ For now, Hailey continues to anxiously await the return of its missing son. Banners of support hang in store windows alongside the stars and stripes. Yellow ribbons are tied to every tree along Main Street and locals wear yellow rubber wristbands with Bowe’s name on them. As Jani Bergdahl’s friend Sue Martin says: ‘We are hopeful we’re in the home straight. After so many years, we just want Bowe home. Then there will be a homecoming party to end all parties.’ At the family’s modest ranch home, his mother Jani, 53, said: ‘I have new optimism and real hope for the first time in a long time. ‘My husband will go to Doha, he will sit down and talk with the Taliban. We’ll do whatever it takes. We have gone through years of agony. Now, finally, we are very optimistic that he’ll be home soon.’","Pvt Bowe Berghdal, 27, has been held in Afghanistan since 2009 .

Given her mother’s willingness to take on the law for a worthy cause, it’s little surprise Chrissie Hynde’s daughter has inherited something of a fighting spirit. But it seems even fearless rock stars get a little anxious when their offspring are the ones doing the protesting. Pretenders singer Chrissie, who was once arrested over her animal rights campaigning, has been fretting about whether daughter Natalie is ‘warm enough’ since she joined a group protesting against a new road. The 28-year-old has swapped her comfortable flat for a snow-covered treehouse 15ft off the ground to try to prevent the development tearing through a beauty spot. Activist Nathalie Hynde, daughter of singer Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders, and Ray Davies of The Kinks, sits in a tree house during a protest . Natalie is opposed to the construction of the £94million road. (Right picture) Natalie (left) and mother Chrissie Hynde at the UK premiere of Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten . Miss Hynde, whose father is Ray Davies of The Kinks, said her 61-year-old mother was ‘delighted’ to see her taking a stand, but added: ‘She’s my mother so of course she’s anxious about my health and worried that I’m keeping warm enough. ‘She’s concerned about things like pneumonia, because it is bitterly cold. But she’s confident that I know what I’m doing and sensible. She knows that we all take very good precautions to make sure we stay healthy.’ Miss Hynde said her decision to join the protest group was in part because of the ‘inspiration’ of her mother, who was arrested in 2000 for protesting about animal rights outside a New York branch of the Gap clothing chain. Miss Hynde said: ‘She’s been a great influence on me, and one of the reasons we are so opposed to this road is because of the impact it will have on animals in the area. ‘This is a wildlife haven and the road will destroy much of that. Miss Hynde has joined protestors who say the construction of the road will destroy the unspoilt Combe Haven Valley . No-frills: Natalie Hynde faces a spartan existence at the makeshift camp, which stands in the path of the proposed road . Plan: The proposed route of the new road between Bexhill and Hastings . ‘But I have also found my own way. My main concern is climate change and the increased damage this will do to the planet by increasing emissions. ‘We should be encouraging people to drive less, not more.’ Miss Hynde moved to St Leonards-On-Sea in East Sussex last year, and joined protesters trying to protect the nearby Combe Haven Valley beauty spot just after Christmas. Developers plan to build a link road that will connect Bexhill with Hastings, concreting over a swathe of ancient forest and rolling farmland in the process. Medhurst said: 'I try to dig an oval-shaped hole which will hopefully support itself, it was perfected by the Vietnamese in the Vietnam War, and I'm willing to risk my life' The Mail reported last week how many of those taking part in the protest are in their 50s and 60s and choosing to take up activism rather than wind down to retirement. Miss Hynde’s fellow protesters include 58-year-old grandmother Hilda Stewart and Simon ‘Sitting Bull’ Medhurst, who dug a tunnel underneath the road building site in a bid to stop the development. The group sleep in treehouses made from tarpaulin and cargo netting, huddling under muddy sleeping bags at night. Miss Hynde said: ‘We all work together and have had great support from locals who have brought us wonderful vegan meals that we heat up over a fire in the evening. Of course, I have to be realistic and say that ultimately we are unlikely to win this battle against the road. ‘The main thing is to make a stand and make it as hard as we possibly can for those building it.’ Many observers say the Combe Haven Valley fight has rekindled memories of the ‘tree people’ of  the 1990s, when dreadlocked protester Daniel Hooper – known as ‘Swampy’ – briefly became a minor national celebrity.

First responders who arrived at massive airport fire in Kenya looted electronics, a bank and an ATM, it has been claimed. Officials investigating the fire at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport told the Associated Press valuables were stolen by emergency services including police, firefighters and the army. The fire broke out on the 15th . anniversary of U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed . 224 people in total, mostly Kenyans, but also a dozen Americans. Scroll down for video . Damage: The blackened arrivals hall of Nairobi airport a day after a huge blaze engulfed the terminal . Devastating: A firefighter looks on at the remains of the airport terminal in Kenya . Stranded: Passengers who have been stuck at Nairobi since the blaze broke out may now be able to catch their flights . Today, international flights resumed landing . and taking off from the fire-damaged airport and . officials said they expected to return to full operations by the day's end. Kenyan officials, assisted by members of the FBI, are investigating the cause of the fire. Anonymous sources have alleged that first responders . stole electronics and money from an ATM. It is also believed that . police guarding the site overnight attempted to a take a safe from a . bank in the burned-out arrivals hall, which also houses several foreign . currency exchange shops. All public servants in Kenya, including . police, firefighters and soldiers, are poorly paid and frequently . accused of corruption. Police officers who guard the entrance to Jomo . Kenyatta International Airport are well known in Nairobi for demanding . bribes from taxi drivers and other vehicles with Kenyan drivers. The fire-fighting response to Wednesday's inferno was criticized as slow and inadequate, but the officials could not definitely say the looting was carried out by firefighters. Destroyed: The remains of the baggage claim area which has been gutted by the blaze . Dispute: Officials investigating the blaze say emergency services looted the airport during the fire . Chaos: The slow response of the emergency services to the Nairobi airport fire has sparked angry debate . One official said there was now behind-the-scenes finger pointing taking place between the police, fire department and army. Another official said specialized police units had attempted to steal the safe overnight. The criminal investigations policeman for the airport, Joseph Ngisa, said he hasn't received formal complaints of theft and that police are waiting for affected institutions to report what they lost in the fire. A security official said the investigation had ruled out terrorism and was now trying to determine if the fire was intentional or accidental. Michael Kamau, the cabinet secretary for transport and infrastructure, said the design of the airport - constructed in the mid-1970s - made it challenging for firefighters to access certain areas with water hoses. Fighting: Sources say police, fire and army officials are blaming each other for the looting . Investigation: Security officials say terrorism has been ruled out as a cause of the fire . Destruction: The airport terminal has been virtually burned to the ground by the ferocious blaze . But Kamau insisted he was 'satisfied' by the response of firefighters from private companies but did not mention the airport firefighters, who responded slowly and whose equipment wasn't fully functioning. Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is East Africa's largest aviation hub, and the fire disrupted air travel across the continent as the airport canceled all international flights. Many inbound flights were diverted to Tanzania and the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa. Domestic flights were being operated from the airport's cargo terminal. Firefighters were desperately short of equipment. The airport has fire trucks but some were not filled with water and personnel couldn't be found to drive others. At one point while battling the blaze men in government uniforms lined up to pass buckets of water to fight the fire. Inferno: Black smoke billows from the international arrival unit of Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport . Blaze: The massive fire closed East Africa's largest airport and caused flights to be diverted . Closed: Dark black smoke was visible across much of Nairobi as it billowed from the airport . No serious injuries were reported. President Barack Obama called Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta to offer U.S. support. Nairobi is the capital of East Africa's largest economy, but public-sector services such as police and fire departments are hobbled by small budgets, corrupt money managers and outdated equipment or an absence of equipment. 'From what you can see the damage is pretty extensive. It has extended until the immigration area. The electrical system is all down. Mechanical systems are all down. You can see the displays are all down, so it's huge,' said Ali Ayoob, an airport engineer. Flames: Passengers said they heard as explosions believed to be gas canisters on fire at the airport .

Halliburton Co has agreed to plead guilty to destroying computer test results related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday. The government said Halliburton's guilty plea is the third by a company over the spill and requires the world's second-largest oilfield services company to pay a maximum $200,000 statutory fine. Halliburton also agreed to three years of probation and to continue cooperating with the criminal probe into the April 20, 2010, explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. Disaster: The fire aboard the mobile offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, USA. The explosion happened on 20 April 2010 triggering the worst oil spill in US history . The company said in a statement Thursday night that it had agreed to . plead guilty 'to one misdemeanor violation associated with the deletion . of records created after the Macondo well incident, to pay the statutory . maximum fine of $200,000 and to accept a term of three years . probation.' The Justice Department has agreed it will not pursue further criminal . prosecution of the company or its subsidiaries for any conduct arising . from the 2010 spill, Halliburton's statement said, adding that federal . officials have also 'acknowledged the company's significant and valuable . cooperation during the course of its investigation.' The plea agreement is subject to court approval, the company said. Court approval is required. Houston-based Halliburton also made a separate, voluntary $55 million payment to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the Justice Department said. Edward Sherman, a Tulane University law professor, said the plea could suggest weakness in Halliburton's position in negotiating a settlement over spill-related liabilities. 'Their willingness to plead to this may also indicate that they'd like to settle up with the federal government on the civil penalties,' he said. 'It may indicate a softening of their position.' Rescue: Support ships are seen near where efforts continue to recover oil and cap the Deepwater Horizon spill site on July 3, 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana . Halliburton confirmed in a statement that it pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge and confirmed the plea agreement's terms. The disaster caused 11 deaths and triggered the largest U.S. offshore oil spill following the rupture of the Macondo oil well, which was 65 percent owned by BP Plc. Halliburton had earlier provided cementing services to help seal the well. Halliburton was BP's cement contractor on the drilling rig that . exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. According to the news release, Halliburton conducted its own review . of the well's design and construction after the blowout, and established . a working group to review ""whether the number of centralizers used on . the final production casing could have contributed to the blowout."" The casing is a steel pipe placed in a well to maintain its integrity. Halliburton Energy Services has agreed to plead guilty to destroying evidence in connection with the 2010 Gulf oil spill, the Department of Justice said Thursday . Halliburton was BP's cement contractor on the drilling rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The disaster triggered an explosion that killed 11 and spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf . Centralizers are metal collars attached on the outside of the casing. Centralizers can help keep the casing centered in the wellbore. 'Centralization can be significant to the quality of subsequent . cementing around the bottom of the casing,' the news release said . According to the government, Halliburton recommended to BP that the Macondo well contain 21 centralizers, metal collars that can improve cementing, but BP chose to use six. The government said that, during an internal probe into the cementing after the blowout, Halliburton ordered workers to destroy computer simulations that showed little difference between using six and 21 centralizers. Efforts to locate the simulations forensically were unsuccessful, the government said. A document detailing the allegations was filed with the U.S. District Court in New Orleans. Around May 2010, the news release says, the company directed a . program manager to conduct two computer simulations of the Macondo well . final cementing job 'to compare the impact of using six versus 21 . centralizers.' BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg (R), flanked by outgoing Chief Executive Tony Hayward (L) address the media outside the company's head office in central London, on July 27, 2010 after Hayward stepped down following the Deepwater disaster . The simulations indicated there was little difference between using . six and 21 centralizers, but the program manager ""was directed to, and . did, destroy these results,"" federal officials say. Similar evidence was destroyed in a subsequent incident, in June 2010, the Justice Department said. 'Efforts to forensically recover the original destroyed Displace 3D . computer simulations during ensuing civil litigation and federal . criminal investigation by the Deepwater Horizon Task Force were . unsuccessful,' the news release said. 'In agreeing to plead guilty, . Halliburton has accepted criminal responsibility for destroying the . aforementioned evidence.' The plea agreement and criminal charge both arise from a criminal . investigation by the Deepwater Horizon Task Force into the spill. Pelicans rest on an oil retention boom on July 25, 2010 near Grand Isle, Louisiana in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster that killed 11 and decimated local eco-systems . U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans recently presided . over a trial in the matter and could decide how much more money BP, . Halliburton and rig owner Transocean Ltd. owe for their roles in the . catastrophe. Halliburton and BP have blamed each other for the failure of the cement job to seal the Macondo well. During the spring trial, BP asked a federal judge to sanction . Halliburton for allegedly destroying evidence about the role that its . cement slurry design could have played in the blowout. After the trial started on Feb. 25, Halliburton discovered cement . samples at a Lafayette laboratory that weren't turned over to the . Justice Department for testing after the spill. Halliburton lawyers . called it a 'simple misunderstanding"" and accused BP of trying to create . a 'sideshow.' Halliburton announced in April that it was trying to negotiate a . settlement to resolve a substantial portion of private claims it has . faced since the Deepwater Horizon rig blast spawned America's worst . offshore oil spill. Fire boat response crews battle the blazing remnants of the offshore oil rig Deepwater Horizon, off Louisiana, in this April 21, 2010 file handout image . BP and Transocean Ltd, which owned the drilling rig, previously entered guilty pleas over other aspects of the Gulf oil spill, and agreed to pay respective criminal fines of $1.26 billion and $400 million. Both declined to comment on the Halliburton plea. Halliburton, BP and Transocean are also defendants in a federal civil trial that began in February to apportion blame and set damages for the oil spill. The first witness for Halliburton, cementing service coordinator Nathaniel Chaisson, had testified that he was concerned about BP's use of just six centralizers. The trial is scheduled to resume in September.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:08 EST, 27 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:10 EST, 27 August 2013 . A mother-of-four is serving a lengthy prison sentence after tricking her family and friends into believing she was pregnant with twins - before falsely claiming they had died in childbirth. Leslie Wilfred, 37, also convinced doctors and friends in Thomasville, Georgia that her four other young children suffered from serious illnesses, leading one to undergo invasive surgeries. She was eventually diagnosed with Munchausen syndrome and Munchausen-by-proxy, in which sufferers make up illnesses for themselves and their children and often induce the symptoms. Two years after she was sentenced to eight years in prison, the lead investigator in the case has spoken to FoxNews.com about her string of lies and how they were discovered. Plot: Mother-of-four Leslie Wilfred, pictured with her husband Chris, pretended her children were ill and that she had given birth to stillborn babies - when she had never even been pregnant . 'I've been in law enforcement for 30 . years and have been an investigator for 25 of those years. I've . investigated everything from homicides to armed thefts,' Officer Bob . Brettel said. 'I had never encountered anything like this before.' He revealed how police learned of the scheme when Child Protective Services were interviewing her about her unruly stepson, and noticed she was talking about his attitude harming the unborn babies. After claiming the babies had indeed died, CPS decided to investigate further and discovered the litany of lies, extending to all of her children. Wilfred had four children when she married Chris - who also had a son of his own from a previous relationship - on June 23, 2007. Wilfred claimed her then 13-year-old son had needed his gallbladder removed as a child after she took him to the doctor with frequent vomiting. She also claimed he needed a liver transplant. She also had a daughter, 9, who suffered from leukemia, she said. The girl supposedly underwent chemotherapy and collection pots were placed around . town to raise money for her medical bills. Guilty: Leslie Wilfred, left, was convicted of several counts of cruelty to children after pretending her kids were ill when they were not. Her husband, right, was convicted on one count for locking up his son . Doctors found that Leslie Wilfred had Munchausen and Munchausen by proxy. In both conditions, the person . purposefully fabricates medical conditions so that they can get attention or sympathy. Munchausen syndrome patients . tell falsehoods about themselves, while in Munchausen by . proxy, an adult will invent medical conditions for his or her child. A dangerous facet of this is how they will often induce symptoms in the child to better illustrate the lie. Munchausen by proxy is . typically considered a severe form of child abuse. They belong to a group of conditions called factitious disorders, which are either made up or self-inflicted. If it is not discovered, it can lead to death from self-inflicting the harm or because of harming the child. Dr. Marc Feldman, an international expert in the disorder, told Fox: 'It . is a diagnosis of people who evolve lifestyles in which they travel . from hospital to hospital, getting themselves admitted and subjecting . themselves to surgery they don't need. 'What they have . in common is this quest for sympathy – a desperate search and yearning . for some kind of identity as a patient or the vicarious identity of a . patient.' Due to the dishonest nature of the condition, it is hard to say how many people in the U.S. suffer from Munchausen syndrome, but it is considered to be rare. It generally more typically occurs in men than in woman and most often affects young adults. Wilfred claimed that her other children also suffered from medical conditions and that one child, who was then 11, was the result of her being raped by her co-worker. This was never reported to police. Around this time, Wilfred also claimed she had fallen pregnant with the couple's twins. She took pictures of her rounded belly - but did not reveal to friends or family that she had actually had her tubes tied ahead of the marriage, making a pregnancy impossible. In 2008, the couple called the police about Chris' son, claiming he had threatened the family with a knife. They complained he was unruly and neighbors rarely saw him leave the home. After the knife incident, Child Protective Services launched an investigation and Wilfred regularly met with a caseworker - who noticed some bizarre behavior. 'During this whole period of time when . the mother would be talking to his attorney, she made several references . about his behavior being responsible for the safety and wellbeing of . her unborn twins,' Brettel told Fox. It was almost as if she was predicting the future. On November 10, 2008, Wilfred called her husband and family from hospital to say the twins, who she had been carrying for five months, were stillborn and had been cremated. Three days later, the family gathered to mourn the babies at the family's local church, where their ashes were placed in teddy-bear shaped urns and ultrasounds were put on display. Little did the family know that the urns had been ordered five days ahead of the 'birth' and that the ultrasounds belonged to a stranger - and had been downloaded from the internet. When CPS learned about the . stillbirths, they contacted Brettel, who in turn contacted the hospital - . and found they did not have records of her check ups or birth. As . the investigation continued, officers learned that the eldest son did . not need a liver transplant and they questioned whether his gallbladder . had been removed unnecessarily. Mistreatment: She claimed one of her daughters, pictured, had leukemia and one of her sons needed a liver transplant. Investigators said they are glad they learned of the case before they were seriously hurt . They also learned that the daughter had not suffered from leukemia and Wilfred had instead lied about going for chemotherapy treatments. In yet another startling twist, officers then searched the couple's home and found that Chris' son had been tied in a small wooden box inside a linen closet every night as the family slept. The couple said that the boy was violent and needed to be constrained - but analysis of him showed he only suffered from PTSD as a result of being locked in the box. Wilfred herself underwent evaluations and found that she had Munchausen syndrome - but no other major mental health issues. 'She is not psychiatrically ill in the . sense of a major diagnosis like schizophrenia,' Dr Marc Feldman said. 'There are no psychiatric excuses for what she did.  She has a . personality disorder which means she has long-term, self-defeating ways . to deal with stress.' Cruelty: After authorities learned of her lies, they searched the home and found Wilfred's stepson was locked in a box in the closet each night in their home, pictured. The couple claimed the boy was unruly . Feldman, an expert in Munchausen, added that people with the condition often have passive partners; Chris claimed he had no idea that his wife had been lying. Wilfred eventually pleaded guilty to several counts of . cruelty to children and theft by deception for the donation buckets, and she is currently serving an . eight-year sentence. Chris was convicted of one count of cruelty to children, and both . parents have been ordered not to contact their children without permission from the court. The children have not suffered any permanent physical damage and are living in foster care. But Brettel said he believes the children could have suffered much worse harm - or death - if the case had not been discovered. 'She was pretty much in denial about . doing anything significantly wrong,' Brettel said of Wilfred.  'She didn't think . she had done anything to harm her children.'","Leslie Wilfred, 37, pretended she had given birth to the twins at five months and a memorial service was held for their 'ashes'

Research suggests the galaxy is teeming with life – and the nearest habitable world is near enough to see with the naked eye. This other world is just one of around 40 billion ‘Earths’ in the Milky Way. Researcher Andrew Howard said: ‘Potential sites for life to get started are abundant in the galaxy. Scroll down for videos... One in five stars similar to the sun is circled by an Earth-like planet that might be habitable, scientists believe. This graphic shows something scientists call the 'habitable zone' where the planet's orbit is not too far from the star such that water freezes, and not too close such that water vapourises . ‘We still don’t know how easily life can spring forth on a potentially habitable planet but with 40 billion chances, I’m optimistic that we’re not alone.’ The US team used data collected by Nasa’s Kepler telescope, which took photographs of 150,000 stars every 30 minutes for four years. These images were then analysed for small but regular dips in the star’s light – a telltale sign that a planet is passing in front of it. Some 42,000 of the stars monitored were like the sun or slightly cooler and these had 603 planets orbiting them. The data was collected from Kepler which conducted a massive search for planets beyond our solar system. It detected the tiny dip in brightness that occurs when an orbiting object crosses, or 'transits', in front of a star . The Kepler spacecraft observed 150,000 stars within a field in the constellation Cygnus. Kepler, now crippled and its four-year mission at an end, was able to provide enough data to complete its mission objective: to determine how many of the 100 billion stars in our galaxy have potentially habitable planets . The hunt is on for planets about the size of Earth that orbit at just the right distance from their star - in a region termed the habitable zone. The habitable zone is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water -- an essential ingredient for life as we know it -- to pool on a planet's surface. To determine the location of a star's habitable zone, scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits. Knowing precisely how far away a habitable zone needs to be from a star also depends on chemistry. For example, molecules in a planet's atmosphere will absorb a certain amount of energy from starlight and radiate the rest back out. How much of this energy is trapped can mean the difference between a turquoise sea and erupting volcanoes. Ten . of these were Earth-like, that is, roughly the size of our planet and . just the right distance from their star for it to be neither too hot or . too cold for life to survive. After accounting for holes in the data, they estimated that 22 per cent of all sun-like stars are circled by a planet that could be suitable for life. Many are much larger than the Earth, or follow orbits so close to their parent stars that their surfaces would be roasted. But some are roughly Earth-size and lie in the 'habitable' or 'Goldilocks' zone - the orbital band close enough to a star for temperatures to be just right for life. By definition, habitable zone temperatures are mild enough to allow oceans and lakes of liquid water. In a galaxy of 200 billion stars of various types, this works out at 11 billion planets. But factor smaller, dimmer red dwarf stars, and the number of planets with mild temperatures similar to Earth  rises to 40 billion. The relative sizes of Kepler habitable zone planets discovered in April are shown (from left to right) Kepler-22b, Kepler-69c, Kepler-62e, Kepler-62f, and Earth . Kepler, which cost £395 million, was launched in March 2009 with the chief aim of searching for Earth-sized planets that might support life. Kepler used something known as the 'transit method' to detect extrasolar planets. A transit occurs when a planet crosses in front of its star as viewed by an observer. Transits by terrestrial planets produce a small change in a star's brightness lasting for one to 16 hours. Scientists believe this change must be periodic if it is caused by a planet. They . also claim that all transits produced by the same planet must be of the . same change in brightness and last the same amount of time. Once . Kepler detected a pattern such as this, scientists could calculate the . planet's orbital size from how long it took for the planet to orbit once . around the star. The size of the planet is found from how much the brightness of the star drops as well as the star's size. From the orbital size and the temperature of the star, the planet's characteristic temperature can be calculated. Knowing the temperature of a planet is key to whether or not the planet is habitable. Dr Howard, of the University of Hawaii, said: ‘Our galaxy has 40 billion chances for life to get started and evolve. ‘Today, more than ever we need to focus on searching for intelligent life.’ However, not all of the temperate planets will be able to harbour life. Researcher Geoffrey Marcy (CORR), of the University of California, Berkeley, said: ‘Some may have thick atmospheres, making it so hot at the surface that DNA-like molecules would not survive. ‘Others may have rocky surfaces that could harbour liquid water suitable for living organisms.’ He added: 'The primary goal of the Kepler mission was to answer the question, when you look up in the night sky, what fraction of the stars that you see have Earth-size planets at lukewarm temperatures so that water would not be frozen into ice or vapourised into steam, but remain a liquid, because liquid water is now understood to be the prerequisite for life. Kepler, which cost £395 million, was launched in March 2009 with the chief aim of searching for Earth-sized planets that might support life. Pictured here is a 100-square-degree patch of sky in the Milky Way galaxy taken by Kepler . This image shows the comparative life zones of stars. Stars that are smaller, cooler and lower mass than the Sun (M-dwarfs) have their habitable zone much closer to the star than the Sun . 'Until now, no one knew exactly how common potentially habitable planets were around Sun-like stars in the galaxy.' Colleague Erik (CORR) Petigura, who led the analysis, said: ‘What this means is, when you look up at the thousands of stars in the night sky, the nearest sun-like star with an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone is probably only 12 light years away and can be seen with the naked eye. ‘That is amazing.’ Dr Subhanjoy Mohanty, an Imperial College London astrophysicist, said the study ‘certainly increases the chances’ that we are not alone. He added: ‘This is an added impetus for planned future missions which will study the atmospheres of these potentially habitable planets, enabling us to investigate whether they are in fact habitable or not and also whether their atmospheres show actual biosignatures of existing life.’ Last week, scientists analysing data from the Kepler probe found that a small hot planet orbiting a star 700 light years away bears striking similarities to Earth. The planet, named Kepler 78b, is the smallest exoplanet whose mass and size are known. It is just 1.2 times bigger than Earth, 1.7 times more massive, and has an almost identical density. Scientists believe that, like the Earth, Kepler 78b mostly consists of rock and iron. There the similarities end, however. The planet hugs its parent star so closely that nothing could live on its scorching surface. Kepler 78b's year is just 8.5 hours long - the length of time it takes to complete one orbit round its star. 'It's Earth-like in the sense that it's about the same size and mass, but of course it's extremely unlike the Earth in that it's at least 2,000 degrees hotter,' said Dr Josh Winn, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US, who took part in the research published in the journal Nature. 'It's a step along the way of studying truly Earth-like planets.'","Team used data from Kepler telescope which took images of 150,000 stars .

Google has said it will manually change its search rankings to 'demote' its own Chrome web browser for two months -  after the site was caught breaking its own rules by paying bloggers to write posts promoting it. 'We've investigated and are taking manual action to demote Chrome and lower the site's PageRank for a period of at least 60 days,' a spokesman said in an email. PageRank is the key to Google's search algorithm - the lower a site's number, the lower it usually ranks in Google searches. The move is an unprecedented one for the search giant. 'We've investigated and are taking manual action to demote Chrome and lower the site's PageRank for a period of at least 60 days,' a spokesman said in an email . The search giant has taken the unprecedented step of 'demoting' its own search browser for 60 days in response to the scandal . Google has already removed most of the offending posts - which it claimed were created by a third-party advertising agency. The posts violate Google's own policies on which links and posts are counted in search results. Google traditionally frowns on any posts that are created with a view to boosting a site's PageRank by linking to it. 'Some SEOs and webmasters engage in the practice of buying and selling links that pass PageRank, disregarding the quality of the links, the sources, and the long-term impact it will have on their sites,' the site says in its policies. 'Buying or selling links that pass PageRank is in violation of Google's Webmaster Guidelines and can negatively impact a site's ranking in search results.' The posts contained very . vague praise of Chrome with little original content, and helped the . browser gain in popularity in Google's PageRank algorithm which . determines which sites come at the top of search results. The campaign was in violation of Google's own policies - and while the site says it did not authorise the campaign, it has agreed to demote Chrome in its results for 60 days . Google . said that it did not authorise the controversial marketing campaign, . and claimed that the company had 'consistently avoided paid . sponsorships'. The offending posts came in the form of blog entries talking about the benefits of Google Chrome, especially for small businesses. Many of these posts talked in a general way about the benefits of doing business online, and ended with a video from Google's latest advertising campaign. The sponsored messages all ended by saying 'This post is sponsored by Google Chrome.' They could also be identified by the phrase 'Google Chrome helped this small business in Vermont go global. What can Google Chrome do for your future?', which appears in a large number of the paid posts. Another controversial aspect of the campaign is that the blog posts link to Google Chrome's website but are not classified as 'nofollow' links, an attribute which would ensure that they are not counted in search results. The practice of marking paid-for links as 'nofollow' was originally suggested by Google itself. Google issued a statement claiming that it was not directly responsible for the sponsored posts and blaming advertising agencies it had hired for other purposes. The company said: 'Google never agreed to anything more than online ads. 'We have consistently avoided paid sponsorships, including paying bloggers to promote our products, because these kind of promotions are not transparent or in the best interests of users. 'We’re now looking at what changes we need to make to ensure that this never happens again.' One agency publicly apologised to Google for running the unauthorised and 'poor quality' campaign, but another company thought to have been responsible for some posts denied its involvement.","Google is to manually 'demote' its Chrome browser - making it appear lower in searches .

Two teenage Muslim pupils have been put into 'isolation' and banned from lessons after refusing to shave off their beards for religious reasons. Mount Carmel Roman Catholic High School, in Accrington, Lancashire, has said the two 14-year-olds are in breach of the dress code, which bans beards as well as false nails, fake tan, make-up, dyed hair and inappropriate jewellery. But the boys' families have said they are suffering discrimination because beards are a symbol of faith and their religion forbids them to shave. Two Muslim students have been banned from lessons at Mount Carmel Roman Catholic High School, in Lancashire, for breaching the dress code by refusing to shave off their beards . The school has said after conducting its own research it has concluded they are not required by the Koran to wear beards, and are making a choice to do so. The school remains adamant they will not be allowed to go back until the matter is resolved. Around a third of the 750 pupils at Mount Carmel are from ethnic minorities, mostly Pakistani, according to the 2012 Ofsted report. Xavier Bowers, head teacher at the school, said governors had decided no exceptions could be made to the uniform policy. But a relative of one of the boys said: 'Because these boys cannot shave their beards for religious reasons, they are being put in isolation for six-and-a-half hours every day. 'They are not being allowed to mix with anybody or speak to friends. It is pure discrimination. 'They chose that school because it is within their area and has good results. The school has to have an open policy and they have to take in people from all religions.' She said the youngsters were put in a room on their own and made to study without the rest of their classmates. She . also said their parents sent the school a letter of complaint . explaining they could not shave as their beards were symbols of their . faith. The school has said the pupils are breaching the dress code, which bans beards as well as false nails, fake tan, make-up, dyed hair and inappropriate jewellery (file picture) The letter has since been retracted to allow for talks between the families, teachers and the Lancashire Council of Mosques, due to take place today, the relative said. Mr Bowers said the rule had been in . place for a while, but had been strictly enforced from the beginning of . the new term, after letters explaining there would be no exceptions were . sent out. He said: 'The rule in school is that all boys have to be clean shaven. 'Having . said that, there were two Year 11 boys last year who had grown a beard . and because it was months or weeks before their GCSE exams, I spoke to . the two boys, who explained that on religious grounds, they wanted to . keep their beards. 'Because these boys cannot shave . their beards for religious reasons, they are being put in isolation for . six-and-a-half hours every day. They are not being allowed to mix with anybody or speak to friends. It is pure discrimination' - A relative of one of the boys . 'I felt it was an unfair pressure to bear on them and I agreed to an exception. 'On the back of that, I made arrangements to speak to a number of other Asian boys who were also sporting beards to make them aware there would not be any further exceptions and, when they came back after the summer, they were expected to be clean-shaven. All but two did. 'Children who turn up to school with red hair, inappropriate jewellery, false tan or make-up are isolated in a room until the matter is addressed and then they return to their normal day. 'These boys were given the option to do that and chose not to.' The issue of whether beards are compulsory for devout Muslims is open to interpretation, according to Professor Muhammad Abdel Haleem, of the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. He said the Prophet Muhammad was believed to have had a beard and that men insisting on doing the same claimed they were emulating his actions. Mr Bowers said the issue was not one of religion, but of upholding school rules. He said: 'We have not taken this decision lightly. I have spent quite a lot of time researching the issue and speaking to Muslim elders. 'There is nothing specifically written in the Koran about wearing a beard. It is a choice those boys are making. However inclusive we are, we have standards to maintain.' Chairman of governors Dennis Ford said: 'The decision to uphold the rule was made by governors and it is a rule for everybody.' Abdul Hamid Quereshi, chairman of the Lancashire Council of Mosques, said: 'The headteacher is co-operating and the school wants to learn about the issue and address them appropriately. 'Different people have different variations of understanding. 'Some are newly interacting with the Muslim community and it is our duty not to put people in awkward positions.' Last week the Prime Minister indicated he would support guidelines to judges, teachers and immigration officers telling them when Muslim women can be asked to remove their veils.","Students have been in 'isolation' at Lancashire school for almost a month .

A German woman has lived without money for 16 years following a lifetime of guilt about wealth stemming from her time as a World War Two refugee. Growing up in Prussia Heidemarie Schwermer was the daughter of a successful businessman and her family kept a nanny and full-time gardener on their payroll. But when war struck Europe in 1939 for the second time that century Schwermer and her family became penniless and were forced to flee to Germany. Documentary: Heidemarie Schwermer says she is much happier after living without money for 16 years. She speaks of her experiences in a film entitled 'Living Without Money' After years of hardship Schwermer's father was able to start over with a tobacco company and cash started pouring in again. But Schwermer now found herself at odds with their affluent lifestyle. 'We were well-off but ended up as riff-raff,' she said. 'We became rich again and we had to defend it. I've always had to justify myself, whether we were rich or poor.' Schwermer, now 69, worked at a teacher and then a psychotherapist on a good wage. But instead of welcoming the hard-earned cash she yearned for those formative childhood years of struggle and strife. As a result she became obsessed with finding new ways to live without money, eventually setting up Germany's first exchange circle in 1994. 'Give and Take Central' helped people swap simple services like babysitting or house cleaning for tangible goods and Schwermer found she need money less and less. Eventually when a friend asked the divorced mother-of-two to house-sit for her Schwermer decided to take the plunge and live without money for one whole year. Life without means: The 69-year-old told how friends and acquaintances are happy to take her in . She sold everything - including her apartment - saving just a few small items that she packed into a suitcase. What . was only meant to last 12 months became her life for the next 16 years. 'I only wanted to try to do an experiment and in that year, but I noticed a . new life,' she told Business Insider. 'I didn't want to go back to the old life.' In the beginning Schwermer stayed with old friends but as word of her lifestyle spread she began giving talks on her mission - meeting new hosts on the lecture circuit. She only accepts train fare for her speaking engagements and rejects any other attempts to pay her. At first she also did odd jobs around her hosts' homes, like gardening or window washing, to earn . her keep but she says that these days they don't expect anything in return. Message: Schwermer works a lecture circuit giving talks about her alternative lifestyle. She only accepts money for her train fare and refuses all other types of payment . Happy: The mother-of-two only meant to live without money for 12 months but she felt so much better without material wealth that she carried on for 16 years . In a documentary made about her life entitled 'Living Without Money', she's seen foraging for leftover produce at fresh air markets and trading a shopkeeper a few hours of cleaning services in return for food. She often receives clothing from friends, donating what she doesn't have room for in the small suitcase she carts from home to home.","Heidemarie Schwermer grappled with a lifetime of guilt about wealth stemming from her time as a WWII refugee .

A Minnesota man has confessed and apologized for defacing a Montana monument, saying he did it out of love for his new bride who was dealing with a cancer scare. Cole Randall, 23, said it was just a misguided declaration of love when he carved a pair of names into the national monument Pompeys Pillar on October 10. In Randall's statement, released today, he confessed that his misguided judgement came to play when his honeymoon with Shpresa Lleshaj was cut short in October when she found 'a suspicious lump on her breast', the Star Tribune reported. Crazy in love: Cole Randall and Shpresa Lieshiaj, aka Flora Cash, visited Pompeys Pillar and left an inscription of their names on it . 'Senseless vandalism': Randall was arrested for creating this graffiti, found just three feet from the 1806 signature of Captain William Clark which made Pomeys Pillar a landmark . He wrote: 'I was scared... terrified . actually, worst-case scenarios raced through my mind. When love and fear . of loss team up, we sometimes lose our better judgment... if something . were to happen to my wife, I could come back to this place years from . now and see her and my names together.' Officials have to perform 'damage assessment' to the sandstone column before deciding if felony charges will be filed. The . monument also bears the inscription of the passage of the Lewis and . Clark expedition that explored the American West 207 years ago. Randall's letter said that he and Clark were both following an American Indian tradition of leaving their names. However, in 1991 the monument was purchased by the federal government and signs were put up prohibiting defacing the monument. Randall says he's prepared to face the consequences of his actions. National monument: Deputies were alarmed to find the carving so close to this historical etching, one of the last remaining pieces of physical evidence of the Lewis and Clark expedition . Cole . Randall and Shpresa Lieshiaj perform as folk duo Flora Cash. They were . questioned at Pompeys Pillar several weeks ago after setting off a . silent alarm. It wasn't . until a week later that a staff member inspecting the grounds noticed . that the monument, inscribed with Captain William Clark's signature in . 1806, had been vandalized. The carving reads ‘Cole + . Shpresa 10/10/2013’ with a love heart and was found by shocked deputies at . the famous monument in Montana. Randall ignored the warning signs, security cameras and railings. The . 1806 signature is one of the last remaining pieces of physical evidence . of the Lewis and Clark expedition, the first explorers to cross the . western region of America. Jonathan Peart, the director of Friends of Pompeys Pillar, told 3KRTV.com: . ‘This belongs to all of us - to you, to me to every American out there . and to deface this is just a senseless act of vandalism and violence to . something that has historical and cultural importance.’ A silent alarm alerted Bureau of Land Management (BLM) deputies that someone had climbed over the guard rail on October 10. Consequences: The couple were questioned after setting off a silent alarm but when the vandalism was discovered officials sought a more serious response . Historical importance: The man faces felony charges for defacing Pomeys Pillar (pictured), a 150-foot sandstone butte in the Yellowstone Valley . To remove the graffiti will cost between $4,000 and $5,000, according to the Friends of Pompeys Pillar. The monument is open to the public on foot every day of the year but barriers restrict visitor access to the signature. Captain William Clark scrawled his name and the date, July 25, 1806, on the 150-foot sandstone butte in the Yellowstone Valley after his return to America. The signature looks as it did some 200 years ago. The monument, 25 miles northeast of Billings, Montana, attracts some 50,000 every year. It was named a national monument in 2001. The Flora Cash Facebook site and blog have been disabled. According to the Billings Gazette, the monument was also defaced in June 2012.

Instead it turned into a terrifying jump-for-your-life situation for a group of experienced skydivers, who are lucky to be alive following a scary collision between two light aircraft above Wisconsin. And the entire thing has been caught on camera. Heart-stopping footage captured on the helmet cams of the some of the jumpers has been unearthed by an NBC News Exclusive following the crash on Saturday, in which one Cessna suddenly sandwiched atop another. The collision sent one of the planes off into fire-balling into the distance, which can be seen in the video. All nine skydivers involved miraculously survived by spontaneously jumping out seconds after the crash and landing safely on the ground. Scroll down for video .

Exact: This is the moment the two planes hit, sending two divers who were preparing to jump flying out of the aircraft . Falling: One of the divers tumbles out of the plane just after impact . Fiery: The cabin of the lead plane lights up in orange after its wing catches fire following the crash. This is the plane the pilot was able to use his emergency parachute to escape . 'We were just kind of lucky that we were at the point where we were out of the airplane,' said 64-year-old flight instructor Mike Robinson, who was in the lead plane. 'If we'd been back in the rear of the airplane when they collided it might have been a little bit different.' Both wings came off the lead plane in the collision and the pilot had to abandon the plane using a parachute on board. He was the only one with reported injuries, suffering from cuts as he exited the burning plane. The pilot of the other plane was able to pull out of a dive and land at Richard I. Bong Airport in Douglas County. One of the pilots and all nine skydivers will appear live in studio with Matt Lauer on the TODAY show tomorrow morning. Watch video here ... Once out of the plane, the parachuters had to  carefully maneuver their chutes to stay out of the path of raining debris.

'But then we open our parachutes, and now all . of a sudden they're falling faster than we are...Fortunately, eveybody . kept it together so they just avoided (the debris).'

'He may need some stitches, but he's not seriously hurt,' Mr Robinson said. Wisconsin skydivers: When asked by Matt Lauer if they would get back into a plane again after their miraculous escape, all nine put up their hands with one women admitting she is more afraid of spiders . Amy Olson, left, remembers the pilot screaming at them to 'Go!', ordering them to jump. 'That's probably the worst, was hearing him scream,' she said through tears. 'It's pretty raw.' Split apart: Both wings of the lead plane became detached and Robinson said he watched it crash to the ground in three pieces . Falling pieces: Several people in the Superior area reported seeing the plane falling to the ground but no one was injured by the debris . Miraculously, no one on the ground was injured by the falling wreckage - but plenty saw them crash to the ground.

I couldn't identify what it . was..it had a trail of smoke and I had never seen that before,' he said. Happy to be alive: Two people hug after all 11 aboard the two planes landed safely . Quick thinking: The pilot of the tracking plane was able to land it safely, but the lead plane was not so lucky. It crashed to the ground in several piece. The pilot of that airplane escaped by parachute as well . While .

As the beleaguered Motor City searches for help out of its deep economic holes, voters seem prepared to shake things up Tuesday by electing the first white mayor in 40 years. Former healthcare executive Mike Duggan, 55, is known for pulling Detroit's hospital system from the brink of bankruptcy and the 82 percent black city is poised to choose him over their history of choosing a mayor who looks like they do. If Duggan beats his African-American opponent, Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon, it will be a first since Coleman Young set a new precedent as the city's first black mayor in 1974. And the win appears likely. A poll released last week showed Napoleon lagging well behind Duggan, who also holds an almost 3-to-1 fundraising and spending edge. 'The White Guy': Mike Duggan, the leader of beleaguered Detroit's mayoral race, would become the city's first white mayor since 1974 if he's elected tomorrow . Though Duggan, who is a recent transplant to Detroit, is somewhat of an outsider, even a leader of black nationalist group New Black Panther Nation supports him. 'In the last two national elections, African Americans have asked the nation to choose the best person for the job and not get caught up in colour. And twice, Barack Obama has won,' said Malik Shabazz, who's known for leading provocitve protests and calls to violence against the white establishment. 'Now, in Detroit, in 2013, the best man running is a white brother, and that’s OK,' he said. Duggan's rise to prominence has been anything but typical. History: Detroit, an 82 percent black city, has a 40 year history of electing a mayor who looks like they do . Duggan would become the first white man to lead the city in 40 years. Here, the last four leaders of the Motor City are current mayor Dave Bing (top left); Kenneth Cockrel Jr, who was elected in 2008 (top right); former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who is now serving a 28 year prison sentence for corruption charges (bottom left); and former mayor Dennis Archer (bottom right) Only recently moved to Detroit from the outlying suburb of Livonia and even face pushback over his residency in the city during the primary. But instead of throwing in the towel, the former hospital executive mounted a write-in campaign and beat Sheriff Napoleon by 20,000 votes. Both Democrats have now advanced to the general election, which takes place Tuesday. 'A major part of why I have so much support is that everyone in the city understands that if you’re broke, you can’t deliver any services,' Duggan recently told the Washington Post. 'So I think there is a strong feeling in the city that we need a mayor who can balance the budget and operate the city well financially.' Trailblazer: Coleman Young became Detroit's first black mayor in 1974 and led the city for the next 20 years . Only, regardless of who the winner is, the next mayor of the city that became America's largest to ever file for bankruptcy in July will have very little power. Detroit is being guided through the filing by a state-appointed emergency manager, who must OK any requests for money made by the mayor. 'I think they're kidding themselves if they think they are going to regain financial control of this city,' said Detroit-based bankruptcy attorney Kenneth Schneider. 'Even after Kevyn Orr, there will be a financial advisory board that will maintain control of the city's finances indefinitely. The first part for any new mayor is to accept that and work with the state on how to right this city's finances.'","Over 80 percent black, Detroit has elected only black men to lead its city since Coleman Young's 20 years on the job began in the 1970s .

The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from a former Ku Klux Klan leader convicted of orchestrating the 1964 slayings of three civil rights workers in a case known as 'Mississippi Burning'. Attorneys for Edgar Ray Killen, who was convicted of manslaughter in 2005, had claimed there were violations of his constitutional rights during his trial, but a lower-court ruling found none. On Monday, the justices said they will not review these findings. Killen, now 88, was convicted exactly 41 years to the day after the deaths of Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman. He is serving 60 years in a Mississippi prison. Locked up: Edgar Ray Killen, pictured at his bond hearing in 2005, was convicted of orchestrating the killings of three men in 1964. On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal in his case . In 1964, Schwerner and Goodman, two white men from New York, came to Mississippi as part of Freedom Summer and worked with Chaney, a black Mississippian, to help register black voters. But when they went to investigate the burning of an African-American church in Neshoba County, they were ambushed by members of the Ku Klux Klan and shot dead before being buried 15 feet beneath an earthen dam. Their bodies were found in the dam near Philadelphia, Mississippi more than a month later after an intense search. The deaths were dramatized in the 1988 movie 'Mississippi Burning' which starred Gene Hackman and Willem Defoe as the two FBI agents investigating the killings. Victims: Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman had helped black people register for votes before they were kidnapped, beaten and killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan . Grisly discovery: Their bodies were found in an earthen dam in June 1964, more than a month later . In 1967, 18 men went on trial on . federal conspiracy charges in the deaths but despite evidence that . Killen orchestrated the killings, he walked free after a federal jury . deadlocked 11-1. Younger years: Killen, pictured in 1964, originally walked free because he was a preacher . At the time, the 12th, stand-alone jury member said she could 'never convict a . preacher'. But the jury convicted seven others, including Sam Bowers, who had ordered the killings. Two . decades later, in an interview that was to be sealed until his death, . Bowers said he was 'quite delighted to be convicted' and have 'the main . instigator of the entire affair walk out of the courtroom a free man' - referring to Killen. His remarks were revealed by The Clarion-Ledger in 1998 and sparked calls for a review of the case and to prosecute Killen. Killen, once a part-time Baptist . preacher, was the only person indicted in 2005 when prosecutors brought . the first state charges. He was indicted on murder charges but jurors were given the option to convict him of manslaughter, which they did. Killen's attorney, Robert Ratliff of Mobile, Alabama, did not immediately respond to a phone message on Monday. Killen's lawyers had raised several arguments in his appeals, including that his defense team didn't do a good job in representing him at trial in Neshoba County. On screen: 'Mississippi Burning', a 1988 film starring Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, was based on the killings . They also argued that his . constitutional rights were violated by the decades-long delay between . the deaths and his indictment, by variances between the charges in the . indictment and the jury's verdict, and by prosecutors' alleged failure . to turn over evidence that could prove his innocence. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate . in Jackson, Mississippi, and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals both . rejected Killen's appeals before the case went to the U.S. Supreme . Court.","Edgar Ray Killen convicted of manslaughter in 2005 for the deaths on Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman .

The 50th anniversary coverage of the Kennedy assassination on CBS News won't include the recollections of its longtime anchor Dan Rather, further proof of the lingering bitterness following Rather's messy exit and subsequent lawsuit against the network. Rather helped organize CBS' plans for President John F. Kennedy's visit to Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, and as a young reporter was a key component of assassination coverage. Now 82, with his own show on AXS-TV, he's one of the few reporters on the story that day who's still active in journalism. Former CBS news anchor Dan Rather says he hasn't been asked to be part of the network's 50th anniversary coverage due to his messy exit seven years ago amid a lawsuit . Rather, who later became CBS News' top anchor for 24 years, will appear on NBC's Today show on Nov. 22 this year. ‘I held off doing anything for anybody else for a while, thinking I may be asked to do something (for CBS),’ Rather said. ‘I can't say I had any reason for that hope.’ Rather worked at CBS News for 44 years. His downfall came as a result of a 2004 story about President George W. Bush's military service. Under criticism, the network concluded the story couldn't be substantiated, but Rather has stood behind it. His tenure as anchor ended six months later and he left CBS in 2006, eventually filing a $70 million lawsuit against his old employers that was thrown out in 2010 by New York's highest court. Rather helped organize CBS' plans for President John F. Kennedy's visit to Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, and as a young reporter was a key component of assassination coverage . CBS News said it wouldn't comment on Rather. CBS Washington bureau chief Bob Schieffer, who as a newspaper reporter in 1963 gave the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald a ride to Dallas after the assassination, will anchor a Nov. 16 special that traces CBS' coverage that day. CBS' announcement of Schieffer's special said ‘viewers are in the moment with legendary anchor Walter Cronkite and journalism's iconic reporters: Charles Collingwood, Harry Reasoner, Charles Kuralt and Mike Wallace.’ All of those men are now dead. ‘Setting my feelings aside about it, this is not a good idea to say we want to change the historical record so we're going to airbrush this guy out because we don't like him,’ Rather said. ‘They may want to control the way the public thinks about my record, but I'm pretty sure they have not been able to do that.’ Rather had no on-air assignment on the day Kennedy was shot, but he sprang into action when it became clear something had gone terribly wrong and then went on to become CBS News' top anchor for 24 years . Although Rather's name isn't . mentioned in the announcement, it's considered likely the Schieffer . documentary will include 50-year-old clips of Rather. As a young New Orleans bureau chief for CBS in November 1963, Rather had a mundane assignment in Dallas. He had arranged locations along the presidential motorcade route for film of the visit to be picked up and transmitted to CBS' New York headquarters. He had no on-air assignment, but sprang into action when it became clear something had gone terribly wrong. Rather described in his 1977 book, ‘The Camera Never Blinks,’ that CBS radio went with his report that Kennedy was dead - based not on official confirmation but his phone conversations with men who identified themselves as a doctor and priest at the hospital where Kennedy was taken, and a colleague's conversation with the hospital's chief of staff. It was an extraordinary risk: if Rather was wrong, he conceded his career in journalism likely would have ended there. Bob Schieffer, left, will anchor a Nov. 16 special that traces CBS' coverage of that fateful day 50 years ago, it will feature clip of legendary anchor Walter Cronkite . Days later, Rather was among the first people to see film of the assassination taken by Abraham Zapruder and he later described it live on CBS, reading from a spiral notebook what it captured of the president and first lady at the moment of impact. CBS failed, however, to acquire rights to the film. ‘I'm proud of what CBS News did at the time,’ Rather said. ‘When the country needed it, CBS News was the best in the business.’ Rather gave an extensive interview about what happened that day to his old competitor, NBC's Tom Brokaw, for use on Brokaw's NBC special to air Nov. 22.","Rather, 82, is one of the few reporters still active in journalism today who covered the 1963 shooting .

A 53-year-old Baltimore County woman has been sentenced to life in prison plus 40 years for hiring a hit man to gun down her husband at a gas station, in an intricate murder plot that involved multiple members of her own family. Karla Porter, of White Marsh, was convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy and solicitation following the shooting death of her husband, William Ray Porter, at the Towson Hess gas station he owned on March 1, 2010. A jury rejected claims that Porter concocted the scheme following years of physical abuse, with the couple's daughter testifying saying she had witnessed her father only 'verbally' abusing her mother. Porter admitted to paying Walter Bishop $400 to 'beat' her husband, denying that she wanted him dead. However police investigating the death of William Porter - initially suspecting it were a robbery gone wrong - were eventually lead to his wife after a man came forward claiming Karla Porter had 'repeatedly' asked him to kill her husband, which he refused. The man then approached police out of fear of being named a suspect in the murder investigation. Life plus another 40: Karla Porter will die behind bars after hatching a plan to kill her husband and following it through. The mother approached tried to contract two men before the third, Walter Bishop, agreed to do the job for $400 . Deceased: William Ray Porter was shot dead at the Towson Hess gas station he owned on March 1, 2010. Police initially suspected a robbery gone wrong . Scene of the crime: William Ray Porter was shot here, at the Towson Hess gas station he owned and operated, in March 2010. His wife has been found guilty of his murder for hiring the hit-man that killed him . Elaborate plot: Walter Bishop (centre) was the hit-man hired by Karla Porter (top left) to shoot her husband. However the scheme also involved Karla's sister (top right), brother (bottom right) and nephew (bottom left), all of which have been tried and are serving sentences . The court was told how Karla Porter approached another man as well before finally meeting with gunman Bishop, who was also convicted of first-degree murder. The murder scheme also involved Karla's sister, brother and nephew, all of which have been previously convicted and are serving sentences, according to CBS News. Prosecutors at the trial argued that Porter had no remorse for the killing, while the defense argued she was sorry and wasn't a threat to the community. 'There are two different faces of Karla Porter: she's the cold, calculated one she thinks nobody is looking at,' Baltimore County Assistant State's Attorney John Cox said. 'In public, she portrays as much different.' The victim's family described Karla as 'devious'. 'She's a very manipulative person -- very devious, I think,' Rick Porter, the victim's brother, said after the sentencing. 'It sounds weird for us to say that because she has been in our life for so long, but obviously she has lied and misled us, and she tried to continue this here just to cover her tracks.' 'We're glad the judge finally did see through that.' Being interrogated: Karla Porter denied ever have seen hit-man Walter Bishop when police showed her a photo of him during her first interrogation. She eventually broke down during the interview, saying: 'I didn't mean for any of this to happen.' Karla Porter, 53, seen here in a family photo, will now die in prison for hatching a scheme to kill her husband . Footage of Karla's first police interrogation has previously been released. In the video she is shown a picture of the hit-man she hired, but denies ever having seen him. Eventually she breaks down and says she 'didn't want any of this to happen'. She would later change her story, saying: 'I knew that Ray was going to kill me. I just wanted to kill him first.' This was the line Porter's defense team took in court. 'The gut reaction is we are disappointed by the sentence received by Karla Porter today,' said William Purpura, Karla Porter's attorney. '(The jury) needed to understand how domestic violence plays a part in what actions one takes to get out of a marriage. 'She testified clearly to the fear she felt throughout her life and fear she felt if she had left him. 'She's the first to say she is sorry this happened and wish it hadn't happened.' Judge Robert Cahill Jr. said he thought the level of deception before and after the murder was 'remarkable'. Cahill wanted Porter's sentence to serve as a warning that if you take matters in your own hands in domestic violence situations, you will pay with your freedom. Porter's defense team plans to file an appeal.","Karla Porter, 53, of Baltimore County, has been sentenced to life in prison plus 40 years for hatching the murder plot that killed her husband .

Jan VanBlarcom, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, sobbed as she recalled how she had no idea what had happened to her husband, 61-year-old Jay, when he failed to return home on October 4. Authorities had failed to notify her that he had been struck by a vehicle while crossing the street as he headed to nearby Cottonwood Mall to replace his broken phone. Scroll down for video .

Police said that Jay, whose full name is James, was carrying a driving license from out of state, which could have complicated the matter.

Coach Randy Burbach, from Corbett Middle School, organized the awards night at Jantzen Beach Hooters in the Portland area, but the choice of location quickly sparked outrage in the community. The Hooters brand is known for waitresses in skimpy uniforms, and the Facebook page for the Jantzen Beach restaurant is plastered with big-breasted, bikini-clad women. Scroll Down for Video .

In a letter to parents Monday, the school district's athletic director, J.P. Soulagnet slammed Burbach's poor judgement and said he tried to get him to move the dinner so 'families could attend and feel comfortable' but he 'was unyielding and emphatically said no.' As such, he could no longer support the coach. 'As a school district and athletic department, we do not support nor condone the decision to hold an end of season celebration at Hooter's for any of our teams,' Soulagnet wrote in the note. He said at least one athlete's family has refused to attend the event but the anger in the district was widespread.

'I believe this is a fine venue, Burbach told Oregonlive.com. 'It's not a strip club. If you have a dirty mind, you'll find dirt.' The coach said he will move forward with the party as planned.

A young Missouri man who has spent almost a decade in prison for a crime he says he didn't commit had his 40-year sentence vacated by an appeals court today. Ryan Ferguson was 19 when he was arrested for the 2001 murder of Columbia sports editor Kent Heitholt. His parents, Leslie and Bill Ferguson, who have tirelessly campaigned to have the conviction overturned, clapped and hugged as they read the decision of the appeals court online this morning. Relief: Bill and Leslie Ferguson heard that their son Ryan's murder conviction had been vacated this morning . Overwhelmed: Ryan Ferguson, pictured in prison, was told over the phone that his 40-year sentence had been vacated . According to the ruling today, the state . now has 15 days to decide whether he will face a retrial. If no . decision is made in that time frame he will be unconditionally . discharged. 'It's amazing,' Mrs Ferguson told CBS, which featured the case on 48 Hours. 'We're just really happy that finally we . have judges who looked at the facts in the case and ruled on that. They . did what was right.' Sports editor Kent Heitholt was found beaten and strangled by his own belt in his office car park at about 2.20am on November 1, 2001. Police had no leads in the case until two years later when Chuck Erikson, a heavy drug user, saw a photo fit he believed looked like him. Erikson, who had no recollection of his movements on the night Mr Heitholt died, told police he believed he and Ryan Ferguson, who had been out together in the area that night, may have been responsible. Ferguson has consistently denied he was involved but, despite no motive or  evidence linking him or Erikson to the crime scene, he was sentenced to 40 years in prison. In 2010 Erikson, who still has no memory of the night in question and is serving a 25-year sentence, said Ferguson was not involved. No evidence links the men to footprints, hair and finger prints at the scene, but police have not named any other suspects in the case. Ryan Ferguson, who is now 29, heard of the decision over the phone in prison. 'I kind of felt like I wasn't awake - been . dreaming of it so long,' he said. 'My reaction - it's not - wouldn't be like ""Yay . bouncing off the walls"", cause in reality I know it's the beginning of . another battle. Even though we crossed a huge hurdle, I don't feel like I . have my life back.' The cautious optimism of the young man is understandable for someone who was 21 when he was sentenced to 40 years for a murder his friend Chuck Erikson had . implicated him in, despite Erikson not remembering any details of the . night in question. Despite his consistent denials and no physical evidence linking him to the murder scene, Ferguson had his hopes raised and dashed by several appeal hearings. 'Under the facts and circumstances of . this case, we conclude that Ferguson did not receive a fair trial,' Judge Cynthia Martin wrote in a summary of today's ruling. 'His verdict is . not worthy of judicial or public confidence.' The decision was celebrated on the Free Ryan Ferguson Facebook page, with a post that read: 'Looks like we'll need to change the name of this page to ""Freed"" Ryan Ferguson.' The post 'liked' by more than 14,000 of the young man's supporters in just a few hours. Celebration: Details of the successful appeal were posted on the Free Ryan Ferguson Facebook page . Appeal: Ryan Ferguson has always denied that he was involved in the murder of Kent Heitholt . The details of his case have . concerned legal experts for years. An appeal last year was denied even . though a witness and Ferguson's alleged accomplice recanted their . confessions. November 1, 2001 . Kent Heitholt, sports editor of the Columbia Daily Tribune, is found . beaten and strangled in the office car park at about 2.20am. March 2004 Chuck Erikson is charged and arrested with murder and robbery after telling police he believes he may have been involved. March 2004 Ryan Ferguson is also charged and arrested but denies any involvement. December 2005 Ferguson is found guilty of murder and robbery and sentenced to 40 years in prison. November 2006 The first of several appeals is made and denied. November 2010 Erikson claims he acted alone on the night of the murder. October 2010 Witness Jerry Trump, a janitor at the newspaper, recants his statement. April 2012 Erikson and Trump both officially recant their witness statements at a hearing for Ferguson. October 2012 A judge denies Ferguson's habeaus corpus petition despite no evidence linking him to the case. September 2013 Ferguson's case goes back to the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals. November 5, 2013 The appeals court vacates Ferguson's sentence, paving the way for him to be freed within 15 days. Ferguson's . conviction was based on the testimony from witnesses Jerry Trump, a . janitor, and  Erikson, who feared he may have been involved after seeing . a photofit of the suspects. With . his freedom finally in sight, Ferguson's attention is now focused on . Erikson who implicated him and is serving 25 years for second-degree . murder. 'I believe he is totally innocent [too],' Ferguson told CBS. 'I don't see how he could have been at the crime scene. I just don't think it's possible.' Chief . Legal Analyst for ABC, Dan Abrams, said earlier this year that there . would be no evidence to convict Ferguson is a retrial is ordered. A . bloody footprint and hair found at the crime scene did not match him, . and the witnesses whose testimony his conviction was based on, later . admitted they had lied under oath. Ferguson has constantly proclaimed his evidence, ever since Erikson told police they had been involved in the crime two years after . Columbia Daily Tribune sports editor Mr Heitholt was discovered . strangled to death by his own belt in the early hours of November 1, . 2001. Erikson told police . the pair, who had been 17 at the time, had been drinking underage at a . nearby bar and that he could not remember what happened on the night in . question. After . reading a newspaper article about the murder he became convinced he was . involved, saying that a photo fit of a man seen near the scene looked . like him. In his police interviews Erikson, who . was a drug user, was unable to give details of the crime, wrongly . stating that Mr Heitholt had been strangled by a shirt, or a bungee . cord, before the detective questioning him tells Erikson it was a belt. He claimed however, that he struck the editor once, before Ferguson strangled him. 'The . police threatened me to implicate Ferguson or else I would be solely . responsible for Heitholt’s death and be charged with first-degree murder . and possibly sentenced to death,' Erickson said in an affidavit. Confess: A mug shot of Chuck Erikson, right, who said he was involved after seeing a photofit, right, in a paper . Memory loss: Chuck Erikson, who says he cannot remember the night of the murder, recently retracted his statement that Ryan Ferguson was involved . Despite fingerprints, a bloody footprint and other evidence found at the scene not matching Erikson or Ferguson, police arrested them. 'Everything is wrong about this case, . everything's wrong about it. It makes absolutely no sense,' Kathleen . Zellner, who worked on Ferguson's appeal, told the court. Ferguson stated to police that on the night Mr Heitholt was killed, he and Erikson had gone to a bar and then he drove them home. Tribute: Victim Kent Heitholt was the sports editor at the Columbia Daily Tribune and a father of two . Crime scene: The sports editor was leaving his office after 2am when he was strangled in the car park . Erikson is now saying that although he still has no memory of . the night in question, he believes he acted alone. Victim: Sports editor Kent Heitholt was found strangled in his newspaper's car park . Tribune janitor Trump, who said . he saw the young men at the scene, also later admitted under oath that . he had falsely identified them from a picture he was shown. In his police interview, Erikson said: 'I could just be fabricating it all and not know. This is after reading the newspaper article in October and this is kinda what I put together with what could've happened.' He went on to say: 'From there on I'm just presuming what happened. I'm making presumptions based on what I read in the newspaper.' According to the Columbia Daily Tribune, a key witness who was the last person to see the victim alive, was never thoroughly investigated. Fellow sportswriter Michael Boyd had left the office the same time as Heitholt, who was married with two children. He says that he drove off before Heitholt. The 1991 blue Oldsmobile he was . driving that night was never searched, and he traded it shortly . afterwards. Police have never been able to trace it. A forensic pathologist, Dr Larry Blum, has examined evidence from the trial for Ms Zellner, CBS said. He claims that the tire tool Erikson said he used to beat his victim did not fit the injuries. Campaign: Ryan Ferguson, left, with his father Bill and sister, Kelly, who are trying to have him released . Support: Bill Ferguson has constantly campaigned for his son's release and recently drove across the U.S. in a car featuring details of Ryan's case .

According to CBS Mr Boyd said he left the car park at about 2.20am, . only six minutes before 911 was called. Mr Boyd, who has always cooperated with investigators and denied having anything to do with the crime, told 48 Hours that he returned to . the car park later that night after hearing about the murder.

To see their children settle down and start a family of their own is a common desire among parents the world over. But while many know they can only nag their children about it, mothers and fathers in Shanghai have a more hands-on approach. Parents and relatives of unmarried sons and daughters take matchmaking into their own hands by searching for suitable partners at the 'wedding market' in the Chinese city's People's Park. Parents and relatives advertise their unmarried children at 'wedding market' at Shanghai's People's Park . Whereas men vastly outnumber women across China, in Shanghai the roles are reversed. Professional matchmaker's charge hundreds of pounds to desperate parents in a bid to find their unmarried daughter a suitor. Every Saturday and Sunday afternoon, parents flock to the park to peruse the hundreds of advertisements left there. Song Li, who founded an online dating . service, told CNN that, unlike the rest of China, there are almost three . times as many women looking for husbands or boyfriends. Therefore she charges more than £300 for women to join her service - but men can join for free. She said: 'There is a shortage of superior men'. Some parents at the park even admit their children do not know they are being advertised at Dating Corner. The market, set up in 2004, has a corner specifically for parents of children who live abroad. One mother said she goes to the market in search of a partner for her 36-year-old daughter who lives in Toronto. Some parents admit their children do not even know they are helping in the search for a partner (file picture) She told CNN she wants to find someone who is tolerant, open-minded and has a stable job for her daughter. However, she said: 'I can't give you my name because my daughter doesn't know I'm doing this and I don't want her to find out.' The small adverts hung from strings in the park cost about £2 and are displayed for five months. For an extra £10 fee, people are given access to phone numbers. The strips of paper consist of people's height, salary, age, job, education, home town and occasionally more details about their family values and personality. As well as parents, there are also professional matchmakers who make a living from trying to find suitors. The market has previously been described as 'match.com meets farmers' market' but it aims to help solve the gender imbalance. China's One Child Policy and the importance of family lineage both fueled the need for the market. Increasing numbers of educated, career driven women - of 'left-over women' - are also delaying marriage. Selective abortions because of the one-child policy means far more males are born than females - 118 boys to 100 girls. There are now 20million more men under 30 than women of the same age and the gender imbalance is continuing to widen .","The market is held twice a week at Shanghai's People's Park .

Outspoken: Author Louis de Bernieres claims that family courts treat fathers like 'sperm donors and bankers' Father's Day has become a day of sorrow and anger for many because family courts treat men like 'sperm donors', the best-selling author of Captain Captain Corelli's Mandolin has claimed. Louis de Bernieres, 58, argues that Father's Day goes by completely unnoticed by many children as a man's role in the family is being made to seem increasingly unimportant. And, on the annual celebration of fatherhood, he has slammed the courts for treating 'fathers heartlessly as mere sperm donors and bankers' and for always favouring the rights of mothers. He said: 'For too many men, Father's Day is a day of sorrow, frustration and anger, and for too many children it passes unnoticed.' The author, who has previously spoken about his own struggle to see his children after splitting from their mother, also blamed 'political incorrectness' for making a father's role seem irrelevant. He argued that the vital role of fathers is left out of literature for new parents and from teaching at school - instead concentrating on the importance of the mother. In a letter to the Sunday Telegraph, he wrote: 'In schools nobody tells boys that fathering is the most important and responsible thing they will ever do, nor that, when done well, fatherhood bestows upon you the deepest, most satisfying and fun relationships of your life. 'The only explanation for this neglect is terror of the political incorrectness of offending single mothers, and the general mythologising of fathers as irrelevant and feckless abusers.' In the spotlight: Mr de Bernieres has become a campaigner for fathers rights after speaking about his own difficulties in seeing his children after separating from their mother Cathy Gill in 2009 . 'Political incorrectness': The author, pictured at his London home where he makes guitars, claims that the role of fathers is left out of birthing and parenting material to prevent single mothers from being offended . He called for fathers to be included in . education about parenthood and for their role in 'children's lives to be . properly respected'. Mr de Bernieres has been campaigning for equal custody rights for fathers for several years after revealing he was left 'suicidal' after splitting from the mother of his children. Captain Corelli's Mandolin won the Commonwealth Writers Prize for Best Book and was translated into 11 languages before being made into a film . In 2010, the patron of Families Need Fathers (FNF) told how difficult it was for him see his young children, Robin and Sophie, after his 11-year-relationship with Cathy Gill, an actress and theatre director, broke down in 2009. In newsletter sent out by FNF, he said that mothers do not have a 'divine right to own the children' and called for equal parenting to be the normal arrangement for parting couples. He said: 'It was really dreadful. 'The worst thing, practically, was finding the house so quiet, because it was always so full of laughter and rampaging and stampeding. 'There was always a lot of noise and fun, and it suddenly went quiet. 'The emotional desolation is hard to describe. 'There were many times when I felt suicidal. One of the most extreme things you feel is a fantastically deep, bitter, anger at being treated so outrageously.'

Senior police last night condemned moves to allow foreign officers to take charge of British forces, a change which they said reflected a ‘paramilitary’ and European style of policing. Ministers are expected to open up the top ranks to candidates from countries such as the US, Canada and India to combat what they called an ‘insular and closed culture’. At the same time, middle managers from industry and the military will be allowed to enter the police at the rank of superintendent after intensive training. Open door: Under the new proposals Ministers are expected to open up the top ranks to candidates from countries such as the US, Canada and India to combat what they called an 'insular and closed culture' But the plans sparked fury among chief officers and staff associations. The Association of Chief Police Officers insisted there was no shortage of talent in the police and worried that existing officers would be frustrated in their efforts to seek promotion. Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘All chief constables have served on the beat, experiencing the reality of day-to-day operational policing with the public. ‘This is the model used by other countries who have followed the British system such as the US. ‘The direct entry officer class model tends to be followed by paramilitary police forces such as the French CRS or the Italian Carabinieri.’ Relaxing the rules will end the historic principle that all officers enter the police at the rank of constable. Those hired to become superintendents will undergo intensive training so they can be on the job within 15 months. Plentiful: The Association of Chief Police Officers insisted there was no shortage of talent in the police and worried that existing officers would be frustrated in their efforts to seek promotion . In addition, some graduates and other high-potential recruits will be fast-tracked to the rank of inspector. This could halve the amount of time it takes someone to reach the rank of chief constable – from around 25 years today. In theory it means someone who joins the police aged 19 could reach the top rank in their early 30s. The Home Office said applicants for the top jobs would most likely come from countries with similar policing systems such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US. Warning: Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police Sir Peter Fahy said: 'All chief constables have served on the beat, experiencing the reality of day-to-day operational policing with the public' It justified the measures on the grounds that new recruits could bring in experience of other working cultures. The policy document which contained the proposals stated: ‘When all the senior leaders in a sector have had only minimal exposure to other working cultures it may lead to a relatively insular and closed culture among those who reach the top of the organisation.’ The changes will help lure the ‘most talented people’ to join the police and attract the ‘brightest and best’, officials said. Policing Minister Damian Green said it would be ‘years not decades’ before a foreign national took charge of a force in England and Wales. He compared the moves to the decision to recruit a Canadian, Mark Carney, as the next Governor of the Bank of England. Derek Barnett, president of the Police Superintendents’ Association accused ministers of not valuing or trusting senior police leaders. He said: ‘The Home Secretary’s proposals send out a very strong message that the senior leadership of the police service isn’t valued or trusted or else she wouldn’t be wanting to bring in foreign police chiefs. ‘Bringing people in at superintendent level, inexperienced, unqualified, will bring some risks with them.’ In 2011, a row broke out within Government over the appointment of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. Some senior Tories pushed for the hiring of Bill Bratton, the former head of the New York and Los Angeles police departments, but Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the former Chief Constable of Merseyside, was appointed. The overhaul of recruitment rules was proposed by Tom Winsor in his review of police pay and conditions. They are likely to come into force later this year. Mr Green said bringing in new recruits would also allow forces to recruit more ethnic minority officers to senior ranks. He said: ‘The issue of choosing our police leaders is of the highest importance to the future of the police. There will be a relatively small number of people coming into the police from other backgrounds, increasing the diversity of the police.’","Ministers expected to open talks with candidates from US, Canada and India .

One of the officers injured during a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport was helping an elderly man escape gunfire when he was shot twice. Tony Grigsby, 36, who has been a Transportation Security Administration officer for nine years, was hit in the right foot during Friday's attack. Despite being wounded, he told NBC News his main concern was making sure the terrified people running towards him were okay. Courage: Tony Grigsby was shot twice in the right foot during Friday's attack at Los Angeles airport . Speaking outside his home, Mr Grigsby, who needed the help of a cane to stand up, said he was trying to help an elderly man get to safety when the gunman shot him. Mr Grigsby was a friend of Gerardo Hernandez, the officer who was killed. He fought back tears as he called Mr Hernandez a wonderful person who will be missed. The pair were joking about going on holiday together to Mexico before Mr Hernandez was shot dead. Mr Grigsby, who needed a cane to stand up, said he was trying to help an elderly man get to safety when the gunman shot him . Meanwhile, the school teacher shot when the gunman opened fire is recovering well according to friends and colleagues. Brian Ludmer is still being treated at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre and has to undergo one more operation. The 29-year-old is a teacher at Calabasas High School where he has worked in the performing arts department for 18 months. He was in Terminal 3 on Friday morning when the shots were fired. A bullet hit Mr Ludmer's leg which shattered two bones. According to Catherine Foss, principal of the school, he looked straight into the gunman's eyes as he fell to the ground but managed to find cover by dragging himself into a nearby cupboard. He found a jumper which he tied around his leg to help stop the bleeding. When the coast was clear he called for help. Two officers managed to haul him onto a wheelchair and Mr Ludmer was taken to hospital. According to Ms Foss, when Mr Ludmer came out of surgery all he kept saying was that he could see the gunman's face when he closed his eyes. Students at Mr Ludmer's school are planning to campaign against gun crime today. Authorities have said the man accused of opening fire at the airport achieved two his goals - to kill a Transportation Security Administration officer and show how easy it is to get a gun into an airport. The deadly rampage left investigators to piece together what motivated suspect Paul Ciancia's hatred toward the agency formed to make air travel safer after the September 11 terrorist attack. Ciancia was shot four times by airport police, including in the mouth, and remains heavily sedated and under 24-hour armed guard at the hospital. Brian Ludmer was shot in Los Angeles International Airport but is recovering in hospital . Teacher Brian Ludmer (left) who was wounded in the Los Angeles International Airport shootings with Las Virgenes School District Superintendent Dan Steponosky . The FBI said he had a handwritten letter, stating that he made the conscious decision to try to kill multiple TSA officers and 'instill fear in your traitorous minds.' Victim: Ciancia allegedly fired repeatedly at 39-year-old TSA officer Gerardo I. Hernandez, pictured, killing him . The unemployed motorcycle mechanic who recently moved to Los Angeles from the small, blue-collar town of Pennsville, New Jersey, had a friend drop him at LAX on Friday just moments before it is said he pulled a .223-caliber assault rifle from his duffel bag and opened fire, killing one TSA officer and wounding three other people, including two more TSA workers. Officials do not believe that the friend knew of the shooter's plans. Ciancia is believed to have arrived at the airport in a black Hyundai. He is facing charges of murder of a federal officer and committing violence at an international airport. The charges could qualify him for the death penalty. It was not immediately clear when he would make a first court appearance given his medical condition. In court documents and interviews, authorities spelled out a chilling chain of events, saying Ciancia walked into the airport's Terminal 3, pulled the assault rifle from his duffel bag and fired repeatedly at 39-year-old TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez. It is alleged that he went up an escalator, turned back to see Hernandez move and returned to shoot him again, according to surveillance video reviewed by investigators. He then fired on two other uniformed TSA employees and an airline passenger, who all were wounded, as he moved methodically through the security checkpoint to the passenger gate area before airport police shot him as panicked travellers hid in stores and restaurants, it is said. Fear: Terrified travellers run from gunshots at Los Angeles International airport on Friday, where Paul Ciancia is accused of opening fire at TSA agents . It wasn't clear why Ciancia targeted TSA officers but what was left behind indicated the gunman was willing to kill any of them that crossed his path, authorities revealed. It is believed Ciancia thought his constitutional rights were being violated by TSA searches and that he's a 'pissed-off patriot' upset at former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. 'Black, white, yellow, brown, I don't discriminate,' the note read, according to a paraphrase by a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. The letter also talked about 'how easy it is to get a gun into the airport,' the law enforcement official said. Targeted: Paul Ciancia, pictured, said in a note that he wanted to kill multiple TSA workers and show how easy it is to get a gun in an airport . When searched, the suspect had five 30-round magazines and his bag contained hundreds more rounds in boxes. U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday that Ciancia's actions show how difficult it is to protect travellers at a massive airport such as LAX. The terminals are open and easily accessible to thousands of people who arrive at large sliding glass doors via a broad ring road that fronts the facility and is designed to move people along quickly. 'It's like a shopping mall outside the perimeter, it's almost like an open shopping mall,' McCaul said. TSA Administrator John Pistole said the agency will need to work with each airport's police agency 'to see how we'll go about in providing the best possible security.' The shooting temporarily halted traffic at the nation's third-busiest airport, stranding thousands of passengers and causing dozens of flights to be diverted to other airports. More than 1,500 flights and 167,000 passengers were affected nationwide, according to the Los Angeles Times. On Sunday, flights at the airport were back on schedule and regular operations had resumed, LAX spokesman Marshall Lowe told the newspaper. The FBI has served a search warrant on a Sun Valley residence where Ciancia lived, Ari Dekofsky, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said on Sunday. Apartment: Police arrived at Ciancia's Los Angeles apartment, pictured, to check on him just 45 minutes after he'd left for the airport . Agents are still interviewing people, she said. Authorities believe the rifle used in the shooting was purchased in Los Angeles. Ciancia also had two additional handguns that he purchased in Los Angeles, but which weren't at the crime scene, a law enforcement official said. The purchases themselves appeared legal, although authorities were still tracing them, and it's unclear if the shooter used his own identification or someone else's, the official said. Near save: The family of the LAX gunman, Paul Ciancia, pictured, might have averted Friday's deadly shooting but they warned authorities moments too late, it has emerged . Instagram: Ciancia's gun was seen laying on the floor of the airport and Instagrammed by a witness . 'He didn't buy them on the street. He didn't buy them on the Internet,' the official said. 'He bought them from a licensed gun dealer - the rifle and the two handguns.' Hernandez, a three-year veteran of the TSA, moved to the U.S. from El Salvador at the age of 15, married on Valentine's Day in 1998 and had two children. The TSA said the other two officers wounded in the attack - James Speer, 54, and Tony Grigsby, 36 - have been released from the hospital. Two other people suffered injuries trying to evade the gunman but weren't shot.","Tony Grigsby, 36, has been a TSA officer for nine years .

A girl with severe learning disabilities was plied with drugs until she 'felt dead' while her teenage pimp passed her around for sex at a party, the Old Bailey heard. The victim, who can only be referred to as A, was one of five under-age girls allegedly abused by  a gang led by Zdeno ‘Skinny’ Mirga, 18, in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. She told a court how she was subjected to a string of abuses, including on one occasion being forced to perform sex acts on a dozen boys in a park while Mirga collected £20 a time. Zdeno Mirga, 18, (left) and Hassan Abdulla, 32, during their trial at the Old Bailey, Central London: The pair are accused of subjecting a 13-year-old girl with learning difficulties to a string of sexual abuses . In an another horrific episode, she was allegedly trapped by a much-older associate of Mirga, and his cousin, who abused her so severely that she vomited when the ordeal was over. The schoolgirl, who has learning disabilities and is partially deaf, had lost her virginity to Mirga in a park toilet when she was just 13 years old, jurors heard. In videotaped interviews shown to the Old Bailey, she accused the Eastern European teenager of forcing her to perform sex acts on him and other males in various locations, despite her objections that it hurt. Mirga, along with his brother, Dusan Mirga, 20, David Ziga, 19, and Hassan Abdulla, 32, deny a long list of sexual abuse charges ranging from rape to child prostitution. Four minors MH, 14, JK, 17, RB, 17, and JF, 14, are standing trial alongside them. The Kurdish, Czech and Slovak gang, who have to wear headphones and have interpreters in the dock to understand proceedings, are said to have targeted five young girls aged between 13 and 14 at the time of the abuse. The court heard that Abdulla had trapped A in his home and refused to let her leave unless she performed sex acts on him and his cousin. The court was shown an interview with police made in January this year, in which the girl - who is of Czech origin - said that Abdulla had threatened to hit her if she refused to obey his sick demands. She said that after both accused raped her and forced her to perform sex acts on them she was sick. The victim, who was allegedly abused by all eight defendants, told police she 'hated' and 'wants to fight' the female friend who would take her to Abdulla’s house, yet was never touched by him or his cousin. Shown left to right are Zdino Mirga, Hassan Abdulla, a custody officer, Dusan Mirga, and David Ziga: The victim, who can only be referred to as A, was one of five under-age victims allegedly abused by the gang . Earlier, jurors heard about a party A attended, where she was plied with drink and drugs until she practically passed out and was passed around by Mirga. Reliving the experience in April in a second video shown to the court, the youngster said she was first forced into performing a sex act on a a 50-year-old man for £20 before Mirga took her to the party in a taxi. There she performed sex acts on a further five 'boys', for which 'they gave skinny money', she said, adding: 'He was happy. He said if you don’t do it, I will slap you. I feel upset, I was scared.' During the videos shown to the jury, the youngster repeatedly told of times she was allegedly forced to allow associates of Mirga to rape her, while others laughed as they waited their turn. Many of the alleged abuses were said to have taken place in parks around Peterborough, where she described being sexually abused in bushes, on benches and on picnic tables. At the same park in Peterborough on a different day, Mirga tied the schoolgirl to a chair and threatened to steal her clothes and took her phone because she did not want to have sex as she was on her period. The court heard how his friends had laughed as Mirga used her own blue and white scarf to tie her up before raping her. Mirga allegedly threatened to hit the girl on other occasions if she did not cooperate as he wanted the money from pimping her out for 'weed and vodka'. The girl insists she was clear to the defendants that she was 13 at the time. Accused: The trial at the Old Bailey in London was told that Zdeno Mirga would collect £20 a time in exchange for allowing other males to perform sex acts on A, the spent the takings on 'weed and vodka' Mirga, who denies one count of causing or inciting child prostitution, eight counts of rape and two counts of sexual activity with a child relating to A. Abdulla is accused of four counts of rape, two counts of sexual activity with a child and two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity relating to A. He also faces a charge of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity relating to A’s sister, who was also 13 at the time. MH is accused of six counts of rape and two counts of sexual activity with a child relating to A. He is also charged with two counts of rape relating to C. JK is accused of four counts of rape and two counts of sexual activity with a child relating to A. RB is accused of three counts of rape and two of sexual activity with a child relating to A.

The mother of two boys aged four and two who died within months of each other had asked social services to take her children away, an inquest heard today. Shelley Adams of Southampton, Hampshire, called the local authority to plead for help four weeks before the death of her youngest child, Jayden. She told social workers that she couldn’t cope and wanted he and his brother to be taken away. Southampton General Hospital, where Shelley Adams's two sons, Jayden, two, and Bradley, four, were pronounced dead within two months of each other after she had begged social services to take them away . The boy had been on the 'at risk' register since the age of one over fears of neglect. But no decision was made to take him into care, the inquest in Southampton heard. In January 2011, two-year-old Jayden was pronounced dead at hospital having been admitted limp and unconscious. Just two months later, in April that year, his brother Bradley, four, was admitted to Southampton General Hospital suffering cardiac arrest, the inquest heard. He died three days later. Only hours earlier he had been deemed fit and healthy by staff at his nursery, while he was also seen less than an hour before being taken to hospital and appeared well. That incident involved a group of youths who saw Ms Adams putting the child outside on a step, where he was crying and upset. After Bradley's death Ms Adams was arrested on suspicion of murder. Detectives from Hampshire’s major crime department said they had had 'strong suspicions' of foul play. Detective inspector Dave Dilly, who led the investigation, told the inquest Ms Adams, who has learning difficulties, led a chaotic lifestyle and was heavily involved with social services throughout her life. But despite extensive enquiries the Crown Prosecution Service took the decision not to bring criminal proceedings against her. The matter was also thrashed out in the High Court over a considerable period of time, the inquest heard, because of ongoing care proceedings involving a surviving child. As part of that the judge, Mr Justice Baker, had to decided on the 'balance of probability' whether Ms Adams was responsible for the children’s deaths. He found that she was 'neglectful', she struggled as a parent, she dished out corporal punishment to the boys, put her own needs before those of Bradley and Jayden and struggled to provide appropriate food for them. He went on to say she was responsible for 'chronic neglect' despite receiving considerable support from social services and she was unable to cope with the demands of being a parent. He acknowledged there was ‘a significant possibility that the mother was responsible for the death of the boys’ but ruled that ultimately the local authority had not been able to prove on the balance of probability that she smothered either child. Southampton coroner Keith Wiseman recorded open verdicts on both deaths. He said there were ‘controversial circumstances’ surrounding the deaths of both boys that would have long lasting repercussions for those involved.","Shelley Adams called for help weeks before the death of her son Jayden .

Scroll down for video . Aid: Thai rescue workers and medics carry an injured tourist on a stretcher after a ferry sank off Pattaya . Shortly after the boat departed, an engine problem sent the passengers on the first deck rushing to the second floor, causing the ferry to flip on its side and eventually sink. ‘Witnesses said there were neither enough tubes nor life vests on the ferry,’ Col Suwan said. Some of those who cannot swim had to cling onto coolers or ice containers until rescuers came.’ He said the foreigners who died were a Russian man, a Russian woman and a Chinese man. Three Thais - two women and a man - also were killed. The rest of the passengers were rescued. Among these was a 12-year-old Russian boy who was tonight in intensive care at a hospital. None of the others were taken to hospital. Tragedy: Tourists react after six people were killed when an overcrowded ferry sank in eastern Thailand .

Bolstered: The surprisingly robust pace of recovery in recent months is a boost for George Osborne . Britain's economy is growing at its fastest pace for 16 years, a report revealed yesterday. In a sign that the recovery is gathering pace, figures showed the dominant services sector had clocked up its best month since May 1997. It came as a report in Brussels predicted the UK would be the best performing major economy in Europe in 2013, 2014 and 2015 - outstripping even the mighty Germany. The European Commission said Britain has ‘exceeded expectations’ this year and added that ‘the outlook is quite bright’ having ‘improved substantially since the spring’. Combined with upbeat surveys on manufacturing and construction, the services sector figures fuelled speculation that the economy will expand by as much as 1.5 per cent in the final three months of the year. That would be nearly double the 0.8 per cent growth rate seen in the third quarter of 2013 and outstrip anything seen since the turn of the century. The surprisingly robust pace of recovery in recent months has bolstered hopes that the economy is finally on the mend in a boost for David Cameron and George Osborne. Michael Saunders, an economist at banking giant Citigroup said: ‘Britain is booming’. The strong growth could force the Bank of England to raise interest rates sooner than expected in what would be a blow to millions of borrowers but relief to Britain’s army of savers. Rates have been pegged at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 and the Bank has said there will be no increase until unemployment falls to 7 per cent or lower - something it said in August it did not expect until late 2016. But it is due to publish far more optimistic forecasts next week in a sign that rates could rise sooner than previously thought. Unemployment is currently 7.7 per cent. Positive outlook: The European Commission (pictured) in Brussels said Britain has 'exceeded expectations' this year and added that 'the outlook is quite bright' having 'improved substantially since the spring' George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ‘The Bank could well be swayed into bringing forward the point in time that the unemployment rate hits the 7 per cent threshold. We forecast unemployment to fall to 7 per cent by end-2015 at which point we expect a rate rise.’ Financial research group Markit yesterday said its index of activity in the services sector - which accounts for more than three quarters of UK output - rose from 60.3 in September to 62.5 in October. That was the strongest reading since May 1997, the month when Tony Blair became Prime Minister, and well above the 50 mark that separates growth from decline. Markit said that combined with strong reports on manufacturing and construction, October was the best month for the UK economy since the start of 1998. Push: The strong growth could force the Bank of England (pictured) to raise interest rates sooner than expected in what would be a blow to millions of borrowers but relief to Britain's army of savers . David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which compiles the report with Markit, hailed ‘a sparkling start’ to the fourth quarter of the year. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said it put the UK on course for growth of 1.3 per cent in the final three months of 2013. But others were even more upbeat, with forecasting group Capital Economics and European banking giant ING predicting growth of as much as 1.5 per cent between October and December. The EC predicted growth of 1.3 per cent in the UK this year followed by 2.2 per cent in 2014 and 2.4 per cent in 2015 - outstripping Germany, France, Italy and Spain, the four biggest economies in the eurozone.","Britain's economy is growing at its fastest pace for 16 years, report reveals .

"PUBLISHED: . 11:56 EST, 5 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:02 EST, 5 November 2013 . A senior doctor at a private hospital has been convicted of killing a patient. Surgeon David Sellu, 66, was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter over the death of father of six James Hughes, following a trial at the Old Bailey. Mr Hughes, 66, died at the Clementine Churchill Hospital in Harrow, north-west London, on February 14, 2010. Sellu, of Hillingdon, west London, was found not guilty of perjury after he was accused of lying to the victim’s inquest under oath. James Hughes (right) was in excruciating pain, the Old Bailey heard. Although Dr David Sellu (left) knew his patient had a perforated bowel, . he failed to operate for 40 hours. Mr Hughes later died . Mr Hughes suffered an unexplained tear to his bowel after a routine knee operation at the privately-run Churchill Clementine Hospital in Harrow, northwest London. Sellu ignored concerns that Mr Hughes was in excruciating pain and failed to operate for at least 24 hours. Mr Hughes’ suffered blood poisoning as a result of the ‘exceptionally bad care’ and died of a heart attack on February 14, 2010. Sellu was convicted after a month-long trial at the Old Bailey. Following the verdict, prosecutor Bobbie Cheema QC read an impact statement from Mr Hughes’ wife Ann about the effect on her family. Mr Hughes died at the Clementine Churchill Hospital in Harrow, north-west London, on February 14, 2010 . Mrs Hughes said: ‘Jim was much loved and cared for by his family. His extended family phoned and visited him while he was in hospital. ‘The pathetic reassurances that everything was in hand were categorically wrong and left Jim totally victim to an inhumane environment. ‘Jim would have been better cared for if he had collapsed in a back alley.’ Miss Cheema said: ‘They weren’t given the full information they should have been and didn’t realise quite how difficult the situation had become. ‘They feel they were denied the opportunity to help Jim in any way. Their trust in the authorities has been shaken.’Mr Justice Nicol is to sentence this afternoon. Mr Hughes, a retired builder from County Armagh, Northern Ireland, was admitted to the BMI Healthcare-run hospital for a simple procedure to replace the knee joint. Miss Cheema said that Sellu should have prepared for the operation to repair the tear in the bowel as soon as possible. ‘Sellu took on the responsibility to care for Mr Hughes and the failure to arrange an operation as soon as possible was the first failing of that care,' she said. ‘The second is the failure by the defendant to ask for a CT scan urgently. ‘The third breach is the failure to prescribe antibiotics which every medical expert and the defendant now agrees were vital to fight the infection and should have been prescribed that night. ‘These areas demonstrate that the defendant was negligent - all the information was there for him to take the necessary steps.’ Although Sellu knew his patient had a perforated bowel, he failed to operate for 40 hours and did not go to see his patient. ‘The defendant failed to treat Mr Hughes’ condition even at that stage. He didn’t go in to see his patient’, Miss Cheema said. ‘He didn’t clear his list of non-urgent operations, nor did he arrange for another surgeon. ‘He didn’t ask the hospital to break into any other surgery list. ‘He did not ask the hospital to provide a suitable anaesthetist and he did not send Mr Hughes to another hospital by ambulance to be operated on urgently.’ By the time Mr Hughes was brought into theatre, he had been in pain for over 40 hours and was in a critical condition. Mr Hughes even had to call a doctor friend from his hospital bed because he could not explain to the Hungarian doctor on duty the agony he was in. He died the following day. ‘Had Mr Sellu simply operated the night before, or even early during the day of the February 12, Mr Hughes would have had a very good chance of survival. The Old Bailey heard that Mr Hughes was in so much pain he called a doctor friend from his private hospital bed because he could not explain to the Hungarian doctor on duty the agony he was experiencing . ‘There was a series of missed opportunities and serious errors of judgment in his care of this patient and they combined to cause Mr Hughes’ premature death and the standard of care was exceptionally bad,’ Miss Cheema said. Elizabeth Joslin, a specialist lawyer for the Crown . Prosecution Service, said: 'James Joseph Hughes was in hospital for knee . surgery when he, by chance, suffered a perforated bowel . 'David Sellu's lack of care fell far below the expected . standard, with terrible consequences. 'Prosecution of doctors for gross negligence . manslaughter is rare and the threshold for criminal prosecution is high, but . this doctor's actions were not mistakes or errors of judgment, but negligence . so serious that he has now been convicted of a criminal offence. 'Our thoughts are with the family of Mr Hughes.' During the inquest into Mr Hughes’ death Sellu was called to give evidence and written statements and lied about when he had first seen the results of the CT scan, which he had delayed. When his evidence on that point was examined against electronic hospital records they showed that he had first looked at the records no earlier than 9pm, not lunchtime as he had said. The inquest was adjourned without reaching any verdict. Sellu insisted he was not told Mr Hughes’ condition had rapidly deteriorated overnight two days before he died, but ordered emergency surgery as soon as critical results of a CT scan had arrived. He was a senior lecturer in surgery at Imperial College from 1993 to 2000 and is an associate professor at a Florida University. He denied manslaughter and perjury.","David Sellu ignored concerns that James Hughes was in terrible pain .

The men asked to take the dog, Titch, for a walk before throwing him into their van. Rhiannon Jones, 27, says she was run over by a couple of thieves who stole her French bulldog puppy, Titch . Ms Jones said she tried to stop them but was knocked down by their van and tried to cling on as they drove off. ‘The men seemed genuine - I didn’t expect them to try and steal Titch,’ she said. ‘When I went after them, the men, who I had been speaking to only moments earlier, came at me. ‘I was lifted off the road and on to the bonnet of the car - I was clinging on to the van as it sped round the corner. ‘They’ve got no windscreen wipers now - I ripped them off.’ The University of South Wales student said she loved the dog, a present from her boyfriend, but realised she was going to have to give him up because of how much time she would be spending outside of the house for her sports science course. The third-year student put the dog up for sale on PreLoved, a classified listings website. Ms Jones chose to put Titch up for sale when she realised she would not have time to care for him at university . The men phoned and came to visit the dog at her home in Aberdare, South Wales. They asked to see a certificate to prove Titch was five-generation pedigree and, while Rhiannon was looking for it, they tried to make off with the dog. She ran out of her home to confront them in the street but was hit by their red minivan as they drove off. Ms Jones was comforted by neighbours before going to Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. Police are now tracing the dognappers after the owner, who was not seriously injured, reported the incident.

Kenneth Price, 75, was left with serious injuries after the animal gored him with its antlers. Paramedics operated at the scene before he was airlifted to hospital. Despite further surgery, Mr Price died five days later. Mr Price died after being gored by a male deer during rutting season on Mountain Hall farm near Saron in Wales . The lifelong sheep farmer had . diversified into breeding deer for venison more than five years ago, it . is believed. His widow Doreen, 73, was yesterday being comforted by . friends and relatives. Mr Price was a leading sheep judge who was a . regular at the Royal Welsh Show. David Pittendreigh, regional chairman . of the National Sheep Association, said: ‘Kenneth was a super, super . man. It’s a real tragedy. ‘He had started farming deer. It’s the . rutting season with the stags. It’s a real shame.’ Stags are usually . cautious around humans, but during the autumn rutting season they become . more aggressive and territorial. A friend said yesterday: ‘Many . people will miss him as he was a prolific showman of his prizewinning . sheep and was always at the Royal Welsh.’ Deers are usually shy animals which will avoid humans but during rutting season males will become aggressive and territorial . Mr Price was attacked in . the  middle of the deer rutting season on his farm, Mountain Hall, at . Saron, near Llandysul, Wales. A spokesman for Wales Air Ambulance said: . ‘The patient sustained multiple serious injuries. He was anaesthetised . and surgery was performed on the scene by the helicopter crew. 'On arriving at hospital he was critical but stable.'Despite receiving yet more surgery at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, Mr Price passed away yesterday. An investigation into Mr Price’s death will be formally opened by the Swansea coroner. The farmer was operated on at his farm before being airlifted to hospital . The Health and Safety Executive said it was aware of the incident and was making initial inquiries. Deer are usually cautious animals, but in rutting season, which runs . from October to early November, males become more territorial and . aggressive. It in not known if the injuries to Mr . Price were caused by a red deer, which has sharp, branch-like antlers, . or a fallow deer which has broader, flatter ones. Yesterday . Dave Goffin, of the British Deer Society, said of stags: ‘Normally they . are quite timid animals and they would normally flee if they saw . someone. However, during the rutting season their testosterone levels . shoot up.’ Fallow deer's antlers change colour and harden in the build up to the rut in anticipation of being used as a weapon to fend off rivals. Males will adorn themselves with bracken, roll around in their own urine, and then fight each other in an attempt to attract a doe to mate with. They will also make distinctive mating noises which range from bellows and shouts to low grumbles in order to find breeding partners. The Royal Welsh Show, at which Mr Price was a judge, is an annual event held every July in Llanelwedd, near Builth Wells, in Powys. It was set up by the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society and is one of the largest agricultural shows in Europe.","Kenneth Price was gored by a deer last Wednesday .

A Labour donor and close friend of Tony Blair paid almost £40million in bribes to secure business contracts worth billions, a court was told. Victor Dahdaleh, 70, is accused of passing money to a member of the Bahraini royal family in exchange for huge aluminium contracts. The Jordanian-born metals magnate allegedly issued orders for the payments using a fax machine at his home in Belgravia, Central London. Dahdaleh is also accused of paying the company's chief executive Bruce Hall around £3million in bribes until he left the business in 2005 . One of the alleged recipients was . Sheikh Isa Bin Ali Al Khalifa, the minister of oil and industry and . chairman of state-owned Aluminium Bahrain BSC (Alba). Another was Alba chief executive Bruce Hall, 61, who received £3million in kickbacks which he spent on luxury property. Prosecutor . Philip Shears QC said the bribes were paid over eight years up to 2006 . to win business for companies in which Dahdaleh had an interest. He told Southwark Crown Court: ‘Corruption on any scale, particularly such as this, destroys the fair market place.’ Dahdaleh . has been close to Labour for years, pouring money into party causes and . enjoying a warm friendship with Mr Blair and Lord Mandelson. Opening the case at Southwark Crown Court, prosecutor Philip Shears QC said: 'This case is about corruption. It is corruption, we suggest, on a very large scale. 'In a nutshell our case is that over the course of about eight years between 1998 and 2006 this defendant, Victor Dahdaleh, made corrupt payments totalling the Sterling equivalent of about £40million to the chairman Sheikh Isa Bin Ali Al Khalifa and the Chief Executive Officer Bruce Hall, of one of Bahrain's largest companies, Aluminium Bahrain BSC (Alba). 'These payments, we say, were corruptly made in order to win business for companies who hoped to trade with Alba. 'During that period Mr Dahdaleh was engaged in negotiations with contracts made between Alba and companies in which he had an interest in respect of the products and components associated with the production of aluminium. 'You will hear that many of the instructions to banks to make corrupt payments were made by Mr Dahdaleh in London, using a fax machine which clearly bears his details, so most of the fraud was carried out here.' He added: 'It is clear there was no legitimate purpose for such payments to be made by Mr Dahdaleh. 'Corruption on any scale, particularly on this scale, is such that it destroys the fair marketplace. 'Companies who are prepared to engage in such unlawful conduct get an unfair advantage over competitors and prevent honest and hard working companies from conducting business on an equal footing.' The trial is is expected to continue into next year at Southwark Crown Court. The businessman denies all charges . The court heard Alba accounts for 10 per cent of Bahrain's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and nearly 70 per cent of its non-oil exports. Its shares are three quarters owned by the Bahraini government. As chairman Sheikh had a 'significant influence' over contracts awarded by Alba, it was said. But as the UK has no extradition treaty with Bahrain the Sheikh could not be made to stand trial here, jurors were told. Mr Shears said the payments were largely made or received through companies controlled by Dahdaleh and the Sheikh. 'It is pursuant to a criminal conspiracy,' he added. Dahdaleh, has dual Canadian and British citizenship and lives in Belgravia, central London, was questioned about the payments by the Serious Fraud Office in 2010 but made no comment. He later claimed the money transfers were made in respect of sponsorship payments to the Bahraini government. But the prosecutor said there was no such practice in Bahrain and such acts 'were not only unheard of but unlawful.' Dahdaleh, who has hearing problems and was allowed to sit outside the dock, denies six counts of corruption, one of conspiracy to corrupt and one of transferring criminal property. The case, which is expected to go into next year, continues.

A 16-stone trucker left his girlfriend needing surgery after bundling her down the stairs in a row over having to cook his own dinner. Logan Welch, 34, was so angry when his tea was not on the table when he came back from a long day behind the wheel that he started an argument that rumbled on all through the evening. The row ended with victim Chantelle Pearson fleeing her home in Ipplepen, near Newton Abbot, and seeking refuge with neighbours after falling down the stairs. Exeter Crown Court was told Logan Welch was so angry when his tea was not on the table when he came back from a long day behind the wheel that he started an argument . She suffered a knee cartilage injury which needed keyhole surgery to repair and left her needing crutches for three months, Exeter Crown Court was told. Welch, who now lives in Exeter, admitted causing actual bodily harm and was jailed for nine months, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay £1,500 compensation and £1,000 costs. Recorder Mr James Freeman also made a restraining order banning him from any contact with the victim for five years. He told him: 'There was an argument which ended up with you struggling with the victim at the top of the stairs, which is a dangerous place to have an argument. 'She fell to the bottom and twisted her right knee and she fled the house, coming back with the neighbours. It seems you calmed down and left her house the next day for good.' Mr Joss Ticehurst, prosecuting, said the incident happened in May of last year and started when Welch came home from work. He said: 'He is a long distance lorry driver and was upset by the domestic situation and finding that his dinner was not ready.' He said the row simmered for the rest of the evening and flared up when the victim was in the bath and he went in and tipped her washbag into the water. A further argument ensued which Miss Pearson said included him pushing her several times and causing her to fall down the stairs. Mr Andrew Maitland, defending, said Welch did not accept he pushed her but took responsibility for the fall and the injuries. He said the incident was caused not just by him having to cook his own dinner but by Welch believing his partner had not kept a promise to drink less and spend more time on domestic duties. He said they had run up debts of around £1,500 and he had agreed to work longer hours but felt she was not keeping her side of the bargain. Mr Maitland said Welch had also fallen during the incident and claimed a dent in the wall at the bottom of the stairs was the result of his 16 stone weight as he landed on his shoulder.","Logan Welch, of Exeter, Devon, was handed suspended jail sentence .

A Royal Marine accused of executing a severely-wounded Taliban prisoner made a ‘dreadful mistake in a corner of a foreign field,’ a court martial heard. The 39-year-old commando, who can only be identified as Marine A, shot the captured Afghan fighter in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol, the trial was told. The experienced sergeant, a 15-year veteran who served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, claims he thought the insurgent was already dead. Marine A is on trial with two comrades, identified as Marine B and C, who allegedly helped and encouraged the killing of the detainee during a patrol in Helmand. File photo . Seconds after the pulling the trigger he told comrades he had ‘broken the Geneva Convention’ - but insists the remark referred to him desecrating a corpse, not killing an injured detainee. In a closing statement to the court martial Anthony Berry QC, defending Marine A, said the serviceman was ‘fine, battle-hardened, tough and devoted’ with an ‘unblemished character’. Mr Berry said: ‘If he made a dreadful mistake in a corner of a foreign field while commanding his men it was not, we suggest, murder he committed. ‘He thought the Taliban was dead when he discharged his pistol and that is the end of the matter.’ Marine A is on trial with two comrades, identified as Marine B and C, who allegedly helped and encouraged the killing of the detainee during a patrol in Helmand on September 15, 2011. All three deny murder. Film footage of the shooting, captured on a camera mounted on the helmet of Marine B, has been played to the hearing in Bulford, Wiltshire. The seven-strong court martial board has been told that Marine A’s unit, part of 42 Commando, went on patrol almost every single day during its six-month deployment in the warzone. Up to 20 comrades had already been killed or maimed by Taliban bombs and bullets by the day of the incident. Some victims’ blown off limbs had been hung in trees by insurgents as ‘trophies,’ the court heard. The victim was found with an AK47 assault rifle and grenade after an Apache helicopter blitzed him with cannon fire following an attack on a British base. The court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, continues . The suspects allegedly dragged the terribly wounded insurgent out of view of a British surveillance balloon and the circling gunship before Marine A shot him. All three later claimed the Apache caused his fatal injuries. Mr Berry said Marine A had fired a bullet into the apparently dead insurgent because of a ‘lapse of control’ in a stressful deployment. He said the unit, based at Command Post Omar in Nad-e Ali, a Taliban stronghold, was operating in an ‘inhospitable environment with a wicked and brutal enemy’. ‘You might at any moment step on a mine, you might be shot at, blown up in a car or blasted by a grenade… It is hard to expect soldiers in these circumstances to act with a degree of circumspection.’ Marine B, a 31-year-old university graduate, has been accused of plotting to kill the severely-injured man, pretending to give him first aid while watching for the helicopter has left the scene so the ‘coast was clear’. But his barrister Martin Meeke QC said prosecutors had ‘failed to find the evidence’ that the commando was allegedly part of a murder plan. He said: ‘It is not an offence to be present when an offence is committed, nor of standing by and not taking steps after a crime is committed.’ Mr Meeke said if Marine B had been aware that the insurgent would be shot, he would not have continued to film the alleged slaying on his helmet-mounted camera. ‘If he knew what was going to go on would he have allowed it to go on recording, or would we have had him saying again, “Let’s switch this f***** off”?’ The court martial continues.

A group of students have been banned from wearing sombreros and fake moustaches at a fancy dress night because they might be perceived as racist. A sports team at the University of Birmingham had hoped to dress as Mexicans at a Halloween party until a union official told them they would not be allowed in with their costumes. Students have criticised the ban as 'heavy-handed political correctness gone mad', as it also emerged that one person was denied entry to a party because he was dressed as the 'Native American' member of the Village People. Ban: Students have been barred from club nights at the University of Birmingham Guild of Students, pictured, because their fancy dress outfits were deemed offensive . Earlier this year the university's student union, the Guild of Students, announced a clampdown on 'all forms of oppressive and discriminatory behaviour' at its club nights. Since then, undergraduates have been barred from events simply because of what they were wearing, while the hit song Blurred Lines has been banned because of its 'distressing' content. University basketball player Carl Raynsford, 21, told The Tab student newspaper that last Saturday his team were not allowed to attend an Halloween event dressed in stereotypical Mexican outfits, after the union's 'anti-racism and anti-fascism officer' objected. 'We were dressed as Mexicans which involved only a sombrero and a poncho and potentially a drawn-on moustache,' he said. 'I'm not sure why it's deemed racist, nor why the 'anti-facism officer' needs any involvement. 'Would I be offended if someone came as an Englishman?' Racist? Union officials ruled that a sombrero was an unacceptable outfit for a night out (file photo) Vicki Harris, vice-president for sport at the union, wrote to the team saying: 'Dressing up as Mexicans would not be OK since it could be seen as imitation of a culture and relate to a stereotype about the race of that particular ethnicity group, even if the intention is by no means harmful at all. 'We are in the process of creating some guidelines which will offer more direction but in the meantime if you have a back-up theme I would recommend going with that instead. 'From speaking with venues you would be asked to take off Mexican-related fancy dress items before coming into the guild.' Third-year student Jonathan Blausten says he was also refused entry to the Guild's club night when he dressed as a fictional character from a made-up Middle Eastern country. In an open letter, the 21-year-old wrote: 'I was refused entry dressed as Admiral General Aladeen from The Dictator, because my costume was ""racist"". Unacceptable: Another student was dressed as the 'Native American' from the Village People, pictured . 'I'm still waiting to hear who I was offending, going as a character from a fictional country in a movie which parodies almost every country on earth with no particular bias. 'Last night, I met someone who had gone to Fab with his housemates. They had all gone as the Village People - he just happened to be the one dressed as the Native American, wearing a head dress. 'He was thrown out of Fab for being ""racist"". I'm still waiting for the Guild to ban the YMCA.' The union said in a statement: 'The Guild has a zero tolerance policy against all forms of harassment to include racism, ageism, sexism, ableism, and homophobia and transphobia. It is believed that some fancy dress can be deemed offensive when considering the zero tolerance policy. 'The Guild would like to reiterate that this policy has been put in place with students' interests and safety at the heart of its decision. 'We do however understand that there has been some confusion with fancy dress themes and we are working on clearer guidelines to help inform students’ decisions, as well as a wider campaign to raise awareness on these issues.'

A patient who had overdosed on pills after breaking up with his girlfriend died after doctors allegedly failed to give him urgent liver treatment, an inquest heard. Anthony Seddon, 30, who had split up with his girlfriend, took a lethal dose of painkillers which had been prescribed for a stranger. But doctors allegedly failed to return an emergency call for him to undergo a potentially lifesaving liver transplant at a specialist unit and he died the following day. As he lay dying at Tameside Hospital in Greater Manchester staff urged that he be transferred to a specialist liver treatment unit 70 miles away at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham - only for no one from the centre to call back, a coroner heard. Anthony Seddon, 30, took painkillers and was found slumped on the floor before being taken to hospital . The hearing in Sale was told the musician, from Ashton-under-Lyne, suffered with bipolar disorder for 12 years. He was a keen walker and cyclist but he started to become bloated after a course of medication. His mother Donna Thomas told the inquest: 'He had never had any issue with his weight before. He reminded me of Forrest Gump - he would just run and walk and walk and cycle everywhere. 'He never had a weight issue until the last two years or so and that affected him massively.' The tragedy occurred last March after Mr Seddon was found slumped on the floor of his flat by a friend after swallowing a concoction of prescription drugs through the night. Mrs Thomas said: 'We knew he was very vulnerable because of the relationship but he was lucid for hours afterwards. 'We took one look at him and he was a funny colour. It was obvious it hadn’t just happened. 'He was very calm and told us exactly what he had taken. He let us phone the ambulance.' Anthony Seddon's sister Alex Newman (left) and aunt Bev Marsden have been left devastated by his death . Dr Vinod Patel, a consultant Gastroenterologist from Tameside Hospital told the hearing: 'I got involved with his care straight away. 'The drugs were already damaging his liver at a rate of knots. Nothing in the body will clot at that stage because the liver is effectively dying. An Anthony Seddon Memorial Fund has been set up to raise money to provide schoolchildren in Manchester with education on mental illness . 'His blood pressure was also low. At this point his prognosis was extremely poor.' A specialist unit in Leeds was called, but they had no space for Mr Seddon, so a unit in Birmingham was contacted. Dr Patel said; 'When a person is this bad you know there is a space of about 24 hours where they could die. At this point the damage to his liver was quite serious. 'Without a liver transplant his prognosis was extremely poor. 'But we didn’t get a response back from Birmingham until he had passed away. 'They should have called back. We expected them to call back that afternoon.' However, Dr Patel later appeared to indicate that he had had contact with the Birmingham unit. He told the inquest: 'Birmingham told us to carry on as we were.' Det Insp Richard Ennis of Greater . Manchester Police who investigated Mr Seddon’s death said he had not . known that the empty boxes of tablets were prescribed to a woman. He added: 'There was nothing left at the house in terms of a note which would often happen in a suicide. 'In . terms of trying to establish intentions with this case we must note . that he was alive and talking when police arrived and I am aware from . the notes that he made comments regarding splitting up from his . girlfriend and the fact he wanted to be with her in spirit and that gave . us a reason as to why he took the tablets. 'It may have been a cry for help. He said he had taken them as a spur of the moment decision so there was no prior planning. 'I agree that it was an impulsive act.' The hearing in Sale was told the musician, from Ashton-under-Lyne, suffered with bipolar disorder for 12 years . Mr Seddon was a keen walker and cyclist but he started to become bloated after a course of medication . The inquest was adjourned until December for further inquiries to be made. After the case Mr Seddon’s mother Donna Thomas, said: 'If anything from today can help the situation then we’re willing to wait to work out exactly what happened surrounding his death. 'But we know there’s nothing else that could have been done to save him. We did have concerns about some things and we do think some things could have been done better.' Since their son’s death, they have set up the Anthony Seddon Memorial Fund to raise money to provide schoolchildren in Manchester with education on mental illness. They have already raised more than £7,500 since he died. Mrs Thomas added: 'Since he died we have been inundated with calls from families whose children may be just starting with similar symptoms and they are so relieved that there is somebody out there talking about it. 'People think everybody will be like Anthony but he was very extreme. 'He was very poorly and most of the people we come into contact with are not as severe as Anthony.

Defence: NHS England chief Sir David Nicholson said six-figure salaries were needed to attract 'top drawer' managers . Hospital bosses deserve their six-figure salaries because their jobs are some of the most complex in the world, the head of the NHS claimed today. Sir David Nicholson warned it was wrong to ‘denigrate’ trust chief executives who can earn more than £200,000 –a-year. And he sought to blame ministers for the rising pay bill putting pressure on the health service, claiming endless reorganisations by successive governments created even more highly-paid roles. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has vowed to veto pay rises for senior staff at health quangos under his control, including NHS England, to set an example to the rest of the health service. But he does not have the power to intervene in pay deals offered by individual health trusts. Latest figures show that hospital chief executives saw their pay soar by 121 per cent between 1997 and 2010, almost twice the rate of increase enjoyed by nurses. Earlier today Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of NHS England, said managers deserve their the huge salaries needed to attract ‘the right calibre’ of job applicants. Appearing before the health select committee today, Sir David was warned the remarks risked angering frontline doctors and nurses because it sounded like they did not deserve pay rises in the same way. Challenged over the remarks, Sir David said the NHS is going through ‘some of the biggest, most significant transformational change in the NHS and really do need top-drawer people to do that’. The chief executive of NHS England, dubbed the ‘man with no shame’ for his defiance in the face of criticism, called for an end to complaints about six-figure salaries in the health service. ‘If you constantly denigrate and criticise them, it’s hardly surprising that they respond to that,’ he said. ‘We all have a responsibility to support those people in incredibly difficult jobs. They absolutely are highly paid jobs. ‘They are amongst the most complex and difficult jobs in the world. ‘Those chief executive jobs - the complexity of those are on a scale managerially that most of us would have difficulty to understand.’ Warning: Labour MP Barbara Keeley said the spectacle of NHS bosses defending huge salaries because managers 'deserve' them would leave doctors and nurses facing pay freezes to think they do not . He claimed the latest reorganisation ordered by the coalition – scrapping primary care trusts and replacing them with GP-led clinical commissioning groups – were in part to blame for the pay levels. ‘I have been in the NHS for 35 years. I have only applied for a job once that was not associated with a reorganisation. ‘If people would stop constant reorganisation the NHS would have less turbulence’ With major increases in NHS spending unlikely over the coming years, the total pay bill will have to be controlled, he said. ‘There was a system set up by the government - not by me - signed off by ministers which appraised every job through an external evaluation and put a salary against and that’s what people have got. ‘We should not surprise by the salaries that people have got. People deserve the pay that the system that was set up identifies they should get. Labour MP Barbara Keeley repeatedly challenged him about the remarks, warning it sounds like ‘people at the very top on very significant salaries think they deserve it as if other people don’t’. Jobs: Frontline health staff will have be cut to fund pay rises for managers, the Department of Health has warned . The government has warned that doctors and nurses will have to be axed to fund further pay rises for NHS managers. The . quality of patient care would suffer as a result, the Department of . Health claimed as ministers prepare to block salary hikes for senior . officials. In a submission to a pay review body, the DoH said: ‘Any increase in pay costs above this level will risk unfeasible reductions in clinical staff which may harm the ability to maintain access to and quality of NHS services to the public.’ Warning: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says the NHS could lose public confidence if it does not curb pay rises . The average salary of a hospital chief executive now £164,000 a year, compared to the Prime Minister’s pay packet of £142,500. Even without a freeze in pay, salaries are still expected to ‘drift’ upwards because managers are given automatic increase rises linked to length of service. Mr Hunt has warned the NHS risks losing public trust if it does not curb a BBC-style ‘culture of excessive pay and pay-offs’. He added: ‘In this tough financial climate, I am determined to see real restraint on executive pay so that every penny possible can go on patient care. ‘Sadly, the last government got their priorities completely wrong on NHS pay – giving managers far bigger rises than nurses.’ It comes after it emerged a husband and wife who worked as NHS managers were paid nearly £1million in redundancy money – only to be rehired by the health service within weeks. Karen Straughair, 50, pocketed more than £605,000 when NHS South of Tyne and Wear, where she was chief executive, was wound up at the end of March. Her husband Chris Reed, chief executive of NHS North of Tyne, was paid more than £345,000 when his organisation was abolished. By June both had board-level jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust – Mr Reed as interim chief executive, Miss Straughair as recovery director. Jamie Reed, Labour's shadow health minister, said: 'Under David Cameron, many NHS managers have seen their salaries soar. Meanwhile, nurses have had theirs frozen and six thousands nursing jobs have been axed. 'David Cameron's NHS re-organisation siphoned £3 billion from patient care budgets. He ignored the warnings and wasted millions on redundancy payments for managers, many still in the NHS. 'Ministers have placed the NHS on the brink of its worst winter in a decade and posturing like this does nothing to help.' Golden goodbye: Karen Straughair pocketed £605,000 and Chris Reed was given £345,000 redundancy . Analysis of Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities’ final accounts, published last week, suggests payouts in excess of £100,000 were made to more than 50 staff. More than a dozen of these well-paid chiefs have since found work in the public sector. The National Audit Office estimated in the summer that 10,000 people had lost their jobs at a total cost of £430million. At the time, the NAO said that 44 very senior managers were made redundant at an average cost of £277,273 . Labour has accused the Government of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds by replacing the statutory bodies with 211 new Clinical Commissioning Groups. But the Government blamed lax contracts drawn up under Labour, saying their ‘hands were tied’.","Sir David Nicholson blames ministers for endless reorganisations .

A convict who secretly swallowed handcuff keys was busted when a full-body X-ray scan revealed they were lodged inside his chest. Ramon Eduardo Mendez Fialho somehow got hold of the bunch and consumed them shortly after being sent to prison in Montevideo, Uruguay, last week. It was reported that he hoped to excrete them and either use them to escape next time he was cuffed or to sell to other inmates. But Mendez didn't realise that bosses at Santiago Vazquez prison had recently upgraded their security and had installed a state-of-the-art X-ray machine. Eagle-eyed officers soon detected a foreign body inside the convict's stomach after he had passed through the scanner. On closer inspection the image, which has been released by the Interior Ministry, showed two tiny keys designed to open handcuffs.

Millions of professionals should face mandatory drug testing at work, Britain’s most senior police officer has suggested. Anyone who failed a test and refused help to get clean should lose their job, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner said as well as ‘robust’ policing of dealers, action was needed to discourage the demand for illegal substances. He said testing could take place in ‘all occupations’ but cited in particular teachers, intensive care nurses and transport staff. Drug testing: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has said professionals in 'all occupations' should face random tests, but in particular teachers, intensive care nurses and transport staff . Workers: Sir Bernard said employers who discovered a staff member abusing drugs would not have to turn 'informant' and tell the police (file picture) In a speech to the all-party parliamentary group on cannabis and children, Sir Bernard said drug testing and the fear of losing their job would act as a deterrent for drug users. He said: ‘It seems to me we have got to plant in people’s minds something to affect the demand as well as supply. You can think of many occupations where if you were working with a colleague you would want to be sure in fact that they were drug free.’ Employers who discovered a staff member abusing drugs would not have to turn ‘informant’ and tell the police, he added. Anyone caught with drugs in their system should be offered help to stop, he said – but anyone who refused that help should suffer ‘consequences, which would probably be about their employment’. The suggestion that workers should be drug tested is likely to cause outrage among trade unions. It will also raise civil liberties concerns. In America, however, random drug testing is already prevalent – and widely accepted – in workplaces, with staff tested in the retail, financial, manufacturing, education and health sectors. Companies say that the tests are not just carried out for safety reasons, but also to identify theft risk, employee reliability and improve productivity. During his speech, Sir Bernard told the group of his concerns that parents born in the 60s and 70s when cannabis was weaker are failing to warn their children about the dangers of super strength skunk. Speech: Sir Bernard told the all-party parliamentary group on cannabis and children that he had never smoked the drug and had only smoked one cigarette, when he was seven years old . He said the potency of cannabis has increased five-fold in the last half century but many parents were unaware of the damage it can do to young brains. Teenagers who smoke new powerful strains of skunk run the risk of developing schizophrenia in later life, and must be told they are taking a ‘major’ health risk. Tests: Random drug testing in America is already prevalent - and widely accepted - in workplaces . Sir Bernard warned any move away from a ‘robust’ approach would lead to even younger children taking the drug and even more serious damage to their health. His hard line approach also marks him apart from other senior officers who in recent years have called for a more relaxed approach to enforcing drugs laws, especially around cannabis. As Chief Constable of Merseyside, Sir Bernard was credited with adopting a zero tolerance approach known as ‘Total Policing’, which included a relentless crackdown on drug dealers. Sir Bernard told the group he had never smoked cannabis and had only smoked one cigarette, when he was seven years old. His comments on Monday night are at odds with a series of parliamentary reports in recent months calling for a more permissive approach to drugs. First the home affairs select committee called for cannabis to move from Class B to Class C. Then, the all-party parliamentary group for drug policy reform called for possession of heroin and ecstasy to be decriminalised. Campaigner Mary Brett, of charity Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘It is refreshing to hear a senior police officer who is deeply aware of the dangers of today’s cannabis. It is also reassuring to hear one who is unafraid of enforcing the law and taking on drug dealers.’","Professionals should face drug testing, says Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe .

Some councils have shaved the rates that they pay companies to care for the elderly and frail . Firms which care for the elderly are being forced to break minimum wage laws due to a lack of council funding, the head of a government body has warned. Some councils have shaved the rates that they pay companies to care for the elderly and frail, David Norgrave of the Low Pay Commission revealed. Mr Norgrove told the Guardian that the scaling back of funding was so quick that firms have managed to avoid paying the £6.31-an-hour minimum pay rate. He claimed that the commission has been told that Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has identified 120 care providers for investigation. To cut costs, care companies are allegedly using tactics such as not paying for travel time between care visits, so that they don't have to pay the minimum wage. United Kingdom Homecare Association estimates that a homecare company needs to be paid a minimum of £14.95 an hour by a council to fulfill wage law and training responsibilities. But it believes that one in five councils were now paying £11 or less, the lowest being £8.98 an hour. The association said that 90 per cent of councils had slashed its members payments in the past year, leaving them struggling to comply with the minimum wage law - the alternative being they stop trading or go out of business. Norman Lamb, the care minister, told the newspaper that he had asked the Care Quality Commission to see whether staff who work more hours than they should for less than the minimum wage could guarantee that they received care to a high standard. The minister accepted that there are far too many employers paying people less than the minimum wage by not taking account of travel time, which was unacceptable. It comes after a poll in September revealed that more than a quarter of care home residents are treated no better than children at meal times. David Norgrove said that the scaling back of funding was so quick that the firms have managed to avoid paying the £6.31-an-hour minimum pay rate . And nearly as many families say their relative does not get enough help with eating and drinking. The YouGov poll, of 1,588 people, found that 28 per cent of those with a relative or a friend in care said that they had sometimes been treated like children at meal times. Research chief James McCoy said: ‘With so many residents needing help with their meals, staff in homes need to make sure they are treated in a professional and sympathetic manner.’ The findings come seven years after Tony Blair’s government launched guidelines for care home and hospital staff demanding patients and residents be treated with dignity. It also follows the Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly campaign which has highlighted the mistreatment of care home residents. More than half of the families questioned said their loved ones needed help to eat and nearly half said relatives needed help to drink. But 15 per cent of families with relatives currently in care said they were not getting enough help to eat. Of those with  relatives in care over the past five years the figure was 26 per cent. The numbers were similar in respect to liquids. Despite this, 53 per cent said care home food was better than that at NHS hospitals. The findings come after it was revealed four out of five councils have restricted home help to those who are 'critically' in need of it.","HMRC has identified 120 care home providers for investigation .

The huge animal, estimated to be 50ft in length and weighing several tons, has been spotted numerous times just off the beach at Caister-on-Sea  in the last few days. Local fishing crews believe the whale has been lured in close to the coastline by huge numbers of herring - which it is feasting on. Unusual visitor: A humpback whale, pictured, has been seen off the coast of Norfolk for the first time . One fisherman, Dick Thurlow, a former lifeboat coxswain, said: 'There’s a massive amount of herring out there - we’re out there for the same reason - to fill our boots. 'The conditions are perfect, and the herring I’ve seen this year are probably the best I’ve ever seen and I’ve been fishing since I was 14. 'They’re mature, full of roe. I think they come back to where they were hatched to spawn. They should be there for the next week or so if the weather doesn’t change. 'We’re getting them while we can, and I guess he is too.' At one stage the whale came within 90 . feet of a fishing vessel, which had Mr Thurlow's son Arron on board, and . surfaced five or six times. The east coast fishermen are no strangers to marine creatures - often coming across seals, porpoises and sometimes pilot whales. But sharing the waters with a vast humpback whale means they must be extra vigilant. Feast: The animal, spotted off the coast of Caistor-on-Sea, pictured, is thought to be feeding on schools of herring in the North Sea waters . Staying put? Experts said the animal could stay for the duration of the winter if there is enough fish . Mr Thurlow said: 'You don’t want to get one of those in the nets. 'We use drift nets and if we accidentally . catch a seal or a porpoise, which happens sometimes, it’s not too hard . to get them out before we do any harm. 'I’m not sure we could say the same with a whale. It’s a big, big animal. The first thing we saw was the blow coming out the water, and you can smell it.” While the Norfolk whale seems to be alone, . humpbacks are known to feed using an unusual technique called bubblenet feeding. The technique sees groups of the animals work together to capture large schools of fish. Each . whale has its own role in the process. One blows bubbles around the . school to keep the fish from escaping, while others make noise to scare or . confuse the fish and help bring them to the surface. Finally, others herd . the fish together and force them upwards. Once . the fish are at the surface, all the whales lunge upwards with their . huge mouths wide open and try to gulp as many fish as they can.

The gap between the numbers of rich and poor pupils going to university 'remains large' a damning report has warned. New figures suggest that a teenager's chances of going to university still depend heavily on where they live, their background and their gender. Aspiring pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds would need to treble their enrollment figures to match those from wealthier areas, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) reported. Aspiring pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds would need to treble their enrollment figures to match those from wealthier areas (posed) And the financial pressures of university fees are effectively freezing out potential British postgraduates, which has led to their foreign peers outnumbering them in UK higher education institutions, another study showed. In areas of the country where few students go into higher education, women were over a third (35 per cent) more likely to go than their male peers. In the late 1990s, teenagers living in areas of England where high numbers of students went into higher education were four times more likely to study for a degree than those living in areas where few people chose to continue their education. By 2011/12 this had narrowed with those living in 'high-participation' areas three times more likely to go to university than those in areas of 'low-participation'. But the report adds: 'Young people in the most disadvantaged areas would need to treble their participation rate in order to match the rate of those from the most advantaged areas.' Professor Les Ebdon, director of fair access to higher education, said he was pleased to see 'sustained progress' in the numbers of disadvantaged students going to university. Figures show poorer UK students are becoming less and less likely to apply for higher education because of a lack of financial support . But he added: 'Young people from the most advantaged neighbourhoods in England are still three times more likely to go to higher education than the most disadvantaged young people. 'Meanwhile, there has been a 40 per cent decline in part-time study over recent years, which is worrying because part-time students are more likely to come from groups that are currently under-represented in higher education. 'Addressing these complex issues requires universities, colleges and schools to work together, engaging across the learner's whole lifecycle. 'This means encouraging children from an early age to think about higher education as an option, supporting teenagers as they make key decisions, and working with employers to reach out to potential mature students. It's also vital that policy is joined up across all education sectors.' Despite the gaps, a rising numbers of . young people are choosing to go to university, with women more likely to . study for a degree than men, the HEFCE figures show. More . than a third (38 per cent) of those who were 18 in 2011/12 went into . higher education, up from three in 10 (30 per cent) of those who were . the same age in 1998/99, according to data published by the HEFCE. The . data looks at the proportion of school leavers going on to university, . taking into account their sex, background and home town, from the late . 1990s up until 2011/12. The . findings show a 26 per cent increase over this period in the proportion . of 18-year-olds continuing their education beyond A-levels and . equivalent qualifications, with most of the rise happening from the . mid-2000s onwards. HEFCE's . report says that by 2011/12, women were, on average, over a fifth (22 . per cent) more likely to attend university by age 19 than men. The gap is most distinct in the capital, with 18-year-olds in London the most likely group to go to university, with the rift between the proportions of teenagers in the city and those in the rest of the country widening, the study shows. By 2011/12 youngsters in London were over a third (36 per cent) more likely to go into higher education than those who were the same age in the late 1990s, and were around 43 per cent more likely to go than young people living in the North East, the region where teenagers are the least likely to continue their education beyond A-levels. The findings show that the areas where youngsters are the least likely to go to university tend to be along the coast, in rural parts of the South West, the East Midlands and the East of England as well as in former industrial towns in the Midlands and the North of England. Meanwhile, foreign students have outnumbered their UK counterparts in postgraduate education at British universities since 2008, a report revealed today. International student numbers have soared by 90 per cent in the past decade while the number of home-grown students has fallen by 12 per cent in the past three years, a report by the 1994 group of universities said. There may be a future crisis as there will be a dearth of skilled British professionals, the Independent reported. Instead, universities could teach the UK's economic rivals skills they would use to compete against Britain. Figures show poorer British students are becoming increasingly less likely to apply because they do not have financial support.","Gender, background and where students live affect chances of going to uni .

The Cabinet Office has been told to avoid sending lengthy emails when a quick phonecall would be more efficient . Civil servants have been instructed to ditch their emails for some old-fashioned face-to-face communication, after officials found their inboxes were 'bombarded' with unnecessary messages. Lengthy emails could easily be replaced by quick phonecalls and make their communication a lot more efficient, a new management strategy has found. Cabinet Office officials have been told to stretch their legs and directly speak to colleagues while any online messages between internal workers have been outlawed on 'no email Thursday'. The plan to speed up communication is a strategy introduced by Stephen Kelly, the Government's chief operating officer and former Nasdaq executive. In a video message he told staff his reasons for making them down their keyboards, the Daily Telegraph reported. 'I got in pretty early this morning and I was absolutely overwhelmed and bombarded with the inbox in front of me. 'Obviously, for external stakeholders we have to respond, and respond promptly. 'But internally, let's just get out of our seats and walk around the office and sort stuff out together informally by chatting and having meetings rather than sending long, long, long arduous emails.' Perhaps it is a good thing that officials are now resorting to direct communication, following one minister's damning criticism of the Government's IT system. Francis Maude grew so fed up with Whitehall’s ‘clunky and rubbish’ system he had his own personal wi-fi network installed. He became frustrated at the time it took to log on to government systems and wanted to use his iPad instead for non-sensitive material.

But the Cabinet Office minister was astonished to find that a multi-million contract signed by the Labour government did not include providing an easy wireless web access usually found in coffee shops. He now wants civil servants to use ‘off the shelf’ computers and mobile phones to cut costs and speed up the way they work. The coalition has grown increasingly irritated with the way Whitehall buys and uses technology. A study found civil servants waste the equivalent of three days a year waiting for their computers to turn on. Mr Maude was forced to take matters into his own hands when he could not get his phone or iPad to work in his Whitehall office. He preferred not to use a high security computer issued by contractors under the Labour deal because it involved entering numerous passwords and could not use it to surf the internet properly. Instead he had a wi-fi system installed in his office overlooking Horse Guards Parade so he can bypass government systems and use his iPad to go online. In June Mr Kelly also revealed his frustrations with Whitehall’s IT: 'I came into the office and I pressed my PC and it took me seven minutes to boot up. 'That's government in the old world, that's three days of the year I waste of my time booting up,' the Standard reported. 'I think the average cost of a desktop [computer] a year is about £6,000. You could go and buy 10 iPads a year.'","Cabinet Office officials told to down their keyboards on 'no email Thursday'

And it would appear that Pope Francis is following up on his promise, by expelling a German bishop from his diocese pending the outcome of a church inquiry into his 31 million-euro (£26.4million) new residence complex. The Vatican didn't say how long Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst, 53, would spend away from the diocese of Limburg but it refused calls to remove him permanently. It gave no information on where he would go or what he would do. Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst (left) has been expelled by Pope Francis following the spending of some 31 million euros on a residence . At the centre of the controversy is the huge price tag for the construction of a new bishop's residence complex and related renovations. Tebartz-van Elst has defended the expenditures, saying the bill was actually for 10 projects and there were additional costs because the buildings were under historical protection. But in a country where Martin Luther launched the Reformation five centuries ago in response to what he said were excesses and abuses within the church, the outcry has been enormous. The perceived lack of financial transparency has also struck a chord since a church tax in Germany brings in billions a year to the German church. Tebartz-van Elst's leadership style has also been criticised. In August and September, more than 4,000 people signed an open letter to the bishop criticising what they considered his authoritarian style. People walk past a part of the residence of Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst, Bishop of Limburg, in Limburg, Germany . The head of the German bishops' conference, Archbishop Robert Zollitsch, has been particularly blunt in his criticism of the expenditures and the credibility problem it was causing the church. He said the 'decisive' turning point came when Hamburg prosecutors earlier this month asked a court to levy an unspecified fine against the bishop for false testimony in a related case. Zollitsch has said the church commission will investigate the costs of the renovation, the financing and how decisions about the restoration evolved. Canon lawyers will determine if Tebartz-van Elst violated church law regarding the use of church money, Zollitsch said. In a highly unusual move, Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst of Limburg was ordered to leave his diocese while an investigation and audit into cost over-runs is held . In a statement , Zollitsch pledged that the commission would do its work 'quickly and carefully.' Francis' decision opens 'a space to return to inner calm and create a new basis for talks,' he said. The Vatican stressed that Francis took the decision based on 'objective' information, suggesting that the Vatican wasn't being swayed by the popular outcry. Francis has also made it clear he expects his bishops to live simply, setting as an example his own humble lifestyle. Tebartz-van Elst met with Francis on Monday. Tebartz-van Elst's leadership style has also been criticized . Yesterday the Vatican said the bishop was leaving pending the outcome of a German church investigation into the expenditures and his role in the affair. Fellow bishops and lay Catholics in the diocese, however, expressed doubt that he would ever be able to return. 'This is a crisis of confidence that will be hard to overcome,' said the dean of the cathedral chapter, Guenther Geis. Limburg's vicar general, the Rev. Wolfgang Roesch, who had been due to start January 1, will instead begin work immediately and will run the diocese during Tebartz-van Elst's absence, the Vatican said. Germany's main lay Catholic group, the Central Committee of German Catholics, praised the decision. 'Pope Francis' decision offers the chance of a first step toward a new beginning in the Limburg diocese, because the situation had become an increasing burden for the faithful there and in all of Germany,' said Alois Glueck, the group's head. The German government refused to comment on the matter. Franz-Josef Bode, bishop of Osnabrueck, said the pope had made a 'smart' decision which gives all concerned time to review the situation calmly. But in comments to the German newspaper Die Welt, he cast doubt on Tebartz-van Elst ever returning to Limburg. 'There is a fundamental crisis of confidence in Limburg. The situation there is a mess,' Bode was quoted as saying.","Vatican didn't say how long Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst, 53, would spend away from the diocese of Limburg .

It could be proof that their game of hitting a ball with a stick bears more resemblance to golf than the Scottish, who claim that golf derived from their game of hockey. Scotland has long declared itself to be the home of golf. It claims that the games goes as far back as the 15th century when, the game of ‘gowf’, as it was known in those days, was banned by Parliament under King James II, who branded it as a distraction from military training. The ban was lifted when the Treaty of Glasgow came into effect in 1502. However, the earliest form of golf can be traced back to the Roman game of paganica, where players used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball .

Disgraced politician Bo Xilai has lost his appeal against his conviction and life sentence for corruption and abuse of power. A court upheld former Politburo member Bo Xilai's convictions for embezzlement, bribery and abuse of power and sentenced to life in prison. State broadcaster CCTV showed Bo in court wearing a black jacket over a white shirt, faintly smiling as he stood flanked by two tall uniformed guards, his uncuffed hands clasped in front of him. Bo, a former party boss in Chongqing, was convicted last month for embezzlement, bribery and abuse of power and sentenced to life in prison . The court said Bo's offences 'led to extremely severe social consequences and caused major damage to the interest of the country and the people,' according to the ruling on the case posted on the court's website. The senior politician's downfall began when a senior aide, Wang Lijun, defected to a US Embassy and revealed details of a murder committed by Bo's wife, Gu Kailai. In August 2012 a Chinese court convicted Gu of the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood, whom she was said to have killed with poison in a hotel in 2011 after a business dispute. She was handed a suspended death sentence last . year that will probably be commuted to life imprisonment. Bo, who was once tipped for a top role in Chinese government, was then dismissed from his political office and investigated for corruption. His supporters maintain that he is the victim of a political purge. Bo Xilai's downfall began when it was revealed that his wife Gu Kailai was involved in the death of British businessman Neil Heywood . Neil Heywood's body was found in a secluded Chongqing hotel in November 2011 . As party boss, Bo led a crackdown on what he called mafia activities, but what critics say was in part an excuse to arrest wealthy private entrepreneurs, torture them into confessing to crimes then jail them after summary trials and seize their assets. A prominent lawyer who sought to defend a businessman was put in jail. 'Bo Xilai controlled the police, prosecutors and courts in Chongqing and he cannot avoid responsibility for the wrongful convictions that took place there,' said Li Zhuang, the lawyer who had been jailed in the anti-gang crackdown. 'As long as there is no redress, it's difficult to put a full-stop on Bo's case.' Charges focused on how Bo took £2.1 million in bribes from two business associates, embezzled government funds and abused his power in handling his wife's murder case police chief's defection. Bo fought to defend his reputation as a clean, upstanding model official who rode to popularity exploiting public anger with government corruption. He said he could not be held responsible for crimes that his wife committed without his knowledge and said he was betrayed by his right-hand man. The court rejected Bo's defenses and sentenced him to life in prison on the bribery charges, 15 years for embezzlement and seven years for abuse of power. The final decision is the latest in one of China's most politically charged trials in decades. Today's ruling enables Chinese President Xi Jinping to further unify party leaders who may have been divided over how Bo's fate should be handled and to steer public focus toward the initiatives of the team he leads. Topping the agenda are a meeting of party leaders in November to draw up a blueprint for economic development and an anti-corruption effort that has been the hallmark campaign of Xi's leadership so far. 'Xi Jinping is anxious to put together at least a semblance of unity among the different factions,' said Willy Lam, an expert on Communist Party politics at Chinese University in Hong Kong. 'He wants to shift the attention of the public and the Western media from something negative to something more positive.'","Former Politburo member Bo Xilai has lost appeal against his conviction and life sentence for corruption and abuse of power .

Thief: Diane Caswell has been barred from 27 stores because of her 13-year shoplifting campaign . A shameless mother of three has been banned from stores in five different towns after waging a 13 year campaign of shoplifting. Diane Caswell, 38, would get the bus or train to high streets across the North of England and fill numerous bags with clothes, cosmetics and toys. The former school cleaner has racked up scores of theft convictions and has has been in and out of jail since being first convicted in 2000. She was hauled back into court and made subject of her second ASBO on Monday after CCTV images showed her with two girls filling four bags with toys during a thieving spree at 16 stores. After her arrest Caswell said: 'I hate what I am.' Today Lancashire Police said Caswell had been barred from a total of 27 stores in Blackburn, Clitheroe, Nelson, Darwen and Accrington. She is also not allowed to go into Blackburn's town centre shopping area unless it is for pre-arranged dental appointments for herself, or her children, or to go to meetings with her solicitors and the probation service. The ASBO will last for two years and Caswell will face up to five years in jail if she is caught breaching it. Caswell began her shoplifting spree when she was single and bringing up her three children. She stole designer clothes from a store in Burnley complaining that she could not afford for her daughter to go on a school trip. She said her eldest child had also wanted designer clothes and she was not in a position to provide them. In October 2000 she was given a conditional discharge but she went on a prolific thieving spree and was later given her first ASBO banning her from Blackburn's shopping area. No entry: Lancashire Police said Caswell had . been barred from a total of 27 stores in Blackburn, (town centre is pictured) Clitheroe, Nelson, . Darwen and Accrington . No go: Accrington (pictured) is among the towns with shops that Caswell is banned from. She would get the bus or the train to high streets across the North of England and fill bags with clothes, cosmetics and toys . But in 2010 she was back before the court . after she flouted the order when security staff spotted her in a budget . store in the town. Caswell, from Blackburn, was later arrested again then bailed with a condition not to enter shops or stores only to go on a further shoplifting spree within 48 hours stealing toys and greetings cards. Last March Caswell was caught again stealing £300 worth of mascara from a Boots store after travelling to Skipton in North Yorkshire, with friends. She went to jail and was treated at Styal women's prison for addiction but after being released went shoplifting at 16 different stores. Caswell is banned from stores in Nelson (pictured) too. She was handed a second Asbo on Monday after CCTV images showed her with two girls filling four bags with toys during thieving spree at 16 shops . Arrested: She's also banned from shops in Darwen (pictured) in Lancashire. She has scores of convictions and has been in and out of court since her first conviction in 2000 . Stealing: Shops in Clitheroe are also out of bounds for Caswell who admitted seven charges of theft this week . Last month when she appeared before Blackburn magistrates to admit seven charges of theft and ask for nine others to be considered. Her lawyer Andrew Church-Taylor said 'Through her addiction, she has lost her children, her dignity and her self-respect. 'She has, in effect, lost everything. When I spoke to her in the cells, she told me she hates what she is and wants to change.' Monday's ASBO hearing at the same court came as police recorded an increase in shoplifting in Blackburn and Darwen. They said that in the six months up to October 2012, there were 620 cases. The number rose to 659 during the same period this year. Officers said they were targeting other prolific shoplifters. After the case Inspector Abid Khan said: 'We are really pleased that this ASBO has been issued. It is unfair on the majority of the paying public that a minority targets these shops because they think they can get away with it. 'We are determined to do as much as we can to bring them to justice, and put conditions on them.'","Diane Caswell, 38, would go to towns to steal clothes, cosmetics and toys .

A former volunteer firefighter and his girlfriend charged in a string of arsons on the Eastern Shore has pleaded guilty to 68 counts. 40-year-old Charles Smith III pleaded guilty on Thursday in Accomack County Circuit Court to 67 counts of arson and one count of conspiracy to commit arson. He will be sentenced in December. Smith and his fiancée, Tonya Bundick, were accused of setting fire to abandoned structures between November 2012 and April of this year. They were arrested April 2. The string of intentionally set night-time blazes continued unabated for 142 days despite an influx of police investigators from around the state. Arrested: Charles R Smith III, 40, and his girlfriend Tonya S Bundick, 38, were arrested after they were found near of one of the fires they set . Devastation: This March 5 blaze was one of the 77 arsons that occurred in the rural Eastern Shore of Virginia from November to April . Bundick is charged with one count of arson and one count of conspiracy. In court documents, Smith told investigators he torched 52 unoccupied buildings, while Bundick set fire to 15 . Investigators have not been able to uncover why Smith . III, who went by the alias Charles Applegate when he served as captain . of the Tasley Volunteer Fire Department several years ago, and his . girlfriend, Tonya S. Bundick, decided to start the blazes. Plague: The 77 intentionally-set fires have struck houses up and down the length of the peninsula since November of last year . On Thursday, Smith's attorney made note of his client's bi-polar disorder, which was diagnosed after his arrest. Carl Bundick said this is the first time in his life that his client is being properly treated for the condition, reports WBOC. He also reportedly said Smith is 'extremely remorseful' for his actions. He faces a maximum of 584 years in prison and $5 million in fines and will be sentenced in December. Tyler granted defense attorney Carl Bundick’s request that Smith undergo additional psychological evaluation prior to his sentencing, which likely will take place in December. An earlier court-ordered evaluation found Smith was competent to stand trial, but concluded he was suffering from depression and was highly anxious. Because of the large number of charges, Virginia Commonwealth Attorney Gary Agar did not make an oral statement of facts about each charge but instead submitted a two-page joint stipulation of facts signed by both attorneys. The document was attached to a hefty summary report of Virginia State Police investigations of the fires — including addresses, property owners’ names, date of the fire and Smith’s statements about each one. Investigators raided Bundick's home during the search for evidence tying her to the arsons . Bundick and Smith lived in Parksley, a small community where the first of 77 deliberately set fires was lit. On March 14 Bundick wrote a message about the fires on her Facebook page. 'I have often wondered if arsonist is reading and laughs…I myself am not afraid just cautious…I am always on lookout when my animals start barking and when my livestock start making noise. Make (yourself) aware of the little things,' she said.","Charles Smith III was a volunteer firefighter but ended up setting them along with his fiancee .

Jack Hutton-Potts, 23, died in a climbing accident off the coast of Anglesey tethered to Vaughan Holme, the teacher who had introduced him to the sport . A boarding school teacher accidentally dragged a former student to his death in a climbing tragedy because they were tethered together. Vaughan Holme, 48, and Jack Hutton-Potts, 23, plunged more than 300ft to their deaths down a sea cliff. The pair had met at the prestigious Christ's Hospital School in Horsham, West Sussex, where father-of-two and housemaster Mr Holme had passed on his love of climbing. They continued meeting and were climbing The Gauntlet at Gogarth Cliffs, near Holyhead, Wales, when the double tragedy happened in June. An inquest heard Mr Holme, from Horsham, was probably leading the climb when he slipped and fell. The two men were tied together with a rope. The exact reason for his fall will never be clear, the coroner said. However, it appeared the two men had not yet hooked safety equipment which could have saved their lives into the rock face. Pathologist Dr Mark Lord said death for Mr Hutton-Potts, from Petersfield, Hampshire, was 'instantaneous' when he drowned after suffering a significant head injury. 'He’s fallen, become unconscious and unfortunately landed in the water and drowned,' the pathologist added. Mr Holme died of multiple injuries. The accident happened at Gogarth Cliffs near Holyhead, Wales. The town is on the isle of Anglesey, pictured . Coroner Nicola Jones said the impact of the plunge would have been devastating. 'What we have here are two men who were very competent climbers, both very safety aware and safety conscious,' she added. 'Clearly the only conclusion I can come to is the deaths were due to an accident. We don’t know why Vaughan fell. We don’t know why Jack decided not to hook on to the cliff.' The inquest heard the climb was challenging but well within the capabilities of both men. Elfyn Jones, of Llanberis mountain rescue team, said it appeared Mr Hutton-Potts was waiting to climb so there may have been a 'judgement call' about whether to use a belay, a climbing tool which would fix the rope to the rock. 'Had they been belayed it’s possible the fall wouldn’t . have had the consequences it had,' he added. Lifeboats and an RAF rescue helicopter took part in a major search after the pair were reported missing. Mr Jones abseiled down the cliff after the accident and spotted impact marks matching the colour of Mr Holme’s helmet. Teacher Catherine Butters, from . Liverpool, was taught to climb by Mr Holme and said he was 'very safe, very careful'. Christ's Hospital School was founded in the 16th Century and now sits on a 200-acre site. Although boarding fees are £28,000 a year, the school is rare in offering almost all its places for free or a reduced rate through a charitable scheme which funds 70% of pupils' fees. At the time of the accident, headmaster John Franklin said: 'Christ’s Hospital is a very close-knit community and the tragic loss of a popular teacher and a young Old Blue, who were both experienced climbers, has shocked and saddened staff, pupils and the Old Blue community.'","Student Jack Hutton-Potts, 23, was tethered to teacher Vaughan Holme, 48 .

The charity that protects the UK's historic and natural spaces has revealed it could allow fracking on its land. The head of the National Trust says that the controversial method which drills for natural gas could be given the go-ahead on conserved land. Dame Helen Ghosh also practically ruled out allowing wind farms on the conservation charity's property. In August, the charity said on its website that is has 'a presumption against fracking on National Trust land' because natural gas is a fossil gas . She told The Times: 'I think it is unlikely we would ever promote or allow a wind farm on our land.' She also said the charity was concerned about proposals for offshore wind farms which could be visible from its land in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The Trust's director general said that the charity is studying the environmental impact that fracking has on the earth. She told The Times: 'We all have yet to see what the surface environmental impact of fracking is and when we have seen it then we would reach a view about whether (we would object to it) adjacent to National Trust land or on National Trust land.' This is an about-turn for the charity, which in August said on its website that is has 'a presumption against fracking on National Trust land' because natural gas is a fossil gas. Dame Helen Ghosh also practically ruled out allowing wind farms on the conservation charity's property . It argued that the purpose of fracking - to mine for a finite resource which produces damaging greenhouse gases in the way it is burned - clashes with the charity's approach to energy use. The Trust also argued that the mining process gives rise to potential environmental and landscape impacts. In August, the charity outlined its unfavourable view of fracking, saying: 'Fossil gas is a finite resource that can only be mined and not harvested – it is not renewable. 'Its combustion produces greenhouse gases which we believe contribute to climate change. 'Climate change has a significant adverse impact on our core purpose of looking after special places, for ever for everyone. 'A presumption against extracting and increasing the supply of natural gas from our own properties is . The Dame said it is unlikely that the Trust would allow a wind farm on its land . consistent with our approach to our own energy use and generation. 'This is firstly to reduce our consumption of it at National Trust directly managed properties, and then to generate as much renewable energy as we reasonably can in a way that respects the landscape and environment.' The Trust was founded in 1895 by Victorians, including Octavia Hill, who were determined to protect the countryside and places of historical importance. Since then it has fought to protect the countryside, and has committed itself to a programme revolving around reducing its environmental footprint. It has pledged to reduce use of fossil fuels by 50 per cent within the next 10 years. It aims to cut its carbon emissions from energy use for heat and electricity by 45 per cent – attempting to beat the Government's target of a 34 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020. Dame Helen's comments came after the Prime Minister announced a review of competition within the energy market yesterday and signalled he wanted to 'get to grips' with green regulations which were driving up energy bills. Downing Street said the proposal had been discussed over the course of weeks with Liberal Democrat ministers and would be set out in detail in Chancellor George Osborne's Autumn Statement on December 4. Mr Cameron insisted last night he had raised the ideas with his coalition partners and he was still committed to the environment. He said: 'Yes we should also look at rolling back the cost of some of these taxes, tariffs, charges that have been put in place. 'They are responsible for around £112 of someone's bill today and if we are serious about getting energy prices down and helping families it's no good having some phoney freeze policy, as Labour do, which is something of a con, what you need is to actually look at what is causing bills to go up. 'So that is what we are doing, it is something we have discussed in the coalition over the last few weeks.' Officials announced that the annual review of competition in the energy sector will be conducted by regulator Ofgem, the Office of Fair Trading and the new Competition and Markets Authority.

A Christian bakery that refused to make a lesbian couple a tiered wedding cake because it would violate their 'religious beliefs' has shut down after months of hate-mail and plummeting revenues. Melissa and Aaron Klein have been driven out of their shop in Gresham, Oregon - and are taking operations back into their home - after they say they received death- and also rape-threats and saw client numbers fall following their decision not to serve a lesbian couple. Media reports say they have been hounded by hate mail since January when Rachel Cryer and Laurel Bowman were refused service and subsequently made a discrimination complaint to authorities about the bakery. Driven out: Bakery owners Aaron and Melissa Klein have closed their Gresham, Ore. bakery after being hounded by hate mail for refusing to serve a same-sex couple because they believe it would have violated their Christian values . The bakery owners said they would rather close than undermine their beliefs and they will continue operations from their home . On . Friday the bakers posted on their Facebook page: 'This will be our last . weekend at the shop we are moving our business to an in home bakery.' According to The Blaze, . which saw some of the hate mail received by the bakers, one read: 'You . stupid bible-thumping, hypocritical b**ch.  I hope your kids get really, . really, sick and you go out of business,' and another said: 'Here’s . hoping you go out of business, you bigot. Enjoy hell.' The . couple told the news service their customers had been 'badgered and . harassed' not to do business with the bakery and subsequently, orders . for wedding cakes this summer were significantly lower than usual. Some clients even cancelled existing orders because of the public debacle, the Blaze said.

Lavinia Sealy, chairman of Surrey County Council, said she was 'fundamentally opposed' to same-sex marriage and predicted it would have negative consequences for 'families and children' Tory traditionalists in the Cabinet are preparing to back gay marriage despite continuing anger among the party’s grassroots. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, one of the Government’s most senior Right-wingers, indicated yesterday he will vote in favour of legalising same-sex unions next week, while Baroness Warsi, who has previously expressed concern, also revealed she is to back the reform. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, the standard bearer for the Tory Right, is expected to abstain rather than vote against, and may even back the legislation, according to friends. Some other Cabinet critics are expected to contrive to miss a Commons debate on gay marriage rather than vote against. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is the most implacably opposed member of the Cabinet, according to Number Ten sources. Whips expect around 60 per cent of Conservative MPs to vote in favour of gay marriage, and around 40 per cent – 120 MPs – oppose it in a free vote. In an indication of the ongoing anger in Tory ranks at the reform, which has been championed by David Cameron, one Conservative council chairman launched a strong attack on the party leadership. Lavinia Sealy, chairman of Surrey County Council, said she was ‘fundamentally opposed’ to same-sex marriage and predicted it would have negative consequences for ‘families and children’. Mrs Sealy told Paul Deach from the Surrey Heath Residents Network there were ‘lots of gays in the media’, which meant that ‘if anybody speaks out, you’re rubbished’. In an interview recorded at an event staffed by the Coalition for Marriage, which is campaigning against the Government’s plans, she added: ‘It is not a question of religion, it is a question of our natural beings. ‘It’s a question of being educated about our whole humanity, the history of humanity. Playing around with that just from the point of view of an equalisation doesn’t make sense for families and for children.’ Mrs Sealy said she was ‘disappointed’ with Education Secretary Michael Gove, who represents a Surrey seat, for pushing the equal marriage legislation. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, left, and Baroness Warsi, right, will vote in favour of legalising same-sex marriages next week . ‘Why the hell should they [pro-gay marriage Conservatives] make up their minds about something? We have been in a particular party for longer than they have, probably before they were born... ‘They’re kids on the block in some ways and it annoys me that they can be so clever about it without talking to everybody. It’s a bit Orwellian. Do we have the right to speak out anymore in this country without being dissed by anybody, without being sneered at by the BBC? There are lots of gays in the media that if anybody speaks out, you’re rubbished.’ The councillor added: ‘I am, by the way, absolutely in favour of equal treatment for gays, both lesbians and gays, and the civil partnership.’ Lady Warsi, who is minister for faith, confirmed she planned to vote in favour of plans to legalise gay marriage as long as churches and other faith groups are properly protected. A spokesman for Mr Grayling, who caused controversy in the last election campaign when he spoke in favour of bed and breakfast owners who wanted to be able to turn away homosexual guests, said he would also vote in favour.","Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Baroness Warsi will vote in favour .

The horse fell to the ground late afternoon on Sunday on 59th Street and Central Park South. The area was filled with tourists at the time, who looked shocked as the horse lay motionless. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Exhausted: The horse colllapsed on 59th Street and Central Park South on Sunday . Eye witness Mary Xanthos told MailOnline: 'I saw the horse laying on its left side for a few minutes. 'Then about six people managed to get the horse back on his feet, which also took a minute or two. 'The horse was apparently taken back to the stable. 'I just hope he'll receive a proper veterinary exam.' Distressed: The carriage horse fell after a long day of ferrying tourists around Central Park . Another horse fell in Manhattan in early November, reigniting tensions over the horse-drawn-carriage industry. The debate had flared two weeks earlier when a horse died, and was said to be in terrible pain. The accuracy of that was called into question when the same vet changed her statement days later, saying that animal rights groups pressured her to hint the animal was abused. Though representatives from the Horse and Carriage industry say that the most recent incident was not caused by illness or neglect and was simply an accident, many animal rights activists are calling for the complete end of the historic industry that caters to tourists. Tumble: A horse fell after tripping on the carriage mechanism in early November, making it the second carriage related accident in two weeks . Traffic: The accident was on Broadway near Columbus Circle by Central Park, right in the heart of the evening traffic . The horse that tumbled Friday in Columbus . Circle, on the south west side of Central Park, is still alive after . his hind leg got caught in the carriage shaft, causing him to hit the . ground. 'Yet again it's another illustration of why these horses do not belong on the streets of New York City,' said Carly Knudson. Friday night's incident comes just two weeks after another horse, named Charlie, collapsed and died on his way to Central Park on October 23. The American Society for the . Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) paid for Charlie's initial . autopsy, and released a statement saying that the horse suffered from a . stomach ulcer and a fractured tooth. Tragic: The New York carriage horse collapsed and died in the street as it made the early morning commute from its stables to Central Park to begin its shift . Outrage: Campaigners argue that the number of collisions and the suffering of the animals make the cost of the industry too high . Dr Pamela Corey, speaking on behalf of . the ASPCA, then released a statement saying that that they were 'very . concerned that Charlie was forced to work in spite of painful maladies'. Ms Corey has since been fired from her . job because she later released a correction, lessening the severity of . the ASPCA's first statement, creating another drama amid the debate. Dead: The horse that died in New York on October 23 is covered with a tarpaulin before being loaded into a police vehicle . In her correction, Ms Corey tried to . clarify that any statements saying that it was false to interpret that . Charlie was abused. She said instead that the ulcers were common among . working horses, and that there was no way to know if the animal was . feeling any pain. Native: Lea Michele grew up in New York and said that putting an end to hansom cabs was the first issue she wanted to work on with PETA . 'I was under a lot of pressure during . the writing of that press release and that the mistake and the need for . the correction is the result for that pressure,' Ms Corey said in her . second statement. She was promptly suspended without pay. After Charlie's death, a representative . from the Horse and Carriage Association of New York said: 'It's not . something that happens regularly - our horses are taken care of.' The continuation of horse drawn . carriage has been a point of contention with animal activists for years, . though the debate truly picked up steam this year as four horses have . fallen since late July. Singer Pink and actresses Pamela . Anderson and Lea Michele have worked with the group People for the . Ethical Treatment of Animals for years and both issued statements . condemning the practice. Ms Michele, a native New Yorker, wrote an open . letter to Mayor Michael Bloomberg after the death of Charlie, calling . hansom cabs dangerous. Attention-grabber: Actress Pamela Anderson has been a longtime supporter of PETA and has posed for many of their campaigns . Mr Bloomberg has long been a supporter of the industry, saying it promotes tourism and helps the horses. 'Most of them wouldn’t have been alive if they didn’t have a job,' the Mayor said of the horses. As an alternative, there is a city . council bill that would replace the horse drawn carriages with . vintage-replica electric cars. The thought is that the cars would still . provide the economic tourism boom typically earned by the horses and be . safer for the city's residents- both human and animal.

The TSA agent who was shot dead by an authority-hating gunman at LAX on Friday once laughed and joked with Kris Jenner as he helped her through security at the busy airport. A December 2012 video, which emerged today, shows a friendly 39-year-old Gerardo Hernandez chatting away to Jenner as he checks her documents and those of her companions. Jenner, wearing a fur coat, chats back for about 30 seconds before moving through the security checkpoint and on to the screening area of the airport. Scroll down for video . Friendly: A December 2012 video, which emerged today, shows 39-year-old Gerardo Hernandez, right, chatting with Kris Jenner, pictured in grey coat, as he checks her documents and those of her companions at LAX . The video footage comes after it was revealed the LAX shooter was so bent on killing Hernandez that he returned to the TSA agent to finish the job after seeing him move. Authorities said this weekend that Ciancia first walked up an escalator and away from the 39-year-old after riddling him with holes. But when the shooter noticed the TSA agent move, he returned to see his mission through. As first-degree murder charges were filed against Ciancia, it was revealed that the 23-year-old had hoped the attack would 'instill fear in their traitorous minds.' In a news conference announcing charges against Ciancia, U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr spelled out a chilling chain of events inside LAX that began when Ciancia strode into Terminal 3 on Friday, pulled a Smith & Wesson .223-caliber assault rifle out of his duffel bag and fired repeatedly at point-blank range at Hernandez before the main screening area. After killing the officer, Ciancia fired on at least two other uniformed TSA employees and an airline passenger, who were all wounded. Airport police eventually shot him as panicked passengers cowered in stores and restaurants. Coincidence: Kris Jenner, with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, met Hernandez at LAX in December 2012, around the time the couple announced their pregnancy . Victim: Gerardo I. Hernandez, left, was shot and killed by a gunman at the Los Angeles International Airport on Friday. He was caught on video helping Kris Jenner, right, through airport security a year ago . Family: Hernandez, seen in the center with a mustache, was the father of two children and is married . Tributes started to flow in for the . hard-working airport staffer immediately after Hernandez was identified . as the victim, with friends and family describing him as a loving . husband and caring father who enjoyed spending his free time with his . two children. Hernanez's . cousin told friends on Facebook that he was destroyed by his death. Meanwhile, a different family friend told MailOnline she had known . Hernandez's wife for years. The woman said Hernandez had worked at Los . Angeles International Airport for three years before his death on . Friday. The Wrap has identified the victim's wife as Ana Machuca Hernandez, a marketing budget manager for Warner Brothers. 'It's devastating because he was such a great guy. All he talked about was his family,' Hernandez's friend Kevin Maxwell told NBC Los Angeles. Maxwell said Hernandez was 'very proud' of his son and 'spoke profoundly' of his daughter. A doctor at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center told NBC News that Hernandez was one of two shooting victims who were taken to the hospital, but there was no chance of his survival. A round of shots broke into fragments inside his torso and caused chest injuries while setting off debilitating internal bleeding. Targeted: Paul Ciancia, pictured, said in a note that he wanted to kill multiple TSA workers and show how easy it is to get a gun in an airport . Securing the scene: Police found a note near Ciancia's bag at the airport where he wrote about his anti-government leanings and signed it with a reference to a well-known conspiracy theory . 'We made every effort to stop the bleeding and get the heart to beat on his own,' Dr David Plurad told the news station. He was the first TSA agent ever to be killed at an airport while working for the government. 'No . words can explain the horror that we experienced today when a shooter . took the life of a member of our family and injured two TSA officers at . Los Angeles International Airport,' TSA administrator John Pistole wrote . in a letter. 'Sadly, . today marks the first incident where a TSA officer was killed in the . line of duty. We can take some comfort knowing that the two injured . officers are recovering from their wounds.' City . officials have ordered several tributes be paid to Hernandez across Los . Angeles, as flags at all government-owned buildings in the area were be . flown at half mast. LAPD officers also wore black bands on their police badges in his honor. Ciancia is accused of walking into Los Angeles . International airport on Friday morning and calmly removed a . semi-automatic weapon from his duffel bag before opening fire at the . security checkpoint where TSA agents examined traveler's passports. He is believed to have targeted TSA . agents specifically, using their bright blue uniforms as a way to . distinguish them from the traveling masses. Heartbroken: Ana Hernandez, whose husband Gerado was killed in the attack, said he loved his job with the TSA . Targets: Multiple witnesses recounted how he asked them if they worked for TSA, and when they said they did not he just continued walking. (This is not believed to be Hernandez, but another victim) When . that was not enough to help him decide whether or not to shoot, Ciancia . asked individuals if they were members of the Transportation Security . Administration. Traveler Leon Saryan who spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper about how he feels the gunman was clearly targeting TSA agents. 'I . was just getting ready to pick up my shoes and belt and pick up my . other stuff... (when) people hit the ground and then started to run,' Mr . Saryan told CNN. He said while he was going to get his shoes that were waiting on the conveyer belt, a uniformed TSA agent 'grabbed the shoes and the two of us started running down the corridor towards the gate. This agent got hit... it seemed to be a grazing wound.' At that point the agent kept running and seemed fine because the bullet hit him in the shoulder as Mr Saryan huddled in the corner, right when the gunman came up to him. '(Suspect Paul Ciancia) looked at me and said ""TSA?"" I just shook my head and he kept going,' Mr Saryan told Anderson Cooper. 'It was kind of hard to see his expression. I was more focused on the weapon.

Beneath the waters of the Indian Ocean, by the idyllic islands of Reunion and Mauritius, there lies traces of an ancient, hidden continent, new research claims. The continent fragment known as Mauritia detached about 60million years ago while Madagascar and India drifted apart, researchers say, and had lain concealed beneath huge masses of lava. And it appears such micro-continents hidden beneath the oceans occur more frequently than previously thought, says a study in the latest issue of Nature Geoscience. Paradise beach: An international team of researchers deduced the existence of a lost continent beneath the waters of the Indian Ocean through a study of grains of sand taken from the beaches of Mauritius . Mauritia was a strip of land which was once tucked between India and Madagascar - two landmasses now separated by thousands of miles of deep ocean, but which were then next door to each other. An international team of researchers deduced its existence through a study of grains of sand taken from the beaches of Mauritius. The grains were dated back to a volcanic eruption which took place about nine million years ago, but analysis showed they contained minerals that were much older. Professor Trond Torsvik, from the University of Oslo, Norway, told the BBC: 'We found zircons that we extracted from the beach sands, and these are something you typically find in a continental crust. They are very old in age.' The break-up of continents is often associated with geological phenomena known as mantle plumes. These are giant bubbles of hot rock which rise from deep within our planet and soften tectonic plates from below, until the plates break apart at the hotspots. This is how Eastern Gondwana broke apart about 170million years ago. At first, one part was separated, which in turn fragmented into Madagascar, India, Australia and Antarctica, which then migrated to their present position. Plumes currently sitting beneath the islands Maritius and Reunion appear to have played a role in the emergence of the Indian Ocean. If the zone of the rupture lies at the edge of a land mass (in this case Madagascar and India), fragments of this land mass may be separated off. The Seychelles are a well-known example of such a continental fragment. The coloured track (left colour scale) west of Reunion is the calculated movement of the Reunion hotspot. The black lines with yellow circles and the red circle indicate the corresponding calculated track on the African plate and the Indian plate, respectively. The numbers in the circles are ages in millions of years. The areas with topography just below the sea surface are now regarded as continental fragments . An underwater 'Grand Canyon' has been captured in a series of spectacular images created by a Royal Navy survey ship. HMS Enterprise discovered the 250 metre-deep canyon in the Red Sea during a nine-month mission to improve understanding of the waters east of Suez. The 3D images were created after the ship left the Egyptian port of Safaga and were made using the Devonport-based survey ship's multibeam echo sounder. Commander Derek Rae, commanding officer of HMS Enterprise, said: 'These features could be the result of ancient rivers scouring through the rock strata before the Red Sea flooded millennia ago.' A group of geoscientists from Norway, South Africa, Britain and Germany have now published research that suggests, based on the study of lava sand grains from the beach of Mauritius, the existence of further fragments. The sand grains contain semi-precious zircons aged between 660 and 1,970million years, which is explained by the fact that the zircons were carried by the lava as it pushed through subjacent continental crust of this age. This dating method was supplemented by a recalculation of plate tectonics, which explains exactly how and where the fragments ended up in the Indian Ocean. Dr Bernhard Steinberger of the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences and Dr Pavel Doubrovine of Oslo University calculated the hotspot trail. 'On the one hand, it shows the position of the plates relative to the two hotspots at the time of the rupture, which points towards a causal relation,' said Dr Steinberger. 'On the other hand, we were able to show that the continent fragments continued to wander almost exactly over the Reunion plume, which explains how they were covered by volcanic rock.' So what was previously interpreted only as the trail of the Reunion hotspot, are continental fragments which were previously not recognised as such because they were covered by the volcanic rocks of the Reunion plume. It therefore appears that such micro-continents in the ocean occur more frequently than previously thought.","Continental fragment known as Mauritia once linked Madagascar and India .

A shop owner who makes a living shopping at Trader Joe's in the U.S. and reselling the goods for a profit in his Canadian store has won a legal battle against the retail giant. Pirate Joe's owner Michael Hallatt said he felt 'vindicated' after a judge ruled his Vancouver outlet did not damage the Trader Joe's brand. Trader Joe's slapped Hallatt with a lawsuit in May alleging trademark infringement and false advertising, and arguing the 600-square-foot retailer was hurting its reputation. Victor: Michael Hallatt, who makes a living buying Trader Joe's products in the U.S. and selling them in his Canadian shop, has won a legal fight against the retailer . Fearless: After his court victory, Hallatt changed the chalkboard sign at the front of his shop from 'Unauthorized, Unaffiliated, Unafraid' to 'We won!' But U.S. district Judge Marsha Pechman dismissed the federal suit, ruling there was no basis to apply a U.S. law known as the Lanham Act, which confers upon U.S. courts broad jurisdictional powers. CBC News reported Pechman said all the alleged infringements take place in Canada, and Trader Joe's cannot show economic harm. Hallatt, 53, said Wednesday's ruling was appropriate because he pays full-price for Trader Joe's products. He changed a catchphrase on a chalkboard outside his shop from 'Unauthorized. Unaffiliated. Unafraid' to 'We Won!' 'The Lanham Act, which is this very broad powerful statute that allows corporations to, kind of, you know, beat up on anybody that affects U.S. commerce is very, very strong and powerful and can essentially shut down commerce in another country,' he said. 'It really had to be black and white that we were not affecting U.S. commerce at all. And so for us to have it dismissed, it really had to be black and white that we were not affecting U.S. commerce at all.' Business continuity: Hallatt will be allowed to continue selling Trader Joe's goods at his Pirate Joe's shop . Passionate: Hallatt opened his store last year and said his customers love it . NBC News reported . Trader Joe's has the option to file a claim under state law against . Hallatt within 10 days. The company hasn't said if it will pursue . further legal action. 'We . sell our products in our stores to our customers; and to maintain the . goodwill and integrity of the Trader Joe’s brand, it is extremely . important to us to protect and preserve the customer experience we have . developed in our stores over the past 46 years,' Trader Joe's said in a . statement on Thursday. 'While . we are disappointed and disagree with the Court’s determination that it . could not exercise jurisdiction over the defendant’s activities in . Canada, we will continue to do everything in our power to protect our . trademarks and the integrity of our products for our customers.' Hallatt has spent more than $350,000 buying food at the . popular U.S. grocery chain since opening his store last year. He fills his panel van with up to $5000 of shopping each week . then drives it all back to his shop. 'I'm their best customer,' Hallatt told Sfgate.com.'Almost all the stores in the Pacific Northwest have asked me to leave.' Time to respond: Trader Joe's has 10 days to appeal the ruling which allows Pirate Joe's to continue selling their products in Canada .

A study found that mothers-to-be who snore at least three nights a week are also more likely to need a Caesarean section than those who sleep soundly. The researchers said treating mothers’ sleep problems could help babies and cut care costs. Mothers-to-be who snore are more likely to give birth to a small baby, a study has found . Previous research has already shown . that women who start to snore during pregnancy are at risk of developing . high blood pressure and the potentially dangerous pregnancy condition . pre-eclampsia. More than a third of the 1,673 pregnant women recruited for the new U.S. study reported habitual snoring. Scientists found that women who snored in their sleep three or more nights per week had a higher risk of poor delivery outcomes, including smaller babies and Caesarean births. Chronic snorers, who snored both before and during pregnancy, were two thirds more likely to have a baby whose weight was in the bottom 10 per cent. They were also more than twice as likely to need a Caesarean delivery. Dr Louise O’Brien, from the University of Michigan’s Sleep Disorders Centre, said: ‘There has been great interest in the implications of snoring during pregnancy and how it affects maternal health but there is little data on how it may impact the health of the baby. Snoring during pregnancy is also linked to higher rates of Caesarean delivery . ‘We’ve found that chronic snoring is associated with both smaller babies and C-sections, even after we accounted for other risk factors. ‘This suggests that we have a window of opportunity to screen pregnant women for breathing problems during sleep that may put them at risk of poor delivery outcomes.’ Snoring is a key sign of obstructive sleep apnoea, which results in the airway becoming partially blocked, said the researchers, whose findings appear in the journal Sleep. This can reduce blood oxygen levels during the night and is associated with serious health problems, including high blood pressure and heart attacks. Sleep apnoea can be treated with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), which involves wearing a machine during sleep to keep the airways open. Dr O’Brien added: ‘If we can identify risks during pregnancy that can be treated, such as obstructive sleep apnoea, we can reduce the incidence of small babies, C-sections and possibly NICU (neo-natal intensive care unit) admission that not only improve long-term health benefits for newborns but also help keep costs down.’","Snoring during pregnancy is also linked to higher rates of Caesareans .

Six vehicles, including the truck and trailer, were destroyed by the impact. Espinoza originally told police he he didn't see the police cars because he was looking in his mirror at a passing truck. He also said he never uses his phone while driving because it is against company policy. Obscured: At the start of the video, Espinoza has his face obscured by a wallet.

Frightening: He desperately tries to hang on to the wheel and wrestle the truck back under control as it smashes into another emergency vehicle . However, when police examined his phone they discovered he had been using the internet at the time of the crash. He was on Facebook looking at 'photographs of several women in provocative positions, wearing little clothing', 'photographs of a woman in a low cut dress', and photos of a man 'smoking something', according to police reports. Espinoza had also used his phone to look at YouTube, female escort web pages, porn sites and social networks on other occasions when he was logged in as driving, investigators said. Emergency services were in the area dealing with an earlier crash and tending to people with injuries.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:40 EST, 6 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:55 EST, 6 November 2013 . Democrats in New Jersey outnumber Republicans by 700,000. But Chris Christie, the state's swaggering GOP governor, won re-election easily on Tuesday night in what was certainly a preview of his presidential aspirations. 'I know that if we can do this in Trenton, New Jersey,' Christie told supporters after his landslide victory, 'then maybe the folks in Washington, D.C., should tune in their TVs right now and see how it’s done.' Christie, a political moderate in every way, prevailed by a wide margin in a year when establishment Republicans have been steamrolled in public by tea party partisans. His success came via voting blocs that have traditionally been in Democrats' corner, giving GOP insiders hope that President Barack Obama's two victories might be historical anomalies rather than trends in the making. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Two terms: Christie hasn't pledged to serve out his second term as New Jersey's governor, leaving the door open for a 2016 presidential run . Studying up for the electoral college: Chris Christie is perfectly positioned to enter the presidential race as a moderate who can appeal to both Republicans and Democrats . Everybody loves you now: Christie won a landslide victory over Democrat Barbara Buono, cementing his bipartisan appeal and making him a virtual shoo-in for presidential favorite status in the GOP . 'We’ll be led back by our governors, and Chris Christie is now at the forefront of that resurgence,' former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie told The New York Times on Wednesday. 'He’s proved that a conservative Republican can get votes from Hispanics and African-Americans, that a pro-life governor can get votes from women. This means that those voters are available to us, that we’re not shut out demographically or geographically – that it’s worth the effort.' The larger-than-life Christie already casts a nation-sized shadow, but his national profile is set to grow even bigger this month when he takes over the leadership of the Republican Governors Association. That position affords him some control over which state-level candidates the party's machine will endorse and financially support state candidates the party will support – giving him key leverage in advance of the 2016 presidential cycle. And in order to store up favors, Christie is hitting the road. Man of the hour: Christie is poised to raise his profile even more as he takes over leadership of the Republican Governors Association while running New Jersey and entering the 2016 presidential fray . Born in the USA: The Bruce Springsteen-loving governor cast his ballot on Tuesday amid speculation that his world-beating poll numbers, his no-nonsense style and his universal appeal would make him a White House shoo-in . Larger than life but smaller than before: Christie's hirsute form has shrunk in the last eight months following lap-band surgery to control his weight. Shedding pounds will also make him a more appealing White House hopeful . Christie said Wednesday that he would be popping into 'places like Ohio and Michigan and Florida,' states with both contentious gubernatorial races and key electoral votes for the next presidential victor. Observers expect Christie to support moderate candidates at the expense of tea party stalwarts. A GOP strategist told MailOnline on Wednesday that the tea party surge still has momentum at the state level, but 'the future of presidential politics belongs to the party's centrists.' 'Reading the tea leaves,' he said, 'it seems that 2016 is Christie's for the taking, and that's good news for Republicans. Tea party be damned, the next GOP presidential primary season will be the anti-2012. And Christie's not going to be a milquetoast-y centrist like Mitt Romney. He's as bold as Ted Cruz but as universally appealing as Bill Clinton.' 'This is a guy who has shown that a moderate in a blue state can sweep aside left-wing opponents by the sheer force of his personality. If we could just clone him a dozen times, we'd keep the White House until the second coming.'","Christie will hit the road as the new chief of the Republican Governors Association, visiting states that will play big roles in 2016 .

A Massachusetts state trooper who was assigned to desk duties after he leaked grisly arrest photos of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev has retired from the force. Tactical photographer Sgt. Sean Murphy 'was absolutely not forced out,' his lawyer, Leonard Kesten, said on Tuesday, adding that the trooper would receive a full pension. '(He is) happy with state police. It was just time.' The decision came days after internal charges were upheld against Murphy, a 25-year-veteran with the state police. Those charges included unauthorized dissemination of information, insubordination, unsatisfactory performance and violation of departmental rules and regulation. Retirement: Sgt.

State police spokesman David Procopio declined to describe the penalties Murphy faced, citing privacy laws governing employee records.

The graphic images showed a battered, bloody then-19-year-old as he emerged from a boat he'd been cowering in with hands raised the night he was captured by authorities. Murphy said he was so enraged by the August cover of music magazine Rolling Stone, which depicted the suspect as a rock star that he handed the grisly images to Boston Magazine. He argued Rolling Stone had glamorized terrorism by running the picture of Tsarnaev looking like a hippy. Murphy argued his images showed the true face of terrorism, but he was reprimanded for releasing them without authorization. Angry: Sgt Sean Murphy said he was so incensed by what he saw as the glamorisation of Tsarnaev by Rolling Stone magazine, that he released these photos .

Murphy was first suspended and then assigned to desk duty before being transferred from the state police barracks in Framingham to Athol. However, he never actually worked out of the Athol barracks because he was on leave for an injury sustained off the job. At the time the photos were released, Murphy wrote in a posting on the Boston Magazine website: 'I hope that the people who see these images will know that this was real. It was as real as it gets. This may have played out as a television show, but this was not a television show.' Victims and their families jumped to .

Survivor: Elizabeth Smart has published a book about her nine-month abduction ordeal and gives frequent lectures on her story (seen here on October 8) Elizabeth Smart has spoken out about the three women who were kidnapped and held captive in a Cleveland home for a decade, saying she admires their strength. 'I'm always more than happy to speak to survivors... (but) I know how precious privacy is,' she said at an event in Bowling Green State University. 'I admire them so much. They are so strong.' Smart's latest public speech came at an event in northwest Ohio on Tuesday at Bowling Green State University. When asked about her marriage to Matthew Gilmour, The Courier reports that she told the crowd: 'It's great. I'm good, I'm happy.' She spoke about how she survived nine months of captivity after being abducted in Utah when she was just 14. The three young women who were found in Ariel Castro's Cleveland home were just a few years older than Smart was when she was abducted. The difference between the two cases was the length at which they were held as Michelle Knight was held for 11 years, Amanda Berry for 10 and Gina DeJesus for nine. The young women have followed Smart's lead but at a quicker pace. The Mormon harpist from Utah took more than a decade to release a book, shunning the media for years as she and her family tried to get back to their normal way of life before speaking about the ordeal. Michelle Knight has already given a sit-down interview to Dr Phil that will be aired in the coming days. Berry and DeJesus have made a deal with a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist to write a book about their experience. Last month, Smart released a book about her kidnapping and has been speaking in great detail about the harrowing experience and her handful of close-call rescues. Working together: Amanda Berry (left) and Gina DeJesus (right) have paired up with an award-winning journalist to help them pen a book about their time in Ariel Castro's captivity . Opening up: Michelle Knight has filmed a sit-down interview with Dr Phil . During an hour-long interview with Meredith Vieira that aired last month, Smart returned to the remote spot where she had been chained up between trees and raped every day as a teenager. She told of how in spite of the fear and confusion she felt immediately after captor Brian David Mitchell took her from her home in the middle of the night, she used information she knew about other kidnappings in the vain hope of trying have her parents get closure. As they trekked up a remote path in the woods, she tried rationalizing with Mitchell: 'If you're going to rape and kill me, will you please just do it here so that my parents can find my body?' 'He just smiled at me and said ""I'm not going to kill you yet,""' she told Vieira. When they stopped their trek, they arrived at a campsite where his accomplice- his wife, Wanda Barzee- was waiting. She began performing a makeshift wedding ceremony and Elizabeth said that she stopped crying and began to understand what was going on towards the end. 'I was begging and crying and just so scared,’ she told Vieira. 'I knew what happened after a wedding. Again, she tried to argue her way out of trouble: 'Wait I didn't say I do. I didn't say yes. I'm just a little girl, you know I'm so little I haven't even hit puberty yet,' Smart recalls saying at the time. 'He raped me right there on the floor of the tent and then when he was finished I was left alone feeling absolutely broken absolutely shattered. I was broken beyond repair,' she said. 'Everytime I thought ""OK this cannot get worse,"" it always did.' 'There was a point that I stopped crying,' she revealed. 'It’s not just . because I didn’t feel pain any more, not because I didn’t feel sorrow. It was just to keep going. I mean, it just was to survive, to live.' 'Sleep was like my oasis- the place I could go to. If I could’ve slept for nine months, I would have. Moving on: Smart's book comes nearly a decade after her kidnapping . Behind bars: Smart testified to the competency of her captor, Brian David Mitchell (left) and he was sentenced to life in prison while his wife Wanda Ileen Barzee (right) will spend 15 years behind bars . Unimaginable: Smart said how she was repeatedly raped and tied to a tree, being treated as less than human . Perspective: Smart says that revisiting the site doesn't bother her because it wasn't the area that caused her harm, it was her captors who are now behind bars . Smart, who is promoting the book that . she wrote about her ordeal, told Vieira about the numerous close calls . she had to being rescued over the course of her nine months of . captivity. One came . when she heard her uncle's voice calling out her name as he participated . in one of the many search parties who explored the woods looking for . the kidnapped girl. Like . so many other instances, Smart wanted to scream out but faced a very . real threat from Mitchell: 'If they ever get into this camp, I will kill . them,' he said. The trio moved to California briefly before heading back to Utah where they stopped in a local Walmart. It was there that . she saw a wall of missing persons posters but did not see her own, . making her think 'did they forget me? Did they give up on me?' They . hadn't: someone in the store called police and said that she thought . she saw the man whose picture she had seen on the news in connection to . the Elizabeth Smart disappearance. New beginnings: Smart married fellow Mormon Matthew Gilmour and he had never heard of her case until she told him all of the details herself . Happy now: Smart had her husband Matthew Gilmour alongside her for portions of the interview with Vieira . The . officer asked Elizabeth who she was when he arrived at the store, but, . like the time in the library, she was too afraid to answer. 'I was scared- what if the policeman didn't believe me? What if they released me back to Mitchell and Barzee?' she said. Rather . than leave, however, the officer took all three into the police station . and it was only when Smart's father Ed came into the interrogation room . with Elizabeth did she know that everything was going to be alright. 'I . was so happy when I saw him and he came running over and grabbed me in . his arms. I knew that nobody would be able to hurt me ever again,' she . said.

'Sent angry texts': Simon Gittany arrives at court with his new girlfriend during his trial for the murder of his fiancee Lisa Harnum . The man accused of throwing his ballerina fiancée to her death from their high-rise apartment in Sydney sent her text messages pleading with her not to look at other men, a court heard today. 'Please don’t let any guy talk to you or please don’t look at any guy as your eyes should gaze on me, the one,’ said one of texts read out in the New South Wales Supreme Court where 40-year-old Simon Gittany has denied murdering 30-year-old Lisa Harnum. Asked by a prosecutor to comment on the text, Gittany said: ‘I was being cute.’ The court heard of a second text to Canadian Miss Harnum in which he wrote: ‘Who the f*** do you think you are walking around the house like you own it or coming and going without my permission? ‘You walk around like a peacock with your hair out.’ Gittany told prosecutor Mark Tedeschi that he and Miss Harnum had been arguing for two days at the time the text was sent. ‘I was angry and I shouldn’t have sent that message,’ he said. The texts were revealed to the court after Gittany had demonstrated how he tried to save his fiancée from plunging to her death from the balcony of their 15th floor luxury apartment. Holding both arms outstretched, with his palms down, he said one of his legs was resting on the handle grip of a treadmill as he tried to reach Miss Harnum who was on the awning of the unit - a wooden structure protruding from the actual balcony. Mr Tedeschi asked Gittany if he had used his ‘superior strength as a male to commit a serious act of aggression’ when he dragged Miss Harnum back into their unit on the morning. ‘Yes, I agree,’ Gittany replied, but added that he had not intended to be aggressive.

The prosecutor asked what had happened in the 69 seconds between Miss Harnum being pulled back into unit 1503 and the time she fell to her death on that morning of July 30, 2011. ‘I suggest that you threw her off the balcony while she was still wearing the handbag she had been wearing in the hall (at the time she tried to leave).’ ‘No,’ Gittany said. '69 seconds after you committed this act of aggression, Lisa Harnum was dead,’ said Mr Tedeschi. ‘Yes.’ ‘Did you threaten her with death prior to her running out of the apartment?’ ‘No.’ The prosecutor asked Gittany if he was ‘apoplectic’ when he found out Miss Harnum was leaving him and that she had given clothes to her personal trainer, Lisa Brown. Struggle: The prosecutor asked Gittany if he had used his 'superior strength as a male to commit a serious act of aggression' when he dragged Miss Harnum back into their unit before her death (above) The accused man said he did not know . what apoplectic meant, resulting in Mr Tedeschi putting to him that he . was ‘berserk’ and ‘beside himself with anger’. ‘I . was angry, yes,’ he agreed, adding that he was ‘humiliated’ and . ‘embarrassed’ that his fiancee had involved the help of two outsiders to . help her leave him. Shimmers . of light in a hallway captured on a pinhole camera suggested that Miss . Harnum had tried to leave her apartment for a second time before she . plunged to her death, it was suggested by Mr Tedeschi. The . court had heard previously that Gittany had installed the pinhole . camera for security reasons, but the camera had also captured him with . his hands clasped around Miss Harnum’s mouth as she tried to leave the . apartment. The prosecutor . wanted to know if Gittany could explain why shimmers of light in the . hallway suggested that someone had tried to open the door a second time . after she had originally run into the hall and cried for help at a . neighbour’s door. Mr Tedeschi told the court the light flashes were evidence of a struggle between the couple. Evidence: CCTV footage shows Simon Gittany holding his hands on his head as he rides a lift moments after he allegedly threw his fiancee to her death off the 15th-floor balcony of their Sydney apartment . Gesticulating: Gittany throws his hands up in the air as he heads to the ground floor where the body of his girlfriend is lying in the street . ‘I suggest to you that she was screaming for help and banging on the neighbour’s door because you had said or done something that made her think her life was in imminent danger,’ said the prosecutor. ‘What do you say to that?’ ‘Absolutely not,’ Gittany replied - and he told the court he could not explain why the door may have opened a second time. He said he did not make any attempt to go near it after they were both back inside after Miss Harnum had first left. ‘She didn’t even have time to take off her handbag she’d had in the hallway before you threw her off the balcony,’ the prosecutor suggested. ‘Absolutely not,’ said Gittany. He was pressed on his claim that after Miss Harnum had been ‘subdued’ and dragged back into the apartment she had sat calmly on a sofa while he prepared her a cup of tea. ‘That just didn’t happen did it?’ asked Mr Tedeschi. ‘It did happen,’ replied Gittany. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Simon Gittany texted Lisa Harnum: 'Your eyes should gaze on me, the one'

The Florida socialite at the centre of the sex scandal that brought down former CIA director David Petraeus has waded into the NSA spy row claiming the FBI 'illegally' snooped through her and her husband's emails. Jill Kelley went to the FBI after receiving threatening emails from Petraeus's mistress Paula Broadwell warning her off her lover. The subsequent investigation led to Petraeus's affair being exposed and forcing his resignation as CIA director. Jill Kelley (right) claims the FBI illegally searched through her and husband Scott's (left) emails after she authorised them to look at just one of the threatening messages she received from David Petraeus's mistress . General John Allen, the top US . commander in Afghanistan, became ensnared in the scandal after it was . revealed he sent thousands of emails to Kelley. Kelley, 38, who sued the FBI and . Department of Defense in June for leaking her name to the media, claims . she authorised investigators to look at just one of the threatening . emails in the hope they would identify the stalker. But she claims that in a flagrant breach of trust, the FBI ignored her . request and unlawfully scoured through and her and her husband Scott's private . emails without revealing who had been sending the messages. Kelley claims the FBI then turned her and her husband into targets of an . 'intrusive' investigation , leaking their identities to the media and . distorting the contents of the emails they had illegaly. Writing in the Wall Street Journal she said: 'As a result of the . government's breach of our privacy and trust, camera crews showed up at . our door and camped outside our home to question us about false and . misleading information leaked to the media from 'unnamed' government . sources. 'Reckless speculation and innuendo about an inappropriate relationship . with Gen. Allen spread throughout the news media, sullying my reputation . and honor, to the great distress of my family. To this day the . government has not apologized for its indefensible conduct. 'I hope that my family's story is a case study about the damage that can be caused by the government's electronic overreach.' Former CIA Director David Petraeus shakes hands with author Paula Broadwell. It was later revealed that the two were having an affair . In the wake of the NSA spying row, Kelley believes her case is an . example of how Government agencies are over stepping the mark and . potentialy acting illegally. She added: 'I hope that my family's story is a case study about the . damage that can be caused by the government's electronic overreach. 'It appears from the NSA's leaks that the government may be trying to . collect everything about everyone and everywhere—including America's . closest friends and allies—with or without the knowledge of the White . House. 'Unaccountable individuals given free rein to invade people's . privacy—and a government that maintains the tools that permit them to do . so—are a prescription for a privacy disaster.' Speaking in June after suing the FBI . and Department of Defense Kelley said her involvement in the scandal 'shook my life' and 'changed our country's leadership'. She added: 'It was under the faithful . direction of our concerned military leaders that I went to the law . enforcement to seek the proper protection for my family, our commanders, . and top U.S. officials. 'But, unfortunately, we did not . receive the confidentiality and protection. Instead we received highly . hurtful and damaging publicity from willful leaks from high level . government officials that were false and defamatory.' The . couple's lawsuit claims the FBI and the military violated the Privacy . Act, the Stored Communications Act and the Fourth and Fifth Amendments . by collecting emails Jill Kelley exchanged with military leaders and by . releasing her name to the public. Former CIA director and retired general David H. Petraeus speaks at the University of Southern California after an affair with author Paula Broadwell ended his distinguished career in the military . They also filed privacy and defamation actions against several 'John Does'. The . Kelleys are seeking an apology, a declaration that the FBI violated the . Stored Communications Act, fair compensation and attorneys' fees, . according to their attorneys. The subsequent investigation led to Broadwell being exposed as Petraeus's mistress and led to his resignation as CIA director. General John Allen, the top US commander in Afghanistan, became ensnared in the scandal after it was revealed he sent thousands of emails to Kelley. Kelley knew both men from throwing lavish parties for military chiefs based at MacDill Airforce base near her home in Tampa, Florida. In the fallout from the scandal, Kelley was stripped of her role as a honorary consul for South Korea. She was forced to return her vanity car registration plates and banned from MacDill Airforce Base.","Jill Kelley authorised FBI to look at just one of the threatening emails she received from Petareus's mistress Paula Broadwell .

Lou was put through to the Miss Personality of Great Britain final as a wild card last year and beat 60 other contenders to take the title. Lou spends six evenings a week working out in the gym and four hours every Sunday wrestling . Coming out on top in that competition means she is able to compete in the Miss Great Britain pageant this year. Lou, who wrestles men because of her 5ft 9in height, said: ‘There is a casual wear round, a bikini wear round and an evening wear round. ‘I am really lucky because the competition falls one day before my 27th birthday which is the cut-off age to enter Miss GB. ‘Everyone said I was really funny, quirky and lively last year. I chatted to everyone which is why I think I was crowned Miss Personality. ‘I am training hard at the moment to prepare myself for this year’s competition and am having lots of carbs and doing lots of cardio so I have a bikini-fit body to die for.’ Lou has been a wrestling fan since she was eight years old and her idols are fighting celebrities like Hulk Hogan and Chyna. Lou has had a £250 red, white and blue bikini costume made to help her stand out in front of the judges . The assistant stage manager added: ‘It wasn’t until I was 19 years old I met wrestler Chris Manns. He said for me to come and watch a show. ‘He helped me get into it and I haven’t looked back really.’ Mentor Chris, 35, from Gosport, Hants, who wrestles under the name of The Fearless Flatliner, said: ‘Lou is a class act who loves the sport. She has charisma, she is driven and she is tough. ‘If you look at her you might think ‘Hollyoaks and hair straighteners’ because she is so pretty but, trust me, she is a force to be reckoned with. I am so proud of her.’ Lou will be a contestant at the Miss Great Britain final in Leicester on November 15.","Lou Ballard trains in the gym 6 evenings and wrestles for 4 hours a week .

She is three months pregnant and happily settled, but love life wasn't always so blissful for Katie Piper. The model, 30, has gone from strength to strength since she survived an horrific acid attack arranged by her ex-boyfriend Daniel Lynch in 2008. But she reveals getting back into dating after the ordeal was 'awful'. 'When I started dating again, it was like being 13 or 14 because I'd forgotten - should you kiss on a date? What do you wear? When do you text back? Do you have to pretend you don't like someone when you do?' Blooming lovely: Katie Piper at The Inspiration Awards For Women 2013 at Cadogan Hall in London this week . In a frank interview with the Sun's Fabulous magazine, Katie said while all her friends were starting . to settle down she was 'feeling very insecure' and 'getting it all . wrong'. 'There were people I thought liked me who actually didn't, people who maybe just felt sorry for me or wanted to go on dates with me to ask me about the TV show rather than because they fancied me... When I got rejected, instead of thinking ""Oh well"" I'd take it really badly. It was like being a little girl with no experience,' she said. Katie is now coupled up with her boyfriend of 18 months, whom she keeps out of the limelight. They are expecting their first child together. She said: 'I'm in love. With my boyfriend, it was never an issue or a big conversation. He would've known the news story about the girl who had acid thrown in her face, but he didn't know the ins and outs... It was me who brought it up in the end.' Through the other side: She reveals after an 'awful' time getting back into dating, she's settled . In May 2009, Lynch and Sylvestre were told by the judge that they were 'the face of pure evil'. Both were jailed for life and Lynch will serve a minimum of 16 years. Despite scarring her physically for life, the model from Andover, Hampshire, has enjoyed a successful career as a charity campaigner, presenter and spokesperson in the five years since suffering the life-changing event. Katie . announced just a fortnight ago that she was 'beaming' after going to . her 12-week scan last week, described the news of her pregnancy as . 'beyond incredible'. Speaking of the happy news: 'I've always . known that I have wanted children but there were moments after what . happened to me that I never thought this would happen, I never believed . this would be my future. 'It's beyond incredible,' she said, speaking to The Sunday Mirror. 'It's because I'm so happy about it that it's been so hard keeping quiet and I'm actually relieved to be able to tell everyone.' Fans quickly reacted to the good news on Twitter, prompting Katie to reply she has been 'Overwhelmed by all the congratulations tweets and best wishes! Thank you so much has completely taken my mind of todays morning sickness! X' Campaigner: Katie Piper is part of a groundbreaking M&S ad . campaign including a new short film . The good news is a far cry from her . her distressing experience five years ago, when violent ex-boyfriend . Lynch raped Katie and held her captive in a London hotel for eight . hours. But his revenge for . being rejected seemingly knew no bounds and two days later, under his . direction, accomplice Stefan Sylvestre threw a cup of . industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face. The attack on a London street melted her face, blinded her in one eye and left her with horrific burns. Rushed . to the burns unit of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Katie was . showered with tap water for ten hours as medics fought to neutralise the . effect of the acid on her skin and prevent further damage. Eye drops were also administered every few minutes to try to wash the acid away. But . her injuries were unimaginable. The left side of Katie's face was . burned away to the fat layer - the only thing beyond it was muscle and . bone. She lost the sight in . her left eye and acid also dripped down her neck, ears and hands as well . as slipping into her nose and throat, with further terrible . consequences. Before and after: Katie had been an aspiring model before the attack in 2008, which left her with horrific burns . For more than a . year she had to be fed through a tube in her stomach and surgery to . dilate her oesophagus. In total, she has endured more than 40 operations . since the attack. As . well as the physical damage, the attack left Katie fearful of going out . in public and her self-esteem was at had all time low as she hated . seeing her scarred face, which she had to cover with a protective mask . for two years. Katie has since won widespread support for her series of thought-provoking . documentaries for Channel 4, written three books about her experience . and has won awards - including Woman of the Year in 2011 and a Pride of . Britain award. She has also . set up her own charity, The Katie Piper Foundation, to help other burn . victims receive medical and emotional support. Katie . is also now one of the new stars of the Marks & Spencer campaign, . appearing alongside actress Helen Mirren and British female boxing . champion Nicola Adams.","Katie Piper was scarred for life after acid attack arranged by her ex in 2008 .

"By . Wills Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 04:15 EST, 16 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:09 EST, 16 September 2013 . Report: PC Shaun Jenkins, 36, was on patrol when he picked up a woman in an armed response vehicle and took her back to his house for 40 minutes while his colleague waited outside . An armed policeman who had sex on duty with a loaded gun in a holster attached to his belt has kept his job after a tribunal concluded it was similar to an officer taking a break to buy a cup of tea. PC Shaun Jenkins, 36, was on patrol with Gwent Police in 2010 when he picked up another man's wife for a 40-minute tryst. He took his mistress back to his home in Caerphilly, South Wales, while a colleague waited outside. But a report into his conduct found the act did not pose a risk to public safety because he could have been back within 'a minute or two'. An appeals tribunal report into the incident, obtained under Freedom of Information legislation by The Times, concluded that it was 'the sort of delay that will occur if an officer goes to the toilet or into a café to buy a cup of tea'. The tribunal overturned the original decision by the Gwent Police panel to dismiss PC Jenkins, who is now a neighbourhood beat officer after he was stripped of his firearms licence. Jenkins, who has won two awards for his bravery, was initially sacked by the force in 2011 for gross misconduct. But he was allowed to keep his job after an appeal concluded his gun was never out of his control because he could reach it while it was in the holster by his ankles. It also found he was still able to protect the public because he was contactable by radio. The Independent Police Complaints Commission then questioned his reinstatement in August and said the case had undermined public confidence in the police discipline system. Headquarters: The report into PC Jenkins' dismissal from Gwent Police said the act was similar to an officer taking a tea break or going to the lavatory . Following the decision by the Police Appeals Panel in August, the Head of the IPCC in Wales, Tom Davies, said he was ‘bemused’ by the findings and said the way Gwent Police had dealt with the case was unacceptable. He said: ‘The finding that the gun was never out of PC Jenkins’s direct and immediate control because it was in a holster, attached to his trousers, which were attached to him, albeit around his ankles, is surprising.’ ‘I am also bemused by the panel’s conclusion that his conduct did not significantly downgrade the protection to the public because there was nothing to suggest he could not have been back in the police vehicle within a minute or two. ‘These findings can only undermine public confidence in the credibility of the police discipline system.’ ‘Any officer having sex on duty is unacceptable behaviour that falls well below what is expected of all police officers. ‘Those who carry firearms are rightly subject to the highest standards of training, procedures and discipline.'","PC Shaun Jenkins, 36, left his patrol car to have sex with another man's wife while working for Gwent Police in South Wales .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:31 EST, 6 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:56 EST, 6 November 2013 . A prison inmate today testified that a Mormon doctor accused of killing his wife admitted to the crime by telling him: 'I'm getting away with the murder of my wife.' The testimony came as the trial in Provo, Utah resumed on Wednesday in the case against Martin MacNeill, who is accused of killing his wife Michele in April 2007 so that he could be with his mistress. Witness Jason Poirier recounted his conversation with MacNeill in December 2012 at Utah County jail, a few months after MacNeill's arrest in the death. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Attorney Randy Spencer, right, questions Jason Poirier, a former inmate who served time with Martin MacNeill, a doctor accused of killing his wife. Poirier said MacNeill acknowledged the murder . Poirier, who was being held on suspicion of shoplifting at the time, told the court that the conversation started when he asked MacNeill how he was able to get away with wearing custom-made shoes in jail. He said MacNeill replied: 'I can get away with a lot of things. I'm getting away with the murder of my wife.' A few days later, Poirier said, he asked MacNeill if the remark had been serious. The doctor replied he was serious, threw up his arms and said, 'Look where I'm at,' Poirier claimed. Poirier took the stand under a limited . grant of immunity. Defense lawyers attacked Poirier's credibility by . getting him to acknowledge he thought he would avoid charges by . informing on MacNeill. On trial: MacNeill is accused of killing his wife with a lethal cocktail of drugs so he could continue an affair . Three other prison inmates testified on Tuesday that MacNeill regularly cursed his wife and bragged that investigators couldn't prove he killed her. One inmate said MacNeill referred to his wife as a 'b****' and that he said: 'If I did [kill her] they don't have any evidence.' Those inmates were from a federal prison in Texas where MacNeill was held on fraud charges. Prosecutors are now nearing the end of . their mostly circumstantial case against MacNeill and are expected to . wrap up their evidence on Wednesday. Prosecutors say MacNeill, 57, hounded . his wife to get cosmetic surgery then knocked her out with painkillers, . Valium and sleeping pills before leaving her to die in the tub. Affair: Prosecutors claim that MacNeill killed his wife to be with his mistress, Gypsy Willis, pictured last week . Loss: MacNeill, a former Sunday school teacher, and his wife Michele had eight children together . Defense lawyers have argued that MacNeill had a heart attack and died after falling into a bathtub in 2007. But a cardiologist testified last Friday that Mrs MacNeill wasn't at risk of a heart attack. Utah cardiologist David Cragun told a court that the 50-year-old had a mild form of heart disease that wouldn't have killed her. Prosecutors called Cragun and another expert to suggest Michele MacNeill's death must have involved foul play. 'My opinion is that Michele died as a result of drowning,' testified Joshua Perper, a forensic pathologist from Florida. Anna Walthall, a mistress of Martin MacNeill, previously testified that he once described over 'pillow talk' how he could induce a heart attack in someone that would appear natural.","Jason Poirier, who was in jail with Martin MacNeill in December 2012, claimed doctor said: 'I'm getting away with the murder of my wife'
