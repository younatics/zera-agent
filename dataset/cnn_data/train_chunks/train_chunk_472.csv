"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 15:45 EST, 8 March 2012 . Border Agency staff enjoyed luxury cross channel trips with champagne and personal shopping services last year, it was revealed today. Workers also blew almost £1.2million of taxpayers' money on smart hotel rooms in Calais, France on overnight trips. Employees were allowed to travel Club Class on the 90-minute journey between Dover and Calais with P&O despite swingeing budget cuts and job losses. Luxury: UK Border Agency workers took 1,109 cross channel trips and travelled in Club Class with free champagne on a number of occasions . Luxury: Exclusive bar reserved for Club Class passengers - like UK Border Agency workers - who were also given free champagne and personal shoppers . Club Class - which costs around £12 extra . per trip - includes a complimentary glass of champagne, access to an . exclusive lounge with ‘wall to ceiling windows', on-call waiters and a . personal shopper who collects on-board purchases of alcohol, cigarettes . and perfume from the duty free shop for passengers. In total, staff crossed the channel 1,109 times last year. However, they were banned from travelling in luxury in February. The UK Border Agency also spent £1,181,838 on hotels for staff responsible for policing just two checkpoints in Calais last year, according to data released under freedom of information laws. Figures show that 14,496 rooms were booked in 2011 at an average of £76 each. The average price of a hotel in Calais - a run-down French port - is just over £45. The main hotel used by the UKBA - which is not allowed to be named for security reasons - has a swimming pool, gym, sauna, steam room, squash court, bar and restaurant. The total cost of the ferry travel for . 2011 came in at £44,266 - an average of £39.92 per crossing. Hotel stay: UK Border Agency workers were booked into French hotels 14,496 times last year. here a UK worker in Calais removes a Vietnamese immigrant from a lorry bound for Britain . The Border Agency said staff were banned from travelling Club Class in February last year because it almost doubled the cost of a trip. Before February the monthly travel bill was around £7,000 - but it has since dropped to just under £4,000 per month. The UK Border Agency - which is to be split in two after a damning report showed that around 500,000 Europeans arriving by Eurostar had not been checked against a list of suspected terrorists and criminals since 2007 - are responsible for guarding six checkpoints in France. Just two, however, are in Calais - including the ferry terminal and the Gare de Calais-Frethun rail station. Charlie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover said: 'More than £1 million is a lot of public money to spend on hotel bills. 'I would hope UKBA is getting best value for money and its uses . of hotels are cost-effective, when you consider the economic climate . facing the general public and the country.' P&O luxury: The Club Class trip which costs £12 extra per crossing was banned by the UK Border Agency in February last year to save money . Robert Oxley, campaigns manager of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said staff should always cross the channel on the cheapest available tickets. He said: 'UKBA staff seem to have hopped across to France an incredible amount. 'They have to ensure trips across the Channel don't get out of hand because the taxpayers are picking up the bill. 'Taxpayers shouldn't pay for staff to sip champagne in Club Class - officials should always travel on the cheapest ticket available.' A UK Border Agency spokesperson said they had banned Club Class travel in february 2011. 'We stopped staff travelling this way more than a year ago and are looking at other ways of driving down costs to provide better value for the taxpayer,' she said. 'Our officers operate round the clock at ports in northern France, last year stopping around 4,500 illegal immigrants entering the UK and we are already reviewing shift patterns to remove the need for overnight stays.'","Civil servants given a free glass of champagne and access to an exclusive lounge on ferries .

Billionaire Warren Buffett's company is making another foray into newspapers, agreeing to buy 63 newspapers from Media General Inc. for $142 million. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is also extending a loan to Media General and taking a 19.9 per cent stake in the company, which will still own 18 TV stations. Buffett has defended newspapers, saying that they will have a decent future if they continue delivering information that can't be found elsewhere. Buying power: Warren Buffett, seen at a a newspaper tossing competition on May 5, just purchased 63 newspapers across the U.S. They also need to stop offering news free online, he has said. 'In towns and cities where there is a strong sense of community, there is no more important institution than the local paper,' Buffett said in a statement Thursday. 'The many locales served by the newspapers we are acquiring fall firmly in this mould and we are delighted they have found a permanent home with Berkshire Hathaway.' That's a reversal of his opinion in 2009, when he told Berkshire shareholders that most newspapers faced the possibility of unending losses because the industry had lost its essential nature. Good news: Buffet's company purchased papers like the Richmond Times-Dispatch, left, and the Winston-Salem Journal, right; both are Thursday's front pages .

The Olympic Flame was officially handed over to London yesterday in an Athens ceremony, featuring a 2012 delegation including David Beckham, Boris Johnson and Princess Anne. The historic event took place in a rain-hit sundown ceremony at the Panathenaic stadium in Athens, venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896. But the flame stayed lit and will now make its way back to the UK where it will start a 70-day 8,000 mile relay around Britain.

Wet delegation: David Beckham (centre) and Mayor of London Boris Johnson (right) during the handover ceremony . Despite the buzz surrounding the last-minute news that the LA Galaxy star was flying in specially to be part of the ancient ceremony, the more formal duties came down to the Princess Royal as leader of the British delegation to Athens. Both she and Karolos Papoulias, the Hellenic Republic president, sat in ancient thrones that are part of the stadium during the hour-long ceremony. The flame was handed to the Princess, who was watched closely by other members of the official delegation including London 2012 chairman Lord Coe, Olympics minister Hugh Robertson, London mayor Boris Johnson, Beckham and five British sporting teenagers. Each member of the British VIP delegation sheltered under blue umbrellas as they walked through the centre of the stadium to their front-row seats. Everyone from the Princess Royal to Mr Robertson were named over the loudspeakers and greeted by cheers from the crowd. There was also a chuckle from British people in the crowd as the announcer twice insisted on introducing Beckham as 'Sir David Beckham'. Nearly everyone will get a chance to see the Olympic flame up close . And the hosts refused to let the rain dampen proceedings, beginning the ceremony with a torch relay before some traditional dancing and music. Afterwards, the Mayor of London joked: ‘I can’t testify to the accuracy of the music or dances but I still thought they were fantastic.’ Organisers also won over Beckham by producing a group of schoolchildren to sing God Save The Queen, to which he mouthed every word. Speaking in a BBC interview carried out before the ceremony began, Anne said: 'There's an awful lot of people for who the torch relay is the signal, the beginning of what the Olympics is all about.' But she insisted it was important to see the Games as an opportunity, rather than an extravagance - at a time of economic difficulty. The princess added: ""There has been an awful lot of employment maintained and to some extent increased largely as a result of the Games taking place. 'And for some of those they will have gained skills because people have concentrated on the apprenticeship side of the equation...' 'So yes I understand that it looks like an extravagance but if they recognise the way a lot of that money has been spent, it's made a constructive impact on people's lives, particularly those setting out.' Princess Anne watches the handover ceremony from a ceremonial marble throne . Lighting the flame: Greek veteran weighlifter Piros Dimas and Chinese gymnast Li Ning light a cauldron with the Olympic Flame inside the Panathenaic stadium in Athens . London Mayor Boris Johnson, meanwhile, described the event as an 'an amazing day for us'. He added: 'This is the moment when we prepare to take the torch and the eyes of the world are swivelling to London. I think they will see a city that has made phenomenal progress in getting ready ... by any, London is extraordinarily well prepared. In his speech, Lord Coe thanked the damp crowd in the stadium for Greece's warm hospitality and also for 'laying on the British weather for us'. The past week had linked Britain and Greece in a 'very special way in the spirit of peace and friendship', he said. Lord Coe added: 'If the Olympic Games are about celebrating the best athletes in the world, the Olympic spirit is about celebrting the best in ourselves and in our communities. 'We have found the very best torchbearers who, like Olympic athletes, will inspire a generation. 'As we prepare to bring the flame to the UK, we are reminded of our responsiblity - like that of our predecessors in 1908 and especially 1948 - to stage Games that use the power of sport to unite the world in a celebration of achievement and inspiration in challenging times. A Games that will inspire the next generation to choose sport.' Ceremonial: Greek athlete Niki Liosi lights her Olympic torch from a cauldron with the Olympic Flame atop the Athens Acropolis . Flags: The British and Greek flags are carried into the Panathenaic stadium during an Olympic Flame handover . The youngsters taking part in the handover were picked by London 2012 for displaying Olympic values. During the ceremony they exchanged symbolic olive branches to the tune of John Lennon's Imagine. The five, who come from different national regions, are from schools and colleges which are part of London 2012's Get Set education network and school linking programmes run by the British Council. The Olympic Flame has been taken on a relay around the Greek mainland and islands since it was lit by the rays of the sun in ancient Olympia last week. The torchbearers have been taking it from Olympia to the Panathenaic Stadium. The Olympic flame was ""laid to rest"" at the Acropolis overnight before being taken on the eighth and final day of its Greek relay - taking it to the Acropolis Museum, the centre of Athens, Zappeio and to the handover ceremony. A trio of world champions brought the flame safely to the stadium. It arrived in the hands of rower Christina Giazitzidou and was carried by gymnast Vasilis Tsolakidis and rower Alexandra Tsiavou. Chinese gymnast Li Ning, who lit the cauldron at the opening ceremony for the 2008 Beijing Games, and Greek weightlifter Pyrros Dimas were the last torchbearers in Greece. The ceremony also included priestesses in a performance choreographed by Artemis Ignatiou. The British delegates fly back tomorrow evening, landing at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall, where they will attend a special ceremony welcoming the flame. The flame has been given special clearance to travel onboard a plane. It will rest in a special cradle and be secured into its seat by a secure holding device. When it arrives on British soil, a 70-day relay, involving 8,000 torchbearers covering 8,000 miles, will take the flame to east London's Olympic Stadium and the opening of the Games on July 27.

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . UPDATED: . 05:28 EST, 17 May 2012 . Thierry Henry has abandoned plans to build a giant fish tank in a house he wants knock down and re-develop because it doesn't suit the needs of his family. The ex-Arsenal striker was given the green light to demolish his £6million mansion in Hampstead, North London, and build another but there was a last minute change to the application. Documents submitted to Camden Council a day before it was due to go before a planning committee are pretty much the same but with an omission - the three-storey aquarium. Footballer Thierry Henry's new house plan has angered his neighbours but now the plan for an aquarium (bottom left) will not go ahead . The original plans showed a 40ft high fish tank stretching 15ft across and going from from the basement up to the roof of the second floor. The four separate tanks on top of one another would have been worth around £250,000 and would have held 5,500 gallons of water. It would have housed 300 fish and cost £12,000 a year to run, making the super-size aquariums owned by the likes of Madonna, the Beckhams and Premier League footballer Stephen Ireland look like tiddlers. One local, who asked not to be named, said: 'Thierry obviously had his heart set on the aquarium. 'But in the end everyone around here was saying he was only demolishing the old house so he could get the fish tank specially made to his liking. 'Knocking down a perfectly good 13-year-old house worth in the region of £10m is not something that is looked upon kindly if it is just to put a fish tank in, so a lot of us think he got round the council simply by saying he would get rid of the aquarium.' Flash home: Conti, whose garden backs on to Henry's home, and seven others have urged planning officials halt the proposal saying 'If someone wants a larger house why do they not just buy one somewhere else?' Celebrity battle: Henry, left was urged by neighbour Tom Conti, right, to move out of his £6 million London home rather than demolish it for a larger house to accommodate a monster 40ft fish tank . Actor Tom Conti, who is a neighbour of Henry's in Hampstead, north London, led an attack against the plans, but the councillors gave their consent for the building to be knocked down and re-built. Henry - Arsenal’s record goalscorer who now plays for the New York Red Bulls - did not attend the meeting. Camden councillor Jonathan Simpson described the designs as ‘fantastic’, adding: ‘It is an outstanding contribution to the borough.’ Conti, the 70-year-old actor best known for his portrayal of Greek taverna owner Costas in the film Shirley Valentine, claimed the building of the house would cause massive disruption and was not suited to the area. Henry argues that his house, built in 1999, has aged badly and is not fit for purpose as a family home. Plans: Henry intends to rebuild his Hampstead home, although the original architect Sir Richard MacCormac is opposed to the demolition . ‘Its interior spaces are cramped, deteriorated and commercial in feel, with low ceilings, narrow rooms and poor daylight,’ according to papers submitted to the council by Montagu Evans, the agents acting on his behalf. The row in leafy Hampstead has been brewing since February, when French footballer Henry applied for planning permission. The French footballer – who fronted the ‘va-va-voom’ TV adverts for car firm Renault – is the latest in a long line of celebrities to take an interest in flashy fish tanks. Madonna, the Beckhams, Cher and Premier League footballers Stephen Ireland, Joe Hart and Micah Richards, have all splashed out on opulent fish tanks. Ireland has reportedly spent more than £100,000 on his 13ft aquarium, and is now believed to be planning a shark tank under his kitchen floor. It has been suggested that the celebrity obsession with aquariums may not be just about a fondness for fish. One tank designer, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Our client list tends to be male-dominated and they are looking for status symbols and showpieces.’ Henry bought his house in 2001 when he was married to model Claire Merry. The couple divorced in 2007. But he is understood to be keen to maintain his London base to be close to their young daughter, Tea. His new home will also include a swimming pool and gym.

Ireland has reportedly spent more than £100,000 on his 13ft aquarium, and is now believed to be planning a shark tank under his kitchen floor. Henry’s new home is expected to take about six months to complete. Before news of the successful planning application Mr Conti said: ‘They’ll be drilling into the basement and it’ll go on for months and months. 'There are a lot of retired people round here or people like me who work from home – I write – and it’s a terrible disturbance.‘Why do they have to knock it down? I’ve never met Thierry Henry and I’ve got nothing against the man at all. I’m sure he’s a very nice man and he’s welcome to build whatever he likes. But please not here, not next to me, with all the noise.’ Conti added: ‘This used to be a wonderful place to live, but in the last ten years there’s been endless, endless building.’They’ll be drilling into the basement and it’ll go on for months and months. Trading is only permitted under strict Government regulations. The house’s original architect, Sir Richard MacCormac, a former chairman of the Royal Institute of British Architects, opposed Henry’s application. He said the house has ‘good daylighting and is in good condition but appears not to have been well maintained’. Influential civic group the Heath and Hampstead Society had also called for the application to be thrown out, saying the design of the new house ‘has no style or elegance’.","Aquarium didn't appear after last-minute change in planning application .

This chilling picture shows an arsonist hiding behind a Halloween mask moments after he set an elderly couple's cottage ablaze as they slept inside. He was captured on CCTV fleeing the scene after he shoved a home-made fire bomb through the letterbox of pensioners Peter and Sylvia Cox at their home in the village of Castle Bytham, Lincolnshire. The frail pair, aged 83 and 75 respectively, were forced to scramble from an upstairs window with the help of neighbours as flames engulfed their picturesque 17th century home. Chilling: This CCTV grab, released to the Press by police, shows the horror mask which the arsonist hid behind after he firebombed the home of pensioners Sylvia and Peter Cox in the dead of night . They only survived thanks to their beloved greyhound Toby, who woke them by barking as the blaze took hold. The noise also alerted neighbours who brought a ladder from their garage, enabling the Coxes to climb to safety. Sadly, Toby was recovering from an operation and would not climb the stairs. He died in the fire, which destroyed the roof of the £400,000, five-bedroom detached stone cottage. Police have released the picture as they this week issued a fresh appeal for information that could help track down the culprit behind the cold-blooded attack. Incredibly it was the fourth time the Coxes' home had been targeted by arsonists in a matter of months. Gutted: Flames destroyed the roof of the Coxes' £400,000, five-bedroom detached stone cottage. Their beloved greyhound, Toby, who raised the alarm, tragically died in the inferno . The couple’s home was first attacked in August and October 2010 and again in March and May last year. Each arson attack involved a thug hurling crude petrol bombs using fireworks in glass bottles. The first three firebombs failed to ignite properly, but on the fourth occasion the couple woke to find their stone cottage filled with smoke. In a frantic 999 call, a terrified Mr Cox told the operator: 'We’re on fire, the house in on fire and there is smoke everywhere. 'I’m inside and I’m not sure how we can get out.' Murky: Another CCTV image captured near the Coxes' home shows the arsonist fleeing the scene by bicycle . 'Like a storyline from Midsomer Murders': Police still have no clue why the arsonist, or arsonists, targeted the Coxes . Following the attack on May 4 last year the couple reluctantly moved after police warned them against returning to their home of 30 years. At the time, the crimes were described as like a ‘story line from Midsomer Murders’ with detectives baffled as to why the couple had been repeatedly targeted. But despite the repeated fire bomb attacks, the defiant pensioners have now decided to return to the house - even though the arsonist is still at large. Yesterday, Mr and Mrs Cox said the decision to move back to their home was a difficult one to make. 'We have two daughters living in Staffordshire so we went and stayed with them,' Mr Cox said. 'It was nice to be near them and also the grandchildren and it stopped us thinking about the fire. 'My wife has been very strong. What she said to me, quite sensibly, was we have got to try it (move back home). 'At three o’clock in the afternoon it’s fine, it’s at three o’clock in the morning that it’s not so good.

Convicted: Angela Norman was found guilty of the involuntary manslaughter of her 14-year-old disabled daughter who only weighed 28 pounds at the time of her death . The mother of a 14-year-old girl with cerebral palsy who weighed 28 pounds when she died has been sentenced to nine years in prison. Angela Norman, 43, was sentenced in a Dayton, Ohio court on Thursday after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. Her daughter Makayla Norman was covered in bed sores and showed other signs of neglect when she died on March 1, 2011, said court authorities. The county coroner’s office attributed the teen's death to nutritional and medical neglect complicated by her chronic condition. 'She was the worst malnourished child this office has ever seen,' said Ken Betz, director of the coroner's office. Mrs Norman was indicted on the three counts last November. She pleaded guilty to a first-degree felony count of involuntary manslaughter and to single misdemeanor and felony counts of endangering children. Norman remained in jail with bail set at $250,000. Her attorney did not immediately return a call to his office. Prosecutor Mat Heck Jr. said that Angela Norman did not provide sufficient food or proper care for the child, resulting in her death. Neglected to death: Makayla Norman had numerous bed sores and showed signs of massive malnutrition when she died on March 1, 2011, according to authorities . Three nurses who authorities said were to administer or monitor the girl's care also were charged. Norman had been scheduled for trial April 18 with the other three defendants who have pleaded not guilty in the case. Mollie E. Parsons, 42, of Dayton, is charged with involuntary manslaughter, failing to provide for a functionally impaired person and tampering with records. Kathryn Williams, 42, of Englewood, and Mary K. Kilby, 63, of Miamisburg, both registered nurses, are each charged with failing to provide for a functionally impaired person and failing to report child abuse or neglect. Nurses: Mollie E. Parsons, 42, of Dayton (left), Kathryn Williams, 42, (center),  and Mary K. Kilby, 63, of Miamisburg (right)  have all been charged in connection with Makayla’s death . The teen was confined to her home and was supposed to be cared for by her mother and Parsons, a licensed practical nurse who was supposed work six days a week at the home, according to the prosecutor. Williams was paid to supervise Parsons, visit and inspect the living conditions, and do a physical assessment of the girl every 30 to 60 days. Kilby was scheduled to visit every six months to also check on conditions of the home and assess the girl's health, needs and care, the prosecutor has said.","Makayla Norman, 14, was riddled with bed sores and weighed only 28 pounds when she died .

Guilt: Michael Warrener was found guilty of sexually abusing three girls at Newcastle Crown Court including his daughter Claire who went on to take her own life . A tragic woman killed herself after breaking her silence about the rapes she suffered as a child at the hands of her father. Newcastle Crown Court heard it wasn't until 2010, that Claire Warrener felt able to report the sexual abuse. She went to the police six years after the attacks committed by her father Michael Warrener had ended. She then took her own life when she was barely into her 20s, just months after going to the authorities. Warrener denied one charge of indecent assault and three of rape, but was found guilty by a jury after trial. The court had heard how he repeatedly abused Claire from when she was around 11-years-old. Prosecutor Penny Moreland told the court how Claire, whose parents had split up, was living with her father when the abuse started. Miss Moreland said: 'He came to her bedroom when she was asleep.' Claire told police in her statement : 'I didn't know what had happened to me.' After the first incident of abuse, which happened when Warrener's then girlfriend had walked out on him, Claire's ordeal got worse. Miss Moreland said: 'The defendant again came into Claire's bedroom at night. That night he raped her. 'After that he raped her more often, as the problems in his relationship became greater, until he was having sex with her about three or four times per week.' Jury: Tragic Claire Warrener's father Michael Warrener was found guilty at Newcastle Crown Court of repeatedly raping his daughter who committed suicide as an adult, months after reporting her childhood abuse . Miss Moreland said: 'She told the police and on March 13 [2010] she made her statement.' Warrener was arrested and denied wrongdoing. Miss Moreland said: 'He said she might be making the allegation up because he had accused her three weeks earlier of stealing money from him.' Judge John Milford withdrew Warrener's bail and warned: I will sentence you, obviously, to a period of imprisonment that is going to be substantial. 'I also have to consider whether you are a dangerous offender and you will now be remanded in custody.' Warrener was also found guilty of indecent assaults on two other child victims at yesterday's hearing. Warrener, 59, of Twickenham Road, Sunderland, will be sentenced for all of his offending next week.","Sex assaults started when victim Claire Warrener was just 11-years-old .

Thousands of students are gaining degrees with relatively little work despite record numbers of firsts being handed out each year, a study shows. They are managing to graduate from some universities by putting in ‘much less effort’ than that demanded on degree courses at other more prestigious institutions. The Higher Education Policy Institute has warned that the finding raises an ‘uncomfortable question’ about degree standards. Thousands of students are gaining degrees with relatively little work despite record numbers of firsts being handed out each year, a study shows . Its report, The Academic Experience of Students at English Universities, comes as the number of graduates awarded first class degrees has soared by almost 50 per cent over the last five years. However critics have also accused universities of failing to provide value for money since the trebling of tuition fees to £3,000 in 2006 has not impacted on the amount of teaching students receive or the size of group tuition. Hepi surveyed over 9,000 first and second year students in English universities. It found that ‘in almost all subjects’, students in pre-1992 red-brick universities devoted more time to their work than students in ‘new’ universities - former polytechnics and specialist colleges. For example, in medicine and dentistry, students at pre-1992 universities have a total workload of 37.3 hours a week on average - including teaching and private study - compared to 34.5 hours in post-1992 institutions. In veterinary science, students at red brick universities devote 37.9 hours a week to work compared to 27 hours at former polytechnics while law students spend 31 hours and 26.5 hours respectively at the different institutions. However, there are also big differences between the amounts of effort required in different subjects. The number of graduates awarded first class degrees has soared by almost 50 per cent over the last five years . In ‘mass communications and documentation’ which includes media studies, students have a total workload of just 18.1 hours a week in older universities and 20.4 hours in newer universities. The average of 20.1 hours across all these institutions is akin to ‘part-time’ employment, whereas studying for medicine and dentistry is the equivalent of a ‘full-time job’. The report says the policy question that needs to be addressed ‘is what it says about a UK degree, if students can obtain degrees which are held to be comparable, while devoting very different amounts of effort to their studies’. The think-tank carried out similar surveys in 2006, 2007 and 2009 and discovered that students in English universities ‘by and large’ devote ‘far less effort’ to work than students in most other European countries. Speaking ahead of the latest report’s publication, Bahram Bekhradnia, Hepi’s director, said he suspected that students with degrees from this country’s universities ‘don’t have the depth of knowledge and understanding’ that many of their overseas rivals have. His report says: ‘Our degrees are already shorter than those elsewhere. ‘It appears also that less effort is required by our students during each week of study. ‘This raises potentially awkward questions, and indeed these are being posed by our European partners and those who sponsor students from overseas.’ Overall students reported an average of 13.9 hours of scheduled teaching per week across all types of institutions, compared to 14.2 hours in 2007 and 13.7 hours in 2006. Students have been ‘working a little harder’ in their own time, reporting 14.4 hours of private study a week, compared to 12.7 in 2007 and 13.1 hours in 2006. The report says that in terms of the amount of teaching contact students have and the size of groups in which they are taught, the increase in fees in 2006 has led to ‘no change’ in provision. Referring to the introduction of £9,000-a-year fees this Autumn, Sally Hunt, general secretary of the Universities and College Union, said: ‘We are entering a very dangerous period for higher education. ‘Students and their parents will expect more bang for the massively increased buck, but the reality is that universities simply cannot deliver more for less.’ Some 53,215 students gained firsts in 2010/11 (15.5 per cent) compared to 36,645 in 2006/7 (12.6 per cent). At the same time, 48.4 per cent of graduates - 166,100 - were awarded a respectable 2.1 in 2010/11, with only seven per cent - 24,825 - finishing with a third class.",Higher Education Policy Institute says it raises an 'uncomfortable question' about degree standards .

A newly released surveillance photo shows a bride in the silver sequined cocktail dress that she wore to her wedding last week - and which she still had on when police discovered her stabbed to death in her bathtub only days later. The release of the image comes as police and FBI continue to pore over more than 100 tips in an effort to locate Estrella Carrera's husband, 30-year-old Arnoldo Jimenez, who was charged in the killing. More than 30 law enforcement agencies had joined federal agents in the search for Jimenez, who married Carrera on Friday and allegedly stabbed her to death just hours later. Tragic: A surveillance image shows Estrella Carrera wearing the silver sequined dress that she was later found in after being stabbed in a bathtub . Investigators would not reveal in which states they are looking for Jimenez, only saying that it was ‘all over the country.’ ‘We are following every lead, no matter where it takes us,’ said Captain Joseph Ford, of the Burbank Police Department. Authorities began looking for Jimenez soon after Carrera's family reported that she failed to pick up her two children, ages two and ten, Saturday as she had arranged. The family had been unable to reach Carrera or Jimenez, so they asked police to check on her at her apartment in the suburb of Burbank. That is when the 26-year-old’s body was found in the bathtub, still clothed in the party dress she also may have worn at her wedding ceremony at Chicago's City Hall. There were no signs of forced entry into Carrera’s apartment, according to investigators. That day, the bride's family received a haunting phone call from a sister of her new husband, who told them he had called her weeping and said that he had left his bride bleeding after a ‘bad fight.’ Newlyweds: Police have launched a manhunt for Arnoldo Jimenez (left) who has been charged with stabbing to death his wife, Estrella Carrera (right), just two days after their wedding . Most of Carrera's family disapproved of her three–year relationship with Jimenez, even though he was the father of her two-year-old son. Jimenez had hit and bruised Carrera in the past, according to Carrera’s older sister, Jazmin. Police also said family members reported incidents of violence while the couple was dating. Jazmin Carrera described Jimenez as ‘very possessive’ and jealous. She said she does not understand why her sister married the 30-year-old in what seemed like a rushed ceremony that the bride had kept secret from almost everyone. Slain: Estrella Carrera's family became concerned when the mother of two failed to pick up her children on Sunday . Jazmin Carrera received a text message from her sister Friday, inviting her to join them and their friends at a Mexican restaurant and a nightclub to celebrate the nuptials. She chose not to attend. ‘It was just all of a sudden,’ Jazmin Carrera said. ‘She didn't give us enough notice.’ The pair were last seen around 4am on Saturday morning, according to officials. On Sunday, relatives heard about the phone call from Jimenez's sister, who said that when she tried to call her brother back, he would not pick up, according to Jazmin Carrera. Crime scene: Police who arrived at Carrera's apartment to check up on her discovered her dead in the tub, still wearing her party dress . Timeline: Police believe Carrera was killed shortly after she and Jimenez returned to her apartment in Burbank on Saturday . Police in Burbank said they are aware of the account and are looking into it. Authorities made a plea to Jimenez to turn himself in ‘for the sake of his family and especially his children,’ Ford said. Getaway car: Jimenez was last known to be driving a black 2006 Maserati with Illinois license plate L641441 . According to officials, Jimenez was previously arrested for domestic violence in another city in a case that did not involve Carrera. Police do not know what Jimenez does for a living, although he was last known to be driving a black 2006 Maserati with Illinois license plate L641441. Since the killing likely took place only hours after the couple went to Carrera's apartment, police said the suspect had plenty of time to flee the metropolitan area, or even the state. Investigators do not believe Jimenez is a danger to others, although they say they have no way of knowing his current state of mind.","Estrella Carrera, 26, married on Friday night and was last seen 2am on Saturday morning .

A father-of-two who was on a stag weekend with five friend when a lift got stuck and plunged 100ft to the concrete ground is suing the hotel over his injuries. Stephen Dinsdale, 44, has endured terrifying flashbacks and gruelling physiotherapy since the accident two years. IT analyst Mr Dinsdale was on a stag weekend at the Hotel Victoria in Newquay, Cornwall, when he caught the lift with five friends. The lift runs between the beach and hotel through the cliff. But as the men were inside the lift it ground to a halt. The stag party was told the lift would be manually winched back down to the ground floor by hotel staff. But while the rescue mission was taking place the lift fell 100ft to the  sandy cove below the hotel. The lift hit the concrete base of the lift shaft and the door buckled in the impact, trapping guests from the double stag party - including both grooms. The group endured a 45-minute ordeal where they were stuck waiting for lifeboats to reach them because of the high tide. An investigation into the accident uncovered that the lift had not been through a thorough examination since July 2008 due to the presence of asbestos. Less detailed inspections of the lift, dated from 2008 - 2010, identified a number of defects and the lift had become stuck, with passengers trapped inside, on previous occasions, Mr Dinsdale’s lawyers claimed. Mr Dinsdale, from Walton, Surrey, needed ligament reconstructive surgery as well as extensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation after the incident. He is now taking legal action against the lift manufacturers and hotel owners after the accident in in April 2010. According to Russell Jones and Walker solicitors, the reconstructive surgery itself posed massive risks and he faced the prospect of losing his leg completely. Mr Dinsdale said: 'The whole experience was just terrifying, we were meant to be on a stag weekend having a great time but on the first day things just went drastically wrong. 'Although the accident itself was awful the lasting impact of my knee injury is what has really affected me and my family life. 'It breaks my heart that I can’t play with my children and they often ask why I can’t run around with them like all the other dads. The private lift, built to transport guests to a small cove below the clifftop hotel, plunged from the first floor all the way to sea level . 'The settlement will help me get the best rehabilitation so I can hopefully get my life back on track.' Fellow guest Carl White described the ordeal as 'terrifying'. While his friend Neil McCracken said: 'The doors were open and we could see the walls flashing past. 'The fire brigade and RNLI came out because the tide had come in. We could see the sea at the end of the lift shaft. We are at sea level and someone at the hotel said the tide was coming in. 'It was pretty scary, we did not know whether we would drown trapped in this lift shaft. 'We were extremely worried.' Mr Dinsdale, who injured his knee in the fall, in his hospital bed with fellow stag party reveller Neil McCracken alongside . The father-of-two has been receiving treatment on his left leg, pictured, after the accident in the beach lift in Newquay, Cornwall . Kimberley Owen, principal lawyer at Russell Jones and Walker, part of Slater and Gordon Lawyers, said: 'Court proceedings have been issued as responsibility for the accident is yet to be admitted in full by the two defendants, Otis ltd, the manufacturer and installer of the lift, and PAVH International, which owns and runs the Hotel Victoria. 'We hope that the issuing of court proceedings will help focus the defendants’ minds and enable Mr Dinsdale’s case to reach a speedy conclusion so he can attempt to rebuild his life.' Eighty five rescuers including coastguards, lifeboatmen, firefighters, police and ambulance crews were involved in the rescue. The other rescued members of the stag party, from left, Carl White, Mark Wilkinson, Neil McCracken, Colin Floyd and Tony Goodwin . They had to be freed by firemen and then taken by lifeboats from the sea covered cove to waiting paramedic teams. Jamie Luke, hotel general manager, said staff had tried unsuccessfully to lower the lift manually to the ground floor. He said: 'The lift hit the fall arrestor and in doing so we believe overshot past the beach ground level. 'It was a very stressful time for all concerned.'","Stephen Dinsdale was on stag party with five friends when beach lift broke .

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 10:05 EST, 16 March 2012 . When a Georgia judge sentenced a former General Electric supervisor to life in prison without parole for killing his subordinate's husband outside a preschool, the case seemed far from closed. That's because the focus of the month-long trial was as much on the victim's wife, Andrea Sneiderman, as it was on the accused. After Hemy Neuman was found guilty but mentally ill yesterday of the November 2010 murder of Russell 'Rusty' Sneiderman, the question quickly became whether prosecutors would charge her with a crime in her husband's death. Possible suspect: Now that Neuman has been convicted, all eyes turn to widow Andrea Sneiderman, who could have played a role in her late husband's demise . Taken away: Hemy Neuman was sentenced to life in prison, but will receive mental aide whilst behind bars . Weeping: Rusty's father Don Sneiderman reacts after the reading of the verdict yesterday . Neuman's defence attorneys and Russell Sneiderman's family said they hope to see prosecutors investigate Andrea Sneiderman in the killing. Russell Sneiderman's brother, Steve, said the family has long suspected Andrea was involved in Russell's death, and the trial only confirmed their suspicions. 'Why? What is she hiding? These questions must be answered and answered soon,' he said. Steve Seniderman added: 'We'll have no peace until everyone involved in Rusty's death is held accountable for their actions. In the meantime it's clear to me that Andrea is covered in Rusty's blood.' DeKalb County District Attorney Robert James said his office is reviewing the case and, when pressed after the trial on whether imminent charges would be filed related to the victim's wife, he said: 'Stay tuned.' 'Everybody's asking that question,' said Mr James. 'And I'm not going to stand up here and be disingenuous and say that's something that's not being considered.' Guilty: Hemy Neuman reacts to the verdict today as he faces the prospect of life in prison without parole . Andrea Sneiderman has denied knowing anything about the shooting and her attorney said after the verdict that her client was grateful for the conviction and sentence. She wouldn't comment on the possibility of a criminal investigation. 'Nothing can bring back her husband,' said attorney Jennifer Little, 'but it is reassuring to her that, after all of the noise and distractions surrounding this case, some measure of justice has been done for Rusty.' Days of testimony during the trial targeted whether Andrea Sneiderman was involved in an affair with Neuman, whether she knew about the details of her husband's death suspiciously early and whether she worked with her former boss to cover it up. This week's closing arguments only ratcheted up the rhetoric. Insane: Hemy Neuman was found guilty today in the shooting death of Russell Sneiderman but will have to be treated in jail for his mental illness . Visions: Neuman claimed an angel who looked like Olivia Newton-John, left, appeared to him, as did a demon with the voice of Barry White, right . Attorney Doug Peters, who represented . Neuman, called her a 'tease' who took advantage of Neuman's rapidly . deteriorating mental state, saying that while his client may have had . the gun, 'the trigger, I respectfully suggest, was pulled by Andrea . Sneiderman.' James took it a step further, suggesting that the widow was . a 'co-conspirator.' 'Hemy didn't hide his crime from Andrea because Andrea already knew,' James said in the trial. J. Tom Morgan, a former DeKalb County . district attorney, said a prosecutor can't ethically accuse anyone of . the crime to the news media unless that person has been charged, . indicted or granted immunity. But that doesn't prevent a prosecutor . from suggesting a witness was involved in a criminal act to a jury as . long as the evidence backs it up. Secret conversation: Defendant Hemy Neuman, left, spoke with attorney Douglas N. Peters who fought his case on the grounds he was not guilty by reason of insanity . 'So the D.A. can do something in . closing he would be prohibited from doing in a press conference,' said . Morgan, who is now in private practice. 'Whether Robert is going to do . something with her after the trial is anyone's guess.' Peters said he's confident his client would testify if charges are brought and she goes to trial. 'I believe that she planted the seed. I believe that as primed the pump. I believe that as stoked the fire,' Peters said. 'And I believe the evidence in the case indicates quite . clearly that she wanted her husband murdered and that she manipulated . him.' Phone records showed Neuman and . Andrea Sneiderman exchanged multiple phone calls on the eve of her . husband's death and immediately after the killing. [caption . And while she testified she didn't . discover her husband had been shot until she reached the hospital about . an hour after the shooting, her father-in-law and a close friend both . said she called to deliver the bad news only minutes after he was shot. Andrea Sneiderman, who has repeatedly . denied being involved in an affair, said she made mistakes by holding . hands with Neuman, dancing with him at a bar and having long dinners . with him while on business trips. But she said she didn't report his . advances because she feared for her job, and didn't air her suspicions . that Neuman was involved because it seemed unfathomable. 'The theory that my boss could kill my husband, it seemed kind of stupid at the time,' she testified. Andrea Sneiderman was hired in early 2010 because her husband was having trouble finding a steady paycheck. She hit it off with Neuman and the . two exchanged 1,500 phone calls and text messages in the months before . the killing. On work trips, they shared intimate dinners and inside . jokes — and, attorneys say, sexual relations. Her husband, a Harvard-educated . entrepreneur who she met in college at Indiana University, was gunned . down on November 18, 2010 after dropping his two-year-old son off at . Dunwoody Prep. Police say a bearded man with a hoodie shot him four . times and sped away in a rented minivan. Torn apart: Russell Sneiderman was murdered after dropping his children off at daycare. His wife, Andrea, right, was allegedly having an affair with his accused killer . Neuman was charged with the crime about six weeks later. He pleaded not guilty by reason of . insanity, saying he couldn't tell the difference between right and wrong . during the shooting. His lawyers say he fell so hopelessly . in love with Andrea Sneiderman that he believed he was the father of . her two children and that the only way to protect them was to murder her . husband. 'We'll have no peace until everyone involved in Rusty's death is held accountable for their actions. In the meantime it's clear to me that Andrea is covered in Rusty's blood.' Prosecutors said Neuman simply wasn't . suffering from a 'made up' mental illness, only jealousy for what he . couldn't have. A jury agreed, rejecting Neuman's claim that he didn't . know the difference between right and wrong at the time of the killing. They found him guilty but mentally . ill, which means he'll have access to mental health treatment while . spending his life behind bars. Some legal experts who have been following the case said there were advantages to charging Neuman but not Andrea Sneiderman. 'The fact she wasn't indicted allowed . her to be called as a witness,' said John Petrey, an ex-DeKalb County . prosecutor who is now in private practice. 'And from the prosecution's . point of view it was important that the jury hear and see Andrea . Sneiderman. Had she been charged they couldn't have done that.' Petrey said prosecutors may take their . time and develop a strong case that could secure not just an indictment . but also a conviction. 'I'd marshal my best prosecutors and . see if there's enough to indict and convict Andrea because if they're . ready to make that leap they would want to be able to quickly take her . to trial,' he said. James, the district attorney, said his office will do its best to seek justice for the victim's family. 'It's something we're looking at. I . know it's important to this family. It's important to America,' James . said. 'But as a prosecutor I have an obligation to follow the facts ... and make a decision that seeks justice.' Scene of the crime: Randy Sneiderman was shot outside of Dunwoody Daycare Centre outside of Atlanta in 2010 . Andrea Sneiderman was hired in early . 2010, and she and Neuman hit it off, exchanging 1,500 phone calls and . text messages in the months leading up to the killing. On work trips, they would share long dinners and intimate moments, including sex, according to attorneys. Neuman didn't testify, but jurors . heard him through hours of video recordings of interviews with . investigators and mental health experts. In one interview, Neuman was asked if he thinks he's the biological father of Sneiderman's two children. 'I don't know. I don't know. I don't . know,' he said. 'I feel like these are my children. I feel like I need . to be there for them. I feel like I need to raise them and I need to . protect them. But I don't know.' Neuman's attorneys tried to portray . their client as a brilliant but troubled child who was constantly in . fear of his father, a Holocaust survivor wracked with guilt because he . was able to escape the death chambers at Auschwitz while many relatives . died. Born in Mexico, Neuman was sent to a . boarding school in Israel and still suffers from fear of being . abandoned, his attorneys said. He later landed the GE job that allowed him to buy a pricey home in an upscale Atlanta suburb. Neuman first tried to kill his rival . in November 10, 2010, when he camped outside the Sneiderman house with a . gun he recently purchased and waited to attack, prosecutors said. But he bolted after Russell Sneiderman noticed an intruder on his property and called police. Eight days later, prosecutors said, . Neuman arrived at his office much earlier than usual — at 5:36am — then . sneaked out a back door to avoid security cameras and to give himself an . alibi. Days later, Neuman went to Russell . Sneiderman's funeral and even visited Andrea Sneiderman's house for a . Jewish mourning ceremony, prosecutors said.","Hemy Neuman found guilty of gunning down co-worker's husband Russell Sneiderman in 2010 .

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 05:34 EST, 6 March 2012 . A former international cricket captain launched the first claim for libel on Twitter yesterday after being accused of match-fixing. Chris Cairns, 41, told the High Court his cricketing achievements had been turned to 'dust' by the allegation. He is suing Lalit Modi, ex-chairman of Twenty20 franchise the Indian Premier League over the Tweet. However, the case, brought by a New Zealand cricketer against an Indian businessman in British courts, has been slammed as a case of 'libel tourism'. Twitter libel claim: Former New Zealand cricket captain Chris Cairns, left, launched his libel claim against Lalit Modi, yesterday . The Tweet about domestic Indian cricket was read by just 95 people in Britain, Mr Justice Bean, who is hearing the case in the High Court without a jury, was told. However, Andrew Caldecott QC, representing Cairns said the Tweet in January 2010 was picked up by cricket website Cricinfo. When Cairns complained, Cricinfo withdrew . their report, paid damages and apologised - but Modi declined to . apologise and pleaded justification, maintaining that the charge was . true. Cairns’s case was that the allegation was . 'wholly untrue' and a very grave libel which would - if uncorrected - . destroy all he had achieved over a distinguished 20-year career. Cairns, 41, the former New Zealand captain, notched up the rare double of 200 wickets and 3,000 runs in his 62 Tests. In evidence, he said: 'The defendant’s allegations have also had a profound effect on my personal and private life. 'It put a strain on my marriage. It hurts that my wife may think that I am not the man she thought I was. 'It hurts me too that friends, many of whom are former cricketing foes, will question my integrity as a man and a sportsman and that all I achieved in the great game of cricket is dust.' Cricket star: Chris Cairns of New Zealand in action during the Twenty20 International match between New Zealand and the West Indies in 2006 . Mr Caldecott said that all-rounder Cairns, who lived in England as a child when his father Lance played here, had considerable affection for the UK and minded about his reputation here. At the time of the tweet, Modi was one of the most powerful men in the cricketing world and any statement of his was likely to be treated as soundly-based.

Counsel said that, in 2007 and 2008, Cairns captained the Chandigarh Lions in three competitions in the Indian Cricket League (ICL). The allegation made by Modi related to the second and third of these competitions, between March and April 2008 and October and November that year. Mr Caldecott said that, in October 2008, Cairns was called to an ICL directors meeting in a hotel room where, according to the cricketer, his denial of rumours of his alleged involvement in match-fixing appeared to be accepted. 'No specific charges of match-fixing were ever put to Mr Cairns. No names of any accusers were mentioned,' said Mr Caldecott. 'He was never informed after his departure that statements had been taken - mainly later - from Indian players alleging corrupt activity by various players including him.' Counsel said that Cairns was then effectively suspended for not declaring an ankle injury which had been exacerbated by a 1,000-kilometre charity walk completed in memory of his late sister. Mr Caldecott said that the initial publication of Modi’s tweet in the jurisdiction was up to 95 people while the initial publication of the Cricinfo article was between 450 and 1,500. 'Of course these receivers are bound to be cricket fans - it’s the classic kind of allegation which runs and runs - one fan to another to another - match-fixing is a subject which is always topical. 'Be in no doubt that to everyone who hears it - Mr Cairns’s entire career is tainted.' He told the judge: 'Preserving the integrity of any sport depends as much on vindicating the falsely accused as it does on convicting the guilty.' The hearing, which is estimated to last two weeks, continues.","Former New Zealand cricket captain Chris Cairns said Tweet 'turned his reputation to dust'

A new mother is fighting for her life after she was infected with a flesh-eating bacteria that sent her back to the hospital just 13 hours after she was released following the birth of her twins. The infection began as a small bruise on Lana Kuykendall's leg, though it began growing rapidly -- about one quarter of an inch an hour. The mother from Upstate, South Carolina, is now in critical condition at a hospital in Greenville. Torn away: Lana Kuykendall can't take care of her newborn twins because she is fighting for her life with a tube in her throat . Mrs Kuykendall, 36, is the second woman in the South to contract a rare bacterial infection called necrotizing fasciitis, which can spread rapidly as it kills flesh. Aimee Copeland, 24, a graduate student at the University of Georgia, has last one leg and the fingers on one of her hand after she was infected when she cut herself after falling from a homemade zip line. Her family fears she could lose an arm and the foot on her other leg, as well. Mrs Kuykendall is a trained paramedic, who knew something bad had happened when she spotted the spot on her leg and began experiencing pain that wouldn't go away, the Greenville News reported. She had been home from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where she gave birth to Ian and Abigail, for just 16 hours. Early detection: Mrs Kuykendall quickly recognized something was wrong because she is a paramedic. Her husband, Darren, is a firefighter . Critical condition: Within 90 minutes of arriving at the hospital, doctors rushed Mrs Kuykendall into surgery to removed the infected tissue . Her husband took her to the hospital and within 90 minutes, she was in emergency surgery. Doctors removed the dead, infected flesh on her leg in the hopes that they could stop the bacteria from spreading. Before she went into surgery, Mrs Kuykendall and her husband Darren watched in horror as the infection visibly spread throughout her leg. 'And the longer she sat there, the bigger that spot got. It was initially the size of a 3-by-5 index card. But it got bigger and bigger,' Mr Kuykendall, a firefighter, told the newspaper. 'It moved a quarter of an inch in half an hour. Then the high-risk OB physician had a suspicion of what it was.' Mrs Kuykendall is currently in the intensive care unit of Greenville Memorial Hospital, breathing through a tube. And she's missing out on some of the most important early days of her newborns' lives. '(We're) still in disbelief that here is my friend, who just had these two beautiful babies, and now she is intubated upstairs, and not able to enjoy the bonding experience, and enjoy the babies,' her friend Kayla Moon told MSNBC.","Lana Kuykendall's infection grew one quarter of an inch in an hour .

Council bosses in Lancashire are in discussions with a forensic vet over plans to DNA-test dog faeces which could then be traced back to the canine culprits and their owners. The scheme has been used effectively in some European countries and the USA and is seen as a possible option to help tackle the growing problem of dog-fouling in the south Lancashire borough of Hyndburn. Man's best friend? Dog fouling has become such a problem in Hyndburn in Lancashire that the council wants to set up a DNA database so that canine culprits can be traced . Last year Hyndburn council voted to call on the Government to increase the maximum fixed penalty notices for dog fouling from £75 to £1,000. Councillor Ken Moss, who proposed the scheme, said he was then contacted by the vet after reading about the story but insisted talks are still at an ‘early stage’. If given the go-ahead, it would be one of the first schemes of its kind in the country. Cllr Moss, who is chairman of the council’s overview and scrutiny committee, said: 'I am led to believe there are only two of these vets in Britain and they work by analysing the samples and identifying the dog by DNA. 'It’s something that has been used in . tourism hot spots on the continent and is something they are looking to . get a foot-hold of here in England. Green and pleasant land: The scheme has already been rolled out on the continent to preserve the beauty of favourite tourist spots . 'I will be talking to the vet to find . out how feasible that will be. I don’t know what it would cost. It . would probably rely on some database and we would need to find out if it . is feasible. 'It might be that it’s unrealistic and cost too much or rely too much on voluntary information from the public. 'We have only had preliminary talks and nothing has been signed and sealed.' Similar schemes in the USA and Germany have relied on a DNA database with either fur or saliva samples being taken from dogs in a local area. Any dog faeces found in public places are then tested and cross-checked against the DNA database to identify the offenders. Harvey Locke, former president of the British Veterinary Association and a practising vet, said current UK legislation would make it difficult to introduce a dog DNA database. Bag it, bin it or take it home: Hyndburn council wants to be able to fine dog-owners who let their dogs foul in public places up to £1,000 . He said: “It is possible to identify dogs from a faeces sample but you need to have a database with all the dogs in the area to identify a particular dog. 'It sounds fine in principle but there are questions about where the database would be held and who would fund it. 'If somebody has seen a dog fouling and wants to report a particular dog you would need to take a sample and that would require the owner’s consent. I am not aware of any legal framework that would allow this to happen.' The proposals are the latest in a series of measures being taken by the council to help tackle the amount of dog mess littering the streets. PCSOs are being urged to issue dog fouling fines and extra dog warden patrols have been arranged. A Cabinet Action Day was also held in December in the nearby picturesque village of Rishton, during which thousands of dog waste bags were handed out around the village.",The scheme is already used in some European countries and in the USA .

It’s one of those, “I wish I didn’t see it.” Seriously, I wish I didn’t witness anything,’ neighbour Del Evano told abc7.com. Though the Los Angeles Police Department’s Abused Child Unit is investigating Miriah’s death, they are treating it as a ‘death investigation,’ rather than a ‘homicide investigation.’ It is believed that Miriah was playing in the bedroom and accidentally hung herself in the short time she was unsupervised, and her death was a tragic accident. Her family assumed she was playing in another part of the house, but went looking for her after they hadn’t seen or heard her in some time.

The incidents date back to 1994, when the assistant principal at Chelsea Career and Technical High School warned him not to touch female students and was later caught remarking on the size of girls’ breasts. Now the Education Department is hoping to finally get rid of . him. According to investigators, he’s been accused of hugging . students, of sliding a hand down a girl’s back and saying her thighs were . getting smaller, of tickling the waist of an 11-year-old; palming a girl’s legs . and calling her ‘Tiny’, and of touching another student’s buttocks.

Three drunken brothers who pushed a celebrity bishop’s nephew into the path of a double-decker bus when he intervened to stop them bullying a man were each jailed for eight years today. Alex, Ross and Nicholas Lovett repeatedly stamped on Andrew Cross’s head and body, knocking him unconscious as the vehicle trapped him and crushed his leg. The 33-year-old victim’s uncle is Bishop Jonathan Blake, who blessed the marriage of the late Jade Goody to Jack Tweed and has appeared widely on television. Jailed: Nicholas Lovett, left, and Ross Lovett, right, pushed Andrew Cross into the path of a double-decker bus and stamped on him while he was trapped. Together with their brother Alex, they were sent to prison today . The holyman watched the Inner London Crown Court trial and sentencing with his martial artist nephew Mr Cross from the public gallery. Mr Cross suffered a deep gash on his leg which was left unstitched for 48 hours, and a full-thickness rip through his lip which exposed his teeth. His shin has been left deformed having swelled to ‘three times the size’ of the other and he has been unable to enjoy his sport at the same level. The Lovetts had been out celebrating Ross’s birthday with their wives when they first set upon Mr Cross in the door of the packed Excel Cabs, in Bexleyheath, Kent, on March 6 last year. The victims were waiting in line to go home after leaving a nightclub when they noticed Alex had an unknown man by the neck against a wall. Mr Cross split them up and the clash subsided, but as he walked outside Alex headbutted and pushed him. Horrific: This image shows Andrew Cross in hospital after being attacked by the three drunken brothers. The friend who was with him when he was attacked feared he might die . Ross, 32, a doorman who has a previous caution for headbutting a man in a pub, then started on Mr Cross' friend Martin Workman. He headbutted him and attempted to gouge out his eye with his fingers. Mr Cross landed punches on 38-year-old Alex’s face leaving him with a broken nose and eye socket. Jurors watched chilling CCTV footage captured on the bus of Mr Cross trying to get away from his attackers and swinging his arms as he is surrounded and hit by the vehicle. Mr Cross’s ‘roar’ could be heard over the road in the Golden Lion pub. Fortunately the driver had seen the commotion and slowed down so he just managed to stop before he completely ran over Mr Cross. The wheel instead crushed his leg and trapped him by his trousers. Jonathan Turner, prosecuting, said: ‘He gets trapped under that bus and his jeans get caught up in the wheel. ‘He is covered in blood.’ The prosecutor said while he was unable to break free, the brothers were stamping on the victim’s head around 10 times and Nicholas, 40, bit him on his arm. Mr Workman said in one strike, one of the brothers ‘penalty-kicked Andy’ in the back of his head causing his eyes to roll as he lost consciousness. The friend managed to prevent a further ‘running kick’ connecting with Mr Cross’s skull, and laughing Ross then pinned Mr Workman against the bus. Mr Workman, a fireman and also a . Wing Chun martial arts instructor, suffered a fractured hand during the incident when he . tried to stop blows landing on his friend’s skull. Scene of attack: The Lovetts had been out celebrating Ross' birthday with their wives when they first set upon Andrew Cross in the door of the packed Excel Cabs, in Bexleyheath, Kent, pictured . Mr Cross was taken to nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital for treatment with Mr Workman fearing he would die. The deep wound swelled up so much it was . not stitched for 48 hours to relieve the pressure, and he also suffered . ligament damage in his other leg from trying to kick himself free. The court heard Alex, a father-of-two and manager at an electrical company with no previous convictions, had been going through a ‘difficult divorce’ at the time. He closed his eyes as he heard his fate and weeping could be heard coming from the public gallery. Celebrity: Andrew Cross is the nephew of Bishop Jonathan Clive Blake, pictured. He blessed the marriage of the late Jade Goody to Jack Tweed and has appeared widely on television . Judge Patricia Lees said: ‘I do take the view that Mr Cross is lucky to be alive. ‘This could have resulted in serious brain injury, no thanks to the three in the dock, because it was plainly their intention to inflict really serious harm. ‘You don’t throw someone into the path of a bus without expecting that. ‘The three of them were standing in the doorway of the cab office intimidating people. ‘No-one was to get the better of them. ‘Anything done by Mr Cross was in response to a sustained and vicious assault. ‘Mr Cross decided, even though he had been headbutted, just to go, but he wasn’t allowed to do that. ‘The CCTV footage was chilling. ‘The attack involved persistence to a truly shocking degree.’ Judge Lees commended many of the witnesses for their efforts to help and she said the careful actions of some prevented Mr Workman from losing his leg. Alex Lovett, of Billingshurst, West Sussex, who the judge said was the leader, admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and affray. The two other brothers, both married fathers of three, Ross Lovett, Dartford, Kent, and Nicholas Lovett, of Greenhithe, Kent, who has no previous convictions, denied the same charges and were convicted following trial. Ross was further convicted of assaulting Mr Workman occasioning him actual bodily harm.","Trio repeatedly stamped on Andrew Cross’ head and body which knocked him unconscious as the bus trapped him and crushed his leg .

Revelations: Details of an affair between Alison Levitt, QC, pictured, and a Lib Dem peer were covered in the press . Any claims charges against Rebekah Brooks over the phone hacking scandal may have been motivated by a tabloid expose of a key prosecuting lawyer’s affair with a peer have been rubbished as ‘preposterous’. Director of Prosecutions Keir Starmer, QC, mounted a fierce defence of his principal advisor Alison Levitt, QC, amid suggestion she is not impartial because of her experiences at the hands of the press. In 2007, married Ms Levitt - now in charge of overseeing CPS decision making and all potential prosecutions - embarked on a five-month affair with the then Government’s anti-terror adviser Lord Carlile of Berriew. The barrister’s relationship with the peer 15 years her senior made national headlines after it was revealed by the Mail on Sunday. According to the Telegraph it is understood lawyers for the former News of the World and Sun editor are weighing up whether to use the revelations to seek a judicial review, claiming Ms Levitt has a ‘jaundiced view of the tabloid press’. But the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, slammed any suggestions of a conflict of interest over the decision to bring charges of perverting justice. He said: ‘It is preposterous to question the judgement of my Principal Legal Advisor, Alison Levitt QC, on the basis that five years ago the News of the World wrote three sentences about her private life, repeating what had been reported elsewhere and which had been, in any event, common knowledge for a year. Headlines: Liberal Democrat Peer Alex Carlisle, right, had a five-month affair with married Alison Levitt before confessing his adultery to loyal wife Frances, left . ‘Alison Levitt QC was not even aware that the News of the World had written anything about her until it was drawn to her attention yesterday. She is a distinguished and highly respected QC.’ Her legal team is said to be looking into whether Ms Levitt alone took the decision to bring charges – in which case a challenge may be more likely – or sought external legal advice. Mrs Brooks reacted with fury to the announcement, on Tuesday, she - along with five others including her husband Charlie Brooks - would be charged with perverting justice, branding it a ‘witch-hunt’. In an extraordinary outburst, former News International chief executive, said it was an ‘expensive sideshow and a waste of public money’. Standing by her side, Mr Brooks – an Old Etonian friend of David Cameron – said that he and four other suspects also charged with attempting to hide evidence from police had been made ‘scapegoats’. Fury: Rebekah Brooks, right, reacted with anger to prosecutors' decision to charge her and husband Charlie Brooks, left, with perverting justice, branding it a 'witch-hunt' Earlier in the day the Crown Prosecution Service had taken the unusual step of summoning the cameras to announce the charges live on television. Miss Levitt, who became a barrister at the age of 23, told assembled journalists: ‘This statement is made in the interests of transparency and accountability to explain the decisions reached in respect of allegations that Rebekah Brooks conspired with her husband, Charles Brooks, and others to pervert the course of justice. ‘The Crown Prosecution Service received a file of evidence from the Metropolitan Police Service on 27th March 2012 in relation to seven suspects: . ‘All the evidence has now carefully been considered. ‘Applying the two-stage test in the Code for Crown Prosecutors I have concluded that in relation to all suspects except the seventh, there is sufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction. ‘I then considered the second stage of the test, and I have concluded that a prosecution is required in the public interest in relation to each of the other six. She added: ‘All these matters relate to the ongoing police investigation into allegations of phone hacking and corruption of public officials in relation to the News of the World and The Sun newspapers. But the QC also stressed: ‘May I remind all concerned that these six individuals now will be charged with criminal offences and that each has a right to a fair trial. It is very important that nothing is said, or reported, which could prejudice that trial. For these reasons it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.’","Affair between Alison Levitt, QC, and a Lib Dem peer made national headlines in 2007 .

Spring has sprung across America this week, but so has allergy season - and it's packing a furious punch. The unusually warm winter has led to an earlier than expected allergy season which has hit with a wheezing vengeance in parts of the South and Midwest this year. Abundant pollen is causing watery eyes, sniffles and sneezing. Doctors say that the spring misery stretches from Mississippi to Ohio and from Georgia to Texas, where drought conditions have exacerbated the problem. Pollen problem: With pollen levels reaching incredible highs, many cars in Atlanta, Georgia, have been rolling up to local car washes looking like this . Growth: In New York's Central Park, an unseasonably warm winter has given way to spring blooms and record pollen counts three weeks early in 2012 . As record breaking temperatures were recorded today in parts of the Midwest and New York, forecasters and allergists blame the unseasonably warm weather, and few cold snaps, for causing plants to bloom weeks early and release the allergy-causing particles. In some areas, allergists say pollen counts this week are as high as they've ever recorded. Dr Joseph Leija, who's responsible for the Midwest's official daily allergy count at Gottlieb Memorial Hospital in Melrose Park, Illinois, said in a statement that the tree pollen in the area indicates a dangerous air quality warning. In Chicago, the tree pollen count of 1,600 grains of pollen per cubic meter recorded two days ago is 100 grains of pollen more than what's considered 'dangerous' levels . Warning: Dr Joseph Leija, who's manages the Midwest's daily allergy count says tree pollen in the area shows dangerous air quality . Dr Leija said: 'The warm March temperatures and sunny skies have encouraged the early budding of trees and flowers and my phones at Gottlieb are ringing with sufferers seeking relief'. A clinic at Vanderbilt University in Nashville recorded 11,000 grains of pollen per cubic meter Tuesday, the worst in the 12 years they've tracked the number. The Atlanta Allergy & Asthma Clinic has measured pollen since the 1980s and says this week's counts have beaten a high mark recorded there in April 1999. Their count for Tuesday was almost 9,400. Fifteen-hundred is considered very high. The medical director of the Vanderbilt Asthma, Sinus and Allergy Program says he's been seeing more patients - even while feeling puny himself. 'I'm kind of sniffly today,' Dr David Hagaman said Tuesday. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of . America says more than 40 million Americans have nasal allergies, . popularly called hay fever. In severe cases, sufferers have difficulty . breathing that can send them to the emergency room. Stephanie Baxter was walloped when she returned to Gallatin, Tennessee, from a vacation in Florida last week. Pollen, at a glance: This U.S. map shows the forecasted levels of pollen throughout the country, with the South registering the highest . Allergy fears: Pollen has covered parked cars like this one in areas of the South, after the unusually warm winter, where the pollen levels are soaring . 'We hit Tennessee and they started,' she said. 'I have every possible symptom you can have. I'm trying to keep my energy because I have a 3-month-old and a 3-year-old. There's no time for rest'. For three years, the foundation has ranked Knoxville, Tennessee, as the worst city in the country for allergies - based on pollen counts, sales of allergy medications and the presence allergy specialists. The city has been up to 20 degrees warmer than normal the past few weeks. Spring arrived prematurely - along with sales of nose spray. Weekend warriors: This graph shows the pollen forecast in Atlanta Georgia, with amounts spiking by Sunday . 'It's blooming so early,' said Sam Roberts, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Morristown, Tenn. 'Grass mowing has started early this year and stirred things up.' Ranee Randby, community relations director for the Knox County Health Department, said Knoxville's scenic location in the Tennessee valley contributes to the problem. 'We're surrounded by mountains and . whatever gets in here stays in here. It's like a bowl,' she said. 'It's a . beautiful, green part of the country but pollen comes with that'. (Source: Weather.com) In San Antonio, Texas, patients with allergies have increased in the past few weeks at Southwest General Hospital. Daniel St. Armand, the emergency room director, doesn't have to leave the hospital to find someone suffering. 'I have a friend who goes through this yearly and it affects his whole system,' he said. 'He constantly has a runny nose and itchy skin and eyes. He's just not himself'. In Atlanta, Andre Osborne returned home from a long weekend to find his black Infiniti sedan caked in yellow pollen. 'I feel terrible,' he said. 'I know it's not as bad as it can be. But the sneezing, the uncontrollable coughing, it's starting to kick in'. A couple miles away, business was up at Cactus Car Wash as drivers brought in their pollen-covered cars. Yellow water streamed into drains in its parking lot. 'It's very unusual this early on,' said manager Jim James. 'It's getting cars a lot dirtier, which is happier for us.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 00:50 EST, 23 May 2012 . Broadway heir Eric Nederlander racked up his third arrest relating to a threatening altercation with his on-off girlfriend. Nederlander, 46, spent a night in a Manhattan jail after allegedly stealing Nancy Okun's keys and trying to break into her apartment in a jealous rage. 'You f***ing b****! You're cheating on me!' he screamed as he tried to break into Ms Okun's West Village apartment around 1am on Thursday morning. Violation: Nederlander accused Nancy Okun (left) of cheating on him and proceeded to yank her hair agressively . This latest incident is the third time that she has called the police on Nederlander in the past year. The first came in July of last year, when he allegedly slammed her head into the Plexiglass divider of a taxi during an argument and followed her up to her Greenwich Village apartment, outside of which he proceeded to punch and shoved her. Scion: Eric Nederlander was arrested for violating a protection order when he allegedly pulled his girlfriend's hair . Because Ms Okun, who had been dating Nederlander 'for years' at the time of the July 19 incident, decided not to prosecute, Nederlander was able to plead down to disorderly conduct and had to complete 26 weeks of anger management classes. The classes apparently did not take, as he reportedly went on to aggressively pull her hair while she was sleeping. That January incident violated the limited order of protection that was filed after the first altercation. The order allowed the couple to still live together but said that he was forbidden from assaulting or harassing Ms Okun. There are marked similarities between the January incident and the latest arrest, since he yelled 'You're cheating on me!' while he pulled her hair. The New York Post reports that the most recent altercation happened when Ms Okun woke up around 1am and found that Nederlander was no longer in her apartment and had stolen her spare set of keys. About two hours later, he tried to open the door using the spare keys, and then used his body to attempt to push past two deadbolts. The police complaint states that he 'attempted to push open the door through the two deadbolt locks on the door by applying his body weight to the door.' Wife number two: Nederlander and his second wife Lindsey Kupferman- who looks rather similar to Ms Okun- have a daughter together named Mira and Nederlander feared the latest incident would result in custody issues . First marriage: Nederlander was famously married to Jessica Sklar for just three weeks. She left him for comedian Jerry Seinfeld after they met at the gym . Nederlander, who comes from a wealthy theater family and was briefly married to Jessica Sklar before she met and married comedian Jerry Seinfeld, has had run ins with the law in the past before he began dating Ms Okun. His second wife, Lindsey Kupferman, got a restraining order against him when she divorced him just seven weeks after giving birth to their daughter Mira. At the time, Nederlander blamed his behavior on male postpartum depression. He and Kupferman are still battling it out in court over custody of their daughter.","Girlfriend Nancy Okun has called the cops two other times on Eric Nederlander but judge allowed him to still live with her .

According to the papers the teenager, who cannot be named  for legal reasons, also told friends that he was going to murder someone on the night of the killing, but they thought he was joking. Victim David Auchterlonie, the teenager and two other friends drove to Belanglo Forest, south-west of Sydney, on a night in November last year. It was David's birthday. He had just turned 17. Belanglo Forest is where Milat dumped the bodies of his seven backpacking victims between 1989 and 1992. Two of them were British girls. According to the papers before Campbelltown Children's Court, David's brutal cold-blooded murder and about 15 minutes of dialogue were captured on a video recording on one of the teenager's mobile phones. Victims: Ivan Milat killed seven people - including Joanne Walters, bottom left, and Caroline Clarke, third from left on bottom, and dumped their bodies in Belanglo forest between 1989 and 1992 . The video shows the victim rolling a marijuana . cigarette in the front seat when the teenager, who is standing by the . boot, calls out to him. David gets out of the car and a double-edged axe . is swung into his torso. Ivan Milat, who came to be known as the Backpacker Murderer, was Australia's worst serial killer. Among his victims were Britons Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters, both 22. They were kidnapped, . shot and stabbed to death by Milat after he picked them up while they . were hitchhiking in 1992. Their bodies were found in the Belanglo Forest, 80 miles south-west of Sydney, in September that year. Miss Clarke, from Northumberland, had been shot several times in the head while Miss Walters, from  south Wales, had been stabbed nine times. Despite a search of the forest over following days no other bodies were found, but a year later a local man discovered a skull. Police returned to the forest and found five more bodies of backpackers who had been murdered in previous years. Milat, who is now 66, was arrested after British backpacker Paul Onions managed to escape and give police details of his attacker. As well as his two British victims, Milat killed a German backpacking couple, a German woman who was hitchhiking alone, and two young travellers from Melbourne. He is serving seven life sentences. The teenager says to him: 'From what I've heard, you're the one . who's going around telling people about the money that I stole from my . mum's house.' 'I swear to God, I haven't,' David replies. The accused says: 'Shut the f**k up' before directing David to lie on the ground face down and to stay still. For a further ten minutes, he threatens the victim and urges him to confess to spreading rumours. 'You move, I chop your head off, ' he says. According to court documents, the phone then records the sound of an axe hitting the victim. The police statement said: 'Whilst the victim was lying with his head on the ground, the accused swung back the axe and hit the deceased in the back of the head, where the axe remained lodged in the deceased's skull. 'The deceased died instantly, and the sound of the air leaving his body is also captured on the recording.' The documents state that the teenager pulled the axe out of David's head by dragging him across the road. He and another boy then covered the body with branches before all three left the forest in the vehicle. The accused teenager, who appeared via audio-visual link, showed no emotion as his lawyer entered his guilty plea. He will be sentenced in the Supreme Court in Sydney on December 2. Relatives of David Auchterlonie have called for a life sentence with the order 'never to be released'.

A dramatic film about the assassination of Osama Bin Laden could be controversially released before the U.S presidential elections in November, it has emerged. Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein - a supporter of the Democratic Party - is in negotiations to buy Code Name Geronimo at the Cannes Film Festival. It is believed the film producer will release the film in late September or October - which is likely to infuriate President Obama's Republican opponents. Supporter: Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein left, is in negotiations to buy Code Name Geronimo. Opponents of President Barack Obama, right, will be concerned that it could boost his ratings ahead of the presidential elections in November . Sony Pictures has already decided not to release the film Zero Dark Thirty - also about the assassination of the Al Qaeda leader - until December. Its release date of December 19 was set after the scheduled release date for October drew criticism of the Republican party. It was feared the film would bolster Obama's re-election prospects and those concerns are likely to be raised again with Code Name Geronimo. Footage from the film was shown for the first time in Cannes on Wednesday. It is directed by John Stockwell. The film tells the story of the manhunt for Osama Bin Laden and the efforts of the Navy Seals. It is in the final stages of production and its asking price is rumoured to be $2million. Blockbuster: Code Name Geronimo tells the story of the manhunt for Osama Bin Laden, pictured, and the efforts of the Navy Seals . Sony has said it has no plans of moving its release date for Zero Dark Thirty, which is directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who famously directed Oscar-winning film The Hurt Locker. Mr Weinstein previously released the anti-Bush documentary by Michael Moore 'Fahrenheit 9/11' shortly before the elections in 2004. Osama Bin Laden was killed in May last year when U.S. Navy Seals raided the building in Abbottabad , Pakistan, that the terrorist mastermind had lived in for five years. The raid was completed shortly after 1 am local time when bin Laden was shot once in the chest and once in the head by a U.S Navy Seal who announced 'For God and country Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo', because Geronimo was the code-name given to the Al Qaeda leader. Found: The hideout of the Al-Qaeda leader is pictured. He was killed in May last year when U.S. Navy Seals raided the building in Abbottabad, Pakistan . President Obama himself said in the White House Situation Room watching events unfold, 'We got him.' Before the U.S Navy Seals left the compound they destroyed one of the two top secret stealth helicopters that had delivered them to the house after it encountered difficulties on landing and therefore could not take off again. Intelligence recovered from the home made public in the aftermath of his death showed Osama bin Laden wrapped up from the cold watching news coverage of himself. In February 2012, Pakistani security agencies demolished the building to stop it becoming a shrine to the deceased Al Qaeda supremo.","Hollywood heavyweight (and Democrat supporter) to bring out Code Name Geronimo before Zero Dark Thirty .

Behind bars: David Simpson could face the death penalty if convicted of murder after finding 18 mutilated bodies in the Central African Republic . David Cameron has intervened in the case of the British pilot accused of mass murder in the Central African Republic. Safari firm worker David Simpson, 24, of Pickering, North Yorkshire, discovered 13 corpses in a jungle two months ago. He reported the finding but two days later was arrested on suspicion of murder and has been held in a squalid prison in the capital Bangui ever since. The Prime Minister has discussed the case with one of the country's closest allies, Gabon's President Ali Bongo Ondimba. It is claimed President Bongo has now sent an envoy to make representations on Mr Simpson's behalf. A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed: 'The case was raised in the meeting that the Prime Minister and [Minister for Africa] Henry Bellingham had with President Bongo during his visit to the UK last week.' Charity Human Rights Watch believe that the supporters of notorious warlord Joseph Kony carried out the killings. Mr Simpson, who was working for the safari firm Cawa, now faces up to six more months in jail as a judge carries out a review of the case. Mr Simpson's family have received hate mail from animal rights campaigners saying that they hope he is ‘raped and murdered’. The manager for a big game hunter has been been charged with mass murder - which he denies - following his gruesome discovery of the mutilated bodies of the gold mine workers. Murder still carries the death penalty in the impoverished country, although the last execution was in 1981. Since his arrest, anonymous letters have been sent to his family’s pheasant farm in Yorkshire, saying they hope Mr Simpson ‘rots in hell’ for his work with the game company, which offers wealthy clients the chance to shoot lions, leopard and buffalo. One of the letters, posted by his brother Paul, 22, on a Facebook page dedicated to securing his release, reads: ‘I hope he rots in hell and then gets hacked to pieces.’ Framed?: Mr Simpson worked for a big game hunting company and may have been set-up. Since he has been arrested his family have received vile hate mail . The author adds: ‘I just hope not too much of my tax money is spent on consular assistance.’ Paul said: ‘One of the letters was addressed to my mother. ‘It’s shocking because why should David’s life matter less than that of an animal? ‘I do not understand where that kind of hatred comes from. The things they were saying were just awful, that they hoped David was raped and murdered whilst in prison.’ Talks: David Cameron has raised the case of David Simpson with the Gabon president . The letters, posted from Sheffield and Lancashire, are now being investigated by police. Mr Simpson’s family had initially hoped he would be freed within weeks, but despite meeting with the Foreign Office on Monday to try and negotiate terms for his release, they do not know how long it will be. His father Peter has also posted on the Facebook page that they have been told he will be released under house arrest this week, although he added: . ‘They have been saying this for a month now.’ Mr Simpson’s family say they are also becoming increasingly concerned at alleged corruption within the CAR, which has been widely condemned for its appalling human rights record. Their fears have been raised after a CAR newspaper apparently reported that a witness had seen Mr Simpson and Mr Mararv taking part in the massacre. Ugandan rebel army chief Kony, the leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity including the abduction of thousands of children he has forced to be soldiers or sex slaves. His troops have already committed hundreds of atrocities. Kony is thought to be in hiding in the CAR. He recently made international headlines after a video of his terrible crimes went viral. It was viewed more than 90 million times and endorsed by celebrities including Angelina Jolie. Mr Simpson moved to Africa two years ago for the chance of an exciting new life away from his rural village of Gillamoor, North Yorkshire. He says he was helping to clear a road with some colleagues through a dense bush in the south of his firm’s vast hunting reserve on March 23 when they found the mutilated bodies of dead workers near a hand-panning gold mine. The men had been tied together in groups of four and murdered by having boiling water poured over them, cut with machetes and beaten with sticks. Suspects: It is widely believed supporters of the notorious warlord Joseph Kony carried out the killings . He told the Mail: ‘It was a terrible thing to see. They were murdered in such a methodical and brutal way, tied together in groups, face down and in circles with their heads together.’ His company Cawa offers clients the chance to hunt wild game animals at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds, with the cost of shooting a lion being around £20,000. Since his arrest, his younger brother Paul, who lives with his parents, Peter, 54, and Vicky, 53, on their farm, has been campaigning for his brother’s release. He said: ‘It is incredible that my brother is being accused of this. It is all about money. ‘We are all very worried about. I just hope the police come to their senses and release him.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘The Government is taking this case extremely seriously and has pressed the CAR authorities for assurances that due legal process will be followed. We have asked that the matter will be concluded as swiftly as possible.’","PM discusses case with Gabon president Ali Bongo Ondimba .

Prototype: Designed to rival the Mini and Fiat 500, Vauxhall's Adam hatchback will make its public debut at the Paris Motor Show in September . While the car's straightforward name will leave many British drivers bemused, the moniker will have more of a resonance with German motorists. Vauxhall cars are branded as Opel on the continent, a company founded by Adam Opel. General Motors, which owns Vauxhall, calls its German business Adam Opel AG so the name of its new compact car will resonate with local drivers. Back in Britain, meanwhile, the name is almost certain to be met with a snigger. Adam, which is due to go on sale in early 2013, is a four-seat vehicle that is approximately 3.7m long - roughly the same length as a Mini hatchback. The 'muscular and stylish' car is expected to have a starting price of £10,000 so will be similar in cost to the Fiat 500. It will have a newly-developed 1.0-litre, three-cylinder engine and is due to be fully-customisable.

The stubby arms of Tyrannosaurus Rex clearly weren't its most fearsome feature - but its cousins were even weedier. When Tyrannosaurus and its relatives roamed North America and Asia, the abelisaurids occupied a similar niche in Patagoniaand other areas of Gondwanaland - areas of south America. They had huge jaws - like T-Rex, they relied on them to crush and kill prey, but had even tinier arms than the tyrannosaurs. When Tyrannosaurus and its relatives roamed North America and Asia, the abelisaurids occupied a similar niche in Patagoniaand other areas of Gondwanaland - areas of south America . They were the dominant predators in the Southern hemisphere and resembled the tyrannosaurids in their general appearance, but their unusually short and high skulls were unique. In one respect, however, their northern counterparts could claim to be better equipped. Though they were pretty stubby, the arms of Tyrannosaurus rex were much more impressive than the puny forelimbs of the abelisaurids. Fossil material from Patagonia representing a new abelisaurid species has now thrown light on their early evolution. The specimen is of Jurassic age and 40 million years older than any other known abelisaurid - and it reveals that arm reduction must have begun at an early stage in the group's evolutionary history. LMU paleontologist Dr. Oliver Rauhut,who is also affiliated with the Bavarian State Collections for Palaeontology and Geology in Munich and his Argentinian colleague Dr. Diego Pol have now discovered when the trend toward reduction of the upper extremities began in the abelisaurids. ‘Abelisaurids were a highly diverse and widely distributed group during the Cretaceous,’ saysRauhut, ‘but their origins have so far remained enigmatic.’ The specimen is of Jurassic age and 40 million years older than any other known abelisaurid - and it reveals that arm reduction must have begun at an early stage in the group's evolutionary history . Rauhut and Pol have named the new species Eoabelisaurus mefi, or ‘dawn Abelisaurus of the Museo Palentológico Egidio Feruglio (MEF)’, in recognition of the Museum's support for their research collaboration. ‘The new find reveals that the abelisaurid lineage is more ancient than we thought,’ says Rauhut. ‘The reason why so little is known about it is that the fossil record of predatory dinosaurs in the Southern hemisphere is very incomplete, especially for the period from the Middle Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous.’ The researchers were also surprised to find that Eoabelisaurus had evolved on the supercontinent Pangea before it fragmented into the landmasses we know today, and yet abelisaurids were not distributed globally. ‘One possible explanation is that a huge desert in Central Pangea prevented dispersal of the group to the North, confining the evolution of the lineage to the Southern hemisphere,’ says Pol. Recent geological studies, together with the results of climate modeling, support the existence of such a geographical barrier. ‘The trend apparently set in early on, and began at the distal end,’ says Rauhut. In Eoabelisaurus, the upper arm is of normal size, but the lower arm is much shorter in comparison; the hand is very stunted and the fingers and claws are tiny.’ US paleontologists had recently suggested that reduction in abelisaurids began with the hand, and the new data seem to confirm this. ’Our picture of dinosaur evolution in the Jurassic is largely based on fossils from Northern sites,’ says Rauhut. ‘The Southern hemisphere surely still has many surprises in store for us.’","'Abelisaurids' had ferocious bite but even tinier arms .

Facing extradition: A judge has ruled Dorothee Burkhart, the mother of a serial arson suspect, can be extradited from the US to her native Germany to face numerous fraud charges including the claim she failed to pay for breast augmentation . A judge has ruled the mother of a suspected serial arsonist can be extradited from the United States to face numerous fraud charges  including the claim she failed to pay for breast augmentation. Dorothee Burkhart, 53, is also accused in her native Germany of failing to return security deposits on rental properties she leased and accepting fees and deposits on apartments she did not own. Her 24-year-old son, Harry Burkhart, has been charged with 100 arson-related counts involving 49 fires in Hollywood, West Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley. Ms Burkhart appears to own an erotic massage business and has been linked to websites offering the services of 'Goddess Annabelle' in the Hollywood area. The sites describe their owner as a 'sexologist', but emphasise that her massages are not to be confused with prostitution. She was taken into custody on an arrest warrant issued by German authorities in late December - right before dozens of fires, mostly started in parked cars, left Los Angeles residents on edge and caused an estimated $3 million in damage. The fires raged from December 30 to January 2. Harry Burkhart pleaded innocent in January to arson and related charges and is being held on $7.5 million bail. An arson investigator said in court papers that the younger Burkhart was motivated by 'rage against Americans' and wanted to terrorise as many residents of Los Angeles as possible. Harry Burkhart was arrested after a tip-off from a member of the US State Department's Diplomatic Security field office who recognized him on surveillance videotape from his mother's initial court hearing in December. According to court papers, Harry Burkhart was ejected from the courtroom after shouting a profanity against Americans. Serial arson suspect: Harry Burkhart was arrested at a time when his mother Dorothee faces extradition over fraud charges . In ordering Dorothee Burkhart's extradition, the magistrate judge rejected an argument by her attorneys that she was a key material witness in her son's case, and that she could be tortured or killed in Germany. Judge Charles F. Eick wrote in the document: 'Ms Burkhart's allegations that she would be inhumanely treated, tortured or killed if extradited to Germany are simply not credible.' State prosecutors in Germany said Harry Burkhart was also wanted in that country on suspicion of starting a fire that burned down his family's home in Neukirchen. Judge Eick denied an application by Harry Burkhart to intervene in his mother's extradition as well as her motion to stay the proceeding. Ms Burkhart argued that she needed to help her son's defense. US attorney's spokesman Thom Mrozek said that though Eick's ruling is final, Dorothee Burkhart can choose to file a habeus corpus petition, which would be tantamount to an appeal. If the decision is not appealed, it will be forwarded to the Secretary of State, who will have 60 days to review the matter and decide whether she will be extradited to Germany.

Some former insiders say he's imposing even more rigid requirements on church members. A number of marriages have been dissolved and families split up as Jeffs works from his prison cell to reshape his Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, according to Willie Jessop, a former FLDS spokesman. Power: Convicted paedophile Warren Jeffs has been reportedly purging people from his Church from inside prison and imposing stricter rules on them . Since about mid-November, Jeffs' brother, Lyle Jeffs, has been conducting personal interviews with . members to determine their worthiness under the stringent new orders. The inquiries range from whether . members are saying daily prayers to whether they have carnal desires or . 'dwell in the wickedness of evil dross of this generation.' Jeffs recently lost his phone . privileges at his prison in East Texas after it was discovered he . preached to his followers from behind bars on Christmas Day, in . violation of prison rules. He is currently serving a life sentence  for sexually assaulting two girls he wed as spiritual brides when they were 12 and 14 years old at his sect's Texas ranch. Allegations surfaced earlier this . month that underage girls are still secretly being held by Jeffs' followers for sexual purposes.

"By . Paul Revoir . PUBLISHED: . 18:59 EST, 28 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:59 EST, 28 May 2012 . In the running: Ed Richards confirmed his candidacy for the BBC job after months of speculation . Ofcom boss Ed Richards has applied to be the next director general of the BBC and has already stepped aside from any work related to the broadcaster, it was confirmed yesterday. The head of the UK media regulator issued a statement confirming his candidacy after months of speculation that he wanted to take over from Mark Thompson, who is stepping down after the Olympics. The confirmation from the regulator came after a report at the weekend which saw two senior MPs raising concerns about a potential conflict of interest caused by his bid for the new job. It was pointed out that over the past six months he has been overseeing an inquiry at Ofcom which is looking at whether the BBC should be included in a new way of defining media ‘plurality’. This could see Ofcom considering whether the BBC’s share of the market should be limited in a similar way that private companies in the media are. A statement put out by the regulator yesterday admitted he had applied for the role, but claimed ‘robust procedures’ had been put in place to ‘prevent any potential conflict of interest’. It said Mr Richards had already ‘stepped aside’ from any matters where the BBC might have an interest, this is said to include board meetings, executive meetings and policy discussions ‘both formal and informal’. Odds on Mr Richards have narrowed considerably in recent weeks and he is now regarded by many as the favourite for the job. However any appointment would be likely to be controversial given his Labour Party links and also because, as head of the media regulator, he is privy to sensitive information about commercial broadcasters such as ITV and Channel 4. He could be forced to take a lengthy period of gardening leave before he joined the BBC. Mark Thompson is stepping down as BBC Director General after the Olympics . Other names vying for the top job at the BBC are the corporation’s TV boss George Entwistle, its chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, BBC news chief Helen Boaden and director of audio and music Tim Davie. Mr Richards, whose total pay is just over £381,000, is currently in control of 750 staff, whereas at the BBC he would be in charge of about 20,000 people. But because of his salary he would not be put off by the fact that the new director general will be on considerably less than Mr Thompson’s most recent total pay figure was £671,000. Initial interviews are expected to take place in the next couple of weeks, before this is whittled down to three or four candidates who will go through final interviews after that. Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, will lead the team that make the final decision on the appointment. There are rumours that he would favour an external candidate, but Mr Richards remains the only confirmed candidate to come from outside the BBC. The Ofcom boss has been involved in UK media policy for many years. He served as Tony Blair’s policy advisor at Number 10 and was involved in the drafting of the Communications Act which created media regulator Ofcom before he joined the organisation as a senior partner. He became chief operating officer then and then replaced Lord Carter as chief executive in 2006. The media executive can boast experience of having worked for the BBC. He served there under former director general Lord Birt in the role of controller of corporate strategy. Ofcom’s statement yesterday read: ‘Given the significant level of speculation surrounding potential applicants for the BBC Director General role, Ofcom can confirm that CEO Ed Richards has applied. ‘Robust procedures, agreed by the Ofcom Chairman and the Board, have been put in place to prevent any potential conflict of interest. ‘Ed has already stepped aside from all discussions and communication at all levels on matters where the BBC may have an interest. This includes Board meetings, executive meetings and policy discussions, both formal and informal.’","Ed Richards confirms candidacy for director general position .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:24 EST, 27 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:25 EST, 27 May 2012 . The incident will test Afghan President Hamid Karzai's relationship with the West . A Nato airstrike has killed eight members of the same family, including six children, Afghan officals have claimed. The incident happened in the Paktia province, in the east of Afghanistan at around 8pm local time (5.30pm GMT), according to a spokesman for the area's provincial governor. It comes weeks after Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that civilian casualties could undermine a strategic partnership with the West. An anonymous Nato official disputed the claim, saying there was no evidence of any casualties. The airstrike happened just a day after four Nato soldiers, including a British man from the 1st Battalion, were killed in separate bomb attacks, the same day Labour leader Ed Miliband visited Afghanistan. Rohullah Samon, the spokesman for Patkia’s provincial governor, said civilian Mohammad Shafi was killed along with his wife and their six children in an airstrike in the village of Suri Khail in the Gurda Saria district. 'Shafi was not a Taliban. He was not in any opposition group against the government. He was a villager,' Mr Samon said. 'Right now, we are working on this case to find out the ages of their children and how many of them are boys and girls.' The attack happened the day after Afghan President Hamid Karzai met Labour leader Ed Miliband . Mr Karzai has sent a delegation to the village to investigate the incident. Nato spokesman Lt Col Jimmie Cummings said: 'We acknowledge that coalition forces were conducting an operation in Paktia province against a large number of insurgents and we are also aware of the media reports today of civilian casualty allegations in that area.' However, he did not confirm the reports. The killings of civilians by foreign forces has been a major irritant in president Karzai’s relationship with partners including America and Britain. Tensions rose earlier this year after Afghan officials reported that 18 civilians had died recently in four airstrikes in Logar, Kapisa, Badghis and Helmand provinces. Civilian deaths caused by coalition troops have become a tense issue in Afghanistan . 'If the lives of Afghan people are not safe, the signing of the strategic partnership has no meaning,' Karzai’s office said earlier this month. Last year was the deadliest on record for civilians in the Afghan war. 3,021 were killed as insurgents ratcheted up violence with suicide attacks and roadside bombs. The U.N. said over three quarters of civilian deaths were due to insurgent attacks, with just 14 percent as a result of actions by international and Afghan troops. One in ten cases had an unknown cause. Elsewhere, two civilians were killed Sunday when their vehicle struck a roadside bomb in Marjah district of Helmand province in the south, provincial spokesman Daud Ahmadi said.","Afghan official says father, mother and six children killed by attack in east of country earlier today .

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 22:14 EST, 30 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:15 EST, 30 May 2012 . U.S. authorities said a Pakistani doctor who helped the CIA track down Osama bin Laden . turned down an opportunity to leave his country and resettle overseas . with his family, according to U.S. officials. Dr. Shakil Afridi was jailed last week in Pakistan for 33 years for treason and President Obama's administration has come under steady criticism for its handling of his case. The unnamed U.S. officials said the resettlement offer for Afridi came around the time of the May 1, 2011, raid in which U.S. Navy SEAL commandos killed the al Qaeda leader at his complex in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Pakistani doctor Shakil Afridi talks with people outside a building at an unknown location in Pakistan, before his imprisonment this month at a tribal court . They indicated that . Afridi's family would have been welcome to leave Pakistan with him as . part of the resettlement plan. The officials said he rejected the offer . for reasons that are unclear. 'Before he was arrested, Doctor Afridi was offered opportunities to leave Pakistan with his family but he turned those down,' one of the U.S. officials said. 'Some may question . why he did this but no one, including the doctor, could have foreseen . that Pakistan would punish so severely someone whose work benefited the . country so much.' Dr. Shakil Afridi helped the CIA track down Osama bin Laden and turned down an opportunity to leave Pakistan and resettle overseas with his family . Dr. Afridi was ran a fake vaccination campaign in Abbottabad and used cheek swabs to try to gather DNA from bin Laden's children to confirm the identity of those living in the compound before the May 2011 raid. The DNA effort . ultimately did not succeed but U.S. sources have told Reuters he helped . American operatives locate and follow the bin Laden courier who led them . to the Abbottabad hideout. The offer for . Afridi to leave Pakistan was confirmed independently by two U.S. officials. The White House and State Department declined comment on the . matter. Afridi's case has . damaged U.S.-Pakistan relations with outraged U.S. senators voting last . week to cut aid to Pakistan by $33 million - $1 million for each year of . the doctor's prison sentence. U.S. officials said the resettlement offer for Afridi came about the time of the May 1, 2011, raid in which U.S. Navy SEAL commandos killed Osama bin-Laden . 'It's arbitrary, but the hope is that Pakistan will realise we are . serious,' said Senator Richard Durbin, the Senate's . second-highest-ranking Democrat. The US Secretary of State, Hillary . Clinton, added he disapproval and called the doctor's jailing 'unjust and unwarranted' and vowed . to press the case with Islamabad. Pakistan has said Washington should respect its court's decision. Pakistani authorities . arrested Afridi several weeks after the bin Laden raid. In the . intervening period, U.S. authorities believed they would have had ample . time to get him out of the country if he had wanted to leave. Mission: The Al Qaeda leader was killed at this compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Special Forces . Another official . said it was not usual for people in Afridi's situation to reject . resettlement offers . The official said Afridi may have believed that . rather than becoming the object of character attacks and accusations of . treason by Pakistani authorities, he might instead have won praise for . his role in helping rid Pakistan of a threat to its security and . stability. And in another twist . to a case that is straining Islamabad's ties with Washington, a . Pakistani court says the doctor who helped the United States find Osama . bin Laden was imprisoned for aiding militants and not for his links to . the CIA. It is the third different explanation for the 33-year jail sentence handed to Dr. Afridi. Last . week after his conviction by a court in the Khyber tribal region near . the Afghan border, Pakistani officials said the decision was based on . treason charges for aiding the CIA in its hunt for the al Qaeda chief. When that announcement rankled U.S. officials, Pakistan then said the doctor had a history of womanising. Tense: The moment President Barack Obama and his . team watched the mission to find bin Laden in the Situation Room of the . White House on May 1, 2011 . But . the judgment document made available to the media on Wednesday states . that Afridi was jailed because of his close ties to the banned militant . group Lashkar-e-Islam, which amounts to waging war against the state. It is unclear why Pakistani officials first said Afridi was jailed over his links to the CIA. One of the doctor's lawyers, Samiullah Afridi, was baffled after reading the verdict, which he also received on Wednesday. Both Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta have expressed their displeasure at Dr Shakil Afridi's imprisonment . 'These charges against him are very different from the ones we were told earlier,' said Samiullah. Afridi's brother . Jamil has described the treason charges as baseless and said the doctor . was being made a scapegoat. 'If my brother had . done something wrong, he had a valid U.S. visa. He could have fled the . country,' said Jamil after the sentence was handed down, adding that the . family had received no offers of help from the U.S. government . The compound, within which al Qaeda leader Osama . bin Laden was killed, is seen in flames after it was attacked in . Abbottabad in this still image taken from video footage from a mobile . phone May 2, 2011 . Osama bin Laden was killed after a meticulously planned U.S Navy SEAL raid on his Abbottabad home in Pakistan in May 2011 . In Washington, government sources said the United States is making strenuous efforts to win Afridi's release from jail. U.S. officials hail Afridi as a hero who helped the CIA track down bin . Laden, who was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs in a raid in the Pakistani town . of Abbottabad in May last year. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta suggested on Sunday that the jailing of Afridi would hurt efforts to repair relations. Many . Pakistanis were infuriated by the U.S. raid to get bin Laden in a town . just a two-hour drive from Islamabad and they see Afridi as a villain . who conspired against the state and brought unwanted scrutiny of . Pakistan's attitude to militants. Pakistani officials describe bin Laden's long . presence in the garrison town of Abbottabad as a security lapse and . reject suggestions that members of the military or intelligence services . were complicit in hiding him there.",Reports from Pakistan also suggest that Dr. Shakil Afridi was sentenced for links to Islamic militants and not for aiding U.S intelligence services .

Yet the British beach volleyball team managed just that yesterday as they played a game against the backdrop of the Houses of Parliament. Zara Dampney, who was joined by teammates Shauna Mullin, Denise Johns and Lucy Boulton, said it was ‘great fun’ to play in such an iconic location. And with the temperature climbing rapidly on one of the hottest days of the year, it was also just the right weather to show off their head-turning sports gear. Scroll down for video . Stopping traffic: The British beach volleyball team managed just that yesterday as they played a game against the backdrop of the Houses of Parliament . Sporting stars: Members of Great Britain women's Beach Volleyball team (L-R) Denise Johns, Lucy Boulton, Shauna Mullin and Zara Dampney . The early-morning match was a stunt to remind drivers that the London 2012 Olympics will cause major disruption on the roads - as there will be an extra 1,000 games-related vehicles travelling every hour. Beach volleyball will be held at Horse Guards Parade this summer, with 5,000 tons of sand shipped in for the players to compete on. Tickets for the sport were among the fastest to sell out, despite it being little-played in the UK. The British team usually trains in the warmer climes of California and Tenerife but were able to take advantage of this week’s homegrown heatwave for their Parliament Square exhibition. The stunt was aimed at reminding commuters that roads are likely to be busier at peak times during the 2012 Games . The event was held not only to indicate the effect on traffic but also to help launch Transport for London’s (TfL) online planning tool entitled Temporary Road Changes. Garrett Emmerson, TfL’s surface transport chief operating officer, said: 'We are doing everything we can to make sure people are aware of, and can comply with, the changes that will be made to London’s roads during the Games. 'Roads in central London and around venues will be exceptionally busy during the Games. Our Temporary Road Changes tool means roads users can see where there will be changes to the road network, allowing them to plan ahead. 'Our advice is to avoid driving in central London and around the Olympic Route Network (ORN) and venues or, if journeys are absolutely essential, to plan ahead and allow extra time.' Signs along the roads and public information campaigns before and during the Games will ensure roads users have all the information they need to comply with the changes. Parking or stopping on the Olympic Route Network will be restricted. A penalty charge of £130 will be issued to owners of vehicles who break these regulations during the Games and any illegally parked vehicle will be removed to a pound. Beach Volleyball made its Olympic debut at Atlanta 1996 and has since become one of the most popular spectator sports at the Games. This year it will be played between July 28 and August 12 at a special temporary arena on Horse Guards Parade. Shauna Mullin and her partner Zara Dampney, ranked 34th in the world, and Denise Johns and Lucy Boulton, ranked 50th are Britain’s women’s beach volleyball Olympic hopefuls. At least one team (pair) is guaranteed a place, but whether both make it won’t be known until next month. The United States has won five of the eight Olympic gold medals since the sport’s introduction. Larissa Franca and Juliana Felisberta of Brazil clinched a gold medal as beach volleyball returned to Beijing for the first time since the 2008 Olympics as teams went head-to-head in the FIVB Swatch World Tour .

A student who posted a series of racist comments on Twitter following footballer Fabrice Muamba’s cardiac arrest has begun a prison sentence of 56 days. Liam Stacey, 21, caused widespread revulsion by reacting to Muamba’s mid-game collapse by writing: ‘LOL [laughing out loud], **** Muamba. He’s dead!!! #haha.’ He responded to criticism of that message with vile racist tweets. The messages were forwarded to the police by several members of the social network, including former England striker Stan Collymore, himself a victim of abuse on Twitter. Shame: Liam Stacey is led away in handcuffs outside Swansea Magistrates Court . Stacey initially claimed his account . had been accessed by somebody else, but later pleaded guilty to racially . aggravated harassment. He was sent to prison to ‘reflect the public . outrage’ at his comments. As he spent his first night . behind bars, the two teams most shaken by Muamba's collapse replayed the . fixture that was called off when the midfielder came close to . death. Tottenham Hotspur and Bolton Wanderers met again at White Hart Lane, with the home team cruising to a 3-1 victory. It means Muamba's club are now out of the FA Cup, but this hardly seemed to matter to the fans and players treating the match as a chance to pay tribute to him. Stacey, seen arriving at the court earlier in the morning, posted a series of vile tweets about footballer Fabrice Muamba . At the ground where the 23-year-old's . heart stopped, his teammate Sam Ricketts was seen to wipe a tear from . his eye before kick-off. It was a difficult return for the entire Bolton . squad, and manager Owen Coyle commended them for their bravery. Players from both sides wore T-shirts . bearing messages of thanks to those who supported Muamba, while the . whole of the Tottenham stadium erupted in applause for him. Stacey, meanwhile, faces expulsion from . Swansea University. The third-year biology student had hoped to become a . forensic scientist.

These were unprovoked comments and persistent abuse. The . recipients were disgusted.’ Jailing the student at Swansea . Magistrates’ Court, District Judge John Charles said: ‘Not just the . footballer’s family, not just the footballing world, but the whole world . were literally praying for Muamba’s life. Your comments aggravated this . situation. ‘I have no choice but to impose an immediate custodial sentence to reflect the public outrage at what you have done.’ Stacey made his comments about the . Bolton Wanderers midfielder while celebrating the Welsh . rugby team’s Six Nations grand slam victory earlier this month. The judge added: ‘You committed this . offence while you were drunk and it is clear you immediately regretted . it. 'But you must learn how to handle your alcohol better.’ Stacey, from Pontypridd, South Wales, . told police following his arrest at his student home in Swansea: ‘I was . at the bar when I heard what had happened to Muamba. 'I don’t know why I . posted [the comments]. I’m not racist and some of my friends are from . different cultural backgrounds.’ He later sent a text message to a . friend saying: ‘I said something about Muamba that I shouldn’t have and . tweeted back to some people who abused me. 'Getting police on me now . which isn’t good at all.’ Another read: ‘Been bawling my eyes out on the phone to my mother for the last hour, really can’t be dealing with this.’ Applause: Everybody clapped for Muamba at the start of the match (and below) Gareth Jones, defending, said Stacey . ‘does not bear [Muamba] any grudge and is glad he is making a good . recovery’. He continued: ‘My client simply lost his head and posted . these disgusting comments to the bitter shame of himself and his . parents.

Witnesses said that the young boy did not appear to be aware of the coach until the last moment. As he saw the coach, and the boy turned to his left and raised his hands in anticipation of the impact . Alex Chalk, prosecuting, said: ‘There . was no time for him to jump away and he went straight to the floor . passing under the rear wheels. 'Despite desperate efforts to save him, Nemo Tin died at the scene.' Southwark Crown Court, London, where Mr Geale was given a suspended prison sentence and a three year ban from driving . Geale, a father of two, served as a corporal from 1976 to 1989 and carried out a tour of Northern Ireland where he came under fire. After the accident he was seen in shock slumped in the foot-well of the coach. He had been driving school children home from Dulwich College, as he did on a regular basis, and there were two boys left on the bus when tragedy struck. Geale, of New Cross, south-east London, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving. Karen Dempsey, defending, said: ‘This has had an absolutely devastating impact on Mr Geale and continues to do so.’ He has now lost his job with Excalibur Coaches, who attended the hearing to support him, and had an ‘overwhelming sense of guilt at any happiness in his life’, she said. Ms Dempsey added: ‘Actually going to work itself has been very, very difficult for him. ‘Initially he avoided certain driving routes that went past the scene. On a daily basis he was transporting children to and from their place of education.’ He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for two years with 150 hours unpaid work and banned from driving for three years.","Ten-year-old Yat Yeung 'Nemo' Tin died at the scene .

Abandoned: Lil Drac has been taken under a new wing at The Bat Sanctuary in Texas . Lil Drac was taken in by the Bat Sanctuary and given the confidence he needed to fully develop without his mother. When the sanctuary first took him under their wing, he was warmed up, comforted and fed, then moved into an incubator so he would stay warm at all times. He quickly learned to nurse his milk formula from a foam tip and looked forward to feeding time.. Lil Drac likes to rock himself back and forth after he has eaten and after he had groomed and also loves to groom his tiny body and stretch and flap his minuscule wings. Vulnerable: Short tailed fruit bat Lil Drac was abandoned by his mother just after being born . When Lil Drac was old enough, he was slowly reintroduced back into the flight cage to be with other of bats of his own kind. He slept by day in the incubator, and was moved into a netted basket to spend his nights in the flight enclosure - to protect him and allow him to feel safe while getting to know the other bats. He was given practice flight lessons and within in a few weeks, the netting over the basket was lifted so he could fly in and out at will. Winged it: Adorable Lil Drac shows off his tiny wing . Lil Drac now lives with his bat friends full time, and is a happy resident of the Bat Sanctuary. Fruit bats (Carollia perspicillata) can vary in size from around two to 16 inches long and have the best vision of all bat species. They are most commonly found in areas of thick forests and countries with warm climates.",Lil Drac is being cared for and flourishing at the The Bat Sanctuary in Texas .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:47 EST, 2 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 00:01 EST, 3 June 2012 . The credibility of Trayvon Martin's shooter could become an issue at . trial after a Florida judge said that George Zimmerman and his wife lied . to the court about their finances to obtain a bond, legal experts say. That's because the case hinges on jurors believing Zimmerman's account . of what happened the night that the 17-year-old Martin was killed. 'The other key witness, unfortunately, is deceased,' said Orlando-area attorney Randy McClean, a former prosecutor. 'Basically, Zimmerman is going to be asking the jury to believe his . version of the facts. ... As the case stands now, his credibility is . absolutely critical to the case.' Revoked: George Zimmerman testifies from the stand during a bond hearing on second degree murder charges at the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford, Florida in this file photo taken April 20, 2012 . Zimmerman's credibility would be important if his attorney, Mark O'Mara, . tries to get a judge without the jury to dismiss the charges based on . the law, said Orlando defense attorney David Hill. 'If he was in on something that was not truthfully revealed to the judge, . when there is a `stand your ground' hearing, of course you're going to . second-guess him,' said Hill. The revocation of Zimmerman's bond also puts pressure on O'Mara not to delay the trial, McClean said. 'When your client is out on bond, the pressure is much lighter to . rush to trial ... because your client is sitting at home,"" he said. 'When your client is sitting at the Seminole County Jail, your client is . going to want this resolved.' The questioning of Zimmerman's truthfulness by the judge on Friday could . undermine the defendant's credibility if it is brought up at trial. It . also may complicate how his defense presents him as a witness. George Zimmerman, charged with killing 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, right, stands next to a Seminole County Deputy during a court hearing in Sanford . Zimmerman had not turned himself in as of early Saturday evening, the day after his bond was revoked. He must do so by Sunday afternoon. He went into hiding in the weeks after the shooting amid an impassioned debate about the case, and his exact whereabouts since he bonded out of jail remain unclear. It also was not immediately clear exactly where Zimmerman would surrender. As he revoked Zimmerman's bail on Friday, the judge said Mr Zimmerman had responsibilities to stop his wife, who testified at one hearing, and . his lawyer from making false statements. 'Mr Zimmerman can't sit back a potted palm and let his wife . testify falsely before the court when he knew well in advance of the . hearing the amounts of money in controversy,' said Judge Kenneth Lester. Case: Zimmerman, right, shot Martin, left, in February during a confrontation at a gated community of townhouses in Sanford, Florida, where Zimmerman lived and where Martin was visiting his father's fiancee . 'He can't sit back and obtain the . benefit of a lower bond based upon those material falsehoods.' Under Florida's Rules of Criminal Procedure, a judge has discretion to revoke a defendant's bail if he finds there's 'good cause' to do so. Lying to a court about one's finances apparently fits the bill. In arguing for George Zimmerman's bail to be revoked, prosecutors asserted his wife Shelly 'flat-out lied' to get a lower bail. 'This . court was led to believe that [George Zimmerman and his wife] didn't . have a single penny,' one prosecutor argued. A Seminole County Sheriff's Deputy waits for George Zimmerman in front of the Seminole County Jail after Zimmerman's bond was revoked in Sanford, Florida . But it turns out the . Zimmermans had collected about $200,000 in online donations via a . website -- a fact Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara has acknowledged. In . addition, Zimmerman and his wife 'spoke in code to hide what they were . doing' during jail telephone calls, prosecutors alleged. Prosecutors also used phone . conversations recorded between Zimmerman and . his wife Shelly, to show that the pair intentionally deceived the court . by talking in code that designates multiples of thousands to much lower . sums. George Zimmerman asks: 'in my account do I have at least $100? Shelly Zimmerman responds: '$8. $8.60' Bailed: Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman (L) leaves the Seminole County Jail in April after posting bail in Sanford, Florida . Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said the fact that Zimmerman and his wife never used the money for anything indicated 'there was no deceit.' Since his release in late April, Zimmerman has been staying at an undisclosed location for his safety. Prosecutor Bernie De la Rionda described the Zimmermans' testimony as 'misleading'. 'This court was led to believe they didn't have a single penny,' said De la Rionda. 'It was misleading and I don't know what words to use other than it was a blatant lie.' The judge said he . would schedule a hearing after Zimmerman is back in custody so the . neighborhood watch leader could explain himself. It was also revealed that Zimmerman kept a second passport at his home and he and his wife can be heard to discuss it. 'I have one for you in the safety deposit box,' said Shellie. 'Okay, you hold onto that,' replied Zimmerman. Shot dead: In this undated photo provided by the Martin family, Trayvon Martin holds an unidentified baby. Martin was killed by a neighborhood watchman following an altercation in Sanford, Fla. as he walked from a convenience store in February, 2012 . Zimmerman is . pleading not guilty to second-degree murder and claims self-defense. Zimmerman shot Martin in February during a confrontation at a gated . community of townhouses in Sanford, Fla., where Zimmerman lived and . where the 17-year-old Martin was visiting his father's fiancee. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Trayvon Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, said his clients have always said Zimmerman should remain in jail until trial, which O'Mara said he believed wouldn't be until next year. Crump was asked if he thought that if Zimmerman would be willing to lie about his finances that he would be willing to lie about what happen the night Martin was killed. 'We fully expect that the special prosecutor will make George Zimmerman's credibility be front and center in this entire case,' Crump said. 'And whatever dishonesty that comes forth by George Zimmerman that they can prove, you can best believe it will be the issue of this case and rightfully so. Prosecutors also said Zimmerman had failed to surrender a second passport, but the judge dismissed that concern as the equivalent of someone who has lost a driver's license, applies for a new one and then finds the old driver's license. Killed: Zimmerman is pleading not guilty to second-degree murder and claims self-defense in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin . The delay in an arrest for 44 days prompted protests nationwide and led to Sanford's police chief stepping aside so emotions could cool down. At Friday's court hearing, De la . Rionda and O'Mara also asked a judge to stop the public release of . witness names and statements made by Zimmerman to police officers. Those . documents normally are part of the public record under Florida law. George Zimmerman started a website to raise funds for his legal defence under the URL www.therealgeorgezimmerman.com in April. ‘I have created a Paypal account solely linked on this website as I would like to provide an avenue to thank my supporters personally and ensure that any funds provided are used only for living expenses and legal defence,’ he posted on the website in April . According to prosecutors, he allegedly raised $135,000 but the website was shut down on April 24 so his attorney could regain control of the fundraising drive. The 28-year-old's bond hearing was on April 20, where the amount of money the website had raised was not disclosed. Zimmerman was released from jail on April 23 on a $150,000 bond after paying 10 per cent upfront. Later that week, his lawyer told CNN that the website had raised more than $200,000 in donations. 'What's . occurring, unfortunately, are cases are being tried in the public . sector as opposed to in the courtroom,' De La Rionda said. 'We are in a . new age with Twitter, Facebook, and all these things I've never heard of . before in my career. Everybody gets to find out intimate details about . witnesses that never occurred before. Witnesses are going to be . reluctant to get involved.' A consortium of more than a dozen media groups, including The Associated Press, asked the judge to ignore the request, saying such records are presumed to be publicly available under Florida law. Rachel Fugate, an attorney for the Orlando Sentinel, cited the Casey Anthony trial as an example of a highly publicized case in which a jury was able to be seated despite intense media coverage. The Florida mother was acquitted last year of killing her 2-year-old daughter. 'Discovery in Florida has traditionally been open ... and Florida hasn't encountered problems seating juries and giving defendants fair trials,' Fugate said. O'Mara said Friday on a website that he doesn't expect the case to be ready for trial until next year. O'Mara said he expects to call on 50 witnesses who need to be deposed before he decides whether to file a ""stand your ground"" motion which would ask for a hearing before a judge without a jury. At the hearing, Zimmerman would argue self-defense under the Florida law which gives wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat in a fight if people believe they are in danger of being killed or seriously injured.

A tenant has been sentenced to 10 years after being found guilty of stabbing his housemate to death in an argument over a blocked toilet. James Biddinger, 27, was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in March over the fatal stabbing of 22-year-old Kevin Mbayo in a townhouse in Germantown, Maryland in the US, in May 2011. The property was home to several people who rented rooms, however Mbayo was not a tenant, but he had been living with his father Ernest Mbayo who rented a room at the address, according to the New York Post and myfoxny.com . James Biddinger, pictured, was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter over the fatal stabbing of Kevin Mbayo, 22, in a house in Germantown, Maryland . During the trial, the court heard how Biddinger's seething resentment towards Mbayo became all-encompassing. The 27-year-old was allegedly unhappy that Mbayo had lived at the townhouse without paying rent, and had been using a communal sofa in the home, the New York Post said. On the night of the attack, Biddinger discovered that a toilet in the property had been clogged and blamed Mbayo for it. In the violent confrontation that ensued, he stabbed the younger man. In sentencing on Friday, Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge, Robert A. Greenberg, outlined his reasons for exceeding recommended punishment guidelines under Maryland law. Greenberg said, according to the press reports, that Biddinger had brought a knife to confront Mbayo, fled the scene after the attack and had shed 'crocodile tears' when he was later told of Mbayo's death. Biddinger had also attempted to persuade eyewitnesses against testifying, Greenberg said. 'Fortunately, you didn't succeed,' the judge added. Biddinger, who has been in jail since his arrest in May 2011, will be eligible for parole after five years. During the trial, the court heard how third housemate, Miles Edward Willis had heard the fight from his room, beneath the lounge. He said he heard a loud thud, as if someone had fallen to the floor, according to gazette.net, from a March report on the trial. Willis also found one of his kitchen knives with blood on it hidden on the kitchen counter six days after the fight, he testified. Willis said he found the knife between a cereal box and the kitchen wall; he called police immediately to submit it as possible evidence. Attorneys said in opening arguments Monday that Biddinger had taken the knife used in the stabbing with him when he left the house, throwing it out the car window as his friend drove him to the Wal-Mart before cooperating with police to locate the weapon that night.","James Biddinger, 27, resented his housemate because he didn't pay rent .

The families of three firemen killed in a warehouse blaze have called a chief fire officer 'hypocritical', 'arrogant' and 'small minded' after he welcomed the acquittal of three long-serving firefighters who had been charged with manslaughter over the tragedy. Graeme Smith, the head of Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service, claimed Adrian Ashley, Paul Simmons and Timothy Woodward had been 'treated like common criminals' in the wake of the fatal fire at Atherstone-on-Stour in 2007. Jurors at Stafford Crown Court yesterday cleared watch manager Ashley, 45, and 51-year-old station manager Woodward of gross negligence manslaughter after hearing six weeks of evidence about the deaths of Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, John Averis and Ian Reid. Watch manager Simmons, 50, was acquitted of the same charge on the directions of the judge part-way through the trial. Police never found the criminals who started the fire and £4.7million has been spent over five . years trying to pin blame for the losses on the managers who let the . firemen enter the building even though all employees had already been . accounted for. Speaking after the verdicts, Mr Smith said it was 'crystal clear' that the case should not have been brought to court and called for an investigation into why the three men were prosecuted. But at a press conference in Warwickshire today, relatives of Mr Stephens, Mr Reid and Mr Yates-Badley said they had been let down by Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service following the fire at a vegetable packing plant on November 2. The family of Mr Averis were present but decided not to speak. Ian Reid’s widow Julie said she had been devastated by the not guilty verdicts, adding: 'Why does Warwickshire chief fire officer Smith think this case should not have gone to court? Does he not think that where the evidence is there, action should be taken? 'Is he really that arrogant and small minded to think that firefighters are above the law? 'We are all accountable for our actions, even the police. No one is above the law. Victims: (clockwise from top left) Darren Yates-Badley, Ashley Stephens, Ian Reid and John Averis were killed  tackling the blaze in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, in 2007. Their families are angry at the fire service's reaction to the manslaughter acquittal . 'We have a legal process in this . country and if the police suspect a crime has been committed they are . duty bound to investigate and pass their findings to the Crown . Prosecution Service. 'The legal process will determine . whether charges should be brought, not the profession of an individual. The jury could not find guilt in this case. But if this case makes . incident commanders take one extra minute to assess the situation . presented on arriving at an incident then that can only be for the good. 'A firefighter’s life is not worth . less than that of a member of the public and it most certainly is not . worth a pallet of packing material.' Mrs Reid, who described the fire . service as a 'sleepy hollow', added: 'I do acknowledge that the . defendants and their families have had a difficult year with this . hanging over their heads but it is nothing compared to the heartache . that Sophie (the couple’s daughter) and I have suffered for four and a . half years. Cleared: Watch Manager Adrian Ashley and Station Manager Timothy Woodward were found not guilty of . manslaughter following the deaths of four firefighters killed when a roof collapsed during warehouse blaze . Cleared: Station Manager Timothy Woodward speaks to the media flanked by Watch Leaders Paul Simmonds and Adrian Ashley yesterday. The three men were cleared of causing the deaths of four colleagues . 'I lost my husband, who I loved very much, and Sophie lost the dad she adored. Our heartache and loss is permanent.' Paul Stephens, the firefighter father of Ashley Stephens, was present at the blaze that killed his son. In a statement read on his behalf by a . police liaison officer, he said: 'As his father, and at the time a . serving firefighter being present at the incident, having witnessed the . horrendous scene on that night has left me with images that will stay . with me forever - images so strong I have not been able to attend the . court hearing. 'The loss of Ashley has left such a big hole in our hearts that it is impossible to mend. 'Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service . gave us unlimited support up until the charges were brought against . three of their officers. After that it seemed we were on the wrong side . and support dwindled down to nothing. 'To hear the Chief Fire Officer speak . to the press saying their thoughts were with the families was very . hypocritical as the only family support shown has been to the . defendants’ families. Tragedy: Firefighters Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, John Averis and Ian Reid were killed as they tackled the blaze in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, in 2007 . 'Ashley loved being part of the fire . service and wanted to become a full-time firefighter. It seems so unjust . that the full- time officers he would have looked up to have let him . down so badly.' Mandy Baylis, the mother of Darren Yates-Badley, said: 'That night will haunt me forever. 'I never thought I would feel so let . down by the fire service. They talk about brothers in arms and one big . family. This is not true in our case. 'Family and friends of Alcester Fire . Station, which we have been part of for 25 years, have crossed over the . street rather than speak to us. 'It’s as if we’ve done something . wrong. All we did is lose Darren in the most impossible way. Not to be . able to say goodbye... Darren didn’t deserve that.' Addressing the media at the end of the . trial, Chief Fire Officer Mr Smith said: 'It is crystal clear that . these cases should never have been brought to court. 'The police investigation into this fire took a wrong turn early on. Collapse: An aerial view shows the roof of the warehouse after it collapsed killing the four firefighters . The Fire Brigade Union said it was absurd that the arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial, while those who struggled to put it out were 'relentlessly pursued' by police and the CPS . 'The police treated decent fire officers like common criminals and the arsonist who started this fire has got away with it. 'It has taken almost five years and . £5million of public money to construct a case against these three men . and when it was presented in court it simply fell apart.' During two days in the custody of . Warwickshire Police, Mr Simmons, Mr Ashley, and Mr Woodward had their . belts and shoelaces taken away and were also held at a police station . overnight between interviews. Mr Smith said Warwickshire Fire and . Rescue Service and the Chief Fire Officers’ Association intended to . write to the Home Secretary and the Justice Secretary to seek a formal . investigation why the firefighters were charged. After yesterday's verdicts, critics said . firemen may now hesitate before trying to save lives for fear they could . be arrested. Verdict: . After hearing six weeks of evidence jurors decided Mr Woodward and Mr . Ashley had not acted illegally during their command of the incident on . the evening of November 2 2007 .

A teenage gun collector was locked up today after he shot his best friend then created an elaborate lie about him being gunned down in the street by a hoodie thug. Antoine Anicotte, 19, accidentally fired at Nicholas Culpan with a replica 1858 Remington Revolver, a copy of a firearm used during the American Civil War. French-born Anicotte's mother Catherine gave him the weapon as a gift - which is legal in France - but requires a licence in the UK. Antoine Anicotte, 19, accidentally fired at Nicholas Culpan with a replica 1858 Remington Revolver, similar to the gun pictured here . But Anicotte accidentally shot Nicholas during a get-together at his flat in Dover, Kent, in January last year - after they had played video games together. Canterbury Crown Court, heard Mr Culpan, who was 18 at the time, staggered into the street then collapsed in a pool of blood before he was rushed to the William Harvey Hospital, in Ashford, Kent. Medics discovered the bullet had 'nicked' the victim's liver and he was transferred to London's King College Hospital for emergency life-saving surgery. Desperate Anicotte, who collects memorabilia from the American Civil War period, sparked a full scale search for a gunman, after telling police his friend had been gunned down in the street by a man in a white hoodie. The teen - who had used the gun to fire at seagulls earlier in the day - then named a man who was arrested and spent the night in police cells, before being released. Sentencing the accidental gunman to four years in a young offender's institute Judge Simon James told him his actions had been 'monumentally and criminally a stupid'. He said: 'I have grave concerns regarding the risk you pose. You knew that the gun had been loaded because you had loaded a charge into the firing chamber. 'That wasn't simply a reckless act it was monumentally and criminally a stupid one, which could have and almost did have fatal consequences.'Denzil Pugh, prosecuting, told the court Anicotte had been with Mr Culpan and another friend with the weapon at half-cock, loaded with a ball, wadding, black powder and a percussion cap. Trial: Antoine Anicotte was sentenced to four years in a young offender's institute by a judge at Canterbury Crown Court, pictured . He said: 'Anicotte seems to have a morbid fascination with weapons and had quite a collection of weapons at his home. 'He had this weapon which can only be possessed with a certificate for some time. 'It would seem on that afternoon as they played video games they had a little alcohol and a little cannabis. 'This weapon was then brought out and Anicotte began fooling around with it. Quite what happened next was a blur to everyone there. 'With substantial recklessness, Anicotte had put the percussion cap into the weapon - without it, the gun couldn't be fired. 'Maybe the gun was knocked, or an inadvertent jerk, the three heard a very loud report and the gun went off. It hit Mr Culpan in the right-hand side.' Emily Cook, defending, said Anicotte - who has spent the past year and a half in a mental hospital after suffering a breakdown - now hears the sound of the gun going off every time he tries to go to sleep. Anicotte broke down and wept as he was sentenced in front of his mother. He admitted charges of unlawful wounding, possessing a firearm and attempting to pervert the course of justice.","Antoine Anicotte was given a replica 1858 Remington Revolver by his mother .

Arriving: Dharun Ravi arrives in a van at Middlesex County Department of Corrections to begin his sentence . The Star-Ledger reported that Ravi got quite a media reception – at least 15 cameramen and photographers greeted him outside of the Middlesex County Sheriff’s Office. Shortly after he entered, Ravi’s father, Ravi Pazhani, and his defence attorney Philip Nettl left the office. Sheriff Mildred Scott told the Star-Ledger: ‘(Ravi) got to say goodbye to his family,’ adding that he would go through the booking process and would be taken to the Middlesex County Corrections Centre. Ravi was then driven to the county jail to serve a 30-day term, though he will likely be out in 20 because of time off for good behaviour. The 21-year-old is also appealing the sentence, meaning it could be thrown out all together. Ravi's roommate, Tyler Clementi, committed suicide in September 2010, days after Ravi used a webcam to see him kissing another man.

'Ravi is not to blame for the hardships endured by the gay community nor should he be tied to the whipping post because of it. If Tyler was not gay, this would have been just a prank gone wrong and no one would have rushed to incarcerate.' Soon after that, the letters began pouring into Superior Court Judge Glenn Berman's chambers making requests for how to handle sentencing. Ravi faced up to 10 years in prison. Last week, Judge Berman told him he would have to serve 30 days in jail. Because the sentence is less than a year, it decreases the chances that federal immigration authorities will seek to have Ravi deported to India, where he was born and remains a citizen. Prosecutors said they would appeal the sentence as too light. Ravi, who maintains he is innocent, is considering appealing the entire conviction. Before delivering the sentence, Berman held up a folder, inches thick, of the letters he'd received from the public. Later, he quoted one of them, calling Clementi's suicide the 'pink elephant' in the case. Berman made the letters publicly available, but only after having court staff cross out the last names, addresses of and other identifying information about their authors. He said the writers may have expected their communications with him would be private. It's a case that's been dissected by pundits and advocates, addressed by President Barack Obama, debated on by hundreds of bloggers, tweeters and online newspaper commenters and discussed at countless dinner tables. The people who decided to address Berman directly represent just one sliver of the public comment on the tragedy — but a particularly passionate one. Tragic end: Rutgers student Tyler Clementi jumped off the George Washington Bridge in 2010 after webcam footage showing he and another man kissing circulated the internet . Residence hall: Clementi and Ravi shared Room 30 of Davidson Hal, Rutgers University . The case began in September 2010 when Ravi's randomly assigned freshman-year roommate asked Ravi to stay away so he and a guest could have privacy. Ravi went to a friend's room and turned on his webcam remotely. Jurors at his trial earlier this year heard that he and the friend saw just seconds of Clementi kissing the guest, who was identified in court only by the initials M.B. When Tyler, an 18-year-old violinist from Ridgewood, asked for privacy again two days later, Ravi agreed - then told friends how they could access his webcam. But this time, the webcam was not on when M.B. came over. There was testimony both that Clementi unplugged it and that Ravi himself put it to sleep. The next night, Tyler jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge. Jurors learned that he checked Ravi's Twitter feed repeatedly before his suicide. Clementi is seen as an example of what can happen to young gays who are too often bullied even as acceptance of gays has increased. After the suicide, gay-rights and anti-bullying activists held him up as an example of the horrible consequences of bullying young gays. Even President Barack Obama spoke about the tragedy.

As Spain's economy faces financial meltdown it has emerged that the country has its very own 'Fred the Shred' Goodwin, who is to receive a multimillion payout at the same time as his failing bank asks for a £15billion bailout. The news that former finance director at crippled Spanish lender Bankia Aurelio Izquierdo is to receive £11million after stepping down from his position at the bank has infuriated the Spanish public. Mr Izquierdo, who is one of a number of bankers to receive huge bonuses during Spain's artificially inflated property boom, has also received heavy criticism from the country's political opponents. Anger: Former Bankia finance director Aurelio Izquierdo, left, who is to receive £11million despite the bank asking for a £15billion bailout. The story is reminiscent of Fred 'The Shred' Goodwin - the former chief executive of RBS . Britain's top share index bounced back in early trade this morning, recovering after a sharp fall yesterday that took it below the 5,300 point level, with Wednesday's big fallers - banks, energy, and mining stocks - leading the rally. Both the party in power - the centre-right Partido Popular and the Catalan Republic Left have united in their disgust for the banker who they say is making a huge profit out of a terrible situation. Mr Izquierdo's story is reminiscent of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) banker Fred Goodwin whose Knighthood was annulled in 2009 after his strategy of aggressive expansion led to the near collapse of the company in 2008. The Spanish version of Mr Goodwin could receive his huge sum within weeks while the plight of Bankia remains in the balance.

As concerns about the costs of funding Spain's banking system and cash-strapped regional authorities mounted, beleaguered Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy was also struggling with ruinously high borrowing costs on international markets. Bankia representatives say the cash being channeled to Mr Izquierdo comes from a pot of funds which have already been accounted for at Bancaja - one of seven savings banks which combined in 2011 to form Bankia.

"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 05:15 EST, 29 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:27 EST, 29 May 2012 . Police have admitted the body of Etan Patz will probably never be found 33 years after he went missing, it was claimed today. Sources said the New York Police Department have accepted Etan's parents, Julie and Stan, will never get the chance to bury the remains of their little boy. It came as Etan's father Stan took a heartbreaking bicycle ride past the site where his six-year-old son was allegedly murdered in New York. Long-standing mystery: The disappearance of Etan Patz in 1979 remains one of America's most notorious crimes. Pictured right is his father Stan . Mr Patz, who lives just a few blocks away, got on his bike in front of his SoHo building and pedaled past the eyeglass store that now occupies 448 West Broadway, the New York Post reported today. The shop had been a bodega when Pedro Hernandez, who was aged 18 at the time and was a stock boy there, claims he stranged Etan. The 51-year-old has told cops he killed Etan in the bodega's basement May 25, 1979, and threw his body out with the garbage at nearby 113 Thompson Street. Hernandez claims to have lured the youngster to the store with the promise of soda and was charged with second degree murder. Following his admission, New York's Sanitation Department is examining its archive to try to determine where the trash might have been dumped. But a law-enforcement source told the New York Post  said that authorities 'are never going to undertake that kind of searching' if the trash was taken to a landfill. Stan and Julie Patz with a poster of their son, Etan, who went missing in 1979, outside their apartment in New York, on April 30, 1980 . Scene: This is the site of the bodega in SoHo where Hernandez claims he killed Etan in 1979 . Charged: Hernandez faced arraignment from his hospital bed, as shown in this court sketch . 'Killer': Hernandez, who was 18 in 1979, worked in a corner shop blocks from Etan's home . The source added: 'It would cost millions of dollars. You're talking about hundreds of tons of garbage.' Even with a search, 'You'd probably still never find that body.' Etan's remains could have been taken to the massive Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island - which was taller than the Statue of Liberty when it closed in 2001. The department is also believed to have dumped garbage in the Atlantic Ocean in 1979 and taken it to an incinerator - meaning there would be no remains. Finding the body is crucial to examining Hernandez's claim. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office needs evidence other than Hernandez's confession to prosecute him, legal experts have said. And so far there is no corroborating evidence, apart from from hearsay from some of his relatives and others that he told them years ago that he'd killed a child in New York, sources said. Route: The map shows the path Etan would have walked after leaving his SoHo home for the bus stop - and its proximity to the bodega where Hernandez worked . Hernandez, who is reportedly schizophrenic and bipolar, is currently on suicide watch at New York's Bellevue Hospital. The suspect's sister and a prayer group leader recently revealed Hernandez confessed to the murder during a prayer meeting in the 1980s. Norma Hernandez said her brother admitted the killing during a gathering of charismatic Christians at St. Anthony of Padua, a Roman Catholic church in Camden, New Jersey. Tomas Rivera, the group's leader, confirmed that he was present during the meeting, but felt he could not report the confession to police because it hadn't been made to him 'one on one'. The pivotal meeting happened in the early 1980s, a few years after Etan’s 1979 disappearance, when Mr. Hernandez was in his early 20s. The FBI and New York Police Department are at odds over whether Hernandez actually committed the notorious murder. Remembered: A makeshift memorial is placed outside the premises where Etan allegedly disappeared . Relief: If true, the claims will be closure for Stanley and Julie Patz, pictured standing by a missing poster of their son outside their New York apartment in April 1980 . Unsolved: Etan Patz vanished on the way to the school bus in SoHo, New York City in May 1978 . Inconsistencies in the bodega worker's confession have led the FBI to doubt his claims, and a police source told the New York Daily News the agency was 'very sceptical' and thought the police had moved too fast. The paper claimed Hernandez has provided detectives with 'intimate details' about the case that only the real killer of the six-year-old could have known. The exact details are not known, but could include information such as identifying characteristics on Patz’s body, including scars and birth marks, or the clothing he was wearing when he disappeared 33 years ago. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, and the charge means prosecutors do not believe he had planned in advance to kill Etan. The suspect reportedly told police he had never seen the six-year-old before the day he killed him, but then, 'I knew he was the one... [I] just felt the urge to kill.' Mourning: Flowers are placed outside the Patz home on the day their son's alleged killer appears in court . Now his family appears to have turned on the self-confessed killer, as his sister insisted that he should 'pay for what he did' if found guilty of second-degree murder. Margarita Lopez said: 'If he did something he should pay for it. I have kids and if something happened to them the person that did it will have to pay. 'It doesn't matter if he's my son, my brother, my father or whatever. They would have to pay for what they did.' As Hernandez confessed his crime to police, according to New York police chief Raymond Kelly, he seemed 'remorseful' and had a 'feeling of relief'. But he provided no motive for the killing. Police say they consider Hernandez's signed confession to be reliable, having spent three and a half hours interviewing him. Etan's parents, Julie and Stanley, who have never moved from the SoHo apartment where they lived at the time of his disappearance, were taken-aback when told of the admission, but are said to have handled it well. The Patz family has always maintained that the culprit for their son's disappearance was convicted paedophile Jose Ramos. Jailed for an unrelated crime, Ramos, 68, later told a prison cell mate he knew every stop of the bus route that took Etan to school and knew the six-year-old got off at the third stop. He admitted to taking a boy back to his apartment to rape him on the day Etan disappeared, but he said he let the boy go. He said he was '90 per cent sure' it was the same boy he later saw on TV. No hard evidence has linked him to the crime. He is now in a Pennsylvania jail on a 20-year sentence for abusing two boys and is due to be released in November. Etan's father has previously said: 'Jose Antonio Ramos is the man who abducted my child. We lost our child to a paedophile, and that's not comprehensible.' Convinced that Ramos is guilty of the crime, Mr Patz sends him a copy of his son's missing child poster twice a year, with the words 'What have you done with my little boy' written on the back. However, police do not believe Etan was sexually assaulted before his death. Etan's disappearance sparked an international manhunt in 1979, and May 25 - the last day he was seen alive - is now National Missing Children's Day in America.","Father Stan makes heart-breaking bike ride past scene of disappearance .

It could soon be illegal to ask a woman to stop breastfeeding in public places after mothers have campaigned to make it a civil right. A group in Seattle has been pushing lawmakers to make it a crime to ask women feeding their babies to cover up or leave the premises. Breastfeeding in public is already legal in the city - but council member Bruce Harrell said enshrining breastfeeding as a civil right would have a multitude of health benefits for the mother and child along with lowering infant mortality rates. Scroll down for video . Mothers' rights: A woman breastfeeds during a council meeting in Seattle as lawmakers debated whether to make breastfeeding in public a civil right . Mr Harrell said the law would encourage mothers from ethnic minorities  - who have lower rates of breastfeeding their children.

Another mother Melissa Miller told SeattlePI.com how she . was once asked by a shop assistant to feed her baby in a changing room at the store to prevent other customers from being offended. Following the council meeting, around a dozen mothers gathered for a 'feed in' at council buildings. However not all Seattle residents were on board with the idea. Kate Calhoun told Msnbc: 'I can see where a lot of people would be really uncomfortable in certain situations.' Breast is best: Mothers listened to arguments at the meeting before staging a 'feed-in' at the council buildings . Laws on breastfeeding varied from state to state. According to Mothering.com last year, in the state of Tennessee, for example, the law protected breastfeeding in public but only of a one-year-old or younger. In Ohio, however, it had been ruled that breastfeeding discrimination is sexual discrimination. By comparison, Virginia law states a right to breastfeed on state-owned property only. Seattle council is expected to come to a decision this Monday, April 9.

A baby born even a month earlier than . it is due, or preemie as we know it, can develop pneumonia, poor vision . and hearing, sleep problems and may even die. And that's not all. Now a major . study published in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood says . preterm babies can develop severe mental health problems too. Increased risk: Babies born more than eight weeks premature are '4.5 times as likely' to suffer from a severe mental illness such as depression, bipolar disorder or psychosis . This is the first study of its kind to show a link between . premature babies and a broad range of psychiatric disorders in later . life. They are at a high risk of developing bipolar disorders, severe . depression and even eating disorders. Researchers say that subtle . alterations in the brain development caused by early birth could be . responsible for the problem, rather than restricted growth or lack of . oxygen during childbirth. The news has left doctors in Delhi concerned, . in view of the surge in births of premature babies. 'There has been a 10 . per cent rise in preemies because of different lifestyle-related health . problems pregnant women suffer from. 'Gestational diabetes, polycystic . ovaries, hypertension and cases of amniotic fluid leaks are common now . and these are the high risk factors for a premature delivery. 'Late . pregnancy is another reason for this worrying trend,' said Dr Asha . Sharma, consultant gynaecologist, Rockland hospital. Doctors are concerned about rising numbers of premature babies - which are defined as being born at least three weeks early . Ideally, a baby . should be delivered close to the 40th week, but babies are being . delivered as early as the 32nd week. The study finds that babies born . four to eight weeks earlier are more likely to develop schizophrenia and . bipolar disorders and those born after just 32 weeks in the womb are . three times more likely to have a psychiatric disorder by the age of 16. 'Premature babies are kept in neonatal care from between a week to a . month. 'They are away from the vital pheromones that their mothers . secrete and this could be the reason for psychological problems later. 'These babies are generally of low weight at birth and that impacts their . health a lot,' said Dr Manika Khanna, director, Gaudium IVF Centre. While pediatricians are able to save preemies with the advancement in . the neonatal technology, there is hardly any followup on their health . later. 'We have no clue on what happens to our preterm babies. In India, . there is no proper large-scale study on their health status,' said Dr . Khanna. Health experts pointed out that it is important to identify . susceptible children and keep track of their health status.","Delhi doctors concerned as city sees a 10 per cent rise in premature babies .

"By . Tom Gardner . PUBLISHED: . 03:39 EST, 8 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:33 EST, 8 June 2012 . The Ministry of Defence has been blasted for employing more accountants than Army Officers. The number of beancounters at defence head quarters has risen to 858 - up almost three per cent in two years – at a time when thousands of frontline servicemen are facing the axe and swinging cuts. New figures, revealed in a response to a parliamentary question, also show the MoD has more accountants than all other Government departments combined. Facing cuts: The Army is in the midst of huge cutbacks to plug a defence budge black hole of around £42billion . Their army of Associate Chartered . Accountant qualified number-crunchers dwarfs the 80 working at the . Treasury department and eclipses the 381 at the Department for Work and . Pensions, which processes welfare payments. A further 153 employees were in the middle of their accountancy training. The embattled MoD, which . is midst of one of the toughest cost-cutting drives in its history, is . having to axe 22,000 troops, fleets of warships, ships and armoured . vehicles to fill a £42billion black hole in its budget. On the rise: The number of qualified accountants working at the MoD has risen over the past two years to 858 - while servicemen are facing cuts . Yet despite the huge arsenal of accounting expertise, the MoD has still been hit by a series of damaging blunders and accusations of waste and profligacy. Jonathan Isaby, Political Director of . the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘People expect their hard-earned cash to . be spent at the MoD defending the realm and properly equipping our . troops, not creating jobs for hundreds of beancounters. ‘Over the years the size of the civil service has swelled to a point where it is now seriously bloated. ‘Quite . how this legion of accountants can be justified is a mystery, . especially when you consider that all the other government departments . manage with so many fewer. ‘Of course those in uniform need support staff, but this number of accountants is astounding.’ Under the Strategic Defence and . Security Review (SDSR), unveiled in 2010, the Armed Forces must make . huge cuts in order to plug a massive shortfall in funding. Ministers said there was ‘no choice’ but to take ‘difficult decisions’ to tackle a ‘vast black hole’ in the MoD budget. But . a withering Commons report earlier this year found the cost of Britain’s biggest military . programmes has soared by £500million in a year because ‘wasteful’ defence chiefs failed to ‘live within their means’. Under fire: The Ministry of Defence has been hit by a series of damaging revelations over waste and profligacy which costs taxpayers billions of pounds . The Public Accounts Committee said 15 crucial procurement projects for new equipment, including ‘hunter-killer’ submarines, fighter jets, aircraft carriers and transport planes, are £6.1billion - or 11.4 per cent - over budget. Defence chiefs wasted £258million during a series of U-turns to make sure the replacement for the scrapped Harrier jump jets could fly from the Royal Navy’s £6.2billion warships. And last year it was revealed, cash-strapped MoD forked out nearly £600million of taxpayers’ money intended for equipment on hiring consultants, according to an internal audit. The audit accused the MoD of having budget controls that are ‘poorly developed or non-existent’. An MoD spokesperson said: ‘There are currently 632 qualified military and civilian accountants in posts across defence out of over a quarter of a million military and civilian staff overall. 'The number of Civil Servants in the MoD has fallen by nearly 15,000 since 2010 and the number of accountants is expected to fall. ‘The MoD has increased financial discipline to get the annual budget of around £35bn back on track. In addition to one of the largest budgets across Whitehall we have one of the biggest balance sheets, including nearly £130bn of assets. 'Accountants help manage hundreds of equipment projects to ensure value for money for the taxpayer and ensure that over 250,000 military personnel and civilian staff receive their pay and pensions.’","The number of accountants has risen to 858 - more than all Government departments combined .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:37 EST, 7 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:03 EST, 8 June 2012 . Ofsted faced criticism today after it emerged that inspection reports which declared two schools inadequate contained a number of identical sentences and phrases. Union leaders raised concerns that inspectors are simply 'cutting and pasting' in reports, warning that there is a problem with formulaic guidelines that inspectors must follow for school visits. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said that the practice is unacceptable, given that the fate of a school can rest on an inspection. Concerning: An Ofsted inspection can change a school's reputation . Two reports, one on Belvedere Junior School in Bexley, and one on Malmesbury Primary School in Tower Hamlets, east London, were found to include a high number of similarities, the Times Educational Supplement reported. Ofsted said it stood by the judgments in the reports, but is looking into the similarities in wording. Both contain the sentence: 'Some teachers do not plan learning for pupils at their different levels of ability and marking is not leading to improvement.' And both state: 'The majority of parents and carers are positive about how well the school develops their children's skills in reading, writing and mathematics.' Accusations: Two reports, one on Belvedere Junior School in Bexley, and one on Malmesbury Primary School in Tower Hamlets, east London, (pictured) were found to include a high number of similarities . In each report, inspectors disagree with this view. Both also make similar comments about the low attainment of pupils in reading, writing and maths. One goes on to say: 'This is because pupils, especially in Key Stage 2, . have not been taught effectively to sound out individual letters and groups of letters to work out unfamiliar words when reading. 'They have not been provided with enough opportunities across the curriculum to write at length and their grasp of basic number skills is not as secure as it should be. These weaknesses mean the curriculum is inadequate. The second says: 'This is because pupils have not been taught effectively to sound out individual letters and groups of letters to work out unfamiliar words. 'They have not been provided with enough opportunities across the curriculum to write at length, and their grasp of basic number skills is not as secure as it should be.' Both schools were visited by a team with the same lead inspector who works for Tribal, a company contracted by Ofsted to carry out inspections. Belvedere was inspected in January, with the report, which judged the school should be put into special measures, published in March. Malmesbury was inspected in March, with the report declaring it inadequate and requiring special measures published a month later. An Ofsted spokeswoman said: 'Both inspection reports were subject to moderation by Ofsted and we stand by the judgments they record.'We are concerned by the similarity of some of the wording used in the two reports and this is being looked into with the inspector concerned.' In a statement Tribal said it aims to ensure that reports 'reflect the uniqueness of schools'. 'Tribal stands by the judgments in these two particular reports,' it said. 'Similarities noted in some of the wording caused concern and are being rigorously investigated. If proven, Tribal will take swift action to stop using the inspector again. NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby told the TES that he had heard anecdotal accounts of other 'cut and paste' reports, adding that this is 'not acceptable given that the fate of the school rests on what is written.' NAHT head of research Lesley Gannon said: 'Problems are compounded at the second stage of the inspection process when the reports are rewritten by a moderator - someone who has never been to the school - who checks the descriptions to ensure they fit the grades described in the inspection schedule. 'Inspectors just cut and paste, regurgitating wording from the evaluation schedule. Therefore the reports are often more similar than they are individual.'","The National Association of Head .

"By . Tim Shipman And Ian Drury . UPDATED: . 18:27 EST, 2 February 2012 . Up to half of Britain’s forces in Afghanistan will come home next year after the Americans announced plans to speed up withdrawal by a year. Downing Street confirmed that British troops will no longer lead combat operations by the end of 2013, handing command responsibility to local Afghan forces 12 months earlier than expected. Plans have now been drawn up to cut the force of 9,000 British troops by at least 4,000 next year, with a series of steady drawdowns in troops throughout the year. Previously, David Cameron has said that British forces will no longer be in a combat role by the end of 2014, but ministers had failed to spell out that the handover to Afghan commanders will begin much earlier than that. Scroll down for video . Falling back: British troops will retain a supporting role . Sacrifice: Jack Sadler was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan in 2007. His father Ian described as 'devastating' a leaked report which reveals the Taliban are set to return to power . Trooper Jack Sadler was repatriated to RAF Lyneham five days after his death in December 2007 . Under the plans outlined yesterday, . British forces in Helmand Province will begin handing control to Afghan . generals in mid-2013 and sole control to them by the end of 2013. They will continue in a reduced . fighting role during 2014, providing logistics, engineering and air . support, but with growing numbers of troops withdrawing from . confrontation with the Taliban to conduct training. The accelerated timetable was . revealed by U.S. defence secretary Leon Panetta, who said America would . wind down combat operations in 2013. He said: ‘Hopefully by the mid to . later part of 2013, we’ll be able to make a transition from a combat . role to a training, advise and assist role. 'It doesn’t mean we’re not going to be combat-ready…[but] it’s not going to be a kind of formal combat role that we are in now.’ Mr Panetta’s choice of words caused . some irritation in London, and No 10 yesterday sought clarification from . the White House about President Obama’s intentions. Poised: A Taliban militant holds a grenade launcher in Herat. A secret U.S. report - The State Of The Taliban - claims the insurgent movement is poised to regain control of Afghanistan when Nato troops withdraw . Unbowed: The document claims Taliban fighters are being supported by Pakistan intelligence services across the border . Senior sources in London said the timetable was being driven by the presidential elections in both America and France. British officials indicated that the UK will co-ordinate its pullout to go along with the American timetable. The announcement follows the leaking of a confidential report that reveals that the . Taliban are set to return to power when British and Coalition forces end . their combat role. Despite . 10 years of fighting by Nato forces and their huge sacrifices - 397 . members of the British military alone have been killed and thousands . wounded - the report says that in the past year there has been . unprecedented interest, even from within the Afghan government, in . joining the Taliban. And it . points accusingly at Afghanistan's neighbour Pakistan, a key ally of . Nato, where powerful elements in the security and intelligence services . support the Taliban and describes how insurgent leaders maintain homes . within the heart of the capital Islamabad. Based on 27,000 interviews with over . 4,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners, the detailed report effectively . questions the Coalition’s own assessment that it is winning the war in . Afghanistan. The report - The State of the Taliban - . was described as ‘devastating’ by former soldier Ian . Sadler, whose son Jack, a 21-year-old reservist serving with the . Honourable Artillery Company, died in a roadside bomb blast in Helmand . in December 2007. Attacks: An explosion after an airstrike in Nanagarhar, Afghanistan. The report, based on interrogation of insurgents, claims Taliban fighters are being given weapons and training by Pakistan-backed militants . Cost: The remains of Private First Class Cody R. Norris arrive at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. More than ten years after the U.S.-led conflict in Afghanistan, the Taliban are poised to regain control . 'It has been a waste of time operating . in the way that the British have,' he said, 'Hearing details of the . report makes me wonder why our soldiers were sent there in the way they . were and the cost that has been paid.' The report compiled by U.S. forces . describes how weapons and vehicles given to Afghan forces have in turn . been passed on to the Taliban and says that Pakistan's feared . Inter-Services Intelligence Agency (ISI) is actively colluding with the . insurgents by actually directing attacks. 'Pakistan knows everything,' the report states, 'they control everything. The Taliban are not Islam. The Taliban are Islamabad. 'ISI officers tout the need for continued jihad (holy war) and expulsion of foreign invaders from Pakistan. 'The government of Pakistan remains intimately involved with the Taliban. 'ISI is thoroughly aware of Taliban . activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban personnel. Senior . Taliban leaders meet regularly with ISI personnel, who advise on . strategy and relay any pertinent concerns of the government of . Pakistan.' Those questioned, including senior . Taliban commanders, told how Islamabad uses a complex network of spies . and intermediaries to provide strategic advice to aid the Taliban in . fighting the coalition. No confidence: An Afghan border police officer receives his graduation certificate. There are concerns that the police, security forces and Afghan army will not be able to maintain order in the country when Nato forces leave . Unpopular: The Taliban is playing on public opinion of President Hamid Karzai's government . Explaining why new recruits are . turning in large numbers to the Taliban, fighters said : 'When the . Karzai government was established, we thought there was a chance of . something good. The harassment, corruption and abuse are unbearable. We . chose to fight. We chose the Taliban.' In a bleak conclusion, it paints a . picture of Al Qaeda’s influence diminishing but the Taliban’s influence . increasing, stating : 'Afghan civilians frequently prefer Taliban . governance over the Afghan government, usually as a result of government . corruption.' The report has evidence that the . Taliban are deliberately hastening NATO's withdrawal by reducing their . attacks in some areas and then initiating a comprehensive . hearts-and-minds campaign. The findings could heap further . pressure on David Cameron, and U.S. President Barack Obama, as they face . strengthened calls to withdraw troops before the 2014 deadline. It could also reinforce the view of . Taliban hardliners that the group should not negotiate peace with the . U.S. and President Hamid Karzai's unpopular government while in a . position of strength. Significantly, the Taliban said that reports they were about to begin talks with the Karzai . government in Saudi Arabia were untrue. 'The unfortunate reality is that this . is a failure of the allied strategy in Afghanistan. They have not been . able to achieve the goals they set out to achieve,' said Mahmud Durrani, . a former Pakistan army general and ambassador to Washington. Fresh accusations of Pakistani . collusion with the Taliban are likely to further strain ties between . Western powers and Islamabad, which has long denied backing militants . seeking to topple the U.S.-backed government in Kabul. Critics say Pakistan uses militant . groups as proxies to counter the growing influence of rival India in . Afghanistan. The belief that Pakistan supports the insurgents is widely . held in Afghanistan. Pakistani fighter jets bombed the hideouts of two militant commanders along the Afghan borderrecently, killing up to 31 insurgents. One of those killed was reported to be a Pakistani Taliban leader in the Orakzai region, Moin ud Din. The strikes followed clashes between soldiers and militants over a strategic mountain in Kurram last week, in which more than 60 people were killed. In recent years, the Pakistani military has launched a series of offensives against militants in the border regions - which are only nominally controlled by the central government. Large areas remain under the effective control of extremists, who use the region to plan attacks in Pakistani cities and Afghanistan. Gunmen also attacked a Pakistan paramilitary checkpoint in the Marwah area of Baluchistan province last night, killing six troops. And the bodies of seven unarmed men were discovered near the checkpoint. Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina . Rabbani Khar on a one day visit to the Afghan capital Kabul, dismissed . the claims which she said were not new and could be disregarded. 'This is old wine in an even older . bottle. I don’t think these claims are new. These claims have been made . for many, many years,' she said. In Brussels, a Nato official said the . prisoners also claimed that the Taliban retain wide public support . throughout Afghanistan, particularly in the countryside. The official, however, cautioned that . the document was not based on any intelligence analysis of the situation . on the ground, but is a summary of thousands of interrogation reports. 'It's a very lopsided perspective because some of them are motivated to portray the picture in their favour,' said the official. The extent of Taliban support from . within local forces was underlined yesterday when an Afghan soldier shot . and killed a Nato service member in southern Afghanistan. It was the sixth report since December . of an Afghan soldier turning his weapon on the international troops . working to train the Afghan security forces. Two weeks ago, an Afghan soldier . killed four French soldiers prompting President Nicolas Sarkozy to speed . up the exit of French troops from Afghanistan said it would ask Nato to . hand over all combat operations to Afghan forces in 2013 instead of by . the end of 2014. At least seven British soldiers have . been killed by so-called trusted 'colleagues' while there have been at . least 35 attacks on international troops since 2007 by Afghan soldiers, . police or insurgents wearing their uniforms. The number rose sharply . last year to 17, up from six in 2010. Tory MP John Baron, a member of the . Foreign Affairs Committee and a long-term opponent of the Government's . policy on Afghanistan, said: 'This confirms what a number of us have . suspected for some time. 'The Taliban insurgency is intact, it . is supported by local people and it is getting help from the Pakistani . intelligence services. This proves that the Taliban will not be beaten . and recent offers of talks should be positively responded to and taken . up by the U.S. and UK. 'It is possible to talk and fight at the same time - we proved that in Northern Ireland.' Mr Baron, who believes it is vital to . find a political solution in Afghanistan, said the military campaign had . become bogged down in 'mission creep' because it did not have clear . goals.","ISAF troops will retain a 'supporting' role .

Two Oklahoma men suspected in a Good Friday shooting rampage that left three people dead and terrorised Tulsa's African-American community appeared in court today and had bond set at more than $9 million each. Jake England, 19, and Alvin Watts, 32, appeared via closed-circuit television from jail. Both are being held on suspicion of three counts of first-degree murder, two counts of shooting with the intent to kill and one count of possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. They will be formally charged at a later date. Neither man had an attorney present on Monday. The judge set bond at $9.16 million apiece and scheduled their next appearance for April 16. Charged: Jake England, 19, (left) and Alvin Watts, 32, (right) are charged with murdering three people and wounding two others in a series of random shootings that allegedly targeted black people . Police have identified both suspects . as white, while all five victims in the early Friday shootings were . black. Police and the FBI cautioned that it was too early to say whether . the attacks in Tulsa's predominantly black north side were racially . motivated. Police spokesman Jason Willingham said that based on Facebook . postings attributed to England, a wish to avenge the death of his . father Carl England might have been a factor. On Thursday, two years after Carl England was killed, England took to Facebook to rage about the . 'f****** n*****' who shot his father to death. England . wrote on his Facebook wall: 'Today is two years that my dad has been . gone shot by a f****** n****** it's hard not to go off.' He also mentioned Sheran Wilde, 24, his girlfriend and the mother of his young son, who committed suicide in January. 'between . that and sheran I'm gone in the head. RIP. Dad and sheran I. Love and . miss u. I think about both of u every second of the day,' he wrote on . his public Facebook profile. Later that night, England and Watts drove . through black neighborhoods in northern Tulsa in a white pickup truck . and gunned down five strangers near the spot where England's father . died, according to police. 'It's apparent from the posting on . the Facebook page that he had an ax to grind, and that was possibly part . of the motive,' Willingham said. 'If you read the Facebook post and see . what he's accused of doing, you can see there's link between the two of . them.' Racist tirade: The day before the Good Friday shootings, Jake England against the 'f****** n*****' who shot and killed his father Carl England . The Facebook page had been taken down by Sunday afternoon. A family friend, Susan Sevenstar, . told The Associated Press that England was 'a good kid' and 'a good, . hard worker,' who 'was not in his right mind' after losing his father . and his fiancée. 'If anybody is trying to say this is a . racial situation, they've got things confused,' said Sevenstar, who . described England as Cherokee Indian. 'He didn't care what your colour . was. It wasn't a racist thing.' The Tulsa World reported that . England's father, Carl, was shot in the chest during a scuffle with a . man who had tried to break into his daughter's apartment. The man charged in the shooting is serving a six-year sentence on a . weapons charge, according to Department of Corrections records. On April 5, 2010, Carl England, 47, . showed up at the apartment complex where his daughter lived with her . boyfriend. The boyfriend had gotten into a fight with Pernell Jefferson, 40, . and had hit him with a baseball bat, the Tulsa World reported at the . time. Jefferson, who had been in prison on . drug and weapons charges, then tried to break into the couple's . apartment but left, saying he planned to 'settle the dispute.' Home: The house of shooting suspects Alvin Watts and Jake England at 2800 E 61st St. North, in Turley, Oklahoma . England . and his daughter's boyfriend went looking for Jefferson at the . apartment complex. When the found him, England hit him with a stick and . knocked him to the ground. Jefferson pulled out a gun and shot England in the chest, the World reported, killing him. Carl . England was killed at 3608 N. Quaker Ave. in northern Tulsa. All of the . Good Friday shootings occurred within four miles of the apartment . complex where he died. Most were much closer. On Sunday, acting on an anonymous tip and backed . by a helicopter, police followed England and Watts from the home they . shared in Turley, just north of Tulsa, and arrested them without incident, police . said. Task force commander Maj. Walter . Evans said investigators recovered a weapon but that it was not clear . who fired the shots. They also found a truck that had been burned. The Rev. Warren Blakney Sr., . president of the Tulsa NAACP, said the arrests came as a relief. Racially motivated: Tulsa NCAAP president Rev Warren Blakney Sr said the shooters appeared to be clearly targeted black people . Gunned down: Carl England was killed by an ex-convict after a fight at his daughter's apartment complex April 5, 2010 . 'The community once again can go about its business without fear of there being a shooter on the streets,' Blakney said. Police Chief Chuck Jordan said the . gunmen appeared to have chosen their victims at random. Four shooting victims were found in yards and the fifth in a street. Police . identified those killed as Dannaer Fields, 49, Bobby Clark, 54, and . William Allen, 31. Convict: Pernell Jefferson, 40, is serving six years in prison for killing Jake England's father, Carl . Fields was found wounded about 1am . Friday, Clarke was found in a street about an hour later, and Allen was . discovered in the yard of a funeral home about 8.30am. Minutes after Fields was found, . police found two men with gunshot wounds in another yard two blocks . away. They were taken to hospitals in critical condition but expected to . survive, police said. Their names have not been released. The shootings come at a fraught . moment for black Americans. In late February, an unarmed black teen, . Trayvon Martin, was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in . Sanford, Florida, raising questions about racial profiling and touching . off protests across the nation. While Tulsa police were reluctant to describe the shootings there as racially motivated, City Councilman Jack Henderson was not. 'Being an NAACP president for seven . years, I think that somebody that committed these crimes (was) very . upset with black people,' Henderson said. 'That person happened to be a . white person, the people they happened to kill and shoot are black . people. That fits the bill for me.' Black community leaders met on Friday as fears mounted about the attacks to calm unrest and promote safety. NAACP Tulsa president, the Rev. Warren . Blakney Sr., told the World that the shooter appeared to be 'targeting . black people to shoot.' 'I'm on edge for my people,' Blakney said as he argued that the crime was clearly racially motivated. Close proximity: The five shooting victims were found at four locations within four miles of the apartment complex where Jake England's father was killed two years ago . Troubled: Jake England (left) made posts on his Facebook page that showed he struggled with the deaths of his father and of the mother of his young son. His friend, Watts, is also his accomplice, according to police . 'When there are reports that someone systematically shot black folk, what is one left to believe?' he told reporters. On Saturday, police chief Chuck Jordan . described the shootings as 'vicious and cowardly' as he warned the . gunmen: 'We're coming for you.' England's . Facebook wall posts show a troubled, angry young man struggling to . raise his young son and cope with the loss of his father and his . girlfriend. After the . shootings, he wrote: 'People talking s*** on me for some s*** I didn't . do... I do believer (sic) it just mite be the time to call it quits... if something does happen tonite be ready for another funeral later.' Police are waiting for the results of forensic . tests to determine scientific links between the shootings. Police Capt. Steve Odom said in his . 30 years with the police department, he'd never seen so many shootings . happen in such a short time. Crime scene: William Allen, 31, was found in the yard of this funeral home many hours after he was gunned down. His wife says he was walking home from his brother's house . Walker said detectives interviewed people Friday afternoon in the neighborhoods where the shootings happened and believe a white man driving a white pickup truck may have been involved. At least one victim said a shooter stopped his target to ask for directions before opening fire. Allen, who was walking home from his brother's house, had narrowly avoided death once, when he was badly injured in a car crash. His family never expected his life to end violently. 'Why? Why did this happen? What was the reason? What was the motive?"" his wife Jeanette, asked the World. 'He was sweet, caring... my lover. He always tried to make people laugh.' Tulsa City Councilor Jack Henderson urged people to be cautious but not let 'some crazy, deranged person mess up their weekend.' 'There's no need to become a vigilante,' Henderson said, adding that he has been assured police are working on the case as a '24/7 round-the-clock deal.'","Jake England, 19, and Alvin Watts, 32, both white, arrested 48 hours after the Good Friday shootings .

The unit's losses were in addition to claims by market makers Knight Capital Group Inc and Citadel Securities, which each had losses of $30 million to $35 million.

Tumbling: Citigroup lost around $20m during Facebook's botched IPO, a source says . That sinking feeling: UBS lost around $30m in Facebook's IPO . Nasdaq asked firms to detail estimates of losses by Monday night.

UBS AG had trading losses of around $30 million stemming from Facebook Inc's botched initial public offering on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc's U.S. exchange, a source with knowledge of the situation said, also on Friday. UBS was one of four main market makers involved in Facebook's IPO on May 18. Its losses come on top of claims by Citigroup's market making unit of $20 million, and Knight Capital Group Inc and Citadel Securities of $30 million to $35 million each in losses. Claims by four of Wall Street's main market makers against Nasdaq over Facebook's botched IPO are likely to exceed $100million, as they and other traders continue to deal with thousands of problems with customer orders.

Four of the top market makers in the Facebook IPO - Knight Capital, Citadel Securities, UBS AG and Citi's Automated Trading Desk - collectively have probably lost more than $100million from problems arising from the deal, said a senior executive at one of the firms. Knight and Citadel are each claiming losses of $30million to $35million, potentially overwhelming a $13 million fund the exchange set up to deal with potential claims. Nasdaq also has to contend with the outside prospect that it could lose the Facebook listing entirely after having just obtained it. Facebook shares ended regular trading on Thursday up 3.2 per cent at $33.03, about $5 short of their offering price. Mishap: A technical glitch at Nasdaq delayed Facebook's market debut by 30 minutes on Friday and many client orders were delayed, giving some investors and traders significant losses as the stock price dropped . Zucked: Mark Zuckerberg saved $174 million by cashing out tens of millions of shares of Facebook stock early Friday when the price was above $38 a share . Action on the stock, however, has essentially become secondary to the fallout from the IPO - its price, its size, its execution and questions about selective disclosure of its financial prospects. Regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin are now looking into how the IPO was handled. The U.S. Senate Banking Committee is also reviewing the matter. Under exchange rules, Nasdaq's liability regarding client losses from certain trading issues is limited to $3 million a month. Market makers will be arguing that Nasdaq was so grossly negligent that its actions during the IPO opening override the limits, said a source with knowledge of Knight's situation. Other firms said they did not have similar problems to those of Knight, raising questions about the scope of the losses. 'The problems were where people were trying to cancel orders; we didn't have that,' said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York. 'Because we didn't have a problem doesn't mean there weren't problems.' E*Trade Financial Corp said its market making operations realized losses of 'well under a million dollars.' Charles Schwab Corp had a 'small number' of the 'tens of thousands of clients' who traded Facebook whose issues still have not been resolved, a spokesman said. 'Each one requires some analysis to resolve, which can be time consuming.' Shares of Nasdaq fell 1 cent to $21.80 on Thursday. As of Thursday's close the stock was down 5.2 per cent from its last close before the Facebook debacle. Over the same period NYSE Euronext is down just 0.1 per cent.

Predator: Alberto Flores Ramirez, 36, was charged with rape after luring a woman to a California motel room to perform a raw egg cleanse . A spiritual healer has been charged with rape and sexual assault after luring a woman to a motel room to perform a raw egg cleanse treatment. Alberto Flores Ramirez, 36, allegedly met his victim through a chat and dating website. Ramirez, of Santa Clemente, California, embarked on an online relationship with the 33-year-old woman from Mexico who is in the U.S. on a tourist visa with her son. Her two daughters remained in Mexico with a man who is not her husband but has custody of the children. Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna told MailOnline that Ramirez had convinced the woman he could 'spiritually cleanse her', making it possible for her two girls to come to America. After chatting to Ramirez on the website Badoo, she agreed to meet him at a McDonald's restaurant in Santa Ana on April 3. They then drove to the Aloha Motel around 6pm to begin the treatment - a healing art which cleanses a person's spiritual aura by running an egg over the body to release negative energies. Egg cleansing is common throughout central and south America, but is not widely known in the U.S. After performing the cleanse once, Ramirez told the victim she still had 'bad vibes' and to remove her clothes. He then reportedly rubbed raw eggs on the victim’s body and fondled her, according to a report by the District Attorney's office. When the victim attempted to cover herself with the comforter from the bed, Ramirez is accused of jumping on top of the victim and restraining her. He then raped the woman and threatened her life. After she escaped, she contacted police and took part in a sting to catch Ramirez - who is believed to be in the U.S. illegally. Cultural practice: Although it is not widely known in the U.S., the raw egg cleanse is commonly used as a spiritual healing treatment in Latin America . He was lured to a meeting point after text messages were sent by the woman and detectives were able to make an arrest. Ramirez has been charged with one . felony count each of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, and sexual . penetration with foreign object by force. If convicted, he faces a . maximum sentence of 12 years in state prison. Ramirez is being held on $100,000 bail and was expected to be arraigned today at 3pm local time.

After winning gold at the cycling world cup, millions of TV viewers watched as Joanna Rowsell threw off her helmet and stood proudly on the podium to collect her medal. With her bald head uncovered, the 23-year-old Olympic hopeful had no idea she would become an overnight ‘poster girl’ for alopecia sufferers. Indeed, after losing her long auburn locks aged just ten, she spent years covering her hair loss under hats and wigs. But after finding her confidence . through top-level cycling, she now feels at ease with her condition. In . fact, she credits the alopecia for creating the determined and tough . young woman she is today. Speaking . from her family home in Cheam, Surrey, and wearing her ‘every day’ wig, . she said last night: ‘Now, I cannot imagine my life if I had not had . alopecia. I don’t know what route I would have taken. ‘It scares me to think I would not have found cycling. ‘The alopecia made me very shy so I stayed in and intensely focused on my homework or that A* in an exam. ‘Working hard was the only thing that . stopped me from worrying about the future, about whether I would get a . boyfriend or how I would face getting a job with strangers. ‘Then . cycling came along and I applied the same work ethic. I worked through . any worries I had about my hair and I focused solely on that. It made me . who I am.’ The first signs of the condition came . at the age of nine when the hair in one of Miss Rowsell’s eyebrows fell . out. Within months, she had developed bald patches on her scalp and she . began to lose eyelashes. She said: ‘I was gutted. I had been a girl who loved having my long hair in plaits. ‘I remember crying one night to my parents and asking why it was happening. They said they would find someone to fix it.’ Despite seeing numerous doctors, her . parents, bank worker Roger, 52, and school accounts manager Amanda, 52, . were told that the alopecia was incurable. Alopecia occurs when the immune system . becomes confused and attacks the body’s hair follicles. This causes the . hair to fall out leaving bald patches that can eventually spread across . the entire head. Acceptance: Joanna Rowsell has had alopecia . areata since she was 10. She currently only has a few patches of hair on . her scalp and decided to opt for the occasional wig when she turned 20 . Deterioration: At age 9 with her treasured long hair but one eyebrow missing, by age 11 the alopecia has fully set in . Miss Rowsell said: ‘It was hard being a . teenager and having alopecia. I didn’t bother with make-up or clothes . because I didn’t want to think about my appearance.’ She credits cycling with boosting her . confidence. At 15, she was scouted by the British cycling talent team . when they visited her school in Sutton, Surrey. At the time she had no interest in . cycling and only owned an old push bike which was rusting in the back of . her parents’ garage. But they spotted raw talent and she began . training. Triumph: Silver medalist Alison Shanks of New Zealand, gold medalist Joanna Rowsell of Great Britain and bronze medalist Amy Cure of Australia celebrates on the podium following the Women's Individual Pursuit Final during the UCI Track Cycling World Cup . Record-breakers: Joanna on the podium without a wig with Danielle King (left) and Laura Trott (centre) following their impressive win on Friday . Determination: Joanna cycles her way to victory in the Women's Individual Pursuit at the Olympic Velodrome on Saturday . 2009 and gold in the . European Track Championships in 2011. Last weekend, she was part of the team . pursuit trio which won gold at the UCI World Cup with a record-breaking . time of three minutes, 18.148 seconds. She then had her own win in the . individual pursuit against former world champion Alison Shanks from New . Zealand. And she was happy to go without her wig on the podium. She said: ‘I literally only had time . to wipe the sweat off my face and jump on the podium. If I have time, I . will put on one of my wigs because everyone likes to look their best, . but I will also go without.’ She bought her first wig from Selfridges at the age of 20. ‘I suppose I . wanted to feel “normal” and attractive on nights out,’ she said. ‘I didn’t want to look silly, but it was . like being in disguise, I loved it. I chose a long black curly wig. Now . I have three, including a long blonde one. It is fun to experiment.’ Relaxed: Joanna, left, pictured with a wig, but she doesn't always get time to put one up before the winners' photographs are taken . At the age of 16, her hair grew back – something she credited with her happiness from cycling. She was, she says, ‘over the moon’, but six months later she was devastated when it fell out and she had to go through the trauma of losing hair again. At 20, it grew back for a third time, but lasted one month. It could not have come at a worse time, having just met her first and current boyfriend. She said: ‘I was so worried when it fell out again that he wasn’t going to like me, but he wasn’t bothered at all.’ Now, she is philosophical about her condition. She said: ‘Much worse things happen in life than losing your hair. I am happy and healthy. Now I want to focus on the things that matter – like getting that gold medal at the Olympics.’ For further information on alopecia visit Alopecia UK's website .","Joanna Rowsell has alopecia areata - a condition where the immune system attacks the hair follicles .

A national crackdown on prescription drug abuse has led to new wave of heroin users in America. It used to be easier to forge a prescription than meet with a dealer on a street corner. But since stricter rules on prescription drugs were imposed youngsters are choosing heroin as a drug of choice. The deadly drug is now being found in areas where previously, it hadn't presented a problem. New York, Pennsylvania, North and South Carolina, Illinois and Missouri have all been affected by the surge in abuse according to 2011 Justice Department statistics. The burgeoning popularity of the narcotic has also been blamed on expensive prescription drugs. New York Daily News reports that drug companies are creating painkillers such as Oxycontin and Tylenol can cost between $30 and $80 a pill, whereas at around $10 heroin is much cheaper. The Justice Department believe that heroin entering The States is coming from over the boarder in Mexico. Heroin production in Mexico is now second only to Afghanistan and more sophisticated transport . of the drug throughout the American Southwest Border has meant the it is more available than ever before. On the East Coast authorities have reported a sharp increase in Mexican-sourced 'blacktar' heroin - a brown morphine derivative - in places where only purer 'white powder' had been seen. They warn that new heroin users are more likely to die since their bodies are unaccustomed to the side-effects of the drug. Increased overdoses have been reported in 60 U.S. counties in at least 30 states. Poppy cultivation in Mexico is now second only to Afghanistan . But it's not just prescription drug addicts that are making the switch to heroin. Cocaine users are also choosing to to use it because of low availability of their preferred substance. But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prescription painkillers are still killing more people than heroin. In 2009 non-medical use of pharmaceuticals or dietary supplements caused more than 1.2million visits to the emergency room while heroin was involved in 213,118. The prescription drugs of choice for over half of patients were opiate/opioid analgesics such as hydrocodone and oxycodone.",Widespread availability of the narcotic has been blamed on Mexico's prolific poppy cultivation .

A video camera that was meant to capture a man’s sleep patterns instead recorded the final hours before he died and cost him his life, according to the 25-year-old’s family. Brandon Harris, who was mentally disabled, had been referred by his doctor to the Emory Sleep Center in Atlanta to determine whether he suffered from obstructive sleep apnea, a condition which causes difficulties in breathing. But his family had allegedly voiced concerns about the study, saying that it was risky for Brandon to lie on his back for long periods of time because he was overweight and suffered from congestive heart failure, diabetes and high blood pressure. Scroll down for video . Dead: Brandon Harris' routine sleep study instead recorded the last few hours of the 25-year-old's life . In the footage obtained by MyFoxAtlanta, Harris can be seen waving his hand in distress and calling out, ‘Am I dying?’ - but by the time sleep technologists attended to him it was too late. Brandon collapsed and died before he reached the hospital during the test in January 2010. His death has since prompted a wrongful death lawsuit and a new bill forcing tougher regulations on Georgia’s sleep centres, such as 24-hour staffing, defibrillators being placed in each room and CPR training for sleep technologists. ‘We think that the people who his care was entrusted to should have acted quicker and they should have acted better to save his life,’ Senator Vincent Fort told MyFoxAtlanta. In distress: Brandon can be seen waving his hand in distress during the last few hours of his life . Concern: Brandon can be seen sitting up during the sleep study footage . ‘He said, ""Am I dying?"" Brandon knew that he was in a situation that was life-threatening. They should have done more than just reassure him that he was okay. They should have done the things necessary to save his life.’ Brandon Harris' mother Renee Sunshine Lewis said his death could have been prevented. 'I hope through this legislation no other person, no other mother will have to hurt as bad as I have. And that Brandon's death will save other lives,' she said. Location: Brandon had been referred by his doctor to the Emory Sleep Center in Atlanta for a sleep study that could help establish whether or not he had obstructive sleep apnea . Emory Healthcare, the largest healthcare provider in Georgia, would not comment on the bill because of the ongoing lawsuit. But last year it claimed that Harris died of sudden cardiac death and called his care 'appropriate' for his medical condition.

But although the General Medical Council found failings in 11 aspects of her work, she was allowed to carry on working on NHS patients under supervision.

A group of victims have now received £1.2million in compensation from the hospital. The GMC has ended Miss Markandoo's career after a report showed she had 'an exceptionally poor standard of medical knowledge and skills'. A 'fitness to practice' panel in Manchester heard that medical assessors checking her performance last October decided she had got worse since 2007. Victim: Diane Greenman was one of the many women who suffered botched breast operations . Panel chairman Patrick Conway told her: 'They indicated that your performance was so poor that it did not reach the level of a newly-qualified doctor. 'The panel has serious concerns about the wide-ranging and basic deficiencies in your medical knowledge and clinical skills.' He added: 'The panel has received overwhelming evidence that you demonstrated unsafe practice during your performance assessment and that you would be a risk to patients if you were to resume clinical practice.' Sheila Jeffrey, 54, from Cudworth, near Barnsley, who was permanently scarred after breast surgery, said : 'It is a disgrace it has taken so long to ban her, but I am pleased she cannot hurt anyone else. 'I wonder how many people she has hurt in the meantime. 'They could have been spared the pain and agony, physically and mentally, if they had acted the first time. 'What was the intelligence behind letting that woman continue to work?' She said the consultant had ruined her life. 'I am still in a lot of pain and take painkillers every day.

And now it has been announced that Mr Bolaris, who presented weather . forecasts at Philadelphia Fox affiliate WTXF for four years, has lost his job. A Fox spokeswoman told the Philadelphia Daily News: 'We mutually agreed that it was time to part ways'. Storm coming: John Bolaris, who's been handling weather forecasts at Philadelphia Fox affiliate WTXF for four years, was fired this week after a series of mishaps . Fired: An interview with Playboy magazine would seal the weatherman's fate, costing him his job after four years with the network . Mr Bolaris' troubles started with a vacation to Miami Beach two years ago that turned into a story ripped right out of the Hangover films. In March 2010, the four-time Emmy winner was at a bar schmoozing with fans when he was seduced by two Eastern European women. He told the Daily News that he woke up the next morning in a taxi, unable to recall what had happened the night before. When he confronted the women that day, they took him out again, and, for a second time, he woke up unable to remember what happened. Fall from grace: The four-time Emmy winner has been fired after a run-in with Eastern European scammers in Miami . Mr Bolaris knew he had been drugged, but didn’t realize the extent until days later, when his credit card company called him to report he had charged more than $43,000 on alcohol, expensive food and an absurd painting of a woman's head. He later testified about the ordeal before a grand jury, which led to the arrest of 17 members of an Eastern European crime ring. But the trouble was far from over, after he sat down with Playboy magazine for an interview about the 'Bar Girls' scam last year. The veteran meteorologist also got into a tiff with management several months ago after they refused to let him interview his friend, disgraced baseball star Lenny Dykstra. But it was the sit-down with the men's magazine that would seal his fate. The interview presented Mr Bolaris as an out-of-town boozehound who followed the women because he was looking to 'get laid'. He also mentioned to Playboy that one of his favourite pastimes was to 'watch football naked with my lady and a bottle of wine.' He added: 'Then, the next morning, make breakfast for her, turkey Hot Pockets with egg whites in the microwave'. Morning after havoc: 'The Hangover' films followed the exploits of three friends trying to piece together the night before . His bosses at WTXF did not appreciate the extra information about himself, and though Mr Bolaris denied saying anything of the sort, he was suspended from the network last month. He would never see the weather studio again.","John Bolaris fell victim to Eastern European scammers, who drugged him and took him for more than $43,000 in Miami .

A former soldier who served in Afghanistan may have shot his landlady to . experience what it was like to kill someone, a court was told . yesterday. Aaron Wilkinson, who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress after his . tour of duty, blasted mother-of-two Judith Garnett, 52, to death at . point-blank range. He had become ‘obsessed’ with his six months in Afghanistan, where he . suffered a minor wound but ‘seemed disappointed at not having fired a . shot’ there, jurors were told. Suspect: Soldier Aaron Wilkinson is on trial for murder after shooting dead his boss, farm owner and mother-of-two Judith Garnett, with a shotgun . The 24-year-old ‘was desperate to see what it was like to shoot someone – . something he had not managed to achieve in Afghanistan’, it was . alleged. He told police he went ‘crazy’ when Mrs Garnett, who was also . his employer, told him he was ‘lazy, thick and cruel’ and ordered him to . move out of her house in Leeds, where he had lived rent-free, Bradford . Crown Court heard. After shooting the widow, killing her instantly, Wilkinson dialled 999 . and told the operator: ‘I have done something absolutely terrible... I . just had a moment of madness.’ Richard Mansell, QC, prosecuting, said Wilkinson served in Afghanistan . in 2009, and ‘was proud of the fact that he had been injured’ and . carried around in a jar the piece of shrapnel that struck him. He claimed to have been one of a group investigated by military police . over an incident in which Afghan civilians had been killed. He became ‘animated’ when talking about guns and would hold a shotgun as if it were an army rifle. Mr Mansell added: ‘He spoke about the fact that he had not managed to . kill any enemy soldier while in action and seemed disappointed.’ A possible reason for the killing  was Wilkinson’s ‘fascination with . guns and killing and a desire to see what it was like to shoot someone’.

In suede jacket, checked shirt and smart loafers, the grey-haired gentleman walking down the street is a picture of well-to-do respectability. A few paces ahead, with cropped hair, tattoos and jogging pants, is a young man who looks like life has dealt him a somewhat tougher hand. But although they appear to come from opposite ends of the social spectrum, this is, in fact, father and son. The older man is Lord Brabourne, 64, grandson of Earl Mountbatten of Burma, childhood friend of the Prince of Wales and godson of the Duke of Edinburgh. Family stroll: Lord Barbourne and his son Nicholas walking in London's Kings Road this week . Slightly ahead of him and chatting on a mobile phone, is his son, the Honourable Nicholas Knatchbull, 30 –  also known as  Lord Romsey – who has fought a long battle with crack cocaine and heroin. Over the years, the distance between them has been much greater than the few paces that separated them in a London street earlier this week. In the darkest days of Nicholas’s drug addiction, there was talk of his parents disinheriting him. They were said to be worried about leaving Broadlands, the 5,000-acre ancestral estate and 60-room stately home in Hampshire, in his care and feared he would squander the family’s £100million fortune. Then two years ago, Lord Brabourne suddenly decided to leave Broadlands, and Penny, his wife of more than 30 years, for a new life in the Bahamas with his mistress. The romance was complicated and his lover, Jeannie McWeeny, 58, the widow of baronet Sir Nicholas Nuttall, is said to have dumped him at one point. They have since been spotted back in London, where Lord Brabourne has a home in Belgravia. This week, he spent the afternoon with his son, strolling down the King’s Road and visiting the Peter Jones department store in Sloane Square. It was, perhaps, a sign of a positive development in Nicholas’s life, which despite its great privilege, has seen him struggle to beat his demons. Royal connections: Nicholas Knatchbull with his father and Prince Charles in 1998 . Nicholas was educated at Eton, where he helped mentor family friend Prince William, who was in the year below. Then he went on to Edinburgh University but dropped out after just six weeks and  descended into drug addiction. By 2009, the young heir had sunk so low that fellow junkies caught him on camera smoking crack and heroin, and sold the film to a downmarket newspaper. An expensive spell in rehab followed. Shabby though Nicholas appeared on his stroll, with his tattoo collection having grown, and dark bags under his eyes, he actually looked healthier than he has for some time. He has put on weight and seemed at ease in the company of the man he calls ‘Pops’. Like his father, Nicholas has a somewhat colourful private life. Eighteen months ago, it was revealed he was engaged to Zeaphena Badley, 29, an unmarried Anglo-Jamaican mother of two brought up on a grim south London council estate. The  state of the romance is unclear at the moment. Although his mother Lady Brabourne, a long-term confidante and carriage-driving companion of Prince Philip, reportedly disowned Nicholas after he was filmed smoking crack, his father was said to have been heartened by his son finding love. A friend told the Daily Mail in December 2010 that while Lord Brabourne may not be ‘thrilled that she may well be the next Baroness Brabourne, as long as Nicholas is going in the right direction in can only be viewed as a positive thing’. The women in his life: Lord Brabourne's wife Penny (left) and his mistress Jeannie McWeeny (right) Early days: Lord Brabourne with Lady Romsey, a nine-year-old Nicholas (middle) and his sisters Leonora (left) and Alexandra (right) And tough as it is to deal with a child’s drug addiction, Lord Brabourne has suffered enough tragedy to be able to keep it all in perspective. In 1979 he lost his grandfather Lord Mountbatten when the IRA bombed his private boat just off Ireland. His beloved younger brother Nicholas, 14, also died, as well as deckhand Paul Maxwell, 15. His grandmother, Baroness Brabourne, 83, died of her injuries the following day. When his first son was born, Lord Brabourne named him after the brother he had lost. But although so much hope was invested in Nicholas, the boy seemed destined for trouble. More tragedy hit the family when daughter Leonora died of a kidney tumour aged five in 1991. She is buried at Broadlands. The Brabournes’ other child, Alexandra, 29, a theology graduate and goddaughter of Princess Diana, has reportedly been groomed to take over the family estate when the time comes. Since Lord Brabourne deserted Broadlands, his estranged wife has taken over the running of the estate and even replaced him as the High Steward of Romsey. The daughter of a former butcher who founded the Angus Steakhouse restaurant chain, she was plain Penny Eastwood when she married into the family in 1979. The first Baron Brabourne was MP Edward Knatchbull, given the hereditary title in 1880. The family motto is ‘My glory is in the cross’.","Lord Romsey joined his father for a walk on London's Kings Road .

"The new law would jack up fines to 300,000 rubles ($9,000). 'Large-scale public gatherings' could also be banned under new legislation . By . Tammy Hughes . PUBLISHED: . 05:25 EST, 8 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:26 EST, 8 June 2012 . Intolerance: Russian President Vladimir Putin takes a hard-line against protesters . A new hard line law that will fine protesters a year's salary is awaiting President Vladimir Putin's signature. Putin has cracked down on the opposition since returning to the presidency, and he seems to be betting that by threatening demonstrators with prison time and harsh fines he can quash the street protests that have posed an unprecedented challenge to his 12-year rule. His strategy faces a major test on Tuesday when the opposition plans its first mass demonstration since he began his third presidential term on May 7. Some opposition leaders contend that . the tough line will help their cause by fueling anger and bringing more . people out for next week's protest. Others say the repression will scare . away the middle-class protesters who turned out in the tens of . thousands for peaceful demonstrations this winter. Putin, for his part, is refusing any talks with the opposition. 'He understands only one language, . the language of force, and therefore he perceives any normal discussion . and any rational compromise as personal weakness,' said Yevgenia . Chirikova, an environmental activist who has campaigned against . Kremlin-backed road construction that is destroying a forest outside . Moscow. Chirikova and Ilya Yashin, who recently spent 15 days in jail for leading unsanctioned protests, were among a group of opposition leaders who met Thursday in Moscow to discuss the implications of the new law, which would jack up fines to 300,000 rubles ($9,000). Yashin tried to ease worries, saying . protest leaders would collect donations for those punished, as was done . within hours when St. Petersburg teacher Tatyana Ivanova was fined . 30,000 rubles ($1,000) last week. Ivanova . was found guilty of damaging the reputation of an education department . official she had accused of pressuring her and other poll workers to . falsify the December parliamentary vote. Repression: Opposition leader Sergei Udaltsov, left, with environmental activist Yevgenia Chirikova tear a picture of Putin to pieces at a protest earlier this year. Dissidents could be fined a year's wages if the new law goes ahead . Russian police detain a protester near the Kremlin in Moscow on Wednesday. Street protests have posed an unprecedented challenge to Putin's 12-year-rule . The anti-Putin protests broke out after the December election, which observers said was riddled with fraud in favor of Putin's party, and continued in the run-up to the March presidential vote. As many as 100,000 people turned out in the frigid cold for demonstrations demanding free elections, and the streets of Moscow rang with cries of 'Russia Without Putin' and 'Putin Is a Thief.' Although he was denied a majority in Moscow, Putin won the election to return to the Kremlin post he had held from 2000 to 2008 before moving into the prime minister's office to avoid violating a constitutional ban on more than two consecutive terms. With the election over, the protest movement seemed to fade. But on the eve of Putin's inauguration in May, an opposition march and rally drew tens of thousands, far more than either the organisers or the police had expected. The demonstration turned violent . after police restricted access to the square where the rally was to be . held. Bottles and pieces of asphalt were hurled at police, who struck . back by beating protesters with truncheons and detaining more than 400. Some demonstrators were dragged away by their hair. Opposition leaders . claim the clash was provoked by pro-Kremlin thugs. Violence: Russian riot police try to disperse opposition protesters on May 6. New legislation would provide police with new powers against Occupy-style camps . In the days that followed, police chased opposition activists around the city, detaining hundreds. Then the crackdown eased, as the authorities allowed the opposition to set up camp on a leafy boulevard. But there were strings attached: The organisers could not put up placards or make political demands, since that would technically turn the camp into an unsanctioned protest. The authorities tolerated the camp for about a week before getting a court to rule that the activists were creating a mess in the neighborhood, giving police the legal right to disperse them. The anti-protest legislation also would provide police with new powers against such Occupy-style camps. 'Large-scale public gatherings' could be banned and the organisers fined if they disrupted public order. In a Levada poll released Thursday, 65 percent said they expected the protests to continue, although they differed on how likely the protests were to intensify or spread. The poll, conducted May 25-29 among 1,604 people across Russia, has a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points. The bill was rushed through the Kremlin-controlled parliament this week in an effort to get it in place before Tuesday's big protest. Some opposition leaders held out hope that Putin would refuse to sign it. Others, however, said they had no illusions, pointing to a comment by Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov after the violence on the eve of the inauguration. Protesters who hurt riot police, he said, 'should have their livers smeared on the asphalt.'It was the kind of language that Putin likes.","The bill was rushed through the .

Children as young as four are hitting classmates as they re-enact scenes from violent 18-rated computer games, a teacher has revealed. Parents are letting young children play on older siblings’ consoles or even buying the games for them, it was claimed. But youngsters struggle to separate reality from their experiences in the virtual world and mimic the scenes at school. A child plays Grand Theft Auto III: Ms Sharratt said children often played violent games which were rated for adults (file picture) They are also coming to lessons too tired to learn after staying up late playing computer games and falling asleep at their screens. Many children are already ‘hooked’ on their fantasy personas in games, leading increasingly ‘solitary lives’ as a result. The warning comes from Alison Sherratt, a reception class teacher at Riddlesden St Mary’s Church of England Primary in Keighley, West Yorkshire. She is due to outline her concerns to the annual conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers this week. Mrs Sherratt said pupils regularly discuss playing games such as the Call Of Duty series, set in various war zones, and Grand Theft Auto – where players carry out robberies, muggings, killings, drug deals and beat prostitutes with baseball bats. The Call Of Duty series, such as the Black Ops game, have often been cited as violent games . The Call of Duty game Modern Warfare 3 drew particular criticism for a level with parallels to the London bombing attacks . On one occasion, Mrs Sherratt saw pupils throwing themselves from a play car in slow motion and pretending blood was spurting out of them. Out of 27 children in her class, most have TVs and laptops in their bedrooms and most have use of – or personally own – a PlayStation, Xbox or Wii console. Mrs Sherratt insisted she did not wish them to be banned but is calling on her union to lobby the Government on the hazards of video games. The warning came a day after news that 14-year-old Daniel Bartlam killed his mother with a claw hammer after watching a wide range of violent video games, films and TV storylines.","Games make children 'more aggressive', says teaching leader .

The expectant father was wearing a hoodie and sported an overgrown goatee and while he was in court his black Ford Escape SUV was sat in his driveway with its hood badly dented from the accident which killed 57-year-old Clara Almazo. Hero: Clara Almazo, pictured with members of her family, died in the accident after saving her eight-year-old grandson . 'I . thought it was two cars hitting each other — it was that loud,' said Janet . Romero to the New York Post of the tragic crash that she heard while inside her home around 10pm . in West Brighton on Staten Island.

The three . family members had been returning from Holy Thursday’s Catholic mass and were . just feet away from their home. Driver: Brian McGurk fled the scene of the horrific incident but gave himself up to police several hours later . Immediately . following the horror smash Berta laid her son down on the floor and was screaming . ‘My mother, my mother!’ said Romero. ‘I asked . her where her mom was, and she said, ""Over there, over there!""'

A Colorado man who was jailed for life for killing a teenager almost two decades ago will walk free after being cleared by fresh DNA evidence. Robert 'Rider' Dewey was 33 when he went to prison for the 1994 rape and murder of 19-year-old Jacie Taylor. The 51-year-old was freed yesterday, after new testing of DNA evidence pointed to someone else as the suspect. At a court hearing yesterday, a judge dismissed charges against Dewey and declared him a free man. Dewey flashed a small smile through his trim beard. He told reporters he just wants to kick back, ride his motorcycle and spend time with his family. 'Contrary to popular belief, the world doesn't stop when you go to prison,' said Dewey, wearing glasses and with his hair in two long braids. 'There's a lot for me to catch up on.' Dewey was sentenced in 1996 to life in prison without parole after he was convicted of killing Taylor, who was found dead in her bathtub in Palisade on 4 June, 1994. DNA technology at the time gave jurors conflicting information to consider, according to news accounts at the time. At his sentencing hearing, Dewey had said there was still a killer out there. The Colorado Attorney General's Office's Justice Review Project, which reviews cases where post-conviction DNA testing could clear a person, took up Dewey's case last year. The advanced DNA tests that cleared Dewey have led to an arrest warrant being issued for Douglas Thames, who is accused of first-degree murder and first-degree sexual assault. Thames had lived near Taylor, and his DNA profile is linked to evidence found in Taylor's apartment. Thames told investigators in a prison interview that he didn't know Taylor but that his girlfriend at the time had gone to classes with Taylor at Palisade High School. Thames is already serving a life sentence for a 1989 murder in Fort Collins. On Monday, Dewey thanked his legal team and said DNA evidence should be reviewed in more old cases, noting inmates around the country have been freed by new testing. 'Who else is out there?' Dewey said. Dewey said he tried to stay positive while behind bars. 'It threw me into a dark tunnel,' he said of his conviction. His first two years in prison, he didn't make his bed. Now, he is trying to understand why people text each other on their phones instead of just talking and where he might find work as he starts over. 'There's going to be trials and tribulations out here too,' Dewey said. Dewey added he wants to ride his motorcycle but has no specific plans for where. 'As long as it's in the wind, I'm happy,' he said.","Robert Dewey was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1996 .

Embarrassing footage of the General Services Administration's now infamous $820,000 Las Vegas conference has emerged, showing employees destroying office property, downing margaritas, putting on magic shows, and frolicking with a clown. The conference made headlines this week when the Office of Inspector General published their year-long investigative . report into the Public Buildings Service's 'excessive and wasteful' 2010 training session, forcing a senior government official to resign. The footage, obtained by the Huffington Post, follows the release of a spoof video of a GSA employee named Hank Terlaje singing about the lavish party and making a joke about their high-spending office culture. Scroll down for video . Extravagant: A smoking 'angry clown', who is either a GSA employee or a professional, tells guests: 'Meetings are good to have in between breaks.' The true extravagance of the five-day team-building trip can be seen in the series of videos showing employees boasting about their designer tuxedos, before urging people to 'dispense with the notion that what's done in Vegas stays in Vegas.' In one video, conference attendees strike poses on a red carpet alongside acting GSA administrator Jeff Neely, who says: 'What's done in Vegas needs to be shared with everybody.' In another clip, a smoking 'angry clown', who is either a GSA employee or a professional, tells guests: 'Meetings are good to have in between breaks.' Attendees also performed their own renditions of Frank Sinatra's Luck Be A Lady, watched magic shows and took part in a contest to see who could blow the most bubbles through a hula hoop. 'These videos reinforce once again the complete lack of judgment exhibited during the 2010 Western Regions Conference,' Greg Mecher, a GSA spokesman, said in a statement to The Huffington Post. 'Our agency continues to be appalled by this indefensible behavior, and we are taking every step possible to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.' The . White House accepted General Services Administration chief Martha . Johnson's resignation on Monday after she dismissed two deputies and . suspended other career federal employees over the 'over the top' conference, that allegedly also featured a comedian, bicycle giveaways and lavish after-hour receptions in resort suites for federal workers. Caught on camera: A federal employee sings in a spoof music video about the costs of the Las Vegas conference . Controversial: The White House accepted General Services Administration chief Martha Johnson's resignation after she dismissed two deputies and suspended other career federal employees over the $820,000 conference . The 300-person event at the M Resort Spa and Casino in Henderson, Nevada, included $3,200 for a mind reader, $6,300 on commemorative coin sets,  and $75,000 on a training exercise to build a bicycle in 2010. It also included a $95-per-person dinner and reception as well as various violations of federal laws and policies, and costs for a clown and a comedian, according to the Washington Post. 'As the agency Congress has entrusted . with developing the rules followed by other federal agencies for . conferences, GSA has a special responsibility to set an example, and . that did not occur here,' the inspector general concluded in its report. Public Buildings Service chief Robert . Peck and Johnson's top adviser, Stephen Leeds, were forced out. Four . GSA employees who organized the five-day conference have been placed on administrative . leave pending further action, a White House official said. The . official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the . embarrassing episode within the federal agency that oversees office . space and supplies, transportation and management tasks. 'On his first day in office, . President Obama made clear that the people who serve in his . administration are keepers of the public trust and that public service . is a privilege,' White House chief of staff Jack Lew said in a . statement. Forced out: Public Buildings Service chief Robert Peck, left, and Johnson's top adviser, Stephen Leeds, right, were fired after the controversy . 'He was outraged by the excessive spending, questionable dealings with contractors and disregard for taxpayer dollars. 'He . called for all those responsible to be held fully accountable given . that these actions were irresponsible and entirely inconsistent with the . expectations that he has set as president.' The planners spent more than $136,000 on a pre-conference visit to Las Vegas, including $57 lunches, according to an internal review first reported by The Washington Post. That report also found 'redundant and wasteful' practices, such as hiring outside event planners when the agency already has in-house workers for those tasks. Those outside planners received a $12,000 commission from the resort, which the investigators said 'strongly indicates that further discounts might have been available to GSA if GSA had contracted the hotel directly.' The report also found costs that exceeded the original projections and officials who skirted federal rules that set aside some contracts for small businesses. The internal review found questionable actions, such as the event planner asking the hotel that an agency employee who arrived a day early get 'a friend of a friend of the owner rate (wink).' Another agency employee sought a discount on a $98 purse from the hotel gift shop. She received a $30 break. Luxurious: The M Resort Spa and Casino in Henderson, Nevada, where the 300-person event that included $6,300 on a commemorative coin set, and $75,000 on a training exercise to build a bicycle in 2010, took place . Plush: One of the expensive rooms in the Las Vegas hotel where the five-day conference took place . The conference also spent $75,000 for . a training exercise to assemble 24 bikes that were later donated at the . agency's direction to the Boys' and Girls' Club. Any equipment . purchased with taxpayer dollars is supposed to be sold during government . sales, but planners attempted to skirt those rules by having the . trainers claim ownership of the cycles. Planners spent $31,000 on a 'networking reception' that featured a $19-per-person 'American artisanal cheese display' and $7,000 in sushi. Taxpayers also footed the bill for $5,600 for in-room parties, $3,700 for T-shirts and almost $2,800 in water bottles. A separate cocktail reception included $1,500 for 'Boursin scalloped potato with Barolo wine-braised short ribs' and a $525 bartender fee for a cash bar. A senior official spent $2,700 entertaining other employees after the closing dinner. And three officials spent almost $400 for rented tuxedos. All of this occurred during a conference that a regional administrator directed to be '""over the top,"" bigger and better than previous conferences.' Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, called the conference a 'junket'. 'It is never appropriate for an agency to fund lavish conferences that waste tax dollars,' she said. 'This is especially true at a time when American families are struggling to put food on their own tables and the U.S. government is piling up debt at an historic pace.' 'Over the top': Taxpayers footed the bill for a $3,200 session with a mind reader amongst other lavish expenses . Unnecessary: The luxury $800,000 training conference also allegedly featured a clown . Johnson seemed to agree. 'I find the . information in your report to be very troubling as it outlines potential . violations of federal procurement laws and agency policy,' Johnson said . in a memo that accompanied the inspector general's report. The White House found out about the draft internal report in early March, and Lew and White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler investigated the conference for employees of GSA's western region. Obama later was told of the findings and demanded accountability. Johnson put in place new rules to prevent future spending, such as dealings that went around bidding rules, ignored contracting requirements and questionable expenses such as tuxedo rentals - but they were not enough to keep her in her job. 'I fell I must step aside as administrator so that the agency can move forward at this time with a fresh leadership team,' Johnson wrote in her resignation. 'Collectively, the people of GSA now must review, repair and rebuild.' Johnson served as a co-leader for the Obama transition team and previously was a vice president at 90,000-employee Computer Sciences Corporation. During the Clinton administration, she was a White House aide, an official at the Commerce Department and the chief of staff at the General Services Administration.

A U.S. official has confirmed the arrest of a fifth suspect in the Netherlands, in the copyright infringement case against file-sharing website Megaupload. Thirty-two-year-old software programmer Andrus Nomm, a citizen of Estonia and a resident of both Turkey and Estonia, could become the seventh person charged in the case against the alleged $175million piracy ring.

Denied: Megaupload boss Kim Dotcom (right) was denied bail during a hearing in Auckland, New Zealand today . News of Nomm's arrest came after a New Zealand judge denied bail today to Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom, 38. Prosecutor Anne Toohey argued at the . bail hearing, in Auckland, New Zealand, that Dotcom, also known as Kim . Schmitz, was a flight risk 'at the extreme end of the scale' because it . was believed he had access to funds, had multiple identities and had a . history of fleeing criminal charges. But his defence lawyer said the former . hacker, who is reportedly 6ft 6in tall and weighs more than 285lbs . (20st), was hardly likely to escape detection by New Zealand . immigration. 'He is not the sort of person who will . pass unnoticed through our customs and immigration lines and controls,' said lawyer, Paul Davison.

"The couple spoke about 'family stuff and reaffirmed their love for each other' lawyer said . They spoke on Wednesday with Bales at Fort Levenworth . Bales accused of killing 17 civilians, including nine children, in Afghan village . Charges come one day after second 2008 assault revealed . Was accused of 2002 assault at casino . PUBLISHED: . 08:23 EST, 24 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:26 EST, 24 March 2012 . Robert Bales faces the death penalty after being charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder . An Army staff sergeant charged with killing 17 Afghan civilians has spoken with his wife twice since he was detained. Staff Sgt. Robert Bales called his wife Karilyn Bales, first from overseas after the March 11 pre-dawn massacre, and a second time from the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, on Wednesday. Shortly after the shooting, Bales, 38, was moved out of Afghanistan. He is now being held in Fort Leavenworth. For Wednesday's call, the couple was 'given advance notice the call would be coming and that the call would be monitored. It was no more than 10 minutes. They spoke about family stuff, and reaffirmed their love for each other,' said attorney Lance Rosen. Karilyn Bales had said in a statement that she 'remains deeply grief stricken by the news reports about the night of March 11. She has no more information about what happened other than what the government and media have released.' Bales was charged yesterday with 17 counts of premeditated murder, a capital offense that could lead to the death penalty in the massacre of Afghan civilians, the U.S. military said. The 38-year-old soldier is accused of walking off a U.S. military base with his 9mm pistol and M-4 rifle, which was outfitted with a grenade launcher, before dawn on March 11, killing nine Afghan children and eight adults and burning some of the bodies. Bales, a married father of two, was on his fourth tour of duty in Iraq and had been injured his lawyers say. The charge of premeditated murder means prosecutors believe the massacre was pre planned . It was the worst allegation of . civilian killings by an American and has severely strained U.S.-Afghan . ties at a critical time in the decade-old war. It's unclear what prompted the . killings, but the case has drawn new attention to the debate over mental . health care for the troops, who have experienced record suicide rates . and high incidences of post-traumatic stress and brain injuries during . repeated deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Six other Afghans - a man, a woman and . four children - were wounded in Panjwai district of Kandahar province, . the spiritual birthplace of the Taliban. Bales also was charged with six . counts of attempted murder and six counts of assault in those cases, . according to Col. Gary Kolb, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan . who disclosed information from the charging document. Bales, a father of two from Lake . Tapps, Washington, was officially informed of the 29 charges just before . noon local time at the U.S. military prison at Fort Leavenworth, . Kansas, where he is confined. The prison is the country’s only . maximum security military prison where nearly 500 of the military’s most . notorious criminals are caged. If convicted Bales could be sharing his recreation time with Bradley Manning, the accused Wikileaks leaker. Bales was on his fourth tour of duty, having served three tours in Iraq, where he suffered head and foot injuries. The decision to charge him with premeditated murder suggests that prosecutors plan to argue that he consciously conceived the killings. A military legal official for U.S. forces in Afghanistan who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the case, noted that premeditated murder is not something that has to have been contemplated for a long time. The maximum punishment for a premeditated murder conviction is death, dishonorable discharge from the armed forces, reduction to the lowest enlisted grade and total forfeiture of pay and allowances, Kolb said. The mandatory minimum sentence is life imprisonment with the chance of parole. Tears of grief: An Afghan youth mourns for his relatives, who were allegedly killed by the U.S. service member . Horrific: The bodies of an elderly Afghan man and a child killed in the Alkozai village of Panjwayi district are shown wrapped in blankets . Legal experts have said the death . penalty would be unlikely in the case. The military hasn't executed a . service member since 1961 when an Army ammunition handler was hanged for . raping an 11-year-old girl in Austria. None of the six men currently on . death row at Fort Leavenworth was convicted for atrocities against . foreign civilians. The . charging document did not provide details about the killings, leaving . the timeline unclear. The dead bodies were found in Balandi and Alkozai . villages - one north and one south of the base. Members . of the Afghan delegation investigating the killings said one Afghan . guard working from midnight to 2 a.m. saw a U.S. soldier return to the . base around 1:30 a.m. Another . Afghan soldier who replaced the first and worked until 4 a.m. said he . saw a U.S. soldier leaving the base at 2:30 a.m. It's unknown whether . the Afghan guards saw the same U.S. soldier. If the gunman acted alone, . information from the Afghan guards would suggest that he returned to . base in between the shooting sprees. It also is not known whether the suspect used grenades, Kolb said. The grenade launcher attachment is added to the standard issue M-4 rifle for some soldiers but not all, he said. Bales was assigned to provide force protection at the base. The pre-dawn shooting spree has further frayed ties between U.S. troops and President Hamid Karzai as the two nations are negotiating agreements for America's military footprint in Afghanistan after most international combat forces withdraw by the end of 2014. After the shootings, Karzai reiterated his demand that foreign troops leave posts near Afghan villages and pull back to larger bases. The killings also have fueled anti-American sentiment in a country where violent protests raged for nearly a week last month after Muslim holy books and other Islamic texts ended up in a garbage burn pit at a U.S. base. U.S. officials are working with Afghan officials to compensate relatives of the victims, money that likely would be disbursed to the eldest male of the family. Eleven of those who died were from one family. Empty: The couple's Bonney Lake, Washington home was put on the market . for $229,000. Bales' wife and two children have been moved to Joint Base . Lewis McChord in Tacoma . Bales' lawyer, who is based in the state of Washington, has said that his client remembers very little or nothing from the time the military believes he went on the rampage. Browne told CBS' 'This Morning' on Friday that his client's memory problems predate the shooting spree. Browne said Bales had earlier suffered a 'serious' concussion that was not treated 'for a variety of reasons,' which Browne did not explain. Browne said he thinks the U.S. government will have difficulty proving its case against Bales because 'there is no crime scene' and a lack of important physical evidence like fingerprints. Bales' wife's attorney said that the family has set up a . defense fund called The Staff Sergeant Robert Bales Legal Defense Fund . to help pay legal fees. 'The legal fees and costs arising from . this matter will be astronomical.' Rosen said earlier this week. 'The . family wants Robert to get the best defense possible. They can't afford . it.' Two military defense attorneys also have been assigned to his case. Browne has said that he wants to visit Afghanistan. U.S. military officials said they would do what they can to protect Bales' legal team in the event of such a visit but warned that decisions about where the legal team could safely travel would have to be on a case-by-case basis at the time of any visit. The charges launch what is likely to be a lengthy legal process. Disarray: Boxes on the porch of Bales's home after his family was moved to a military base for their protection . Bales was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, of the 2nd Infantry Division, which is based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. The U.S. Forces-Afghanistan has sent the charges to a special court-martial convening authority, the 17th Fires Brigade, an artillery unit based in Fort Lewis, Washington. Lewis-McChord spokesman Lt. Col. Gary Dangerfield said Friday that officials at that base will have the legal responsibility of trying and managing the case against Bales, but it was not clear where the proceedings will actually take place, noting that Fort Leavenworth has the most updated security. The commanding officer of that brigade has several options ranging from taking no action to ordering an Article 32 investigation, which is comparable to a preliminary hearing or grand jury process in U.S. civilian courts. During the investigation, the defense will have an opportunity to see evidence and cross-examine government witnesses. An investigating officer will issue a report at the end of the probe in which he can recommend a court-martial; and add, delete or modify the charges. A mental assessment for Bales also is expected to be ordered. He could be charged with other offenses later, according to the legal official. On Friday, a senior U.S. defense official said Bales was drinking in the hours before the attack on Afghan villagers, violating a U.S. military order banning alcohol in war zones.","The couple spoke about 'family stuff and reaffirmed their love for each other' lawyer said .

An 11-year-old boy has gone where many of the best economic minds in Europe have feared to tread and proposed a radical solution to the euro's problems - using a pizza as his inspiration. Jurre Hermans' entry in the £250,000 Wolfson Economics Prize - an international competition to find the 'best contingency plan for a break-up of the euro' - won special mention from judges. Hermans, of Breedenbroek in the Netherlands, was 10 at the time he entered. Sorting them all out: Jurre Hermans, 11, (right) pictured here with father Julius (left) has proposed a radical solution to the euro's problems - using a pizza as his inspiration . The plan: Jurre Hermans' entry to the £250,000 Wolfson Economics Prize - an international competition to find the 'best contingency plan for a break-up of the euro' - is pictured here . He has been given a €100 gift voucher for his efforts but unfortunately failed to make the final short list of five. Hermans' suggestion was that Greeks be given drachmas in exchange for their euros and that anyone moving euros out of Greece should be penalised. He wrote: 'All Greek people should bring their euro to the bank. They put it in an exchange machine .... You see, the Greek guy does not look happy! 'The Greek man gets back Greek drachme from the bank, their old currency. The bank gives all these euros to the Greek government. 'All these euros together form a pancake or a pizza. Now the Greek government can start to pay back all their debts, everyone who has a debt gets a slice of the pizza. 'You see that all these euros in the pizzas go the companies and banks who have given loans in Greece.' Protege: Jurre Hermans was 10 at the time he entered the competition . His father Julius told CNN he was proud his son thought about the world's problems and came up with solutions. But he revealed Jurre did not want to become an economist when he was older, and would rather pursue his love of animals in becoming a zoo director. Dear Sir and Madam, . My name is Jurre Hermans. I am 10 years old and live in the Netherlands. I am quite worried about the eurocrisis and look at the TV news daily. The eurocrisis is a big problem. I think about solutions. Since I read in the newspaper about your price, I thought that I would like to submit my idea. The idea might fit. So here it is: . I made a picture of my solution and I will explain it to you. Greece should leave the Euro. How do you do that? All Greek people should bring their Euro to the bank. They put it in an exchange machine (see left on my picture). You see, the Greek guy does not look happy!! The Greek man gets back Greek Drachme from the bank, their old currency. The Bank gives all these euro's to the Greek Government (see topleft on my picture). All these euros together form a pancake or a pizza(see on top in the picture). Now the Greek government can start to pay back all their debts, everyone who has a debt gets a slice of the pizza. You see that all these euro's in the pizza's go the companies and banks who have given loans in greece(see right in my picture) Now here comes the clever part of my idea: . The Greek people do not want to exchange their Euro's for Drachmes because they know that this Drachme will lose its value dramatically. They try to keep or hide their Euro's. They know that if they wait a while they will get more Drachmes. So if a Greek man tries to keep his Euros(or bring his euros to a bank in an other country like Holland orn Germany) and it is discovered, he gets a penalty just as high or double as the whole amount in euros he tried to hide!!! In this way I ensure that all Greeks bring their euros to a greek bank and so the greek government can pay back all the debts. I hope my idea helps you!!!! Of course if a country has paid back all his debts , he can return to the eurozone. A bit more about myself: I am 10, love animals since I have a dog and a bird. I live in a family of 5 in Holland. I have 5 friends with whom I play all day, mostly outside. PS: My father helped me with my English translation as I speak Dutch . greetings from Holland, . Jurre Hermans . * all spellings sic . He also said his son wanted the euro to continue, and that he used a pizza to explain his plan because it was one of his favourite foods. His prize money, he added, will probably be spent on games in a toy shop. The competition comes as the 17-country single currency union continues to be placed under considerable strain by the crippling debt problems of some of its members. Some Europe-watchers have warned that any country's exit from the eurozone would destabilise the rest of Europe and plunge the region into a deep recession. On the other side, 'euroskeptics' argue that the currency union's problems are so great that an orderly break-up with countries going back to their old currencies, such as the Greek drachma and Italian lira, is the best answer. The prize, was has attracted 425 entries, has been sponsored by a family charity trust of Conservative peer Lord Simon Wolfson and is being run by the think tank Policy Exchange. Lord Wolfson said at the announcement of the shortlist: 'Sadly, the risk of a country leaving the eurozone has not gone away. 'The ideas contained in these entries are an invaluable contribution to tackling this important issue.' The prize's five shortlisted finalists will each receive £10,000 pounds to continue their work ahead of the prize's award on July 5. Robert Bootle and his team of Capital Economics in London said any country leaving the euro would convert its government and consumer debt into its own currency - such as the Greek drachma. The country would then deliberately default to bring its debt levels down to 60 percent of its economic output. British private investor Catherine Dobbs said the process which created the euro should basically be reversed. All claims in the exiting country would be replaced by claims in the new currency. Jens Nordvig and Nick Firoozy of Nomura Securities in London said that if a country quits the euro, British law would not recognise debt contracts in the country's new currency. A new way of handling and dealing in these debt contracts would have to be introduced. Neil Record, of Record Currency Management, said that if one country leaves the euro, the currency has to be dissolved. He thus argues for maintaining secrecy for as long as possible before announcing a breakup plan, to prevent markets from attacking structural weaknesses in other countries. And Jonathan Tepper, of North Carolina-based Variant Perception, said that as many currency unions have failed in the past a euro break-up would not be especially challenging. Using past examples as a guide, countries should exit by surprise over a weekend, declare an extra bank holiday or two around the date of the exit and stamp the existing currency until new notes are circulated. Today, the sovereign debt crisis continued to hit Europe, with stock markets failing to hold on to early gains as investors fretted about Spain's debt problems. Problems: Today, the sovereign debt crisis continued to hit Europe, with stock markets failing to hold on to early gains as investors fretted about Spain's debt problems . A disappointing set of Spanish bond auctions yesterday contributed to a big rout on global stock markets. Spain has become the latest point of concern in Europe's debt crisis as investors are concerned over the ability of the government to push through its big austerity programme at a time when its economy is heading for a return to recession and unemployment is standing at around 23 per cent. The yield on the country's 10-year bond pushed up a further 0.07 percentage point to 5.73 per cent, a sign that investors are wary of Spain's ability to avoid suffering the same bailout fate as Greece, Ireland and Portugal. 'The eurozone crisis remains unresolved and Spain remains in the spotlight with bond yields moving higher after yesterday's disappointing bond auction,' said Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital. Investors in Europe also have crucial U.S. jobs data on tomorrow on their minds. Though much of Europe is off for Good Friday, U.S. markets are open and the centrepiece during the session will be the monthly non-farm payrolls figures for March. Given that the payrolls data often set the market tone for a week or two after their release, investors are reining in their exposure. In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was down 0.7 per cent at 5,666 while Germany's DAX fell 1 per cent to 6,713. The CAC-40 in France was 1 per cent lower too at 3,281. In the current risk-averse trading environment, the euro took a further knock, trading 0.5 per cent lower at $1.3068. Wall Street was poised for further losses at the open too with both Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures down 0.3 per cent. Earlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.5 per cent to close at 9,767.61 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1 per cent to 20,593.","Jurre Hermans, now 11, entered £250,000 Wolfson Economics Prize .

Soldiers convicted of premeditated murder by a court-martial can be sentenced to death or life in prison. The four were already facing charges in civilian court. Charged: Sergeant Anthony Peden (right) and Private Isaac Aguigui (left) are led away after appearing before a magistrate at the Long County Sheriff's Office in Georgia in December. The U.S. Army yesterday announced that it too has filed murder charges against four GIs in the shooting deaths of an ex-soldier and his girlfriend . Defendants: Private First Class Michael Burnett (right) and Private Christopher Salmon, (left) have also been charged with murder . The military action comes nearly four months after fishermen found the bodies of Michael Roark, 19, and Tiffany York, 17. Both had been shot in the head before they were discovered in December not far from Fort Stewart, where Roark had served in the Army until being discharged just three days before he was killed. Brett Roark, the victim's father, said: 'If we can get the death penalty, let's go for it. This was one cold-blooded execution.' A week after the killings, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation announced it had arrested four soldiers who, like the younger Roark, served in the 4th Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart. They are jailed on the civilian charges. Sergeant Anthony Peden, 25, and Private Christopher Salmon, 25, both face charges of malice murder; Private First Class Michael Burnett, 26, and Private Isaac Aguigui, 19, are charged with being party to a murder. As the murders occurred outside the boundaries of Fort Stewart, but the suspects are all soldiers on active duty, both the civilian and military courts can claim jurisdiction. It is possible to prosecute the accused soldiers simultaneously. Cases often move more quickly through the military system. Fort Stewart Kevin Larson said the military charges against each soldier also include conspiracy to commit murder and a federal firearms charge, which the military did not immediately explain in detail. He said military and civilian authorities 'have been in discussions since the incident occurred and have cooperated with each other since the beginning'. District Attorney Tom Durden, who is leading the state prosecution, said the military charges will not necessarily influence his case. Victims: Michael Roark, 19, and Tiffany York, 17, were found shot in the head near Fort Stewart in December . Asked if he had decided whether to seek the death penalty, Mr Durden said he has yet to decide, but that 'all options are still viable'. Neither military nor civilian authorities have given a motive for the killings, or provided many details on what happened. Preliminary hearings for the four soldiers in state court were postponed earlier this month. The exact relationship between the victims and suspects remains hazy. Fort Stewart officials have said only that Michael Roark and the suspects all served in the same brigade of about 4,000 soldiers. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has said only that both victims and the four suspects all knew each other. It is also unclear why the Army discharged Roark on December 2. His service record shows he enlisted in March 2010 and trained as a cavalry scout before being assigned to Fort Stewart earlier this year. The Army Human Resources Command said only that Roark's discharge was not dishonourable. Roark's father said his son arrived at Fort Stewart last year as an eager private who was disappointed he did not get to deploy to Iraq with the 4th Brigade, which returned from a year-long tour last summer. A few months later, the young soldier complained of disagreements with superiors and told his father he wanted to leave the Army. Brett Roark said his son visited him the weekend before he was killed and did not act distressed or give any sense he was in danger.","Soldiers, who are based in Fort .

With its wild and windswept beauty, it was the perfect setting for Wuthering Heights’ story of doomed romance. ‘Make the moors never change and you and I never change,’ Cathy begs Heathcliff in a declaration of love for both him and the untamed landscape against which their passion is played out in Emily Brontë’s novel. Now furious campaigners are echoing her cry for preservation with equal fervour as they battle plans to place four 328ft high turbines right next to a hugely popular tourist trail through the rugged moor which so inspired Emily. Changing landscape: Artist impression of how the £12million scheme would look with two turbines flanking each side of the Brontë Way . The £12million scheme by private green energy firm Banks Renewables would see two turbines flanking each side of the Brontë Way on a stretch of the 43-mile footpath at Thornton Moor. This is less than five miles from Howarth, the town in West Yorkshire where Emily, her literary sisters Charlotte and Anne and their brother Branwell lived. The siblings all enjoyed the moor’s breathtaking views during their walks from the parsonage where they lived – and which is now a museum to them. Sally McDonald, chairman of the Brontë Society which maintains the museum, has condemned the proposed wind farm as ‘skyline pollution in an area of international historical interest’. Historic: The proposed wind farm is less than five miles from Howarth, the town in West Yorkshire where Emily, her literary sisters Charlotte and Anne and their brother Branwell lived . She added: ‘These moors should continue undisturbed for generations to come and for the swathes of visitors from the UK and overseas drawn to Haworth and Yorkshire by their interest in the lives and works of the Brontës. ‘The moorland hugely influenced the writing of all three sisters. Wuthering Heights was set in  and around that area.’ She said the turbines would have a ‘huge visual impact’. Councillors are due to vote on an application to install a data-gathering mast next week and objectors fear the full scheme could go to the planning committee by September and be built within 12 months. Campaigners are also concerned that the wind farm will be less than 700 yards from the nearest homes in the tiny rural settlement of Denholme Gate, where 223 people, nearly all the residents, have signed a protest petition. Mother-of-two Anthea Orchard, 34, chairman of the Thornton Moor Wind Farm Action Group, said: The damage to the landscape is going to be irreparable. It is behind a smoke screen of renewable energy. ‘We are also concerned about the impact on wildlife because of how close it is to the South Pennines Site of Special Scientific Interest. Phil Dyke, of Banks Renewables, said the proposed scheme would produce enough electricity a year for up to 4,500 homes. ‘Developing sustainable, low-carbon energy is vital to all our futures,’ he added.","Furious campaigners battle plans to place four .

Captured: Libyan authorities say they plan to put Colonel Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi on trial, and - despite requests from The Hague - have so far taken no action to hand him over . Pressure is mounting on Libya to hand over the son of former . dictator Colonel Gaddafi after the International Criminal Court issued an . official ruling calling for his surrender. Amnesty International has backed the ICC in the diplomatic tug . of war with the Libyan authorities who still want to try Saif al-Islam Gaddafi themselves. The ousted dictator's second son, once considered the heir . apparent, was finally arrested in November last year by rebel fighters in . Libya's remote southern desert while trying to flee to neighbouring Niger. He was indicted in June along with his father and the . Gaddafi regime's intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senoussi for killing and . persecuting civilians. Libyan authorities say they plan to put Saif on trial, and - . despite requests from The Hague - have so far taken no action to hand him over. In a written ruling issued yesterday, judges at the court . rejected a request by Libya to postpone handing over Saif and urged the . country’s rulers to 'comply with its obligations to enforce the arrest warrant and . proceed immediately with the surrender'. Libyan authorities have told the International Criminal . Court they plan to challenge its jurisdiction in the case and that their desire . to try Saif al-Islam inside Libya remained unchanged. Ousted: Former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi was killed in a 'mob execution' last but his son Saif al-Islam who was captured now faces trial in over war crimes in either The Hague or Libya . In a news conference Government spokesman Nasser al-Manee said: 'The justice . ministry announces that the central prison preparations have been completed. They are ready for the trial of Saif al-Islam and it will be soon.' Libyan authorities say that as soon as construction work on a special prison in Tripoli . is completed, Saif al-Islam will be moved there and that . his trial will start. The ICC says it has jurisdiction in the case and that a U.N. Security Council Resolution obliges Libya to cooperate. It has warned that . Tripoli's failure to hand Saif al-Islam over could result in it being reported . to the Council. Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the Court’s chief prosecutor, told The Associated . Press: 'The good thing here is one year ago Saif Gaddafi was threatening people . ... now he's arrested and the court is discussing his destiny.' Determined: Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the International Criminal Court¿s chief prosecutor, has warned Libya that failure to hand Saif al-Islam over could result in it being reported to the UN Council . ‘The fact that the court is ruling, and Libyans - I’m sure . they will accept it or appeal or debate it - but they will engage the court to . have it make the final decision. So that is showing how the world changes in 10 . years.' Amnesty International has echoed the ICC’s demands saying . the Libyan authorities must hand 39-year-old Gaddafi over 'without further . delay'. The organisation says that since his capture in November, . Saif al-Islam Gadaffi has been held in isolation in a secret location in the town of . Zintan without effective access to a lawyer or facilities to communicate with . his family. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi is wanted for crimes against humanity in connection . to the brutal crackdown on demonstrations ordered by his father's government. Order: Judges at the International Criminal Court rejected a request by Libya to postpone handing over Saif and urged the country¿s rulers to 'proceed immediately with his surrender' According to Amnesty, the justice system in Libya continues . to be virtually paralysed and criminal proceedings are yet to start against . thousands of detainees, held mainly outside the framework of the law and . accused of war crimes and other violations in relation to the conflict. Amnesty International Justice Team Head Marek Marczyński . said: ‘This clear ruling by the ICC judges should effectively bring an end to . the long-running saga over the fate of Saif al-Islam. ‘Libya must act on the ICC’s decision and surrender Saif . al-Islam al-Gaddafi without further delay. 'An unfair trial before a Libyan . court where the accused could face the death penalty is no way to guarantee . justice and accountability. 'The ICC has indicated that it could refer any failure of . the Libyan government to comply with the court’s ruling to the UN Security . Council. 'In the absence of a functioning Libyan court system and for . as long as the Libyan justice system remains weak and unable to conduct . effective investigations, the ICC will be crucial in delivering accountability . in Libya.' New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) also believes Saif . al-Islam would receive a fairer and safer trial in the Netherlands. Richard Dicker, HRW's international justice program director said: ‘Today's decision means that the authorities in Libya must . start making arrangements to surrender Saif al-Islam to the court.'","ICC says it has jurisdiction in the case .

During the investigation Miss Turner denied knowing Mr Price and claimed she had been holidaying in Australia. But council investigators discovered she had been making monthly transfers to Mr Price’s bank account, and had made payments to a shipping company to transport her belongings to Australia.

Affluent residents of an upmarket New York street have called for a parking ban after complaints of motorists having sex in their cars. Revellers are said to be getting frisky in vehicles and littering the area with condoms after leaving night clubs in the Chelsea district of Manhattan. And sleep-deprived tenants of $9,500-a-month apartments say a ‘controlled riot’ of ‘drugs, sex and double parking’ is unleashed on their strip on Friday and Saturday nights. Suffering: Residents of this strip of West 30th street have sent a petition to New York City Hall to ban weekend parking in a bid to stop drivers having sex in cars . They want authorities to take the unusual step of banning weekend nighttime parking on their section of of West 30th Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues. The Department of Transportation is now reviewing the proposal after the CB5 community board – a local council – voted to send a petition to City Hall. ‘There’s all kinds of problematic activity going on, like noise, violence, sexual activity and drug use,’ Raju Mann, the chair of CB5’s Transportation Committee, told the New York Post. ‘The cops are called all the time — drugs, sex, double parking, cars honking their horns, traffic blocked up,’ resident Richard Schwartz also told the newspaper. If parking was banned at weekend it would mean that any car that risked pulling over there could be towed away. At other times, the area is controlled by parking meters and residents permits – although few residents themselves have vehicles. New York is the only city in the United States where car owners are the minority. Complaints: The Parlour - one of two night clubs on the strip - has recently had a request to renew its liquor licence denied after alleged violations . And in Manhattan – its most built-up borough – only 20 per cent of residents own a vehicle. The midtown Chelsea area, which includes Madison Square Garden sports and concert venue, is a well-known night life hotspot in New York. Thousands of people travel into the district at weekends to enjoy themselves in the district’s many night clubs. Two - Rebel NYC and The Parlour - are located on the on the strip of West 30th streets where the demand for a parking ban was made. Recently, the the State Liquor Authority recently denied The Parlour’s request to renew its licence following several complaints. The bar — which is allowed to stay open pending the conclusion of the review — could be forced to close. Rocco Sergio, a manager at The Parlour, said they are now trying to work with the community.

An angry Rupert Murdoch today declared war against 'enemies' who have accused his pay-TV operation of sabotaging its rivals, denouncing them as 'old toffs and right wingers' stuck in the last century. Separate reports by the BBC and the Australian Financial Review newspaper this week claimed that News Corp's pay-TV smartcard security unit NDS had promoted piracy attacks on its international rivals. NDS and News Corp have already denied the allegations. But today the media conglomerate mounted a concerted fight back as a corruption scandal that has plagued its British newspapers began to encroach on its far more lucrative pay-TV business. On the offensive: Rupert Murdoch today mounted a concerted fight back as a corruption scandal that has plagued his British newspapers began to encroach on his far more lucrative pay-TV business . Mr Murdoch, 81, tweeted: 'Seems every competitor and enemy piling on with lies and libels. So bad, easy to hit back hard, which preparing'. His vigorous, and very public, offensive came as Australian officials said they are not investigating the report that News Corp was involved in the piracy-promoting plot aimed at crippling its competitors. 'If there's any evidence of that, then the Australian Financial Review should put it to the federal police, but we have not made a reference, the police have not received a reference,' Australian Communications Minister Stephen Conroy said today, shooting down reports that the government had called for an investigation. News Corp, whose global media interests stretch from movies to newspapers that can make or break political careers, has endured an onslaught of negative press since a phone-hacking scandal at the News Of The World blew up last year. At its height last July, Murdoch told MPs: 'This is the humblest day of my life', after meeting the family of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler whose phone News Of The World journalists had hacked. But it today appeared that Murdoch has had enough of apologising. He tweeted: 'Enemies many different agendas, but worst old toffs and right wingers who still want last century's status quo with their monopolies.' For an avowed republican such as Murdoch, describing someone as a rich and upper-class 'toff' is a damning insult. Opinionated: Rupert Murdoch often takes to Twitter to give his thoughts for the day . Accused: Rebekah Brooks (right), the former editor of The Sun and News Of The World, has been on bail since last summer when she was arrested on suspicion of phone-hacking and corruption . The BBC has a long history of . ideological clashes with BSkyB, which is 39 per cent owned by News Corp, . and both Rupert and his son James Murdoch have publicly attacked the . Corporation over the years. The Australian Financial Review is owned by Fairfax Media, the main rival to Murdoch's News Ltd newspaper group in Australia. James Murdoch sits on the board of NDS, which News Corp and co-owner private equity firm Permira agreed to sell for $5billion to Cisco this month. He is also non-executive chairman and former CEO of BSkyB. The younger Murdoch has been criticised for not uncovering the scale of phone-hacking at the News Of The World, though he had not yet joined the newspaper operation when the hacking took place. He has since moved to New York after being promoted within News Corp to deputy chief operating officer, and has severed all ties with the British newspapers. His focus is now the company's international pay-TV operations, where he made his career. Chase Carey, News Corp's COO and James Murdoch's immediate boss, issued a statement last night in which he condemned both the BBC Panorama documentary and other media worldwide who had reported its claims. He said: 'The BBC's Panorama program was a gross misrepresentation of NDS's role as a high quality and leading provider of technology and services to the pay-TV industry, as are many of the other press accounts that have piled on - if not exaggerated - the BBC's inaccurate claims'. NDS has complained that it was not asked for its side of the story before Monday's Panorama, which claimed NDS had leaked secret codes that allowed rampant pirating of BSkyB rival ITV Digital, which went bust in 2002. Separate reports by the BBC and the Australian Financial Review newspaper this week claimed that News Corp's pay-TV smartcard security unit NDS had promoted piracy attacks on its international rivals . On Thursday, NDS's Executive Chairman . Abe Peled published a detailed letter to Panorama accusing the . documentary of using manipulated emails to support its allegations, and . demanding that the program retract the claims. The BBC said: 'We stand by the Panorama investigation. We have received NDS's correspondence and are aware of News Corp's rejection of Panorama's revelations. 'However, the emails shown in the program were not manipulated, as NDS claims, and nothing in the correspondence undermines the evidence presented in the program.' Also this week, the Australian Financial Review published a story claiming that NDS had allowed piracy to thrive at its client U.S. satellite broadcaster DirecTV, which Murdoch had ambitions to buy, even though it had a fix. It reported that NDS ran a secret unit in the mid-1990s to sabotage its competitors. The stories were the result of a four-year investigation by investigative reporter Neil Chenoweth, who has written two books about Murdoch. Michael Stutchbury, the Australian Financial Review's editor-in-chief, said today: 'We fully stand by our reports in the paper and by Neil Chenoweth's extraordinary investigation. 'We are not motivated in any way by any desire to damage any financial rival to the company that runs the Financial Review. We are simply following the story and publishing what we have uncovered.' None of the evidence presented by Panorama and the AFR this week suggests that the Murdochs or any other News Corp executives were aware at the alleged practices at NDS. NDS has won several court cases brought by rivals accusing it of promoting piracy, while others have been dropped - in one case because News Corp bought a subsidiary from the rival, Vivendi, which at the time was struggling with debt. News Corp made $3.8billion in revenues and $232million in operating profit from satellite TV in its last fiscal year. It does not detail financial results for its newspapers but its UK titles bring in less than 3 per cent of group profit.","News Corp boss, 81, takes to Twitter to launch savage attack on his critics .

So imagine the confusion at a game where all 22 footballers, as well as the referee, linesman and substitutes were all called Bungay. The match played, at Bungay Town FC, near Lowestoft, north Suffolk, yesterday, is believed to have set a world first because of the team's shared surnames. No name calling: Every footballer was called Bungay and the charity was played at Bungay Town FC, near Lowestoft, north Suffolk . That's my name: More than 50 Bungays travelled from all over the country and from as far away as Australia - they either took part in the kickabout or went to cheer on the sides as they raised cash for the Jack and Ada Beattie Foundation . The footballers did not let their common ground hold them back - the astonishing clash boasted 12 . goals, a controversial sending off, two penalties, a pint-sized goal . scorer and a dramatic last-minute equaliser. More than 50 Bungays travelled from all over the country and from as far away as Australia and America to play the charity match. The Bungays either took part in the kickabout or went to cheer on the sides as they raised cash for the Jack and Ada Beattie Foundation. The London-based organisation supports vulnerable people. The small army of Bungays took in it turns to take to the pitch in either red or blue shirts as they played in a keenly-fought clash. Game on: The astonishing clash also boasted 12 goals, a controversial sending off, two penalties, a pint-sized goal scorer and a dramatic last-minute equaliser . Shaun Cole, who organised the charity game and is on non-league Bungay FC's committee, said: 'It was an amazing game. 'It had everything - it could not have gone any better' Shouted on by a crowd of very personal Bungay supporters, the players on both sides, made up of Bungays of all ages and both sexes, served up a treat at the Maltings Meadow ground. Bungay is a historic Suffolk market town, situated in a loop of the beautiful river Waveney. It has historic attractions including the ruins of Bigod's Castle, the ancient Buttercross - where a market is held each Thursday, and the old Borough well. The origin of the name of Bungay is thought to derive from the Anglo-Saxon title 'Bunincga-haye'. It is thought to represent the land belonging to the tribe of Bonna, a Saxon chieftain. As well as the players, the referee was John Bungay, of Eastleigh, Hants, while the on-call doctor was Dr Kate Bungay, from nearby Beccles. Tempers flared as the ref sent off his cousin, goalkeeper Chris Bungay, a retired trucker who had flown in from Australia to make his name in the match with a difference. His dismissal also made football history as instead of the red card he was shown the blue card, blue being Bungay FC's colours. Red-faced Chris said: 'I am sick as a parrot. 'I did nothing wrong!'There was further controversy as the blue side were awarded two last-minute penalties to make it 6-6. Tricky . striker, Manchester United fan Keiran Bungay, 15, was voted man of the . match and he told the crowd: 'Thanks for the support guys.' Other . notable Bungays were tiny hotshot Owen Bungay, six, of Northolt, . north-west London, and Todd Bungay, 22, of Southampton, who smashed four . goals. Shaun Cole, who organised the charity game and is on non-league Bungay FC's committee, said: 'It was an amazing game. 'It had everything. 'It could not have gone any better.'

Norwegian gunman Anders Behring Breivik cried out in joy as he carried out his massacre on Utoya last year, his trial heard today. Witness Tonje Brenna claims Breivik shouted 'woo-hoo' as he shot dead 69 people on the island. Her account was the first of several from survivors of the youth camp shootings today which detailed their panicked attempts to hide during the rampage. 'Elated': Anders Behring Breivik (left) confers with his defense lawyer Vibeke Hein Baera during his trial last Friday. The court heard today how he produced 'cries of joy' as he carried out his massacre on Utoya . Multiple targets: Breivik looks across the courtroom during his trial last Friday at a life-size dummy used to illustrate how and where his victims were shot on the island . Earlier, the court turned down Breivik's request to question them on the stand. Ms Brenna, a leading member of the Labor Party's youth wing, described how she sought shelter behind rocks on the shore of Utoya island on July 22 as her colleagues were shot around her. She came across a girl who was bleeding heavily. 'I tried to stop the haemorrhaging and keep her awake,' she was reported as saying on the BBC website. 'Then a person lands by my feet, head first and bleeding profusely from the head. I believed that person was dead. There was a feeling of being completely abandoned and of hopelessness - nobody could do anything.' Stealth tactics: Earlier in the trial, witnesses described in chilling detail how Breivik duped them into believing he was a policeman by wearing this fake police identity tag and outfit . Lethal weapon: The court was previously shown this picture of the Glock pistol used by Breivik during the rampage . She added: 'I'm sure I heard cries of joy. If I had to spell it out, it would be woo-hoo.' The 24-year-old told the Oslo court she 'smelled gunpowder' from her hiding place and that 'it stung in my eyes'. Another witness, a local resident, described going out in his boat expecting to be shot as he plucked terrified youths from the water as they tried to swim away from the island. Breivik has admitted killing 69 people on the island, and another eight in a car bomb attack a few hours earlier in Oslo. Breivik has said he considered the Utoya camp a legitimate target because he claims the Labor Party betrayed Norway by supporting multiculturalism. He claims he is an anti-Muslim resistance fighter on a campaign to protect Norway's cultural identity. Since he has admitted his actions, Breivik's mental state is the key issue for the trial to resolve. If found guilty and sane, Breivik would face 21 years in prison, although he can be held longer if deemed a danger to society. If declared insane, he would be committed to compulsory psychiatric care. The trial is expected to last up to the end of June.","Witness said Breivik produced 'cries of joy' as he shot 69 people, trial hears .

Rush Limbaugh’s parent company lost millions of dollars in revenue after the controversy following the right wing radio host’s referral to a college student as a ‘slut,’ Cumulus Media CEO Lew Dickey said. Mr Dickey noted in a quarterly call with financial advisers that the snafu ‘hit us pretty hard.

Cumulus Media CEO Lew Dickey, left, said the company lost 'a couple of million bucks' in revenue after Rush Limbaugh, right, called a college student a 'slut' Spoof: Saturday Night Live poked fun at advertiser's scrambling to pull out, and their 'replacement' with not-so-desirable sponsors . Limbaugh brought about a storm of backlash after he referred to Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke as a ‘slut’ and a ‘prostitute’ after she testified in Washington that birth control should be covered by health insurance companies. Following the incident, dozens of advertisers pulled their content. In the end, nearly 100 sponsors withdrew their support, according to liberal watchdog group Media Matters. Limbaugh insisted during the controversy that more advertisers were filling the gaps, the New York Daily News reported. The incident was famously lampooned by Saturday Night Live’s Taran Killam, who played Limbaugh as he announced some of his new advertisers, including the Syria Tourism Board and Sherman’s Imitation Mayonnaise.’ Beginning: The drama began when Limbaugh called Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke a 'slut' Only 38 stations that air Limbaugh’s program are owned by Cumulus – the rest of the more than 600 stations are owned by Clear Channel Media. According to Media Matters, the latter media group saw their first quarter revenues increase by six per cent to $571.5million. Conservative website The Right Sphere waved off possible implications of Mr Dickey’s announcement, calling the loss in revenue the equivalence of a ‘rounding error.’ Limbaugh was also in the news today for launching a site in rebuttal to the progressive women’s group, the National Organisation for Women. Bodacious: Limbaugh announced Tuesday the launch of 'Rush Babes for America' The new association, dubbed the National Organisation for Rush Babes, is ‘dedicated to the millions of conservative women who know what they believe in: family, American Values, and not being told by Faux Feminist Groups how to think.’ Limbaugh said on his program Tuesday that NOW has one main problem: ‘The flaw…is thinking that they speak for women. 'If there was ever a group that speaks for an almost infinitesimal minority of women, it’s them,' he said, according to Politico. Media Matters’ creator Angelo Carusone fired back, saying that it’s a ‘telling coincidence that Limbaugh launched “Rush Babes for America” on the same day that one of his affiliate providers reported millions in losses direction attributable to Limbaugh’s show.’","Cumulus Media CEO said company lost 'couple of million bucks' in both first and second quarter .

A young mother went to tragic desperate lengths to rid herself of the frustration of solo child-care, killing first her son, then herself. Kelli Sly, 23, of Indianola, was angry with her ex-husband for failing to show up for visitation, police said, and wanted more help looking after her son, Gavin. She killed the toddler at their First Avenue apartment, before driving her car into a bridge support underneath the Iowa Highway 5 bypass along Iowa Highway 28. Tragedy: Kelli Sly, 23, went to tragic desperate lengths to rid herself of the frustration of solo child-care, killing first her son Gavin, 2, then herself . Friends and family said she was . suffering from depression and often appeared distraught. In the past she had been a . victim of domestic abuse and was being threatened with eviction from her . apartment. But during a police check-up the day before her death she told offers she was not suicidal, just mad at her estranged husband, Tim, who had failed to pick up Gavin for visitation. Officers went to her apartment after Tim contacted them saying he was worried she might hurt herself, having made previous attempts to do so. They left after Sly told them she was fine, but by 8.30 the next morning both Sly and Gavin were dead in what police believe was a tragic murder-suicide. Her car was found with an empty child seat in it so officers went to her apartment, concerned for the child's welfare. There they found Gavin’s slaughtered body. Estranged: Gavin's father, Tim Sly, was separated from Kelli but was still supposed to help with child-care. It was he who rang police to alert officers to his ex-wife's fragile state of mind . Sgt. Brian Sher said evidence at the apartment, which was ‘very neat and organized,’ led police to believe that she had killed her son. Distraught: Sly's mother, Sherri Sinclair, said her daughter was suffering from depression . ‘There was an envelope left and it had several items in it,’ he said. ‘There was no suicide letter.’ Sly’s mother, Sherri Sinclair of Waukee, told KCCI-TV Sunday that her daughter had been struggling with depression, but that she never thought it would end up this way. She added: 'It's still a shock, it's hard to understand what went wrong. 'She told me she was tired of feeling this way and she just didn't think things were going to get better. She told me she felt like killing herself. 'I think she felt like things were never going to get better. She was a very angry and depressed, but also a very loving mother. I know she loved me too, but it was just hard for her to cope.' In August 2011 Sly had sought a protective order for relief from domestic abuse, according to court records. After a month she requested to have the order lifted but changed her mind five days later. On Friday she made a second request. Sly and her husband were allowed to be in electronic contact to discuss Gavin and had not filed for divorce. The 23-year-old Waukee High School graduate worked at Casey’s convenience store before her death. A . colleague, 18-year-old Melinda Talbott said she had spoken with Sly a . couple of days ago and said she seemed distraught, but added that was not . unusual. Scene: Officer's were called to reports of a blazing car. They found Kelli Sly, 23, dead inside . Desperate: Kelli Sly killed her son before taking her own life in a tragic murder-suicide . The young mom had found out Friday that she was being evicted from her Warren County Community Housing Agency apartment in a week, Talbott said. Neighbour Dianna Nardini said she saw Sly, her husband and Gavin on Saturday and that Sly had appeared distant and preoccupied. ‘I’m shocked, I really am, because she was a really, really good mother,’ she added. It is not yet known exactly how baby Gavin died. Police are awaiting the results of an autopsy.","Kelli Sly was being threatened with eviction from her apartment .

A massive wind farm that will become the third biggest in Scotland was yesterday given the go-ahead by the Scottish Government. The Viking project on the Shetland Islands will have 103 giant turbines that could provide electricity for 175,000 homes – despite Shetland only having a population of 22,000. The approval could also see the construction of a £500million cable to plug the islands into the National Grid for the first time. An artist's impression of the wind farm proposal and what the Viking Project will look like from the sky . A map of the proposed site layout across the Shetland Islands . However, opponents warned of an 'unimaginable' impact on world-renowned landscape, with the £566million development set to dominate the moors and hills. The turbines will be up to 475ft tall – more than twice the height of the Wallace Monument. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) said rare species such as whimbrels and red throated divers could be at risk. In February, more than 300 people marched through Lerwick to protest at the plans, while 2,500 residents signed a petition opposing the project. But ministers gave the go-ahead, with the wind farm crucial to their election promise to generate 100 per cent of Scotland’s electricity needs through renewables by 2020. The wind farm is the 50th renewable energy project approved by ministers since May 2007. Energy Minister Fergus Ewing claimed the construction work would create 140 jobs. A towering presence: The Viking Project in the Shetland Islands will boast 103 giant wind turbines like these on Whitelee wind farm near Glasgow . He added: 'The development makes the case for an interconnector to connect Shetland to the National Grid, paving the way for more exports and renewable energy opportunities, including marine energy developments. 'The development includes an extensive habitat management plan which will restore peatland and offer benefits to a whole range of species and habitats.' Viking Energy is an partnership between a company set up to represent the interests of the Shetland community and power giant Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE). The publicly-owned charitable trust estimates the farm will provide an annual income of £20million to support community projects, and 34 permanent jobs. But conservation charity The John Muir Trust chief executive Stuart Brooks said: 'The scale of impact on the world renowned  natural landscape of these islands is unimaginable. 'Our objection included major concerns over the impacts on peatland and wildlife and there is little indication that these have been adequately addressed. Restoration of peatlands is a cost-effective means of mitigating global warming – it makes little sense to be digging them up to build wind farms.' Aedán Smith, head of planning and development at RSPB Scotland, said: 'The developers and ministers should have gone much further to ensure any negative consequences would be minimised.' Billy Fox, chairman of Sustainable Shetland, an organisation set up in protest against the wind farm proposal, told The Shetland News: 'There's nothing ever been built to this scale, to this proximity in such a small landscape. You will never be able to escape this wind farm, there's nowhere in Shetland you will be able to go and not see it, unless you look out to sea and that will definitely affect tourism.'It will have a huge psychological effect on local folk, and people are bitter that the promised health impact assessment never materialised.'","Wind farm will boast 103 giant turbines that could provide electricity for 175,000 homes .

Syria has been ordered to announce an immediate ceasefire as fears mount that it will not honour an earlier promise to do so. President Bashar al-Assad agreed to a six-point peace plan laid out by Kofi Annan this week - but as fighting rages on, hopes of peace are fading. A spokesman for the UN-Arab League envoy today told the Assad regime: 'The deadline is now.' His demands came as opposition activists reported yet more violence had erupted between soldiers and rebel forces in the country's northern Idlib province today. For many the talk of a ceasefire has come too late, with fresh pictures showing the flashpoint city of Homs in ruins. More than 9,000 people have been killed in Syria's violence since last March, according to UN estimates. Ghost town: Bombed-out buildings and the wreckage of a car in the old city of Homs today. As talk of ceasefire drags on, the UN estimates the conflict has already claimed more than 9,000 lives . Chaos: Cables trail overhead after the poles supporting them were knocked down in fierce fighting between rebel troops and government forces . Ravaged: Chunks of rubble hang precariously from the rooftops of Homs, which has stood in a state of desolation since residents endured a ruthless campaign of shelling . Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sought to work out a unified strategy on the crisis in talks with Saudi officials today. Mrs Clinton's talks with Saudi King Abdullah and other officials come ahead of a 60-nation gathering of the Friends of the Syrian People in Istanbul over the weekend, aimed at finding ways to aid Syria's opposition. The U.S. is hoping to help unify the splintered opposition's ranks while pushing for humanitarian aid and further isolation of Mr Assad's regime. Saudi Arabia, along with fellow Gulf nation Qatar, has called for a more aggressive approach, including arming the rebels and carving out a safe haven inside Syria from which the opposition can operate. Syria has accepted Mr Annan's . six-point plan, which includes a call for a ceasefire, but the . opposition suspects Mr Assad has no intention of stopping his crackdown . and is only playing for time. The . president said yesterday that he wants the plan to succeed, but . insisted that the opposition must first commit to a ceasefire as well. Annan urged the Syrian government to halt its troops first. Too late? Bullet-riddled shells of buildings are all that remains in parts of Homs, where the worst of the Assad regime's crackdown has taken its toll . Scorched: An ornate gateway in Homs bears the scars of a bloody battle while the building next door is badly burned, its shutters buckled . Ruined: A broken pipe spews water into an empty street in Homs as a damaged vehicle lies in pieces . Destroyed: New pictures from the war-torn city of Homs show how buildings have been blown apart, left, while a car lies upturned and abandoned, right, in what was said to have been a hotspot for anti-Assad sentiment . Alliance: King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, right, meets with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Riyadh as the the two countries seek a strategy to stop the bloodshed in Syria . 'The government must stop first and . then discuss a cessation of hostilities with the other side,' Annan . spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said today. 'We are appealing to the stronger party to make a gesture of good faith. ... The deadline is now.' 'Clearly, we have not seen a cessation of hostilities and this is of great concern,' he said. Mrs Clinton arrived in Riyadh and began talks with Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said. The Saudi official news agency said she then met with King Abdullah in his palace in Riyadh, along with top Saudi intelligence and security officials. 'Clinton will hold extensive talks . with Saudi counterparts on the situation in Syria and on American . efforts to stop bloodbath in Syria,' a Saudi Foreign Ministry official . in Riyadh said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not . authorised to discuss the talks. The . talks came a day after an Arab League summit in Baghdad, where . divisions among Arab nations over Syria were clear. In a sign that they . see little hope in the League's diplomatic efforts, Saudi Arabia, Qatar . and other Gulf countries sent only low-level officials to the summit. In the end, the summit issued a joint resolution that held little new beyond expressing support for Mr Annan's efforts. President . Barack Obama has publicly challenged Mr Assad to leave power, but has . refused to entertain U.S. military options to achieve that end. Washington has said it opposes military intervention in Syria, fearing . that it would fuel an outright civil war that could break along . dangerous sectarian lines. The opposition is born mainly from . Syria's Sunni Muslim majority, while Mr Assad's regime is backed by his . own minority Alawite community, a Shiite offshoot sect. For . the U.S. and its allies, Syria is proving an especially murky conflict . and one with no easy solutions. Mr Assad's regime is of Washington's . clearest foes, a government that has long been closely allied with Iran . and anti-Israel groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Fighting rages on: A frame from a video uploaded to YouTube this week shows smoke billowing from reported shelling by Syrian government forces on a residential area in Homs . Saudi Arabia and other Sunni-led Gulf countries are eager to see Mr Assad's fall in hopes of breaking Syria out of its alliance with their regional rival, Shiite-majority Iran. But the Syrian opposition is chronically fragmented. The Syrian National Council, a nominal opposition umbrella group based abroad, has limited authority on the ground. Syrian army defectors have set up a military leadership based in neighbouring Turkey, but they too have only nominal command over the multiple armed rebel groups inside Syria. The U.S. has warned that al-Qaida and other Islamic militants are also taking advantage of the turmoil, attacking Mr Assad's regime and trying to gain a foothold inside Syria. Aftermath: Mr Assad is shown touring the former rebel stronghold of Baba Amr this week, assuring residents that the neighbourhood would be rebuilt . And unlike Libya, whose leader Muammar Gaddafi inspired worldwide revulsion, Syria still has allies in Russia and Iran and a formidable army of its own. On Thursday, Iran's supreme leader, . Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed to support Mr Assad during talks with the . prime minister of Turkey, a country which was once close to Damascus but . now backs the opposition. 'Iran . will defend Syria because of [its] support of the resistance front . against the Zionist regime and is strongly opposed to any interference . by foreign forces in Syria's internal affairs,' Mr Khamenei said. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran is categorically opposed to any plan initiated by the U.S. regarding Syria.' Asked what might constitute success . for Sunday's Friends of the Syrian People meeting in Istanbul, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said, 'We want to see as . much unity as possible among those members of the opposition.' She said conversations also would focus on humanitarian aid and further isolating Assad's government. That . is the same agenda as the first gathering of the Friends of the Syrian . People, in February in Tunisia. There, the nations issued an ultimatum . to Assad to end the hostilities, but it was roundly ignored. Speaking . on Tuesday, Mrs Clinton cautiously welcomed the Syrian government's . endorsement of Mr Annan's plan. But Mr Assad now has to make good on the . deal, she said, citing the Syrian leader's 'history of overpromising . and under-delivering' when it comes to pledges of peace and reform. Mrs . Clinton said the U.S. and its allies would spend the next few days . helping Syria's primarily Sunni opposition refine its vision of an . inclusive democracy, to assure minorities still supportive of the . government that they'd have a place in a post-Assad future. She said . Washington hoped for progress on that front this weekend.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:58 EST, 1 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:41 EST, 15 May 2012 . A study has found that the use of Tasers, once known as 'non-lethal' devices can cause cardiac arrest and death. The study, conducted by Dr Douglas Zipes, and appearing in American Heart Association's medical journal, analysed information such as autopsy reports, medical records and police data in cases where people had lost consciousness after being shocked by the Taser X26 model. About 334 Taser-related deaths have been reported between 2001 and 2008, according to Amnesty International. The study by Dr Douglas Zipes examined the effects of the X26 Taser model on people . Dr Zipes also notes that unlike guns, Tasers are not subject to regulation by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms because they don’t involve the use of gun powder. Circulation, the AHA's own medical journal, published the findings in what is believed to be the first peer-reviewed study linking the devices to heart trauma and death. An evaluation of the X26 in pigs, sheep and people established that shocks to the chest caused cardiac electrical capture. Ex-Marine Kenneth Chamberlain died last year after he was shot by stun guns in New York . Dr Zipes conducted the study to raise awareness about the fact that Tasers can be dangerous. He told the Cincinnati Enquirer: 'The only way I felt anyone would pay attention would be an article in a respected journal by a respected cardiologist.' The doctor added:  'In no way am I condemning Taser. That decision must be done by law enforcement experts, not a physician. What I want people to be aware of is that there is the potential for death.' In 2009, Taser first implied that its products may be linked to cardiac arrest when the company asked officers to refrain from aiming the weapon at a suspect’s chest. But Taser officials contended that the advisory only meant that law-enforcement agencies could avoid controversy if officers aimed at areas other than the chest. Critics called it a stunning reversal for the company. Last month, gay porn star Marland . Anderson, who is known as Sledge Hammer, died five days after a violent . altercation with police which resulted in him being shot with a Taser. Sad: The 39-year-old had allegedly been dealing with depression, which was exacerbated by his marijuana use . Last year, Former Marine Kenneth Chamberlain Sr was allegedly shot by a Taser at his White Plains, New York, apartment after he had accidentally triggered his LifeAid pendant. Chamberlain, who had also worked as a correction officer, died in a nearby hospital on November 19. Hundreds of Taser-related deaths have been reported in recent years, and have risen due to increased use by cops and security officials.

Without a trace: Gavin Smith, 57, a top 20th Century Fox executive was last seen last Tuesday driving away from a friend's house in LA . The Los Angeles sheriff's department has changed the status of the case of the missing 57-year-old father and film executive to a criminal homicide investigation. Gavin Smith has been missing for one week and in spite of the shift in classification, there have been no clues released to the public to explain the change. Smith, a married father of three, was reported missing on May 1 when he failed to show up for his job at Twentieth Century Fox. Deadline reports that the search has intensified in recent days, but the spokesman for the sheriff's office said Tuesday that there has been no evidence found suggesting foul play. Mr Smith's family says that, after returning to Los Angeles after a business trip, he had planned to spend the night at a friend's house. 'He was still watching TV downstairs when our friend went to bed, and he was going to be going up to bed shortly,' his wife Lisa told ABC News. He was last seen driving away from the friend's home in Oak Park, north of Los Angeles at around 10pm last Tuesday evening in his black Mercedes sedan. The first alarm bells went off when he failed to pick up his youngest son to drive him to school on Wednesday morning, and then never went to work or call the office that same day- two things that his wife said had never happened before in the past 21 years. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Family: Gavin Smith with his wife Lisa who is desperately searching for him since his disappearance a week ago . At the time, Mrs Smith was taking care of her mother who has cancer. In an interview with ABC, Mrs Smith made an impassioned plea, hoping that he may be watching. 'We want you to come home, baby, we love you! Our world is not right without you! Be safe,' she said, fighting back tears. In spite of the calls for tips from the public, there have been no significant finds. Family members have since been unable to 'ping' the missing man's cellphone, which appears to be off and that his credit cards have not been used since Tuesday night. 'We're just doing our best to get as many people looking as possible,' his son Evan Smith, a forward for the University of Southern California basketball team, said in an interview. Family man: Gavin Smith (second left) with his wife Lisa and three sons. He has been missing in LA since last Tuesday . 'We're trying to find my dad. We need our father.' Athleticism runs in the family, as Mr Smith gained notoriety in Los Angeles for being a part of UCLA's 1975 national championship basketball team under legendary coach John Wooden. Evan said that friends first became concerned when his father failed to turn up at the film studio, a job he loves. 'My dad's a good guy, a very responsible man, and it all really took hold for us when he didn't show up for work,' he said. Earlier glories: In his youth, Mr Smith dabbled in acting (left) and was a member of the UCLA national championship basketball team (right) Mr Smith has worked as a film distribution executive at the Calabasas-based company for nearly 18 years.

Dire warning: Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet, warned that patients will die because of healthcare reforms . Britain's health services will be thrown into 'chaos' by the Government's reforms and patients will die as a result, the editor of a prestigious medical journal warned today. The editor of the Lancet, Richard Horton, called for a concerted campaign to overturn the Health and Social Care Bill, which finally completed its parliamentary passage this week. The Government's 'reckless' move to introduce competition into the NHS will lead to a 'fragmentation and disintegration of services' that will hurt those in need, he said. 'We are about to see a phase of unprecedented chaos in our health services,' he told the left-leaning Red Pepper website. 'Those of us who opposed the Bill should not gloat as this confusion takes hold. 'People will die thanks to the Government's decision to focus on competition rather than quality in healthcare. 'The coming disaster puts even greater responsibility on us to overturn this destructive legislation and remove this undemocratic government.' The bitter 14-month parliamentary battle over the coalition's NHS reforms finally came to an end this week after the Government comfortably fended off a desperate 11th hour attempt by Labour to delay the legislation. MPs then approved the last amendments - leaving the way clear for Royal Assent to be granted before Parliament starts its Easter recess next week. The NHS shake-up has threatened to drive a wedge between the coalition partners ever since it was announced by Tory Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. It is intended to give GPs greater control over NHS budgets, reduce bureaucracy, and increase patient choice. But furious opposition from professional bodies and Lib Dem activists led Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to take the highly unusual step of 'pausing' the legislation last year. Despite accepting more than a thousand amendments - including limits on competition and private sector involvement - the Government has failed to win over many health workers. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley arrives to a Cabinet meeting in Downing Street on Wednesday: His reforms finally passed through Parliament this week . In the same piece on the Red Pepper site, Dr Jacky Davis, a consultant radiologist and BMA member, complained about a 'failure' of leadership by professional medical bodies who did not prevent the coalition proceeding with its shake-up. 'Early and united opposition would have seen off the Bill long ago,' she said. 'Instead our leaders, in trade unions and professional bodies, saw 'opportunities' and decided they could work with it on our behalf. 'When they were finally persuaded to see the dangers, their policy changed to seeking ""significant amendments"", despite the fact that the Government showed no sign of conceding any.'","Richard Horton calls for concerted effort to overturn the provisions of the Health and Social Care Bill .

A New York girl kidnapped four years ago by her father has been found living in Thailand by FBI agents. Deonna Shipman, who is now eight, was allegedly snatched in July 2007 by  Jeffery Shipman, 51, after he was denied custody. She was tracked down to Bangkok two weeks ago after a long-running operation by the FBI and is said to be in good health. Taken: Police say Jeffery Shipman kidnapped his daughter Deonna after losing a custody battle . Her father, who used to work for the state Department of Transportation, was detained in Thailand on international parental kidnapping charges and then transported to Los Angeles, where he was arraigned. Deonna has been returned to her Syracuse-area home, according to Onondaga County Sheriff Kevin Walsh. Shipman, U.S. Marshals say, will eventually be returned to Onandoga County for further court appearances. When her daughter was abducted, mother Lioubov Shipman became what experts call 'the left-behind parent'. She will soon return to the Syracuse area from Russia - the native country where she has been studying nursing - to be reunited with her daughter. Ms Shipman and her ex-husband, Jeffrey, shared joint custody of the little girl since their divorce three years ago. Deonna Shipman, now 8, was found two weeks ago in Bangkok, Thailand . While she had physical custody, Shipman was allowed visitation only. Both parents filed petitions seeking to modify the order in June of 2007 in Onondaga County Family Court. At the family’s last court appearance, Shipman told his ex-wife: 'If I can’t have her, no one will.' 'I took it lightly,' she said shortly after her daughter’s disappearance. 'I thought he was just angry.' Authorities believe Shipman abducted Deonna after one of his court-appointed visits after losing the lengthy custody battle with his wife. International agencies included Interpol searched for Deonna, seen here before her disappearance, and finally found her on February 24 . Police . authorities tracked Shipman's car to Monroe County Airport in Rochester . and later determined he had flown to London. At that point, though, . they lost track of him.

A person at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, who has not been identified or charged in a broad U.S. insider-trading probe, was caught on a wiretap leaking secrets about Intel Corp and Apple Inc , a lawyer for former Goldman board member Rajat Gupta said in court on Friday. Lawyer Gary Naftalis, in a heated exchange with U.S. prosecutor Reed Brodsky during a pre-trial hearing, said the Goldman person leaked confidential information about the two companies to Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group hedge fund founder convicted of insider-trading charges last year. Gupta, the best-known corporate executive accused in a sweeping prosecution of insider-trading at hedge funds in recent years, denies criminal charges that he tipped Rajaratnam with Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble Co secrets between 2007 and 2009. Leaked: A person at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, who has not been identified or charged, was caught on a wiretap leaking secrets about Intel Corp and Apple . His trial is scheduled to begin in May. 'In a letter he (Brodsky) said the government had a person who provided confidential information to Raj Rajaratnam about Apple and Intel,' Mr Naftalis said. 'There is also wiretap evidence, substantial evidence of another source at Goldman Sachs.' Mr Naftalis told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff that the defence believed 'there is a much more circumstantial case that person should be sitting in the box rather than us' and 'the wrong man is on trial here.' A theme of Gupta's defence is that the charges brought by U.S. prosecutors last October are circumstantial and that Rajaratnam had a host of sources tipping him with information. A jury convicted Rajaratnam largely on wiretaps, which traditionally have been used in organized crime and narcotics cases, not white-collar investigations. Secrets: The Goldman Sachs worker was thought to be leaking secrets to Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam (pictured) Rajaratnam, once a friend of Gupta's, is serving an 11-year prison sentence. Gupta was onetime global head of McKinsey & Co and sat on the boards of several companies. The judge ended the late afternoon hearing in Manhattan federal court, but Brodsky and Naftalis continued to argue. Brodsky declined to comment. A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Michael DuVally, declined to comment. Goldman has been in the spotlight this week with the public resignation of employee Greg Smith, who said in a New York Times op-ed that Goldman had become 'as toxic and destructive as I have ever seen it' and was a place he no longer wished to work.

A person familiar with the Gupta case said in early March that prosecutors are investigating David Loeb, a managing director of Goldman Sachs. Loeb works with technology hedge-fund employees, including an Asia-based analyst, Henry King, who is also under investigation, according to another source briefed on the case. The sources declined to be identified because the matter is not public. Neither Loeb nor King has been accused of any wrongdoing and neither responded to emails asking for comment. The insider-trading case has drawn in Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who was interviewed under oath on Feb. 24 as a witness, according to court documents. Blankfein testified for the government at Rajaratnam's trial. He is also expected to be called as a witness by the government at Gupta's trial.

Fresh footage emerged today that casts doubt on George Zimmerman's version of events in the shooting of Trayvon Martin. In the video, filmed shortly after the unarmed teen was killed, Zimmerman is seen emerging from a police vehicle with his hands cuffed behind his back as he is frisked and led into questioning by officers. Despite his lawyer’s account that Zimmerman was knocked down and suffered a broken nose in a scuffle with Martin, the video, provided to ABC News, shows no injuries consistent with his description. Scroll down for video . Cuffed: George Zimmerman, in red jacket, is escorted into the Sanford police station following the shooting of Trayvon Martin on February 26 . Footage: In this video provided to ABC News, George Zimmerman is seen being led out of a police car shortly after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin . Evidence: George Zimmerman is seen emerging from a police vehicle with his hands cuffed behind his back as he's frisked and led away by officers . Doubt? Despite his lawyer's account that Zimmerman was knocked down and suffered a broken nose in a scuffle with Martin, the video shows no injuries consistent with his description . Trayvon's parents Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin told CNN’s Piers Morgan that the video proves 'what they have known all along'. Ms Fulton told Morgan: 'We just looked at the video and we were just surprised because according to the police report, he sustained injuries, but when we looked at the video, it was obvious that there were no visible injuries. [there was no] blood on his shirt.' She later added: 'I believe that this video is the icing on the cake'. The family's lawyer, Benjamin Crumb, told Morgan that the footage proves that the Sanford Police Department 'conspired to cover this up'. Zimmerman, who has not spoken publicly since the shooting, told police that he spotted Martin as he was patrolling his neighbourhood and called 911 to report a suspicious person. 'This guy looks like he is up to no good. He is on drugs or something,' Zimmerman told the dispatcher from his sport utility vehicle. He added that the teen had his hand in his waistband and was walking around looking at homes.'These a*******. They always get away,' Zimmerman said on a 911 call. But Trayvon, 17, was not armed. He was returning from a convenience store with an iced tea for himself and a bag of skittles for his little brother. Dispute: A national outcry has many demanding the arrest of George Zimmerman, . right, in the killing of Trayvon . Martin (left) Protests: The killing of Trayvon Martin has sparked numerous demonstrations across the country, like this one in front of the White House . A student newspaper has been slammed for publishing a 'racist' cartoon (below) suggesting Trayvon Martin's death has been hyped up by the media. The University of Texas at Austin 'Daily Texan' publication also sparked outrage by misspelling the gunned down teen's name. In the illustration, a woman wearing glasses sits on a chair called 'The Media' holding a book called 'Treyvon Martin and the case of yellow journalism'. She is seen telling a young boy: 'And then…  the Big Bad White man killed the Handsome, sweet, innocent, colored boy!!' Student Stephanie Eisner, who drew the cartoon, said she wanted to criticise the media's coverage rather than Trayvon. She initially told the publication: 'I feel the news should be unbiased. And in the retelling of this particular event, I felt that that was not the case. She later apologised, saying it was 'in hindsight an ambiguous cartoon related to the Trayvon Martin shooting'. The newspaper's editorial adviser, Doug Warren, admitted the cartoon should have spelled the teen's name correctly and not used the word 'coloured'. But he said the cartoon was not inherently racist. A neighbour said there had been several . break-ins in the community in the past year, including one in which . burglars took a TV and laptops. A dispatcher told Zimmerman to stay in his sport utility vehicle and that an officer would be there momentarily, but Zimmerman - for unknown reasons - got out. Zimmerman told police he lost sight of the teenager and was walking back to his sport utility vehicle when he was suddenly attacked. But Trayvon's girlfriend Deedee, 16, who was on the phone with Trayvon in his last moments alive, emerged Wednesday to add more contradiction to Zimmerman's story. She told ABC News in a brief interview that Trayvon said he saw a strange man following him as he walked back to his father's home. '... and then Trayvon come and said the man was still behind him and I said to him, ""Run!""' the teen said. He and Martin fought, according to witnesses. Zimmerman said Martin punched him in the nose and slammed his head against the ground. Zimmerman’s father Robert Zimmerman echoed those remarks on Wednesday night, telling WOFL-TV his son was being beaten by Trayvon, and the teen threatened him during the scuffle. He told the network: 'Trayvon Martin said something to the effect of ""you're going to die now or you're going to die tonight,"" something to that effect'. He added: ‘[Martin] continued to beat George and at some point, George pulled his pistol and did what he did’. Zimmerman told cops he acted in self-defense, and that he had yelled for help before firing the gun. Police said Zimmerman was bleeding from his nose and the back of his head. But the surveillance video shows no injuries consistent with that type of trauma. Additionally, Richard Kurtz, the funeral director who handled Trayvon's body, told CNN he saw no bruising on the teen's knuckles. 'I didn't see any evdience that he had been fighting anybody,' Kurtz said. In the police video, Zimmerman appears calm as his pockets are checked and he’s led to a questioning room by three officers. In an appearance on MSNBC’s . PoliticsNation on Wednesday night, the mother of a witness in the case . said that she doesn't believe the account of Zimmerman's lawyer. When asked by host Al Sharpton if she believed Zimmerman acted in self-defence, Cheryl Brown answered: 'Not at all'. The . fact that he has not been arrested nor charged in the case has fuelled a . widespread outcry marked by protests, accusations of racism and demands . that Zimmerman be taken in.

"By . Jaya Narain . PUBLISHED: . 17:16 EST, 2 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:47 EST, 3 April 2012 . Three siblings from one of Britain’s oldest families are at war over their mother’s will. The Pennants can trace their ancestry back to the 1400s and the reign of Henry VI. For centuries they would seem to have lived in harmony, prospering through mining interests and vast estates in North Wales. Henblas Hall: The historic grade II-listed property near Tremeirchion, Denbighshire which the Pennant family are in dispute over . But here in the 21st century, matters have turned ugly over the splitting up of the family’s multi-million pound historic home. The Nantlys Estate, built in the 19th century, housed the family in luxury and includes Grade II-listed Henblas Hall, Nant Gwilym farm, two other farmhouses, around 450 acres of land, a 30-acre wood and assorted cottages. Battle lines have been drawn between Lilla Pennant, 61, her sister Banba Dawson, 62 and brother Arnold Pennant, 65. Miss Pennant is unhappy with the way the . properties were split and claims she is being levered out of her . rightful  inheritance. Lilla Pennant: Believes she should have been left more land following the death of her mother Ann . She claims her older brother and sister have been given the  lion’s share of the estate near Tremeirchion, Denbighshire. Now she has taken her fight to the High Court by issuing a writ saying she wants to protect what is rightfully hers. She said: ‘I want to take my share of the estate and live in peace. That is my goal for myself and my two grown-up children.’ Miss Pennant says she is entitled to a fair split under the terms of her mother’s will. Ann Pennant, 88, died in a car crash in 2004. She said: ‘It is clear what the entitlement in the will is. Some people don’t seem to be interested in what is written in it.’ The Pennants can trace their lineage back to the Huguenots – a branch of French protestants who sought sanctuary in England from catholic persecution under the reign of Louis XV in the 16th century. One of the best known members of the Pennant family is the zoologist Thomas Pennant from the 1700s. He also forged a reputation as a travel writer and his ‘Tour in Wales’, illustrated by artist Moses Griffith, popularised North Wales as a holiday destination. He owned land in Tremeirchion and the family made a fortune thanks to the Pennant mine which dug the local hills rich in lead and zinc. Miss Pennant was granted the hall at Nantlys, as well as some of the land but believes she is entitled to further assets. This includes a claim for half the . contents of a safety deposit box which contains letters by 18th century . writer Hester Piozzi, worth £1,000 each, and a self-portrait by Moses . Griffith, worth around £4,000. The . siblings have been arguing for years over the inheritance and now Miss . Pennant has been forced to communicate with her brother through a third . party even though the pair live almost next door. Nant Gwilym farm: Home of brother Arnold Pennant who along with sister Banba Dawson, has, according to Ms Pennant, received the lion's share of the estate . According to the writ she believes he has kept back more than £200,000 for himself from another farm which was sold in 2006 for £1.6million. The court papers state that her sister, Mrs Dawson, who lives in Henley-on-Thames, cancelled a meeting between the siblings in 2008 and has not been involved in the matter since. Miss Pennant, a descendant of the 19th century Lord Chancellor, Lord Eldon, said: ‘I am a single woman being mistreated because I am a single woman.’ She is seeking an order for some co-owned land to be split up and a parcel of one acre to be added to Henblas Hall. She also wants all the money to be shared equally and has requested the contents of the safety deposit box to be divided between herself and her sister. The case is due to come before the High Court at a later date.","Pennant family can trace ancestry back to the 1400s and reign of Henry VI .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:33 EST, 30 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:34 EST, 30 April 2012 . Trouble: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is facing extremely tough times ahead . Spain today officially entered into a double-dip recession - with experts warning that EU-ordered public sector spending cuts will plunge the eurozone's fourth largest economy into further turmoil. Economists also said the cuts, combined with troubles in the banking sector, would delay any return to growth until late this year or beyond after the nation sank into recession for the first quarter. It is the second recession in just over two years and comes as the government tries to convince investors it will not need outside aid to pay its bills like other countries caught up in the debt crisis. The country is now facing intense pressure from its European peers to fix public finances, and growing domestic resistance to austerity measures that have helped push unemployment to more than double the EU average. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's added to the country's problems with a two-notch rating downgrade last week and today chopped the credit score of eleven banks. While the 0.3 per cent contraction from January to March from the previous quarter was slightly better than the forecast drop of 0.4 per cent, it confirmed the economy is in a tough spot. 'The wheels are very clearly coming off the economy,' Jefferies economist David Owen said. 'It wouldn't surprise me to see a very significant decline in GDP both in the second and third quarters this year, and it's still reasonably easy to envisage GDP to be down about 1.5 per cent this year.' Spain was last in recession, defined by two straight quarters of economic contraction, at the end of 2009. On an annual basis, the economy contracted by 0.4 per cent, compared with growth of 0.3 per cent in the previous quarter, today's official data showed. Riots: Spaniards have been taking to the streets to protest against public sector cuts they deem to be unfair and unjustified . The government's latest economic plan, published on Friday before it was sent to the European Commission for approval, forecast a contraction of 1.7 per cent in 2012 turning to 0.2 per cent growth by next year. Spanish bonds showed little reaction to the report but yields have risen to around 6 per cent in recent weeks as investors digest the country's worsening economic news. Yields of around 7 per cent are seen as financially unsustainable and have led to Portugal, Ireland and Greece seeking bailouts from the EU. European markets have remained relatively stable today, despite the news. The FTSE-100 is 0.20 per cent down at 5,737.10; France's CAC 40 is 1.18 per cent down at 3,227.75; and Germany's DAX is 0.28 per cent down at 6,782.20. The S&P downgrades of both the financial institutions and the sovereign put the country's fragile banking system back into the spotlight, while massive unemployment will remain a drag on already tight public accounts. The banks were damaged by the real estate collapse that began in 2008 and now bad loans in other sectors of the economy have risen sharply. Pain in Spain: The nation's banks have virtually no access to the wholesale debt markets and have taken on a large amount of cheap European Central Bank debt . They have virtually no access to the . wholesale debt markets and have taken on a large amount of cheap . European Central Bank debt and have bought domestic debt, helping the . Treasury to fulfil half of its gross issuance already this year. ECB data today showed that Spanish and Italian banks filled their coffers with government bonds last month, confirming that they had helped keep a lid on yields. But non-residents, which before December held an average of around 50 per cent of Spain's debt, held just 37.5 per cent in March, the Treasury said. The country's two largest banks Santander and BBVA have suggested they may not buy any more government debt this year, adding to fears the Treasury may have to pay higher costs to place new debt. Some investors have been betting the ECB will restart its programme of buying bonds of troubled euro zone states to help Spain out but some central bank policymakers are fiercely opposed to the idea. As well as facing pressure from Europe to cut its deficit, there is resistance in Spain for the austerity measures needed to achieve this. Thousands of Spaniards took part in protests yesterday after data showed unemployment at nearly 25 per cent in the first quarter. This tallies with a wave of revolt around Europe to the austerity measures that have been prescribed by policymakers from European institutions and from fiscally conservative countries such as Germany. Economists, including some from the International Monetary Fund, have started to question whether it is right to push austerity at the expense of restarting growth. Owen added: 'I assume we get some policy response out of the ECB and Spain is allowed to rein back on its fiscal austerity it is pushing through. 'There's certainly a lot of push back as people question the German-centric view of the world that everyone needs more austerity.' The Spanish government has announced savings of over €40billion this year from both central and regional government budgets, to try and cut the deficit to 5.3 per cent of GDP this year from 8.5 per cent of GDP in 2011. The conservative government, which took power from the Socialists in December, has introduced a labour reform and a banking sector reform which forces the banks to raise over €52billion in capital this year. However, with property prices expected by some to fall another 20-30 per cent, many economists believe increased banking provisions against potential bad real estate loans will not be enough to stabilise the sector. Some economists say the country will eventually need a financial bailout package like Greece and Ireland but the government has repeatedly said it will not seek outside help.","Country sinks into recession for first quarter as economy shrinks by 0.3% .

Mystery: Police are investigating if student Thomas Healy, 19, was hit by a car, fell or jumped to his death . A father has told of his devastation after finding the dead body of his missing son slumped under a motorway bridge. Mystery surrounds the death of University student Thomas Healy, 19, who disappeared during a night out with friends. His family launched a frantic search when he failed to make contact after getting out of a minibus which stopped on the hard shoulder of the M6. Father John, 48, who had been scouring the area with Thomas’ brother Kevin, when he made the horrifying discovery. He said: ‘As we walked I could see a figure in the distance and said, “that’s our Tom”. ‘I just sat with my son, holding him. He was the best son you could have had. ‘I haven’t just lost a son, but my best mate, too.’ The second year of a geography degree at Loughborough University, was found on the stretch of road in Erdington, on Saturday afternoon. Police are treating the death as unexplained and are investigating whether he fell or jumped. The former grammar school pupil had last been seen walking on the hard shoulder on the elevated section of the northbound M6, between junction five and six, just after midnight earlier that day. It is believed he had been travelling in a minibus with friends on his way into Birmingham, but got out after the bus stopped on the hard shoulder for unknown reasons at about 11.45pm. Worried friends later phoned his parents - John and June Healy - to find out if he had got home safely. Mr Healy said he knew something was wrong and so went to look for Thomas. Mr Healy, a London Midland train driver, said: ‘He would usually text to say he was stopping with his mates, but he hadn’t got in touch. Frantic: Thomas Healy's desperate family launched a search for the former grammar school pupil after he failed to get in touch after a night out with friends, but discovered his body underneath this flyover . ‘We panicked because he was a . responsible kid so something wasn’t right.

"By . Alanah Eriksen . UPDATED: . 16:05 EST, 4 November 2011 . Justin Bieber has spoken for the first time about allegations he fathered a fan's four-month-old child. Mariah Yeater, 20, claims in court filings that the star father her son Tristyn during a 30-second sex session in a bathroom backstage after one of his shows. She now wants to force the 17-year-old to take a DNA test and pay up to $260,000 in monthly child support. 'I would just like to say basically that none of those allegations are true,' he told the Today Show. 'I know that I'm going to be a target but I'm never going to be a victim.' Scroll down for video... Not true: Addressing the allegations for the first time, Justin Bieber told the Today Show, he did not sleep with a fan and is not the father of her three-month-old child . He continued: 'I think it's crazy because every night . after the show I'm gone, right from the stage to my car so it's crazy . that some people want to make up such false allegations but to set the . record straight, none of it is true.' When host Matt Lauer asked if he had met Mariah, he said: 'Never met the woman.' It has been claimed that the Yeater told her ex-boyfriend he was the father last year, but he denied he got her pregnant. According to Frances Lippe who told TMZ that Mariah had been dating her grandson John Terranova in Las Vegas toward the end of high school. Making claims: Mariah Yeater, 20, says she and Justin had a seedy liaison backstage at one of his concerts in October . Not shy: Yeater showed off her tattoos in a series of pictures posted on a social networking site . According to the gossip website . Mariah told John that he was the father and the pair got into a fight . after he denied her allegations. Yeater was arrested and charged with battery, according to TMZ because she had hit John in the face. The family have said they haven't heard from Ms Yeater since. Meanwhile despite Yeater's allegations about Bieber, the Today . set was swamped with excited fans, some who had lined up the night . before to get a glimpse of the star. Justin, who is dating popstar Selena Gomez, smiled happily and signed autographs for the crowd. And he was obviously please with how his side of the story came across. Putting on a brave face: The young singer still managed a smile despite his personal life being thrown into turmoil . Telling my side of the story: The 17-year-old still had plenty of fans who came to the set equipped with posters despite the allegations . The . star tweeted soon after his appearance saying: 'Thanks for letting me . set the record straight. what is real are my fans...this album...and . this charity work. see u guys the 23rd.' Still, Yeater now faces a possible . investigation for 'statutory rape' because singer was under age at the . time she claimed they had sex. Yesterday, a Los Angeles police commander said that his department may look into the allegations. The law states any person 'who engages in an act of unlawful sexual . intercourse with a minor who is not more than three years older or three . years younger than the perpetrator, is guilty of a misdemeanor.' At the time of the alleged encounter, Yeater had only just turned 19. Outspoken: Justin tweeted soon after his appearance on the show, obviously glad to get his side of the story across . Inside her world: Pictures of Mariah have emerged showing off her piercings and tattoos . According to Associated Press, Cmdr. Andrew Smith said that no report has yet been taken about the incident, . which allegedly occurred last October at the Staples Centre. But that doesn't mean police won't . take action, given that it's been reported that Yeater is filing a . paternity suit against the young pop star. It has also emerged that she considered giving the boy up for adoption before instead going public with her Bieber bombshell. 'She didn't know if she was going to . keep him,' said Samra Fae Stepper, a relative who looked after Yeater . for several months during her pregnancy. 'We kept asking about the father, but I didn't press it.' Stepper's mother, Frances Wilson, said: 'I did ask her if she was going to keep the baby. She said she didn't know. 'I don't think she knew until almost when the baby was born.' Wilson said Yeater had told her, 'I'm . pretty sure I know who he is,' referring to the father. 'But she said . she wasn't going to tell him.' Before Bieber: Mariah looks sweet and innocent in her school yearbook photo from 2006 . Yeater's stepfather, Anthony . Simeonoff, only found out news of the baby's supposed dad this Thursday . after friends at his local club read the headlines. 'I'm still in shock,' Simeonoff said, . adding that he believes Yeater. 'I love my grandson. If it's real or . not, I love my grandson.' Meanwhile, The New York Post reports that Yeater was arrested in Las Vegas less than two months after getting knocked up. Records state that on December 21, 2010, Yeater committed battery by 'slapping' a man in the face and later pleaded not guilty. On June 16, Yeater's lawyer asked for . a continuance, noting she lived out of state and was 'under doctor's . orders not to travel due to high-risk pregnancy.' Yeater, from California, claimed in . an affidavit that a security guard working for Bieber . approached her and ‘asked if I wanted to meet Justin Bieber’ before . shepherding her backstage. ‘After waiting for a short period of . time with several young women, Justin Bieber appeared and engaged me in . conversation,’ Yeater reportedly said. ‘Immediately, it was obvious that we . were mutually attracted to one another, and we began to kiss. Shortly . thereafter, Justin Bieber suggested that I go with him to a private . place where we could  be alone. ‘I agreed… and on the walk to a private area, he told me he wanted to make love to me and this was going to be his first time. She said he led her to a bathroom where ‘immediately his personality changed drastically’. What does she think? Justin with his popstar and actress girlfriend Selena Gomez at an NHL Ice Hockey game last month . She . allegedly claimed: ‘He began touching me ... at the time I asked him to . put a condom on for protection, but he insisted that he did not want . to.’ Meanwhile, pictures of Mariah have emerged that show off her tattoos, piercings and her willingness to strip off. She is seen showing off her nose and lip piercings in one shot while in another she shows off two star tattoos on her pelvis. She is seen in another shot cupping her breasts showing off her naval piercing and her tattoos below her waistline. In more revealing images she shows . off two bow tattoos on her back, while she is seen in another picture . make a rude gesture into the camera. The . new pictures also show Ms Yeater’s playful side as she poses showing . off the peace sign while her face is wrapped up in cello tape. Bieber's fans who are known as Beliebers . have reacted badly to the news and Yeater has been the subject of death . threats from fans. One fan on Twitter posted: 'I could kill this b****, really she messes with my baby!!! SHE IS SOOO DEAD.' Mariah's grandfather has also spoken out. Eddie Markouse has told The New York Daily News that Mariah is a 'honest, good person'. 'I don't know the whole story. But, from what I understood, she met him at a concert and he sent two security guards down off of the state to bring her backstage to meet him,' Markhouse said. 'She's basically an honest good person. She's got a big heart. She's a good kid and she loves this baby.'

Aung San Suu Kyi today proclaimed a triumph for the Burmese people as her party claimed to have won every single seat it contested in the weekend's historic elections. Miss Suu Kyi, leader of the struggle against military rule in Burma for two decades, was one of 44 candidates her National League for Democracy Party (NLD) said had won seats. Speaking to a crowd of cheering supporters at the NLD's headquarters in Yangon she called on all parties to support reconciliation and said the election marks a 'new era' for the country. Scroll down for video . New era for Burma: Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi talks to supporters at the headquarters of her National League for Democracy party in Yangon today after announcing a sweep in yesterday's by-election . Time for change: Miss Suu Kyi called on all parties to work together for reconciliation in the country, which has been under military rule for decades . 'It is not so much our triumph as a triumph of the people, who have decided that they must be involved in the political process of this country,' she said. 'We hope that this will be the beginning of a new era, when there will be more emphasis on the role of the people in the everyday politics of our country. 'We hope that all other parties that took part in the elections will be in a position to cooperate with us to create a genuinely democratic atmosphere in our nation.' Her supporters burst into cheers and danced in the streets yesterday when the NLD declared that Miss Suu Kyi had pulled off the once-seemingly impossible and won a seat in Burma’s parliament. The 66-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner was lauded by the people after she beat two rival candidates in a by-election in Kawhmu, south-west of the main city, Rangoon. Hope for the future: Miss Suu Kyi receives flowers from supporters as she leaves her party headquarters . Power to the people: She told supporters gathered in Yangon she hoped there would now be more opoprtunities for the people to be involved in the government of Burma . ‘We won! We won!’ cried her supporters . as they danced and waved red party flags and declared that the people’s . victory had taught the old military-backed rulers a lesson. Pro-democracy leader Miss Suu Kyi was . married to the late British academic Dr Michael Aris and once lived in . Oxford, but she has been under house arrest for almost 20 years in . Burma. There was no word from the ruling . Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which was formed by the . military junta before it ceded power a year ago, or the Election . Commission on the outcome of Sunday's ballots. If confirmed, the sweep would mean the . NLD even won four seats in the capital, Naypyitaw, a new city built by . the former junta where most of the residents are government employees . and military personnel, who were expected to back the USDP, the . parliament's dominant party. Next stop, parliament: Miss Suu Kyi waves to supporters as she leaves the NLD offices . Joyous scenes: NLD supporters turned out in force to cheer Miss Suu Kyi's victory - even though the result of the election is yet to be confirmed by Burma's electoral commission . Although her victory had yet to be . officially confirmed by Burma’s election commission, her National League . for Democracy insisted that Miss Suu Kyi had won – and switched on neon victory . signs at the party headquarters in Rangoon. More than 1,000 supporters gathered . outside the building to celebrate, many wearing T-shirts with Miss Suu . Kyi’s picture on the front and the party’s fighting peacock on the back. Yesterday’s by-election was held to fill only 45 seats in Burma’s . 664-seat national Parliament and will not change the balance of power. While civilian, it is still heavily controlled by retired generals. Party officials had earlier projected it would win 40 of the 45 seats at stake. Miss Suu Kyi and other opposition . candidates will have almost no say even if they were to win all the . seats they contested, but she has given hope to Burma’s poverty-stricken . masses who have lived under military rule for 49 years. Champion: Pro-democracy candidate Aung San Suu Kyi smiles outside a school used as a polling station in today's parliamentary by-elections, as she inspects voting in the constituency of Kawmhu, Myanmar . Joy: National League for Democracy (NLD) supporters celebrate outside the party office as they watch unofficial results showing a strong return in Yangon . High hopes: NLD supporters cheer and brandish a portrait of their champion Ms Suu Kyi as unofficial results arrive . Emotional: Supporters of the National League for Democracy celebrate the unofficial results as they gather outside the party headquarters in Yangon . In the past protests against hardship . have been met with ruthless crackdowns by the military. Hundreds, . including monks, have died in clashes with troops in the streets. But . according to her party Miss Suu Kyi’s place in parliament marks the . start of reforms the people had been praying for. Last night NLD officials suggested that she might become president, something that was once seen as impossible. One party official, Myo Win, said: ‘There is more of a possibility of that now. The army has changed and are now more lenient.’ Hopeful: Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi (right) greets supporters as she travels across the Kawhmu constituency this morning.

Suu Kyi might not have much influence in parliament at this stage, one . supporter, Go Khehtay, summed up the hopes of many when he said: ‘One . day, I believe she’ll be able to bring real change.’ Mr Khehtay was speaking in the village . of Wah Thin Kha, in Miss Suu Kyi’s constituency, where earlier she had . been mobbed by supporters when she visited a polling station. The . community of 3,000 farmers is typical of villages in Burma, having no . electricity or running water.

A racquet smashed by tennis star John McEnroe at Wimbledon, in one of his famous anger outbursts, could be worth up to £15,000 for its schoolboy owner. Sam Matthews’ mother Linda was given the broken racquet by McEnroe more than 30 years ago when he rented a flat from her. In 2005, Sam, then aged 10, took it to a children’s version of the BBC’s Antiques Roadshow. Sam Matthews with a smashed-up old tennis racquet of John McEnroe's he hopes could be worth up to £15,000. The player presented it to his mother Linda when he rented a flat from her over 30 years ago . At the time there was no proof the racquet had been owned by McEnroe, who became as famous for his temper as he was for his tennis. When the show returned to film at Wimbledon for an episode shown last night, presenter Fiona Bruce tracked down Sam and showed his racquet to the American player turned pundit. Viewers will see Miss Bruce tell McEnroe: 'I think it has the ring of authenticity, smashed in a moment of anger.'

Sam, now 17, was delighted to learn the racquet is an antique worth a five-figure sum. 'My mum ran a block of flats where McEnroe used to stay,' he said.

A convicted murderer with a 'White Power' tattoo on his forehead has been sentenced to his second life term for killing a fellow inmate to 'avenge' the death of a nine-year-old girl. Frank Souza, 33, who was already set to spend the rest of his life behind bars pleaded guilty to stabbing Edward John Schaefer, 44, in the neck and chest with an improvised knife 10 days after he arrived in San Quentin State Prison in July 2010. The attack was carried out by Souza to avenge Melody Osheroff, who was walking with her father across the road when Schaefer mowed into them on his motorcycle . Unrepentant: Frank Souza was proud that he had killed fellow inmate Edward John Schaefer for his role in the death of a nine year old girl . Schaefer's blood-alcohol level after the May 2009 incident measured 0.16, twice the legal limit in Novato, whic is near to the San Francisco Bay area . 'All I got to say is, 9-year-old girl,' said Souza to prison staff after killing Schaefer. A member of the racist Aryan Brotherhood prison gang, Souza was adamant that his killing of Schaefer was justified. 'The innocence of a child will be defended at all costs,' said Frank Souza. After the verdict was handed down, Souza read aloud from the William Henley poem, 'Invictus', which Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh quoted from before his 2001 execution. 'I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul,' quoted Souza after his his life sentence without parole was announced. Little Melody Osheroff was killed crossing the road with her father when a drunk Edward John Schaefer ran her over with his motorcycle in May of 2009 . Heavily tattooed Souza cut a deal with prosecutors to waive his right to an appeal when he pleaded guilty. In exchange, authorities agreed not to seek the death penalty against Souza. 'He will remain in prison for the rest of his life,' said Chief Deputy District Attorney Barry Borden. Already convicted nine times of driving while intoxicated, Edward John Schaefer not only killed Melody but also caused her father Aaron Osheroff to suffer the loss of his leg. Edward John Schaefer who was convicted of striking and killing 9-year old Meoldy Osheroff with his motorcycle while intoxicated was stabbed to death at San Quentin State Prison by Frank Souza . Before the court's decision, Souza's attorney, M Gerald Schwartzbach told the San Francisco Chronicle that his guilty plea 'did nothing to affect Frank's future.' Souza was already in San Quentin Prison serving a sentence of 60 years to life for stangling and beating to death a John Carl Riggins, 59, in a back alley in San Jose in August 2007. The men were homeless at the time and apparently had become involved in a fracas after Souza stole Riggins' mountain bike according to authorities. No one from Schaefer's family or the Osheroffs attended the hearing.","Heavily tattooed Frank Souza was a member of notorious racist gang the Aryan Brotherhood .

The escalating violence in Syria’s civil war spilled over its borders yesterday into Turkey and Lebanon. Just 24 hours before a UN peace plan was due to come into force, soldiers loyal to president Bashar al-Assad fired into a refugee camp inside Turkey, killing three people. The camp, in the town of Kilis, had been due to be visited by former UN chief Kofi Annan today. Scroll down for video: WARNING - Graphic content .

The attack was the first since Turkey . began allowing 24,000 refugees, including hundreds of army defectors, to . find shelter in the country. Last night a cameraman with Lebanon’s . Al-Jadeed TV station was killed after Syrian troops opened fire on the . car he was travelling in close to the Lebanese-Syrian border. The U.S. said it was ‘outraged’ by the shootings while Turkey and Lebanon also condemned the killings.

April 11: Annan expected in Tehran to discuss Syrian crisis. April 12 - 6 a.m: deadline for total cease-fire under Annan agreement. Kofi Annan has put forward a peace plan to end the fighting and has laid down a deadline for Syria to withdraw troops and heavy weapons from towns tomorrow. However, yesterday Syria demanded written guarantees that insurgents will stop fighting before it pulls back troops. China has acknowledged differences with Turkey over their approach to the continuing violence in Syria ahead of talks with Turkey's leader who is making a rare official visit to Beijing. China has joined Russia in blocking attempts by the U.S. and others at the United Nations to compel President Bashar Assad's regime to end violence against political opponents waging a 13-month uprising. That has drawn accusations that Beijing is providing political cover for Assad, with whom it has long enjoyed friendly relations. Turkey, on the other hand, has been one of Assad's most active critics and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last week that they are considering taking unspecified steps if Assad's forces do not pull out of towns and cities by tomorrow as agreed. Fighting: An armoured vehicle belonging to the Syrian army is seen in the Al Qusoor district of Homs . On the brink: A peace deal is close to collapse as demonstrators protest against President Assad's regime in Kafranbel, near Idlib . Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin . said China wants an immediate end to violence and hopes the . international community will give Annan more time to put a cease-fire . agreement in place. 'We think the final resolution needs all sides to sit down and talk,' he said. The truce plan effectively collapsed on Sunday after Assad's government issued their new last-minute demands. Eyewitnesses said troops have stepped up their attacks ahead of Tuesday's deadline. The . Free Syrian Army does not recognise the regime 'and for that reason we . will not give guarantees,' he said, adding the government should . withdraw its forces to bases and remove checkpoints from streets. Mr . Annan's deal calls for government forces to withdraw from population . centres tomorrow before a full ceasefire by both sides starts at 6am on Thursday. Even before the setback, expectations were low that the Assad regime would honour the agreement. Fighting: A building is damaged in the Al Qusoor district of Homs in this newly-released picture from Friday following reports of a crackdown by Assad forces .

Mourning: Yet more YouTube footage from this week shows Syrians carrying the coffins of people allegedly killed by regime forces in Duma, near the capital Damascus . There were claims that heavy fighting during the past week has led to 1,000 deaths. The UN estimates that 9,000 people have been killed in total during the year-long conflict. Russia, an Assad ally that supports . the cease-fire plan, may now be the only one able to salvage it. The . rest of the international community, unwilling to contemplate military . intervention, has little leverage over Syria. However, in recent days, Syrian . forces have stepped up shelling attacks on restive towns, and activists . say scores of civilians have been killed daily - at least 100 on . Saturday alone.

The woman killed in Sunday’s crash, a 56-year-old from Queen’s Park in North West London, was a passenger in the back of the car. She was pronounced dead at the scene by an air ambulance doctor. Damage: The Honda appears to have careered through a garden fence after smashing into the other car on the A42 in Warnham, West Sussex, on Easter Sunday . Accident investigators are trying to figure out how the two cars collided. The driver of the Golf was taken to hospital for serious chest injuries and the passenger was treated for whiplash . The three toddlers were taken to St George’s Hospital in Tooting, South West London, for treatment, along with the 34-year-old driver and a 26-year-old female passenger. Sergeant Paul Skinner, of Sussex Police, said: ‘This is a desperately tragic incident that has left a toddler fighting for her life. A full investigation is now under way.’ In the earlier tragedy, Derek Sarkar, 46, and his 14-year-old son Ethan were killed in a head-on collision near the village of East Cowick, East Yorkshire. Sheila Stavert-Lee, 70, the driver of the other car, was also killed. Yesterday it emerged that she had been travelling from her home in York to visit her paedophile husband Anthony Barry Lee in Doncaster Prison when the crash happened on Saturday afternoon. Lee was branded a ‘monster’ by police and jailed for seven years after he was convicted in December of sexually abusing two generations of the same family over a period of 21 years.","Six crash victims all in the same Honda Accord were from one family .

The upheaval within billionaire investor George Soros' firm continues as one of his sons is separating some of his personal fortune to manage it himself. Jonathan Soros, who stepped down in September from day-to-day management of Soros Fund Management LLC, plans to hire at least one of his father's key employees, say two people familiar with the situation. The two sources said Soros' son intends to set up his own family office - something the Soros Fund converted to last year - with the help of David Kulsar, currently chief risk officer for the Soros Fund. Changing times: Jonathan Soros, right, is separating some of his fortune away from his billionaire father George Soros's fund company . 'Jonathan wants to manage some of his own money so the (Soros Fund) family office has made that accommodation for him,' said a source familiar with the situation but who was not authorized to discuss the matter. Jonathan Soros, who was a law clerk for a federal judge before joining with his brother Robert in 2002 to oversee the management of Soros Fund, did not return calls or emails seeking comment. He currently is a senior fellow with the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank group in New York. Kulsar, who also did not return a phone call seeking comment, worked in risk management for John Meriweather's JWM Partners before joining the Soros Fund. Meriweather founded Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund whose collapse in 1999 sparked fears of a financial crisis. Soros Fund Management: The moved comes after Jonathan stepped down from day-to-day management last September . There's no indication of a family feud between father and son - Jonathan Soros continues as chairman of his father's foundation. But the move comes after a year of a big changes and significant losses at the $25 billion firm founded by the elder Soros, a wealthy liberal philanthropist who rose to investing fame on his big bet against the British pound. These developments are part of an ongoing series of structural changes as the Soros fund evolves as a family office, one of the sources familiar with the matter said. Family business: Robert Soros, pictured here with his wife Melissa Soros, has also been a top executive at the $25billion firm . Last summer, the Soros Fund announced it was returning some $1 billion to investors and would cease to operate as a hedge fund and would convert to a family office. The switch enabled the Soros Fund to avoid the March 30 deadline for registering as an investment manager with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm now mainly manages money for the elder Soros, family and his foundation. George Soros has five children. The changes continued in September with Scott Bessent, a former Soros disciple, returning to the firm to become chief investment officer and taking over the daily management of the firm from Soros' sons Jonathan and Robert. Behind the scenes, it also was a rough year for the firm's main investment portfolio, the Quantum Fund. The fund declined about 15 percent last year, say two people familiar with the firm's performance who did not want to be identified because they don't speak for the firm. The poor performance came in a year when the average hedge fund declined about 5 percent in 2011. The Quantum Fund also took a big write-down on a $200 million investment it has with Philip Falcone's Harbinger Capital Management hedge fund. Harbinger fell about 47 percent as Falcone's big bet on building a wireless network called LightSquared appears to be faltering. The Soros firm ended a rough year by laying off a handful of analysts and portfolio managers. In December, a Soros spokesman called the layoffs part of the normal course of business at the firm.","Jonathan Soros intends to set up his own family office with chief risk officer for the Soros Fund, David Kulsar .

The carjacker had jumped into the boy's father's car . while he stood just feet away and took off with the vehicle, but the . three-year-old was still inside. Luckily, the thief left the boy at a . home nearby to the 7-Eleven and a woman . opened the door to his cries.

Trapped: Mrs Shah - who has adopted a pseudonym for her own protection - was forced into marriage at just five years old, despite living in an ordinary British town (picture posed by model) A successful businesswoman has told of her agony after being forced into an abusive marriage at the age of five - despite living in Britain. Samina Shah, who is now in her 40s and too frightened to reveal her real name, spoke out after revelations that Britain's Forced Marriage Unit had handled the case of another five-year-old girl last year. Mrs Shah said she believed she was being dressed for her fifth birthday party on the day of the Islamic ceremony which effectively ended her childhood. She told The Sun: 'There was a lot of . activity - a lot of relatives in the house. I was dressed up in an . outfit which my mother-in-law had bought for me. 'My sister told me later that my mother-in-law had said, ""At last, the beautiful girl belongs to me!""' Pondering . why a tiny girl from a large northern town would be forced to undergo . such an ordeal, she said she thought it was to do with maintaining . tradition - and control. Mrs . Shah was born into a close-knit Asian community, and while her family . lived in Britain they remained true to the conventions of remote . Pakistani villages. Aged . just 13, she was removed from school without explanation. Instead of an . education, she was taught that a woman's place was in the home - and . reminded that the greater her sufferings on earth, the more lavish her . reward would be in Paradise. Samina . was still a frightened girl of 14 when she went through the formal . wedding ceremony which marked her transition from her parents' house to . that of her husband. At 6am the day after, she was forced onto a plane . to Pakistan, told only that she would return to Britain with her husband . when she reached 16. Long before that time, the teenager endured the forced consummation of her marriage after suffering an appalling beating. Missing - one childhood: Locked up by her husband, child bride Mrs Shah used to watch other children playing outside and sigh with envy . Mrs Shah returned to the UK three months later, after her Guardians decided she should be kept there under lock and key. She said the feeling of sunlight on her face was one of the things she missed most during her captivity, adding, 'I used to look out at kids playing and feel an overwhelming sense of envy. 'When you are married at the age of five you no longer live like a normal child. I was deprived of my basic human rights.' After giving birth to a daughter at the age of 20, Mrs Shah said she became determined her child would never endure the horrors she herself had lived through. The law covering forced marriage in Britain makes it a civil rather than a criminal matter, and many of the victims are sent abroad. Those at risk can apply for a court order which bars them or the organisers of the marriage from leaving the country. Violating such an order constitutes contempt of court, which carries a prison sentence of up to two years.  While forced marriages are not recognised as legal in the UK, if victims do not return to Britain then the people responsible cannot be prosecuted.The Government is currently considering a change in the law. Ultimately, her daughter was to be her salvation. Though the years of abuse she had suffered took a toll on Mrs Shah, manifesting as crippling obsessive compulsive disorder, she became interested in studying after watching her daughter's progress through school. To her husband's displeasure, she enrolled in college and took GCSEs. Finally, at the age of 37, she found the strength to leave the man who had made her life a misery, even banning her from smiling because he considered it 'the sign of a loose woman'. In strict Muslim communities divorce remains strictly taboo, and those who do separate from their partners risk being ostracised by their friends and families. While Mrs Shah returned to her parents after dissolving her marriage, the arrangement was not a success and she found herself entirely alone in the world. At her lowest ebb, contemplating suicide, she began composing a goodbye text to her beloved daughter - but couldn't bring herself to abandon the best thing in her life, a child who so obviously needed her. Finding herself outside a church, and ready to turn her back on a religion which had brought her nothing but pain and subjugation, Mrs Shah threw herself on the mercy of a priest. Though she said she was keen to become a Christian, the priest said it was not Islam which had failed Samina - it was people. He made contact with a Muslim woman who provided the sobbing mother with solace, and a bed for the night. Mentor: After ending her own forced marriage, Mrs Shah hopes to help girls understand that Islam does not permit the barbaric practice - and that they too can escape it . Mrs Shah said it was not until she stopped seeing herself through other people's eyes that she felt able to move on from her abusive marriage and take control of her own life. Having reinvented herself as a successful entrepreneur, she now gives talks to women's groups and mentors youngsters in her local area. Above all, she wants to emphasise that forced marriage is completely contrary to both the teachings of Islam and the dignity of human beings. She said: 'Islam safeguards women's rights, and I am delighted that I found the Islam that God sent down - not the one that has been hijacked by the jackals who misrepresent its true teachings.'","Victim tells how her childhood was shockingly ended by the ceremony she mistook for a birthday party .

Israel’s president told how his relatives were burned alive by the Nazis as he warned the world to ‘learn lessons from the Holocaust’ and wake up to the threat posed by a nuclear armed Iran 'before it is too late'. Shimon Peres and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu both chose the opening of the annual memorial day for the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust . to call on the international community to prevent the militant regime from acquiring atomic weapons. Mr Peres, 88 - who was born in the Polish town of Vishneva in 1923 and migrated to pre-state Israel before the war erupted - linked the Nazi genocide to Iran's . suspected drive to build nuclear bombs and its leaders' repeated . references to the destruction of the Jewish state. Warning from history: Israel's President Shimon Peres said Iran is a 'threat to world peace' during a speech at the opening ceremony of Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Day at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem . He told hundreds of Holocaust survivors and their . families, Israeli leaders, diplomats and others at Yad Vashem, Israel's official . Holocaust memorial, that he learned later how Nazi troops beat members of his extended family and ordered them to march toward the town's synagogue. He said: ‘Someone yelled “Jews, save . yourselves!” The Germans shot those who tried to escape. The rest . arrived at the synagogue that was made of wood. Its doors were locked. They were all burned alive.’ Threat: Israel is calling on the world not to underestimate the threat posed by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Iran's leadership . ‘That was also the last day of Rabbi . Zvi Meltzer, my grandfather, my mentor. He was burned with a prayer . shawl on his head. That was the last Jewish day in Vishneva. Not a . single living Jew remained.’ Mr Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize . laureate, said humanity ‘must learn the lessons of the Holocaust and . face existential threats before it is too late. ‘Iran is at the centre of this threat. It is the centre of terror. It poses a threat to world peace.’ The Israeli flag flew at half-mast and . a military honour guard stood at one side of the podium as poems and . psalms were read and the Jewish prayer for the dead was recited. Mr Netanyahu also warned: ‘The Iranian regime is acting openly and decisively toward our . destruction, and it is acting feverishly to develop a nuclear weapon to . achieve this goal.’ He added: ‘Those who dismiss the Iranian threat as a whim or an exaggeration haven't learned a thing from the Holocaust. ‘To be deterred from telling the truth . - that today, like then, there are those who want to destroy millions . of Jews - that is disrespectful of the Holocaust. That is an insult to . its victims and that is ignoring its lessons.’ The stated links between the Holocaust . and Iran showed how more than six decades later, the mass murder of . Jews during the Second World War is still a central part of Israel's . psyche. Solemn: Tram passengers in Jerusalem bow their heads as it comes to a stop in Jerusalem when a siren sounds for two minutes silence to mark Holocaust Martyr's and Heroes Remembrance Day . The nation was created just three . years after the end of the war, and hundreds of thousands of dazed . survivors made their way to Israel. Today, fewer than 200,000 elderly survivors remain in the country. The annual memorial day is one of the . most solemn on Israel's calendar. Restaurants, cafes and places of . entertainment are shut down, and radio and TV programming are dedicated . almost exclusively to documentaries about the Holocaust, interviews with . survivors and sombre music. This morning, Israel is scheduled to come to a standstill as sirens wail for two minutes. Pedestrians typically stop in their . tracks, cars and buses halt on streets and roads and drivers and . passengers stand with their heads bowed. Further ceremonies include the public . reading of names of Holocaust victims at sites around the country, . including Israel's parliament. Remember: All of Israel comes to a halt - restaurants and places of entertainment shut down - as people pause during a two-minute siren in memory of victims of the Holocaust in the market in Jerusalem today . Last night's main ceremony at Yad . Vashem included six survivors who lit six symbolic torches to . commemorate the six million dead. A video segment on each one's personal . story was presented. Hours before the opening ceremony, an . annual report by Tel Aviv University on worldwide anti-Semitism said the . number of attacks declined in 2011, but they were generally more . violent than in previous years. Moshe Kantor, president of the . European Jewish Congress, said his organisation expects anti-Semitic . attacks to rise if European economies sink into further crisis, if . Israel attacks Iran or if violence erupts between Israel and the . Palestinians. He cited the deadly attack on a Jewish . school in Toulouse last month in which a rabbi and three children were . shot dead, apparently by an extremist Muslim gunman, as indicative of . his fears.","President Shimon Peres tells how relatives were 'burned alive' by Nazis in Polish town's synagogue .

Mr Cunningham wants to survive as long as he can for his family . A young father suffering from 10 brain tumours is making a last-ditch bid to raise funding for cancer treatment after his local primary care trust refused to pay for a drug that could prolong his life. Glen Cunningham, 29, from South Shields in Tyneside suffers from a rare form of cancer called gliosarcoma, and believes that wonder-drug Avastin could give him precious extra time with his partner Yasmin Malik, 26, and two young children. Mr Cunningham has a seven-year-old daughter, Lauren, and 10-month-old son - also named Glen. Avastin is licensed by the Government and works by stopping tumours from developing new blood vessels. Last . week, South Tyneside Primary Care Trust (PCT) broke the news to Mr . Cunningham that it was not prepared to pay the £33,600 a year it would . cost for him to receive a course of twice-monthly injections. Now he and his family are desperately trying to raise the funding for his treatment themselves. Mr Cunningham, a plasterer, said: 'This is basically my last chance. I need to start taking the injections right away, I have no time to wait. 'But my survival now comes down to a few thousand pounds, that’s it, and I never thought it would come to this. 'The drug is not a cure, but it will hopefully prolong my life. If I could just try it for a few months to show it’s working - then, maybe, I could get the funding I need.' The father of two was diagnosed with cancer in December 2006 after he suffered a seizure. During 2007 he endured chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, and was delighted when he went into remission. Three years later, in September 2010, doctors discovered the tumour had returned and Glen found himself facing further surgery. When the cancer came back yet again at the start of 2011, Mr Cunningham went through gamma knife - a special type of brain radiation treatment. Glen, 29, with his ten-month old son from South Shields. He needs to raise more than £33,000 for a year's drug treatment . Despite his determined battle against the disease, Mr Cunningham now has 10 tumours on his brain - two of which are inoperable. The difficulties surrounding the drug Avastin relate in part to the fact that, while it can be legally prescribed in the UK, it has not been approved for use by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) - which gives advice on which drugs should be made available to the NHS. NICE, which weighs up the relative costs and benefits of drugs, believes Avastin is too expensive based on the benefits it provides. Ms Malik, Mr Cunningham's partner, said of the situation: 'We’re all devastated. I don’t want to have to tell little Glen in a few years time that his dad’s not here to play football with him because someone decided he wasn’t worth a few thousand pounds. 'I want his dad here with him and if Glen can benefit from injections, it could be reality.' A spokesman for NHS South of Tyne and Wear, on behalf of South Tyneside Primary Care Trust, said Mr Cunningham has the right to appeal against the PCT's decision. From 2014, the Department of Health plan to bring in a new system called 'value-based pricing.' Under the plans, groups of GPs will decided whether a drug should be funded or not rather than the medicines watchdog NICE. Ministers hope this will help to make new drugs affordable through direct price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies. NICE will continue to give advice on which drugs are effective.","Course of medication costs £33,600 per year, which South Tyneside Primary Care Trust say is too much ."

'There are still people out there who care enough to come together and give us a wonderful gift,' Ms Johns said. 'It's been a miracle,' added her husband, Mitchell Johns. Their house was built with labour from Mennonite Disaster Services and other groups and with money donated to the Governor's Emergency Relief Fund.

Rescue workers found Mitchell Johns unconscious under the debris with two bones sticking out of his right arm, a pine limb stuck in his left cheek, and a bad puncture wound in his left knee. Amanda Johns was 15 feet from the house, her right foot mangled and a pea-size puncture in her placenta, causing her to leak amniotic fluid. Doctors rushed her into surgery to try to save her baby, but before they began, a test showed the hole had closed. Then she started dilating even though she was only five months pregnant. Doctors put her to bed with her head down and feet in the air. They warned her she was at risk of losing the baby. While in the hospital, Amanda Johns learned that her mother had died. 'It was unbelievable for people to tell me she didn't make it,' she said. 'I felt like she was right there beside me holding my hand with Jesus and God.

He went to live with his mother, and she stayed with her sister. For Mitchell Johns, his biggest worry was not whether his right arm would ever get its strength and movement back or whether painful physical therapy sessions would get him walking again. He worried that he wouldn't be reunited with his wife by the time the baby arrived. Ms Johns heard her . mother say, 'I love you' as the house disintegrated. 'That was my . mother's last three words before she was blown away,' she said. But Kaden Eli Johns arrived on Sept 1, 2011, with dad on hand.

These days, baby toys cover the living room floor, but soon they will be packed up and moved to their new home. Mitchell Johns held a maintenance job and his wife worked in a poultry plant before the tornado hit. Their injuries make it unlikely that either will be able to hold a manual labor job again. Despite that, Mitchell Johns said he was suspicious when he got a phone call inquiring if the couple would like a house. 'At first I thought it was a scam, but then I got to checking into it,' he said. And the Johns said they don't want anyone to feel sorry for them. After all, they have a new house and a healthy baby.

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 08:49 EST, 4 May 2012 . Estate agents are expecting a flood of buyers from the Continent if the euro is left unstable by elections in France and Greece. Experts say the price of property in some of London's most exclusive areas is already being fuelled by an apparent exodus of the rich to the UK. But if the socialist leader Francois Hollande wins the second round of France's presidential election it is claimed that flow could become a flood. London's posh South Kensington has become an enclave for French buyers, estate agents say. Pictured is Lennox Gardens . He has promised a wide-ranging . left-wing programme, including a top tax rate of 75 per cent and the . creation of thousands of new public sector jobs, including 60000 new . teachers. Mr Hollande, who is ahead in the polls, says he 'dislikes the rich' and had already singled out 'the world of finance' as his principal enemy. In Greece public opinion is opposed to further austerity measures in the lead up to Sunday's election and polls suggest a majority government is unlikely. Estate agent Knight Frank told CNN that continuing fears the euro could collapse was contributing to the rise in property values in central London. The brokers said in areas like South Kensington French investors were the second biggest group after British buyers in the first quarter, accounting for 8 per cent of property purchases. So far this year they say enquiries from French clients have soared 19 per cent.

At nearby Douglas & Gordon demand is so buoyant they are setting up a special French-speaking office.

Ed Mead, director of Douglas & Gordon in South Kensington, said: 'The French have always loved this area but we are seeing more and more. The Treasury has drawn up contingency plans to prevent investors shifting huge sums of cash from the Eurozone to Britain . Despite repeated attempts by the 17 eurozone countries to prop up the single currency, many experts believe the euro cannot survive the coming year intact .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:11 EST, 9 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:18 EST, 9 May 2012 . Milly with mother Kaylee: The youngster had 13 operations on her oesophagus to widen it . A three-year-old girl suffers from a rare digestive condition which means she can't gobble down her food - because it could kill her. Milly Williams must carefully chew every mouthful because she is unable to swallow properly and is liable to choke. The condition means it takes her four minutes to eat a single strawberry. Her mother Kaylee, 26, first noticed something was wrong when she was breast feeding Milly and realised her daughter had turned purple and lifeless. Doctors found a small pouch at the top of the youngster’s oesophagus and which meant her baby milk was spilling into her trachea and lungs - causing pneumonia. Then when she started eating solids it was impossible for Milly to have a mouthful without choking. Now, after 13 life-changing operations to disconnect her trachea and oesophagus from each other, Milly is learning how to eat normally for the first time. Medics have warned the youngster she must chew her food at least four times longer than a normal child or she would have to be rushed to hospital to have any blockages surgically removed. The rare condition, a combination of Tracheo-Oesophageal Fistula (TOF) and Oesophageal Atresia (OA), means it takes Milly four minutes to eat just one strawberry. While most youngsters are warned against drinking coke, Milly often relies on the fizzy drink to help her force the food down. She is also encouraged to eat chocolate and soft crisps, like Wotsits and Quavers, because they are less likely to cause choking. Meal times regularly take longer than an hour with Milly taking longer to finish each mouthful than her little brother Olly, one. The condition also means when Milly starts primary school in September she is likely to have no time left during her lunch hour to play outside with pals once she had finished eating. Her family are already trying to arrange an extra dinner lady for the local primary school - just to watch over Milly while she eats. Kaylee held Milly for the first time when she was eight days old . Doctors have already told the family the condition will never disappear, which means - even as an adult - Milly will be forced to take toddler sized bites of her food. Full-time mother Kaylee said: 'Now Milly does enjoy eating, but sometimes it is difficult to keepher going as she has to chew for so long.' Kaylee added: 'When I first fed Milly I was shocked to see her go purple and lifeless. I didn’t know what was wrong with her. Milly cannot eat carrots, mango, melon and rice in case they get stuck . 'We feel that we have come a long way and Milly is stable. We worry less now as she is old enough to tell us if she has got something stuck. 'Chewing for Milly is a matter of life or death. If she gets something stuck she will cough and panic. It is very scary to watch. 'We try to make it fun for Milly - we tell her ‘Chew, chew, chew’ so she remembers. She knows that she was ill as a baby - I think the more she knows the better.' Milly, who lives with her mother Kaylee, father Gareth, 26, a personal trainer and little brother Olly in Wickhambrook, Suffolk, was born by caesarean after a two-day labour. Doctors diagnosed her with TOF and OA when Milly was one day old and aged just two days old she underwent an eight-hour-long operation. Surgeons at Addenbrooke’s Hospital carried out an oesophageal atresia to divide the tracheo-oesophageal fistula and performed a primary anastomosis to join the two ends of the oesophagus. Milly was allowed to go home from hospital 14 days after the operation, but she kept bringing milk up when Kaylee fed her. Still concerned Kaylee took Milly to Addenbrooke’s Hospital where doctors discovered her oesophagus had in fact closed over and they had to gradually widen it over a number of weeks. TOF is a condition where the bottom end of a baby’s oesophagus is joined to its trachea. Without surgical intervention, this causes air to pass from the windpipe to the food-pipe and stomach and can also allow stomach acid to pass into the lungs. Some babies like Milly also have OA a condition where a baby is born with a pouch at the top of its oesophagus which prevents food from reaching the stomach. This pouch can fill up with food and saliva and eventually overflow into the baby’s trachea and enter the lungs and cause choking. Milly also developed pneumonia and other complications and had to be fed by a tube into her stomach for the first year of her life. So far she has had 13 operations on her oesophagus, which is smaller than an average child’s - and will require further surgery throughout her life. Her oesophagus is smaller in diameter where the two parts were surgically joined together so she has to chew her food carefully so it fits through the gap. Milly cannot eat carrots, mango, melon, rice or slippery foods as they are difficult to pull out of her throat if they get stuck. When she was one-year-old Milly would choke more than 12 times every day, but now she had learnt to chew her food for longer and manage her condition. Now on a bad week Milly will choke 20 times, but on a good week she may only choke once. When she chokes her mother Kaylee has to try and pull the food out of her throat. If the mouthful can’t be reached surgeons have warned her airways can only be unblocked by surgery to cut the blockage from her throat. Kaylee said: 'Milly’s favourite food is lasagne. The best crisps for her to eat are Wotsits or Quavers as they melt in her mouth - chocolate is good for that too. 'The other day my mother drank some tea and it went down the wrong way and Milly told her ‘you must chew’ 'Birthday parties are quite scary for us as parents as you never know what is going be in the party bags. 'I am nervous about her going to school and I hope she will be able to eat her lunch.' Milly’s family are raising money for the Sick Children’s Trust Home who run Acorn House at Addenbrooke’s Hospital where they stayed for four months during her treatment .","Milly had 13 operations to disconnect her trachea and oesophagus .

"By . Michael Zennie . UPDATED: . 16:24 EST, 9 January 2012 . The Food and Drug Administration is warning patients about a . potential mix-up between powerful prescription pain drugs and common . over-the-counter medications like Excedrin and Gas-X made at a Novartis . manufacturing plant. The problem is a result of major manufacturing problems at a . Lincoln, Nebraska, facility which was shut down last month because of the issues. The Swiss drug maker . has recalled bottles of Excedrin, Bufferin, Gas-X and NoDoz which may have . included mixed up pills. Now the FDA says some of those over-the-counter pills may . have accidentally been packaged with powerful prescription painkillers made at . the same facility. The opioid drugs are sold by Endo Pharmaceuticals as . Percocet, Endocet, Opana and Zydone. History of complaints: The Novartis plant in Lincoln, Nebraska, has been the target of hundreds of quality control complains in the last two years . FDA officials say they are not recalling the prescription drugs because . they are medically necessary and the likelihood that they contain stray pills . is low. 'The likelihood of finding a wrong tablet in an opiate pain medication dispensed to patients is low and patients should not be unduly alarmed,' FDA's Dr Edward Cox told reporters . Novartis said it has voluntarily suspended operations and shipments from its Lincoln, Nebraska, facility to rectify the problems at the site. The plant has been under fire from inspectors from the Food and Drug Administration for its quality control. An FDA report said the company did not properly address any of the 223 critical complaints it received in 2011. In 2010, the plant did not rectify 165 of the 587 complaints it got, according to the FDA. Additionally, the company failed to investigate 166 reports of pills being packaged in the wrong bottles in 2009. The Journal Star newspaper in Lincoln reported that the FDA blamed the problems on Novartis having too few people at the plant to review complaints. The staffers the company does have are poorly trained, the FDA, added. Recalled: Excedrin is among the over-the-counter drugs that Novartis is pulling from store shelves . The Basel, Switzerland-based company said it is working to upgrade and improve manufacturing and training at the Nebraska plant before restarting production. Company officials have said they don't know exactly how many bottles will be affected by the recall or when the factory will come back online. Spokeswoman Julie Masow said there is no indication prescription pills actually got mixed up with Novaris over-the-counter drugs, but the recalls are a precaution. The company said its Consumer Health unit will take a one-time charge currently estimated at $120 million in the fourth quarter relating to the recalls and improvements at the facility. Novartis said it implemented the recall, which affects U.S. retailers, voluntarily and is working with the Food and Drug Administration during the process. Quality control: Gas-X was another drug that could have broken tablets, mixed pills or mislabeled bottles, Novartis said . It became aware of the potential problem during an internal review that identified broken and chipped pills, and inconsistent bottle packaging that could cause pills to be mixed up. The company said it wanted to make sure that customers didn't take any pills that they might be allergic to or that might become dangerous when mixed with their other medications, though it also said that there have been no such reports from consumers. Novartis said that some of the bottles of headache medicine Excedrin and caffeine caplets NoDoz with expiration dates of Dec. 20, 2014, or earlier will be subject to the recall. Some of the packages of pain medicine Bufferin and stomach medicine Gas-X with expiration dates of Dec. 20, 2013,or earlier will also be affected. The company said it will post more information Monday at www.novartisOTC.com. Customers can also call the company at 1-888-477-2403 Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm EST.","Company's Nebraska plant closed last month as a result of major manufacturing problems .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:19 EST, 28 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:19 EST, 28 March 2012 . A 15-year-old girl who disappeared on her way to school earlier this month is believed to have been abducted, police say. Sierra LaMar was reported missing by her mother on March 16, having never made it to the bus or her Morgan, Hill California high school on that fateful day. After initially allowing for the possibility that Sierra ran away from the home she shared with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, the 40 detectives assigned to the case are saying they now believe it is highly unlikely that she vanished voluntarily. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Sierra Lamar, 15, disappeared on the walk to her school's bus stop last Friday morning in Morgan Hill, California . Their conclusion was based on Sierra not having a history as a runaway or any unusually negative family problems. Interviews with friends and a search of her computer also yielded no information indicating she fled. A day after her disappearance, sheriff's deputies found Sierra's cellphone, an electronic window into her world which now sits in a San Jose crime lab undergoing forensic tests. It was in a field near where she normally caught a school bus in Morgan Hill, a semi-rural community of 40,240 on the fringes of Silicon Valley surrounded by mountains, orchards and reservoirs. For her family and many of the 583 volunteers who turned out to search for her, Sierra's abandoned phone wiped away thoughts that she ran away. 'A teenage girl without her phone? No way,' said Gwen Dorcich, a mother of two teenagers who showed up at a vacant elementary school that was transformed into the search command center to sign up as a volunteer. 'If she was planning to run away, she was going to tell friends that.' So far, however, the investigation has provided more questions than clues. Search: Both the teen's cell phone and laptop are now undergoing forensic studies for any further clues . Clues: Her mother snapped this photo of her the morning she disappeared, appearing playful which followed her parents and friends' perception of nothing out of the ordinary . Santa Clara Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Jose Cardoza told ABC News: 'The first week the focus was on the public’s help for possible . sightings. Now the focus is to call us with people that . are suspicious in the neighborhood. We don’t know where she could be in . the area, but we are thinking that whoever is involved either lives in . Morgan Hills area or has a familiarity with the area.' The day after deputies located her . Samsung Galaxy smartphone, they came across Sierra's handbag a few . blocks away. Several items of her clothing - a San Jose Sharks T-shirt, . pants and undergarments - were folded neatly inside. Tracking dogs lost her scent at the . end of the driveway of her home on a cul-de-sac, leading investigators . to hypothesize she never got much further. 'This seems like a very remote . location, and it seems like anybody who would have been there had to . have a reason to be there,' said Marc Klaas, whose 12-year-old daughter . Polly was kidnapped from her Northern California home in 1993 and . murdered. 'Therefore, my immediate thought was: . Whatever happened to Sierra, assuming she did not run away, happened on . this block,' he said. A missing children's foundation he . founded in his daughter's memory is organizing searches in the city, . about 25 miles south of San Jose. Of the 46 similar searches the . KlaasKids Foundation for Children organized last year, 37 resulted in . either a victim being found alive or their remains located, he said. School: Last week, sheriffs investigators visited Miss Lamar's school of Sobrato High, suspending their ground search for interviews with her classmates and friends . Without a trace: While police dogs lost her scene at her mother's driveway her cell phone was recovered Sunday in a field nearby . Growing concern: Clothes belonging to Sierra Lamar have been found after the teenager went missing 12 days ago from her home in Morgan Hill, California . The law enforcement response has . included searching the homes of neighbors, contacting registered sex . offenders, interviewing friends and relatives, and stopping drivers who . travel the road where Sierra picked up the bus and where her phone and . purse were found to ask if they saw anything unusual. On Tuesday, a sheriff's team boarded a . boat with a cadaver dog to search the shores of Calero Lake, a . reservoir and teen hangout, while volunteers walked the surrounding . brush-covered slopes in a line formation. A weekend search by the sheriff's . department and the FBI covered a 12-square-mile radius from Sierra's . home. It included canyons and hillsides off major highways that could . provide a place to dump something in a hurry, Cardoza said. People have called in tips about seeing a girl matching Sierra's description, he said, but none had panned out. 'We do not know what she was wearing . when she left the house, we don't know when she left the house because . no one saw her do it, and we have not had any new credible leads or tips . or evidence since discovering the bag of clothes,' Cardoza said. 'There . has been... so many unknowns.' Marlene LaMar told investigators she last saw her daughter when she left for work about 6am on March 16. Volunteers: Searchers are briefed by members of the KlaasKids Foundation for Children as they sign up for duty on Tuesday . Hunt continues: A Santa Clara County Sheriff photographs possible evidence that a volunteer searcher under the guidance of the KlaasKids Foundation for Children discovered in the area near Calero Reservoir on Tuesday . Keeping hope alive: Volunteer searcher Rodney Ray under the guidance of the KlaasKids Foundation for Children bags possible evidence in the case . Search and rescue: The Santa Clara County Sheriffs underwater search unit prepares to lower a zodiac into Calero Reservoir to look for clues on Tuesday . Just before 6:30am, when Sierra . ordinarily got ready for school, the teenager tweeted. A friend received . a routine text message from her about 40 minutes later, the time she . usually left home to catch the bus, authorities said. But investigators have not found anything to signal where to look now. The MacBook she got for her birthday . has not provided any hints about where she might be. The night before . she disappeared, she tweeted that she planned to write a school essay . about teen depression and suicide. That same week, she tweeted: . 'suiiiiicide im tooo aliiiiive kill ya sellf.' Sierra and her mother have been living . in Morgan Hill since October. Tonya Miller, a family friend, said . Sierra appeared to have adjusted to the move, briefly joining a private . cheerleading club and befriending the daughter of her mother's . boyfriend. The sheriff's department said neither Marlene LaMar nor her boyfriend is considered a suspect. Authorities also absolved Sierra's . father, Steve LaMar, a registered sex offender convicted in 2009 of one . count of lewd or lascivious conduct with a child under 14. The victim . was not Sierra or her older sister. Police say he is cooperating in the . investigation and is not a suspect. 'I'm not going to hide it. It is very important they interview me, I get cleared and cooperate with everything,' LaMar said. Sex offender: The California sex offender registry entry for Steve Lamar, Sierra's father . The night before Sierra went missing, . she asked her father to make an appointment to get her hair highlighted. He said he texted her the next day to say he had, but never got a . reply. When investigators reported finding . the phone, Steve LaMar said, 'That was pretty disturbing because we know . that she is 15 years old and she loved that phone and was always on it. We would get mad at her for being on it at dinner.' Among the hundreds of volunteers Tuesday were several who endured the same ordeal as Sierra's family. One was retired San Jose Police . Officer Pat Boyd. His 28-year-old daughter, Cristie Wilson, disappeared . from a Sacramento-area casino in 2005. A man who gambled at the casino . that night has been convicted in her murder, but her body never was . found. On Tuesday, Boyd stood in the command . center, explaining to volunteers returning from a fruitless search that . their effort was still valuable not just to investigators trying to . narrow the territory they have to cover but also Sierra's parents, who . have only question marks. 'Do I hope and pray she is just a . misguided teenager and ran away? Yes, that is my number one hope,' he . said. 'Number two is that somebody did abduct her and is keeping her . alive somewhere. And the last is that at least the family gets closure . by finding out who did it and where she is.'

"By . Ian Gallagher and Allan Hall . PUBLISHED: . 18:02 EST, 31 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:02 EST, 31 March 2012 . A former police commander embroiled in an alleged plot to destroy Sky’s biggest rival was once investigated over his links to one of Britain’s most notorious criminals. Ray Adams, who headed a secretive security unit at a company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, faced an inquiry over corruption allegations and his relationship with killer Kenneth Noye. Last week Mr Adams was under fire again after Panorama claimed he used a hacker to undermine the business of ITV-owned ONdigital, an allegation he denies. 'Convict informants': Former police chief Ray Adams, left, had links to notorious criminals including road rage killer Kenneth Noye, right . Is is understood he ran Noye as an informant for many years. Noye was cleared of murdering a police officer in 1985 but was later convicted of the 1996 road-rage killing of Stephen Cameron. He fled the country after stabbing Mr Cameron at a junction of the M25 but was eventually tracked down in Spain  and convicted in 2000. A former Minister has criticised the police’s phone-hacking inquiry after he was contacted about being a potential victim. Lord Hesketh said that he ‘burst out laughing’ when he was rung by an officer about a possible breach of privacy. The peer, 61, said it was ‘remarkable’ that Scotland Yard thought he was a target simply because a News of the World reporter had his phone number  in a diary – as it had been in the  public telephone directory for ‘many years’. He has dismissed the inquiry as ‘a waste of police time’. Hesketh, a junior Minister under Margaret Thatcher and John Major who defected to UKIP last year, was told his name and number were on a list found in a diary belonging to Clive Goodman, former Royal editor of the News of the World, who was jailed in 2007 for intercepting voicemails. He said: ‘It was my old home telephone number and it had been in the local directory for many years, which leads me to believe that Mr Goodman probably only had to call directory enquiries to obtain it. My experience illustrates very well that this inquiry has gone far too far. ‘I don’t have much confidence in where this vastly expensive police operation is going. This is public money. It’s wasting police time,  too, and it is political correctness running riot.’ Mr Adams headed the Met’s criminal intelligence department SO11 before retiring prematurely from Scotland Yard in 1993 with back problems. He later joined NDS, a subsidiary of News Corporation, and was responsible for the security of Murdoch’s pay-TV empire. The Mail on Sunday has learned that while in this role he tried unsuccessfully to recruit brilliant German computer hacker Boris Floricic, 26, who died in mysterious circumstances in 1998. In 1987 the corruption investigation examined claims that Mr Adams and other officers had taken bribes and had improper relations with criminal informants. Three years after the investigation began the Director of Public Prosecutions announced there was no evidence to justify charges against Mr Adams and cleared him of any wrongdoing. However, the link to Noye resurfaced after Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death in 1993 – three years before the road-rage killing. One of Mr Adams’s last acts before leaving the Met was to write to the lawyer acting for Stephen’s parents. The letter formed the basis of two days of hearings in Sir William Macpherson’s public inquiry into the case in 1998. The main allegation against Mr Adams was that he had links with Noye, who in turn had links with Clifford Norris, a criminal whose son David was this year found guilty of Stephen’s murder. It was suggested that he tried to impede the arrest of the suspects. The Macpherson report found no evidence of any dishonesty, collusion or corruption by Mr Adams but noted that there were ‘strange features’ to his evidence. Meanwhile Panorama claimed last week that NDS stole secret codes from ONdigital before passing them to hacker Lee Gibling. His website shared the details, resulting in counterfeit viewing cards that allowed widespread free access. Vital role: Rupert Murdoch put the security of his pay-TV empire in the hands of Mr Adams after the Met chief retired from Scotland Yard . Mr Gibling said he was given the information by Mr Adams, who paid him £60,000 a year. But Mr Adams denied all the claims. Around the same time Mr Adams tried to hire Mr Floricic, who turned him down. Four months later he was found hanged, but his corpse was standing with both feet on the ground. Yesterday an NDS spokeswoman said: ‘NDS uses industry contacts to catch both hackers and pirates. All NDS staff and their contacts operate under a clear code of conduct.’ Mr Adams could not be contacted.","Former police chief was investigated over relationships with criminals .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:08 EST, 3 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:25 EST, 3 April 2012 . Two men who terrorised an old lady have been jailed after police used a 'facial mapping' expert to confirm the identity of one of the suspects who had been captured by CCTV. Barry Hilton, 48, and Thomas Pearson, 42, robbed an 81-year old woman at her home in Manchester, putting a pillow over her face to stifle her screams when she woke to find them in her bedroom at 5am. The pair were caught on CCTV outside their victim's flat at a sheltered housing complex in Fallowfield, Manchester. Pearson's face was partially obscured by his hood but his left cheek was visible. A forensic facial mapping scientist was called in to give a positive identification. Facial mapping: Officers noted the contours of Pearson's left cheek using a still from the CCTV image. They could then search a digital database for the closest match . The pair ransacked the woman's property and stole her handbag, which contained her . £300 pension money. Detective constable Adam Cronshaw explained, 'Officers picked up the pair a couple of days after the robbery as they were acting suspiciously and wearing very similar clothes to the men caught on the CCTV footage. 'Officers had noticed that in the CCTV one of the faces was partially uncovered, so we took photographs of one suspect while he was in custody, from the same angle as the video footage. 'A forensic facial mapping scientist examined both the CCTV stills and the photographs we'd taken and supported the prosecution's case that one of the males in the CCTV was Thomas Pearson.' On the day of the trial Pearson pleaded guilty. Hilton had earlier pleaded guilty as his fingerprints were found in the victim's flat. Both men were career villains with a . string of convictions and the old lady was targeted because Pearson knew . where she lived, as his late father lived in the same complex. The . woman told police: 'I was terrified I would be pulled out of the bed . and kicked which would make me an invalid. I feared I would be raped or . murdered. Identified: Hilton and Pearson thought they had got away with their crime initially, but police closely examined the CCTV footage and used a digital mugshot database to pinpoint the criminals . 'However after they left I was able to deal with the incident in my mind as I’m very religious. I believe the robbery was fate and sent to challenge my faith.' At Manchester Crown Court, Hilton was jailed four years and five months and Pearson was jailed for five years and eight months after both pleaded guilty to robbery. Greater Manchester Police said the aid occurred on August 9 2011 when the pensioner, who lives alone, woke up to find the men in her bedroom searching through her bedside drawer. They demanded money, then covered her face with a pillow to stop her from screaming. The woman’s handbag was later found dumped on a nearby street without the money. Detectives launched inquiries and . managed to trace CCTV footage which showed Hilton and Pearson walking . towards the victim’s flat at 5.09am. At . 7.55am on Sunday 14 August 2011, police officers attended a report of . men behaving suspiciously on bikes in Rusholme and arrested Hilton and . Pearson in relation to other offences. Hilton . was wearing a blue top that was identical to the one being worn by one . of the men on CCTV footage near the victim’s flat. Grainy: The CCTV of the suspects lurking outside the woman's flat was captured on August 10 last year . Hilton’s fingerprints were fast tracked whilst in custody and matched those recovered from the victim’s flat. Pearson, who had knowledge of the flat complex because his father previously lived there, was later recognised in further CCTV footage that was recovered showing him without his his face being concealed. He denied it was him but a facial mapping expert’s analysis report provided vital supporting evidence that it was him. Detective Constable Adam Cronshaw from Greater Manchester Police said: 'This was a terrible crime on a defenceless 81-year-old lady woman who has been sadly affected as a direct result of Hilton and Pearson’s actions. 'To be woken and robbed in the middle of the night, in your own home, must be terrifying for anyone but especially an 81-year-old single woman. 'GMP will always relentlessly pursue anyone who commits this type of crime until they are brought to justice.'","81-year-old pensioner feared she would be raped or murdered .

A jet-setting mother who pocketed more than £100,000 in state handouts by claiming she could barely walk yet still flew around the world was jailed today. Former hairdresser Debra Allan, 49, . ripped off the taxpayer by squandering her welfare cash on holidays to . Dubai, Laos and Thailand. In one year alone, the benefits cheat enjoyed five months in Italy. Allan had claimed her husband Michael . was her sole carer and that it took her 15 minutes to walk 30m - saying . she needed help getting out of bed, to go to the toilet, someone to cook . for her and to help her take medication. She also claimed she needed a mobility scooter, or her husband would 'push her in a wheelchair', he added. But holiday snaps showed Allan using a treadmill in Dubai going on a giant water slide and going down another on a surf board. Inquiries revealed her husband was in fact a construction engineer earning £72,000-a-year in the Far East. DWP . officials also captured Allan as she walked her Westland Highland . terriers near her home at Leasowe on the Wirral and bending down without . difficulty. A total of . £110,693.44 of income support allowance, carer's allowance, employment . support allowance, council tax benefit and disability allowance was . illegally claimed between June 2004 and January 2010. At Liverpool Crown Court mother-of-three Allan was jailed for 18 months after she admitted benefit fraud offences. The court heard Allan who has three children from her first marriage - two sons, aged 27 and 29 and a daughter, 21 - made claims after being diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2003, which resulted in her having to undergo a full hysterectomy that year. Her husband Michael Allan, with whom she has since separated, claimed income support saying that neither he, nor the defendant was working. He had been made redundant earlier that year, so they were entitled to this and the tax benefits they received. Mrs Allan also claimed disability allowance, which was legitimate at first, and her husband received carer's allowance for looking after her. Mr Kevin Slack, prosecuting, said the . fraud began in June 2004 when Mr Allan got a construction job in Italy - . and failed to notify the DWP. A letter was written to the DWP asking for the money to be put into a post office account. Allan then continued her walk completely untroubled in front of the camera. She got an 18 month sentence for committing benefit fraud . While walking her dogs, Allan was shown bending down to pick up a ball on the CCTV footage . 'The nominated account was one in the name of the defendant. Over the next three-and-a-half years more than £50,000 was put into that Post office account. 'She dishonestly retained those monies . that had been improperly paid into this. She failed to notify the DWP . of the change in circumstances.' In . 2005, Mr Allan then went to work on constructing terminal three at . Dubai airport and in early 2007, he was based in Qatar, before moving to . Laos in the far east where he received a monthly salary of around . £6,000. DWP surveillance footage of Debra Allan showed how her claim she could barely walk was a lie . 'He was supporting the defendant, yet she continued to claim income support on the basis that the family had no income', said Mr Slack. He said Allan's diary from 2005 had been seized and it revealed she had spent 156 days in Italy during 2005. The LEA were made aware that her daughter had been placed in alternative care - staying with her grandmother. In April 2007 a carer review form was completed in the name of Michael Allan, but the handwriting suggested it was the defendant who had filled it out. 'She now accepts that was a false claim', he said. Mr Slack said there had been a substantial improvement in Allan's mobility and her need of care by March 2006 - and photographs showing her using a treadmill in Dubai, where she enjoyed several trips, proved this. Debra Allan, pictured arriving at Liverpool Crown Court, tried to hide her face from photographers, but failed in the wind . On her return from visiting Dubai, the claimant filled out a disability review form, stating her husband was her sole carer and that it took her 15 minutes to walk 30 metres. 'She stated she needed someone with her when outdoors, she needed a mobility scooter, or her husband would push her in a wheelchair', he added. The defendant also claimed on the form, received in July 2006, she needed help getting out of bed, to go to the toilet, someone to cook for her and to help her take medication. He said: 'It was a complete fabrication. Her husband was in no position to provide such care because he was working abroad.' Other holiday snaps taken later that year in Dubai, showed the defendant going on a giant water slide and going down another on a surf board. When the DWP grew suspicious in January 2008 and attempted to contact Michael Allan at his home address, Mrs Allan called to say her husband had started to work abroad and did no longer needed the income support benefit. She then got her daughter, who was 17 at the time, to submit a carer's allowance form, even though later that year Allan was able to travel to Laos and Thailand. In February 2009 she claimed for employment and support allowance saying she had separated from her husband and had no idea where he was and she had no income of her own. Her husband was still working in Laos on around £7,000 a month before tax and he was still supporting her. An investigation launched in 2009 by the DWP caught the defendant out walking her dogs, carrying a vacuum, doing her shopping unaided and revealed she was a member at a gym and leisure centre. Mr John O'Leary, defending, said Allan had come from an unhappy and abusive marriage before she met Michael in 1996, who she married in 2000. Her marriage to Michael was not easy because of the strained relationship he had with her two sons. She was subjected to emotional abuse during this time. He said prior to her diagnosis she led an active life, with her own hairdressers and lectured part-time at a college. He said: 'She had hoped of becoming a successful business woman.' But her life dramatically changed after diagnosis, after which she also had to deal with the death of her parents. He said the defendant turned to drink at times of economic difficulty and she became aware of her husband, who now suffers a malignant brain tumour, was having affairs with other women, which encouraged her to visit him. 'She does not in any way wish to portion blame, she accepts the full scale of her offending. She has accepted that what she has done has been fundamentally dishonest. She knows that there are no excuses', he said. The court heard Allan's husband was not before the court because he was suffering from a brain tumour. Judge David Aubrey said: 'These offences are so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence is justified. You were defrauding the department, the tax payer and the public for a considerable duration of time. 'Your dishonesty and the extent of your dishonesty - it was blatant through and through. Your mobility improved considerably. Your mobility was not restricted to a scooter or a wheelchair - your mobility included using a giant water slide and running on a treadmill and considerable activity such as that.' And he said she was travelling to Italy, Dubai, Laos and Thailand during this period - the costs being footed by the tax payer. And the judge did not deem the exotic trips to be taken for the sole purpose of seeing her husband. 'You were travelling to those destinations because you were enjoying the life abroad. You were being dishonest for one purpose and one purpose alone, that was to receive monies that you knew you were not entitled to.'","Debra Allan said she couldn't walk and needed a wheelchair or scooter .

A bereaved father was yesterday convicted of a road rage attack but spared jail after a judge hailed his ‘extraordinary’ role in defusing the summer riots. Tariq Jahan, 46, was praised by both the police and Prime Minister David Cameron over his call for an end to the violence just hours after the murder of his son. The delivery driver faced a maximum sentence of five years in jail after being convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm on factory worker Sajjad Ali. Tariq Jahan (left)  was accused of assaulting Sajjad Ali (right) after they got into an argument outside Mr Ali's workplace in Factory Road, Handsworth, last July. Both are seen outside Birmingham Crown Court . The court heard he had punched Mr Ali . to the ground – breaking his jaw in two places – a month before his . son, Haroon, 21, and brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, . died at the height of the August violence. They were run down by a car . in Winson Green, Birmingham. Judge William Davis QC said: ‘People who break people’s jaws in this kind of mindless violence normally go to prison.’ But he told Jahan: ‘You suffered the . loss of one of your sons, which was desperate in itself. But more . particularly, in the aftermath of this loss you took steps which . probably prevented really serious disorder continuing in Birmingham.’ The judge described Jahan’s actions as ‘a genuine  public service’. Jahan’s 12-month prison sentence was . suspended for two years. He was handed 100 hours  of unpaid work and . told to pay  Mr Ali £1,000 compensation. The court had heard how Tariq Jahan, 46, grabbed 34-year-old Sajjid Ali by the . throat before punching him to the ground after the pair got into an . argument in Handsworth, Birmingham, on July 6 last year. He had accused the factory worker of staring at his wife. The judge said he had sentenced . many people for riot-related crimes since last summer and Jahan was cleared of the more serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Tariq Jahan (at the microphone) addresses community groups from across Birmingham at a peace rally protest in Summerfield Park last August a week after his son was killed . Yesterday, Jahan sobbed and held his head . in his hands as he gave evidence to the jury at Birmingham Crown Court. His 21-year-old son Haroon died as . riots swept across the country last August and Jahan admitted hitting Mr Ali in . the face but told the court he acted in self defence after Mr Ali head-butted him, and denies the charge against him. He said he pulled over and got out of . his car to speak to Mr Ali after the pair got into an argument over . Jahan sounding his car horn at a van blocking his path. Mr Ali had been . standing on the roadside speaking to the driver of the van. Tariq Jahan came into the public eye when Haroon (in photo) was killed while protecting their community from looters . Jahan told the court Mr Ali was mouthing something at him in an 'aggressive manner'. He said he wound down the window on . the passenger side of his white Mitsubishi car and asked Mr Ali about . where he was from and what his religion was in an attempt to relate to . him and find some common ground. He said: 'I asked, ""are you Pakistani, . Iraqi, Sikh, Hindu or Muslim"", just to try to relate to him. He looked . very similar to me and I suspected he was of Asian descent and because . he was a young man and he looked a bit upset I was trying to calm him . down. 'I thought if I could relate to what he was, I could talk to him better. 'He replied, ""F*** off you grey haired old fart, what has it got to do with you?"" 'I parked the vehicle. My wife (in the passenger seat) said to me, ‘what are you doing?', I said, ‘I'm going to talk to him.' 'I normally speak to people who are aggressive.' Jahan said he was 'upset' when the . incident became violent, adding: 'I didn't want confrontation, I just . wanted to try to resolve something that I thought I could resolve. I . wasn't proud of what I had done. I was not happy. 'To see what I had done played on my mind as I drove back home. To me, it was the only means of defending myself. 'I was hoping to calm him down. He was a young man and he seemed to be getting aggressive over a minute issue.' Asked why he did not just drive away, . he said: 'It is not in my nature to drive off. You try to resolve . issues, you don't run away from issues. 'I thought if I talked to him I could . calm him down. I suppose now with hindsight I could have, I should have, . driven off. It probably wouldn't have got to this stage. 'If human beings can relate to one another, they tend to calm down.' Jahan's son Haroon and his friends - . brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31 - were struck by a car in . the early hours of August 10 last year during disorder in the Winson . Green area of Birmingham. They were pronounced dead in hospital and hailed as heroes who died protecting homes and shops from looters. From left, Haroon Jahan and brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, all died after being hit by a car in the early hours of August 10 . Jahan, of Winson Street, Winson Green, . later made a heartfelt plea to crowds of youths gathered outside his . home to end the disorder and 'go home'. His personal call for calm was credited with helping to bring an end to the riots. Asked about his actions in the hours . following his son's death by defence barrister Ali Naseem Bajwa, QC, he . said: 'There is hardly any issue in life that can't be resolved by . talking to someone.' Sobbing, he added: 'I had my own loss . at the time and I felt that it was not necessary for other people to . suffer what I had suffered.' Jahan subsequently received a Pride of . Britain special recognition award for his compassion and dignity in the . aftermath of his son's death. Giving evidence to the court . yesterday, Mr Ali said Jahan drove up to him in his car and said: 'Oi, . why you staring at me?' before getting out of the vehicle and accusing . him of 'staring at my missus'. Mr Ali, 34, alleges he was grabbed by . the throat by the defendant, punched in the face and knocked to the . floor, then kicked or punched while he was on the ground. Mr Ali told the jury of five women and . seven men Jahan's manner was 'really aggressive' when he approached him . and accused him of staring. 'He punched me and it was on my . forehead or somewhere,' he told the court, 'but I was totally blind. It . went in one of my eyes and I just fell down.' He said he thought the attack lasted . five minutes or less but he did not know if a number of blows he . received while he was on the floor were kicks or punches and said: 'It . was just bang, bang, bang on my head.' He went on: 'He punched me or kicked . me, I can't say exactly if it was a punch or kick, but when he saw me . spitting my tooth and my mouth was bleeding he just ran off. 'He left me like that.' Mr Ali was taken to hospital by his . manager and treated for two fractures to his jaw. He also lost two teeth . and had bruises to the left temple area of his face. Prosecutor Shenaz Muzaffer told the . court a medical expert concluded that a 'moderate to severe' use of . force would have been required to cause the injuries to the jaw. She said: 'It is the Crown's case that the defendant deliberately inflicted those injuries intending to cause serious harm.' She added: 'The defendant does accept that he did have an altercation with Mr Ali but says he was acting in self defence.'","Tariq Jahan was found guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm at Birmingham Court Court after a three-day trial .

Holiday island: A spokesman for the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre said the yacht had suffered technical problems and was now motoring slowly towards Pemba, pictured . Officials said it was believed the . catamaran had suffered a motor breakdown in the ocean and had been left . without communication. It was due to arrive in Pemba later today or tomorrow. Mr Morenikeji’s brother told of his relief at the news. Carl Morenikeji said his brother Jason, 42, had lived in Mozambique for five years and ran a wind turbine company. He said: 'We received a call on Sunday to say he was on the boat which had gone missing. 'Obviously we were frantic with worry but have just been informed it has been located. 'The details are sketchy at the moment but we have been told that he is safe. 'We are delighted, it’s a massive relief.' Mr Morenikeji is a father of one who moved to Mozambique from the UK in 2007. His family is from Croydon in Surrey. South Africa's Times newspaper . reported that the search for the yacht was being aided by an EU . anti-piracy plane scrambled from Djibouti. The newspaper claimed all ships in the vicinity of Mozambique had also been warned to be on the lookout for pirate activity. The luxurious four bedroom Leopard 47 yacht is air conditioned, has a large outdoor area for al fresco dining and is equipped for water sports including Scuba diving and sea canoeing. It set sail from Pemba before Easter, captained by experienced South African skipper John Sergel. Mr Hartley, who lives in Johannesburg, said he last heard from the yacht on April 8 when Mr Sergal emailed from Mayotte to inform him the boat had suffered technical problems. The Dandelion remained in port for two more days before setting sail on April 10. Officials have warned in recent months about the increased threat posed by pirates in the Mozambican Channel. In December 2010 Somali gunmen kidnapped a Mozambican fishing trawler as it sailed in the country's northern waters. A report on the Dandelion's movements kept by officials at the Dzaoudzi Port in Mayotte confirmed it set sail at 3pm last Tuesday for the two day crossing to Pemba. The yacht made a final radio call at 6pm local time to inform the port authority it had reached open waters.

Neil Entwistle, the British man who murdered his American wife and baby daughter, is demanding a new trial on the grounds that a police search of their family home was illegal. He also claims the jury which convicted him was biased. The Nottinghamshire computer engineer was jailed for life without parole over the 2006 double killing, but his lawyers yesterday (FRI) told the Massachusetts supreme court in Boston that much of the crucial evidence heard at his trial was unlawfully obtained and should be thrown out. Entwistle, a computer engineer from Worksop, Notts, was convicted of shooting Rachel Entwistle, 27, and nine-month-old Lillian Rose as they slept in bed in the family’s rented home in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. He later fled to the UK but, alerted by his wife’s worried mother and friends who could not reach her, police twice searched the house. On the second search,they discovered both bodies lying hidden under blankets in the couple’s bed. Entwistle, now 33, was not present at yesterday’s 40-minute hearing at which his wife’s family listened intently to the evidence but left without comment. His lawyer, Stephen Maidman, said police should have obtained a search warrant before entering the house a second time. Although legal experts believe Entwistle may have a strong case, the judges hearing the appeal appeared sceptical. “Two people are missing. A baby is missing. What isn’t an emergency about that?”, said Justice Robert Cordy. Entwistle with his wife Rachel, 27, and their nine-month-old daughter Lilliam Rose. He is convicted of shooting them in a double murder . Mr Maidman acknowledged the bodies would eventually have been discovered but claimed the judges risked allowing police to violate the US Constitution’s ban on “unreasonable” searches of a citizen’s home. The lawyer also argued that jurors at Entwistle’s trial should have been questioned far more rigorously as to whether they were influenced by the huge pre-trial publicity over the case. Prosecutors told the hearing that the jury was properly vetted by the trial judge, Diane Kottmyer, and that police had acted properly when they went into the Entwistles’ home. Police are allowed to enter a home without a warrant if they have an “objectively reasonable basis’’ to believe there may be someone inside who is injured or in immediate danger, said law expert Christopher Dearborn. Prof Dearborn said there “is a very compelling argument that this was an illegal search”. Entwistle pictured in 2006, police have defended their actions and said they are allowed to enter a home on and 'objectively reasonable basis' Entwistle’s trial heard how he was unemployed, heavily in debt and lying to his wife about his job prospects while secretly looking for extra-marital sex on the internet. He claimed he panicked after finding the bodies and flew to Britain without alerting the police because he wanted to be with his parents. They continue to insist he is innocent and that Rachel Entwistle was the true killer. In 2008, prison sources said Entwistle had been tricked into shaving his head after a white supremacist skinhead gang said it would protect him after he received threats from other inmates. But the gang then admitted it was a prank that would not guarantee his safety, adding: “We’re gonna kill you, too.” Prison officials admitted the threats against Entwistle were serious and have transferred him to a prison with less dangerous inmates.","The Nottinghamshire computer engineer was jailed for life without parole in 2006 .

Dog owners in Hawaii are turning to pet psychologists to save their animals from a draconian new law that makes 'incessant barking' an offence. Hawaii's Big Island may boast idyllic scenery but it is overrun by pet dogs and the noise has prompted officials to take drastic action against repeat offenders. Police can now write barking tickets, fine noisy dog owners hundreds of dollars and even remove an uncontrollable yapper to a dog pound. Paw pooch: Dog owners in Hawaii are turning to pet psychologists to save their animals from a draconian new law that makes 'incessant barking' an offence . Following surging complaints from angry neighbours, the law in Hawaii County is quite specific on noisy dogs, banning 'barks, bays, cries, howls' that go on continuously for ten minutes or intermittently for 20 minutes within a half hour. The law still allows for a dog to bark over the allotted time limits if its owner is being attacked. Some owners have complained that the new law infringes their rights but neighbours counter that 24-hour barking is such a problem that they have to run fans next to their heads at night just to get to sleep. Owners whose dogs fall foul of the law have been allowed to get professional help as a part of a plea deal to ensure they can hang on to their animals. Experts such as Carl Oguss, who runs the East Hawaii Dog Psychology Centre, are now offering classes in 'dog whispering' where he teaches owners to make more effort to try to understand their troubled canines. Mr Oguss, a retired psychology professor, teaches that endless barking is often a result of dogs getting bored or of owners failing to communicate in a way their dogs can understand. He encourages owners to take their dogs on 'play dates' with other dogs to make their day more interesting and cut down the tendency to bark just for something to do. 'You have to focus on the cause as well as how to correct the symptoms,' he said of incessant barkers. 'In most cases, they don't really need a therapist to come to their house. [Owners] just need a little better information about communication and mutual respect with a dog.' Other parts of the U.S. are cracking down on dog barking including Los Angeles, which last year imposed a law imposing fines of as much as £630 ($1,000). As in Hawaii, a few towns have set a time limit as to how long a dog can bark before it is breaking the law. But local officials stress that Hawaii's largest island has a particular nightmare with noisy dogs. People there use dogs to hunt wild pigs and many people own at least five and some as many as 30.","Officials on Hawaii's Big Island have taken action with a new law making 'incessant barking' an offence .

The lawyers for the neighbourhood watch captain who shot Trayvon Martin in February said they are withdrawing as his counsel because he hasn't followed their legal advice and they have not heard from him in several days. Attorneys Craig Sonner and Hal Uhrig said during a news conference Tuesday that they haven't heard from George Zimmerman since Sunday, and their calls and text messages haven't been returned. Sonner said: 'I just can’t proceed to represent a client who doesn’t stay in contact with me'. Scroll down for video . Shooting: Zimmerman, left, came to national attention after the death of Trayvon Martin, right, in February . Uhrig added that the attorneys 'started reaching out in every way that we knew how to get him,' but to no avail. Zimmerman is currently in hiding, and while Sonner and Uhrig claim they don't know where he is, it's far away from Florida. Uhrig said: 'You can stop looking in Florida, you can look much further away from that'. They added that Zimmerman had . contacted the special prosecutor who will decide if he should face . charges, a move they said went against their legal advice. He also contacted Fox News host Sean Hannity without his attorney's knowledge or approval. The details surrounding that call were not immediately known. Zimmerman is at the centre of an investigation over the shooting of Martin, 17, who was killed on February 26 as he was returning from a convenience store to his father's fiancee's house. Zimmerman has claimed he shot Martin in self-defence after following him in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Martin, who was unarmed, was black. Zimmerman's father is white and his mother is Hispanic. The lack of an arrest has inspired nationwide protests and some claims of racial profiling, which Zimmerman's supporters deny. Dumped: Lawyers Craig Sonner (left) and Hal Uhrig (right) said today that they are dropping George Zimmerman as a client after they lost contact with him . Fatally shot: Some have said Zimmerman uttered a racial slur before pursuing and killing Trayvon, pictured here in 2009, in a 911 call he made to report a 'suspicious' black male . Sonner urged the media and public to not jump to conclusions about this case. He said: 'Put the facts together and I think you'll see it comes together as a self-defence case'. Both attorneys expressed belief that Zimmerman acted in self-defence in his encounter with Martin. On Sunday, a website was set up with a statement from Zimmerman where he claimed he has been 'forced to leave my home... and ultimately my entire life' as a result of the media outcry over Trayvon's shooting. The site also features a number of quotations from writers and philosophers which are apparently used as justification for Zimmerman's behaviour. Defence: George Zimmerman has set up this website to raise funds for his legal costs and living expenses . After the existence of TheRealGeorgeZimmerman.com came to light on Monday afternoon, the site received so much traffic that it became difficult to access. The site's creation comes as it has been revealed that Zimmerman will not face a grand jury in the Trayvon case, with the decision whether or not to prosecute him left to a special prosecutor alone. While his father and brother have spoken out to defend him, he has not granted any interviews himself. His new website - whose authenticity . has been confirmed by his attorneys - contains a statement referring to a . 'life-altering event which led me to become the subject of intense . media coverage'. He . continues: 'As a result of the incident and subsequent media coverage, I . have been forced to leave my home, my school, my employer, my family . and ultimately, my entire life. 'This website's sole purpose is to ensure my supporters they are receiving my full attention without any intermediaries'. Video showing Zimmerman being escorted into the Sanford police station on the night of the shooting appear to show him unhurt, but an enhanced version showed what looked like welts on the back of his head . Zimmerman goes on to criticise other so-called 'defence funds', which he says have not provided any revenue to him. The statement on the homepage concludes: 'I have created a Paypal account solely linked on this website as I would like to provide an avenue to thank my supporters personally and ensure that any funds provided are used only for living expenses and legal defence, in lieu of my forced inability to maintain employment. 'I will also personally, maintain accountability of all funds received. I reassure you, every donation is appreciated.' The site also contains a section titled 'The Facts', in which Zimmerman insists that he 'cannot discuss the details of the event on February 26th'. Controversy: The website's 'album' shows graffiti sprayed on to a black cultural centre in Ohio . Under the heading 'My Race', Zimmerman - who is half Hispanic, half white - quotes Thomas Paine saying: 'The world is my country, all mankind are my brethren, and to do good is my religion.' A section headed 'Album' features a photograph of graffiti reading 'Long live Zimmerman' which was notoriously painted on the wall of a black cultural centre at Ohio State University. Every page of the site features Edmund Burke's famous statement that 'The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil, is that good men do nothing,' as well as a link to Zimmerman's PayPal account. On the night of Martin's death, . Zimmerman, who was patrolling in the Sanford gated community, called 911 . to report a suspicious person. Protesters hold signs during a march and rally for Trayvon Martin on Saturday in Sanford where he was shot before demonstrating at the police station were Zimmerman was released . 'This guy looks like he is up to no good. He is on drugs or something,' Zimmerman told the dispatcher from his sport utility vehicle. He added that the teen had his hand in his waistband and was walking around looking at homes. 'These a*******. They always get away,' Zimmerman said on a 911 call. But Martin, 17, was not armed. He was returning from a convenience store with an iced tea for himself and a bag of skittles for his little brother. A neighbour said there had been several . break-ins in the community in the past year, including one in which . burglars took a TV and laptops. Speaking out: Trayvon's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, talked about their son's death at a recent public forum sponsored by Democrats on Capitol Hill . A dispatcher told Zimmerman to stay in his sport utility vehicle and that an officer would be there momentarily, but Zimmerman - for unknown reasons - got out. Zimmerman told police he lost sight of the teenager and was walking back to his sport utility vehicle when he was suddenly attacked. But Trayvon's girlfriend Deedee, 16, . who was on the phone with Trayvon in his last moments alive, emerged . Wednesday to add more contradiction to Zimmerman's story. She . told ABC News in a brief interview that Trayvon said he saw a strange . man following him as he walked back to his father's home. '... and then Trayvon come and said the man was still behind him and I said to him, ""Run!""' the teen said. Protests: The killing of Trayvon Martin has sparked numerous demonstrations across the country, like this one in front of the White House . He and Martin fought, according to witnesses. Zimmerman said Martin punched him in the nose and slammed his head against the ground. Zimmerman’s father Robert Zimmerman echoed those remarks on Wednesday night, telling WOFL-TV his son was being beaten by Trayvon, and the teen threatened him during the scuffle. He told the network: 'Trayvon Martin said something to the effect of ""you're going to die now or you're going to die tonight,"" something to that effect'. He added: ‘[Martin] continued to beat George and at some point, George pulled his pistol and did what he did'. Zimmerman told cops he acted in self-defense, and that he had yelled for help before firing the gun. Watch video here .

Nearly a third of five-year-olds in parts of London missed out on their first choice of primary school this year - new figures show. Statistics published by the Pan-London Admissions Board reveal that across the capital more than 20 per cent of youngsters did not get a place at their preferred school that they were hoping for. But the figures also reveal differences across the city, with children more likely to get their first choice in some areas than in others. Places: One fifth of five-year-olds in London did not get their preferred primary school place (file photo) In Kensington and Chelsea 64.9 per cent of children starting primary school this September got their preferred option, meaning 35.1 per cent of youngsters missed out. In Wandsworth 69.37 per cent of pupils got their first choice, with 30.63 per cent missing out. At the other end of the scale, 85.36 per cent of pupils in Barking and Dagenham got their first choice, along with 86.01 per cent in Tower Hamlets. Of 100,000 pupils in London applying for primary places this year, 6,220 youngsters did not get one of their choices. A spokesman for the admissions board which co-ordinates school places for London said that 78 per cent of pupils got their first choice; while 90% got one of their top three, and 94 per cent got one of their six preferences. Families across London found out on Thursday which primary school their child had got. Across England, many families will be finding out their allocation over the next few weeks. Choices: More than 100,000 London families applied for a primary school place (file photo) Possible reasons for the figures include parents only listing one school when filling in forms, and a huge demand for some popular schools, the spokesman added. Of those who didn't get the school of their choice; 4,700 have been offered an alternative, while around 1,500 currently have no school place. Pan London Admissions Board chairman Helen Jenner said: 'Co-ordinating school admissions in London has meant a fairer distribution of available offers and has resulted in more parents getting an offer from one of their preferred schools earlier. 'It is important to emphasise that although the system is very efficient, it cannot create places at schools which are already full and not all parents can be offered their first preference. 'London local authorities are working hard to try to ensure that they can offer every child a school place but with this surge in demand it is becoming increasingly difficult.'","Of 100,000 pupils in the capital, 6,220 did not get one of their choices .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:21 EST, 4 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:23 EST, 4 May 2012 . Dead: A former scandal-hit Florida tourism director, Mark Bellinger, has been found dead of a drugs overdose after leaving a suicide note . A tourism director has been found dead after an apparent drug overdose - just one day after being accused of using public funds sent by BP after the 2010 oil spill to buy a $747,000 home. Mark Bellinger, 52, had also admitted just days earlier to using tax dollars to buy a $710,000 luxury yacht - which he had falsely claimed was going to be used for county tourism promotions. Bellinger, from the Florida Panhandle, had gone missing on Thursday and was found on Friday morning in his car in Alabama. He died later in hospital, Okaloosa County Sheriff Larry Ashley said. The alarm had been raised by his wife after she found a suicide noted at their home on Thursday. Bellinger was hired as tourism director of the area in May 2010, only weeks after the massive BP oil spill began in the Gulf of Mexico. After admitting he had bought the yacht, Bellinger resigned on Tuesday and by Thursday the sheriff's office had issued an arrest warrant concerning the purchase of his $747,000 home. The house, in the gated Kelly Plantation neighbourhood of Destin, Florida, boasts four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a swimming pool, a spa and a wine room, according to Zillow.com. Property records show the home, which also overlooks a golf course, was bought last August. The money is believed to have come from BP PLC, which paid restitution to communities across the Gulf Coast so they could lure valuable tourists back to the region devastated by tar. Sheriff Ashley said the death would not end the investigation into the tourist council's spending. 'Criminal': His death comes a day after he was accused of buying this four-bedroom, three-bathroom home in Destin, Florida with $747,000 donated by BP after the 2010 oil spill . 'Even in light of this tragedy and death, we will still be working with the FBI, our white-collar crime task force and assisting the state auditor in conducting a forensic audit of all tourist development expenditures during Mr. Bellinger's tenure with the department,' he said. 'We will be determined to uncover everything dealing with tourist development, bed tax and BP oil money.' Bellinger had worked in a similar role in Palm Springs, California before taking the job in Florida. Okaloosa County leaders did not know a yacht had been bought until recently, when the vessel's title paperwork was delivered in the mail. Bellinger acknowledged he bought the yacht. Meeting with county commissioners, he . said he was trying to do his best for the county when he made the . purchase, which he said hoped would be used promotional campaigns. Luxury: He had also acknowledged buying a 44-foot, 2011 Marquis 420 SC yacht (like the one pictured) with $710,000 of tax dollars. He claimed it was going to be used for tourism promotions . But he admitted he should not have bought the yacht without prior approval. 'I did put the cart before the horse,' he said. 'It was a mistake in judgment on my part.' Commissioners immediately announced they wanted to sell the boat, which was bought in December. 'It's an embarrassment to the county to have that titled in the county's name,' Commissioner Bill Roberts said. The revelations sparked a call for an investigation from  state Senator Don Gaetz. 'The deeply troubling circumstances . in Okaloosa County raise a larger question about the uses of BP funds by . others who have received these funds,' Gaetz wrote in a letter to Govenor Rick Scott. Disaster: BP had paid restitution to communities across the Gulf Coast, including Okaloosa, so they could lure valuable tourists back to the region devastated by the 2010 oil spill, pictured . The sheriff's office announced it would be conducting an investigation into the 'unorthodox and secretive... purchase with county bed tax monies' in a press release on Friday. In September, tourism business leaders in the county held a breakfast to celebrate the region's recovery from the oil spill. At the evenet Bellinger announced the county had record tourism levels for June and July, adding: 'It was just an unbelievable summer, and I don't know how we could top this off next year, folks.'","Mark Bellinger found dead in car in Alabama day after leaving suicide note .

The freedom of the Press to hold the powerful to account should be cherished, the owner of The Independent newspaper said yesterday. Evgeny Lebedev, whose family owns the London Evening Standard, warned the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards: ‘I’ve seen the other side.’ He said that in his native Russia, corruption went unchecked because editors were constrained by Press barons who were in hock to rich businessmen. Cherish freedom: Evgeny Levedev, who owns the London Evening Standard, contrasted British press freedom with Russia . Mr Lebedev said: ‘I was born in the Soviet Union, I come from Russia, and I can see the effects of not having a free Press is having on Russia.’ He claimed more than £180billion had been siphoned out of the country by unscrupulous oligarchs, many of whom were now living in London. The head of Sky News apologised to Lord Justice Leveson yesterday for denying that the broadcaster had been involved in hacking. John Ryley (pictured) said a letter sent to the inquiry stating his staff had ‘never intercepted communications’ was wrong and ‘very regrettable’. In fact, a Sky News reporter was authorised to hack into emails on two separate occasions. The ‘victims’ included John Darwin, the ‘canoe man’ fraudster who faked his own death. But Mr Ryley pointed out that the reporter’s work had been praised by police for helping solve the case in which Darwin and his wife Anne were convicted. In the second hacking case, Mr Ryley admitted that Jeremy Darroch, the chief executive officer of BSkyB  knew about the hacking of the emails of paedophile Martin Smith. ‘Where is that money going? It may be going to fund terrorism or anywhere else. So that’s the effects of not having a free Press,’ said Mr Lebedev, whose family purchased the Standard in 2009 and The Independent a year later. He said: ‘I think one of the extraordinary things about this country is a very robust and diverse Press, and I think that has to be protected.’ He added that anyone in the media who had committed crimes should be ‘punished according to the law’. Lord Justice Leveson also heard evidence from the boss of The Daily Telegraph, who revealed that he texts David Cameron suggestions on the economy. Aidan Barclay, the chairman of the . Telegraph Media Group, also once arranged for Mr Cameron to be sent an . article about the merits of lower tax for high earners.

The nation's pride soared as marching contingents of the armed forces strode down Rajpath amid a striking display of India's military muscle power during the 63rd Republic Day parade on Thursday. But the family of martyred young army officer Lieutenant Sushil Khajuria - named a day earlier for Kirti Chakra, the second highest peacetime gallantry medal - was shattered. Not because they had lost him in the prime of his youth (he was only 26 years old). Or because his life had been cruelly cut short just a few months before he entered into wedded bliss (he was tying the knot on February 4). Lt Khajuria, pictured, died after taking bullets in a heroic gun battle with militants at Kupwara in Jammu and Kashmir in September last year . The Khajurias were feeling let down because of the appalling attitude of the authorities - the Union and state governments as well as the army - who appeared to be belittling the supreme sacrifice made by the braveheart. Sushil had breathed his last after taking bullets in a heroic gun battle with militants at Kupwara in Jammu and Kashmir on September 27 last year. His brother, Major Anil Kumar Khajuria, told Mail Today that no one from the state government had come forward to meet the family and express its support. 'It is sad that all we have from the authorities are a few condolence letters,' he said, pointing out that even the Commanding Officer of Sushil's battalion, 18 Grenadiers, had not cared to establish contact with the family. The martyred Lt Sushil Khajuria's friends and relatives had hoped that he would be awarded Ashok Chakra, the highest peacetime gallantry medal . 'Nobody bothered to reach us,' the Major lamented. Army sources, however, claimed senior officers had been in constant touch with the family. The Jammu-based Khajuria family was also dismayed by the fact that it had not heard anything about the ex gratia payment though four months had elapsed since Sushil laid down his life. 'We are not interested in the money, but it is a matter of pride and respect for us,' Anil said. The martyred Lieutenant's friends and . relatives had earlier hoped that he would be awarded Ashok Chakra, the . highest peacetime gallantry medal. A campaign was launched on social networking sites by friends so that his act of bravery received due recognition. His family was, however, content with . Kirti Chakra. Sushil was a second generation armyman. His father, Som . Datt Khajuria, retired as a naib subedar. While Anil is a serving Major, . his other brother is a para commando. With the passion for serving the . nation running in his genes, joining the army was the first and only . career option for Sushil. Enlisting in the army was not a 'job' for the . three brothers. Som Datt Khajuria, pictured centre, lays a wreath on the coffin of his martyred son Lt Sushil Khajuria . But the family feels so slighted now that it has decided not to let any of its other members don the olive green. 'Judging by how authorities have . responded to the sacrifice, we think his bravery was an act of . foolishness,' the family said, expressing anguish and anger at the . apathy of the authorities . 'It is sad that all we got from the authorities is a few letters of condolences. Nobody bothered to reach us' Majanil Kumar Khajuria, Lt Sushil Khajuria's brother . The kin of an army officer who dies in action are entitled to an ex gratia of Rs 20 lakh from the Centre and Rs 5 lakh from the state government. But the family said that all it wanted now was a small place to erect a statue in the memory of Sushil. 'There are no more expectations. We do not want to make representations and chase officials to seek compensation,' the family said. The fierce encounter that claimed Sushil's life lasted four days. It was triggered when a group of Lashkar-e-Tayyeba militants attempted to sneak through the Line of Control via the Awathkul forests near Kralpora, around 130 km north of Srinagar. Lieutenant Sushil Khajuria was born on August 28, 1985 at Samba in Jammu and Kashmir. After completing his studies in . Jammu, he got commissioned into the Indian Army after passing out from . Officer's Training Academy in Chennai in 2010. He was attached with 18 Grenadiers and as ghatak platoon commander he conducted several counter-terrorist operations in Kupwara, J&K. In an encounter in September 2011, he managed to kill a terrorist but suffered bullet injuries while trying to save the life of his colleague Havildar Ravi Kumar. He managed to kill the other terrorist too, but later succumbed to his injuries. The terrorists had sneaked in during the intervening night of September 26 and 27, but the intelligence network alerted troops in Shamasbari range to intercept them. Soldiers of 18 Grenadiers, of which Sushil was a part, and a column of police personnel belonging to the antiinsurgency Special Operations Group were dispatched to launch a cordon-and-search operation. He managed to kill one of the terrorists after making deft moves in a close-range battle. Another terrorist retaliated but the Lieutenant repulsed him, forcing a retreat. Lt Khajuria then managed to surprise the second terrorist and killed him as well. He went on to crawl to evacuate one of his injured colleagues, Havildar Ravi Kumar. In the process, he got hit and succumbed to his injuries on the third day of the gun battle. His award citation said the officer killed two terrorists before he laid down his life. 'This was his third brush with militants in a span of two months,' his brother recalled. A Jammu boy who joined the Officer's Training Academy in Chennai, Sushil was commissioned in Army Service Corps on March 20, 2009, after completing the short service course. He was, however, attached with 18 Grenadiers on a Kashmir assignment. 18 Grenadiers is one of the most decorated units of the army. It had won a Param Vir Chakra in the Kargil war and bagged six gallantry medals during this year's Republic Day function. Sushil was one of three officers named for Kirti Chakra. The other two officers are Captain Ashutosh Kumar of 5 Rajputana Rifles and Lieutenant Colonel Kamaldeep Singh of 13 Rajputana Rifles. Ashok Chakra was awarded posthumously to Lieutenant Navdeep Singh who also laid down his life fighting terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir.","Lt Sushil Khajuria, died after taking bullets in a heroic gun battle with militants at Kupwara, Jammu and Kashmir in September last year ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:46 EST, 10 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:53 EST, 10 May 2012 . Charles Baird is going off the grid for a year. The 40-year-old oil company employee and filmmaker from Anchorage will move to the mostly uninhabited Latouche Island in Alaska's Prince William Sound at the end of May, completing a dream he's been contemplating for 17 years. Baird will build a 12 foot by 12 foot shed to shelter him from the elements, and he plans to hunt and fish and fend off an occasional black bear during his sojourn to the Alaska wilderness. Charles Baird poses at a sportsman store in Anchorage, Alaska. Baird plans to live on Latouche Island in Alaska's Prince William Sound for a year homesteading and filming his adventure . He'll be incommunicado, only allowing himself to send short messages out via a satellite uplink to his Facebook page and no way to receive any in. He won't even know who won the November presidential election for six months. He calls his experiment more modern-day homesteading than a survival game, but he's heading into the adventure well-armed. ‘I may see some hunters and fishermen come by but otherwise I will be on my own, just me and my dog,’ said Baird. Latouche Island is a narrow strip of land (12 miles long, 3 miles wide) located about 100 miles southwest of the port city of Valdez. Like many islands in Prince William Sound, people digging into the beach there can still find oil from the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill. The now abandoned Latouche city site once was home to 4,000 people, thanks to copper mining. The mine closed in 1930, and now the island is dotted with occasional seasonal cabins and not much else. The island is mostly used for subsistence hunting. Baird plans to live in cabin he will build himself and is bringing his dog along for company . Kate and Andy McLaughlin live in Chenega Bay, a village six miles away on Evans Island, and own a cabin on Latouche. Kate McLaughlin doesn't know Baird, but has heard his story many times. In fact, she's written a book about people coming to Alaska to live the remote lifestyle and is in the process of trying to find a publisher. ‘We've seen several people of his ilk try to come out and say, `We're going to build a cabin, we're going to live out here and do it,'‘ said Mrs McLaughlin. ‘It's tough.’ Some abandoned supplies from those people making earlier attempts can still be found strewn on the beach. The challenges of Latouche Island are numerous, and foremost is the weather. ‘You're fighting the cold or the mold,’ said Mrs McLaughlin of the seemingly constant precipitation, snow and rain. Baird said the island has anywhere from 80-120 inches of snow in a typical winter, along with 70 inches of rain a year. The McLaughlins' two-story cabin on the beach had snow up to the roof this winter. ‘It's wet, things don't dry out,’ said Dave Janka, who owns Auklet Charter Services in Cordova. ‘You get lots of snow.’ Much like Cordova, he called Latouche Island ‘paradise with rain.’ ‘Heavy weather is going to be a constant companion,’ said RJ Kopchak, a Cordova businessman and former commercial fisherman. ‘That's what happens there.’ Another problem? Black bears. There's a large bear population on the island, and McLaughlin says they ‘love to get into trouble.’ Wellesley Glacier in College Fjord: Even though Baird is a resident of Anchorage he has no experience of living along in such a remote location as Latouche Island in Alaska's Prince William Sound . Baird said he'll be safe from the bears. He'll carry a .44 with him at all times, has a shotgun ‘and a few other weapons, as well.’ The dog will also alert him to any predators. There are building restrictions on the uninhabited island, Baird said, so he will have to construct his makeshift cabin without digging into the ground for a foundation. He plans to have lumber delivered to build his cabin, which will be located about a third of a mile from the beach, about 150 feet up a hill. He'll have plentiful fishing opportunities. ‘The nice thing about the ocean is twice a day you've got a dinner table set out for you,’ said Janka. The challenges don't faze Baird, who is ex-military, except perhaps for one. Baird will return to civilization in at the end of April 2013 when he will discover for the first time who won the U.S Presidential election . ‘Probably the biggest challenge is the isolation,’ said Baird, adding it was an issue for some of his classmates in an Air Force Academy survival training course. Some ‘did experience hallucinations and even group delusions, just minor things. But it is kind of a concern, being alone that long,’ explained Baird. He said he's worked with psychologists at Harvard and the University of Chicago, talking through the things he can expect, like nightmares. ‘I think I'll be OK, I've done a lot of work on my own, and I'll also have a dog, which probably will help keep things stabilized,’ said Baird. Sunset Prince William Sound: Baird feels the biggest challenge will be the loneliness . He also plans to keep busy by reading, taking a couple thousand books on an electronic reader. He'll keep it charged with wind and solar systems he's taking with him. Baird is planning to keep a diary, which could be turned into a book. He's also thinking of writing an instructional book of how to live in the remote wilderness. Then there's also the filming, day in and day out, of his experiences alone on the Alaska island. Once he returns to civilization, he'll edit the video and try to sell it as a documentary series. Baird is not the first to make or film such an odyssey. Dick Proenneke lived alone in a remote cabin and kept journals published as the classic Alaska memoir ‘One Man's Wilderness.’ He moved to his cabin in 1968 at the age of 52. Proenneke lived alone until 1998 in what is now Lake Clark National Park and Preserve. He also filmed his adventures, which have been turned into DVDs and were aired on PBS. He died in 2003.","Latouche Island in Prince William Sound can receive up to 10 feet of snow in winter .

Emergency plans to relax border checks are being drafted by ministers to ease the crisis engulfing Britain’s airports. David Cameron has ordered the Home Office to consider reintroducing less strict security checks for ‘trusted’ passengers. The aim is to cut queues of up to three hours at passport control before spectators from all over the world arrive at the Olympics. The fiasco has become increasingly . embarrassing in the run-up to the Olympics, prompting fears that Britain . will become a laughing stock as half-a-million spectators arrive here . from around the world. Managers at Stansted Airport in Essex were the latest to blast the 'unacceptable' delays for affecting passengers. Sources said the ‘risk-based approach’ would include relaxation of passport checks for British and European travellers, as well as faster queues for passengers who did not require visas and so-called ‘trusted travellers’ – foreign businessmen who visit regularly and frequent fliers. The vast majority of non-EU nationals would continue to face full vetting. The move would represent a partial U-turn after Home Secretary Theresa May last year ordered full-scale checks for every arrival. In a major immigration scandal - and . unknown to ministers - guards were told not to bother checking biometric . chips on passports of non-EU citizens or their fingerprints or other . personal details against the Home Office's so-called Warnings Index of . terror suspects and illegal immigrants.

A Whitehall source said: 'We want to introduce ""risk-based"" checks but it's important that it's done step-by-step and with the full authorisation of ministers. 'Any repeat of last year's fiasco would be a nightmare.'

Passport control queues: The fiasco has prompted fears that Britain will become a laughing stock as half-a-million spectators arrive here from around the world for the Olympics . Last week it was revealed that passengers were storming past border guards at Britain's airports in frustration at lengthy queues at passport control. Trade unions claimed that customs staff had been switched from checking for drugs and arms smuggling and instead were helping check travel documents. Paul O'Connor, the Home Office national manager for the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), said the cut in border controls had led to an increase in small-scale drug smuggling into the UK. The Home Office vehemently denied the claim. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'This border chaos isn't just another government shambles, it is now becoming a security risk. 'Theresa May needs to investigate these breaches urgently, and make sure security is being maintained. 'She needs to make sure that appropriate customs checks are still taking place and that panic action to staff the passport desks is not leaving customs completely empty.'","David Cameron orders Home Office to consider reintroducing less strict security checks .

A father has spoken out about a cruel condition that has robbed his daughter of her ability to walk and talk, after scientists made a breakthrough that could lead to a cure. Marc Souter's daughter Dylan was born in July 2009 and by the time she was one had learned to crawl and say a few words and was poised to start walking. Dylan had learned how to pull herself upright when she was one (left) but then her development started to regress and she stopped speaking and trying to walk  (right) 'She was like any other little girl,' Mr Souter, 36, said. 'She was hitting all her milestones and crawling around making a nuisance of herself pulling things off surfaces.' But then Dylan's development faltered before going into reverse. Marc and wife Jenny, 36, could only watch as she became confused and withdrawn. She stopped crawling and suffered from terrible headaches and muscular pain. 'We were told not to worry at first but I could see she was losing lots of skills,' Mr Souter said. 'The last time she said Da Da she was 14 months old. She hasn't spoken since.' 'The worst thing was when she stopped looking up and smiling at me when I came into the room.' Dylan, 2, with her mother Jenny and older brother Drew on Mother's Day, 2012. Dylan becomes frustrated that she can't speak or move easily . Shortly after her second birthday a genetic test revealed Dylan had Rett Syndrome - a severe autism spectrum disorder that affects . roughly one in 10,000 girls. It is caused by mutations in the gene MECP2 found on the X chromosome. While boys with the disease only survive a few weeks, most girls with the condition only start displaying symptoms after their first year. 'Girls with the condition are not brain-damaged,' Mr Souter, from Richmond, said. 'But they have a single faulty gene that condemns them to be locked inside their own bodies.' Marc with daughter Dylan when she was developing normally . While many girls with Retts survive into adulthood they need 24hour-care. There is no known cure. But now scientists have made a breakthrough that could combat the devastating condition using bone marrow transplants. 'It's such a horrible, brutal condition so the fact there could be a potential treatment fills us with a mixture of hope and elation,' Mr Souter said. Scientists from the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville, speculated that the brain-dwelling immune cells called microglia are defective in those with the syndrome. To test this theory they treated Rett mice with radiation to kill off their existing brain immune cells, before injecting them with healthy bone marrow cells to boost their immune systems. Male Rett mice, with no working copy of . Mecp2, typically die within two months, but the ones that received bone . marrow from healthy mice lived up to a year, according to study author Jonathan Kipnis. Rett Syndrome is a debilitating autism disorder which most often strikes previously healthy little girls just after they have learned to walk and say a few words and begins to drag their development backwards.Girls lose acquired skills, normal movement and speech. They are left unable to communicate or use their hands to hold, carry or manipulate objects. Eventually they are locked into their own bodies. They can suffer from extreme anxiety, disordered breathing and seizures. Scoliosis - curving of the spine - is common. Most survive into adulthood but need 24hour care. There are no real treatments and no current cure. However, in 2007 scientists first showed they could reverse some of the symptoms in mice by stimulating the healthy copy of the Mecp2 gene. The latest research published in Nature in 2012 showed success by treating the brain-dwelling immune cells called microglia. For more information visit www.reverserett.org.uk . The treated . mice breathed easier, walked better and gained more weight compared with . untreated mice. Female mice with just one working copy of Mecp2 develop . Rett symptoms later than male mice, but a bone-marrow transplant . improved gait, breathing and weight gain for them, too. 'If we show the immune system is playing . a very important role in Rett patients and we could replace it in a . safe way, we may develop some feasible therapies in the future,' Dr Kipnis told nature.com. Clinical trials of bone-marrow transplants may be worth trying and drugs that improve microglia function are both in the pipeline. 'We know it's not a cure but at last we can see a path for clinical treatment,' Mr Souter said. 'Dylan's future is so bleak and we would do anything if it would help her.' He said his daughter today is generally happy but becomes frustrated because she can't communicate easily or play with her toys. She has started crawling slowly after undergoing physiotherapy and hydrotherapy and uses her eyes to point at things, but Mr Souter says these small victories don't blind them to the fact Dylan will deteriorate. 'Dylan is a real fighter. Every day she is trying so hard,' he said. 'Her older brother, Drew, is four and he asks us every day when Dylan is going to walk and talk. He is so caring and understands something is 'squeezing her brain.' 'But now he wants to know why she is so ill and we say it's just very bad luck. There's nothing else we can say.' The U.S study has been published in Nature1. It was funded by Rett Syndrome Research Trust UK. The charity receives no government or lottery funding and relies on private donations to continue its research.

Cold case no more: Oral Stuart Jr was 18 when his nude body was found on November 10, 1974 . A body found naked in 1974 at a . California apartment complex is a U.S. Marine from Iowa who had been . listed as a deserter from Camp Pendleton, police revealed yesterday. The man known for more than 37 years as 'John Doe No. 155' is Oral Stuart Jr of Des Moines, Long Beach police said in a statement. His cause of death, previously listed as undetermined, has been reclassified as a homicide. The body of Stuart, who was 18 when he disappeared, was found on November 10, 1974, in the carport area of a condominium complex near Interstate 605, police said. Twelve days later, Marine officials at Camp Pendleton some 50 miles to the south declared him a deserter. Police looking into cold cases with a grant from the National Institute of Justice came to suspect the body may be a member of the military because of the man's tattoos and haircut. Stuart reportedly had a Marine tattoo on his shoulder, but it's unclear how investigators could not make the connection sooner. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service found that tattoos on the body matched those described in records on Stuart, and surviving family members confirmed his identity through photographs. Relatives told investigators that Stuart, who they knew as 'Buddy,' never would have voluntarily deserted. Mystery: Oral Stuart Jr vanished from Camp Pendleton in Southern California and had been branded a deserter by the Marine Corps . Marked: Stuart had a Marine tattoo on his shoulder when he was found dead at a carport in this apartment complex, but cops failed to make the connection . 'My parents both went to their graves not knowing what had happened to him and knowing they listed him as a deserter,' Carl Stuart of Phoenix, the victim's older brother and one of his few surviving relatives, told the Long Beach Press-Telegram. 'Now I know he didn't desert, he was taken from us. But I've known that all along'. Killer: Oral Stuart's brother believes the Marine may have been murdered by Randy Kraft, who's on death row . Carl Stuart said he believes his . brother may have been the victim of a serial killer. Speaking to CBS 5 in Phoenix, Mr . Stuart implicated California's notorious 'Freeway Killer' Randy Kraft, who . murdered at least 16 people between 1971 and 1983. Many of his victims . were members of the military. Kraft was convicted in 1989, and is currently on death row at San Quentin prison. Stuart's original autopsy from 1974 . showed blunt force trauma and other injuries, but coroner's . investigators said it was not clear how Stuart received them. Police have not named any suspects or identified a possible motive for the killing. They are seeking the public's help. Unlike many cold cases, where modern DNA technology is used to identify victims and criminals, Stuart was identified with techniques that were available at the time his body was found. Police in 1974 also suspected the victim was from the military, but it was not clear why investigators were unable to identify him. Outrage: Stuart was identified with techniques that were available at the time his body was found near this parking lot . 'Most of the coroner's files and our files from that time are missing,' police Lt Lloyd Cox told the Press-Telegram. Stuart's brother wasn't satisfied with that answer. Carl Stuart said: 'I always believed something must have happened to him. He loved the Marine Corps'. Watch video here .","Body of Oral Stuart Jr found on November 10, 1974 .

Four U.S. soldiers were killed by a suicide bomber today as they took pictures and went sightseeing in an Afghanistan park. Witnesses said the bomber walked up to the troops, who had been warned by locals 'not to roam around the city', screamed 'Allahu Akbar' and then detonated a suicide vest. Four civilians and two Afghan policemen were also killed in the midday explosion in the northern city of Maymana. It is the latest in a string of attacks, as militants continue trying to undermine U.S. efforts to to build up the Afghan military and leave combat duties to local forces by the end of 2014. Blast: Four Afghan police officers and one other NATO force soldier were also killed, and dozens wounded, in the midday explosion in the northern city of Maimanah . Graphic video footage of the scene of the attack, available on YouTube, showed what appeared to be dead Afghan civilians, police and foreign troops at the explosion site. Body parts were strewn around the gate and on the ground, and blood was spattered everywhere. Faryab is relatively calm, but considered to be a stronghold of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, an Al Qaeda affiliated group most active in the northern provinces of Afghanistan. On March 26, a joint Afghan and coalition force killed the group's leader in Afghanistan Makhdum Nusrat and detained two other insurgents. The coalition said Nusrat had been leading attacks against Afghan and coalition troops in the north for the past eight months and was plotting the assassination of a member of parliament in Kabul. The IMU was formed in 1991, originally aiming to set up an Islamic state in Uzbekistan, which borders Afghanistan. Ongoing: It is the latest in a string of attacks, as militants continue trying to undermine U.S. efforts to to build up the Afghan military and leave combat duties to local forces by the end of 2014 . Later it expanded its goal to seeking an Islamic state across Central Asia. Militants have also stepped up their attacks against international and Afghan troops nationwide in recent weeks. Nine Afghan policemen were killed and 11 abducted across the nation in the past three days. Fighting in Afghanistan usually wanes during the winter months as Taliban fighters take a break because of winter weather, only to surge in the spring. Heavy snow covers many of the mountain passes used by the Taliban and other insurgent fighters to cross mainly into eastern Afghanistan from safe havens in neighbouring Pakistan. Explosion: A motorbike-riding suicide bomber killed at least 10 people, including two U.S. soldiers, when he detonated a bomb outside a park in Afghanistan today . Anger against foreign forces has also risen following a series of missteps, including the inadvertent burning of copies of the Muslim holy book and other religious materials in February and the massacre of 17 Afghan civilians allegedly by a rogue U.S. soldier. Foreign troops also have found themselves increasingly targeted. So far this year, 97 NATO service members have been killed in Afghanistan, including at least 52 Americans. Germany and Norway, who have troops in the region, said that none of their soldiers were involved. Germany commands alliance operations in the region.

Hoaxer: Crazed Ghulam Kibria, 33, from Bradford, caused panic after he sent a chilling bomb threat to the MI5's website . A scorned husband who tried to get his estranged wife arrested by emailing MI5 and claiming she had planted a bomb at a junior school was jailed for 16 months today. Crazed Ghulam Kibria, 33, caused panic after he sent a chilling bomb threat to the security service’s website . He pretended to be his wife when he clicked on the MI5 'contact us' section of the site and wrote: 'There is a bomb planted in Prince Albert Junior and Infant School in Aston. 'There is nothing you can do - we can strike anytime, anywhere.' Anti-terror police evacuated all 700 pupils and 110 staff at the school in Birmingham just seven minutes after receiving the email on November 8 last year. Kibria was jailed for 16 months after he pleaded guilty to communicating a bomb hoax. Sentencing him at Birmingham Crown Court Judge John Maxwell said: 'The motive, we can be quite clear, was not to disrupt the school, to disrupt the neighbourhood, the motive was one of malice against the ex-wife to get her into trouble . 'You lived a perfectly respectable life until your life was turned upside down by an extremely unhappy marriage. 'You genuinely believe that your wife has committed great evil against you and so is the depth of your belief in that it has pushed you into a mental illness. 'You decided to get revenge against your ex-wife and you decided to issue a bomb hoax in her name and the motive simply that you were trying to get her arrested. 'It caused great fear. There was nothing short of panic. It was an offence that was inspired by malice and revenge.' Kibria sent the email, which included the name and address of his ex-wife, to MI5 at 1.53pm. By 2pm all staff and pupils had been evacuated and police put a 100m exclusion zone around the school after the threat was taken 'considerably seriously' by MI5, the court heard. Children as young as three were carried outside in the freezing temperatures after the evacuation came while pupils changed for a PE lesson. The court heard a 100-metre police cordon was set up around the school following the threat and two search teams of six officers in each were deployed to the school, along with an explosive detection dog and handler. Alert: Seven minutes after Kibria's email staff and pupils at Prince Albert Junior and Infant School in Aston, Birmingham, had been evacuated . Anti-terrorism officers swooped on Kibria’s ex-wife’s home who denied sending the threat. Officers arrested Kibria in Lidget Green, Bradford and seized his laptop which proved he had sent the message to MI5. Kathryn Roughton, prosecuting, told the court, Kibria harboured a 'very profound and deep seated sense of resentment' towards his ex-wife. Regan Beggs, defending, said Kibria had suffered psychiatric difficulties but was not on medication when he sent the email. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Inspector Neil Corrigan said: 'We take hoax bomb reports very seriously and will always work to bring offenders before the courts. 'Kibria’s actions wasted a significant amount of police time and resources, and could have taken officers away from more urgent matters. 'It also caused considerable inconvenience to teachers, pupils and parents at the school. 'We hope the fact that Kibria has been given a custodial sentence will act as a warning to others not to act so irresponsibly.'","Crazed Ghulam Kibria, 33, caused panic after he sent a chilling bomb threat to the security service’s website .

A police officer accused of Tasering to death a black ex-Marine is due to appear before a court in a separate $10million racism and brutality case. Anthony Carelli is accused of attacking Kenneth Chamberlain Sr, 67, after he accidentally triggered a medical alert in his sleep. The former marine was shot by a stun gun and beanbag guns as officers arrived at his apartment in White Plains, New York. He died the same day. Accused: Anthony Carelli who is accused of Tasering to death a black ex-Marine is also facing court in a brutality and racism case . Battered: The injuries Jereis Hatter allegedly suffered as he was 'beaten' by police . Tasered: Kenneth Chamberlain, pictured in his days as a Marine, was allegedly unarmed when he was shot by police . Carelli is also one of six police officers accused of beating two brothers as they were arrested - and describing them as 'rag heads' in 2008, the New York Post reported. Jerry Hatter, who is of Jordanian descent, was left with a black eye after allegedly being beaten by officers in 2008. His brother Salameh Hatter was also attacked. The brutality case - unrelated to the death of Kenneth Chamberlain Snr - is due to go before a court on April 23. The brothers claim they were handcuffed to a pole in a police station and beaten with batons. Although no criminal charges were ever brought, the pair are taking action in the civil courts. The pair claim they did not resist arrest. As it was revealed that Carelli is to appear in court, union officials called for him to . get a fair hearing over the death of Mr Chamberlain Snr who was shot in . the early hours of November 19. Police had withheld Carelli's name since he fired the shots last autumn. He now faces an anxious wait to see if he will be indicted by a grand jury over the shooting. Kenneth Chamberlain's son Kenneth Jnr told the New York Daily News: 'I’m for (Officer) Carelli getting a fair hearing. 'Let the facts speak for themselves. But did my father get a fair hearing? No, he (Carelli) played judge and . executioner right then and there.” The victim, who had also worked as a correction officer, died in hospital hours after he was Tasered. At . first officers said the shooting was 'justified' as self-defence . because the 'deranged' victim had first attacked officers with a hatchet . and knife. But, four months later, a grand jury is now being convened to look into alleged inconsistencies in the record of the involved officers' version of events. Victim: Kenneth Chamberlain Sr, 67, who was shot twice with a Taser by officer Carelli . This is because fresh evidence, in the form of a recording from medical alert company LifeAid purporting to reveal everything said inside the apartment, has come to light. Two videos which capture some of the incident, from a building security camera and also attached to a stun gun used by the police, have also emerged. Lawyers for Chamberlain's son, Kenneth Jr, say police were called to the sleeping 68-year-old's housing project home in the early hours of the morning. He had accidentally triggered his LifeAid pendant and then failed to respond to calls. On arrival he told officers banging on . his door they were not needed. But they heard banging come from the . apartment and thought someone could be in serious danger. An hour-long stand-off ensued and he became more agitated as he saw armed police arriving. On . the recording an officer is apparently heard screaming 'I don't give a . f*** n*****, open the door', a second yells 'I need to use your bathroom . to pee', while others taunted him about his military background. Claims: A chronically ill heart patient died after police officers - called to deal with a medical emergency - burst into his home and Tasered him twice in the chest (file picture) On one of the videos, police are . shown prying part of the door open. A metal object, which could be what . police thought was a hatchet, slips through the gap and falls in the . hallway. They remove the . hinges to the door and, on entering the flat, see Chamberlain standing . in his boxer shorts, with his arms at his side and hands empty. Family lawyer Mayo Bartlett, a former . Westchester assistant district attorney, told the New York Daily News: . 'The minute they got in the house, they didn’t even give him one . command. 'They never mentioned 'putyour hands up.' They never told him to lay down on the bed. The first thing they did . ... you could see the Taser light up ... and you could see it going . directly toward him.' Uproar: The case is similar, some say, to the killing of Trayvon Martin (left) by George Zimmerman (right) which sparked outrage because the latter has never been arrested . Almost 200,000 people have signed an online petition demanding justice in the case. Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore confirmed a grand jury will begin hearing evidence in the case this month. The outrage follows the shooting of black teen Trayvon Martin, 17, who was gunned down by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, 28, in February. Zimmerman claims he acted in self-defence after being sucker-punched by the teen in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. The fact Zimmerman was never arrested has sparked outrage across the country and roiled race relations. Tens of thousands of protesters have marched at rallies across the U.S. Confusion now surrounds exactly what happened - with details emerging of the gunman's criminal past, and Trayvon's history of truancy, drugs and graffiti.","Anthony Carelli accused of killing Kenneth Chamberlain Sr, 68, who was allegedly shot by stun and beanbag guns .

Natalie Wood drowned in mysterious . circumstances sometime after the evening of November 28, 1981, when the . 43-year-old actress was boating off Catalina Island with Robert Wagner . and actor Christopher Walken. Heated argument: Courtney Wagner, pictured with her father Robert Wagner in 2007, was reportedly involved in a screaming row when neighbours heard a weapon discharge . Wagner - a former jewellery designer - was just seven years old when her mother died. Speaking in a 2004 interview, she recounted her memory of the tragedy and coping with the aftermath. She said: 'I don't remember very much about my mother. I do remember her laugh and . the way she smelt, and I remember her hands - things like that that made . me feel close to her. '(After her death) My father and I . and my sisters started travelling a lot. We went to Switzerland and . spent a lot of time there, which I think was important. 'I think that . everything Dad did then - like not being around this crazed atmosphere . in LA with the paparazzi - was a good idea. It brought us all closer . together. And I always had compassion and respect for him for keeping . the family together - it could easily have fallen apart.' The mysterious nature of Natalie Wood's death prompted claims she was the victim of homicide. Just last year Los Angeles police re-opened their investigation into her death, citing 'substantial new evidence' led them to re-open their investigation into . her death. But in January they announced that there was nothing to suggest foul play and ruled the death an accident. Mother: Natalie Wood, pictured with husband Robert Wagner in 1980, drowned while boating off Catalina Island a year later . The evening before the drowning, Wood, . Wagner and Walken, who was Wood's co-star in the film 'Brainstorm,' had . dinner at a restaurant on the island. According to ship Captain Dennis .

A furious Robert Wagner shouted 'Do . you want to f*** my wife' at Walken as he smashed a bottle of wine in . the moments before Natalie Wood fell overboard, Mr Davern claimed. The captain told the officers when he . showed up on the open deck where Woods and Wagner had been arguing, Mr . Davern said 'Wagner was present, and he stood near the far rear wall of . the yacht.'

Around one million homeowners were hit by a sharp rise in mortgage repayments yesterday. Families described the increase in standard variable rate loans by the Halifax, the Co-op and Yorkshire Bank as a ‘disaster’. Lenders came under fire for the rises as the Bank of England has not changed the base rate, currently at a historic low of  0.5 per cent, for more than three years. Troubling times: Britain's biggest mortgage lender Halifax will push up borrowing rates today which will affect 184,000 borrowers . Research from Which? found homeowners saw the price rises as ‘devastating’, leaving them with an extra bill of around £300million over the next 12 months. For a customer with a £150,000 loan, the increase by the Halifax will add an extra £40 a month, or £480 a year. The bank, which was rescued from the brink of collapse by Lloyds in 2008, is raising its SVR from 3.5 per cent to 3.99 per cent, a move which will hit around 850,000 of its three million mortgage customers. Which? chief executive Peter Vicary-Smith said one in seven customers were ‘already struggling with their repayments’, even before the price rise comes into effect. The biggest losers will be the so-called ‘mortgage prisoners’ – those who cannot switch their loan to a rival bank, which means they have to pay the higher rate. Standard variable rates are the name given to mortgage lenders benchmark cost of borrowing. This is typically the rate that borrowers move onto once their initial fixed or tracker rate deal has ended. In the past it was also often the rate at which home owners took out extra borrowing, or in some cases a simple mortgage deal offered, although this use of an SVR has all but ceased at many lenders now. Crucially, lenders can raise (or lower) standard variable rates as they like, independent of changes to the Bank of England's base rate. In contrast, tracker mortgages will only move with the base rate and a fixed rate is guaranteed for as long as that deal lasts. Around 40 per cent of the 3,400 polled by Which? said higher mortgage repayments would mean they have to ‘cut back on regular spending’, while one in ten would ‘not have enough for essentials’. Mr Vicary-Smith said: ‘These SVR rises are the consequence of the lack of competition in the market, and the failure of the Government to take action to promote competition.’ Experts warned other lenders were likely to follow suit in the coming weeks. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said it was wrong to assume banks can borrow money to hand out in mortgages at the Bank of England’s 0.5 per cent base rate. A spokesman said: ‘People tend to assume the cost of funds to lenders equates to the base rate, but this is not the case. It is telling that the average rate being paid to new savers on time deposits has gone up from about 2.5 per cent a year ago to about 3 per cent now. Effectively, the cost to the lender of borrowing money from savers has risen.’ The Co-op SVR rate rose 0.5 percentage points to 4.74 per cent and the Yorkshire Bank 0.36 points to 4.95 per cent. Rates rise: Mortgage brokers anticipate that small and medium-sized lenders will be the next group to push up interest rates . By Simon LambertMortgage lenders have claimed that the cost of funding mortgages has increased significantly and used this to justify their rate rises. Many borrowers struggle to understand how mortgages that have already been lent out many years ago can suffer from an increase in the cost of funding. However, this is due to the fact that with variable rate mortgages, ie SVRs and trackers, lenders balance their books on an ongoing basis.  So, despite the fact that your mortgage may have been issued five years ago, your lender must balance the outstanding amount on its books at the end of every day. A number of things influence this: the cost of funding on the wholesale money markets, the cost of getting funds in from savers and also the amount of capital regulators demand banks hold against their loans. While the Bank of England base rate has remained at a rock bottom 0.5 per cent, banks and building societies must pay about 3 per cent rate to attract new cash from easy access savers and last year saw the benchmark money market cost of variable rate funding LIBOR rise as the eurozone debt crisis sent everyone running for cover. House prices have fallen year-on-year for the 15th month in a row, official figures showed today. Prices dropped by 0.6 per cent both annually and on a monthly basis in March, pushing the average house price in England and Wales to £160,372, the Land Registry said. The figures were released on the same day that more than a million home owners saw the cost of their mortgage payments go up, following a string of rate rise announcements from lenders, who have blamed the weak economy and the increased cost of funding a mortgage. The majority of those affected are Halifax customers, who could typically find themselves paying nearly £200 extra a year, with the Co-operative Bank, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank also among those who have made increases. The North East recorded the biggest monthly house price rise, with a 5.6 per cent increase pushing average prices to £101,676, although on a year-on-year basis, prices in the region decreased by 2.8 per cent. London, which has recorded relatively strong increases as the rest of the market remains patchy, saw a 1.8 per cent monthly fall, taking typical prices to £343,522, although the English capital recorded the strongest annual rise, at 0.7 per cent. The annual price change for London, which has had strong interest from overseas buyers, has not fallen below zero since September 2009. Wales recorded the biggest monthly and annual house price falls, with drops of 4.1 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively, taking the typical price to £113,036. The financial authorities are also tightening up on how much capital banks must hold, thus raising funding costs. However, while all this means that lenders are telling the truth when they say that the cost of funding mortgages has risen, crucially they are also opting to maintain their healthy profit margins and squeeze borrowers to cover their extra costs. In fact, while LIBOR did rise sharply last year from about 0.8 per cent at the start of August to almost hit 1.09 per cent in January 2012, it has since dropped back steadily and now stands at 1.01 per cent. (It is crucial to remember though that LIBOR is just a theoretical rate and not all institutions can borrow at this cost, those the market judges as shaky will pay more.) Meanwhile, that 3 per cent to attract savers has been the norm for a long time and the increase in capital requirements is a well signposted and gradual course. In reality, this squeeze is about two things: firstly lenders are trying to shore up their defences against the ongoing rumblings of the eurozone debt crisis and its fallout, secondly this is all part of the process of rebuilding their finances after the credit crunch-driven financial crisis. Both of these things will continue for many years to come and it will be borrowers who foot the bill for repairing the damage done to banks and building societies by their own mismanagement during the easy credit boom years. Borrowers need to do everything they can to protect themselves from this and not simply rely on their lender helping them out. The safe places to be are tracker rates and fixed rates, which banks and building societies cannot hike at will. Without that guarantee, borrowers at the mercy of the whims of banks who will be needing to find the cash to pay the bill for their past mistakes for many years to come.","850,000 Halifax borrowers affected by move that will see many mortgage repayments rise by £40 a month .

Side-by-side: In reality, the Galaxy Tab (right) is far narrower than the Apple's iPad (left) Apple is one participant in a web of litigation among phone makers and software firms over who owns patents used in smartphones, as rivals aggressively rush into the smartphone and tablet market. Complicating things between Apple and Samsung is the pair's $5billion-plus commercial relationship, which some analysts think might be at risk. Samsung, for instance, counts Apple as its biggest customer, making chips and other parts central to Apple's mobile devices. The well-reviewed Galaxy Tab 10.1 was only recently launched in Europe and is in the early stages of being rolled out. For now, the iPad is the market leader. Competing products including Research In Motion's PlayBook and Motorola's Xoom have received lukewarm reviews, while Hewlett Packard's TouchPad is a late entrant in the market, which already has more than 100 devices, mostly running on Android. Meanwhile, a U.S. trade agency is also set to review Apple's patent-infringement complaint against Taiwanese phone market HTC Corp. Apple had said Samsung's Galaxy line of . mobile phones and tablets 'slavishly' copied the iPhone and iPad. It has . sued in the U.S., Australia and elsewhere. But a Dusseldorf regional court . yesterday said it was questionable whether its authority extended to . international companies operating outside Germany, so it restricted a . preliminary ban imposed last week on Samsung Electronics to Germany. Samsung's Galaxy Tab line of tablet . computers is considered the most credible alternative to Apple's iPad, . which has taken the market by storm, selling about 30million since its . launch a year and a half ago. Apple and others have moved . aggressively to defend their intellectual property in maturing markets, . especially against Google's Android software platform, on which the new . Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet is built. Android, a latecomer to the mobile . market, has become a target by rapidly turning into the world's most . popular smartphone platform. Google is relatively defenceless because it owns few wireless patents, in contrast to older rivals. However, Google yesterday announced a . deal to buy Motorola Mobility, the descendant company of cellular phone . pioneer Motorola, for $12.5billion, largely for its vast patent . library. The Dusseldorf court said its ban . still applied to Germany, and also to the German unit of Samsung, . Samsung GmbH, throughout the European Union. A hearing in the case is now due next week. Samsung said in a statement: 'We look . forward to the opportunity to reassert our intellectual property rights . at the hearing scheduled on August 25.'

China has paved the way for  an end to the diplomatic stand-off with the United States over blind dissident Chen Guangcheng by saying he can apply to study abroad. In a ‘nudge’ to Beijing to speed up granting Chen freedom to travel, the US state department said he had been offered a fellowship by a US university and that it would provide visas for the activist and his family. The US added that it ‘expected’ China to allow them to leave soon. Chen Guangcheng is taken to hospital accompanied by U.S. State Department legal advisor Harold Koh, left, and U.S. ambassador Gary Locke, right, on Wednesday . Chen's thrilling story of fleeing from house arrest to the U.S. embassy has emerged. An account of his daring mission in The New York Times reveals that Chen was bundled into a US embassy car after his car was chased down by Chinese agents. A . bruised and bloodied Chen, who had climbed over several walls in . escaping his guards, hid out at several of his friends' houses before . deciding to go to the U.S. embassy. He . was due to be driven by a friend to rendezvous with U.S. officials, but . as the two cars were about to meet, the Americans noticed Chinese . security tailing each car. The . car carrying Chen swerved into an alley and he was bundled into the . embassy car. As it drove off, the two Chinese vehicles gave chase, but . the U.S. driver managed to shake them off. Once they made it to the embassy, American diplomats imposed a media blackout, preventing any knowledge of Chen's presence. China’s face-saving offer partially . lifted the shadow over Beijing talks between US Secretary of State . Hillary Clinton and Chinese President Hu Jintao. But some analysts urged caution over a . quick resolution to the issue, saying China’s leaders fear that being . soft on Chen, 40, could unleash more challenges to their Communist rule. Human rights lawyer Tang Jitian warned . that the authorities could easily hold up the paperwork to delay Chen . leaving the country. ‘We can’t be 100 per cent optimistic,’ he said. Chen, who campaigned against forced . abortions under China’s  ‘one-child’ policy, humiliated the Beijing . authorities by escaping house arrest and seeking refuge in the US . embassy. He stayed for six days until Wednesday, when the Chinese government gave assurances on the safety of him and his family. He is now being treated in hospital for a broken foot, an injury he received as he scaled a wall round his house. He is under guard while his family is monitored round the clock. At first there appeared to be a deal . between Chinese and US diplomats to allow him to be reunited with his . wife and two small children. Then Chen appealed to be allowed to spend some time in the United States. Despite the tensions, Mrs Clinton claimed yesterday that ties between the two countries were the strongest they had ever been. 'Of course, the United States continues to raise human rights because we . believe that they are essential for every country to uphold.' 'We raise specific matters of individuals and situations whenever . necessary because we cannot ignore our areas of difference in the . comprehensive relationship that we are building,' Clinton said. The Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement on its website that Chen would be allowed to study overseas 'in accordance with laws of relevant departments' but did not give any further details.

Talks: Before leaving Moscow for Beijing, Kofi Annan said that the main issue now is to start a dialogue . Kofi Annan, the United Nations and Arab League envoy to Syria, said today that there is not a deadline for ending the Syrian crisis, but it can't be allowed to drag on indefinitely. Mr Annan told reporters before leaving Moscow for Beijing that the main issue now is to start a dialogue, adding that it would be up to the Syrians themselves to decide if President Bashar Assad should step down. He has been in Moscow since Saturday for talks on Syria with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. 'It may in the end come to that, but it's not up to me, it's up to the Syrians,' said Mr Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general. 'Our effort is to help the Syrians come to the table and find the way out of all of this.' Mr Annan added that he had discussed a possible U.N. observer mission in Syria with Damascus. 'As part of the discussions we are having with the Syrian authorities, it's not excluded that a U.N. observer force may go in to ensure that the parties honor and respect the commitments that they are going to make,' Mr Annan said. Mission: Mr Annan spoke after talks with Mr Medvedev, who promised Moscow's full support for his mission. Mr Medvedev said the mission 'may be the last chance for Syria to avoid a protracted bloody civil war' Turkey, once one of Syria's closest allies, closed its embassy in Damascus today, citing deteriorating security conditions and putting pressure on the increasingly isolated government of President Bashar al-Assad. It made the announcement as leading Syrian dissidents gathered in Turkey in an attempt to bridge divisions within the opposition ahead of Sunday's meeting of foreign governments in Istanbul. A Turkish official said the embassy's closure in neighbouring Syria was a diplomatic message to Assad's government, which has so far ignored Ankara's appeals. Last year Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan urged Assad, his one-time ally, to step down in order to end more than a year of fighting between Assad forces and opponents of his rule. Turkey provides sanctuary to over 17,000 Syrians fleeing the violence, shelters soldiers from the rebel Free Syrian Army and allows the opposition to meet regularly in Istanbul. 'We hope that they would agree to cessation of hostilities very shortly, and if that happens we will have to be on the ground to monitor and ensure that all sides are respecting the agreement.' Mr Annan spoke after talks with Medvedev, who promised Moscow's full support for his mission. Medvedev said the mission 'may be the last chance for Syria to avoid a protracted bloody civil war.' Russia - along with China - has twice shielded Assad from U.N. sanctions over his crackdown on a yearlong uprising, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed. But Moscow has strongly backed Mr Annan's mission and has grown increasingly impatient with the Syrian ruler, with the Russian foreign minister pointedly criticizing Assad for being too slow with reforms. Mr Annan said today that his message to the Syrian government was that they can't resist changes and that the bloodshed 'can't be allowed to drag on idefinitely.' 'I told the parties on the ground: they can't resist the transformational winds that are blowing,' he said. 'They have to accept that reforms have to come, change has to come, and that is the only way to deal with the situation.' He added that it would be unrealistic to set any deadlines. 'It's not practical to put out timetables and timelines when you haven't got an agreement from the parties, and this is what we are working on as speedily as we can,' he said.","'It's not up to me, it's up to the Syrians,' said the United Nations and Arab League envoy to Syria .

This is the house that compassion is building - a sanctuary for an Mely, the orangutan, who has endured year of abuse until her rescue in 2009. After her plight was made public, thousands of pounds were donated by Mail readers to help the stricken animal. One animal lover even donated a massive £500,000 gift which ensured that Mely will never again know want, fear or suffering. The anonymous donor sent the money to British wildlife charity International Animal Rescue earlier this year after we highlighted her plight in the jungles of far off Borneo. Now the rythmm of the jungle rocks to . a new beat - digging, hammering, sawing and planing as the wooden home . that will protect her and her pals is finished. Mely was snatched . from her mother 16 years ago, shackled in chains, tethered on to a tiny . verandah as a pet. She had endured seeing her mother shot and her carcass left to rot by a fisherman who wanted to keep her as a trophy pet. Traumatised and alone, the special bonding that creatures like her need was denied her. Instead she was an outcast, fed on raw noodles and chilli powder which left her undernourished and unhealthy. In the wild a diet rich in fruit and . fibres would have grown limbs that would have propelled her Tarzan-like . through the canopy of rainforest trees that form her natural habitat. As . it was her arms and legs could barely support her when IAR officials . were greenlighted by the Indonesian government to rescue her in 2009. New pad: This is the house that the compassion is building - a sanctuary for Mely, an orangutan rescued by the generosity of Daily Mail readers who now will live in comfort with her pals . Safety: Eventually Mely, who was snatched from her mother 16 days ago and kept as a pet, will be able to spend her days playing in safety in her new home . Mail readers responded magnificently to her plight, sending in donations of more than £8,000 in increasingly hard times as the economic downturn bit hard in all households. The money was used on transport - boat, plane and lorry - to get Mely from her captivity to her new home. Help finally came for Mely on Friday 22 October 2010 when the IAR rescue team swung into action. Armed . with the official licence to confiscate her and accompanied by members . of the local police department who are required to be in attendance . whenever a captive orangutan is seized, she was free at last. Resting: Mely sleeps soundly in her hammock at the Internatinonal Animal Rescue centre in Ketapang Borneo. When she was rescued Mely was lightly sedated so that the cruel padlock and chain from her neck could be removed . New beginnings: Monkey World Ape . Rescue Centre in Dorset advised on the construction work for the 60 . acre enclosure that will house Mely and some of her new found friends at . Ketapang . Caring: 'Mely had never seen another orangutan since she lost her mother, so it took some time and patience to get her through this stage of her rehabilitation,' said the IAR . Karmele Llano Sanchez, Veterinary Director of IAR in Indonesia, said: 'Having waited months for the go ahead to rescue her we received the call telling us that it was all systems go. There was very little time to plan or prepare. We knew Mely's owner had been trying to sell her and we were terrified of arriving to find that she had vanished – along with the chance to save her. Thankfully she was still there and her owner handed her over without argument. 'When the rescue team arrived it was clear that Mely was bewildered and frightened by all the upheaval. No one could find the key to unlock the heavy padlock around her neck and so she was led into the transport crate still wearing the chain. It was eventually removed hours later at IAR's rescue centre in Ketapang, West Kalimantan.' You look like me: Mely (right) meets Nicky another orphaned orangutan - it was is the first time Mely has met another orangutan since her mother shot dead 15 years ago .

Then she travelled by road for a further four hours to Pontianak where, after her documentation had been thoroughly checked and approved by aiport officials, she was flown by plane to Ketapang. A final short truck-ride brought her to IAR's rescue and rehabilitation centre where the rest of the team was waiting to greet her and settle her in to her quarantine quarters. On arrival at the centre, Mely was lightly sedated so that the cruel padlock and chain from her neck could be removed and  a swift medical examination was carried out without upsetting her. In due course blood tests and X-rays established that she was not suffering any serious ailments or diseases. 'Mely had never seen another orangutan since she lost her mother, so it took some time and patience to get her through this stage of her rehabilitation,' said the IAR. Another £100,000 is still needed to complete the jungle home for Mely and her pals - IAR hopes that donations will spike when news of her progress spreads. She has been undergoing months of intensive feeding up on mangoes, figs, lychees and eggs followed. As she recuperated she made friends with a fellow orangutan called Nicky, also rescued after a lifetime as a pet. IAR officials could barely hold back their tears when they saw the duo embrace for the first time, happy enough in the company of humans - the source of all their miseries - to display natural behaviour for the first time in their tragic lives. Happy: For Mely, the nightmare is . over - soon she will be romping on rope bridges, relaxing on tree-top . high platforms and snoozing in hammocks in a safety zone where no-one . can ever abuse her again . Now the home that will be Mely's until the day she dies is taking shape and - extra funds permitting - will be ready for her to move into later this year or early next. Monkey World Ape Rescue Centre in Dorset advised on the construction work for the 60 acre enclosure that will house Mely and some of her new found friends at Ketapang. In 1900, there were more than 315,000 orangutans in the wild, but today there are fewer than 50,000. Chained up: Mely was fed on raw noodles and chilli powder which left her undernourished and unhealthy - her arms and legs could barely support her when International Animal Rescue officials rescued her in 2009 . Desperate: Her rescuer said 'No one could find the key to unlock the heavy padlock around her neck and so she was led into the transport crate still wearing the chain. It was eventually removed hours later.' Their numbers have plummeted because their rainforest home is being destroyed so trees can be planted as part of the lucrative palm oil industry. But for Mely, at least, the nightmare is over. Soon she will be romping on rope bridges, relaxing on tree-top high platforms and snoozing in hammocks in a safety zone where no-one can ever abuse her again. A spokeswoman for IAR said; 'What a wonderful gesture for a Daily Mail reader to make.  Mely clearly touched the hearts of all.  Much more work does need to be done to help these beautiful creatures, but for Mely the future is looking bright indeed.'","Mely was snatched .

Style icon: Alexa Chung attends a Mulberry party in New York, clutching her signature bag by the luxury brand . Sometimes it seems no celebrity outfit would be complete without a Mulberry bag. And the luxury British brand is reaping the rewards of its A-list endorsement, after it posted a 54 per cent surge in profits. Mulberry has benefited from its association with fashion icon Alexa Chung and, more recently, American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey. The Alexa bag has become a modern classic, with the standard version selling out from Beijing to New York despite a price tag of £785, while an Oak Ostrich version was listed at £3,750. The firm’s £795 Del Rey bag, which was launched in the spring,  has also been hugely successful. Sienna Miller carried the bag to actor Robert Pattinson’s birthday party in London last month, while Oscar-nominated actress Jennifer Lawrence is also a fan. Such is the allure of the Mulberry name that some see its luxury bags as an investment that will maintain and even increase in value – much like gold. Mulberry told the City yesterday it had been helped by strong trading in Asian markets and a 30 per cent rise in sales from 45 stores and concessions in the UK. The firm has recently announced plans to open a second factory in Somerset, creating 300 jobs and doubling its UK capacity. The £7.5million project in Bridgwater, which is being supported by the Regional Growth Fund, comes less than a year after it completed the extension of its existing factory at Chilcompton, Somerset, creating 60 jobs. But the company admitted that sales growth has slowed in recent weeks, an announcement that was seized on by City analysts. As a result, shares in the business, which was founded by Roger Saul and his mother Joan in 1971, slumped by around 25 per cent in early trading. The company itself is confident of growing to become a powerful global brand and recently appointed Frenchman Bruno Guillon, former managing director of luxury brand Hermes, as chief executive. Chairman Godfrey Davis said: ‘While . the current economic conditions make the short term trading outlook more . challenging in some markets, we remain confident about Mulberry's . long-term future.’ The Mulberry shop in Floral Street, London: The . company has benefitted from a 30 per cent rise in sales from 45 stores . and concessions in the UK . Matthew McEachran, an analyst at Singer Capital Markets, said despite the fall-back in growth in sales and the fact profits were slightly below expectations, the prospects for the group remain ‘exciting’. The group plans to open between 15 and 20 international stores this year, including in South Korea, San Francisco, Singapore, Japan and Shanghai. Jaana Jatyri, chief executive of fashion forecaster Trendstop.com, said: ‘More than even Burberry, perhaps, Mulberry is a brand that has benefited from the growing demand in Asia. ‘Some are even buying Mulberry hand-crafted handbags as an investment, seeing them as a safe haven similar to gold.’","UK-made bags are a hit among fashionistas worldwide .

A Sainsbury's campaign offering to ‘Feed your family for £50 a week’ has been banned for misleading shoppers. The high-profile adverts claimed a family of four would be able to eat three healthy meals a day on a recession-busting budget. But customers complained that the meal plans did not provide sufficient calories, meaning additional food would have to be bought. Under fire: The supermarket giant has been told it was in breach of rules with its 'misleading' advertisements . They said the weekly cost did not include a number of ‘store cupboard’ ingredients that had to be purchased separately. They were also concerned that a warning that the weekly plans were not suitable for children under four was buried in the terms and conditions. The Advertising Standards Authority has now ruled that the supermarket was in breach of rules including those covering misleading advertising, substantiation and prices. The watchdog said that the TV, press and online adverts must not be used again in their current form. The decision is an embarrassment for Sainsbury’s at a time when it is fighting to erode Tesco’s dominance as the country’s number one supermarket. An ASA spokesman said: ‘Because the ads claimed that readers could meet all their family food needs for a week for  £50, when that was not the case, we concluded that Sainsbury’s had over-claimed and that the ads were misleading on this point. ‘The published meal plans also listed store cupboard ingredients which were not included in the headline price of £50, such as olive oil, dried mixed herbs, fresh garlic, mustard, tomato puree, stock cubes and plain flour. ‘We understood that a significant number of consumers would have to buy ingredients in addition to those listed on the meal plans, bringing the cost above £50. ‘Because we considered that the ads implied the advertised meals plans were suitable for children under four years of age when that was not the case, and because we understood that customers with children under four would therefore have to alter the meal plans and buy additional food for that age group, we concluded that the ad was misleading.’ The campaign ran throughout May and June last year and followed the company’s Jamie Oliver-led ‘Feed your family for a fiver’ adverts, which started in 2008. Adverts included pictures of three meals with the words: ‘28 breakfasts, 28 lunches, 28 dinners, 1 happy family.’ Shoppers were urged to ‘follow our meal plan, three meals a day, seven days a week’. Celebrity endorsement: Chef Jamie Oliver has backed a previous Sainsbury's campaign challenging shoppers to feed their family for fiver . But food experts voiced concerns about . the plans, which worked out at 60p per meal per person. The average . prison meal costs £2.10. Toast and sandwiches featured heavily, including three breakfasts of toast and jam in one weekly plan. They . said the meals provided only around 1,600 calories a day. Other . warnings included a lack of fruit and the poor nutritional balance of . some meals. Defending the campaign yesterday, Sainsbury’s said the meals were not intended to provide all the calories needed every day and were supposed to be supplemented by drinks and snacks. But nutritionist Helen Money branded the meal plans irresponsible. ‘If you didn’t read the terms and conditions you would end up losing weight, which can have a dangerous impact on your health if you’re healthy or underweight,’ she said. ‘It also increases the risk from some underlying health conditions. Men are meant to have around 2,500 calories, so it’s 1,000 calories less than they should be having, which is equivalent to losing 2lb a week. That is at the top end of weight loss recommendations.’ Sainsbury’s said it had developed the meals with the British Nutrition Foundation and there had been only six complaints out of four million customers who became involved with the initiative. It declined to say whether it would run the campaign again, although the meal plans were still available online yesterday. A spokesman added: ‘We are surprised and disappointed that the ASA has come to this judgment as it does not reflect the feedback we have had from our customers. ‘Our “Feed your family for £50” campaign has been very popular and resonated with customers who clearly understood that a small handful of ingredients in the meals plans would have come from their store cupboards. ‘We worked closely with independent experts and still believe that our meal plans provide nutritious and tasty family meals in a cost-effective way.’","Customers claimed supermarket's claim did not provide sufficient calories .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . UPDATED: . 08:29 EST, 2 December 2011 . Hundreds of NHS patients blighted by faulty hip replacements are embroiled in a landmark legal battle an investigation has revealed. According to a report many have been left immobile after they were fitted with false joints made by DePuy - a medical device company owned by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson. Lawyer Lisa Lunt is now representing 300 clients as they seek compensation payments, ranging from £25,000 to £1million. Angry: 57-year-old Stephen Ellis, reported that black liquid drained from his hip after the metal joint, fitted over two years ago, started to poison his bones and muscles . One patient, 57-year-old Stephen Ellis, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, reported that black liquid drained from his hip after the metal joint started to poison his bones and muscles. The Liverpudlian is among thousands of patients . who have had to return to hospital for a second hip replacement, as a result of the defective parts. A hip replacement is a surgical procedure where hip joints, damaged by injury or disease, are replaced with an artificial version. Mr Ellis, who was originally treated in 2009, told the BBC: 'Not long after the operation I had a sharp pain when I lifted my left leg. Mr Ellis had a further operation to correct the damage in August but he claims he still needs crutches . 'After two years the pain was so severe I couldn't sit down. When they drained the fluid from the joint . it was black like dirt. 'The surgeon was amazed and said to me on a scale . of 1-10 the damage was 10.' The ASR hip implant is made of metal . instead of traditional materials such as ceramic or plastic and was hailed as a medical breakthrough. Patient will receive either a general anaesthetic (where they are put to sleep) or a spinal (epidural) anaesthetic plus sedation . The surgeon will then remove the existing hip joint completely . The upper part of the femur (thigh bone) is removed and the natural socket for the head of the femur is hollowed out . A plastic or ceramic socket is fitted into the hollow in the pelvis . A short, angled metal shaft with a smooth ball on its upper end (to fit into the socket) is placed into the hollow of the thigh bone . The plastic cup and the artificial bone head may be pressed into place or fixed with acrylic cement . Metal-on-metal (MoM) hip resurfacing is carried out in a similar way - the main difference is that much less of the bone is removed as only the joint surfaces are replaced with metal inserts . SOURCE: NHS . But many of the metal fittings eroded faster . than expected and released microscopic metals which could have led to poisoning in the bone and muscle. Mr Ellis added: 'I feel like an old man in his eighties. I feel robbed of my life. 'I still can't lie on my left side and can't sleep well and now have a life of continual discomfort.' Mr Ellis had a further operation to correct the damage in August but he claims he has been left with a limp and still needs crutches. However not all joints have failed and DePuy has denied liability for any alleged faults. In a statement the company said: 'Clinical studies and monitoring show the benefits of . metal-on-metal technology often outweigh the risks for many patients.' This week a new report in the . British Medical Journal claimed that modern, all-metal hip implants . appear no more effective than traditional implants - and could be less . safe. Researchers claimed that despite metal-on-metal implants being supposedly more durable than earlier metal-on-polyethylene implants over . the past few years, metal implants have failed at a greater . rate. Lead researcher Dr Art Sedrakyan, of Cornell University, New York City said the analysis . indicates patients implanted with the metal devices are twice at . risk of needing a repeat operation years later. Lawyer Lisa Lunt  added: 'It's had a terrible price on my clients psychologically. ""It's broken up relationships and some clients have said they would consider taking their own life because of the pain.' At least 50,000 hip replacements are carried out each year in Britain, usually on adults aged over 65.

Six-year-olds are being asked to read the words to test their literacy levels in tests carried out this summer . A Government initiative to test school literacy levels will see more than 500,000 six-year-olds asked to read ‘words’ such as jound, terg, fape and snemp. During the summer term, teachers will sit down individually with every Year 1 child and ask them to read the so-called ‘pseudo-words’ as a way of gauging reading levels. Officials preparing this year’s test are having to ensure that none of the non-words is offensive or rude in the mother tongue of pupils whose first language is not English. The Government is pushing ahead with using the pseudo-words in the tests despite the results of a public consultation in which two-thirds of people said they should not be included. The non-words will have a picture of an imaginary creature next to them as a signal that the word is made up and could be the name of the pretend creature. Each child will have to read  a total of 40 words; 20 real ones such as week, chill, grit and start as well as 20 non-words such as spron, stroft and ulf. The idea is that the test will establish how well schools are teaching phonics, a system in which children learn the sounds that groups of letters make rather than just remembering what different words look like. The results will be fed back to the Department for Education, which will use them to compare schools and analyse whether it helps to improve reading. Professor Dominic Wyse of the Institute of Education said: ‘Clearly, non-words don’t have any meaning. Understanding meaning is the essence of reading so we must ask if this test really assesses reading. ‘Attention to other aspects of reading such as enjoyment and comprehension are likely to be restricted because of the focus on phonics.’ The Government is taking action after it was revealed last year that one child in six fails to reach the required reading level before going to secondary school.",Officials ensuring none of them are offensive in mother tongues of pupils whose first language is not English .

Theirs has been a famously tricky relationship, involving an acrimonious divorce, a hugely successful fashion brand and an allegedly similar retail venture. Now, Chris Burch, 58, has been forced to step down from his role on the board of Tory Burch's company, after allegations that his C Wonder brand was too similar to the double-T-emblemed line. According to the New York Post, an insider claims that the venture capitalist-turned retail guru is no longer co-chair of his 45-year-old ex-wife's business. It's over: Chris and Tory Burch's marriage ended in 2006. The couple have now parted business ways and no longer work together on the board of Tory Burch . The source said that 'this reflects . how her company has been run since its inception. Chris never had an . office or was involved in the day-to-day running of Tory Burch. While . Chris remains a shareholder and a board member at Tory Burch, Barclays . Capital remains engaged to sell his shares.' The couple are now said to be working . together to 'avoid more brand confusion', according to the source, and . involving the courts is not an aim of the successful businesswoman. 'She is asking him to change his . concept, which includes C. Wonder’s product, the design and the . boutique. It remains Tory’s intent not to litigate — she is hopeful . he’ll agree to change his concept. Litigation would be the very last . resort.' The Post reports that Ms Burch, 45, who . recently bought and redecorated a Hamptons mansion, is supportive of her . ex's career 'but she wants him to do something unique and original, not . to knock off her products.' Copycat? The elaborate lettering of Chris Burch's initials looks almost identical in style, many believe, to the now famous mirror image T's of his ex-wife's brand . The move follows a dispute over brand similarities between Tory Burch and C Wonder. Compounding the proximity of the stores in SoHo, some believe the logo and concepts were a also little too close for comfort. Mr Burch's new . retail concept, C Wonder, has been under the careful scrutiny of friends of Ms Burch, . who said that he clearly copied many features of his ex-wife's . design aesthetic including the logo. The venture capitalist has chosen an emblem that some see . as being almost identical to his ex-wife's now . famous mirror image T's. A friend of Ms Burch told New York Magazine in February: 'Tory knows it, and everyone knows it... 'There’s the snap bracelets. The wallets. The . buttons...' This is not the first time Mr Burch has experimented with cheaper versions of the preppy, colourful style . that Ms Burch is known for. Is it any wonder? Chris Burch's label has been compared with his ex-wife's but many say he knows enough about the business to have created his own aesthetic . Burch style? Tory Burch's store showcases the preppy, colourful style that some say has been emulated by her ex-husband . When Mr Burch's then wife decided to launch her own line in 2004, he developed a more affordable offshoot as a safety net. It was never manufactured due to the . success of the Tory Burch label but those close to the immaculate blonde . designer see C. Wonder as an obvious second attempt to compete with her . brand. A fellow board member had told the magazine: 'There is . some apparent customer confusion between the two brands. And that’s not . good for anybody.' Others like PR guru Kelly Cutrone, who is . working with Mr Burch on a collection, argued that a man . who has helped launch nearly 50 brands is fashion savvy enough to take . credit for his own look.

Does Lilly Pulitzer . start calling Tory and saying, ""Hey, you’re doing a modernized version . of what I used to do, please stop""?

The single mum-of-three had agreed to adopt Caroline Atkin's three boys and two girls who had been orphaned by the loss of both their parents within six months of each other. Caroline was given 12 months to live when she was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour in April 2009. Adopted family: Julie Jones with her best friend Caroline Atkin's . children, from left, Michael, 12 , Emma, 8, Chantelle, 6, James, 10 . and Kieran, 11 . Tragically, her husband, David, 44, died suddenly from a brain haemorrhage just nine months later in January 2010. When an increasingly ill Caroline, 45, was left worrying about what would happen to her children when she too passed away, she asked Julie if she would care for her children - an agreement they dubbed their 'Plan B'. Caroline passed away a few months later in June, and Julie kept to her word and took all five children into her home - putting the three boys in a tent in the garden until she could get her house re-organised and turning her dining room into an extra bedroom. Julie, 46, is now mum to her own children Christian, 14, Peter, 18, and Adam, 20, as well as Michael 12, Keiran, 11, James, 10, Emma, 8 and Chantelle, 6 - and she still works full time. The remarkable family are also in close contact with Caroline and David's eldest son Tim, 17, who lives with relatives in Lincolnshire. Julie's describes her incredible undertaking as 'natural and ordinary'. She said: 'Caroline and I met on the first day of secondary school, I was her chief bridesmaid and godmother to most of her kids. 'She put in her will that she wanted me to become legal guardian to the kids so no one could take them away. 'I got a phone call to tell me Caroline had been rushed to hospital, but by the time I arrived she had passed away. 'It was the worst day of my life. Telling the children was the hardest thing. Caroline Atkin (seated, left) shortly before she died in June 2010, with five of her six children and her best friend Julie Jones (standing) 'I told the little ones when I picked them up from school that afternoon - I'll never forget it. 'They asked me if I would take them to the park - so we went to the park. We've been together ever since.' She added: 'When they arrived they were like little soldiers all lined up. My friends and family turned up with sheets.' Brave Julie has managed to make her unique family work, with little financial backing from social services. The heroic mum, of Huntingdon Cambridgeshire, was disappointed when she contacted her local council for financial support only to be told to sell her family home. Officials suggested she would be better off by moving into council accommodation and claiming benefits, but Julie refused. Julie said: 'That's not something I would ever want to do. We have a comfortable home we just need a bit of help.The only thing I wish for is a bit of help.' Julie also had a grant application for an extension to make her home more suitable turned down by the council. Her dining room has been turned into a bedroom for her own sons, the eldest now lives away at university. Julie said: 'I love the children like they were my own and would never have seen them end up in care. 'The children are adorable we talk about their mummy and daddy a lot, we have the support of family and friends and I have a lovely job at RAF Brampton.' And she insisted: 'What I am doing is something very natural and ordinary. 'I'm there when they need a mummy, when they need love and care. And I know Caroline would have done exactly the same for me.'",Julie Jones - who already had three sons of her own - had been best friends with Caroline Atkin since they started secondary school .

The television presenter, 55, who is a guest anchor on the ABC show this week while Robin Roberts is on vacation, tweeted an Instagram photo of herself during her journey into the studio at around 6am. With her face bare of make-up and her hair still damp from the shower, she was barely recognisable from the glossy, groomed figure we are more familiar with. Unrecognisable: Katie Couric tweeted an Instagram photo of herself from her car en route to the GMA studios this morning. Clearly bleary-eyed from the early start, she was wearing sunglasses - despite the still-dark sky . Evidently a little bleary-eyed from the early-morning wake-up call, she told her Twitter followers: 'Not used to waking up this early anymore! Where's the coffee?!' Ms Couric was even sporting sunglasses - despite the fact that it was still dark outside. Referencing the popular song by Corey Hart, she accompanied the picture with the words: 'I wear sunglasses at night (and early in the am)' Excited: She was looking rather more like herself by 7.30am when she tweeted her second photo, a behind-the-scenes glimpse of a make-up artist giving a final dusting of face powder before the show went live . This didn't seem to hamper her mood. From the wide grin in the photo to her commentary on the pre-show prep, Ms Couric's enthusiasm was infectious. 'Prepping with producers...loving the @GMA energy! Busy morning!' she wrote. She was looking rather more like herself by 7.30am when she tweeted her second photo, a behind-the-scenes glimpse of a make-up artist giving a final dusting of face powder before the show went live. 'Final touches!' she tweeted. Polished: Ms Couric on air with co-host George Stephanopoulos. She is covering this week for Robin Roberts . According to TMZ, not everybody at GMA was pleased about Ms Couric's guest role. The website has claimed that Ms Roberts, who is well-liked among her colleagues, was 'unhappy' about the casting. It was called a 'slap in the face' and one source said: 'They should have put Katie on when George was on vacation.' Ms Couric was last seen on breakfast television almost six years ago on NBC's Today show. She had been a co-anchor on the show for 15 years. She had said goodbye to the show to become the first female anchor for CBS Evening News. She is now a special correspondent for ABC news, contributing to a number of their programs. She is set to launch Katie, her own Disney-ABC daytime talk show, on September 10. Delighted: Despite the fact her last breakfast television appearance was almost six years ago, the presenter drew a crowd of early morning fans all keen to witness her return . Despite the early start, Ms Couric managed to bring her sense of humour to the set as she co-hosted with George Stephanopoulos. She featured in a comical prerecorded video when the show started, pretending to run around in her pajamas as she prepared for the day. Let the banter begin: Matt Lauer launched a jibe at Sarah Palin in a phone interview to promote her stint as co-anchor tomorrow . Today's GMA show featured several segments about the unidentified Mega Millions lottery winners as well coverage of the Pakistani beauty queen who has been charged with an alleged mortgage scam. In a strategic counter-programming move, the Today show tomorrow will be co-hosted by Sarah Palin. Offering a taster of the banter viewers can expect when she joins the NBC morning show, Matt Lauer interviewed Mrs Palin live via telephone today. He asked: 'What are you doing to prepare? Are you reading some newspapers?' The acerbic question was of course a play on the one posed by Katie Couric during a CBS interview that Mrs Palin, then a GOP VP candidate, was unable to answer. Again, she failed to answer directly with a list of publications, instead responding with: 'Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho... Great! That’s a fine how do you do? That’s a great start. Here we go.' When asked how she was feeling ahead of her stint as co-anchor, Mrs Palin replied: 'How nervous you should all be, perhaps.' She also praised the network's 'boldness' in allowing her to host the show, adding: 'I really look forward to this and you know I appreciate NBC’s boldness in having me on.'","The former Today anchor is a guest host on GMA this week while Robin Roberts is on vacation .

"By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 18:56 EST, 30 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:15 EST, 1 May 2012 . Thora Hird was more than just a national treasure — she was one of the British crown jewels, a walloping great diamond on a firmly knotted headscarf. When she died in 2003, aged 91, one obituary summed her up perfectly as a cross between the Queen Mum and a Donald McGill saucy seaside postcard. But she was also a superb character actress and, for many, as host of Praise Be!, the real face of Sunday worship. Treasure: Thora Hird's 90-year career was not enough for English Heritage . So a decision by English Heritage to deny her the honour of a blue plaque isn’t just stuffy and pompous — it’s downright incomprehensible. When the advisory panel, which includes Stephen Fry, former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion and former Arts Council chairman Sir Christopher Frayling, ruled that Dame Thora’s contribution to theatre might be forgotten in 20 years or less, they betrayed their total ignorance of a career that stretched across an incredible nine decades. She was eight weeks old when she made her first stage appearance in her mother’s  arms. ‘It was the first and only job  I ever got through influence,’ she said. (Her father James ran the Royalty Theatre in Morecambe.) At the other end of her life, she . played a centenarian in a Talking Heads play by Alan Bennett, called . Waiting For The Telegram. Talk about a lifetime devoted to theatre: Dame . Thora packed enough into her career for two whole lifetimes. It . is baffling that English Heritage can’t  see this. It’s not, after all, . as if accolades weren’t forthcoming during her lifetime. Thora was made . a dame in 1993, back when the honour was reserved for theatre . heavyweights such as Edith Evans and Sybil Thorndike. Staying power: Thora Hird and actor Freddie Frinton at the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition at Olympia in 1965 . It helped, of course, that she played the Queen’s favourite character in the Royal Family’s favourite TV show, Last Of The Summer Wine. Thora was Edie Pegden, the hectoring, house-proud president of the local ladies’ coffee morning. Thora’s artful performance delighted in Edie’s snobbish side — when there was company, her voice would lose its coarse edge and turn quite snooty. Hugely amused, writer Roy Clarke was . inspired to base a whole sitcom on  the trait — and Hyacinth Bucket in . Keeping Up Appearances was born. Edie’s . character was inspired by the socially anxious, lower-middle-class . women whom Thora had observed during her early years working behind the . till at the  Co-op in Morecambe. She spent ten years as a cashier, working by day, acting in the evening and learning lines deep into the night. Potential: This publicity picture of 'actress Miss Thora Hird' was issued in November 1953 . She never lost her sense of those humble roots. ‘I scrubbed my mother’s doorstep when I was a young woman,’ she liked to tell reporters. ‘Now go and fetch me mink!’ She married James Scott, a drummer in . the theatre orchestra, in 1937, after a four-year courtship, and their . only child, a daughter called Janette, was born a year later. Thora always claimed that, because there were no forceps handy, the midwife used a pair of fish knives. In . later life, her son-in-law was the crooner Mel Torme, and she visited . her daughter’s family in Beverly Hills at least two dozen times. She was . never tempted to make a home in California, though. ‘There’s no corner shop, love,’ she would say. Surely the English Heritage committee cannot be prejudiced against her Lancashire accent and working-class humour? Legends: Thora Hird in June 1970 with comedian Tommy Cooper who collapsed on stage during a live televised show in 1984 and soon after died . It’s true that Thora was salt-of-the-earth, while recent blue plaques  have been awarded to the sprinkling-of-chopped-tarragon- and-a grated-truffle type: Sir Terence Rattigan, playwright of the drawing room, for example, or the aristocratic Indian poet Rabindrinath Tagore. Her rejection has provoked outrage among fans. Maureen Lipman, herself a sitcom actress with strong claims for national treasuredom, called the decision ‘imbecilic snobbery’. Tory MP David Morris immediately announced he would table an Early Day Motion in the Commons to force the committee to reconsider. But it seems unlikely to succeed: there’s a rule applications cannot be reviewed for at least ten years. The most puzzling aspect is that Dame Thora’s case met the criteria of English Hidebound (sorry, Heritage). The rules state that to be considered blue-plaque-worthy, a person has to have been dead for 20 years or the centenary of their birth has been passed. The centenary of her birth was reached last year, on May 28: she would be 101 this month. She had lived and worked in London, moving there when the musical hall star George Formby asked her to audition for a film with him at Ealing Studios, during the Blitz in 1941. She didn’t get the part, but the test led to a 1942 film called The Black Sheep Of Whitehall, opposite comedian Will Hay. Incidentally, Hay has got a blue plaque, so has the film’s producer, Michael Balcon. And she died at Brinsworth House, a retirement home for actors in South-West London. Hird is so much a part of her adopted city that she is one of the few actors to have inspired a piece of Cockney rhyming slang. Popular: Thora Hird pictured in 1987 when she was starring in long running British sitcome Last of the Summer Wine which went for 31 series . University students who scrape through their exams are said to get a Thora Hird — or third, as in third-class degree. If that seems disrespectful, you should hear the stories Thora liked to tell about herself. Alan Bennett noted one of her favourites in his diary — she claimed that when she was a girl growing up next-door to the theatre in Morecambe, an alley ran along the back where the seaside town’s only lady of the night, Miss Nellie Hodge, would take her clients. One night, Thora heard a man’s complaining voice: ‘Ee Nellie, I wish you’d stop nodding your head.’ ‘I can’t help it,’ Nellie replied. ‘You’ve gone and got tangled in me  scarf.’ It’s not the sort of tale Thora would have told on Praise Be! — the Sunday evening collection of viewers’ favourite hymns she hosted, which ran for 17 years on  BBC1 in the teatime ‘God slot’.  Like former Goon Show entertainer Harry Secombe who presented Songs Of Praise, she became an unofficial symbol of the Church of England. Varied: Thora Hird also appeared in the TV show In Loving Memory, set in an undertakers business, which ran from 1979 until 1986 . It was no stretch to imagine Thora reading her Bible at home and being comforted by familiar verses, or being moved to tears by the plain poetry of well-loved hymns. Each week, five million people tuned in. She had a wisdom in her voice that was rooted in common sense, something that audiences could recognise and cherish. It was that quality which Bennett captured in his 1988 short play, A Cream Cracker Under The Settee,  written for Thora. She played an elderly widow who had suffered a fall. Gradually, in a monologue that becomes mumbled as her life slips away, Thora revealed her fall was the consequence of climbing up on to the furniture, trying to do the dusting. It was a portrait of abandonment and loss, depicted with such heart-rending pathos that Thora’s postbag was bulging for days after the  broadcast with letters from people begging her to come and live with them. How can English Heritage fail to see how beloved this woman was? And why would they think she might be less warmly remembered in a couple of decades? A look at recently approved names on plaques provides a clue: they are largely male. So, too, is the committee: seven of the ten, including the chairman, historian Professor Sir David Cannadine, are men. Glamour: This picture taken in 1966 shows Thora Hird enjoying a night at the fashionable Dorchester Hotel in London's Park Lane . Plenty of plaques have been granted to actors in the past few years. Alastair Sim, a star of Ealing comedies, was honoured with a blue plate at his Hampstead home. Sim was a lovely, lugubrious comic, but he is hardly a household name — never the star of TV’s longest-running sitcom, for instance. To test the theory that there’s a sexist bias at English Heritage, I suggested a couple of candidates — both actresses. One was Hattie Jacques, the matron of the Carry On movies. The other was Diana Dors, the only bona fide sex-bomb of British cinema’s golden era. Both were younger than Thora. Both have been dead for more than 20 years. Both lived and worked in London. In other words, they meet  the criteria. A spokeswoman for English Heritage admitted last night that neither Hattie nor Diana had ever been considered. That’s a disgrace. But for a committee that is incompetent enough to deny an honour to the Queen’s favourite actress, it’s probably not surprising. Or as Dame Thora might have said: ‘Them’s too numb to know they are numb!’ CHRISTOPHER STEVENS compiled The Masters Of Sitcom: From Hancock To Steptoe (Michael O’Mara Books).

The man accused of stabbing his . on-again, off-again girlfriend, suffocating her and dismembering her . body told a newspaper she begged him to kill her and forced a knife he . held into her own torso. Matthew Puccio, 25, of Urbana, Ohio, is charged with murder in the death of 21-year-old Jessica Sacco. He told the Dayton Daily News from jail on Wednesday that he plans to plead guilty and deserves death. Puccio says the couple argued in . their apartment the night before her March 22 death and she asked him to . 'slash her throat, slash her wrists, do something'. Two other couples are accused of watching Puccio murder his girlfriend and then help him dispose of her remains. They had just recently moved in with them after meeting on the Internet, police said last night. Some of Jessica's body parts were . found abandoned in a bathtub at the property last Friday, the rest were . discovered 90miles away in Kentucky. Puccio stabbed Miss Sacco, placed a bag over her head and suffocated her at home on around March 22, police believe. Watching the killing and helping dispose of some of the remains were flatmates Andrew Forney, 26, and his wife Kandis Forney, 25, both of Fenton, Michigan, along with a third couple from Urbana, it is alleged. Victim: Jessica Sacco, 21, was stabbed, suffocated and dismembered at her home in Urbana, Ohio. her boyfriend said she begged him to kill her . Miss Sacco's body was found after a pedestrian alerted a police officer in a patrol car eight days later on March 30.

Chief Lingrell said the couples had known each other only a short time before the Forneys moved into the Urbana apartment about a month ago. He said it was not clear how Puccio and Miss Sacco knew the third couple - Christopher Wright, 37, and Sharon Cook, 25, also from Urbana - but all five suspects were only recently acquainted. He said: 'They're just loose friends.' Tragic: Miss Sacco's remains were not found until eight days after she was believed to have been killed . It is alleged the Forneys, Wright and . Cook were in the apartment when Miss Sacco was killed but failed to . intervene. Puccio and Andrew Forney then moved Miss Sacco's body to the . bathtub and dismembered it. Miss Sacco, who once took classes at a local college, had been in Urbana for about a year after moving there from California, while Puccio had only been in the city for a few months. Both were unemployed. Miss Sacco probably died of suffocation, Champaign County coroner Joshua Richards said. A single stab wound to her upper abdomen did not penetrate vital organs.

Drivers face new tolls under audacious plans to put Britain’s roads network in the hands of private companies. David Cameron will today say he wants to kickstart the economy by allowing firms and investment funds to compete to build, operate and maintain motorways and trunk roads. Motorists would not pay tolls to use existing roads – but firms could widen them and introduce pay-as-you-go lanes that drivers could use to beat congestion. Scroll down for video . Audacious plans: Motorists would not pay tolls to use existing roads - but firms could widen them and introduce pay-as-you-go lanes that drivers could use to beat congestion . Money-maker: The move could become the biggest sell-off since the rail privatisations of the 1990s . New roads constructed from scratch by private investors, meanwhile, could become French-style toll roads. In addition, a proportion of the £6billion a year raised through vehicle excise duty would be used by the Government to pay contractors, probably based on the number of vehicles using the route. Ministers hope that as well as getting more private sector investment into the economy, a sale of long-term leases of major roads could raise billions for the Treasury. It could become the biggest sell-off since the rail privatisations of the 1990s. But motoring groups warned last night that drivers struggling with record fuel prices could ill-afford new charges – and suggested the move could lead to national road pricing, where motorists pay for every mile they drive. Warning there is simply no longer enough money in public coffers to build more new roads, the Prime Minister will say in a speech today: ‘We now need to be more ambitious. A taxing issue: Toll booths - like this one near Sutton Coldfield - could make more of an appearance on Britain's roads if private companies are allowed to run them . Ambitious: David Cameron (left) is set to reveal the plans as George Osborne (right) seeks to jumpstart the economy and avoid a double dip recession . ‘Why is it that other infrastructure – for example water – is funded by private sector capital through privately owned, independently regulated, utilities, but roads in Britain call on the public finances for funding?’ The radical move comes as Chancellor George Osborne seeks to jumpstart the economy and avoid a double dip recession. Other moves expected in Wednesday’s Budget include: . Ministers are proposing selling long-term leases, probably lasting several decades, to firms or investment funds who want to take over the running of major routes and be guaranteed a regular income over the life of the contract by taking a slice of vehicle excise duty. Treasury sources said such a scheme would not be full-scale privatisation, since the state would retain ultimate ownership, but would still generate ‘billions’. Full-scale road pricing – where drivers are charged by the mile – has been ruled out. In a speech today, Mr Cameron will say Britain needs ‘good roads’ to boost economic growth. But he will admit: ‘The problem’s clear: we don’t have enough capacity in places of key demand. There’s nothing green about a traffic jam – and gridlock holds the economy back. ‘So here’s what we should do. Yes, move passengers and heavy goods on to rail. But also widen pinch points, add lanes to motorways by using the hard shoulder to increase capacity and dual overcrowded A-roads. 'The massive programme announced during last year’s growth review made a good start. But how do we do more, when, frankly, there isn’t enough money? 'We need to look at innovative approaches to the funding of our national roads – to increase investment to reduce congestion. Road tolling is one option – but we are only considering this for new, not existing, capacity.’ Mr Cameron will say that the Treasury and Transport Department will draw up options for ‘new ownership and financing models for the national roads system’ and report to Downing Street by the autumn. Sources made clear all options were on the table. But they said the most likely model was that of the water industry, where private firms are overseen by an industry regulator. Only motorways and major trunk roads, which make up three per cent of the country’s road network, would go into private hands. Matthew Hancock, Conservative MP for West Suffolk and former chief of staff to George Osborne, told Radio 4’s Today programme, this morning: ‘We have a chronic need to get more infrastructure in. 'This is about leveraging in investment – not about selling off roads but about getting investment in roads. If we can find new ways of doing that, I think everyone would accept, this is not only needed but valuable. 'There’s upgrades to roads going on at the moment that have waited for decades. Take the A11 to Norwich. The expected return to the economy is 20 times the cost, but it’s waited 20 years to happen. 'Given the economic returns on some of these projects which aren’t being built because of the lack of money the Government’s got, then the returns to the economy, and also the millions of people stuck in traffic, are very great from being able to get that extra investment in.' 'The benefit is that because private companies doing the work would know they’ve got an income stream coming in the future from the cars using the roads they manage, then they could go to investors, pension funds and others, and say lend us the money now, we’ll be able to improve the roads, we’ll get more people going on them, faster, because of the reducing traffic. 'And that way we can get the investment now that benefits the economy that can’t done because of the constraints on public funds.' But AA president Edmund King said: 'I'm not sure it adds up in that case. Motorists are already paying 45 billion a year in various motoring taxes, of which, in total, only something like nine billion is spent on the roads. So yes, there is money going in. The Highways Agency could be run more efficiently, but I don't really think you need a new ownership structure. ‘The Government has indicated that tolls would only apply on new capacity, but many drivers would suspect new ownership is the thin end of the wedge leading to national road pricing. Many drivers can’t afford current fuel prices, so new charges would be a toll too far.’ Labour transport spokesman Maria Eagle said the proposals risked ‘driving traffic on to local roads, increasing congestion and emissions while yet again setting back efforts to improve safety’. Mr Osborne insisted yesterday he intends to press ahead with a major shake-up of the planning system to speed up new developments, despite criticism from countryside campaigners. ‘It is deeply frustrating that the planning rules have held back economic development in Britain,’ the Chancellor said.","Prime Minister says move - which could become the biggest sell-off since the rail privatisations of the 1990s - will help kick-start the economy .

Argentine president Cristina Kirchner was left red-faced last night after it emerged the star of her controversial Falklands ad is set to miss the Olympics. Hockey player Fernando Zylberberg flew to the islands and worked out on a British war memorial ahead of the London games with the boast : ""To compete on English soil, we are training on Argentine soil."" The Argentine government ignored . international criticism to screen the ad repeatedly and use it to launch . vitriolic attacks on Britain. Scroll down for video . Controversial: President Christina Kirchner (L) is now facing having to take down the much debated ad which features field hockey player Fernando Zylberberg (R) working out on the Falklands islands' Great War Memorial . But their outspoken president was put on the back foot today/yesterday (WED) after it emerged Zylberberg has been left out of a pre-Olympics hockey tournament and will almost certainly be passed over for London. The ad starring him, condemned as 'tawdry and cowardly' by Falklands survivor Simon Weston, was last night expected to be dropped from Argentine TV screens. A source close to the ad agency behind the video admitted: ""Fernando missing the Olympics would be a bit of an embarrassment. 'He was picked because we thought he'd be a dead cert for the event. 'I suspect the ad will be quietly dropped now. 'It's difficult to see how you can make propaganda based on an Olympian training on disputed territory when it turns out he's not going to go to the Olympics.' Another added: 'Everyone involved in the project feels pretty silly at the moment. 'What was trumpeted as a kick in the teeth for Britain has turned out to be a spectacular own goal. 'There's a little-bit of wound licking going on at the moment. 'Cristina Kirchner never envisaged for one moment when she was making political capital out of the video that Fernando would be left out of the Olympics.' Zylberberg, expected to make the cut . for what would have been his third Olympics, has been virtually ruled . out after being excluded from the 18-man Argentine hockey squad taking . part in a 10-day tournament in Malaysia from May 24. His surprise exclusion comes after he received threats on social networking sites for starring in the Falklands ad. The 34-year-old failed to attend a reception at the British Embassy in Buenos Aires last night/on Tuesday night. Opening scene: After a caption reading 'Islas Malvinas', the Argentinian name for the Falkand Islands, hockey player Zylberberg is seen stepping out early in the morning for a run . Obvious landmarks: As the advert progresses, Zylberberg can be seen limbering up outside the Globe Tavern, a popular pub in Port Stanley . Passing ALL the sights: As rousing music reaches its eventual peak, Zylberberg jogs past the office of the Penguin News, which today ran quotes from Falkland Islander Ian Hansen criticising the advert . Several teammates accepted the invitation to the event, hosted by British ambassador to Argentina Shan Morgan. Zylberberg's absence from Malaysia - and his expected absence from London - has been attributed to 'sporting reasons.' But . it is bound to lead to speculation he has been dropped from the squad . because of fears his presence at the Olympics could cause his teammates . problems. One critic wrote . on Twitter after the Falklands ad was first screened: 'I'm tempted to . find out when the Argentine hockey team is due to arrive in the UK so I . can throw eggs at Zylberberg.' Another . promised to jeer him when he played and dozens called for him to put on . the first plane back to Buenos Aires when he flew in for the Games. Zylberberg . was one of three Argentine athletes who filmed the ad in secret after . flying to the Falklands under the pretext they were running a marathon. He . enraged locals and Falklands war veterans after it emerged he did . step-ups on the islands' Great War Memorial honouring British sailors . who died battling the German fleet in 1914. He . was also filmed running past the office of Falklands newspaper Penguin . News and doing arm-raises outside Port Stanley's Globe Tavern.

Twenty-year-old Donte Johnson has been sentenced to life in prison plus 40-80 years for the 2010 rape and murder of Philadelphia waitress Sabina O’Donnell. Although the jury took under four hours to find Johnson guilty of dragging Miss O'Donnell from her bike, raping her and then strangling her to death with her own bra, the defendant defiantly maintained his innocence throughout. As the sentence was passed he addressed Judge Glenn Bronson, saying: 'I understand how the family feel about their loss, but how can you clearly say I did anything? Jailed for life: Donte Johnson (left) was found guilty of raping and murdering Sabina Rose O'Donnell (right) 'I didn’t do nothing. I understand where they coming from, but I didn’t have nobody die the way they said. I didn’t have no interaction with her.' Judge Bronson replied that he had 'not one scintilla of doubt' that Johnson had committed the crimes, saying he had never felt more certain of a defendant's guilt in 31 years as a lawyer and a judge. He told Johnson his refusal to accept responsibility was 'in keeping with your history of a lack of remorse.' According to The Philadelphia Inquirer, the defendant shook his head and looked down at the table as the verdict was read, while his family burst into tears and one of his siblings fled the courtroom. Around 30 of Miss O'Donnell's relatives and friends were present, and her family gave victim impact statements to the court before the sentencing. The victim's tearful mother Rachel O'Donnell urged the judge to award the longest possible prison term. She said of her daughter: 'She was as good as a person could possibly be. Every minute that he sits there breathing oxygen is a chance she’ll never get...I don’t want anybody to ever have to run into him again.' Miss O'Donnell's aunt Heidi O'Donnell added: 'He [Johnson] has no idea what he did to all of us. He should never ever be able to walk on the same ground that Sabina did. He should never be able to look at trees and walk on the beach.' CBS Philly reported that Johnson had previously admitted the attack on Miss Johnson, saying he had only meant to steal her bicycle. He allegedly said he killed her because she screamed when he tried to take the bike. He later retracted the confession, which his lawyers claim he made only because he is mentally challenged. The prosecution in the case relied on DNA evidence and video surveillance to prove that Johnson dragged his victim to within yards of her apartment building before raping and strangling her. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said in a statement: 'My heart continues to go out to Sabina's family and friends. I hope this verdict will give them some sense of justice.' Standing outside the courtroom for the final time, Miss O'Donnell's stepfather Mark Rounds tearfully hugged his wife and the jurors. 'I'm just glad the police did their job as well as they did it and the . Assistant District Attorneys did their jobs as well and as thoroughly as . they did,' he said. According to the Philly Metro, Mr Rounds said he is not a supporter of . the death penalty, and that he was satisfied with the sentence. 'I hope the rest of society is satisfied as well,' he said. While they have now received the verdict they had yearned for, the O'Donnell family have waited almost two years to watch their daughter's killer get life. A dog walker found the young woman's body, which was naked apart from a pair of beige socks, on 2 June 2010. During the first two days of Johnson's trial, the jury heard how he grabbed his 5'3, 100lb victim when she was riding her pink and grey bike home from a night out. He grabbed her at the front of her apartment building, before dragging her 120ft to the rear of her home, where he raped and then killed her. Assistant District Attorney Richard Sax told the court that O'Donnell was: 'Tiny, small, petite but so vulnerable. Perfect prey.' He said Johnson's stalking of her on a bicycle, which was captured on CCTV to be played later on in the trial, happened because: 'He knew he could dominate, overwhelm and control her.' He claimed Johnson left his DNA 'all over her, inside of her' and said 'he destroyed her' during the attack. Defence attorney Lee Mandell rejected the claims, arguing that even DNA experts were capable of making mistakes. A forensic psychologist, Gerald Cooke, then testified that Johnson had an IQ of just 73, and had most likely been born with brain damage. He said he acted like an 11 or 12-year-old and had smoked marijuana and drunk alcohol for many years. Dog walker Christina Sirochman said the victim was clad only in her socks when she found her dumped body on June 2, 2010. Ms Sirochman told a jury the victim had a swarm of flies around her mouth, but that she touched her to see if she was alive. 'It was just like touching a piece of glass,' she said. 'That was somebody's child and I didn't want her to be alone.' Other witnesses said they found a man's dirty t-shirt and Miss O'Donnell's purse in the hours after the murder. Assistant Medical Examiner Edwin Lieberman, who performed the autopsy, said the ligature which ended Miss O'Donnell's life was 'one of the tightest' he had seen. He added that it would have taken 30 seconds for the victim to fall unconscious, and another three to five minutes of 'continuous pressure to the neck' to kill her.","Defiant to the last, Johnson asked judge, 'How can you clearly say I did anything?'

More than 100 City bankers today won . their High Court battle for £42million in unpaid bonuses from the . German banking giant Commerzbank AG. They had accused the bank of broken promises over their share of a . guaranteed bonus pool announced by Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd (DKL) in August 2008. The case comes at a time of continuing political and public anger at fat cat bank bonuses. But Mr Justice Owen said while the . subject of such bonuses was a matter of public interest, these . claims depended on a contractual clause and did not . involve the wider concerns in the banking industry today. More than 100 London investment bankers today won their High Court battle for £42m in unpaid bonuses from Commerzbank . The individual claims brought by 104 former DKL employees against the company and its new owner - which bought it in 2009 - ranged from £12,000 to £1.6milion. In January, Andrew Hochhauser QC told Mr Justice Owen the bonuses should have been paid for the year ending December 31, 2008, from a guaranteed minimum bonus pool of £320million because of 'binding and enforceable contractual promises' made between August and December 2008. They were to be allocated to front- and middle-office employees in the usual way, taking into account individual performance, and paid in full in cash in January 2009. 'Put briefly, those promises have not been honoured and that is why we are here today,' he said. 'Although the defendants accept that the statements which we rely upon were made, they deny that they amounted to contractual obligations.' Mr Hochhauser said the pool was created in August 2008 in order to retain staff in the face of a mass exodus, and was formally communicated to them by Dr Stefan Jentzsch, then chief executive of Dresdner Kleinwort Investment Bank. Martin Blessing, CEO of Commerzbank, said: 'If the court rules that it was contractually binding, of course I will accept it and pay' Dr Jentzsch said the pool would remain 'no matter what', irrespective of financial performance. Mr Hochhauser said the promises made by . Dr Jentzsch were aimed at stabilising the investment banking division . and had that effect - all of the claimant bankers did stay and continued . to work hard. But, having allocated discretionary bonuses from the pool in December . 2008, the bank subsequently decided to 'move the goalposts' and . introduce a material adverse change (MAC) clause. Commerzbank vigorously defended the claims, saying that Dresdner Bank . was entitled to reduce the bonuses in the light of the significant . deterioration in the investment bank's performance in late 2008. It said that the August announcement was . neither intended to have contractual effect - nor had such effect - but . amounted to no more than the provision of information as to the bank's . genuine intentions, while the claimants merely continued to do the jobs . they were well paid to do. The judge said that he was satisfied that the promise made by Dr Jentzsch gave rise to a contractual obligation. The average pay of bosses at . Britain’s biggest public companies rose by 11 per cent last year to . £3.65million, according to research published yesterday. The study, compiled for the BBC by Manifest, the adviser to . shareholders, looked at the annual reports of 60 of the companies in the . FTSE 100 index. On . average, a chief executive gets a basic annual salary of £840,000, a . long-term incentive plan of £1.14million, a cash bonus of £689,000 plus . several other lucrative perks, according to the research. But the average worker in the private sector is losing ground, according to a report from the pay experts Incomes Data Services. The average pay rise handed out by bosses to their cash-strapped workers . between January and March was 3 per cent, it says. It comes at a time . when inflation is 3.5 per cent. The report found that 8 per cent of . workers, who typically are employed in manufacturing, construction or . the not-for-profit sector, had their pay frozen. If the claimants had not won on that point, they would have succeeded on . the MAC clause issue which, he added, was introduced in breach of the . implied terms of the contracts of employment. Today, the judge said: 'I have come to the conclusion that the claimants are entitled to payment of bonuses provisionally awarded to them. 'I would simply add . that, whilst these claims arose in 2008 against the background of the . major crisis in the international banking industry and whilst the . subject of bonuses paid to those employed in the banking sector remains a . subject of intense public interest, the issues to which these claims . gave rise arose within a narrow ambit and concern the nature and . existence of contractual obligations owed to the claimants by their . employer. 'They did not concern wider issues as to the structure of remuneration within the banking industry.' During the hearing, Commerzbank CEO . Martin Blessing said: 'If the court rules that it was contractually . binding, of course I will accept it and pay.' However, a spokesman for the bank said later: 'We are disappointed with the court’s decision and will seek leave to appeal. 'The bank believes that the decision to reduce discretionary bonuses in light of £5.2billion of losses at Dresdner Kleinwort for 2008 was responsible and justified. 'The main argument revolves around whether the announcement on August 18 amounted to a legally binding agreement. 'It is the Bank’s submission that there is every prospect that the Court of Appeal would come to a different view on this matter.' As well as being ordered to pay the . bonuses, Commerzbank could face a legal bill of up to £20million for a . hearing lasting more than three weeks. But they immediately announced . plans to appeal. Later, Mark Levine, a partner at law firm Mishcon de Reya, which represented 21 of the claimant bankers, said: 'We welcome the High Court's decision today confirming the Bank's contractual obligation to pay retention awards promised to our clients in exceptional circumstances in 2008. 'Dresdner made repeated promises to employees prior to its sale to Commerzbank in an attempt to avoid a mass exodus of staff - namely that they would be financially rewarded from a guaranteed retention pool for remaining at the bank and performing well. 'We welcome the High Court ruling that these promises constituted a binding contract and, with the staff having performed their side of the contract, that the bank breached it by refusing to honour the payments it had promised. 'This case is likely to have significance whenever employment contracts are varied, particularly on the basis of verbal commitments or actions.","Win for 104 London investment bankers .

Marks & Spencer has mobilised 4,500 staff to join local residents in mounting litter patrols on 100 of the country’s beaches. The store is one of many businesses to have backed the Daily Mail’s Spring Clean for the Queen campaign, pledging to do its best to rid our environment of litter in the run-up to the main Jubilee celebrations next month. The M&S staff – drawn from every level of the company – are joining an expected 3,000 community volunteers to clear beaches over the weekend. Mucking in: Volunteers from Marks & Spencer help with the clean-up at Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex . Yesterday saw a combined total of some 4,000 staff and residents rally to the cause at the first 36 beaches on their hit list, including Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex, Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, Sand Bay near Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, and Cramond in Edinburgh. Between them, they filled 1,500 black bin bags with rubbish weighing 5,500kg. That included around 1,600 tin cans and 7,350 wrappers. The good spirit and fun of the operation was perfectly illustrated at Shoreham, where, despite blustery winds, around 150 people collected 31 black bin bags  full of litter weighing a total of 46.25kg in just over an hour, covering a mile stretch. Graphic designer Lisa Doyle, 32, who had donned pink wellies to help out, said: ‘When we first  got here and looked at the beach it didn’t look like it had any litter on it at all. Yesterday saw 4,000 staff and residents rally to the cause at the first 36 beaches on their hit list, including Shoreham (above), Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, Sand Bay near Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, and Cramond in Edinburgh . 'But when you start looking really close, you realise there’s all these little bits all over the place.’ Chloe Gray, 34, who works in M&S’s fish team, said: ‘It was mostly plastic, but we were amazed at some of the stuff we found... which included a pink thong. ‘It’s been a great day and it feels good to do your bit for the environment and help keep the  country clean.’ Shoreham is a shingle beach dotted with vegetation, including sea kale and curled dock. Mark Atherton-Ranson, agriculture manager at Marks & Spencer in London, with beach litter . It is one of only a few of its kind in the UK, New Zealand and Japan and is a Site of Special  Scientific Interest. Children from three schools also helped out there, using metal detectors to locate cans and aerosols while enjoying a sunny day out of the classroom at the seaside. Laura Hollis, ten, from Glebe Primary School, said: ‘It was fun and we liked helping. We know it’s bad if people leave these things on the beach because they can stay around for ages.’ As well as being a blot on the coastline, much of the rubbish found at Shoreham, as elsewhere, would be harmful to birds and fish should they swallow it or become trapped in it. Among the unusual items discovered on beaches during yesterday’s operation were a set of false teeth, a pair of tights, a baseball, various odd socks, a jumper, and some plastic ‘vampire fangs’. All the litter collectors at each beach were issued with gloves, litter pickers and bin bags. The collected rubbish was later handed over to councils for disposal. The M&S Big Beach Clean-Up project is run in conjunction with the Marine Conservation Society and is in its first year. Bosses organised the events in response to surveys by the MCS,  which showed litter levels on beaches were unacceptably high. Andy Bool, head of fundraising at the MCS, said most – around 60 per cent – of the litter found on UK beaches is plastic such as bottle tops and cable ties, followed by food wrappers, then rope from the fishing industry or sea anglers’ discarded line. Richard Gillies, director of M&S’s ethical programme Plan A, said: ‘Our customers care passionately about where their food comes from, especially fish. ‘We only source from the most sustainable sources, but this is something more, this is our chance to get out on to beaches with our customers and take direct action to help protect marine life and our coastline.’ The operation is funded by the 5p carrier bag charge in M&S foodhalls, launched to combat the chronic number of bags littering our streets and waterways. Since its introduction in 2008, the charge has reduced carrier bag use by 80 per cent and raised over £4million for charity. M&S has pledged to give every volunteer who registers in advance a money-off voucher and provide snacks during the clean, which continues at locations around the country today and tomorrow.

It's the first time scientists have understood what makes neurons 'die' - and is described as a 'major breakthrough' in the study of brain diseases, say Leicester University researchers . A chemical command that halts brain cells dying in mice could offer hope to human sufferers of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The command makes mice suffering an incurable brain disease live longer. It's the first time scientists have understood what makes neurons 'die' - and is described as a 'major breakthrough'. Having found the pathway, the scientists then worked out how to block it, and were able to prevent brain cells from dying, helping the mice live longer. They also suspect that there is a common mechanism by which brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and CJD damage the nerve cells - and that it can perhaps be blocked in the same way. Eric Karran, director of research at the . charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said while the research was still at . an early stage, the results were exciting. ‘While . neurodegenerative diseases can have many different triggers, this study . suggests that they may act through a common mechanism to damage nerve . cells. The findings present the appealing concept that one treatment . could have benefits for a range of different diseases,’ he said. Roger . Morris, a professor of molecular neurobiology at King's College London . who was not involved in the work, said the finding was ‘a major . breakthrough in understanding what kills neurons in neurodegenerative . disease’. ‘There are good . reasons for believing this response, identified with prion disease, . applies also to Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases,’ he . said. Human prion: 'The fact that in mice with prion disease we were able to manipulate this mechanism and protect the brain cells means we may have a way forward in how we treat other disorders,¿ say the researchers . British researchers writing in the journal Nature said they had found a major pathway leading to brain cell death in mice with prion disease, the mouse equivalent of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease. In neurodegenerative diseases, proteins ‘mis-fold’ in a various ways, leading to a build up of misshapen proteins, the researchers explained in the study. These misshapen proteins form the plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's and the Lewy bodies found in Parkinson's disease. ‘What's exciting is the emergence of a common mechanism of brain cell death, across a range of different neurodegenerative disorders, activated by the different mis-folded proteins in each disease,’ said Giovanna Mallucci, who led the research at the University of Leicester's toxicology unit. ‘The fact that in mice with prion disease we were able to manipulate this mechanism and protect the brain cells means we may have a way forward in how we treat other disorders,’ she said. An estimated 18 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's is thought to affect around one in 100 people over the age of 60. In these diseases, neurons in the brain die, destroying the brain from the inside. But why the neurons die has remained an unsolved mystery, presenting an obstacle to developing effective treatments and to being able to diagnose the illnesses at early stages when medicines might work better.","'Switching off' pathway stops mouse brain cells dying .

In the future, robots could be 'printed off' in an IKEA-style revolution which could bring robot servants into every home. A new £6.25 million science project aims to speed up the creation of robots so the machines become more like Lego kits - or Swedish furniture. Ordering a robot could be as simple as buying a new chest of drawers - and a fully customised machine would be ready within 24 hours. 'I'm sure I ordered a Dalek': New 'kit' robots could mean that home servants will be able to be ordered, assembled and ready for work in 24 hours . It's uncertain whether the team's robotic servants will have the camp, otherworldly charm of C3P0 and R2-D2 . Home users would simply list the tasks they need their new robo-Jeeves to handle, then a website would suggest which abilities their robots would need. The scientists behind the project have not speculated on how much our new robot servants might cost. Researchers in the US have launched a project aimed at developing desk-top technology that will make household robots as commonplace as flatpack furniture. The key to the process is 3-D printing, the automated manufacture of plastic and metal machine components from a set of instructions. Scientists hope to create a platform that will enable people to choose from a ‘library’ of robot designs. Once a particular problem is identified, the householder would choose from a selection of robot blueprints. The programme would allow a fully functioning customised robot to be assembled and ready for action within 24 hours. ‘Our goal is to develop technology that enables anyone to manufacture their own customised robot,’ said Professor Vijay Kumar, one of the researchers from the University of Pennsylvania. ‘This is truly a game-changer.’ Kumar's laboratory specialises in robots that operates in teams, and famously created a team of 'quadrotor' flying robots which played the James Bond theme. Incredible: The flying robots are shown hovering over their individual keys, ready to press them in time . Currently it takes years to design, produce and programme a fully functioning robot. The process is costly, involving hardware and software design, machine learning and vision, and advanced programming techniques. The new technology would fully automate production, allowing individuals to build functioning robots from materials as easily accessible as a sheet of paper. A $10 million (£6.25 million) grant from the US National Science Foundation is funding the five-year project. Crash! One robot's job was to hover over a drum and bash it in time to the music . Team leader Professor Daniela Rus, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), said: ‘This research envisions a whole new way of thinking about the design and manufacturing of robots, and could have a profound impact on society. ‘We believe that it has the potential to transform manufacturing and to democratise access to robots.’ So far prototype machines have been used to produce an insect-like robot for exploring contaminated areas, and a gripper designed to help disabled people. ‘It's really exciting to think about the kind of impact this work could have on the general population, beyond just a few select people who work in robotics,’ said Dr Wojciech Matusik, also from CSAIL.","'Kit' robots to turn robotics into a reality in the home .

"By . Rachel Quigley . UPDATED: . 13:40 EST, 1 August 2011 . Pampered: Despite her brand's woes, Martha is said to insist on keeping nine personal assistants and still expenses everything . Her brand and image at one time seemed unstoppable and everything she touched turned to gold. But a spell in prison, in-house disputes, bad decision making, the recession and the emergence of younger, leaner rivals has seen the Martha Stewart brand suffer a huge fall from grace. Not that you would know by looking at the celebrity homemaker-turned-former prison inmate. According to sources close to Ms Stewart, she allegedly insists on having nine personal assistants and expenses almost everything in her life - due in part to the fact that it is never clear where Martha Stewart the person ends and Martha Stewart the brand begins. According to New York Magazine, her expenses have long been a sticking point between her and her CFOs, because everything she does or buys in her personal life can be used for her TV show or magazine or even be used in a tweet. Between her farm in Bedford, her home in Maine, a house in East Hampton, and an apartment on Fifth Avenue, Ms Stewart is said to have steep personal bills to pay. But it is alleged she expenses an extraordinary amount of them, including use of a driver, personal trainer and home security system. And with Ms Stewart - who turns 70 this week - due to return to the board of directors of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia this fall when her five-year ban comes to an end, it is not likely that these extravagances will be curbed. A former executive also claims that despite the fact MSLO is losing money daily, she still insists on keeping 'nine personal assistants'. The executive told NY magazine: 'Nine. That number is untouchable. I broached it with her and I almost lost my job that day.' She is also said to keep three separate test kitchens and think nothing of sending employees to far-off places like India, just to buy a certain piece of fabric. Lows: Martha Stewart leaves Manhattan Federal Court after she was sentenced to five months in prison and two years probation for lying to investigators about her sale of ImClone Systems stock in 2002 . Ups and downs: Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc stock prices showing their rise and fall from 2002 to present day, with a 2005 high after she left prison . Highs: Martha has become an iconic brand name which households all over America are familiar with. At one time anything the homemaker - who turns 70 this week - touched, turned to gold . Ms Stewart - whose net worth is believed to be $638 million - served five months in prison in 2004 for lying to investigators in an insider-trading case. She began a comeback campaign in 2005 and her company returned to profit in 2006. One-time saviour: MSLO CEO Charles Koppelman with fiancée Gerri Kyhill, they are due to marry in October . But the recession hit her company hard and the MSLO share price remains around the $4 mark - $4.18 at time of writing - when in its hey day it was as high as $36. It sunk to its lowest in 2009 at a mere $1.73. MSLO has been profitable in only one of the past eight years - losing a whopping $185million on the way. According to New York Magazine, in the fourth quarter of last year, on . the verge of violating loan covenants, the company had to renegotiate . its debt with Bank of America. Her television programme on Hallmark has been cut from eight hours to five and the brand has struggled to replace the revenue it used to enjoy through its licensing partnership with Kmart. CEO Charles Koppleman is due to leave by the year's end after enjoying a tumultuous business relationship with Ms Stewart. He was at one time seen as her saviour but is now being held by some as being responsible for the demise of the Martha Stewart brand. But his exit from the company will be cushioned by a very generous exit package, which includes a $1.47 million severance payment and up to $35,000 for the attorneys who worked on his new arrangement, according to Deadline New York. The filing says he'll remain on the MSLO board as 'Non-Executive Chairman, Vice Chairman or Special Committee Chairman'. That will entitle him to an initial $50,000 in stock rights as well as rights to 100,000 shares. Among her many homes is a large estate in Bedford, NY called Cantitoe . Keeping it in the family: Her daughter Alexis Stewart, right, is co-host of the show Whatever Martha alongside Koppelman's daughter Jennifer Koppelman Hutt . But despite this, and for a man who in 2008 commanded $8million in compensation from MSLO, his gift registry at Williams-Sonoma does not reflect his vast fortune. 1961 - Married Andrew Stewart . 1967 - Became a stockbroker . 1982 - First cookbook Entertaining released becoming New York Times best-seller . 1989 - Divorced husband . 1990 - Martha Stewart Living launched . 1993 - Launched her TV career . 1995 - New York Magazine declared her as 'the definitive American woman of our time' 1997 - Founds Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia . 1999 - MSLO goes public on New York Stock Exchange . 2003 - Indicted on nine counts including securities fraud and obstruction of justice . July 2004 - Found guilty and sentenced to five months in a federal correctional facility .

In his up-coming wedding with Gerri Kyhill, who runs the New York outlet of the pole-dancing exercise chain S Factor, they request gifts including a $45 cutting board and $49 hotel napkins. In 2008, MSLO’s ­human-resources department sent . an e-mail to employees offering pole-dancing classes at S Factor as a . company-paid benefit. Ms Kyhill and S Factor’s founder, Sheila Kelley, also . led Ms Stewart through a now-infamous pole-dancing routine on her television show. Mr Koppelman's daughter Jennifer Koppelman Hutt is co-host of Whatever, Martha! with Ms Stewart's daughter Alexis. Last year she was paid $350,000 while Alexis made $400,000. With Ms Stewart poised to go back on the board of directors in the Fall and with Mr Koppelman playing a less hands-on role, it remains to be seen if she can salvage what is left of the much-loved brand, despite having younger and leaner rivals snapping at her heels. Former executives believe that no matter what happens to the company, the 69-year-old cannot help but feel that she deserves to be paid well, with one attributing her obsession with compensation to her humble origins: 'I think she still has the fear that she will end up with nothing.' This was the billionaire, after all, who had risked everything over a $51,000 stock trade.

"By . Nick Pisa On Giglio Island and Pamela Owen . UPDATED: . 12:27 EST, 22 January 2012 . Captain Francesco Schettino who abandoned the ship before his passengers . Cruise ship captain Francesco Schettino has claimed that his bosses knew about the tradition of 'sail by salutes' and that he was asked to do them for publicity stunts, it has emerged. The news comes as the death toll rises to 13 and the number of people missing 20. The body of a woman was found by rescuers on deck seven, about 10 metres below the water line. It has also emerged that there could be a number of unregistered passengers aboard the ship, making the number of missing people much higher. According to details of an interview . with Schettino, 52, he said that Costa Cruises 'knew about the regular . practice' of sailing close by islands and it was carried out 'all around . the world'. He told prosecutors and the . investigating judge, in documents leaked by the Italian media, that the . company planned the salutes to time with local public holidays on the . islands they were due to cruise past. Schettino's latest claims were a direct contradiction of what Costa chief Pierluigi Foschi said last week at a press conference where he said a 'sail by had been authorised just once before' in the summer of 2010 off the island of Procida, close to Naples. His version of events in the 135 page judicial document now raises serious questions over just what Costa Cruises knew the night of the disaster and it may explain why Schettino waited for more than an hour to raise the alarm and why he made a series of phone calls to company chiefs at their HQ in Genoa. They have always insisted that he had 'lied to them' over the incident where the Concordia scrapped rocks and that he made a 'serious error of judgement' in sailing so close past the island of Giglio - just 350ft instead of the regulatory five miles. Schettino said: 'The salute to Giglio was arranged and wanted by Costa before we left Civitavecchia [the port of departure]. It was for publicity reasons. We have carried out those sail by salutes all over the world - Sorrento, Capri. I have sailed past Giglio other times - when I was captain of Costa Europa.' 'The sail past Giglio had been advertised in the daily ship news letter - we should have done it the week before but we couldn't because the weather had been bad. They insisted. They said, ""We can be seen and we can get some publicity"", so I said OK. Schettino, who grounded the Costa Concordia, said that it was common for a 'sail by' to be performed and that his employers knew about it . Rescuers have found a 13 body, that of a woman, on deck seven of the wreckage . 'The plan was that we should have been around half a nautical mile off the coast but in the end we were 0.28 of a nautical mile away,' adding how Costa knew all about the sail pasts and that they had always been happy for him to do so. Schettino also told judge Valeria Montesarchio how he called Costa operations manager Roberto Ferrarini the night of the disaster and told him that he intended to turn the boat around and sail towards the port of Giglio and try and beach the ship. He said: 'Ferrarini said to me ""Yes...do that.."" then when the ship had grounded and we spoke again he said, ""At this point...more than this...we won't sink anymore,"" although more than 300 passengers and crew were still onboard at the time and needed to be evacuated. Schettino also added how in one final call Ferrarini had asked him to download all the detail from the Voice Data Recorder on the bridge's black box and added: 'I'll be honest with you. For the 15 days beforehand we had been reporting that the VDR was broken and we had asked for it to be fixed but it never was. He has been ridiculed for abandoning the vessel before passengers and one of the latest recordings, released by Italy’s La Repubblica newspaper, an official can be heard asking the captain whether everyone is going to abandon ship. Sounding breathless, Schettino replies: ‘I’m going to stay here.’ The coastguard asks again: ‘So only you are going to stay there?’ The owners of the ship are now offering a 30 per cent discount to survivors in a bid to stave off any legal action . The wreckage is a huge blight on the coast of Giglio but there has been an increase in visitors to see the liner . He replies: ‘I’m the only one who will stay here.’ Signing off, the coastguard says:  ‘Very good, Captain. Continue with the evacuation and we’ll speak later. Keep your mobile with you.’ In another tape recording released last week, an exasperated Gregorio De Falco, head of the local coastguard, ordered Schettino back to his ship to co-ordinate the rescue. The captain later told investigators he ‘tripped and fell’ into a lifeboat. Officials have also said there could be a number of unregistered passengers aboard the vessel, complicating the issue of exactly how many people are missing. 'There could have been X persons who we don't know about who were inside, who were clandestine passengers aboard the ship,' said Franco Gabrielli, the national civil protection official in charge of the rescue effort. Gabrielli said that relatives of a Hungarian woman told Italian authorities that she had telephoned them from aboard the ship and that they haven't heard from her since the accident. People have been flocking to the island for day trips to take pictures of themselves near the sunken ship . He said it was possible that a woman's body pulled from the wreckage by divers on Saturday might be that of the unregistered passenger. But the identity of that body and of three male bodies, all badly decomposed after days in the water, have yet to be established. Gabrielli said they have identified eight other bodies: four French, an Italian, a Hungarian, a German and a Spanish national. Until Sunday, authorities had said that 20 people are still missing. Meanwhile the owners of the Costa Concordia are offering survivors a 30 per cent discount off future cruises in a bid to stave off lawsuits expected to costs hundreds of million of pounds. The decision will be an insult to passengers, many of whom are still battling to get over the trauma of what happened that night. A spokesman for Costa Cruises said they were trying to do everything possible to keep their customers happy and said the discount would be offered to those wanting to stay loyal to the company. He refused to comment about the ongoing investigation.","Divers have found the body of a woman bringing the death toll to 13 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:19 EST, 20 October 2011 . Greek protesters have taken to the streets of Athens for a second successive day over the country's rescue package which might not be enough to save Greece from bankruptcy. Angry protesters swelled into a crowd of thousands outside the Parliament buildings in Athens today, as tensions over the country's debt crisis threatened to spill over into violent clashes with police once again. Greeks frustrated at the strict 'austerity laws' set to be approved this evening launched a 'general strike' outside Parliament which is set to last for 48 hours. Chaos: Riot police help a fellow officer whose clothing caught fire after being hit by a petrol bomb . Explosive: Union protesters run from a fore bomb hurled towards them in Athens as clashes from the general strike turned violent . Injured: A protester sits bleeding during clashes near the Parliament building in Athens . The protests had escalated yesterday into violence against police with petrol bombs and and rocks, and the demonstration turned ugly again today. Inspectors from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund have described Greece's debt dynamics as 'extremely worrying.' Greece is said to have missed its deficit-cutting targets, while an inspectors' report added that the pace of its reforms is insufficient. Clashes: The protest turned nasty when masked youths attacked a peaceful demonstration, leading to this protester and others being covered in pink paint . Police were forced to fire tear gas and stun grenades when masked youths attacked demonstrators . Protest: A huge crowd of demonstrators shout and wave banners outside the Greek parliament in Athens for a second successive day in opposition to the country's harsh 'austerity laws' The 48-hour general strike had turned violent yesterday in Athens, and threatened to spill into clashes again today as crowds swelled . It emerged today that Athens will receive an 8 billion euro bailout loan so the country can avoid bankruptcy next month. Greece has been relying on a 110 billion euro ($152 billion) package of rescue loans since May last year. The inspectors' report warned, however, that a second bailout for the country tentatively agreed to on July 21 does not make its massive debts sustainable. Clashes: A protester throws a petrol bomb at police during a rally on the first day of a 48-hour general strike in Athens, Greece . Rotting: A woman holds her nose as she passes piles of rubbish in the Athens district of Athens, which has been paralysed by the strike . Angry: Strikers shouted slogans in front of the Greek Parliament building during the 48-hour revolt . It was claimed yesterday that fat-cat Greeks have secretly shifted more than €228billion euros out of their country's crisis-hit banks and into accounts in Switzerland. The big money is fleeing the country as rich Greeks fear the possible re-introduction of their old currency, the drachma, would instantly halve the value of their euros if they are left in Greek banks. Most of the money is being transferred via Cyprus by Greek industrialists using their foreign subsidiaries to channel it out of the debt-ridden country, where tens of thousands of workers launched a general strike yesterday. Markus Korll, from the German financial services group Roland Berger, told Bild: 'During the past few months alone more than 10billion euros has been moved abroad.' Greek newspapers have also reported that people flying abroad - including nuns, priests and the unemployed - are being stopped at Athens airport with suitcases full of euros. Clashes: Locals walk past a broken window in Athens following yesterday's violence with police, which saw petrol bombs and rocks thrown at officers . Crowd swell: The number of protesters had topped 50,000 yesterday, with a similar number gathering outside the Greek parliament today . Violence: The last 48-hour general strike in June also saw scores of arrests in the Greek capital . Tear gas: A protester runs for cover after cannisters were fired by the police. The Greek prime minister has called on people not to hamper the recovery by going on strike . Martin Schulz, leader of the Social Democrats in the European Parliament, called for the Swiss to impose a 25 per cent tax on the money. He said: 'In this way we can at least limit this massive flight of capital. 'People secretly moving millions out of the country can't be poor. They must pay their share. 'I can understand why the 'little people' are taking to the streets to rebel against this injustice.' Bild says that Greek banking bosses have already warned the government about the growing panic at bank cash desks and the ever-increasing flood of capital abroad. Government advisers are also warning of the dangers of a Northern-Rock style storm outside the banks and the need for capital controls, including disconnecting ATM machines, the paper reports. Resentment: An estimated 50,000 protesters have converged on the centre of Athens to rally against austerity measures due to be passed tomorrow . No nonsense: Riot police stand shoulder to shoulder as they try to prevent the march of protesters . The two-day general strike which started yesterday grounded flights, disrupted public transport and shut down everything from shops to schools today - as at least 50,000 protesters converged in central Athens. Violent clashes broke out between riot police and protesters near the Greek parliament building, with petrol bombs and rocks being thrown at officers. All sectors, from dentists, state hospital doctors and lawyers to shop owners, tax office workers and dock workers walked off the job ahead of a parliament vote tomorrow on new austerity measures. Protest: A demonstrator hurls a petrol bomb at police during clashes in Athens . Graffiti: A demonstrator, wearing a gas mask, stands in front of a bank entrance in Athens . Stand: A protester wears a mask and prison uniform outside the Greek parliament building in Syntagma Square . Ferries remained tied up in port, while public transport workers staged stoppages, although buses, trolleys and the Athens metro were expected to remain in operation. Several thousand police deployed in the capital, blocking a road by parliament and shutting down two nearby metro stations. Nikos Anastasopoulos, heard of a workers' union for an Athens municipality, said: 'We just can't take it any more. There is desperation, anger and bitterness.' Demonstrations during a similar 48-hour strike in June left the centre of Athens badly damaged as rioters clashed with police. Piles of rubbish continue to rot on street corners despite a civil mobilisation order issued yesterday to order crews back to work after a 17-day strike. Civil servants have also staged sit-ins in government buildings, including the Finance Ministry. The new austerity measures have been so unpopular that MPs from the governing Socialist have indicated they might vote against some of them. But Greece must pass the bills if it is to continue receiving funds from its 110billion euro bailout.

It’s not the sort of thing most fans want to go through before a football match, but security checks are going to get a whole lot tougher. The NFL wants the 16.6 million fans expected to attend live regular season games this season to go through ‘enhanced’ pat-downs. All 32 clubs have been asked to search fans from the ankles to the knees as well as the waist up, as they aim to improve stadium security. Checks: A stadium security officer pats down a fan before a pre-season NFL game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Houston Texans last month . In the past security guards only used to pat down fans from the waist up before they got into NFL stadiums, reported USA Today. The NFL is asking fans to be patient and get to games earlier than before to avoid huge delays at the entrance gates. ‘Enhanced security procedures (will) further increase the safety of fans but will require some additional time,’ an NFL spokesman told USA Today. ‘We encourage fans to come early, enjoy their tailgating tradition, and be patient as they enter the stadium.’ Longer wait: A Minnesota Vikings fan raises his jersey as he passes through security personnel for a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last Sunday . It comes after a man from South Carolina was arrested for using an illegal taser gun on other fans at a game in New Jersey at the MetLife Stadium. 'We encourage fans to come early, enjoy their tailgating tradition, and be patient as they enter the stadium' NFL spokesman . The New York Jets were playing the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. But the NFL said its new measures were proposed before the season began.

Little over a month ago he was 'at death's door', comatose and being kept alive with oxygen and an intravenous drip. But yesterday Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi – the only man convicted of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland and killing 270 people – was again well enough to protest his innocence. In better health: Abdelbaset Al Megrahi reclines at his home during yesterday's interview . The former Libyan intelligence officer, who is suffering from prostate cancer, claimed his role in the 1988 attack had been 'exaggerated'. Megrahi has consistently denied involvement in the atrocity – thought to be motivated by tensions between Libya and the U.S. – that brought down the London to New York flight, killing all 259 on board as well as 11 on the ground. He said: 'The West exaggerated my name. The facts will become clear one day and hopefully in the near future. In a few months from now, you will see new facts that will be announced.' When filmed at the family's palatial Tripoli villa five weeks ago, a gaunt Megrahi was wearing an oxygen mask and attached to a drip. His family had to speak on his behalf as he lay unconscious. But yesterday he was able to speak for himself. He had more colour in his cheeks, though still looked frail, as he said: 'Please leave me alone. I only have a few more days, weeks or months.' An oxygen tank was among the medical equipment surrounding his bed but the Libyan, wearing a white head-dress, did not use an oxygen mask during his interview with the Reuters news agency. Helpless: A relative administers oxygen from a bedside tank. Al Megrahi claims armed groups had invaded his home and mistreated him since the fall of Gaddafi . Reclining on a cushion featuring a brightly coloured picture from the children's cartoon Pokemon, Megrahi described the trial – held under Scottish jurisdiction in Camp Zeist, a Dutch court – that led to his conviction as a farce. He said: 'Camp Zeist Court is the smallest place on earth that contains the largest number of liars. I suffered from the liars at Camp Zeist Court more than you can imagine.' Upon Megrahi's release from a Scottish jail, he returned to Libya, where he was hailed as a hero. Labour ministers repeatedly claimed the decision to free Megrahi, incensing Lockerbie victims' families, was taken solely by the Scottish Executive on 'compassionate grounds'. But documents have now come to light showing that Labour secretly helped free Megrahi to appease Colonel Gaddafi, who was threatening to scupper oil contracts and unleash 'holy war' on Britain. Hero's welcome: Al Megrahi is met by cheering crowds after being freed from jail on compassionate grounds despite fierce opposition . Megrahi said he had little knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's overthrow earlier this year and claimed Libyan opposition fighters had invaded his home and mistreated him. 'My house has been violated,' he said. 'They smashed the main door and stole my cars.' He denied any role in the human rights abuses committed by the Gaddafi regime, saying: 'All my work was administrative. I've never harmed anyone in my life.' Megrahi claimed he was being denied medical treatment, which he said was stipulated in the deal that saw him returned to Libya. He is believed to have been taking a drug which costs £3,000 a month. With the fall of the Gaddafi regime, which funded him, his supply from the U.S. has been interrupted and in August the bomber's family made an astonishing appeal to Britain for help to prolong his life. Megrahi said: 'I was treated badly when I came back. During the latest incidents, especially in the last month, I have a shortage of all my medicines. I have four pills left [of one of the medications]. 'I want to die in my house, among my family. I hope to God that I will see my country united, with no fighting or war.' He wore a checked shirt and had a white headdress wrapped loosely around his head. He claimed he was still in contact with Jim Swire, a father of one of the victims of the bombing who has disputed the court's findings. He added: 'The day before yesterday, Dr Swire sent me an email to tell me that there is a new medicine. He is trying to help me. He told me how to get this medicine.' Al-Megrahi claimed he had little knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's overthrow and that the armed groups which toppled the dictator had invaded his home and mistreated him. Retreat: A red cross convoy taking supplies into the town of Sirte where fighting continues was forced to turn around after encountering a hail of weapons' fire . He said: 'I don't know anything about February 17th...that's not a question for a sick person. 'I hear airplanes overhead every day,' he said, referring to NATO planes which have bombed sites in Libya. 'My house has been violated. They smashed the main door and stole my cars.' He said he was being denied medical treatment which he said was stipulated in the deal that saw him returned from Scotland to Libya. 'I was treated badly when I came back. During the latest incidents, especially in the last month, I have a shortage of all my medicines. 'My doctor tells me to look for medicine like anyone else despite the agreement between us and Britain,' he said. 'I have four pills left. 'I want to die in my house, among my family. I hope to God that I will see my country united, with no fighting or war. I hope the bloodshed will stop in Libya. I wish all the best for my country.' Barrage: Anti-Gaddafi forces are continuing to attack Sirte where there have reports of an unfolding humanitarian crisis . Elsewhere in Libya, a Red Cross convoy carrying aid to relieve a worsening humanitarian crisis in Libya's besieged city of Sirte had to turn back after ant-Gaddafi forces unleashed a barrage of gunfire. Aid agencies say they are concerned about the welfare of civilians inside Sirte, the hometown of deposed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who are trapped by the fighting and running out of food, water, fuel and medical supplies. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) took some supplies into Sirte last week, and it tried again on Monday, assembling a convoy of two trucks carrying accompanied by two four-wheel drive vehicles. The convoy set off from a bridge a few kilometres west of Sirte but came to a halt after only about 100 metres because interim government forces started firing into the city. They fired a heavy barrage of mortars, artillery, rocket-propelled grenades and anti-aircraft weapons just as the convoy was starting to move. The ICRC convoy turned around and headed back west, away from Sirte. Exodus: Families flee the danger zone in a truck piled high with their personal possessions as fighting continues in the Gadaffi's hometown Sirte . An anti-Gaddafi commander at the scene, Ismail Al-Sosi, told reporters: 'The rebels secured the way for the International Red Cross to go but as soon as they entered the city they returned because of the militias firing. We did not start the firing. The militias started the firing.' Speaking just before the aborted attempt to get supplies into the city, Hishem Khadrawy, an ICRC official, said the humanitarian situation there was dire. He said: 'We're trying to provide medical assistance and oxygen to the hospital in Sirt,'said  'We are really concerned about the medical situation because of the conflict.' Civilians fleeing the town spoke of many other people who were unable to leave and and faced deteriorating conditions. Boshnab Khalifa who managed to escape the city with his family said: 'We were in our apartment and then the wall was blown in by a rocket. 'The situation is very bad. Our family and our friends are trapped inside. They cannot get out. There are many families trapped inside, some have no gas for their cars, other (cars) have been damaged or destroyed.' Another resident fleeing Sirte, Mohammed Diap, claimed pro-Gaddafi militias were barring people from getting out. He said: 'There is no food, no water, no power. Some are trapped because there is no fuel, others are trapped because of the militias. (file picture) Nato are concerned over the whereabouts of thousands of Russian-made Sam-7 surface to air missiles which have disappeared since the fall of Gaddafi . 'The people who are trapped inside are in danger. There is random shelling everywhere.' A city of about 75,000 people, Sirte holds symbolic importance. Gaddafi, known for his self-aggrandising gestures, transformed his birthplace from a sleepy fishing town into Libya's second capital. At his instigation, parliament often sat in Sirte and he hosted international summits at the Ouagadougou Hall, a marble-clad conference centre he had built on a desert plot in the south of the city. Nato is urging Libya's new government to ensure the security of arms caches left behind by the Gaddafi's regime. Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said:  'It's a matter of concern if stockpiles of weapons are not properly controlled and monitored.' He was answering questions about reports that thousands of SAM-7 portable surface-to-air missiles allegedly went missing after the collapse of the regime. The United States and other Western nations are trying to reduce the global stock of such missiles, fearing they could fall into the hands of terrorists. The small, easily concealable SAM-7s are considered obsolete by modern military standards but could pose a threat to civil airliners. In Tripoli Libya's post-Gaddafi leaders have named a new Cabinet and vow to step down after the country is fully secured. The announcement comes after weeks of political infighting stalled efforts to form a new government. The head of the National Transitional Council, Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, and the de facto prime minister, Mahmoud Jibril, say they'll stay in their posts until Moammar Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte is captured. But they say they have signed a pledge 'not to take part in any future government in any way'.","Al Megrahi claims facts of the bombing will 'become clear one day'

Now his ragged appearance makes Brad Pitt's foray into the forest of facial hair look positively restrained. Hirsute rugby player Adam Kleeberger is desperate to cut out the caveman act - only his fans won't let him. Because he's worth it: Adam Kleeberger looks as though he could be selling shampoo rather than playing rugby for his country . The furry flanker is now trending on Twitter because of those tangled locks - which topped off his man-of-the-match performance in Canada's win over Tonga at the rugby world cup on Wednesday. 'It would be pretty hard for me not to shave it off,' he told the tournament's website. 'I kind of miss having my face. 'But right now I'm just focusing on this Rugby World Cup and I'll think about that afterwards.' The shaggy beard and long hair have been his crowning glory in the eyes of an adoring public after the Canucks' excellent start to the World Cup. They have attracted headlines such as 'Fear the beard' and 'Kleeberger helps his country win by a hair'. One less generous observer added: 'Kleeberger is 27, but his beard looks a bit older'. In a tangle: Fans don't want Kleeberger to chop off his flowing locks . Kleeberger has sparked a fashion for the castaway look among his national team, with Hubert Buydens and Jebb Sinclair also hoping that flowing beards will prove a source of strength. The rugby players are not the first smooth-skinned stars to try out a more rugged style. Boyishly handsome celebrities including Justin Timberlake, Ashton Kutcher and Jared Leto have all gone wild for the low-maintenance look. But Kleeberger has taken his dragged-through-a-hedge-backwards image to new extremes. Head band: Canada team-mate Hubert Buydens (centre) joins Kleeberger in letting his hair down ahead of the Rugby World Cup . The straggly, ginger chin fluff and brilliant play has wowed fans, who describe him as a 'beast'. The fashion-forward flanker - who plays for Canada's British Columbia Bears - is just hoping the publicity will bring in a crop of offers from top teams as a result of the publicity. 'If it does then that's great,' he said. 'I didn't really have a reason for growing the beard when I started and it's now got more attention than I ever thought possible. Chin stroke: The flanker is itching to get rid of his long hair and beard . 'So if that comes (a contract), hopefully it's based on the way I'm playing as well. But it would be nice.' Either way, rugby fans will be shorn of their unlikely style icon when Kleeberger  eventually takes the scissors to his seven months of dedicated hair-growth. But he won't be getting the chop from the Canada team any time soon. The country takes on France this Sunday at the New Zealand tournament, and they are still hoping to win by a whisker.",27-year-old's whiskers a highlight of Rugby World Cup .
"By . Hugo Gye . UPDATED: . 22:34 EST, 19 October 2011 . The gap in life expectancy between . Britain's richest and its poorest areas has grown to as much as 13 years, it was revealed today. A Government study . has warned that 'health inequalities across the UK are increasing' as it emerged that the life expectancy of residents of Kensington and Chelsea is over a decade more than that of Glaswegians. However, people all across the country are in general living longer. The average male life expectancy at birth now stands at 78.2 years, while for women it has reached 82.3 years. Health gap: These maps show the life expectancy for men (left) and women (right) across the regions of the UK - the darker the area, the longer the life expectancy . In the past half decade, average . lifespans have increased by more than a year, according to . the Office for National Statistics. But . Scotland still lags behind the rest of the UK, with life expectancy at . birth of just 75.8 years for males and 80.4 years for females. Even within England, those from the healthiest regions can expect to live two years longer than those from the least healthy. Longer lives: Average life expectancy in the UK has risen to 82.3 for women and 78.2 for men . Life . expectancy in the south-east is 79.7 for males and 83.5 for females, . while in the north-west it stands at just 77.9 for males and 81.1 for . females. Although life expectancy has grown in every region of the UK over the past four years, in some areas the growth has been considerably faster than in others. Growing differences appear to reflect increasing wealth in the South - . particularly in the capital. In London, life expectancy has grown by 1.6 years for males and 1.3 years for females. The . report's authors suggest that London's advantage is . owed not only to the capital's relative wealth but to 'the movement into . London of healthy, employed individuals at low risk of death'. A regional breakdown of the figures shows that the longest-lived areas are all in the south of England. Kensington . and Chelsea has the longest life expectancy by some way, with males . expected to live to 85.1 and females to 89.8, which the study claims is . the result of its 'very affluent' residents. Its neighbouring borough Westminster is second, with other front-runners including areas of Dorset and Surrey. In central Glasgow, by contrast, life expectancy is just 71.6 for males and 78 for females. Several . other areas of Scotland are also lagging far behind the average, as . well as industrial cities such as Manchester and Belfast. Well-heeled: Residents of Kensington & Chelsea have the longest life expectancy in the country, with men and women living well into their eighties . Deprived: Life expectancy for males in central Glasgow is just 71.6 years, the lowest in the UK . The . ONS says that the UK's health gap is due to 'socio-economic status, . health behaviour (for example, alcohol consumption and smoking), . environmental conditions, the proportion of people living with . deprivation, and the availability of local services and resources'. The statistics covered life expectancy from birth in the period 2008-10, and compared them with the figures from 2004-6. The study also looked at life expectancy for those aged 65, which has also increased across the UK. A man who is currently 65 can expect to live a further 18 years, while a woman is likely to live another 20.6 years. TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said the figures should send a 'stark warning' to a Government 'intent on forcing people to retire far later'. He said: 'Life expectancy in deprived areas of the UK is increasing at half the pace of the wealthiest parts of London and the South. People living in these areas can also expect their retirement to be a decade shorter.'","Longest-lived areas all in the south of England .

But despite the Latin American powerhouse's dramatic rise UK taxpayers have been forking out millions of pounds in aid to support them. Brazil's total output last year was worth £1.56trillion - compared with £1.53trillion in Britain, think-tank Cebr said. Powerhouse: Brazil has been listed as sixth in the world economic league table by the Centre for Economics and Business Research . The UK economy grew by just 0.8 per cent last year and contracted by 0.2 per cent in the final quarter, leaving the country on the verge of a double-dip recession. In contrast, economic output rose by 2.7 per cent in Brazil, which has a population of around 200million. Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist at Cebr, . said: 'It's a natural enough movement. Brazil has a large population, . has massive natural resources and strong local industry. It's just a . country set for higher growth.' Britain fell one place to seventh in the world economic rankings while Brazil closed the gap on France and Germany. (2010 positions in brackets) 1. United States (1) 2. China (2) 3. Japan (3) 4. Germany (4) 5. France (5) 6. Brazil (7) 7. Great Britain (6) 8. Italy (8) 9. Russia (10) 10. India (9) Despite the UK's relative decline, money continues to be poured into . wealthy and fast-growing countries such as India, and even aid to . China, second in the world economic league, was ordered to come to an . end only this year. According to figures on the website . of the Department For International Development, £13.6million worth of . taxpayer-funded development schemes for Brazil remained ‘operational’. They . include a scheme to work up environmental projects billed at almost . £9million, another to ‘improve flexibility, agility and responsiveness . in the implementation of DFID regional objectives’ worth more than . £1.2million, and unidentified schemes costing more than £2.4million. Relative decline: Britain has fallen behind Brazil in the world economic output league tables . DFID . officials said that the spending was ‘historic’ and included . projects dating from the 1990s, and that they were listed as remaining . in operation only because of ‘an IT error’. They said today the aid programme for Brazil has recently been closed. However, . they acknowledged that taxpayers’ money is still going in aid to . Brazil, in the form of a £730,000 ‘large emerging economies programme’ to ‘develop a shared agenda and promote global poverty reduction . objectives.’ This project, DFID said, is to be wound down 'this year'. A spokesman said: 'Our Secretary of State has been clear we will not give aid to Brazil in the future to fight poverty.' While cuts in public spending are made in Britain, £1.3 billion — some 16 per cent of the aid budget — is being given to the EU. Good times: Brazil, famous for its carnival in Rio de Janeiro (pictured), overtook Britain in the world's economic league table . Robert Oxley, campaign manager of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: 'It's madness to fund aid for an economy doing much better than ours. 'DfID should stop sending our money to countries who don't need it and focus on helping the world's poorest. 'The Brazilian Government can afford its own aid programmes rather than relying on British taxpayers to fund them instead.' Brazil's growth last year still . represented a severe slowdown on the previous year's 7.5 per cent as . soaring business costs and uncompetitive industries took their toll on . the country's performance.

Busted: Kirsty Hartley outside Bristol Crown Court, following her arrest for cultivating cannabis . A mother-of-two was arrested after she turned her bedroom into a cannabis farm - so she could afford to pay for breast enhancements. Kirsty Hartley, 23, allowed drug dealers to set up a £16,000 drug factory in her bedroom after he promised her £8,000 to spend on cosmetic surgery. But she was arrested after police raided her home in Bristol and found 32 cannabis plants growing there. Bristol Crown Court heard Hartley had been promised the money by a drug dealer if she allowed him to grow the plants, capable of producing drugs with a potential street value of £16,000. She pleaded guilty to producing cannabis at an earlier hearing. Hartley occasionally watered the cannabis plants and tended them when the drug dealer behind the 'sophisticated' drugs factory was unable to do so, the court heard. But the cultivation of the plants swiftly came to an end when police raided the property and seized the drugs and cannabis-growing equipment on December 12 last year. Natural light had been blocked from the room and there was a high-powered light, fans and air filters set up to help the plants grow. At Bristol Magistrates’ Court earlier this month, May Li, prosecuting, said: 'In police interview Miss Hartley said she was offered £8,000 to have the crop in her bedroom. 'She initially refused but he persisted and she gave in. 'She said she had issues with her body and desperately wanted a boob job.' At Wednesday’s sentencing Robert Reid, prosecuting, said the plants could have yielded 1.6kg of cannabis, with a street value of £10 per gram deal. Mr Reid said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the man who had asked Hartley to grow the cannabis in her home. He said Hartley had only one previous offence on her record, a reprimand for being drunk and disorderly when she was 16. £8,000 lure: Kirsty Hartley, 23, grew the drugs in Gatehouse Close, Bristol . Dianne Heys, mitigating, said her client was an unsophisticated offender who was immature and suffering from depression. Cannabis plant: The cultivation could have yielded 1.6kgs of weed . She said Hartley was pressured into committing the offence and was told she would receive £8,000 if the mission of growing the drugs to maturity was accomplished. Ms Heys said: 'She watered the plants only on a couple of occasions and clearly she was engaged by pressure and coercion.' Recorder Peter Towler gave Hartley an 18-month community order, with a year’s supervision by the probation service. He told her: 'People who cultivate the illegal drugs are almost at the top of the tree because, if they don’t, people wouldn’t have drugs to distribute down the chain. 'You succumbed to this individual, who wanted to use a room in your house to grow cannabis.'","Kirsty Hartley, 23, was offered £8,000 towards plastic surgery .

The Queen has opened a new primary school in a Welsh village devastated by a horrific mining disaster - marking a poignant return to the site still haunted by the tragedy after 46 years. A total of 144 people, including 116 children, lost their lives when a coal waste tip slid down a mountain, engulfing a school and surrounding houses in Aberfan in 1966. Today, in a show of her continuing support for the former mining community, Her Majesty unveiled a plaque at Ynysowen Community Primary School during the second and final day of her Diamond Jubilee visit to Wales. Continuing support: Left, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at Aberfan a few days after the disaster in which 144 were killed.

Since the disaster, which all but . wiped out an entire generation of the community’s schoolchildren, the . Queen has visited the village three times. During today's visit, a survivor of the disaster led the Queen on a tour of the new school.Jeff Edwards was aged eight when he became the last person to be pulled still alive from the rubble of his school. Almost half a century later he is the leader of Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council. He proudly showed the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh around Ynsyowen Community Primary School, which is said to symbolise a fresh generation of hope for the valley villagers. 'I asked the Queen to come here and open the new school because it represents a new generation of young people in the community,' Mr Edwards said today. 'The Queen has been very, very supportive of Aberfan and has been to the village four times. 'This school is a symbol of the regeneration of the community but today is also a time for us to look to the past.' He added: 'It is very emotional for all of us here today. We will be looking back on the friends we lost. 'It is also a day of celebration in that we are looking at the regeneration of the community.' He also described how surviving the devastation of the collapse as a child had shaped his outlook on life. 'It has given me that motivation and drive to come into public service and to make something for the people who were not so fortunate as myself,' he said. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were greeted by hundreds of children waving Union flags as they arrived at the eco-friendly school.

He went on to move away and become a solicitor but has since returned to the community. He met the Queen today and went on to speak about how his experience had coloured his life. 'I would say that it makes you take . stock and look at life in a way different to someone who has not . experienced it. You count your blessings,' he said.

The Queen spoke briefly with Craig White, the architect responsible for designing the school. 'I explained that the school had an . upside-down roof which collects all the rain water and the children can . flush the toilets here using rain water. They really like that,' he . said. 'She said that we were never going to be short of water in Wales,' he added. Outside children waited in the rain with Union flags for an extra glimpse of the royal couple.
