A suit that promises to tell how hard you’ve work – or haven’t – has been developed by two students in Canada. Named ‘Athos’, the full-body suit is equipped with tiny sensors that measure muscle output, heart rate and respiration. Scroll down for video... Named 'Athos', the full-body suit is equipped with tiny sensors that measure muscle output, heart rate and respiration. The data is transmitted into a credit card-sized module called 'the core' that wirelessly syncs with an Athos software app . The Athos suit is embedded with tiny sensors that are able to measure a wearer's muscle output, heart rate and breathing rate. The data provides users with a 'muscle effort' score so they know how much they are  pushing themselves. At the same time, heart rate activity is registered so that users can get into the right heart rate zone to improve fitness. The sensors ensure the users have balance by providing data on whether they are stretching and lifting evenly. It will also track their reps and time spent working out. As the wearer moves, electrical activity can be measured on the skin. This is then is converted into useful performance data. The data is transmitted into a credit card-sized module called ‘The Core’ that wirelessly syncs with an Athos software app. The app collects the information and gives users a way to track and understand their workouts. For instance the data provides users with a 'muscle effort' score so they know how much they are pushing themselves. At the same time, heart rate activity is registered so that users can get into the right heart rate zone to improve fitness. VIDEO: The Athos full-body suit that helps track your workouts . The sensors also ensure the users have balance by providing data on whether they are stretching and lifting evenly. University of Waterloo students Dhananja Jayalath and Christopher Wiebe created the suit after being frustrated by their exercise routine. Unable to afford a personal trainer, the electrical engineers put their heads together to come up with a way to get comprehensive data from their muscles as they worked out. Up until now, measuring expended energy had required using small adhesive patches stuck all over the body. The Athos suit, however, has sensors embedded in the compression suit fabric and doesn’t require any adhesives. ‘We've done extensive testing on very sweaty athletes and the sensors perform beautifully,’ said the creators.

Athos has been backed with $3.5 million in seed funding from Chamath Palihapitiya's Social+Capital Partnership. Any piece of Athos clothing will set you back $99 (£60), and you’ll need another $199 (£121) for a core. ‘At launch we're planning to support any iOS device that is running iOS 7 and has Bluetooth 4.0,’ they added. ‘Right now that means we support the iPhone 4s and later, iPad 3 and later, iPod Touch 5, iPad mini.’ The first version, due for launch early next year, will have 14 muscle sensors and one pair for heart rate and breathing.","The Athos suit uses tiny sensors to measure data for up to 14 muscles .

A California police department has received a 37,000 armored truck that was once used in military training exercises. The Salinas Police Department took ownership of the hulking tank-like vehicle on December 17 and parked it in front of the town's Rotunda for public viewing. The $650,000 truck has caused quite a stir in the town, with many residents questioning why a military armored vehicle would be needed in civilian situations. New toy: (left to right) SWAT officers Detective Rivera, Detective McKinley, Sergeant Murray, Chief McMillin and Detective Fors pose in front of the new vehicle . The truck provides protection from handgun and rifle fire as well as explosions. It will be used for the Salinas SWAT team and can transport eight to 10 officers at a time. In a press release, Police chief Kelly McMillin said the department was in desperate need of a replacement for the 1986 Ford money carrier officers used as a rescue vehicle. 'For some time the converted armored car has been in very poor condition; the roof leaks water and the vehicle has been in constant need of mechanical repair.  Due to its low ballistic rating the armored car never truly provided adequate protection,' reads the release. McMillin says the vehicle came to the department free of charge as part of the 1033 program which reallocates government equipment for use by law enforcement agencies. It has never been deployed abroad. A picture posted of the vehicle on the Salinas Police Department's Facebook page garnered varied responses, from enthusiastic support to suspicion. 'That armored vehicle is a disgrace to cops,' wrote one commentator. '...What happened to courage, honor, integrity. That vehicle is made for war. Do not use my safety to justify that vehicle. To better protect me, it's a joke. Come clean and tell the truth. The Salinas Police Department is just a bunch of cowards that want to use that vehicle as intimidation and to terrorize the citizens of this city.' Bigger parking spot: The huge military truck is the newest addition to the police department's fleet of vehicles . Another said, 'The Salinas Police Department shows courage, honor and integrity each day they go out on the streets to protect us. This vehicle will not intimidate any law abiding citizens. If it offends gang members.....GOOD! McMillin says the vehicle, while imposing, will only be used to protect citizens and officers, but some members of the community feel that such a war-like vehicle is unnecessary. 'To stop gang members? Hmmm gang members don't riot in mass numbers. It's right in front of our faces and we don't see it. Why would the ARMY!!! give something like that for FREE!!! Let's think for once people,' said a Facebook commentator. Another agreed: 'And Obama said we don't need military weapons in hands of citizens!' Chief Kelly McMillin responded on the Salinas Police Department's Facebook page. 'I have been reading with great interest the comments of those who feel strongly about this vehicle and the implications it has as regards the policing of Salinas,' he wrote. 'Every man and woman in the Salinas Police Department took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. We take that oath seriously. I thank God we live in a country where we can have this conversation, challenge each other, and challenge the government on how it does its job. Even though I may not agree with all of you, thanks for having a civil discussion.' According to KSBW, the truck's height has already helped the force arrest a dangerous suspect, who was spotted by police running from several blocks away.","The armored truck was given free of charge to the department as part of the 1033 program that reallocates government equipment .

Throughout the years Walt Disney has helped animate some of the . most beloved children’s characters, and during World War II he was enlisted . to help the American war effort by designing a Mickey Mouse gas mask. Fearing a chemical attack from the Germans the United States government distributed over 40 million gas masks to men, women, and children during WWII. However, since adult masks were too heavy and frightening for children to wear, Disney helped to create a mask for kids that looked like his popular cartoon character Mickey Mouse. During WWII Walt Disney helped to design a Mickey Mouse gas mask to protect children against chemical warfare. The mask pictured here is housed in The United States Army Chemical Corps Museum, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri . After the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor . in 1941, Americans feared the threat of the war coming to their own . soil, namely in the form of chemical warfare.

How more and more people are making up memoirs about witnessing Nazi crimes . Amongst the masks made for children was a Walt Disney . designed Mickey Mouse gas mask, to reduce children’s potential fear of wearing . the possibly life-saving mask. The mask which looks like the Mickey Mouse’s face . attached to a branded air filter was designed to fit children aged . 18 months to 4 years old. ‘The mask was designed so children would carry it and wear . it as part of a game,’ Major Robert D. Walk of the US Army Reserve Command wrote . in his essay The Mickey Mouse Mask. ‘This would reduce the fear associated with . wearing a gas mask and hopefully, improve their wear time and, hence, . survivability.’ Disney's Mickey Mouse gas mask was designed to eliminate children's fear of wearing the chemical warfare preventative device . The production of the Disney gas masks began in 1942, a . month after the Japan surprised Americans and attacked Pearl Harbor. The Sun Rubber Company produced approximately 1,000 Mickey . Mouse gas masks with the company’s designer Dietrich Rempel and Disney’s stamp . of approval, Walk notes in his essay. The Sun Rubber Company’s war efforts earned them an . Army-Navy ‘E’ rating for excellence in wartime production in 1944. The protection of children during WWII against chemical . warfare produced efforts to make child-friendly gas masks in other countries as . well. In addition to its child-friendly appearance, the Mickey Mouse mask was designed to fit a smaller head and weighed less than the adult gas mask. Seen here it is being fitted to a dummy . The United Kingdom also manufactured Mickey Mouse gas masks, although . they were not designed to look like the popular cartoon character.

In Germany a child’s gas protective crib was designed to . shield infants against chemical attacks and protective hoods were made for . toddlers and older children who could not fit into the adult-sized masks. As no chemical warfare ever befell the United States, many . of the gas masks were distributed to senior war officials at the end of the war as keepsakes or simply vanished over time, Walk writes. Today the few Disney gas masks that have survived are all . housed in museums across the country including The 45th Infantry Division Museum in .

The son of Ariel Castro, the prime suspect in the abduction of three Cleveland girls, interviewed the mother of one of the missing girls for a local news piece, with no idea she was being held captive at his father's house. Anthony Castro, 31, said he was absolutely stunned when he heard about what his father has been accused of, after Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus, Michele Knight and Amanda's six-year-old daughter were rescued from his home. After the disappearance of Gina DeJesus in April 2004, Anthony Castro penned a piece for his local paper which includded quotes from her mother. He was a journalism student at Bowling . Green State University when he wrote the article, entitled 'Gina . DeJesus’ disappearance has changed her neighborhood', for the Plain . Press in June of that year. Gina's mother Nancy Ruiz told him: 'You can tell the difference. People are watching out for each other’s kids. It’s a shame . that a tragedy had to happen for me to really know my neighbors. 'Bless their hearts, they’ve been great. People are really looking out for my daughter.' Ariel 'Anthony' Castro read out a statement in court in defense of his sister and her mental illness, saying: 'What happened to Janyla was serious, unthinkable and irreversible.

The aspiring journalist described the atmosphere of the area after the incident. 'Since April 2, 2004 , the day . 14-year-old Gina DeJesus was last seen on her way home from Wilbur . Wright Middle School, neighborhood residents have been taken by an . overwhelming need for caution. 'Parents are more strictly enforcing curfews, encouraging their children to walk in groups, or driving them to and from school when they had previously walked alone. 'On Cleveland’s west side, it is difficult to go any length of time without seeing Gina’s picture on telephone poles, in windows, or on cars along the busy streets. 'One thing is for certain, however. Almost everyone feels a connection with the family, and Gina’s disappearance has the whole area talking.' He also mentioned Amanda Berry in his article, saying: 'They feel the disappearance of Amanda Berry on April 21, 2003, was a wake-up call, but Gina’s case really caught everyone’s attention.' Anthony had no idea the answer to her whereabouts, and that of two other local girls, lay in his father's house, which he said he was never allowed inside. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'I . last saw my dad two weeks ago, it was at the house, but he didn't let me . in. 'He never did. I was never invited inside.

Emily Castro, 24, tried to slash her daughter Janyla's throat in April 2007 after she broke up with the child's father. Court documents state that police were called to Emily's home in Fort Wayne, Indiana - where she moved after she became pregnant - when a passerby saw a woman running out to the street with a bleeding baby in her arms. The woman was Emily's mother, Grimilda Figeroa, who told police that her daughter stabbed her own child. When officers went to the home, they found Emily Castro covered in mud, water and blood. She was bleeding from self-inflicted knife wounds to her neck and wrists and told police she tried to kill herself with the same knife she used to attack her baby. She then tried to drown herself in a nearby creek. At the time, she had a long history of mental illness though was found competent to stand trial as it did not meet the legal definition of insanity. During the trial, her defense attorneys produced evidence that Castro suffered from serious depression for years before the birth of her daughter, and that it spiraled into paranoia, causing her to think her family was trying to kill her and the baby at the time of the attack. The Journal Gazette reported at the time of the trial that Emily told the judge she was a good mom and that she did not know how it could have happened.

"By . Keith Gladdis . UPDATED: . 04:08 EST, 27 September 2011 . A prison van was sent almost 100 miles to take a suspect to court because it was claimed that walking him in handcuffs for 60 yards could breach his human rights. Oliver Thomas, 27, accused of public order offences, was due to face magistrates after spending the night in a cell  at the police station next door in  Banbury, Oxfordshire. But to spare him the shame of a 30-second walk in public, the private company which transports prisoners sent a fortified van across three counties to drive him there at an estimated cost of £1,000. A stone's throw: A prison van was sent from 96 miles away to take defendant Oliver Thomas on this 60 yard journey from police station to magistrates' court . This made him late for a separate appearance on an attempted robbery charge at Oxford Crown Court, where Judge Tom Corrie condemned the waste of taxpayer cash. ‘I’m not quite sure why he couldn’t be walked across the street rather than sending a van from Southampton,’ he said. ‘I wonder how much public money has been wasted.’ Suspect: Oliver Thomas was being held at the station over two alleged public order offences . Thomas had been held at the police station after being arrested over two alleged public order offences. GEOAmey, the company responsible for transporting prisoners, is based in Oxford, a few miles from Banbury. However, it claims, its local staff were all busy so it decided to send a van on the two-hour journey from Southampton to avoid walking Thomas between the two buildings and to protect his identity. A spokesman insisted: ‘Police wouldn’t expect us to turn up at Banbury, handcuff a prisoner and take him down the street and to the court. ‘Generally speaking we don’t see that in this country. It strays into the area of human rights. They have a right to have their identity protected.’ GEOAmey is paid more than £90million a year to transport defendants between prisons, police stations and courts on behalf of the Ministry of Justice. Glyn Travis, of the Prison Officers’ Association, said: ‘This is a prime example of how the privatised system is a constant drain on public resources. ‘In the past police would have been able to walk him to the station themselves but now because of the contracts with private companies they are not able to do so. It is wrong for the contractors to think they needed to move a van nearly 100 miles to protect the human rights of the prisoner. ‘It is not unusual to walk prisoners in handcuffs through the streets in situations where the distance is short or there is no access for prison vans. This is another example of where the human rights of offenders is completely disproportionate to reality.’ GEOAmey, which is paid £90million a year to take defendants between custody and courts, had to send a van (similar to the one pictured) across three counties to transport Thomas . GEOAmey boasted it would bring ‘innovation and maximise efficiencies’ when its ten-year contract was awarded in March. Its spokesman added: ‘Our staff collected Mr Thomas from Banbury in the morning and assisted with duties at the court until mid-afternoon, then delivered prisoners to other prisons.’ A police spokesman said: ‘It may be possible for officers to assist with prisoner transport, as we work in partnership with the contractor. ‘However, every situation will need to be decided on its merits.’","Prison van travelled across three counties to take defendant Oliver Thomas on a 30-second journey by foot .

The Prime Minister – who is facing a major Commons rebellion over EU immigration this week – said he ‘shares the frustrations’ of those who want tighter border controls. But he suggested there was little sign of the influx of Romanian and Bulgarian workers predicted by some when transitional controls were lifted at the beginning of this month. ‘Now I think we can see, at the start of the year, so far there looks to be a reasonable level of migration,’ he said. Mr Cameron was later forced to admit his comments were based purely on anecdotal evidence. ‘There aren’t any official statistics,’ he said. ‘I haven’t been looking at any unofficial statistics. But just from what I read and see and hear, as you have, I think that these numbers look, as I said this morning, reasonable.’ Labour accused the Prime Minister of ‘making it up as he goes along’ while rebel Tories said he was guilty of complacency. Mark Reckless, a Tory member of the Commons home affairs committee, said the first official statistics would not be published until May, with more reliable figures not due until October. Mr Reckless, one of dozens of Tory MPs threatening to rebel on the Immigration Bill on Thursday, said: ‘Unless the Prime Minister has been hanging around Victoria Coach Station I don’t know what he is basing his comments on. ‘Even if numbers have been reasonable as he said, the problem is that may knock us off our target in terms of cutting immigration from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands.’ He suggested there was little sign of the influx of Romanian and Bulgarian workers predicted by some when transitional controls were lifted at the beginning of this month .

Douglas Carswell said it was far too early to judge how many people . would come from Romania and Bulgaria to work in industries such as . tourism, construction and agriculture where many jobs are seasonal and . demand increases later in the year.

Tory MPs are threatening to vote for the retrospective introduction of immigration controls on Romania and Bulgaria, despite Government warnings that the move would be illegal under EU law. And former Labour home secretary David Blunkett has joined 100 Tory MPs demanding that foreign criminals should no longer be able to claim they have a right to a ‘family life’ in the UK to avoid deportation. Ministers are promising to tighten the rules using the Immigration Bill, but backbench MPs say the changes would still leave the system open to abuse.","Prime Minister faces down rebels demanding reintroduction of restrictions .

The latest mockup comes after Taiwanese sources say the camera in the iPhone 6 will get a boost to ten megapixels from its current eight, along with a new lens offering better picture quality. It is also expected to boast a new filter allowing clearer pictures. According to MacRumours, the new filter will replace the hybrid IR filter used on the iPhone 5s with a resin lens filter manufactured by Japanese company JSR.

Apple's latest iPhones: The firm is believed to be preparing to release two new large-screen phones in June . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up until August last year, Huawei was the . record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, . at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 7.9mm thick, while the HTC One is 9.3mm. Previous rumours have pointed to a super slim 'iPhone Air' model, which could be the smaller handset. The two new handsets are expected to be revealed at Apple's annual annual developer conference, held in San Francisco in June. It is where the firm traditionally makes new product announcements. If announced, the handsets are expected to go on sale within weeks. Chinese analyst Sun Changxu told Chinese-language website QQ Tech that Apple will launch the follow up to its flagship smartphone in two large screen sizes. According to Sun, the iPhone 6 will come with a 4.7-inch screen, with a display resolution of 1,136 by 640 pixels. The company would then launch a larger 5.7-inch model shortly afterwards. Apple surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin iPad Air, and rumours suggest it could be working on making an equally slender version of its iPhone. Concept images have emerged that show Apple's next-generation handset with a super-thin slender chassis. This concept, by Italian-based firm SET Solution, predicts the handset could be 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom, in order to retain the home button . By comparison, Apple's current iPhone 5S, pictured, has a depth of 7.6mm. This makes it 1.7mm thinner than the iPhone 4S and 1.37mm thinner than the iPhone 5C . Two concept images have emerged that show Apple’s next-generation handset with a slender chassis, as well as a larger 5-inch screen similar to those seen on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One. The first concept predicts the phone - dubbed the 'iPhone Air' - will be 4.5mm thick, while the second goes a step further showing the device as 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom.

In order to make the Apple phone super-thin, Fuse Chicken's concept - dubbed iPhone Air - suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys and swipe controls . Apple surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin iPad Air, pictured, which was 20% thinner than previous models . SET Solution’s concept, instead, keeps the home button by making the bottom of the phone thicker than the top. It also appears taller than Fuse Chicken’s version in order to fit the larger screen. Apple’s iPhone has one of the smallest screens on the market and many experts predicted the screen on the iPhone 5S would be the first to break the 4-inch mark - but it didn't. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has previously said his firm has kept to smaller screens because they’re easier to use and more comfortable to hold in the hand. However, with main rivals Samsung, HTC and Nokia releasing phones with screens in the 5-inch region, analysts claim Apple may have to increase the size of their designs to appeal to more people. Last November, designer Martin Hajek created a concept demonstrating it was possible to increase the iPhone's screen size, without drastically increasing the size of the handset. In his image, the screen is shown as stretched to reach left and right edges. However, because the bezel would need to be a certain size to avoid the screen being touched by accident, when it’s picked up for example, the usable screen size would be much smaller reduced. According to Forbes journalist Anthony Wing Kosner: 'The only way I could see something that thin working for users, is if the material was flexible as well so it could easily slip into a pocket.' He continued that if Apple was capable of making a phone as thin as the concepts suggest, which would also depend on making the components small and thin enough to fit inside the chassis, it could also pave the way for foldable devices.

The number of people dying from unbearable heat in big cities could almost double because of climate change, according to new research. A study in Manhattan found the number of fatalities caused by global warming will far outstrip the reductions in those perishing from the cold. It follows a report last year by the Health Protection Agency that warned heat related deaths in the UK will increase by more than 10,000 annually - a fivefold rise. The study found that heat related deaths in new York could rise by 91 percent in the 2080s . The latest paper used projections from 16 global climate models under two different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios to predict temperature related deaths in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. In one, heat related deaths rose by 91 percent in the 2080s, compared to the annual average of 369 in the Big Apple's most densely populated borough in the 1980s. The decrease of 34.1 percent in the 340 cold related deaths during the same period meant an overall rise in temperature related deaths of 31 percent. Another table based on alternative calculations predicted a 50 percent increase in 'heat' deaths and a 22.1 percent fall in 'cold' deaths, a net rise in 'temperature related deaths' of 15.5 percent. The scenarios also forecast heat deaths will rise by 21.5 percent or 22.2 percent in the 2020s and cold deaths fall by 12.2 percent or 11.1 percent, a 5.3 percent or 6.2 percent increase in temperature related deaths respectively. The HPA fears old people restricted to their homes and patients in hospital will be unable to cope . And in the 2050s heat deaths will rise by 36.9 percent or 49.4 percent and cold deaths fall by 17.3 percent or 21.5 per cent, a net rise in 'temperature' deaths of 10.9 percent or 15.4 percent. The researchers said their findings published in Nature Climate Change highlight the importance of public health risk management in response to global warming. They said rising temperatures in urban areas may lead to increased heat related mortality as well as reduced cold related mortality but until now the overall annual effect has been largely uncertain. The impacts on estimated annual mortality from the different models and scenarios were similar in the 2020s, but began to diverge in the 2050s and differed substantially by the 2080s. The pattern of divergence in mortality mirrors a similar pattern in projected warming. Large increases in the percentage of annual mortality occurred in May and September, when absolute mortality associated with temperature is relatively low at present. The Manhattan based study said that the number of people dying from global warming will be far more than the number who will be saved from the cold . The researchers suggest that adaptation planning strategies for the public health sector may need to consider promoting vigilance outside the traditional high 'heat risk' months between June and August. Professor Patrick Kinney, of Columbia University, New York, said: 'The impact of warming temperatures on population health is of increasing concern to health practitioners and policy makers. 'Urban areas such as New York City are especially vulnerable to temperature extremes owing to the high concentration of susceptible populations, as well as enhancement of temperatures due to the urban heat island effects. 'Temperatures in the New York City region increased by 2 C between 1901 and 2000, substantially exceeding global and US national trends. Preparing for and preventing temperature related health problems has beenidentified as a high priority topic by New York City's government.' The urban 'heat island' phenomenon relates to big cities where buildings and asphalt help capture the sun's light resulting in warmer temperatures. Added Prof Kinney: 'All 32 projections yielded warm season increases and cold season decreases in temperature related mortality, with positive net annual temperature related deaths in allcases. 'Monthly analyses showed the largest percentage increases may occur in May and September. 'These results suggest that, over a range of models and scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions, increases in heat-related mortality could outweigh reductions in cold-related mortality, with shifting seasonal patterns.' At the moment 2,000 people in the UK die every year as a result of heat waves, mostly the old and vulnerable who find it difficult to cool down. But by 2080 the temperature in towns and cities could rise by 10C, peaking at up to 40C (104F) in London, in the summer for several days. People in big cities, such as Hong Kong (pictured), could suffer as a result of rising temperatures . The HPA fears old people restricted to their homes and patients in hospital will be unable to cope. In a report on climate change, the Government Agency predicted almost 12,000 'heat related deaths' by the 2080s, an increase of more than 500 per cent. The problem is even worse if the 'heat island effect' is included. Rising temperatures could also mean that British people may contract exotic illnesses at home as new species of mosquito, that carry tropical diseases such as dengue fever and chikungunya, could migrate to the UK.","A study in Manhattan found the number of deaths will increase by 2100 .

A West Virginia teenager was sentenced to life in prison on Friday after murdering her one-time best friend and leaving her body in woodland. Sheila Eddy pleaded guilty to first-degree murder under a plea agreement that means she will be eligible for parole after 15 years. Eddy and her friend Rachel Shoaf were accused of luring 16-year-old Skylar Neese out of her house in July 2012, before stabbing her to death and hiding her body in a Pennsylvania wood. Jail: Sheila Eddy, pictured in court in October, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of her friend . The 18-year-old from Morgantown was sentenced to life with mercy for the murder. Under the plea agreement a kidnapping charge and two counts of conspiracy were dropped. Shoaf, who pleaded guilty last May to second-degree murder, is awaiting sentencing. Before she was sentenced, Skylar's father, Dave Neese, addressed the court, saying he was 'speaking on behalf of my daughter because she can’t be here'. 'We are no longer a family. You can see the faces of the killer, but you can’t see Skylar’s face. You can’t imagine how Mary and I now feel,' Mr Neese said, according to WV Metro News. 'The person sitting before you, Skylar's so called friend, took her away from us without any remorse or feelings,' Prosecutors said the pair plotted to kill their friend, Skylar, but a motive for the brutal murder has never been revealed. The nearest explanation came from Shoaf, who allegedly told police the girls no longer wanted to be friends with Skylar. Eddy refused to address the court other than to say guilty. Neese's father later said he found her silence 'unacceptable'. Her lawyer said it wasn't a signal of any lack of remorse. Michael Benninger said both Eddy and her family are 'eternally sorry'. according to the observer-reporter. Tribute: Shelia Eddy posted this tribute to Skylar Neese on Twitter before being arrested for her murder . Devastated: Skylar's parents Dave and Mary Neese hold up a photo of their murdered daughter . As Eddy entered the courtroom on Friday, wearing an orange prison suit and with her hair pulled into a pony tail, she looked visibly upset. Her voice broke when she answered 'Guilty' as Judge Russell Clawges asked how she pleaded. Prosecutors claimed Eddy and Shoaf lured Skylar out of her ground-floor bedroom in Star City and drove her to a secluded spot near the unincorporated West Virginia community of Macdale. They said the girls then stabbed her to death at an agreed-upon moment. Authorities said the girls covered the body of the University High honors student with branches when they couldn't bury her, and left it in a wooded area across the Pennsylvania border for months. The break in the case came in January last year, prosecutors said, when Shoaf finally cracked and told investigators what had happened and where to find the body. Prosecutors said they planned to recommend a 20-year prison sentence for Shoaf and will oppose any move to have her sentenced as a juvenile. But she could get as many as 40 years under the law. Speaking at Eddy's sentencing, Skylar's family revealed how their daughter's friend had comforted them and joined in their grief to try and cover her tracks. Skylar's aunt Carol Michaud said: 'She came and acted as if she knew nothing. She pretended and stayed with us and comforted us and swore she had no idea what was going.To come to this day and admit she did just shows how evil she can be.' Confessed: Rachel Shoaf, pictured right with Skylar, admitted to the killing and led police to the victim's body . Though Eddy's name was no secret in the community, authorities didn't make it public until September, when they transferred her case from juvenile to adult court. Skylar was initially considered a runaway and no Amber Alert was issued to publicly notify people of her disappearance. Last year, the Legislature tweaked the state's Amber Alert process that had limited it to cases where a child is believed to be abducted. The revised law requires law enforcement to relay initial reports of any missing child to state police, regardless if the person is a runaway. Amber Alert personnel would then decide whether or not to issue an alert.","Sheila Eddy, 18, admits murdering Skylar Neese in July 2012 .

On Saturday, a year to the day after the deadly attack, the happy couple got married in a small church just 3 miles from the cinema where they had nearly perished. Han, 21, and Davis, 22, were among the 58 injured in the shooting that left a dozen dead. Friends who also survived the rampage took part in the ceremony at Village East Baptist Church in Aurora as senior pastor Robert McClendon prayed for the couple and for those still grieving. United: Aurora shooting survivors, and now newlyweds, Eugene and Kirstin Han smile at each other after exchanging vows during their wedding ceremony at Village East Baptist Church, in Aurora, Colo.

Reclaim the date: The happy couple chose July 20 as their wedding day in a bid to transform a tragic anniversary into a day of celebration . ‘This time is both happy and sacred,’ McClendon said. The visibly emotional bride entered the church Saturday afternoon on the arm of her father, Darrell, who walked her down the aisle, decorated with tulle and turquoise ribbons, wearing a black cowboy hat. At the altar, the blushing bride was met by her groom, who opted for a classic black suit paired with a white vest and tie. A boutonniere of white and blue flowers pinned to his lapel completed Han’s wedding day look. Kirstin Davis appeared radiant in her A-line, dropped-waistline satin gown with a sweetheart bodice heavily embellished with crystals and a full skirt with cascading pickups and a large brooch sparkling in the back. Photos taken during the ceremony show the emotional and elated couple exchanging vows and sealing their union with a kiss, flanked by their wedding party and family.

Making memories:  Kirstin's coworker Alanis Dymes takes a picture of herself and the newlywed, who is all smiles . One of Davis' bridesmaids, attired in a turquoise halter dress, also survived the massacre, along with two of Han’s groomsmen. Han and Davis’ journey that brought them to this joyous day started on South Padre Island on the last day of an April vacation. As the sun rose over the beach Eugene asked Kirstin if she would be his wife - and she said yes. He followed with another idea: They should be married on July 20, 2013. ‘It took me a second. I didn't understand where he was coming from,’ Davis said. Their wedding would take place a year to the day that they went to the Century 16 theater. That night, the couple, who had been dating for two years, had settled into the second row near the aisle alongside three friends, among them Adan Avila and Luke Priest, to watch the premiere of the thriller The Dark Knight Rises. Intimate moment: Kirstin and Eugene perform the ceremonial first dance during their wedding reception, in Denver . All the single ladies: Kirstin prepares to throw her bouquet during the wedding reception for her and her husband Eugene Han . Han, sleepy from a 12-hour shift at a medical supply business, spotted someone dressed all in black entering through an exit door near the screen. He saw that two guns were strapped to the intruder's body, and he dropped from his seat and pulled Davis to the floor: . ‘All I was thinking was, if anything, I could put myself between her and the bullets,’ he recalled. Both were injured. He was shot at close range in his hip and leg and had to undergo several surgeries. Davis had bullet fragments in her back. His friend Adan Avila also was shot in the leg, which had to be amputated, the Los Angeles Times reported. Han spent five days at a hospital and the next three months bedridden, his parents and brother tending to him. A year later, his right leg is marked by purplish, coin-size scars. About a month after the shootings, . Davis started a job as a teaching assistant at an elementary school. Then came the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Conn., . which ‘sent me over the edge.’ She eventually quit her job. These . days, she is sleeping better, but she fears big crowds. Someday, the . 22-year-old Davis sees herself once again working with children. Healing: A year later, Han's right leg is marked by purplish, coin-size scars. Believers: They credited their spiritual faith with allowing them to find forgiveness for the gunman . Haunted: Kirstin is sleeping better now, but she fears big crowds . Han, 21, wants to return to college, write a book - and let the shooter know he forgives him. Han explained prior to the ceremony that the idea behind their decision to tie the knot on July 20 was to make it a happy day, at least for them. ‘Someone has to be the first person to take the first step to make it a better day,’ Han said. In January, Han and Davis visited the newly remodel Century 16 multiplex along with other shooting victims. Han and his parents walked inside what used to be theater 9 and sat in the second row, thinking about their lucky escape. Davis walked right out the room, and the couple have not returned to that cinema since. The childhood friends met in church in the fourth grade and began dating three years ago. On the night of the shooting, Han, Davis and three friends decided to attend the midnight showing of the new Batman movie. Survivors: Eugene Han and Kirstin Davis have been together for three years . Han, 21, and Davis, 22, were among the 58 . people wounded when alleged shooter James Holmes opened fire 18 minutes . into the screening of the new Batman film on July 20, 2012. Han was shot in the knee and hip in the attack, and Davis suffered scratches after her boyfriend pushed her to safety. Mr Han said he thought he was going to be killed as soon as the shooting began. He still has bullet fragments inside his body. Holmes is charged with 166 counts of murder and attempted murder, . and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Holmes's lawyers say he . wants to plead not guilty by reason of insanity. If the judge accepts the new plea, . Holmes would be sent to the state mental hospital, where doctors would . determine whether he was insane at the time of the July 20 shootings. Holmes was 24 when he carried out his . attack in the packed movie theater. He had recently dropped out of his . PhD in neuroscience at the University of Colorado in Denver and had been . seeing a university psychologist. Witnesses . said that about 20 minutes into the film a man wearing a gas mask and . bullet-proof vest walked into the theater and started firing into the . crowd. Devoted: Kristin visited Eugene in hospital every day after the attack, in which he was shot twice . As the audience . tried to run for cover, the gunman was said to have continued to fire . calmly into the crowd with an assault rifle, handgun and shotgun. His youngest victim was six-year-old Veronica Moser, whose 25-year-old mother was seriously injured in the shooting. The former student had also allegedly left explosive devices at his home . The childhood friends have vowed to not let the attack, which killed 12 people, ruin their future lives together. Mr Han told Denver Channel: 'Most days I remember it like it was yesterday. Why not make it a better day?' 'We were talking about that word ""anniversary"". Honestly, I don't think it should be used for the theater . shooting. It's not a good day,' Mr Han told the station.

Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured arriving at BBC Television Centre for the Andrew Marr Show, says he will cease benefits to 40,000 children who live in other European Union countries . Millions of pounds in child benefit paid to families living outside the UK will be axed under David Cameron’s plan to claw back powers from Brussels. The Prime Minister insisted it was wrong that the British taxpayer is giving cash to 40,000 children who live elsewhere in the European Union. He revealed stopping migrant workers in the UK from claiming child benefit for their offspring back home would be a key demand of his plans to renegotiate a fresh deal with the EU before staging an in-out referendum by 2017. Under EU rules, the benefit has to be paid to European nationals who are working in Britain and paying National Insurance – even if their families are based abroad. Here are around 24,000 families claiming for 40,000 children, with two-thirds of the children based in Poland. Mr Cameron said: ‘I don’t think that is right and that is something I want to change.’ He warned stopping the export of benefits across the EU would ‘take time’ because a deal would need to be struck with other member states or wait for the new treaty he hopes to negotiate if he is still Prime Minister after the next election. He told BBC1’s Andrew Marr show: ‘There are other European countries who like me think it’s wrong that someone from Poland who comes here, who works hard - and I am absolutely all in favour of that - but I don’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in Poland. ‘Now, to change that, you’ve either got to change it with other European countries at the moment, or potentially change it through the treaty change that I’ll be putting in place before the referendum we will hold on Britain’s membership of the EU by the end of 2017.’ Child benefit is paid at £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for every other child. Since last year families in the UK with one person earning more than £50,000 have had their child benefit cut, and removed altogether if one earner has a salary of more than £60,000. Mr Cameron made clear that tackling immigration from Europe would also be a key demand of renegotiation talks. Scroll down for video .

Crackdown: Cameron said he wants to stop people getting paid less than the minimum wage . ‘My job is to put in place proper controls so people can’t come here to claim benefits; to put in proper controls to investigate that people aren’t being paid less than the minimum wage; to make sure we deal with illegal immigrants; to make sure if people can’t sustain themselves, they are removed from our country. All those steps we’ll be taking.’ He said he wanted to change Britain’s relationship with the EU before putting it to a vote in an in-out referendum.

He refused to say if he would campaign to leave the EU if he failed to secure enough concessions, insisting his renegotiation was ‘doable’. ‘We need flexibility, we need more competitiveness, we need less costs added to our small business, we need to fix all these things.’ But the PM came under fresh pressure to explain why he had not published a forecast for the number of Romanians and Bulgarians who will arrive this year after work restrictions were lifted. ‘We are not making a forecast because I think it is unlikely we would get that forecast right,’ the Prime Minister said. But he defended moves to charge foreign nationals to use A&E departments on the NHS, denying it was to bureaucratic to be enforced. He said: ‘We should do it. We can do it. Our NHS is a national treasure, we can all be incredibly proud of it and it’s right that we all pay into it and everyone here has access to it for free. ‘But people who come to our country, who don’t have the right to use it, should be charged for it, and we’re putting that in place.’ Passengers by a bus departing for western Europe at the central bus station in Sofia, Bulgaria a few days ago. Mr Cameron made clear that tackling immigration from Europe would also be a key demand of renegotiation talks . Mr Cameron's tough stance on EU immigration is seen as a response to the growing popularity of the UK Independence Party, which predicts it will win elections to the European Parliament in May. UKIP leader Nigel Farage dismissed the Prime Minister's announcements as rhetoric designed to echo his own policies. He wrote on Twitter: David Cameron seems to be trying to sound like me.

Banned: Female genital mutilation was criminalised 28 years ago but there has never been a UK trial . Britain's first trial for female genital mutilation is expected to take place within weeks, following a concerted campaign to bring the brutal practice to an end. Despite the procedure being criminalised 28 years ago, the case of an unidentified adult woman who was mutilated twice will be the first female genital mutilation trial to be heard in a UK court. Experts warned that future prosecutions were being hampered however, as doctors, teachers and social workers are systematically failing to report cases of genital mutilation to the police. According to the latest research, more than 65,000 girls in the UK are at risk of female genital mutilation. However there were only 93 reported cases in the UK last year - 69 to the Metropolitan Police and 24 to West Midlands Police. This is despite an estimated 70 girls, some as young as seven, seeking treatment every month. Speaking to The Times, Detective Superintendent Jason Ashwood, head of a Scotland Yard team specialising in female genital mutilation cases, said: 'I can hardly think of an example of a doctor calling up to say 'I have someone with me in A&E, please can you call an officer'. That just does not happen'. 'It's clear when professionals are seeing people who are survivors or at risk of FGM, it's not being referred to the police, What we need to do is get out people in the public sector to fulfill their safeguarding responsibilities,' he added. Mr Ashwood went on to say: 'It is child abuse. Police are just at the end of the line of the process. You can only react to what you find and what you are told.' Pain: A nine-year-old girl winces in pain after undergoing female genital mutilation (file image) News of the case coming to court comes as the Crown Prosecution Service revealed it is investigating further 10 cases in London alone after establishing a network of specialist prosecutors in each region of the country. Of the 10 cases being investigated in London, four relate to incidents where a decision had previously been taken not to prosecute, three are at an 'early advice' stage, and another three are entirely new cases. Later today misisters prosecutors and law officers will meet to mark Female Genital Mutilation Day and outline the next steps in tackling the crime.","Case involves an adult woman who has been mutilated more than once .

Patients trying to access the NHS Choices website have been bombarded with advertisements and malware after a coding error. Although the NHS says the problem is now fixed, there are fears that thousands of people may have already had their computers infected by viruses, potentially compromising their personal information. The problems were first spotted over the weekend, with thousands of users subsequently taking to social networks to complain about malware-infested pages and links to irrelevant advertisements. Writing on Reddit, a user going by the name Muzzers wrote: 'While attempting to access flu shot information I stumbled on a page which redirected me to an advert. Digging a bit deeper I found hundreds more pages which redirect either to an advert or to malware-infested pages.' In total around 800 pages are believed to have been affected, although site administrators insist the problem was not caused by hackers. A spokeswoman for the Health and Social Care Information Centre, which runs the NHS website, said the problems were caused by a misplaced letter 's' at the coding stage, with a developer accidentally typing googleaspis.com instead or googleapis.com. The spelling error initially had little or no effect for visitors to the NHS Choices website, but on Sunday the incorrect web address was registered as a new website in the Czech Republic. Patients were then redirected to the Czech version of the website, which had been loaded with adverts and malware. Internet security expert Graham Cluey said the NHS' explanation was unusual but added that if it turned out to be factually accurate, then anybody who inadvertently downloaded malware could be at risk . Speaking to the Independent, internet security expert Graham Cluey said the explanation was unusual but added that if it turned out to be factually accurate, then anybody who inadvertently downloaded malware could be at risk. Mr Cluey said: 'I'm surprised by that explanation... what often happens is that a hacker will find a weak point and inject a piece of code to exploit it and set up a domain name. Otherwise whoever registered the domain name in the Czech Republic must have scanned the code, which few do, or registered numerous websites in the hope of getting lucky.' In a statement the Health and Social Care Information Centre said: 'An internal coding error has caused an incorrect redirect on some pages on NHS Choices since Sunday evening. Routine security checks alerted us to the problem on Monday morning at which point we identified the problem and corrected the code.'

A mental competency hearing broke out in chaos Friday afternoon as a man screamed out at the mother of a missing 5-year-old in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. 'Where's my nephew? What happened to my nephew?' Sandrino Oliver screamed at Elsa Oliver, whose son Jeremiah was last seen in September. The Boston Globe reports that Sandrino Oliver resisted as he was brought out of the courtroom by both officers and his own relatives. Heartbreaking: Sandrino Oliver (center) shouted out in the court room during Elsa Oliver's psychological wellness hearing, where she was determined to be mentally fit to stand trial . Unusual behavior: The attorney representing Elsa Oliver, seen here in court today, said that he has not been able to communicate with her in spite of hours spent together since her December arrest . After freeing himself from the group, Mr Oliver 'began to weep'. The heartbreaking tale has been months in the making, as Jeremiah was reported missing in December when his sister told someone at her school that she and her siblings were being abused. The girl said that the last time they saw Jeremiah- which is said to be on September 14- his hand was bleeding and for unexplained reasons, his mother Elsa was reportedly worried that he would die as a result of the hand wound. Elsa Oliver and her boyfriend Alberto Sierra, 22, were first brought into court in December. Oliver, 28, was out on bail since December as she was waiting for the psychological evaluation to determine if she was mentally fit to stand trial. The court appearance that erupted into a screaming match today was dedicated to that evaluation, and Judge Margaret Guzman ruled that she was mentally sound, in spite of her lawyers assertions to the contrary. Both Elsa Oliver and Alberto Sierra face multiple charges, including assault with a dangerous . weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two . counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and . battery with a dangerous weapon. Gone missing: Jeremiah hasn't been seen since September . and his sister told school authorities in December that when she last . saw him, his hand was bleeding and their mother feared he would die from . the wound . James Reardon Jr., her attorney, told the Boston Globe that he has spent hours with her but she is incapable of coherently communicating with him. The missing boy's biological father, Jose Oliver, said that while he is estranged from his wife, he does believe that she is still competent and thinks that- if allowed- he could have a conversation with her in a meeting to try to get some clues out of her. He reportedly said that Elsa had spoken with his sister-in-law and said little and showed no emotion for her missing son. At one point, she interjected asking: 'Is it the Rapture?' Emotionless: She reportedly spoke to a relative recently and randomly interjected asking 'Is it the Rapture?' The main suspects: Elsa Oliver (right), 28, and . Alberto Sierra (left), 22, have been charged with multiple counts . related to the young boy's disappearance . Another concerning clue came during the initial investigation, when the found that Elsa has a tattoo with a butterfly and the date 'Sept. 25, 2013' written below it. Police have spoken to local tattoo artists because they want to know whether she told a tattoo artist why that date is significant. It is not clear why it took three months for authorities to be notified of Jeremiah's disappearance, but an anonymous tip led them to believe that the mother's boyfriend may have had something to do with the alleged abuse. The source said Sierra, 22, would bully and intimidate those around him, routinely becoming irate and even making death threats on more than one occasion.

The violence in Kiev has taken a new turn as protesters are turning on each other following government plans on amnesty for the demonstrators. The Ukranian parliament have been discussing a 'Get Out of Jail'-free card, on the premise that demonstrators vacate the government buildings they have occupied during the violent protests in the past weeks. This saw Svoboda party, which represents more moderate protesters, clashing with members of the more militant Spilna Spravam, as the former tried to get them to vacate the Agriculture Ministry in Kiev today.

Do you hear the people sing? Protesters guard the barricades in front of riot police in Kiev on Wednesday . The scenes followed an announcement by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday that Russia would wait until a new government is formed before it considers releasing a crucial £9billion bailout package for Ukraine. The Russian president's comments indicated that Moscow may renege on its promise to bail out the crisis-hit country if the new government turns out to be staunchly anti-Russian. ‘Let's wait until a new government is formed in Ukraine,’ Putin said in televised remarks to his cabinet. ‘But I ask you not to lose contact with your colleagues even in the current situation.’ Violent demonstrations have raged in the capital of Kiev and across the country since President Viktor Yanukovych pulled out of a key EU deal in favour of closer ties with Moscow and have escalated in response to anti-protesting laws. Earlier, a Ukranian MP was pictured in a bullet-proof vest during a parliamentary session yesterday as the country’s Prime Minister and cabinet resigned in the wake of recent turbulence. Opposition deputy Lesya Orobyets wore the flak vest on Tuesday, which saw the resignation of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and a repelling of the anti-demonstration laws, as a sign of protest against police firing at demonstrators.

Silent protest: As prime minister Azarov resigned, Lesya Orobyets wore the flak vest as a sign of protest against police firing at demonstrators in Ukraine . Yesterday president Viktor Yanukovych wrote on the parliament’s website that he ‘accepts the resignation of Mykola Azarov and as a consequence the resignation of the entire Ukrainian government.’ Lesya Orobyets is the deputy leader of opposition party Batkivshchya, headed by Yulia Tymoshenko, which is demanding early elections despite Azarov's resignation and the end of the repressive anti-protesting laws. Today, Ukraine's parliament will vote on a measure offering amnesty to people arrested during the protests that have gripped the country. However, it has been indicated that the amnesty will with a condition, and will only be offered if demonstrators clear the streets and leave the buildings they have seized. The condition is likely to get the cold shoulder from protesters, who want to push demands for the president's resignation and early elections. Giving up: Ukraine's prim minister Mykola Azarov submitted his resignation this morning amid continuing political protests in the capital Kiev . Handing in their notice: Both the prime minister and the cabinet resigned yesterday during a special session of parliament which scrapped the anti-protest laws which sparked violence across the country . The wide-spread protests began in late November after President Yanukovych shelved a long-awaited agreement to deepen ties with the European Union, but they have been increasingly gripped by people seeking more radical action, even as moderate opposition leaders have pleaded for the violence to end. About half of Ukraine's people favoured deeper integration with the EU, according to polls, and many Ukrainians widely resent Russia's long influence over the country. In the past week, demonstrators have seized government administration buildings in a score of cities in western Ukraine, where Yanukovych's support is weak and desire for European ties is strong. A crowd late Saturday besieged a building, throwing fireworks, firebombs and rocks, near the protest tent camp where about 200 police were sheltering. By early Sunday morning, a corridor was created, allowing police to leave. It is not known if the amnesty has led to an end of the occupation. Violent demonstrations have spread across Ukraine since the anti-protesting laws and anti EU moves came into force in November last year .

Hotel hopper: Billionaire business tycoon Nicolas Berggruen, pictured with designer Lindsey Steede last year, has chosen not to own a house because he's 'not interested' in material possessions . Like most nomads, Nicolas Berggruen travels light. He doesn't own a house, car or even a watch and the few belongings he does have are carried around in a paper bag. Possessions have 'zero appeal', he says. It's our actions that have real value. But what sets the 50-year-old apart from nearly all other homeless people is the small matter of his £1.5billion fortune. Berggruen got rid of his New York pad and private island 12 years ago. Home is far more transient nowadays. Life for him is a jet-set one - trotting the globe, hanging out with beautiful women and staying in luxury hotels, sometimes in 14 different cities in a month as he builds his enormous business empire. His most recent acquisition has been a £881million stake in Burger King. But in spite of his wealth, the Franco-German tycoon insists he doesn't need, or want, material goods. 'Possessing things is not interesting,' he told the Daily Mirror. 'Living in grand environments to show myself and others that I have wealth has zero appeal. 'Whatever I own is temporary, since we're only here for a short period of time. It's our actions that will last for ever. That's real value.' Berggruen was born into a privileged family (his Jewish father, Heinz, was a wealthy art dealer who befriended Pablo Picasso) in Paris in 1961. He had a rebellious streak when growing up - getting expelled for 'insubordination' from a Swiss boarding school and once vowing he wouldn't learn 'a word of English' because it was the language of imperialism. He did, however, move away from that view and went on to study finance at university in New York. Playboy: The 50-year-old often hangs out with beautiful women like Claudia Schiffer (left) on his jet-set travels . Happier now: Berggruen, posing with actress Lisa Lovbrand in 2009, says he prefers living like a nomad . In 1988, he jointly founded hedge fund Alpha Investment Management and later created Berggruen Holdings, which bought slices of firms around the world. One of these was German department store Karstadt, which he acquired for one euro and then saved 25,000 jobs there by investing £40million. He's never revealed why, but in 2000 he had something of an epiphany and vowed to give away most of his wealth. In that year, he sold his Fifth Avenue home in New York - and his private island off Miami - and focused instead on his hotel-hopping travels, staying at some of the world's finest establishments such as Claridge's in London. Mingling with the rich and famous, he . holds an annual Oscars party at Los Angeles Chateau Marmont hotel, where . he hosts celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Paris Hilton.

Celebrity friends: Berggruen holds an annual Oscars party at Los Angeles Chateau Marmont hotel (above) for stars such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Paris Hilton . He told the Daily Mirror: 'I have always spent a lot of time in hotels, so it started to seem easier to do this. I feel happier. 'I am not that attached to material things. I have very few possessions. Luckily, as a man, you don't need much.' Berggruen is one of more than 50 billionaires who have agreed to give away at least half of their fortunes. He spends millions buying artworks by Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst just to hand them to museums for free. And last year he spent £12million on a campaign to save California from its crippling debts. Perhaps a homeless charity will be next on his list.","Nicolas Berggruen, 50, has £1.5billion fortune... but plans to give half away .

You might not be able to match his sublime tennis skills but you can now replicate the look of number one player Novak Djokovic. His sponsors Uniqlo are selling replicas of his kit online and in their High Street stores. And you don't need to have a salary like the tennis ace in order to afford it as prices start at £7.90 for a pair of socks or £29.90 for a polo shirt. Uniqlo have designed different kits for each of the grand slams the Serbian star has played in the last year. Each of the outfits is tailored to the traditions of the tournament or to reflect the values or flag of the country he's competing in. Dress like a champ: Novak Djokovic's kit is on sale on the High Street . Wimbledon whites: You might not be able to play like Djokovic but now you can look like him, shorts and T-shirt £29.90 each . For example, according to Uniqlo, his kit for January's Australian Open - where he won the title against Andy Murray - featured green stripes 'to highlight awareness for ecological and environmental causes.' The Japanese brand reveal how Djokovic has a creative influence over the kit he wears as 'the initial design featured stripes all over the T-shirt, but as per Djokovic's request, they were just used on the sleeves.' As he takes to centre court at Wimbledon today on his quest to win another grand slam, he will of course have to adhere to the rule of the tournament of wearing white. But the brand's website states that their design director Naoki Takizawa 'opted for a classic white to emphasise Novak's strong physique'. The kit includes some subtle colouring with a line of brown stitching on one side and the red Uniqlo logo. Traditional: Djokovic models his 'classic white' kit on centre court today . Fashion conscious: The green on the Serbian's Australian Open kit, left, was used to 'highlight awareness for ecological and environmental causes' while the colour of his French Open polo shirt, right, was chosen so he would stand out against the clay . Replicas of the white polo shirt with a zip and matching shorts can be purchased for £29.90 each. When the player was able to wear a colourful kit at last month's French Open, he opted for a light green shade that the brand stated was chosen to make him stand out against the red clay of the Roland Garros courts. They add it was 'also specifically chosen to represent Djokovic's 'strength and energy - as well as his passion for the French Open.' Djokovic, who is the 5/4 favourite to lift the men's singles trophy at Wimbledon, will play world number 34 Florian Mayer in his first round match this afternoon. Grand slam catwalk: The website of the Japanese brand explains the different design choices . Sponsorship deals have helped tennis players become some of the world's most wealthiest sports players. Djokovic became a brand ambassador for Uniqlo in May 2012, leaving his previous clothing sponsor, Sergio Tacchini International, because he said he had 'outgrown' their brand. The Uniqlo collections of his grand slam kits were launched in the stores last month. The company state that the player had a personal input throughout the design process as 'Takizawa worked extremely closely with Djokovic to develop tennis apparel that matches his uncompromising standards of performance excellence.' The collections that are on sale include replica's of the kit he competes in as well as his warm up gear and off court casual wear. Sports brand Nike have been keen to snap up the world's top players from Roger Federer and Rafal Nadal to Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova. But to ensure the players maintain their own individuality and don't appear to be wearing a uniform, they have created distinctive styles and logos for each player. The sale of replica kit and novelty T-shirts is also a clever marketing ploy so tennis fans can declare if they're 'Team Nadal' or 'Team Federer' etc by their choice of clothing. Individuality: Spain's Rafael Nadal's logo is of a Spanish bull but the T-shit made in his honour, right, turned out to be too true given he won at the French Open on clay but crashed out on Wimbledon's grass in the first round . Personal: The quirky T-shirt Federer warmed up in yesterday is on sale for £20 .

The document, which is being sold by a private owner in Israel and is only available . for local pick up, is the only copy of the list ever to be sold on the open market. Remarkable: Schindler's list contains the names of about 800 Jews that were saved by German businessman Oskar Schindler -- Scroll down for the complete list . Calling the document ‘a piece of history that has inspired many,’ the listing . by auction promoters Eric Garvin and Gary Zimet guarantees the list’s authenticity – it was sourced . from Itzhak Stern, Schindler’s accountant played by Ben Kingsley in the . award-winning film. The document can only be collected in Israel 'for security' and to give the . winning bidder the opportunity to personally inspect it, Garvin told MailOnline . Garvin and Zimet are collectors from California with a history of headline-grabbing auctions through their company Auction Cause and are hoping for the document to sell for millions beyond the reserve price. The two chose ‘the . world’s marketplace’ because there are billionaires and . wealthy celebrities using the site. Garvin told the New York Post. The two collectors hope to earn at least $5 million . from when the auction ends after 10 days, he added. ‘Using . eBay offers the widest audience and the most opportunity to bid, as . opposed to a traditional auction house,’ Garvin added in comments to . MailOnline. For sale: Collectors have put an original copy of 'Schindler's List' up for auction on eBay .

They made it into a movie: Actors Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley on the set of Schindler's List . Doomed: Prisoners at the Buchenwald concentration camp, one of many across Europe responsible for the near-extermination of European Jews by the Nazi regime . Explaining that he understands why people believe the list belongs on display in a museum instead of for sale online, Garvin said that many people with collections of ‘fantastic items’ choose to share those items with a greater audience. ‘It would not surprise me if it ends up in a museum… I think that would be fantastic,’ said Garvin. The list originated from German . Industrialist Oskar Schindler. During World War II, Schindler made it . his mission to keep his Jewish employees from oppression and death at . the hands of the Nazis. Schindler even bribed officials with cash and lavish gifts to keep them away.

A former 'teacher of the year' accused of having sex with a student when he was 12 denied the allegations today and told the court the 230 pages of racy texts they exchanged were part of 'sexual therapy' she was using to help him. Married mother Ethel Anderson, 30, from Riverside, Florida, is accused of having a three-month sexual relationship with the boy when she was supposed to be tutoring him. The alleged victim, now 14, who has not been named, testified today that the alleged abuse started four or five weeks into their tutoring sessions when she would kiss him and perform oral sex on him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Married mother: Ethel Anderson, 30, from Riverside, Florida, is accused of having a three-month sexual relationship with a student when she was supposed to be tutoring him . Emotions: Anderson wept in court as her alleged victim talked about how he loved her like a girlfriend during their three-month affair . He told the court: 'I felt like she was a girlfriend, I loved her and she said that I was her boyfriend and she loved me. She would rub on my legs, kiss on my ears, neck and stuff like that...We would tongue kiss.' Anderson faces nine felony counts of lewd and lascivious molestation and turned down a 15-year prison deal followed by 15 years of probation . Anderson, who worked as a language arts teacher at Mango Elementary School, cried as she listened to the teen's testimony and denied the charges when she took the stand. When confronted about the 230 pages of racy text messages she said they were just sexual therapy that she was using on the 'troubled student' to motivate him. She told the court: 'At the time, with him struggling with school and having behavioral issues and anger issues, acting out at home and not being able to connect with his family, the way that he and his parents felt, that was my purpose. To gain his attention and, yes, I did it in an inappropriate way.' The mother-of-one claims the boy would threaten her, telling her things like, 'keep playing you're gonna lose your child'. The boy also told the court that he did not want to lose his virginity to a teacher and would tell her to stop, but she persisted because she 'wanted him so bad', ABC reports. The parents of the young boy were suspicious of their son's close relationship to the Anderson and tipped off police. Wearing a wire, the boy's mother later confronted Anderson, when she admitted having oral sex with him. The tape was played to the jury. Accolade: In 2011, Anderson was named as Teacher Of The Year at Mango Elementary School in Florida, where she was a language arts teacher . In her testimony, Anderson testified she only admitted to sex acts in the secretly recorded confession by the boy's mother, only because that is what she thought the mother wanted to hear. Anderson faces nine felony counts of lewd and lascivious molestation. The 30-year-old turned down a 15-year prison deal followed by 15 years of probation. The jury of three men and three women will now decide her fate. She faces up to 30 years in jail.","Married mother-of-one Ethel Anderson, 30, is accused of having three-month relationship with student .

Britain and the US has suspended all non-lethal aid to rebel fighters in northern Syria after Islamist fighters seized Western-backed rebel weapons warehouses, highlighting fears that supplies could end up in the wrong hands. The news comes as a winter storm is sweeping through the area where millions of Syrian refugees live in rudimentary tent camps. Storm Alexa has brought high winds and freezing temperatures to areas where displaced Syrians are already struggling to survive. Humanitarian crisis: A Syrian man carried a child through the snow during a winter storm in a refugee camp in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley . The rebel Free Syrian Army fighting President Bashar al-Assad said the US and British moves were rushed and mistaken. FSA spokesman Louay Meqdad said: 'We hope our friends will rethink and wait for a few days when things will be clearer.' The suspension underlines a crisis for the FSA leadership which needs international backing to reinforce its credibility and to stop its fighters joining powerful al Qaeda-backed Islamist militants who now dominate the war with Assad. The US and Britain have in the past offered radios, body armour, medical supplies, money and food to rebels fighting Assad. But a U.S. embassy spokesman in Turkey declined to give details of what supplies may have been halted. Fighters from the Islamic Front, which groups six major rebel brigades and which said last week it had quit the FSA, seized the headquarters of the Syrian Military Council, nominally in charge of the FSA, and weapons warehouses at the Bab al-Hawa crossing on Syria's northwestern border with Turkey. Caught in the cold: A Syrian refugee works outside his tent during a winter storm in Zahle town, in the Bekaa Valley where some of the millions of displaced and refugees from the war in Syria live . The worst is yet to come: A storm named Alexa is sweeping across Syria and Lebanon, bringing with it high winds and freezing temperatures . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based anti-Assad monitoring group, said the Islamic Front had seized dozens of 'Shilka' anti-aircraft weapons and anti-tank rockets from the SMC arms stores in fighting on Friday and Saturday. The Islamic Front's battlefield success in capturing the weapons stores could undermine SMC assurances to the United States that no supplies sent to their fighters would fall into the hands of Islamist brigades. The U.S. embassy spokesman in Ankara said the situation was being investigated 'to inventory the status of U.S. equipment and supplies provided to the SMC'. 'As a result of this situation the United States has suspended all further deliveries of non-lethal assistance into northern Syria,' the spokesman said. Five rebel fighters were killed in the clashes at Bab al-Hawa but it was not clear which side they were on. Surviving the cold: A woman is carrying bread and water in the tented settlement in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, home to more than a thousand people . Little shelter: Two Syrian refugee children run for cover from the snow in Zahle . Doing their best: A family sit close together inside their tent to keep warm in the winter storm . American aid, including trucks, ambulances and food, reaches Syria overland through Turkey. U.S. officials said in the summer that they had developed a system of . distribution using SMC operatives that would ensure the aid reached . U.S.-allied groups. A senior U.S. administration official said that the suspension should not be misinterpreted. He . said: 'This is absolutely not the beginning of the U.S. washing its . hands. We will remain engaged in the humanitarian effort, we will remain . engaged in the diplomatic effort. 'This doesn't represent a change in policy in our support for the moderate opposition.' He . said the administration was looking for other ways to see how the . support can be provided to ensure it does not fall into the hands of . extremists. The British wanted the situation clarified after the clashes. The violent struggle between Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces and rebel troops has raged since 2011 . A spokesman for the British embassy in . Ankara, said: 'We have no plans to deliver any equipment while the . situation remains so unclear. We will keep this under close review.' Turkey . shut its side of the border crossing in Hatay province, customs sources . told Reuters, citing a reported increase in clashes on the Syrian side. There was no immediate confirmation from Turkish officials. Wednesday's . announcement does not affect humanitarian support because this is . distributed through aid groups and the United Nations. The first U.N. relief airlift to Syria . from neighbouring Iraq will deliver food and winter supplies to the . mostly Kurdish north-east over the next 10 days. The . conflict which has raged since 2011 has killed more than 100,000 . people, driven more than two million abroad as refugees and left many . millions more dependent on aid. Playing . down the fighting between the Islamic Front and the FSA brigades as a . 'misunderstanding', the FSA's Meqdad said SMC leader General Salim . Idriss was talking to the front's leaders to try to resolve the . confrontation. The rebel Free Syrian Army fighting President Bashar al-Assad said the US and British moves were rushed and mistaken . Asked whether any FSA stock was missing Meqdad said: 'Everything will be clear in the next hours and we believe the Syrians are good people and we don't believe there was a problem. They are our brothers.' Infighting among Syrian rebels has weakened their efforts to bring down Assad in a conflict which began with peaceful protests against his rule in March 2011 and has descended into civil war. The British Embassy spokesman added; 'I want to underline that our support to the opposition remains undiminished. 'We have been long-standing and strong supporters of General Idriss and the SMC. That remains the case. 'It is important that the SMC remains united in the face of attacks from the regime and from extremist groups. 'Otherwise . this will be a setback for all Syrians who support a political solution . and a democratic, pluralist future for their country.' Infighting among Syrian rebels has weakened their efforts to bring down Assad in a conflict which began with peaceful protests against his rule in March 2011 and has descended into civil war . Assad's army, backed by Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group and Iraqi Shi'ite fighters, has made steady gains around Damascus and to the north of the capital, while rebel territory in the north has seen increasing cases of inter-rebel conflict. Many activists who helped to organise protests against Assad have now fled abroad from rebel-held territory, fearing not Assad's security forces but hard-line Islamists they say are equally intolerant of dissent. Prominent human rights lawyer Razan Zaitouneh was kidnapped in the rebel town of Douma, activists said on Tuesday. They said it was not clear who had seized the 36-year-old activist who has documented human rights violations in Syria. The family of two Spanish journalists said yesterday they have been held since September by fighters linked to al Qaeda. Fifty-five journalists have been killed and 30 are still missing in Syria, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, making the country the most dangerous place in the world for media workers.","Free Syrian Army group says that the US and UK move is 'rushed and mistaken'

But a spoof advert for the vacant England manager’s job has been taken down today after attracting 100 excited but now disappointed applicants. The joke ad, posted on a major recruitment website, said people should only apply if they have the calibre to 'succeed in a major international tournament' and can 'beat Germany.' In a nod to bookies' favourite and Spurs boss Harry Redknapp's recent aquittal for alleged tax evasion, it said the new manager would have 'exemplary tax histories' and needed to be 'currently occupying a top 3 Premier League position.' But now it has had to be taken down after . other clients advertising on prweek.com complained their jobs might . also be seen as a joke. It was viewed a staggering 25 times more than any other vacancy on the site after it was placed on Thursday night but was taken down within 24 hours. Joke: The advert, pictured, was placed online and a flurry of excited football fans applied for the job . The 'rare opportunity' was described as based at Wembley with some international travel but candidates must be able to be at home in the public eye and cope with heckling in the street. It alluded that England's new manager must also solve the age-old problem of playing Liverpool's Steven Gerrard and Chelsea's Frank Lampard in the same team. A perk of the job is that the successful applicant would get free travel for themselves and also their wag, it said. It read: 'Understanding the beautiful game from grass roots level upwards, you should be the type of person who thrives under pressure and is totally at home in the public eye, whether this is at an official interview or street heckling.

But despite the fun, the company said the advert had to go. Gone: Fabio Capello quit as England Manager this week just four months before Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine . Jess Wain, Senior Sales Executive, said: 'We had a complaint from another one of our clients. 'We thought that was a fair enough complaint and we are a professional business so we took it down. It was good while it lasted.” Richard Hamilton, manager director of Guru who posted the fake ad said they received applications from a spoof Sven-Goran Eriksson, David Pleat, and the real-life favourite Harry Redknapp. He said: 'People have included their management history from computer game Football Manager their applications to prove why they have the experience for the job.' On Wednesday Redknapp and his chairman at Portsmouth Milan Mandaric, 73, were cleared of all charges of tax evasion by a trial jury at Southwark Crown Court, London. Later the same day England manager Fabio Capello, 65, handed in his resignation to the FA, following showdown talks over comments he made to the Italian media in relation to John Terry’s suspension as captain of the national side. The FA chose to remove Terry, 31, from the position when the CPS announced he would not face trial for a racially aggravated public order offence, until after the European Championships being held in Poland and the Ukraine this summer. Terry is accused of using racially offence language towards QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, 26, during Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat at Loftus Road on October 23. THE ADVERT IN FULL: .

'Undesirable' and 'dangerous' immigrants who have committed serious crimes in Britain cannot be deported if they face 'ill-treatment' at home because it is against their human rights. European judges ruled today that regardless of how bad their crimes are, the convicts can never be sent back. Today in the landmark decision, two Somalis - Abdisamad Adow Sufi and Abdiaziz Ibrahim Elmi - won their appeal against deportation. The panel of seven judges at the European Court of Human Rights (pictured) ruled two Somali criminals could not be sent back . There are now fears that up to 200 more . criminals could be allowed to stay by declaring they will be tortured if . sent back to their country of origin. Strasbourg judges ruled that the two Somalis could not be sent back to Mogadishu - despite serious convictions. Both Sufi and Elmi have convictions for a number of serious offences. In the case of Elmi, 42, it is . robbery and supplying class A drugs cocaine and heroin and in that of . Sufi, 24, it is burglary and threats to kill. The European Court of Human Rights also awarded Sufi and Elmi, both currently in UK immigration detention centres, £12,500 and £6,700 respectively for costs and expenses in bringing the case. Sufi, 24, claimed asylum in the UK in 2003 on the grounds that he belonged to a minority clan persecuted by Somali militia. His account was rejected as not credible and asylum was refused. Elmi, 42, arrived in the UK in 1988 and was granted leave to stay as a refugee in 1989, renewed indefinitely in 1993. Their UK appeals that they risked being ill-treated or killed if returned to Mogadishu were rejected. The European Court of Human Rights blocked their deportation pending a hearing of their appeals to the Strasbourg court. Violence fears: UK appeals by the Somalis who claimed they would face the risk of harm if sent back to Mogadishu were rejected. However, the court overturned that ruling. (File picture) Today the seven-judge court ruled unanimously that deporting them would breach the Human Rights Convention Article 3 which bans 'inhuman or degrading treatment'. The ruling said: 'The court reiterated that the prohibition of torture and of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is absolute, irrespective of the victims' conduct. 'Consequently, the applicants' behaviour, however undesirable or dangerous, could not be taken into account.' The judges said no one disputed that, towards the end of 2008, Mogadishu was not a safe place to live for the majority of its citizens. The situation had deteriorated since then. The ruling cited the UK's own Asylum and Immigration Tribunal which acknowledged the dangers, while saying it was possible that individuals with connections to powerful people in Mogadishu might be able to live there safely. Anyone else being returned would face a real risk of persecution or serious harm, although those whose home area was in any part of southern and central Somalia might be able to go back in safety and without undue hardship. Human Rights Watch described the situation in Mogadishu as 'one of the world's worst human rights catastrophes'. The judges concluded that the general level of violence in Mogadishu 'was of sufficient intensity to pose a real risk of treatment in breach of Article 3 to anyone in the capital'. The judgment described the case as the 'lead case' against the UK, with 214 similar cases pending before the same court.","More than 200 foreign criminals could now be granted right to stay following test case .

Pilots rely so heavily on computer systems in today's airliners that when things go wrong they are unprepared to take control, according to aviation safety experts . The National Transportation Safety . Board will hold a two-day investigative hearing later this month on the Asiana Airlines jet crash that was flying too low and slow while . trying to land at San Francisco International Airport in July. The plane struck a seawall just short . of the runway, shearing off its tail and sending the rest of the . airliner sliding and turning down the runway before breaking apart and . catching fire. An aerial view of an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 plane is seen after it crashed while landing at San Francisco International Airport in California in July . Three passengers were killed and scores of others injured. The hearing on December 10 and 11 will focus on 'pilot awareness in a highly automated aircraft,' the board said. Increasing automation has contributed to historically low accident rates in many parts of the world. But automation has changed the relationship between pilots and planes, presenting new challenges. Pilots today typically use their 'stick and rudder' flying skills only for brief minutes or even seconds during takeoffs and landings. The plane struck a seawall just short of the runway, shearing off its tail and sending the rest of the airliner sliding and turning down the runway before breaking apart and catching fire . Mostly, they manage computer systems that can fly planes more precisely and use less fuel than a human pilot can. But humans simply aren't wired to pay close and continual attention to systems that rarely fail or do something unexpected. 'Once you see you're not needed, you tune out,' said Michael Barr, a former Air Force pilot and accident investigator who teaches aviation safety at the University of Southern California. 'As long as everything goes OK, we're along for the ride. We're a piece of luggage.' Ye Mengyuan, left, and Wang Linjia, right, are two of the three Chinese students killed the crash landing . Experts carrying out the investigation into the Asiana Airlines jet incident want to know how the three seasoned pilots allowed a passenger jet with no apparent mechanical problems in near-perfect weather conditions to lose speed so dramatically that it was on the brink of stalling moments before the crash. The pilot flying the plane was attempting to land without use of the autopilot. Normally, the pilot in the second seat is supposed to have his eyes on the plane's computer screens to monitor airspeed and other readings, rather than looking out the window. In this case, that pilot was a training captain who was grading the performance of the pilot flying the plane. The training captain told investigators he thought the plane's autothrottle was maintaining engine power and thus speed, but discovered that wasn't the case just moments before the crash. The autothrottle was 'armed,' or made ready for activation, investigators said in briefings after the accident, but they left open the question whether it was engaged and in idle or another mode. Aircraft systems can have many modes, or settings, and perform quite differently depending upon the mode. Pilot 'mode awareness' is one of the more common automation-related problems showing up in accidents and incidents, according to an automation study released last month by the Federal Aviation Administration. Mode changes occur frequently during flight, often without any direct action by pilots. If pilots aren't continually paying close attention, they can lose track of which mode their systems are in. Investigation: The wrecked Flight 214 on the runway at San Francisco airport . Pilots also make mistakes when selecting modes. Mode selection errors were cited in 27 per cent of the accidents reviewed in the FAA study. Less than six weeks after the Asiana crash, a United Parcel Service cargo jet flying too low while trying to land in Birmingham, Alabama, struck trees and then a power line before crashing into a hillside near the airport. Both pilots were killed. In that case the autopilot was on and seconds before the crash there was a loud automated warning that the plane was losing altitude too rapidly, according to investigators. The investigation is continuing, but some safety experts see a possible link between the two accidents. 'I think mode awareness is going to be very central in both investigations,' said John Cox, an aviation safety consultant and former accident investigator for the Air Line Pilots Association. 'In both cases the airplane appears to have been properly maintained, everybody is properly trained. A lot of the focus is on how the crew operated the airplane so that it ended up with the airplane short of the runway.' The Asiana accident was the first fatal crash of a passenger airline in the U.S. since a regional airline pilot lost control of his plane during a landing approach in Buffalo, N.Y., in February 2009. In that crash, investigators found the two pilots weren't closely monitoring airspeed and failed to notice when the speed began dropping rapidly. An Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 is pictured after crashed landing in San Francisco, California, in July . The first officer also made a programming error at the start of the flight that much later caused the plane's automated stall warning system to go off even though the plane wasn't on the verge of stalling. The startled captain responded to the warning, and again to another automated safety system, sending the plane into a full stall. It plummeted to the ground, killing all 49 people on board and a man in a house below. There was nothing mechanically wrong with the plane and the captain should have been able to regain control of the plane if he had responded correctly, investigators said. Such 'loss of control' accidents accounted for 43 per cent of fatal passenger airline and air cargo accidents over the five years ending in December 2012, according to the International Air Transport Association, which represents carriers around the world. Safety experts believe pilots are becoming so reliant on computer systems in today's airliners that on the rare occasions when something goes wrong they are unprepared to take control . Last month, the FAA issued new pilot training regulations calling for more attention to teaching pilots how to recover from stalls. The regulations are a response to the regional airline crash and to a pattern of accidents and incidents around the world in which startled pilots faced with situations automation can't resolve fail to appropriately take charge. 'Flight crews are seemingly becoming increasingly reluctant to revert to manual flying when automated systems fail, when aircraft attitudes reach unusual positions, or when airspeeds are not within the appropriate range,' the air transport association said in an annual safety report this year. 'Flight crews must still be capable of manually operating the aircraft, especially in edge-of-the-envelope situations.' The issue is a sensitive one for the airline industry. Dan Elwell, senior vice president for safety at the trade association Airlines for America, said he doesn't believe pilots' relationship with aircraft automation is a growing safety problem. 'Pilots today are as proficient as ever. We're not seeing any degradation in stick-and-rudder skills,' he said. Dome experts foresee an increasing level of automation in planes and in systems used by air traffic controllers to direct planes. The precision that automation provides will be needed if planes are to safely fly closer together and to direct them more efficiently in and out of airports to accommodate greater demand for air travel, said Hank Krakowski, a former head of FAA air traffic operations. 'There are limits to how well a human can do that, particularly with more airplanes coming in,' he said. 'So you really do need automation to help manage that.'","Asiana Airlines crash hearing will take place on December 11 .

Dating scams where vulnerable people looking for love have been ripped off has helped fraud surge by 27 per cent in the past year, crime figures released today have revealed. Experts have warned that more criminals are using websites to spark romances with strangers and then ask them for money. The racket has developed along with fake online auctions where web-users attempt to buy products online but are never sent their goods. Some 229,000 frauds were recorded in the last year - up by 27 per cent on the 181,000 of the previous period, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. It came as it was revealed that overall crime has fallen to its lowest level for 32 years despite there being 4,500 fewer police officers. Down: Official figures show that crime is down nine per cent in the past year, reaching the lowest level since records began . Manipulative: Figures show frauds online, either involving dating or never sending goods, are on the rise . Online dating scams . accounted for 1,212 of the frauds reported, while bogus internet . auctions made up around 23,000 of the offences. The rise in fraud has been partially attributed to a change in the way data is collected. Victims are now encouraged to report crimes to Action Fraud, which acts . as a central point of contact for help with financially-motivated . internet crime, rather than visiting a local police station. John Flatley, of the ONS, said: 'The figures are showing that this is a new area of crime that is on the rise. 'It is difficult to determine how much that is due to an increase in the . prevalence of crime or an increase in publicity for Action Fraud.' Rape and other sexual offences have gone up because more victims have come forward following the Jimmy Savile scandal,  according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Experts have called the 'Yewtree . effect' - in reference to the Scotland Yard investigation launched after . the paedophile DJ's decades of abuse were revealed after his death. Overall there were nine per cent fewer crimes in the year to March when compared to the previous 12 months. This drop to the lowest level since records began in 1981, came despite deep cuts to police budgets and rank and file numbers, official figures show. Most likely: This graph shows the most prevalent types of crimes committed in the 12 months to March 2013 . But the number of reported rapes has . risen by two per cent in the past year, with the increase thought to be . linked to the knock-on effect of the Jimmy Savile investigation. Fraud has also soared by 27 per cent . though overall crime is down by 9 per cent on last year - the lowest . level since the Crime Survey for England and Wales began in 1981, the . Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. In March there were 129,584 full-time police offices, 4,516 less than a year earlier. Facts: Five in every 100 adults were victims and 14% of all households also suffered crimes . The data was released as the body representing rank and file officers warned forces would be unable to cope with a repeat of the 2011 riots as a result of Government austerity measures. An additional one million offences - which are not included in the police figures - were dealt with by the courts in the year ending December 2012, the ONS said. These cover less serious crimes such as speeding offences. Shame: Figures show that a significant number of households are victims of vandalism, theft and burglary . Picture: Similar number have also been been victims of violent crime . The ONS identified decreases across all the main categories of victim-based crime compared with the previous year, except for theft from the person, which went up nine per cent, and sexual offences which rose by 1 per overall, with a 2 per cent increase in rapes. This has been attributed to the police inquiry into historic sex attacks launched in the wake of the Savile scandal. 'The latter increase is thought to be partly a ""Yewtree effect"" whereby greater numbers of victims of sexual offences have come forward to report historical offences to the police,' the ONS said.","More criminals starting relationships online then ask them for cash .

Families face being 'clobbered' by a rise in interest rates, it was warned today as unemployment fell to within a whisker of the target set by the Bank of England. A record number of people found work in the three months to November, as the economic recovery builds a head of steam. It means the unemployment rate fell sharply to 7.1 per cent, just above the 7 per cent target set by Bank governor Mark Carney when he could consider putting up interest rates. The unemployment rate fell sharply to 7.1%, putting it within a whisker of the 7% target set by the Bank of England when it could consider putting up interest rates . Surprise figures today show an extra . 280,000 people had a job in the last three months - the largest . quarterly increase since records began in the 1970s. In a huge boost for George Osborne's economic plan, there is now a record 30.15 million people in work. It comes after the International Monetary Fund said Britain would grow faster than any other European country. Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter: 'The biggest quarterly increase in employment on record. More jobs means more security, peace of mind and opportunity for the British people.' In the Commons today he said cuts in public . spending meant the Government was able to offer voters tax cuts, which . when they were taken in to account meant people were better off than in . 2010. Mr Cameron told Labour leader Ed Miliband: 'We are cutting taxes for everyone in this country and we are only able to do that because we have controlled spending. What you cannot face is the fact that the economy is improving. 'The fact is today our plan is working. There are 1.3 million more people in work in our country. That is 1.3 million more people with the security of a pay packet. We are securing Britain's future and it would be put at risk by Labour.' But Mr Miliband claimed many voters were facing a cost of living crisis as inflation continued to rise at a faster rate than wages. A delighted David Cameron said the record number of new jobs was proof the government's economic plan is working . Of the 280,000 new jobs created from September to November, 220,000 were full-time - reversing a trend where many people were forced to take part-time work. There was a fall in the number of people working part-time because they could not find full-time jobs - down by 12,000 to 1.4 million. The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance in December fell by 24,000 to 1.25 million, the lowest figure for almost five years. However the biggest shock was the fall in the unemployment rate, down from 7.4 per cent in August-October to 7.1 per cent. An extra 280,000 jobs were created in September-November, the largest quarterly increase since records began in the 1970s . Young people should be prepared to . take lowly jobs in coffee shops if they want to get on in life, the . employment minister has said. Esther . McVey said jobseekers need reminding that they have to start at the . bottom and work their way up, rather than expecting to walk into their . dream job. In an interview . with the Mail, she admitted that young Britons are less prepared for the . world of work than foreign migrants and need to learn the basics, such . as turning up on time. But she insisted that those who want . to work hard can succeed if they are prepared to learn the ropes and ‘be . realistic’ about their abilities. Asked . if they should be prepared to take ‘entry-level jobs’, she said: . ‘Absolutely. You could be working at Costa. But in a couple of years’ time you might say, “I’d like to manage the area” or might even want to . run a hotel in Dubai.’ Bank of England governor Mark Carney had said that unemployment would have to reach 7 per cent before he would consider putting up interest rates. It had been expected by the end of 2016 but it now seems almost certain to happen in the first half of this year. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady . said: 'It's encouraging to see another big fall in unemployment, . particularly amongst young people who until now haven't benefited from . rising job levels. 'But . while headline unemployment is within a whisker of the Bank's forward . guidance threshold, an early interest rate rise would clobber . mortgage-holders and businesses - jeopardising our economic recovery.' Mr Carney has in recent weeks rowed back from the idea of a sudden increase in interest rates, which could trigger a sharp rise in mortgage bills for families still not enjoying the benefits of the recovery. In an attempt to quell fears of a sudden . rate rise, minutes of the Bank’s meeting released today showed members of the nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) 'see no . immediate need to raise rates' regardless of the plunging unemployment rate. New figures today also show wages are up just 0.9 per cent, while the CPI rate of inflation tracking the rise in living costs is at 2.1 per cent. Employment minister Esther McVey said: 'Creating jobs and getting people into employment are central to our economic plan to build a stronger, more competitive economy, so it is very encouraging news that we’ve seen a record-breaking rise in employment over the last three months – the largest ever. 'With the highest quarterly fall in unemployment since 1997, it’s clear that the Government’s long-term economic plan to get people off benefits and into work so they can secure their future is proving successful.' Labour's shadow work and pensions . secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'Today’s fall in overall unemployment is . welcome. The Government should use this opportunity to tackle the . unacceptably high levels of long-term unemployment and youth . unemployment. 'More than 900,000 young people are unemployed and over 250,000 young people are long-term unemployed. The . Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) has said it will not . lift interest rates above their historically-low level of 0.5 per cent . until the unemployment rate drops to 7 per cent. Bank of England governor Mark Carney will come under pressure to make clear if interest rights will rise this year as TUC leader Frances O'Grady warned a rise would 'clobber' families . Analysts had not expected the threshold to be reached until later in the year, although the Bank has since stressed a figure of  7 per cent will not automatically trigger an interest rate rise. Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said: 'It's now inevitable that unemployment will soon fall below the Bank of England's forward guidance rate of 7 per cent. 'However, the weakness of pay growth suggests there is still a considerable amount of slack in the labour market which for the time being remains an inflation free zone. Better news on jobs is no reason for an early rise in UK interest rates.'","Extra 280,000 jobs in three months to November, biggest rise on record .

Now Socks the dancing Shetland pony and star of one of the most popular adverts of the year, has another mark of celebrity to add to the list: notches on his bedpost – and a paternity test to match. Socks, who did a Michael Jackson-style moonwalk in the advert for mobile phone network Three, was put out to stud with three mares. Scroll down for video . Mover and shaker: Socks the Shetland pony shot to fame after moonwalking in an advert for Three . But he took a shine to another lady called Kimberley who was intended for another stallion. This didn’t stop him however, and he swum across a loch in his native Shetland to get better acquainted. Last month a black colt called Scamp was born. But the owners of the Benston Stud in Voe, have ordered DNA tests on the mainland to establish the identity of the father. If conclusive, Scamp could be the first foal Socks has fathered since he shot to fame. Another foal sired by Socks and her mother died soon after giving birth last month. Two years ago he fathered his first and only foal, a filly called Quartz, who has the same markings. Socks’s owner Mari Williamson said: ‘He most definitely has a real eye for the ladies. He doesn’t need any encouragement. ‘I put him with three ladies in a . field with a loch. But he is a very good swimmer and unfortunately he . took a shine to another one of my mares who I had put in a group with my . other stallion Nuggett. ‘He . just fancied her more and thought the grass is always greener on the . other side. Socks swam across – with his three ladies in tow – and now . we don’t know for sure who is Scamp’s real father. ‘Socks . was put in stables for two weeks after. It is costing an arm and a leg . for the DNA tests but it is important to keep the line correct.’ Mum: Shetland Kimberley was due to mate with a different stallion but may have been seduced by Socks . Baby: Little Scamp is at the centre of a paternity battle with DNA tests being carried out to see if Socks is his father . The other man: Socks's love rival Nuggett was due to mate with Kimberley in the hope of producing a foal . If Scamp is Socks’s son, he will command an extra premium and will be sold. Mrs Williamson said Scamp is already showing signs of being Socks’s heir. She said: ‘Scamp is a real character – cheeky and very friendly. He is a very good colt. I’m chuffed to bits with him.’ Socks’s commercial, which sees him ‘moonwalking’ on a cliff in the Shetlands to Everywhere by Fleetwood Mac, has been viewed more than 5.3million times on Youtube. He was even given VIP treatment during filming in the shape of his own hairdresser who fitted extensions and pampered him with luxury beauty products. And he was prepared for his starring role by local animal trainer Elaine Tait, who taught him to do the moonwalk by teaching him to paw with his hoof and rewarding him with carrots. The advert was filmed by award-winning filmmaker Dougal Wilson, famed for his festive adverts for John Lewis.

'She was the pet I had with my mum, Evelyn, when I was young. She was a little ball of white fluff and I fell in love with her straight away. She quickly became my best friend. 'I call her my ‘fur baby’ because she really does feel like one of my babies. To me, she’s my ‘firstborn’ and as she gets older, I find myself spoiling her even more.'

Leanne's dog Salon, Mucky Pups in Cardiff. Lucy benefits greatly from her owner's booming business - by getting pampered each and every week . Mrs Couch said: 'I don’t like it when children are spoiled. I want my children to know the value of things so I don’t feel guilty for not buying them whatever they want whenever they want. 'Lucy is another matter entirely - she’s a dog and buying things for her doesn’t change her personality. 'I spend a few hundred pounds on Lucy every month - if I see something new that she doesn’t already have, I have to get to get it for her. It’s mainly designer clothes which cut into my budget - as soon as a designer item hits the shelves I buy it for her. 'The children have never questioned it because they see Lucy as part of the family. Leigh loves Lucy too, so he goes along with whatever I want to buy her.' At Christmas, Lucy has double the amount spent on her compared to the children. She usually receives a brand new bed, a new wardrobe of designer clothes and a full spa day. Whereas Mrs Couch’s children have around £200 spent on them each at Christmas, Lucy receives £400 worth of presents. Lucy, the 12-year-old Maltese, models some very stylish pink leopard print ear warmers in her Princess Lucy personalized bed, which cost £400 . Every week Lucy is pampered all over - she has her fur dyed pretty colours, massages and a facial, and is always dressed to impress . The family pet has a life of luxury - from a £400 personalised wooden bed with a leopard print interior, to a wardrobe bursting with hundreds of designer clothes, leads and harnesses totalling thousands of pounds. The dog has a designer collar costing £300, a £110 necklace which she wears on special occasions, and is pampered from nose to tail every single week. She also only eats speciality dog food from feeding bowls embossed with her name. Mr and Mrs Couch work an exhausting 90-hour week between them to fund Lucy’s lavish lifestyle, and Mrs Couch says she has sacrificed personal treats too. She said: 'I don’t get my nails done anymore, and fake tans and blow drys are a thing of the past. But that’s how I choose to spend my money. Mr and Mrs Couch work an exhausting 90-hour week between them to fund Lucy's lavish lifestyle which includes £400 worth of presents each Christmas . 'We both work ridiculously long hours to keep both our businesses afloat - Leigh is a heating and gas engineer and often works more than 50 hours a week. 'I also have another job - I’m a retention consultant at the Royal College of Nursing. I don’t even take a wage from the dog salon - I spend it all on Lucy. 'Since opening the salon, life has been pretty hectic and we haven’t had a family holiday this year. But cutting back on the things we buy for Lucy is not really an option.” Mrs Couch claims her desire to have a daughter also played a big part in how she treats Lucy. She said: 'I love my boys dearly but for years I yearned for a little girl - someone to dress up in pink and spoil. 'I found myself buying all the little pampering treats and pretty clothes for Lucy which I would probably want to buy for a little girl. Leanne's dog salon has designer clothes imported from America and has a wide range of pamper treatments on offer for the dogs . 'Now that Livie is with us I am buying girly clothes for her - but I don’t think I will stop spoiling Lucy anytime soon. Livie is far too young to appreciate her outfits anyway.' Mrs Couch’s Cardiff salon - ‘Mucky Pups’, the first of its kind in Wales - opened its doors last year. Lavishly decorated in pink and black, with plenty of sparkly accessories and fixtures, the salon is the ideal place for dog owners who want their precious pets to look like a million dollars. In the boutique part of the shop are rows of designer clothes, harnesses, carry-bags and even doggy pushchairs. 'Lucy was the inspiration behind Mucky Pups,' said Mrs Couch. 'I recognised there were probably thousands of other women who love to pamper their pets too. Leanne says that despite the birth of her daughter Livie, she won't stop spoiling Lucy . 'We get designer clothes imported from America and we have a wide range of pamper treatments on offer for the dogs. We recognise that dogs rarely like to be groomed and some find it a frightening experience. The spa is about making the whole thing more relaxing and enjoyable for them. 'If the dogs are happy, the owners are happy, and that’s what is all about. And Lucy benefits greatly from her owner’s booming business - by getting pampered each and every week. Mrs Couch said: 'Every week she is pampered all over - she has her fur dyed pretty colours, massages and a facial, and is always dressed to impress. People are often bowled over by how good she looks. 'I don’t want anyone to judge Lucy for looking scruffy - as the owner of a pampering parlour that would reflect badly on me too. 'She is mollycoddled a bit - we never leave her on her own and everywhere she goes she has a bag full of treats and clothes to wear in case she gets cold.

Archivists at the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington DC were going through a backlog of artifacts this week when they came across an unexpected treasure: a wooden box filled with 150 original glass plate photos from the Spanish-American War. ‘The plates were individually wrapped in tissue paper and include full captions and dates, which were likely prepared by the photographer, Douglas White,’ said Lisa Crunk, NHHC's photo archives branch head. The large container fitted with a leather shoulder strap came with an etching on the cover explaining that it contains photographic slides of U.S. naval military activities in and around Manila, Philippines, during the Spanish-American War of 1898, which were made by war correspondent Douglas White. Incredible find: David Colamaria, Naval History and Heritage Command's photographic section archivist, looking at a glass plate photograph of Spanish Adm. Pasqual Cervera taken in 1898 or 1899 . Hidden treasure: This image of U.S. soldiers manning a battle signal corps station was among some 150 glass plate photos discovered in a wooden box in a storage space at the Washington Naval Yards . The archivists at NHHC did some digging and discovered that White was a reporter and photographer at the San Francisco Examiner, then owned by controversial publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst. Crunk noted that the collection of rare images, which had been hidden from public view for over a century, is significant because the Navy played a pivotal role in every aspect of the conflict between the U.S. and Spain, which played out over ten weeks of fighting in the Caribbean and the Pacific. ‘American planners and leaders anticipated that the fight with Spain would be primarily a naval war,’ she said. ‘The U.S. Navy's victories at Manila Bay and Santiago de Cuba were pivotal events that turned the course of the war and joint Army-Navy operations at Santiago, Puerto Rico, and Manila sealed the success won by the U.S. Navy's command of the seas.’ On April 25, 1898, the U.S. declared war on Spain following the sinking of the Battleship Maine in Havana harbor on February 15 of that year. The conflict was fueled by newspaper magnates Joseph Pulitzer and Hearst, the owner of the Examiner – widely regarded as the fathers of 'yellow journalism# - who used sensationalistic headlines and exaggerated accounts of 'atrocities' committed by the Spanish in Cuba to sway public opinion in favor of the war. Provenance: The uncovered images, among them this undated photo of American troops disembarking from an unknown ship onto small boats near Cavite, Philippines, were likely taken by San Francisco Examiner special war correspondent Douglas White . Theater of war: This image provided by the U.S. Navy shows the burning of San Roque, Philippines, February 9, 1899 - more than a month after the signing of the Treaty of Paris that put an end to the conflict . Aftermath of carnage: This photo depicts damage to Fort San Antonio Abad in Manila caused by eight-inch shells from the U.S. Navy cruiser Olympia ( . The armed conflict, which ended on the ground in August, was officially concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Paris December 10, 1898, establishing the independence of Cuba, and ceded Puerto Rico and Guam to the United States. As the victor in the war, the U.S. also was allowed to buy the Philippines Islands from Spain for $20million. The war had cost the U.S. $250million and 3,000 lives, of whom 90 per cent had died from infectious diseases, according to information from the Library of Congress. The cache of 116-year-old glass plates showing scenes from the various theaters of war was uncovered in an archival storage space at the Washington Naval Yard as staffers Dave Colamaria and Jon Roscoethe were laying the groundwork for a major upgrade of their collection. Fanning the flames of war: William Randolph Hearst's San Francisco Examiner used sensationalistic headlines and exaggerated stories to sway public opinion in favor of the war . Boots on the ground: The U.S. paid dearly in blood and treasure for its ultimately successful involvement in the Spanish-American War, which claimed 3,000 lives, 90 per cent of whom had died from diseases . Victory: Soldiers receiving the news of surrender of Santiago, Cuba in 1898 . Old-time heroes: 'Teddy's colts,' at the top of the hill which they captured in the battle of San Juan Hill in Cuba during the Spanish American War . 'The images are an amazing find, though they were never really lost - they were simply waiting to be re-discovered,’ Crunk said. Among the black-and-white photos shot by White in 1898 is one showing American troops disembarking from a ship onto small boats near Cavite, Philippines. Another undated glass plate depicts the burning of San Roque, Philippines, during the conflict, while a third shows damage to Fort San Antonio Abad in Manila caused by eight-inch shells from the U.S. Navy cruiser Olympia. As part of NHHC's planned overhaul, all the images in their possession would be digitized in high resolution, catalogued and uploaded onto the organization’s website for easy access.

The mother of a San Francisco-based freelance writer has received a credit card offer in the mail, ostensibly addressed to her daughter, but with one significant difference. The Bank of America sent an offer to one 'Lisa Is A Slut McIntire' for a $100 cash-back bonus if she signed up for a Bank Americard Cash Rewards Visa credit card. Her bemused mother, who chose a much more conventional middle name for her daughter, sent a text message to McIntire, telling her, 'Interesting piece of junk mail addressed to you. ""Lisa is a slut McIntire.""' Hate mail: Lisa McIntire's rudely addressed mail offered a special credit card deal to 'Lisa Is A Slut McIntire' Her daughter was understandably confused. 'Uh, what?' she responded. McIntire tweeted a picture of the offensive envelope to the Bank of America Help account and received a response around 5:30pm Thursday saying that the bank is looking into the insulting piece of advertising. 'We’re incredibly sorry this happened and are researching now so we can take the appropriate action,' the bank's account tweeted at her. Those of us who have never been insulted by an envelope may be horrified at the slight, but Lisa McIntire is taking it as a blessing in disguise. Mad mail: Lisa McIntire's mother texted her about the offensive letter . Indecent proposal: Lisa Is A Slut McIntire has earned a special offer, according to the letter . 'February 6, 2014: the day my personal brand finally hit it big!' she tweeted, adding that her mother couldn't be prouder. McIntire says she racked her brains to think if there was anyone she had inadvertantly offended at the Bank of America who could be reponsible for the gaffe. 'Not that I know of!' she told New York Magazines' Daily Intelligencer. She said the letter had 'initially made me nervous because I'm a feminist writer on the internet, but I don’t think it's personal.' McIntire's Twitter followers speculated on how the letter came to be addressed in such as fashion. 'Some poor data-entry clerk had a really rough break-up with his girlfriend Lisa (the slut),' suggested one. Investigating: Bank of America has told McIntire that staff are looking into how the envelope came to be addressed in such a way . Another told McIntire that despite the aspersions cast upon her character by the bank, he is impressed with her fiscal management. 'Are you single? Your creditworthiness, among other things, is a turn on,' he tweeted. Another mail-out error recently saw a grieving father, whose daughter was killed in a car accident, receive a letter from Office Max addressed to 'Mike Seay, Daughter Killed in Car Crash.' The devastated father was disturbed not just by the envelope but the fact that the company would possess personal information about him. ‘What purpose does it serve anybody to know that?

This terrifying collection of  shotguns, knives and samurai swords was discovered in the boot of a car carrying six British jihadists who plotted to kill and maim hundreds of people. A nail bomb packed with 458 pieces of shrapnel and parts for a pipe bomb were also found. The gang had evaded the security services and their car  was only searched after being impounded because the driver did not have insurance. Scroll down for video of the arrests and the EDL rally . Plotters: Jewell Uddin, who was also linked to another terror plot, and Anzal Hussain who today admitted planning the attack on the EDL rally in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, in June last year . Guilty: Mohammed Hasseen, left, and Omar Khan who today admitted their role at Woolwich Crown COurt . Court: Zohaib Ahmed and Mohammed Saud were also involved in the plot which only unravelled by chance . The terrorists plotted to detonate a bomb at an English Defence League rally, which would have caused hundreds of casualties, including police officers, bystanders and members of the far-Right protest group. The terrorists now face lengthy jail sentences after admitting the plot – a protest against the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee – at Woolwich Crown Court yesterday. The court heard that the men drove from Birmingham on June 30 last year to set off the bomb at the rally in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. However, the meeting had finished early and by the time they arrived everyone had dispersed. On the way back, the gang’s Renault Laguna was stopped by a policeman in a random spot-check on the M1. He impounded the car after discovering it was uninsured. It later emerged that one of the terrorists had tried to insure it, but entered the wrong registration number on an online form. The car was taken to a pound near Sheffield where it sat for two days until a worker found the weapons and ten copies of a note addressed to the Queen, David Cameron and ‘the enemies of Islam’. Nail bomb: This 18-inch long device contains 458 pieces of shrapnel and was to be powered by explosives taken from at least two large fireworks . Explosive: Ball bearings and nails which were found inside the nail bomb when it was taken apart by police ballistics experts . Cache of weapons: A fearsome haul of knives which were found hidden inside the Laguna after it was pulled over because it had no insurance . It called the Queen a ‘female devil’ and accused her of ‘fooling a nation of blind sheep’. To the EDL, it said: ‘We love death more than you love life.’ Staff at the pound called the police, who called in counter- terrorism teams. The next morning, Omar Khan phoned to ask if he could pick up the car and he and passenger Jewel Uddin were arrested, along with Mohammed Hasseen, who had not been in the car but whose fingerprints were found on the weapons. Pipe bomb: These are parts of a partially put together pipe bomb which was seized by police . Other passengers Anzal Hussain, Zohaib Ahmed and Mohammed Saud were arrested after their taxi was stopped in Birmingham. Police and MI5 had no idea about the plot, despite Uddin being named a ‘subject of interest’ in 2011 after he collected money for a terror cell, the members of which were jailed last week for more than 90 years for plotting suicide attacks using rucksack bombs. Ahmed was on bail for separate terror charges, and Hussain was the brother of Ishaaq Hussain, who was jailed for 40 months for his part in the rucksack bomb plot. Rally: The plotters were targeting this EDL rally in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, but were foiled because they arrived too late - after the crowds had gone . It also emerged that police and security services saw Uddin and Khan go into a shop in Birmingham five days before the planned attack. They bought kitchen knives but police were keeping their distance and didn’t see the purchase. Uddin, 27, Ahmed, 22, Khan, 31, Hussain, 24, Saud, 22, and Hasseen, 23, were told to expect ‘significant custody’ by Judge Nicholas Hilliard, QC, who adjourned sentencing until June 6. Marcus Beale, head of the counter terrorism unit at West Midlands Police, said: ‘We do not believe that any one individual failed because the dots were there and they did not join them up.’ Caught on camera: Five of the men are seen on CCTV in Dewsbury at approximately 4.37pm - two hours after the EDL rally had finished . Terror targets: EDL demonstrators were the target of the Muslim extremists at the rally in Dewsbury last June . Attack plan: Around 750 EDL members, rivals from Unite Against Fascism and dozens of police officers were at the rally which the Muslim extremists were targeting . Rally: Penned in by police, these are the EDL protesters in Dewsbury caught on police video from a helicopter. The gang of Muslim fanatics were targeting the protest . Rally finished early: The event was shorter than planned because EDL leader Tommy Robinson, a crowd pleaser, was not able to attend . A series of coincidences saw the plan . by Islamic fanatics to use bombs, guns and swords in a murderous attack . on far-right extremists foiled. Firstly, . the five members of the gang who drove to the event on June 30 last . year - all the men except Hasseen - made a mistake with their timing, . arriving two hours late because the rally had finished earlier than . expected. The event was shorter than planned because EDL leader Tommy Robinson, a crowd pleaser, was not able to attend. Seized: The group's Renault Laguna is stopped on the M1 motorway because it had no insurance and is seized - it was two days before the arsenal of weapons was discovered though . Then, . as Khan and Uddin drove their silver Renault Laguna back towards . Birmingham down the M1, it was recorded as uninsured when a traffic . officer happened to carry out checks because the car looked old. In . fact the gang had tried to insure the Renault for one day that morning, . but Saud had mistakenly entered the wrong registration number on an . online form. The car . was seized because it had no insurance, and the officer took Uddin and . Khan to a nearby train station so that they could get home. It was taken to a pound near Sheffield by Woodhead Motors, and left there until the following Monday morning. Staff . then checked the contents of the car and found the gang's array of . weapons including two shotguns, swords, knives, a nail bomb and a . partially assembled pipe bomb, along with a hate-filled note ranting . about the enemies of Islam. It . was only then that counter-terrorism units were called in, despite the . fact that police and security services already had Uddin under low-level . surveillance because he was on the periphery of another terrorist plot. Held: Traffic police stop Jewell Uddin and Omar Mohammed Khan on the M1 as they travelled back to their home town, Birmingham and seize the vehicle . This . was the plan by another group of extremists from Birmingham to set off . up to eight rucksack bombs and possibly other devices in an attack that . they wanted to be bigger than July 7. Uddin . had been seen with Khan going into a shop five days before the rally, . but no officer followed them into Home Choice in Sparkhill because . contact would have been too close. In fact they were going to buy the kitchen knives that were among the weapons that the gang planned to use. Neither . counter-terrorist police or the security services had any intelligence . to suggest that the men planned to stage an atrocity. After . their weapons were found, bomb squad were called to make the . shrapnel-filled rocket safe, and said afterwards that it was 'viable', . with the potential to cause serious injury or death. Counter-terrorism . teams launched a fast-moving operation, tracing Khan, who had initially . given a false name, and his passenger by scouring CCTV. Khan . had the gall to call the pound to say that he needed to get something . from the car, but unbeknown to him he was already under surveillance. Police believe that he made the nail bomb because his fingerprint was discovered on the sticky side of tape found on the device. West .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:48 EST, 1 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:28 EST, 1 February 2014 . As a drought tightens its grip on California, farmers in the Golden State are fearing harvests of almonds, oranges and grapes could be lost. The state's famed vineyards and other farms will be further affected by the decision yesterday to not send water from a vast reservoir system to local agencies in spring. The unprecedented move means water supplies for 25 million people, and irrigation for one million acres of farmland, will be forced to look to other sources. Run dry: A boating speed limit buoy stands out on the dry bed of Black Butte Lake last month . The announcement was timed to give farmers more time to determine what crops they will plant this year . and in what quantities. Farmers . and ranchers throughout the state already have felt the drought's . impact, tearing out orchards, fallowing fields and trucking in alfalfa . to feed cattle on withered range land. Without . deliveries of surface water, farmers and other water users often turn . to pumping from underground aquifers. The state has no role in . regulating such pumping. 'A . zero allocation is catastrophic and woefully inadequate for Kern County . residents, farms and businesses,' Ted Page, president the Kern County . Water Agency's board, said in a statement. 'While . many areas of the county will continue to rely on ground water to make . up at least part of the difference, some areas have exhausted their . supply.' Concerns: California's $61 billion a year wine industry may suffer if it loses access to vital water for next year's crop . Restricted access: Farmers in the state's usually productive agricultural region will have to limit their crops of almonds, above, and fruit . The drought could also have a worrying impact of California's $61 billion wine industry. While the conditions will not be too damaging on the 2014 crop, it could damage the buds appearing for 2015. It takes two years for a vine to bear fruit, so a drought this year could devastate crops for the following harvest. 'What we really haven’t seen that could happen is, if it’s dry enough, grapevines actually become damaged and start to die, so you don’t get the buds you need for the 2015 season,' viticulture professor Mark Matthews told Salon. 'That potentially could become devastating, and it’s not like when you’re growing corn or something when you can just plant again next year. It’s a 30-year commitment.' Friday's announcement that access to the reservoir has been cut off marks the first time officials have had to curtail the supply in the 54-year-history of the State Water Project. Even though the 29 agencies that use the state's water-delivery system have other sources, those have also been affected by the drought. Relic: The walls from a ghost town submerged under Folsom Lake since 1955 have reappeared because of the drought . Revealing: Foundations of the mining town are back on dry land after water levels dramatically receded in Lake Folsom . 'This is the most serious drought we've . faced in modern times,' Felicia Marcus, of the State . Water Resources Control Board, said. 'We need to conserve what little we have . to use later in the year, or even in future years.' Farmers in California's Central Valley, one of the most productive agricultural regions in the country, . can draw water from federally run reservoirs and . canals, but they will deliver just a fraction of the normal . water allotment this year. Director of the state's Department of Water Resources, Mark Cowin, said there simply wasn't enought water to meet the needs of farmers and cities. The conservation efforts were intended to save dwindling populations of salmon and other fish in northern California, he added. The state would need to experience heavy rain and snowfall every other day from now until May to get back to its average annual precipitation totals, according to the Department of Water Resources. 'These actions will protect us all in the long run,' Mr Cowin said. The latest restrictions come after Governor Jerry Brown made an official drought declaration halfway through January. He urged Californians to reduce their water use by 20 percent. Last year was the state's driest calendar year since records started being kept, and 2014 appears to be heading in the same direction. A snow survey on Thursday in the Sierra Nevada, one of the state's key water sources, found the water content in the meager snowpack is just 12 percent of normal. Reservoirs are lower than they were at the same time in 1977, which is one of the two previous driest water years on record. Stretched: The water level in Stevens Creek reservoir, pictured last week, has dropped . Gone: A security guard walks on the dry bed of Almaden Reservoir as California announces further water restrictions . State officials say 17 rural communities are in danger of a severe water shortage within four months. Wells are running dry or reservoirs are nearly empty in some communities. State water officials typically announce they are raising the water allotment on February 1, but this year's winter has been so dry they wanted to ensure they could keep the remaining water behind the dams. Groundwater levels already have been stressed, after pumping accelerated during the dry winter in 2008 and 2009. 'The challenge is that in the last drought we drew down groundwater resources and never allowed them to recover,' said Heather Cooley, of the Pacific Institute water policy think tank in Oakland. 'We're seeing long term, ongoing declining groundwater levels, and that's a major problem.' Many towns and cities already have ordered severe cutbacks in water use. With some rivers reduced to a trickle, fish populations also are being affected. Eggs in salmon-spawning beds of the American River near Sacramento were sacrificed after upstream releases from Folsom Dam were severely cut back. Levels in the manmade Folsom Lake have fallen so low that the walls of a ghost town, submerged when the lake was created in the 1950s, have started to emerge. The drought is highlighting the traditional tensions between groups that claim the state's limited water for their own priorities - farmers, city residents and conservationists. Chuck Bonham, director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, urged everyone to come together during the crisis.'It's not about picking between fish and farms or people and the environment,' he said. 'It is about really hard decisions on a real-time basis where we may have to accept some impact now to avoid much greater impact later.'","Officials ban access to vast reservoir to try to protect dwindling supplies .

A determined Christian evangelist has demonstrated his devotion to his faith by carrying a huge cross for thousands of miles across the globe for the past 26 years. Lindsay Hamon, 60, has trekked through 19 countries including India, New Zealand, Romania and Sri Lanka during his remarkable journey. And despite being thrown out of St Peter's Square, in Rome, being shot at in Bangladesh and attacked by angry zealots, he remains resolute and has no plans to give up on his mission. Determined: Christian evangelist Lindsay Hamon carries his cross through Wellington, Somerset as he makes his pilgrimage around the world . Trek: Mr Hamon carrying his cross through Romania. He has so far trekked through 19 countries around the world including India, New Zealand, Romania and Sri Lanka . Journey: Mr Hamon poses with his cross in Assam.  He first took up the 12ft 6in tall cross in 1987 and has spent only a handful of days without it . Exotic travels: Among the regions he journeyed through was South East Asia (pictured). His next trip abroad will be to Latvia . Father-of-two Lindsay said: 'There is a reaction from people straight away, you end up talking and connecting to people you wouldn't normally talk to. 'People start opening up about their own lives and you end up sharing with them something that is most personal. 'I find people often want to talk, but if people don't want to know I walk on. The love you get from it all is amazing, people will just stop and ask you questions, offer you food and sometimes a place to stay. Challenge: He is seen here carrying the cross in Walthamstow, east London during the earlier stages of his journey . Mr Hamon carries the huge cross, which . has a wheel at its base, over his shoulder for up to 12 . hours a day, and often has no idea where he will sleep that night. But the part-time care worker, from Camborne, Cornwall, admitted he has sometimes put his life at risk during his travels. He said: 'There is fear there sometimes because I have a wife and kids and you don't want to put yourself in danger. It is really trusting in God, knowing he will protect you.' He first took up the 12ft by 6ft tall cedar wood cross in 1987 and has only spent a handful of weeks without it. Mr Hamon receives generous donations from supporters to help him stay on the road, but he stops to carry out carework in his home town in order to pay his family's bills. 'I tried giving up my full time work and doing this full time instead but I didn't get enough money to make ends meet,' he added. Mr Hamon has spoken to thousands of curious people during his trek around the world and has shaken hands and prayed with many more. He often finds himself ministering to prostitutes or invited to brothels, and will regularly spend nights in bus shelters or basic accommodation with only a sleeping bag, and a hole in the floor for a toilet. Even language barriers do not hold the preacher back and he regularly finds himself mobbed by hundreds of locals wanting to hear him speak. Beginning: Mr Hamon smiles as he poses in front of his cross at the start of his travels around the world . Courage: He is confronted by police as he tries to carry the cross into Red Square, Moscow . Stamina: Mr Hamon in Lands End, Cornwall. The 60-year-old has needed remarkable mental and physical strength to make his trek . Compassion: He stops to pray with a stranger as he journey's around the world. Mr Hamon has helped many people in need during his travels . He said: 'As you can expect in the UK . language isn't a problem. I walk into town centres and try and say . hello to everyone I can but I realise that some people don't want to . talk. 'You shake hands with people a lot and . some ask you to pray with them. Oddly some of the best conversations I . have had have been at pubs where people are willing to sit down and give . the time to talk to you. Achievement: Mr Hamon carries his cross next to St Peter's Square, Rome - the headquarters of the Catholic Church . 'I can speak a bit of Spanish and French but other than that it can be a bit of a problem. He said that when he visits countries where he cannot speak the language he tries to write out a prayer in that language to show people. 'Often I will just pray in English anyway,' he said. 'Sometimes you get people who translate for you, I had one young boy who came out of nowhere when I was talking to around 20 or 30 people and he just translated everything. 'When it was done he just disappeared, I never knew who he was or where he came from, it's amazing.' He is currently on the road in England, travelling from Taunton, in Somerset, to Bristol, before heading south to Exeter and finally onwards to see his wife and dog at home in Cornwall. His next trip abroad will be to Latvia in May, before he moves on to Cambodia after the rainy season has ended. Lindsay has so far walked through; Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Holland, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Nepal, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Sri Lanka and the UK.","Lindsay Hamon, 60, has taken cross through 19 countries .

An interactive map that plots life . expectancy and child poverty by London Underground station has revealed the stark inequalities that exist in the UK's capital city. Children who live in the salubrious surroundings of Knightsbridge can expect to live to an impressive 90-years of age, yet their peers who reside just a few stops down the Piccadilly line in Hammersmith can only expect to reach 79. The largest contrast is between Oxford Circus, where youngsters are predicted to live to 96.38, and Star Lane on the Docklands Light Railway, where the life-expectancy is 75.3 years. SEE THE INTERACTIVE MAP BELOW... The map was designed by James Cheshire and Oliver O'Brien from the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at the University College London. The pair hoped to reveal how widely children's outlooks differ even though they live just minutes from eachother in the same city. The map covers zones 1, 2 and most of zone 3. Writing on his Spatial Analysis Blog, James Cheshire, said: 'It was my intention to create a memorable impression of the persistent inequalities along (and between) the routes travelled by millions of Londoners each day.' To create the map, the researchers drew circles with a 200m radius around each station and looked at existing life expectancy data from each city ward. If the circle covered more than one London ward an average was taken and all values were then rounded. The map found startling disparities all over London. For instance life expectancy decreases by 12 years on the 20 minute ride on the Central Line between Lancaster Gate and Mile End. Meanwhile simply crossing the Thames from Pimlico in the north to Vauxhall in the south sees life expectancy drop by six years.","Life expectancy varies from 75.3 years near Star Lane station to 96.38 at Oxford Circus .

Multiple people were injured today as chaos broke out on the streets of Bangkok the day before a general election which has divided Thailand. Gunshots rang out while at least two explosions were heard at anti-government protests, with six people wonded in front of a suburban shopping mall in the north of the city. Sporadic gunfire continued into the evening, with masked men openly firing handguns as security forces used M-16 rifles to fire warning shots into the air. Warning: graphic content . Gunman: A protester wielding a pistol on the streets of Bangkok ahead of the Thai general election . Opening fire: An anti-government gunman opens fire on a rival group after his convoy was attacked . Masked: Many of the gunmen were wearing balaclavas to hide their identities as they sought to disrupt the election . Hurt: A bloodied man and a woman look around a wall as a gun battle rages in the Bangkok suburbs . Tomorrow's election is almost certain to return prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra to power, despite efforts by some opposition supporters to disrupt the poll. The violence came amid generally peaceful protests around Bangkok and revived chilling memories of political unrest in 2010, when supporters of former leader Thaksin Shinawatra - Ms Yingluck's brother - paralysed Bangkok in protest against the Democrat Party. Today's attack took place in Bangkok's Laksi district, close to the Don Muang airport, where Ms Yingluck's fans gathered in support of the election. Ten people have died and at least 577 have been wounded in politically related violence since late November. Vandalism: An angry voter smashes up a car along with other supporters of the government . On the run: An injured protester attempts to get away from the violence after being caught in the crossfire . Agony: The man tries to stanch his wounds as blood covers his face while violence rages . Treatment: An injured protester who was shot by anti-government mobs is carried away by friends . The protests' leader, opposition boss Suthep Thaugsuban, has called for a peaceful blockade of roads, but has vowed not to stop people voting. 'The people will not close the polling booths, but will demonstrate on the roads,' he said yesterday. 'They will demonstrate calmly, peacefully, without violence. We won't do anything that will hinder people from going to vote.' Election Commission secretary-general Puchong Nutrawong said the commission has instructed staff to halt voting if there is rioting or other violence. 'We don't want this election to be bloody,' he said. 'We can get every single agency involved to make this election happen, but if there's blood, what's the point?' Rampage: Masked protesters, many carrying guns on their backs, take part in the violence . Shot: A gunman takes aim with his pistol on a day when at least six people were taken to hospital . Shelter: A protester hides behind a concrete barrier during the midst of the clashes . Lying down: A protester points his gun at pro-government forces . The military has stayed firmly on the sidelines so far, in contrast to the past. It has staged or attempted 18 coups in 81 years of on-off democracy. Ms Yingluck's party will almost definitely win the election, which the Democrat Party is boycotting, but experts expect further stalemate as the opposition is unlikely to accept the result. The protesters, camped out at major intersections in the city and blocking key roads, forced polling stations in 49 of Bangkok's 50 districts to shut last weekend - some voters were physically pulled away from the polling booths. Huddle: Peaceful protesters were forced to hide from the shooting after the demonstrations turned violent . Troops: The army has largely stay out of the conflict despite having staged several coups in the past . Panic: Civilians run to take cover from the violence, which has evoked memories of previous outbreaks . Mr Suthep wants to rid the country of the Shinawatra family's political influence and accuses MsYingluck, who swept to power in the last election in 2011, of being Mr Thaksin's puppet. The protesters say Mr Thaksin - who now lives in Dubai to avoid a jail term for graft - is a corrupt crony capitalist who took advantage Thailand's fragile democracy, using taxpayers' money to buy votes with populist giveaways. Mr Suthep wants to set up a 'people's council' of notable individuals before another election is held, effectively undermining the country's democratic processes.

A mother-of-three has lost half of her body weight after her daughter was teased by playground bullies for having a ‘fat mum’. Emma Dunne, 32, weighed 24 stone when her 10-year-old daughter, Stephanie, complained that children at school were making cruel comments about her size. 'She came home and said, ""Mummy, everyone at school says you’re fat"",' said Emma, of Gorey, Co Wexford, Ireland. Emma Dunne has gone from weighing 24st (right) and size 28, to just 12st (left) and a slim size 10 . Emma, pictured here with her son Seamus, 6, and daughters Stephanie, 10, and Siobhan, 7, decided to lose weight after her daughter got bullied at school over her mother's size . 'I was absolutely gutted and felt like I had let her down. I wanted to be a mum she could be proud of - not someone who just hid away.' A busy waitress and a single mother to Stephanie, Siobhan, seven, and Seamus, six, Emma was so big her children could not fully wrap their arms around her to give her a hug. Having spent years over-indulging on huge portions of shepherd’s pie, takeaways and cheese, Emma vowed to drop the pounds. 'I’d grown to hate my body, and shopping was a nightmare,' said Emma. Emma spent years indulging in super-sized portions of shepherd’s pie, takeaways and cheese . At her heaviest, Emma was so big her children could not fully wrap their arms around her to give her a hug . 'I was so big that I had to buy two pairs of size 28 jeans, cut the waistband off the second pair and use it to extend the first. 'It was so embarrassing. I felt like everyone was staring at me, and I had no confidence.' But it would prove to be these super-sized jeans that helped Emma drop an astonishing nine dress sizes, to a slim size 10. After ditching the junk food for fruit and vegetables and taking up running, Emma devised her own unique way to monitor her weight loss. She would visit the plus-size section of clothes shops, grab a pair of size 28 jeans - which used to be tight for her - and head straight to the changing rooms. Emma said: 'I know it sounds silly, but seeing my new body in these massive jeans really spurred me on. Emma devised her own unique way to monitor her weight loss, comparing her body to her old size 28 jeans . 'Every time I tried them on and they were even baggier, I could see how much progress I had made. 'On my first time, back in December 2012, I was a size 20, and even then I could see a huge difference. 'By the time I’d dropped to a size 16 in March 2013, I could even fit in one leg. And when I hit a size 12 in November last year, I celebrated by posing with a pair of size 12 jeans. Her incredible 12 stone weight loss means Stephanie can now put her arms all the way round her mother for the first time in years (right), and her old jeans swamp her new svelte frame (left) 'The shop assistants must have . thought I was mad, but I really do think it helped me lose all the . weight. It just proved to me that I never wanted to be that big ever . again.' One person who approved of Emma’s unusual weight loss tactic was her daughter, Stephanie. Although . her mum had previously been too big for her to hug properly, as the . weight fell off, Stephanie was able to reach further and further - . finally cuddling her mum for the first time late last year. Breakfast: None . Lunch: Large breakfast baguette from the local garage . Dinner: Over-sized portion of home-cooked pasta or shepherd’s pie, with a full block of cheese sprinkled on top. Then a takeaway once the children were asleep . Snacks: Sandwiches, crisps and chocolate . Breakfast: Porridge with almond milk, two poached eggs and a banana . Lunch: Toasted wholemeal wrap with chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber and onions with feta cheese . Dinner: Grilled salmon, broccoli and roasted baby potatoes . Snacks: Almonds, fruit or peppermint tea . Emma says: 'She called it her hug test. Once a week, she would give me a big hug to see how much weight I had lost.' Since losing the weight, Emma has seen her health improve dramatically. In June 2013 Emma completed the Flora Women's Mini Marathon . Whilst she used to struggle to walk up the stairs and suffered from sleep apnoea, she now regularly visits the gym and has a passion for weightlifting. In June 2013, she even completed the Flora Women’s Mini Marathon, which she says she would never have dreamed of attempting before. 'This is a change for life,' said Emma. 'I am so much more confident, and I no longer hide myself away. 'Before, I would stay in my car on the school run. Watching all of the slim, glamorous mums in their skinny jeans reminded me of how much I had let myself go - I was so ashamed. 'When Stephanie told me that other children had said I was fat, I felt like I had let her down too. I wanted to be a mum my kids would be proud of, and I promised myself there and then that I wouldn’t let my kids see me be buried in a super-sized coffin.' Emma plans to use her weight-loss trick to make sure that she doesn’t slip back into her old ways. 'Every once in a while, I’ll go back to the shops and try on my old-sized jeans,' she said. 'Whenever I’m tempted to order a takeaway or skip my daily run, I’ll think back to how horrible I felt when I had to wear them, and how much better I feel about myself now. 'I’ll never let myself go again. It’s not just my jeans that have gone from super-sized to super-skinny!'","Emma dropped from 24 stone and size 28 to 12 stone and size 10 .

A controversial new Facebook app shows users of the social network which of their online friends are prepared to meet up for no-strings attached sexual encounters. Bang With Friends claims to help users 'anonymously find friends who are down for the night' by pairing up any that are both attracted to each other. However, doubt has been cast over how anonymous the app really is, since it has an apparent loophole which shows prospective users which of their friends are already using it before signing up. Bang Your Friends: A new Facebook app claims to offer an anonymous method of finding which of your online friends are prepared to meet you for sexual liaisons . Logging into the app shows a screen filled with the profile pictures of your Facebook friends of the opposite sex - it appears to be designed exclusively for heterosexual pairings. Beneath each of the profiles listed sits a button labelled 'Down to Bang' which users can click to indicate that they are sexually interested in the friend in question. Clicking the button switches its label to 'Awaiting Bang' but will not notify them of your interest. Unless, that is, they are also users of the app and have also clicked the button beneath your face too. If that happens, then the app will send a notification email to the address listed on your Facebook account informing you that you have a match. However, despite its promises of anonymity, the app appears to have a serious glitch that could cause serious problems for users who prefer discretion. Like other Facebook apps, when users sign up to the service it shows a screen asking them if they are sure, but also showing which of their friends are already using the app. For many users, the revelation that they are out trawling for sex over Facebook could be the source of serious embarrassment. A second glitch seems to be that once users have indicated they are 'Down to Bang' a friend, there appears to be no way to revoke it - the button no longer works once it has switched to 'Awaiting Bang'. Not so discreet: This screengrab of the Bang With Friends app authorisation screen shows how pictures of any friend who is already signed up to the service are shown - which could be embarrassing . Buzzfeed writer Katie Heaney described the idea behind the app as 'icky'. 'Unless you're someone who believes (almost certainly wrongly, by the way) that your Facebook friends are all dying to hook up with you, and would do so if only given the bright blue button to admit it, the app doesn't really offer you anything you couldn't already accomplish on Facebook without it,' she wrote. 'How many people would really freely admit to wanting to hook up with a friend who wouldn't already have some indicator of interest? Shouldn't you already kind of know your chances with your Facebook friends? 'Part of the grossness of ""Bang With Friends"" is the way it conceives of friendship as something you only do to get to, well, banging.' At the time of writing, around 2,500 people had signed up to use the new app. MailOnline contacted the developers for comment, but has as yet received no response.","Bang With Friends claims to 'anonymously' discover which of your friends are up for sexual liaisons .

Police officers who interviewed Jimmy Savile in 2009 over child sex abuse allegations discouraged the Crown Prosecution Service from pursuing the case, it has emerged. The former BBC DJ, who died two years later, was interviewed under caution by Surrey Police at Stoke Mandeville Hospital after a woman claimed she had been abused as a girl at Duncroft Approved School for Girls in Staines in the 1970s. But, after a 41-minute interview in which he was also asked about abuse claims at Stoke Mandeville, he was allowed to walk free. Police discouraged prosecutors from pursuing child sex abuse claims made against Jimmy Savile in 2009 . And it has now emerged that on October 10 2009 - nine days after the interview, which took place in Savile's own office in the hospital - police advised prosecutors not to pursue Savile. In a newly-released note, officers told the CPS Savile had denied all of the claims, explaining that he, as a celebrity, attracts claims like these, according to the Mirror. The note, which had a number of grammatical errors, added: 'He stated if there was nay [sic] prosecution he would take the women to civil court and sue them for making unfounded allegations.' This note followed an interview in which Savile, 83 at the time, told police: 'I've never, ever done anything wrong.' This is a transcript of the interview conducted by Surrey Police with Savile in October 2009. It was released earlier this year by the force following a Freedom of Information request . The interview took place in Savile's own personal office at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Buckinghamshire . After this was accepted with an 'OK', Savile added: ‘That doesn’t mean to say that in my . business you don’t get accused of just about everything because people . are looking for a bit of blackmail or the papers are looking for a . story, so they keeps going up but if you gotta clear conscience which I . have everything’s okay.’ Savile was asked 50 questions through the interview, with the transcripts released earlier this year following a Freedom of Information request. An officer told the CPS: 'As previously advised this will be marked NFA [not for action].'

Students at Colorado University have been told that if they want to hold weapons on campus they must live together in segregated 'gun dormitories'. But the move to create the exclusive accommodation blocks at the university's Boulder and Colorado Springs campuses has failed to attract any takers in the three months since it came into effect. University administrators had previously introduced a blanket ban on guns on campus, however, in March Colorado Supreme Court upheld an appeals-court ruling to allow undergraduates to carry guns. Students at Colorado University, pictured, have been told that if they want to hold weapons they must live together in segregated 'gun dormitories' The new decision, which came into effect on August 16, states that students over the age of 21 who possess a permit to hold a concealed handgun must live in separate residential areas, with guns being banned on the rest of the campus. Attendees at university athletic and cultural events, such as American Football games and theatre shows, on both campuses are not permitted to bring guns. Colorado University Chancellor Philip DiStefano said in a statement: 'I believe we have taken responsible steps to adhere to the ruling of the Colorado Supreme Court, while balancing that with the priority of providing a safe environment for our students, faculty and staff.' The issue of guns on university campuses was forced into the spotlight in the wake of several campus shootings, the most deadly being the 2007 incident at Virginia Tech University. The move to create the exclusive accommodation blocks at the university's Boulder and Colorado Springs campuses has failed to attract any takers in the three months since it came into effect . However, while for some, these events . signal a need to ease existing firearm regulations and allow concealed . weapons on campuses, others see the solution in tightening restrictions . to keep guns off campuses completely. At . Colorado University the concealed-carry issue hit the headlines again . this month when a staff member with a concealed-carry permit at the . School of Dental Medicine on the Anschutz Medical campus accidentally . shot a co-worker while showing her gun. Currently, there are 21 states that ban carrying a concealed weapon on a college campus. These include California, Florida, Georgia, New York and Texas. In March Colorado Supreme Court upheld an appeals-court ruling to allow undergraduates to carry guns . In 23 states, such as Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut and Virginia the decision to ban or allow concealed carry weapons on campuses is made by each college or university individually. Due to recent state legislation and court rulings, five states now have special provisions allowing the carrying of concealed weapons on public post-secondary campuses.  These states are Colorado, Mississippi, Oregon, Utah, and Wisconsin. Utah remains the only state to have statute specifically naming public colleges and universities as public entities that do not have the authority to ban concealed carry, and thus, all ten public institutions in Utah allow concealed weapons on their property. Recently passed Wisconsin legislation creates a provision that colleges and universities must allow concealed carry on campus grounds, however, campuses can prohibit weapons from campus buildings if signs are posted at every entrance explicitly stating that weapons are prohibited.","University administrators had previously .

Police and immigration officials moved in yesterday to clear a ‘shanty town’ built by migrants in  a leafy London suburb. A total of 68 mainly Romanian squatters were found living in huts built from waste wood and plastic amid the filth of a tip at a former football ground. Just five of those at the camp, which was featured in the Daily Mail earlier this month, were found to have the right to work in the UK. Last month dozens of Romanian immigrants were evicted from their camp on the former site of Hendon Football Club in North London . Some 68 mainly Romanian squatters were living in the huts made of plastic and waste wood amid filth . Only five were found to have the right to work in the UK and the rest were offered flights back to Romania at a cost of £50 per ticket to the taxpayer . The Romanians had been living in shacks made out of discarded planks of wood and scrap metal . The rest were offered flights back to Romania at a cost of £50 per ticket to the taxpayer. Only 19 took up the offer. The rest were told they would have to . leave the country within 30 days, but were released on to the street to . live rough or in shelters, meaning it could cost up to £15,000 for . police to find each of them, monitor them and eventually remove them. Migrants have been living at the . vermin-infested former Hendon FC ground for more than two years despite . it having no running water, electricity or sanitation. They scavenged in . the rubbish for clothes to wear or things they could sell. Barnet Council sold the site to . developers for housing last year but legal challenges over the freehold . had held up the clearance of the site. The deal was finally completed . on Monday. Barnet Council said 19 of the 68 Romanians took up the offer of free flights home . The immigrants were said to have been living at the site for several months before Wednesday's raid . The Roma travellers were given papers ordering them to leave the site, which had 'danger' notices on display . Home Office officials and police raided the site at 5am yesterday before the squatters left to find work for the day. They were supported by a helicopter to . track any squatters who tried to escape, staff from the Romanian . embassy and workers for a homelessness charity. Paul Wylie, a Home Office official, . said his department had been working with the police and the council on . the site ‘for some time’. ‘Local residents had concerns, it had featured . in the Daily Mail and police believe there might be links to robberies . in the area,’ he said. ‘We have found 68 Romanians. Most are . immigration offenders with no right to work and cannot prove they have a . way of supporting themselves. Two tried to walk away but we had the . support of the police helicopter so we were able to get to them.’ Most of the illegal immigrants found at the site were men, who were living in filthy conditions, officials said . The site, which is just yards from people's homes, will now be cleared for development after a legal battle . Squalid conditions: The site was illegally occupied while a legal battle went on over its sale to a developer . Police officers picked through mountains of rubbish as they ensured every person had left the site . The derelict site is strewn with rubbish after being occupied on and off three times since 2009 . By midday yesterady, around 20 of the immigrants had agreed to take a free flight home to Romania . A Home Office spokesman said the . released squatters ‘are known to us and we will be looking to question . them again in the future, even in the next few days’. But he was unable . to say how they would be found, given that none had a home address. He . said immigration staff would ‘work with the police to track them’. Resident Gus Bodur, 49, was involved with Hendon FC and witnessed the raid. ‘I’m pleased the site is being cleared . but residents are angry it has taken so long to sort out and we are . upset that it will be the local taxpayer picking up the bill,’ he said. The site was being secured  yesterday . and the owner of the land is expected to provide 24-hour security to . ensure the squatters do not return. Early start: Police officers and Border Agency officials were at the derelict football club site at 5am .

In both sexes, people most at risk of self-harm are white, aged under 20, on remand or serving a life sentence, the Times reports. Incidents of self-harm among women were ten times highter than men - 24 per cent of females self-harmed within a year compared to just six per cent of males. Women jailed for violent crime were more likely to hurt themselves and the most common methods were cutting and scratching. Oxford University researchers looked at cases of self-harm between 2004 and 2009 and found there were 139,195 involving 26,510 prisoners. Other methods inmates used were poisoning, overdose, or self-strangulation.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 01:36 EST, 29 June 2011 . Every family in Britain is propping up the public sector pension scheme by £1,000 every year, David Cameron revealed as he called on thousands of civil servants, teachers and lecturers to quit Friday's planned strikes. About 750,000 public sector workers - about one in eight - are expected to walk out of their jobs tomorrow in protest against the Government's pension reforms. Government offices will shut, and nine in 10 schools are expected to close in some parts of the country disrupting the lives of millions. The cost of public sector pensions is the equivalent of £1,000 for every family in Britain David Cameron revealed . But speaking at a local government . conference in Birmingham yesterday, the Prime Minister said his . controversial pension reform plans were a ""good deal"" which would enable . affordable pensions to be secured for millions of public sector workers . for years to come. He said it was not fair that the . public purse contributed more than two thirds of the cost of . maintaining the public sector pensions - the equivalent of £1,000 per . household, according to the Daily Telegraph. Mr Cameron insisted change was necessary and the whole system was at risk . of going broke if it continued as it is. Pension reform is part of the government's effort to effectively wipe out a record budget deficit by 2015. Like other European governments, the Conservative-led coalition says reform is needed to make pensions affordable when people are living longer. Workers will pay more money into their pension savings and have to stay in their jobs for longer. Pensions will no longer be based on a worker's final salary before retirement. Mr Cameron said about 50 per cent of the public service pensioners receive less than £6,000 a year . Today, if a public sector worker retires . at 60, they can claim a pension for nearly 30 years, as opposed to 20 . years in the 1970s. Hitting back at critics who say public service pensions are too . generous, the Prime Minister said about 50 per cent of the public service pensioners . receive less than £6,000 a year. Free market think tank Reform said Mr Cameron needed to . reform the public sector pensions as the country was facing a ""bleak . future"" of rising taxes and rising deficit, the newspaper reported. A report by the think tank said pensions and health care will soar by £72billion a year by 2041. In a plea to workers planning to strike tomorrow, Mr Cameron said: ''In a democracy, people can go out and protest. But the people marching should know what they're objecting to, and I believe there are some misconceptions flying around.' 'So to those considering strike action, at a time when discussions are ongoing, I would say to you: these strikes are wrong -- for you, for the people you serve, for the good of the country. It's the changes we propose that are right.' Labour leader Ed Miliband agreed the strikes were a mistake but accused the coalition government of ""botching"" reform. Disruption: Thousands of teachers are set to take industrial action . Yesterday, it was revealed the cost of paying teachers’ pensions last . year was £7billion – and by 2015 it is expected to rise to £10billion. The average pension for teachers retiring at their normal pension age is around £10,300. But that figure includes many teachers with shorter careers, including some with just a few years’ service. A teacher retiring at their normal pension age after spending their whole career in the profession, with between 35 and 40 years of service, can on average expect to receive a pension of around £24,000. In addition, teachers who entered the scheme before 2007 receive an automatic lump sum worth three times their annual pension – so on average, £72,000. A secondary head teacher could expect to receive £42,000 a year, with a lump sum of £126,000. To enjoy such benefits in the private sector, you would need a pension pot of over £1.5million, ten times the average. The average pension in the UK is just £3,900 a year, which represents a pension pot of just £150,000. When the teachers’ pension scheme started, members put in the same as the taxpayer –  5 per cent of salary each. Today, members pay 6.4 per cent of salary in contributions, with employers contributing more than double that, at 14.1 per cent. For teachers working in the state sector, the employer contribution is met from funding provided by Government. The Treasury – and therefore the taxpayer – must meet the cost of any gap between the combined contribution of employees and employers and the cost of paying pensions. Surprisingly, private school teachers also qualify for a public sector pension, ostensibly so that teachers can move easily between the independent and state sectors.",David Cameron said public sector pension reform was essential or the system will go broke .

Choosing a Valentine's Day gift is always a fraught affair - but it looks like it might just be about to get easier. While most men could be forgiven for assuming that their other halves want to be spoilt with jewellery come Thursday, a new survey has revealed that all women really want for Valentine's Day is a hug. Given the choice, nine in ten women would choose a thoughtful, romantic gesture over a luxury gift of diamonds. Hug me tender: For most women, a big cuddle is at the top of their Valentine's Day wishlist . While many men believe jewellery and lingerie is the way to a woman's heart, most women would be happy with something that costs nothing such as a loving cuddle or a handwritten poem.The study found that a quarter of women would like their partner to write them a romantic poem, while eight per cent are hoping for a passionate embrace. But not every woman will be satisfied with a humble hug. A quarter of the female respondents to the British Heart Foundation survey revealed they would love to be whisked away for a luxury trip abroad this Valentine's Day. BHF Retail Director, Mike Taylor, said: . 'This survey shows you don't have to spend large sums of money to woo . your other half this Valentine's Day. 'In fact, romantic gestures like writing a love note or even just a hug can make your partner's day.'

Celebrities including Joey Essex, Mollie King, Mary Berry, Rick Parfitt, Fern Britton and Phil Vickery have all posted their Love Notes messages in BHF Shops. But although male A-listers seemed to understand the power of a romantic gesture - step forward Joey Essex - real men haven't quite gotten there yet. According to the survey, one in ten believe that cooking dinner is the way to a woman's heart, while a similar number thought that expensive jewellery or a day out shopping were guaranteed brownie point bankers. Nearly one in ten men (nine per cent) believe lingerie is the best gift, despite the fact that just one per cent of women agree. Interestingly, five per cent think that doing the housework is the most romantic gesture they could possibly make, while another two per cent astonishingly thought that not watching sport all weekend would do the trick for their other half. He's not known for his erudite wit or expert grasp of grammar but at least Joey Essex does know how to write a love letter from the heart.

The Federal Aviation Administration is 'looking into allegations' that pilots on Justin Bieber's chartered plane were forced to wear oxygen masks because the star and his entourage smoked so much marijuana. The aviation regulator also revealed today it would investigate claims that Bieber and his 38-year-old father Jeremy 'extremely verbally abused' a flight attendant until she was forced to hide in the cockpit. Bieber, 19, his dad and 10 friends traveled on the leased jet from Ontario, Canada, to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey last Friday ahead of the Superbowl. Scroll down for video . Accused: When Justin Bieber, pictured in New York on Monday, flew a . private jet from Canada to New York City to watch the Superbowl he . allegedly smoked to much marijuana on the plane the pilots had to wear . oxygen masks . Despite several warnings, the singer and his father Jeremy would not stop verbally abusing the flight attendant, and she eventually hid in cockpit with the pilots to avoid the passengers. ‘The captain of the flight stated that he warned the passengers, including Bieber, on several occasions to stop smoking marijuana,’ the official report of the incident, obtained by NBC News, reads. ‘The captain also stated he needed to request that the passengers stop their harassing behavior toward the flight attendant and after several warnings asked the flight attendant to stay with him near the cockpit to avoid any further abuse.’ The New York Post reported that police detected 'a strong odor of pot' and sent drug sniffing-dogs on board. According to a TMZ report, . the singer was flagged by U.S. Customs officials upon landing in New . Jersey because he has two criminal cases pending in Florida and in his . native Canada. On the morning after the jet was searched, Justin Bieber was spotted out in NYC posing for pictures with his adoring fans in the snow . False alarm: A police search found nothing suspicious and Bieber and his entourage were free to go . In trouble again? Justin Bieber, seen here on Wednesday, may have once again come under suspicion for using drugs . Under FAA regulations, 'No person may assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with a crew member in the performance of the crew member's duties aboard an aircraft', CNN reported. Under a civil statute, violators face penalties of $11,000 to $27,500, the FAA said. Under a criminal statute, violators face a maximum of 20 years in prison and fines up to $250,000. CNN reported the agency declined to say whether they were alerted by complaints from the pilots, by media reports, or the investigating officers. News of the latest incident tops off a week full of legal trouble for the Canadian star. Last week, he turned himself into Toronto authorities after being charged with assault. TMZ reported that the fight with the limo driver began when Bieber asked for the music to be turned up. The driver obliged, but not as much as Bieber was hoping, so he apparently stuck his hand through the partition to do it himself. The driver swatted his hand away and then it erupted into a full-on smack fest as Bieber then hit the driver in the head multiple times. He already faces a charge of driving under the influence after getting caught drag racing in Miami. Bieber has pleaded not guilty to DUI, resisting arrest without violence and driving without a valid license in the Miami case. A preliminary toxicology report released last week showed that he tested positive for marijuana and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax. Bieber told police after the arrest that he had been smoking marijuana and had taken a prescription drug, saying that his mother gave him the medication. Being held: The private plane that allegedly brought Bieber, his father, and their entourage to New Jersey's Teterboro airport was searched by authorities after landing . Role model: Bieber's father, Jeremy, is said to be going to watch the Super Bowl with his music star son this weekend . Bad week: Bieber was arrested for DUI in Miami last Thursday (pictured) and turned himself in on assault charges in Canada on Wednesday, but also has outstanding vandalism charges against him in California . His father was with him while they were in Florida and was at his side in Canada on Wednesday. Late Thursday, Bieber posted a photo of his father, Jeremy, with a praise-filled caption. 'I have the greatest Dad in the world. He's taught me how to love, learn, and stay true to myself. I will forever be grateful because he was my superhero,' he wrote on his Instagram photo. In California, the singer remains under investigation for an egg-tossing incident that left his neighbor's house with thousands of dollars in damage. If Bieber is charged in that case, a California judge may look at him more harshly in light of the Florida and Toronto cases, said Stan Goldman, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles. Bieber has not addressed the vandalism claim in California, and his attorney Howard Weitzman has said the singer's legal team believes their client is innocent in the Toronto case. His court date for the Miami DUI incident has been set to March 3, two days after he turns 20. A Miami-Dade County judge set trial for the three misdemeanors; driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an invalid license. Bieber's lawyers have already filed a written plea of not guilty and initial trial dates are often delayed.

Making rape victims relive their harrowing assault can actually help them come to terms with their ordeal, a new study has found. After the so-called 'exposure therapy', 83 per cent no longer had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. They . fared much better than girls who got only supportive counselling - 54 . per cent in that group no longer had PTSD after treatment. The results are the first evidence that the same kind of 'exposure' therapy that helps combat veterans haunted by flashbacks and nightmares also works for traumatised sexually abused teens with similar symptoms, the study authors and other experts said. Edna Foa, from the University of Pennsylvania, said that 83 per cent of those who took part in the study no longer suffered flashbacks and nightmares as a result of the therapy. Girls who got exposure therapy also had much better scores on measures of depression and daily functioning than girls who got conventional counselling. 'It's common to think that offering just comforting words and encouraging traumatized youngsters to forget their ordeals is protecting them, but that's 'not doing them any favours,' said University of Pennsylvania psychologist Edna Foa, the lead author. She said that approach can be harmful because it lets symptoms fester. Foa developed a two-part treatment known as prolonged exposure therapy and has studied its use in treating post-traumatic stress disorder. It involves having patients repeatedly tell their awful stories, and then visit safe places that remind them of the trauma, or take part in safe activities they'd avoided because of painful reminders. 'Many are actually relieved that somebody wants to hear their story,' Foa said. The Veterans Affairs health system uses the treatment for vets with PTSD. Foa's previous research has shown this approach works for adult rape victims, and it is used in some rape crisis centres. 'Exposure therapy': Victims had to repeatedly tell their stories and then visit safe places that remind them of the trauma . Her new study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Sixty-one girls aged 13-18 were recruited at a rape crisis centre in Philadelphia. They had been raped or sexually abused, sometimes repeatedly, often by a relative. All had been diagnosed with PTSD. The researchers provided four days of prolonged exposure training for counsellors at the centre and two days of supportive counselling training. The teens were randomly assigned to 14 weeks of counselling or prolonged exposure therapy from the counsellors. Sessions lasted an hour or 90 minutes. At first, most were very upset talking about what had happened. But by telling and re-telling their trauma, 'they get a new perspective of what happened,' Foa said. The research into 'exposure therapy' was carried out at the University of Pennsylvania . 'They get used to thinking and talking about the memory and realizing that it was in the past, that it's not in the present anymore.' Eventually, 'the story becomes remote and they get closure,' she said. Benefits of the prolonged exposure therapy lasted throughout a one-year follow-up. A JAMA editorial said many therapists are reluctant to try the treatment with kids because of concerns that it might worsen symptoms, but that the study should raise awareness of the benefits. The study 'should allay therapist concerns about any potential harmful effects of exposure,' said editorial author Sean Perrin, a psychologist at Lund University in Sweden and a specialist in PTSD treatment in kids. The distress that comes with reliving the trauma usually dissipates within a few sessions, and is essential to recovery, he said.","University of Pennsylvania psychologist Edna Foa carried out the study on young female victims of sexual assault .

The BBC’s former director general and two of his key lieutenants personally apologised for wasting £100million on a failed IT project yesterday. In a grovelling appearance before the Commons public accounts committee, Mark Thompson said sorry to MPs and taxpayers for the Digital Media Initiative (DMI) fiasco ‘that meant the loss of a lot of public money.’ He said: ‘I just want to say sorry. I want to apologise to you and to the public for the failure of this project.’ Scroll down for video . Mark Thompson, former director general of the BBC, apologised for the failure of the DMI project while being grilled by MPs . Mr Thompson was joined by his former finance chief Zarin Patel and the . head of the BBC Trust’s finance committee Anthony Fry, both of whom took . responsibility for their part in the debacle. But the triple apology . was marred by the unrepentant stance of former BBC chief operating . officer Caroline Thomson, who was put in charge of DMI in April 2011.Not . only did she fail to apologise for wasting the money, she also refused . to hand back a £680,000 severance payoff she was handed in 2012 – and . boasted the huge windfall had enabled her to pursue her dreams as a . ballet director. The closest Miss Thomson came to admitting . responsibility was when she said she ‘could have made a misjudgment’ by . failing to spot DMI was struggling in 2011, although she did not accept . this was definitely the case. Refusing to hand back her severance . money, she said she could ‘understand’ those who felt it was excessive, . but insisted: ‘I did a very big and responsible job. I could have earned . a lot more if I had been working for ITV or in the commercial sector.’ Damning: The BBC was accused not having a grip on the huge project which ran into trouble, costing £98million . Sacked: John Linwood, pictured, whose £280,000 contract was terminated . When . the Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was launched in 2008, it was hailed . by BBC chiefs as 'the single most important initiative we are working . on'. But before a year had . elapsed, it was floundering so badly insiders referred to it as 'Don't . Mention It.' The BBC originally appointed IT firm Siemens to implement . the scheme. But it ditched the company in 2009 as the project floundered . and took it back in house. By then, £26million had already been wasted but it is understood the BBC later recouped the cost from Siemens. In . February 2011, the National Audit Office condemned the corporation over . its handling of the DMI after it ran 21 months behind schedule. The . public spending watchdog found the expected gains had been overstated . and the difficulty of delivering it was underestimated. The Public Accounts Committee criticised the BBC for awarding the contract to Siemens without putting it out to open tender. The . project was meant to allow production staff to access all video and . audio material - for example last year's Olympics coverage - on their . computers. As hundreds of . staff moved to the corporation's new headquarters in Salford, this would . prevent them having to transport tapes of archive material by road from .

"By . James Salmon . PUBLISHED: . 19:42 EST, 7 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:42 EST, 7 February 2014 . The Bank of England has been rocked by allegations it turned a blind eye as traders rigged foreign currency rates. Traders at some of the world’s biggest banks have claimed they told officials in 2012 that they routinely shared sensitive information about currency orders from customers with rivals, which could be used to fix their bets. Last night Conservative and MPs called for an inquiry into the ‘extremely serious’ allegations. Notes of the meeting in April 2012 between two officials from Threadneedle Street and currency dealers have already been handed to City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority. Revelation: The Bank of England is alleged to have known about rigging of foreign currency rates . It is alleged that when confronted with the evidence the Bank of England officials said they had no policy on the practice of sharing foreign currency information and that banks should make their own rules. Accusations that officials failed to raise the alarm or even condoned the practice are highly damaging for the Bank of England, and come in the midst of a worldwide probe into whether banks rigged the £3 trillion a day foreign currency market. The sprawling investigation kicked off last year after revelations from whistleblowers from a number of banks. Those under the spotlight include Barclays, Lloyds and Royal Bank and Scotland - which at least twenty bank traders thought to have been fired or suspended. Two of those traders, one from Citigroup and another from Swiss giant UBS, were present at the crunch meeting in April 2012. The Bank of England has already been heavily criticised for being slow to act over the manipulation of ‘Libor’ interest rates, which are used to set anything from the price of mortgages to bets on complex financial instruments. Investigation: A number of banks are being investigated over the allegations of rigging . Former deputy governor Paul Tucker was forced to deny claims he sanctioned Barclays’s manipulation of Libor, after embarrassing emails were published documenting  his phone calls with disgraced former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond. Barclays was fined £290million over the Libor scandal in June 2012, with Mr Diamond forced to resign just days later. Regulators, including the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and Serious Fraud Office, are now investigating  whether banks also conspired to manipulate benchmarks used for giant trades on foreign currency movements. Whistleblowers have claimed that traders rigged their own bets by pushing the benchmark rate for trades in foreign currency up or down. This could be achieved by sharing information about currency orders from clients with other banks, shortly before the benchmark rate was set in London at 4pm.  By doing this traders could gain an impression about probable moves in currency markets. The Bank of England was not responsible for regulating UK lenders until April 2013 but it is supporting the FCA probe. Last night it refused to confirm nor deny the allegations but published the minutes of the meeting, following a Freedom of Information Act request. The minutes make a fleeting reference to discussions on rules for foreign currency trading. Last night, MPs demanded answers from the Bank of England. Mark Garnier,Conservative MP and member of the influential Treasury Select Committee said: ‘There is a question as to whether these traders were sharing market intelligence or colluding to manipulate rates. If the Bank of England and other regulators let information slip through the net it should be hammered. Individuals must be held accountable.’ Shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie called for a Treasury inquiry. ‘These are extremely serious allegations and we need to know exactly who knew what and when. We need a crack team of enforcers to stamp out wrongdoing, not a team of Keystone Cops.’ A spokesman for the Bank of England said: ‘The Bank of England has already released its record of the April 2012 meeting, and we are continuing to support the FCA in its investigations.’","Traders claim they told Bank about information sharing in 2012 .

KTTC reported Allen left his shop on Highway 63 after 4.30pm Sunday and believed someone tried to break into the business that evening. He said he noticed the door was open when he returned to work about 6.45am the next day, but thought an employee had arrived before him. Alarm bells were raised when he saw the wall-mounted novelty fish on the floor. Money that had been left in 'a very visible spot' was incredibly left untouched.

'There were plenty of things to take but nothing was missing … other than Billy’s pride,' he said. None of the store's supplies were stolen, but there was $700 in damage to the door. The singing fish, designed to look like a trophy catch, was extremely popular about 10 years ago. The plastic fish turns its head towards a person and wiggles its tail on a trophy plaque and sings kitschy cover songs. The prop was originally activated by a motion sensor to startle a passerby. Later models had activation buttons. Scene: The robber allegedly tried to break into this 'Hooked on Fishing' bait and tackle shop at 5510 Highway 63 in Rochester, Minnesota .

Stephen Brawn celebrates being cleared of rape after having sex with a sleeping woman and posting the footage on Facebook . A man has today been cleared of rape after filming himself having sex with a sleeping woman before posting the footage on Facebook. Speaking after a jury at Ipswich Crown Court acquitted him, Stephen Brawn blasted police claiming he should 'never have been charged'. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, complained to police that she had been raped by the 22-year-old. She told officers she had not consented to having sex when she was asleep and as a result had not given her permission for the encounter to be filmed. The woman said she only found out about the video clip when a relative spotted that Brawn had uploaded it on to his Facebook page on May 30. Brawn admitted posting the footage on the social networking site, but he claimed the woman had earlier consented to him filming them having sex with her while she slept. A jury of eight women and four men took an hour deliberating the facts of the case before returning a unanimous not guilty verdict, following the two-day trial at Ipswich Crown Court. Earlier Judge John Devaux told the jury: 'It is often said that the crown court is not a court of morals. 'He is charged with rape and you won't convict him simply because he put footage of the act on Facebook.' The jury was told that the one minute video clip, taken on Brawn's mobile phone, clearly identified the woman and showed she was asleep. Prosecutor Charles Myatt said the woman claimed that she previously had no idea that Brawn had sex with her while she was asleep and had recorded it. He added: 'She says she wouldn't have consented to sex between them being videoed while she was asleep.' A jury of eight women and four men deliberated for an hour at Ipswich Crown Court, pictured, before returning a unanimous not guilty verdict . Mr Myatt said Brawn laughed when police arrested him on June 4 on suspicion of raping the woman at her home in Ipswich, Suffolk. He then made no comment when interviewed by police. Brawn told the court how the woman had asked him to record him having sex with her while she was asleep so that she could watch it the next morning. He said that he showed her the recording in the morning after she asked to see it and she then initiated sex with him. Mr Brawn said the case 'should never have gone to court'. He admitted filming the encounter but denied rape . Asked by his barrister Steven Dyble why he had posted the footage on his Facebook page he said: 'I don't know.' Brawn said he had laughed when he was arrested because he could not believe the woman had accused him of raping her. He said that he and the woman had been exchanged intimate photographs on their mobile phones and he had also filmed her performing a sex act on him. Brawn claimed he had sex with the woman when she was asleep on a day between May 10 and May 15 this year. His friend Daniel Marden also gave evidence in the trial, saying that Brawn had told him that the woman had consented to being filmed. Mr Marden said the conversation happened shortly after Brawn posted the video on Facebook and before the woman made her complaint to police. Last night jobless Brawn who is of no fixed abode said: 'I should never have been charged in the first place. 'I have been under a huge amount of stress due to this case hanging over me. I haven't been sleeping or eating properly for months. 'I got remanded in custody for two weeks after I was charged and I was banged up on the sex offenders' wing at Norwich prison. 'This case should never have gone to court if the police had done their job properly. 'They should have looked at this woman's other mobile phone which would have shown we had been swapping intimate pictures of each other.'","Stephen Brawn admitted filming the encounter and uploading it on the social networking site on May 30 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:27 EST, 27 June 2011 . A jet that can fly from London to Sydney in three and a half hours could rob Concorde of its title as the fastest-ever passenger plane. Plans have been unveiled for the Hypermach SonicStar, a business jet which will be capable of a top speed of 2,664mph – twice as fast as Concorde.It will fly at 62,000ft, allowing passengers to see the curvature of the earth. Hypermach chief executive Richard Lugg wants the plane in the skies within ten years and has already secured funding from the Department of Trade and Industry, which has agreed to support the company in Britain. Return of supersonic travel: The SonicStar aircraft will be twice as fast as Concorde - so quick that travelling from London to New York will take just two hours. It was unveiled at the Paris Air Show . CABIN . Visiting the Paris Air Show, Mr Lugg said: . ‘We have access to revolutionary engine technology and a unique very . high speed aircraft design to make this kind of earth-shatteringly fast . air travel possible. ‘And we have a date. Our plan is to build and fly the world’s first very high speed supersonic hybrid aircraft by June 2021.’ Propulsion for the 20-seat aircraft will come from two hybrid engines . which will be 30 per cent more fuel efficient than the Rolls-Royce . engines used in Concorde. It has been eight years since Concorde was retired from service, and with it the supersonic dreams of millions around the world. HyperMach claims its SonicStar aircraft will be so quick that travelling from London to New York will take just two hours. A trip from New York to Sydney, meanwhile, will be cut by a staggering 75 per cent - from 20 hours on a commercial airliner to just five hours. It will be able to cruise at Mach 3.1, a speed made possible by S-MAGJET hybrid gas turbine engine technology; nobody has ever travelled that fast before. Its top speed, however, will be Mach 3.6. With relatively low fuel consumption, the Sonic Star 'overcomes the economic and environmental challenges of  supersonic flight to revolutionise the way we travel and drive air transportation forward into the future,' claims HyperMach. By using electromagnetic currents across . the fuselage to suppress the sonic boom, the plane is able . to overcome the noise regulations that constrict supersonic travel. It has a range of 6,000 nautical . miles and its 54,700 thrust class S-MAGJET engine - actually two engines . - is optimised to fly the aircraft at 62,000ft. But it is the reduction in jet engine emissions that HyperMach believes will prove the secret of SonicStar's success. Tomorrow's world: HyperMach plans to build its SonicStar engine by the end of the decade and to have the plane itself constructed by 2025 . SonicStar will be able to cruise at Mach 3.1, a speed made possible by S-MAGJET hybrid gas turbine engine technology . A spokesman said: 'The engine is a true hybrid. It generates massive electrical power on board using proprietary integrated turbine electromagnetic generation technology to segment each engine rotating component stage electrically. 'Every stage from bypass fans to compressor to turbine, rotates independently of the other.' This segmentation will enable the engine to change the operating speeds of its rotating components continually throughout the flight to respond to the changing conditions of the atmosphere and the flight and performance demands of the aircraft. HyperMach claims that this, along with the S-MAGJET plasma fuel combustion technology, will result in a 40 to 50 per cent increase in the ability of the engine to convert fuel to thrust. The company said such fuel efficiency would ultimately lead to a 30 to 35 per cent reduction in fuel used as supersonic speeds.","SonicStar plane will have a top speed of Mach 3.6 .

"By . Jenny Hope . PUBLISHED: . 21:05 EST, 7 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 21:05 EST, 7 February 2014 . Around 700 doctors, nurses and health experts are calling on the Government to ban smoking in cars carrying children ahead of a Commons vote on Monday. In a letter to the British Medical Journal (BMJ), respiratory experts said secondhand smoke was a ‘major cause of ill health in children’. They said it was damaging to developing lungs, caused sudden infant death and resulted in thousands of hospital trips every year. Ban: Hundreds of doctors have expressed support for a crackdown on smoking in cars . Signatories to the letter are being co-ordinated by Dr Nicholas Hopkinson from Imperial College London and chairman of the British Thoracic Society’s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease specialist advisory group. The letter said ‘Secondhand exposure to tobacco smoke is a major cause of ill health in children. ‘Smoke inhalation damages the developing lung, and the Royal College of Physicians estimates that each year in the UK it is responsible for 300,000 primary care contacts, 9,500 hospital admissions, at least 200 cases of bacterial meningitis and 40 sudden infant deaths. ‘Most of this additional burden of disease falls on the more disadvantaged children in society, and all of it is avoidable.’ The Mail revealed last month that the ban could soon become law. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says he does not support the policy. Mr Clegg, who smokes, said it was ‘a stupid thing to do when a child is in the back of a car’ but said he did not want to ‘sub-contract’ parenthood. Danger: Respiratory specialists believe that a ban will help prevent the spread of lung cancer . But the BMJ letter says those objecting to a change in law assumed there was a ‘right to force children to breathe tobacco smoke’. Objectors ‘seem to value this more highly than the children’s right to breathe clean air’, it says. The letter comes as a minister announced yesterday there would be a free vote in the Commons on the issue on Monday. Transport minister Robert Goodwill told MPs he would vote in favour of the ban, having been forced to sit in the back of a car as a child while his father smoked. The vote comes as the Children and Families Bill returns to the Commons. The Bill was amended in the House of Lords last week after Labour tabled an amendment which would give the Health Secretary the power to make it illegal to smoke in a car carrying children. Peers have now accepted a Government-backed version of the amendment. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Ash, said ‘Every day doctors see children with illnesses resulting from exposure to second-hand smoke, causing harm which is entirely preventable. ‘We understand why they feel so strongly and support their call to put an end to children’s exposure to smoking in cars.’ Simon Clark, director of Forest, said ‘Smoking in cars with children is inconsiderate but there is a line the state shouldn’t cross when it comes to dictating how people behave in private places. ‘Very few adults smoke in a car with children these days. Government should take encouragement from that and focus on education not legislation. ‘We urge MPs to reject this unnecessary intrusion into people’s private lives and trust parents to make the right decision for their children without the need for heavy-handed state intervention.’",Respiratory experts write to the British Medical Journal to support ban .

When Lesley Cooper separated from her first husband, she was left to fend for herself and her two daughters while they had no roof over their head. For four years in the 1970s, the family . were forced to move from house to house and learned to feed themselves . on the little money they had. This meant the mother-of-two came up with various recipes which enabled her to make breakfast, lunch and dinner from the pennies in her jar. Now, the 62-year-old has developed more than 150 of the cut-price methods which can now feed a family for less than £1 a day. Bargain bites: Lesley Cooper, 62, claims she has more than 150 recipes which show you can feed yourself for less than 50p . Miss Cooper, who is retired, said: 'Without a roof over my head and no money . at all, I learnt to budget. I know that when you’re struggling, having . something nice to eat becomes even more important and I want to show . it’s possible to have that. 'Most people I speak to say you can’t feed yourself for under 50p but I have over 150 recipes which show that well actually, you can. 'Right now, there are a lot of individuals in Britain who are struggling. I’m just trying to get the message across that you can make good food for a reasonable price.' A typical day consists of 4p pancakes for breakfast, spiced parsnip soup for 17p with 2p tomato scones for lunch and a supper of bacon and sweetcorn pie with mash and peas for just 32p. To top it all off, there’s a muscovado cheesecake for dessert which costs only 33p to make. Tight-budget: She learned to make the cut-price meals while providing for her two daughters while the family was homeless in the 1970s . Penny pincher: Her specially-made vegetable crumble costs only 40p . Miss Cooper, who lives with her partner of 32 years, Mike Negus, admits: 'I get a thrill from a bargain. Although I don’t really have any major financial fears anymore, my early years were quite rough. 'I know what it feels like to worry about money - that memory never leaves you. So finding or making something that doesn’t cost too much is a real buzz for me.' At the age of 16, Miss Cooper met an older man and fell pregnant. She married him but realised it was was a mistake. She left her husband while pregnant with her second child and returned to her parents’ house. However it was so crowded that her and her children had to sleep under a table. She was homeless between 1971 and 1975 before she moved into a council house with her two children, Tracey and Sam. A a daily meal plan from left to right: It begins with pancakes for breakfast, costing 4p, lunch is a tomato scone made for 2-3p alongside 17p spicy parsnip soup. Dinner is bacon and sweetcorn pie with mash and peas (32p) followed by Muscovado Cheesecake, made for 33p . 'There was literally no room left at my family home and so for the next four years, my daughters and I ricocheted from place to place. We had nowhere to live and although we never actually slept rough, it came horrifyingly close. The experience left Miss Cooper with an interest in ‘all things frugal’. Even today, she will do anything to cut costs, making her body moisturiser from scratch by mixing glycerine and water together. For each seven-day meal plan, the cut price chef sets out an amount to take to the supermarket along with a shopping list.The food is then supposed to feed two people for a week, but some of the items are left over. The above meal plan costs just £12.26 for the week (that is £6.13 per person). However, you have to take £15.89 to the checkout so you can buy full amounts. She also serves up her budget dishes - such as 15p gnocchi made from instant mashed potato - at dinner parties. 'My £1-per-day meals are lovely, they’re just as a good as a more expensive dish. I’ve made them for plenty of guests and no-one’s ever been able to guess the price. 'People always talk about needing more money to have a better life. But really if you just make better use of the money that you do have, then you can achieve the same thing.' Miss Cooper has spent years designing the meals. She claims they follow the government guidelines and provide one person's five a day. Her meal plans and recipes are recorded on her blog Thrifty Lesley.

A secret government report has revealed that thousands of migrants from the European Union have tried to claim British state handouts through bogus marriages and fraudulent welfare claims. Immigrants have also used false documents and lied about being related to EU citizens in order to cheat their way to UK taxpayers' money, the unpublished Home Office report states. Criminal gangs have even smuggled people into Britain, forced them to open bank accounts so they can claim benefits before taking the money and leaving them penniless and forced to beg on the streets, according to the dossier. A secret Home Office report has revealed that thousands of migrants from the European Union have tried to claim British state handouts through bogus marriages and fraudulent welfare claims (file photo) The report, which has been seen by The Sunday Telegraph, has highlighted the exploitation of 'free movement' immigration rights given to EU citizens, allowing them to move anywhere withing the EU to work. It has prompted ministers into a five-year push to convince leaders in Brussels that action must be taken to halt this abuse. The document, entitled Evidence of Fraud and Abuse of Free Movement in the UK, was submitted to the European Commission by Home Secretary Theresa May last year in response to a request for evidence of the scale of abuse of the free movement rights. After being given documentation from governments across the EU the Commission found that 'robust safeguards' already in place to ensure the free movement rights were not being abused. The Home Office report was supposed to have been published last week, prior to Thursday's Commons debate over the Immigration Bill, but was delayed. David Cameron was embarrassingly forced to rely on Labour and Liberal Democrat votes to face down a mass rebellion by his backbenchers over immigration. The report has highlighted the exploitation of 'free movement' immigration rights given to EU citizens, allowing them to move anywhere withing the EU to work . The . Prime Minister appeared unable to control his party as 86 Tory MPs . voted to stop foreign prisoners using the right to a family life in the . Human Rights Act to stay in Britain. In a further blow, the Conservative Party's attempts to pass legislation . guaranteeing a referendum on Britain’s EU membership was killed . off by Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords on Friday. The government have been accused of attempting to conceal evidence by delaying the publication of the report, with some Tory MPs saying it should have released so it could be discussed in parliament. Instead the document is expected to be published this week as part of an EU scrutiny select committee report - too late for it to it to be read by MPs debating the Bill. According to the report, the principle ways migrants, both from Europe and elsewhere, abuse the free movement for workers right granted to EU citzens is through sham and proxy marriages, benefit fraud and false documents. Concerns were raised over 1,891 suspected sham marriages involving people applying to live in Britain after marriage to a UK or EU citizen in 2012 . The document, entitled Evidence of Fraud and Abuse of Free Movement in the UK, was submitted to the European Commission by Home Secretary Theresa May last year in response to a request for evidence of the scale of abuse of the free movement rights . Concerns were raised over 1,891 suspected sham marriages involving people applying to live in Britain after marriage to a UK or EU citizen in 2012, according the The Sunday Telegraph - an increase of 957 from 2010. Currently there are 23 police probes either being carried out, or in the planning stages into sham marriage rings linked to criminal gangs in the  North West of England, while a London vicar earned £30,000 through officiating almost 250 sham marriages. Marriage registrations carried out by proxy, in which one or even both partners are represented by another person in their absence, are legal in some countries and in a study of 200 EU residence card applications in October 2013 revealed 16 per cent of all marriage certificates put forward as supporting evidence had been from proxy marriages. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said the dossier had been shown to MPs on the EU scrunity committee . A criminal network which used proxy marriage certificates and fake or stolen ID cards to try to get people into Britain illegally was also uncovered in a separate investigation. According to the newspaper, a Romanian gang trafficked more than 1,000 children into the UK - forcing them into theft, begging and benefit fraud. The Metropolitan Police’s Operation Golf uncovered a £2.9 million benefit fraud scam by a Romanian gang, while in other cases, having been convinced to come to the UK drug addicts and people with mental health issues were forced to open bank accounts to receive falsely claimed state handouts. 'It is clear that criminal gangs exploit the free movement rights of EU citizens in order to facilitate significant fraud against the UK benefits system,' the report states. The report also says that 83 per cent of the 1,652 false papers seized at ports and airports by border officials in 2012 were either from the EU or the European . Economic Area, made up of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway from the . European Free Trade Association and 27 member states of the EU. This had risen from 73 per cent of the 1,770 fraudulent documents seized in 2009. Conservative MP Nigel Mills, who represents Amber Valley in Derbyshire, questioned why the Home Office report was not published at the same time as it was put to the European Commission, and priot to the debate over the Immigration Bill. 'If there is some reason why it hasn’t been published, we ought to hear it because it is going to look very suspicious to a lot of people,' he said. Although the dossier has not been made public, Immigration Minister Mark Harper said it had been shown to MPs on the EU scrunity committee. In a statement given to MailOnline he said: 'Years of pressure from the UK and other Member States that share our views has forced the European Commission to finally acknowledge that free movement abuse is a genuine EU problem. 'This document was created as part of evidence provided to the EU Commission outlining these concerns. I have also shared this document with the European Scrutiny Committees in both houses for further consideration. 'The government is clear that EU citizens who benefit from the right to free movement must adhere to the responsibilities this brings with it. We will not tolerate the abuse of free movement rights and are working at a domestic level and with other Member States to tackle such abuse.'","Migrants have used fraudulent documents to claim handouts, report states .

With help from a NASA astronaut, Space Mountain opened in January 1975 at Disney's Magic Kingdom park in Orlando, Florida. The idea began with Walt Disney in the 1960s, but the technology did not exist to bring his vision to life. Later, when the attraction was given the green light, Mercury 9 and Gemini 5 astronaut Gordon Cooper joined the Space Mountain creative team as a consultant. He wanted to make sure that the attraction incorporated information gleaned during NASA’s early space missions and that the experience felt like actual space flight. His valuable input has made Space Mountain a favorite at the Disney Park for over 35 years. Disneyland didn't get their Space Mountain until 1977, more than two years after Magic Kingdom got theirs in 1975. These pictures were taken at the Orlando park as the ride was being built in 1974.

Row: Toulouse and Algeria have both rejected Mohammed Merah's body, leaving a dilemma as to where he will be buried . Al Qaeda gunman Mohammed Merah has today been buried outside the French city of Toulouse. A police helicopter buzzed overhead and around 100 policemen stood . guard as the serial killer was laid to rest in the Cornebarrieu . cemetery. According to reports, his body was accompanied by around 15 men whose . identities were unknown, but were said to be unrelated to the Merah. 'Nobody from the family is there, not the mother, not the brothers, . not the sisters,' Abdallah Zekri of the Muslim Council of France, who . helped organise the burial, told Le Figaro. One of the mourners told the paper: 'We came because he has the right . to be buried and accompanied by his friends like anyone else, even if . some people say he is a criminal.' The funeral comes despite Toulouse's Mayor Pierre Cohen saying it would . be 'inappropriate' to lay Merah to rest in the city where he mercilessly . gunned down four Jews and three soldiers in a two-week long terror . campaign. The government of his home country of Algeria, where today's burial had been scheduled to take place, also banned . him from being laid to rest there over 'security concerns'. And to further compound matters, French President Nicolas Sarkozy . confusingly told television reporters the 23-year-old should be allowed . to be buried in the country where he committed his crimes. The row came as French police today said they were urgently seeking a 'Third Man' who may have helped Merah murder his seven victims. His brother, Abdelkader Merah, was charged on Sunday in connection with the terrorist crimes which took place across the south west of the country this month. And, during hours of interrogation, he has admitted that another man was involved – a claim which is being backed up by growing evidence. Battle: French President Nicolas Sarkozy (centre) says Merah can be buried in the country, while Toulouse's Mayor Pierre Cohen (right) said it would be inappropriate for him to laid to rest in the city . Abdelkader, 29, said that the man was in a car with the two brothers when they bought the T-Max scooter used by Merah to travel to and from the murder scenes. ‘He has not told us the name of the man,’ said a judicial source. ‘But he is actively being sought as a matter of urgency’. Intriguingly, investigators have now discovered a stolen white Renault Clio containing parts of the motorbike and the crash helmet used Merah. The car was found abandoned some 80 miles from the council house in Toulouse where Merah was shot dead by special forces police a week ago. Arrested: Abdelkader Merah, the older brother of suspected gunman Mohammed, has indicated a third man could have been involved . If a third man is indeed still on the loose, it raises the terrifying possibility that he could still be an active terrorist preparing to strike again. Merah, who claimed to have links to Al-Qaeda, was killed after a 32-hour siege. Video footage shot by Merah shows him killing three French soldiers and four people at a Jewish school. It is currently in the hands of the Al Jazeera TV channel, but they have agreed not to broadcast it following complaints by the French government. Tragedy: Rabbi Jonathan Sandler (left) and his sons Arieh, 5, and Gabriel, 4, were gunned down. Miriam Monsonego, daughter of the school's headteacher, was also killed . It also comes as France has barred a group of Muslim clerics, including one of the most prominent voices in Sunni Islam, from entering the country to attend a conference. France's foreign ministry said today the clerics were invited by the French Islamic Union to speak next month at a congress near Paris. One of those barred, the Egyptian-born Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, says he refuses to come to France. Tensions are high in France after Merah murders. The foreign ministry said in a statement that 'these people call for hatred and violence and seriously violate the principles of the Republic, and in the current context, seriously risk disrupting public order.'",Police now hunting THIRD man who may have helped Mohammed Merah .
"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 17:32 EST, 27 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:57 EST, 27 September 2013 . English has squeezed out every other language in the competition to become the common tongue of Europe, an EU report confirmed yesterday. It found that English is the most popular foreign language in all but five European countries, and all of those are small nations that use the language of their larger neighbours. Two out of three people across the continent have at least a fair working knowledge of English. Growing and growing: Two thirds of people across the continent have at least a working knowledge of English . Not one country can be found where the preferred second language is French, once the language of international diplomacy and still the vehicle by which French governments try to promote their influence abroad. French remains the European common language only in the offices of European institutions. It is one of the three working languages of the European Commission in Brussels, alongside English and German, and the main language of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, alongside English. The report published by the EU statistics arm Eurostat suggests that the dominance of English is likely to become even greater in the future. It found that 94 per cent of secondary school pupils and 83 per cent of primary age pupils across the EU are learning English as their first foreign language, more than four times as many as learn French, German or Spanish. Only in Britain and Ireland is French the top foreign language in schools. The findings raise a series of questions about the future of languages in the EU. They will deepen criticism of the way the EU spends an estimated £1 billion a year translating all of its documents into the 23 official languages of the bloc. Understand? English has become the mother tongue in Europe . The popularity of English also opens the prospect of a difficulty if Britain should quit the EU. That would leave Brussels running a union whose real common language would be spoken as a native tongue only by the 4.6 million people of the Irish Republic - fewer than one in 100 of its population. However, the swing towards English underlines the growing problem of the decline of language teaching in British schools and universities. It suggests the motivation for learning languages among native English speakers weakens when people can speak English wherever in the world they may go. The report said: ‘The importance of English as a foreign language is confirmed among working age adults. In the EU, English was declared to be the best-known language amongst the population aged 25 to 64.’ Two thirds of adults knew English, with one in five of these saying they were proficient, 35 per cent spoke it well, and 45 per cent reckoned they had a fair command of English. The findings, taken from the large-scale EU Adult Education Survey conducted in 2011, were published to mark the European Day of Languages, an event ‘to promote the rich linguistic and cultural diversity of Europe’ and to encourage language learning. English was best known in Denmark, where 94 per cent of people speak it, and least in Italy, where 60 per cent know some English but only one in 10 people consider themselves proficient. Other languages were more widely spoken only in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, neighbours of Russia and where there are many native Russian speakers, in Luxembourg, where German is an official language, and Slovakia, where many speak Czech. English was the main language taught in schools outside the British Isles everywhere but Luxembourg, where the EU says German is a foreign language.","Two thirds of Europeans have at least working knowledge of English .

Muslims attending an event in Parliament were told to use a bar as a prayer room, despite alcohol being forbidden by the Quran. A damning complaint to Commons catering bosses also reveals staff ‘shouted’ at guests to get out with some not even given time to eat their food. It is a hugely embarrassing revelation at a time when officials are hoping to raise more money by hiring out rooms in Parliament. Blunder: Commons staff are under fire for suggesting a room usually used as a bar be set aside as a prayer room for Muslims . Alcohol is banned by Islam and some Muslims refuse to even handle it, fearing it can turn make them forget about God and prayer. But an organisation which booked a reception in the Commons was appalled to find staff had set aside a room often used as a bar for champagne receptions. The bungle was revealed after the serious complaint was revealed through a Freedom of Information request. The email reveals anger at the bar being offered as a prayer room, guests being shouted at, food being taken away before it could be eaten and no provision for kosher food from the in-house kitchens. The unnamed organisation was told to use Dining Room A, one of four overlooking the River Thames, as the prayer room. The room offered as a prayer room is regularly used as a bar for drinks receptions . The room is next door to the main Stranger’s Bar, where MPs often drink late into the night. The booking would have been made in the name of an MP. Hiring one of the rooms can cost around £750 for a few hours. The event was held on November 20 last year but was a disaster. The email stated: ‘We had requested a prayer space for our Muslim guests, and I had explained at a face-to-face meeting that the bar was not appropriate for this. ‘Nevertheless, our booking form still stated that the bar was our prayer space.’ Staff were also accused of an ‘unacceptable attitude towards guests’. The email added: ‘We did not appreciate the manner in which House of Commons staff shouted at our guests, both when instructing them to move into the room and when ordering their swift departure. ‘A warm welcome is an essential aspect of our events....so it was particularly jarring that our guests should be removed from the room without due politeness.’ Food was taken away 15 minutes before the event ended ‘with the result that some of our guests in fact did not manage to eat any breakfast at all’. ‘Our guests were then removed from the dining room five minutes before the event was due to end.’ One guest who had ‘number of allergies’ had no food prepared for her. Kosher diners had to have food ordered in from outside caterers - at an additional £10 charge per person - as catering staff could not provide kosher food. ‘In short, our experience - and we understand from recent conversations that this is an experience shared by MPs, peers and their staff - is that the Houses of Parliament does not cater at all for religious dietary requirements, and that there are in fact charges and processes which appear to discriminate against those of particular faiths.’ The event was held in one of the rooms overlooking the Terrace where MPs and peers are often seen drinking and socialising . Today the House of Commons insisted it had dealt with the complaint quickly. A spokesman said: ‘The House of Commons Banqueting team responded to the complaint by phone to ensure the issue was resolved quickly.’ She said that due to ‘sheer demand on limited facilities’, time and space were at a premium. She declined to comment on why the Muslim prayer area was placed in the bar area or to comment on staff shouting at guests and telling them to leave the function before they had time to have their breakfast. She added: ‘The House’s existing kosher food supplier was unavailable on this occasion so the customer was advised that they would be able to source their own supplier, which would incur the standard handling charge for external suppliers. ‘This charge was later refunded. The House Banqueting team has reviewed its Kosher suppliers to ensure we are able to source alternatives in the future.’","Official complaint made after appalling service at event in Parliament .

Residents of a country estate owned by an aristocrat have been forced to complain to the police after the area became a dogging hotspot. Groups of men dressed in PVC, fairy wings and tutus have been gathering in farm buildings on the Badminton Estate in Wiltshire for sordid sex parties. Now police have started regular patrols across the land, which is owned by the Duke of Beaufort, in a bid to crack down on the voyeurs. Trouble: Police have been called to the Badminton Estate after locals complained about doggers . Nick Bush, a tenant farmer who lives in the hamlet of West Kington, called officers after several unsuccessful attempts to drive the doggers away. 'On one occasion I found four bras hanging up,' he said. 'On another there were a couple of old boys who said, ""We're only here for having a bit of fun mate."" 'We get all sorts of undesirable activities other than enjoying the view. I have interrupted cars but I've never bothered to get out and remonstrate.' Mr Bush added: 'Nobody wants them in their back yard. The problem is if you shut one down they move to another.' The gatherings are believed to take place in a burned-out barn where police caught a group of men having sex last year. Country house: The estate centres on Badminton House, ancestral home of the Duke of Beaufort . Event: The estate is known for hosting the Badminton Horse Trials in the grounds of the home . Officers say there has recently been a surge of complaints from residents who are being disturbed by doggers. Sergeant Phil Connor said: 'In the last two weeks we have had complaints from numerous outraged residents about vehicles arriving at the site and the occupants engaging in sexual activity. 'We are going to be doing extensive patrols in the evenings to deter any further activity and reassure those in the community.' One woman living nearby said: 'I've seen cars pulling away late at night. I wouldn't stop there - it's quite threatening when you know what's happening. 'None of us are very happy about it. It's not very nice to think that that's going on somewhere up the road.' Home: The estate is owned by David, 11th Duke of Beaufort . Another woman, who has lived in the village for 50 years, said she regularly sees cars parked up at the site which flash their lights at her as she goes by. She said: 'It is surprising how many flash at you, perhaps that's what they do to attract other men. 'They've never caused us any harm - but they do leave a lot of rubbish.' One man added: 'You don't want that sort of thing going on in your village.' The estate centres on Badminton House in Gloucestershire, ancestral home of the duke, which is known for hosting the Badminton Horse Trial.","Residents of Badminton Estate in Wiltshire complain about local doggers .

The plane waiting to take off was filled with passengers and had £32million worth of diamonds in the hold. Three minutes later the gems were gone – all the time it needed for a gang of robbers armed with machine guns to force their way in, seize them and escape. Not a shot was fired and the passengers were apparently unaware of the drama until their flight was cancelled minutes later. Scroll down for video . Smash and grab: Armed robbers have stolen diamonds worth more than £32million as they were being loaded on to this plane at Brussels airport . Getaway: The charred remains of a van suspected to have been involved in the heist near Brussels Airport . Investigations: Police officers pictured at the scene of the heist last night . Late arrival: Security staff place barriers along the safety fence, where the armed robbers are believed to have burst through before making a beeline for the diamonds as they were being loaded onto the plane . The daring heist was carried out at Brussels airport when eight masked robbers wearing police uniforms broke through a security fence and drove on to the tarmac unchallenged in two cars with blue flashing lights. Once inside the hold they quickly located the 120 parcels of diamonds kept in a sealed container no bigger than a shoebox. It is understood that the gems had just been put on board. They had been brought to the airport in an armoured van which was still beside the Swiss plane during the robbery. Last night investigators had found the charred remains of the van most likely used in the heist but little else. Brazen: An airport spokesman said the robbers made a hole in the perimeter fence and drove up to the Swiss passenger plane, which was ready to leave, while wearing outfits that resembled police uniforms . Brazen: The gang threatened staff and seized two locked metal trunks containing the valuables as they were being loaded onto a Helvetic Airlines flight to Zurich at around 8pm on Monday night . The gang’s remarkable efficiency led to speculation last night that it could have been an inside job. They broke through the airport’s perimeter fence using a Mercedes and an Audi around 20 minutes before the Helvetic Airways plane bound for Zurich was due to take off at 8pm on Monday. They made a high-speed exit through the same hole in the fence. Because many of the diamonds were uncut, the chances of recovering them are said to be very low. They had been transported from Antwerp where eight in ten of the world’s rough diamonds are processed. Great escape: The gang used two black cars in their raid, grabbed the cache of stones and sped off into the darkness, said Anja Bijnens, spokeswoman for the Brussels prosecutor's office . On alert: A truck from the security company Brink's is seen at the airport's cargo zone after the heist . A decade ago, the Belgian city of Antwerp, the world capital of diamond-cutting, was the scene of what was probably one of the biggest diamond heists in history. Robbers took precious stones, jewels, gold and securities from the high-security vaults at Antwerp's Diamond Center, yielding loot that police in 2003 estimated to be worth about $100 million. Antwerp's Diamond Center stands in the heart of the high-surveillance diamond district where police and dozens of cameras work around the clock. Security has been beefed up further since the spectacular 2003 robbery. But it is thought the goods stolen in Monday's raid, 30 miles away in Brussels, may have belonged to those very traders who that security is trying to protect. Prosecutors would not say who owned the diamonds or what they were worth. Belgian state broadcaster VRT initially reported that the value was €350million (£300million). A spokesman for the Antwerp Diamond Centre later said the value may be closer to £32million. ‘In any case it’s one of the biggest robberies we’ve seen,’ he added. Brussels airport spokesman Jan Van Der Cruijsse could not explain how the area could be so vulnerable to theft. He said: ‘We abide by the most stringent rules.’ Philip Baum, a British aviation security consultant, said the lack of an immediate response to the security breach was concerning. He said: ‘It does seem very worrying that someone can actually have the time to drive two vehicles on to the airport, effect the robbery, and drive out without being intercepted.’ A decade ago, robbers made off with valuables estimated to be worth £50million at the time from the vaults at Antwerp Diamond Centre. In 1983, six robbers broke into the Brink’s-MAT warehouse at Heathrow and made off with gold, diamonds and cash worth £26million. Only two of the robbers were convicted and most of the gold was never recovered.

On trial: Teacher Bruce Roth, pictured outside court earlier in his trial, is accused of sexually abusing students . while working at King's School in Rochester, Kent, and Wellington . College in Berkshire . A housemaster accused of molesting boys at night at a top public school was previously a pop singer who had toured with legendary DJ Norman Cook, a court heard today. Bruce Roth, a maths teacher at £30,000-a-year Wellington College, Berks, is accused of sneaking into boys' dormitories in the middle of the night and molesting them as they lay in bed. A jury was told that Roth, a former target shooter who has taught for 23 years, had a brief pop singing career where he toured with 80's pop band The Housemartins and Everything But the Girl. The teacher worked with the Housemartins, whose members included DJ Norman Cook - aka Fat Boy Slim - while studying for a physics degree at Hull University. The 46-year-old keen singer taught maths at Wellington College in Crowthorne, Berks - where old boys include Will Young and impressionist Rory Bremner - and at Kings School in Rochester, Kent. He is standing trial accused of abusing five boys in instances dating back to 1987. Roth today fought back the tears at Reading Crown Court as he told the jury how the allegations would have a long term effect on his singing with mixed choirs. Roth, who also had competed for his country at target shooting and narrowly missed out on a place to compete in the Commonwealth Games, also told how he may struggle to regain his firearms licence. The former singer has already been suspended from his teaching job, but denies ever abusing a child in his care or being a paedophile. He claimed that money was a possible motive for the allegations being made up against him, and told the jury that the family of one of the boys planned to sue him and Wellington College for 'large amounts of money' following the case. A tearful Mr Roth told a jury today: 'I love teaching. I really miss the classroom. I miss all the activities I used to do.' Alexander Williams, defending, asked Roth whether the allegations he was facing were true. He replied: 'No they are all false.' Well-spoken Roth denied being gay, telling the jury he was 'not even bi-sexual.' Earlier in the trial the jury had . visited Wellington College, whose master is Tony Blair’s biographer . Anthony Seldon, to be shown the corridors and dorms where pupils alleged . they were abused. During . the trial, at Reading Crown Court, Berks., young men have testified that . Roth would molest them as they lay in bed at night, either in rooms or . dormitories. One said he was only eight years old when the teacher molested him at King’s School. Roth allegedly toured with both (left) The Housemartins,( clockwise from top left - Paul Heaton, Norman Cook, Dave Hemingway and Stan Cullimore) and (right) Everything But The Girl, (Ben Watt and Tracey Thorn) Roth, who has taught for 23 years, has already been suspended from his job at the prestigious Wellington College in Crowthorne, Berks . His alleged activities with the five boys came to light when one of the former pupils contacted the charity Childline. The publicity surrounding the ensuing police investigation then prompted others to come forward and report allegedly  being abused by him. Roth, whose address cannot be published by order of the court, denies four charges of indecent assault on a male person under 16, four counts of sexual activity with a child, three counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and six counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust.

Criminal gangs are using Poland as a base for smuggling under-age prostitutes, professional benefit cheats and sham brides into Britain. Concerns that the country has become a ‘hotspot’ for people-smuggling operations mean that officers from the new National Crime Agency will be based in Poland for the first time. They have been given instructions to hunt down the gangmasters responsible before their victims can reach our shores. Revelation: Concerns over criminal gangs using Poland as a base for people-smuggling have meant officers from the National Crime Agency will be based in the country for the first time (picture posed by models) Poland is one of five ‘priority’ countries identified by the Home Office and the NCA. Vietnam, China, Albania and Nigeria will also have UK police bases. The former Eastern bloc country is attractive for gangs trying to bring in under-age prostitutes and other sex workers because of its EU membership – granting its citizens full access to the UK. It is also at the heart of other scams, . such as sending Polish women to the UK to take part in ‘sham weddings’ to non-EU citizens they have never even met. Bill: Theresa May will publish a new law targeting sex traffickers, people smugglers and gangmasters later this year . As a result of Poland’s EU status, marrying a Polish woman gives the migrant permission to remain in the UK. Poles are also forced to make fraudulent benefit claims, then hand the money over to gangs controlling them. A warning by the US Department of State, which compiles reports on countries across the globe, said: ‘Poles are brought to the United Kingdom by an organised crime group and subsequently coerced to commit crimes, such as benefits fraud. There have been cases of Polish men and women being fraudulently recruited to work or get married abroad and then forced or induced to traffic drugs by crime groups.’ The NCA begins operating next month, replacing the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the CEOP child protection agency and some functions of the UK’s border force. Ministers are determined to focus its efforts on securing the nation’s borders and tackling what Home Secretary Theresa May calls ‘modern-day slavery’. The NCA Border Policing Command will have 400 officers working at ports and airports across the country looking for drugs, firearms and immigration offenders. It will also run a network of 120 officers around the world to tackle threats before they reach the UK. David Armond, director of the NCA’s Border Policing Command, said: ‘This move will help explode the myth that people trafficked across the border against their will are somehow immigration criminals – this is organised crime and that is what the NCA is set up to tackle.’ Joint Border Intelligence Units consisting of 75 NCA officers and colleagues from the Border Force will be set up at ports and airports. They will share intelligence with the police, including Special Branch, immigration enforcement and HMRC. The Bulgarian government has accused Britons of being workshy and addicted to benefits. It says the UK needs East European immigrants to do jobs such as seasonal fruit picking because its nationals are not willing to work hard enough, according to a document submitted to the Home Office. Employers are having difficulty recruiting British workers because ‘they either cannot or will not work at the intensity required to earn the agricultural minimum wage and have little incentive to come off social security benefits’, it said. The report was part of the Government’s assessment of the benefits of Romanian and Bulgarian workers ahead of the expected influx of economic migrants from next January. Downing Street is seeking to renegotiate the laws that allow the free movement of  EU nationals. Bulgaria denied its citizens were ‘benefit tourists’ seeking to exploit the welfare state. Officials say this will ensure that suspicious freight consignments and passengers coming into the country will be identified more effectively and stopped from travelling, as well as controlling who gets their hands on British passports and visas. Later this year, Mrs May will publish a new law targeting sex traffickers, people smugglers and gangmasters. Those convicted of using abduction, threats or extortion to control people would face sentences of up to 14 years. The Bill will also introduce trafficking prevention orders to prevent those convicted of involvement in the slave trade from resuming their criminal activities. They would restrict a gangmaster’s ability to own a company, work with children and young women and visit specified places or areas. The orders would be enforced through the use of a blacklist circulated to all ports and police forces. A Home Office spokesman said yesterday: ‘The NCA’s Border Policing Command will strengthen the UK’s ability to crack down on the trafficking of people, weapons and drugs at the border. ‘It will work with the Border Force, police and HMRC to ensure that for the first time all law enforcement agencies in and around our border are working together to cut cross-border crime. ‘Previously, opportunities to link investigations and develop intelligence may have been missed.’","National Crime Agency will have a base in Poland for the first time .

Bode Miller mastered the Olympic course on his very first run on Thursday, leading the opening downhill training session. The U.S. skier, who won a bronze medal in the event four years ago, was cheered on by his wife, volleyball player, Morgan Beck, at the base of the Rosa Khutor run. His one-year-old son, Nate, is in New York with his mother, Sara McKenna, but it is presumed he will be joining Miller and his wife in Sochi after a temporary custody agreement with McKenna determined he could go to Russia. But on the slopes on Thursday, Miller's thoughts were on clocking the best time; the 36-year-old came in at 2 minutes and 7.75 seconds, giving him the top spot for the training run. Scroll down for video . Winner: U.S. skier Bode Miller, pictured preparing for downhill training in Sochi on Thursday, mastered the course and came in with the fastest time - 2 minutes, 7.75 seconds . Strong: He has come back from an injured knee, which forced him to take an entire season off . 'Unfortunately they don't give you medals . for training runs,' Miller said. 'If they did, I would be psyched . today. But it certainly doesn't hurt to come out here and ski well first . run. I just have to keep trimming time.' Patrick Kueng of Switzerland, who won the classic downhill in Wengen on home snow last month, was second, a slim 0.03 seconds behind. Matthias Mayer of Austria was third, 0.17 behind. Marco Sullivan of the U.S. was fourth, although he was one of several skiers who missed gates. Italy's Christof Innerhofer was fifth, 0.69 behind, and should be a contender on the course. Miller, who has indicated this could be his last Olympics, cut his 2011-12 season short after an injury in Sochi and had microfracture surgery. He took all of last season off to let his knee properly heel. He faced trouble in his personal life too - losing his younger brother Nathaniel, who died of a seizure last April, and struggling through a custody battle after learning McKenna was pregnant. Support: His wife Morgan Beck, who shared this image online, was at the event to cheer for him . Together: The couple are pictured together at the men's World Cup downhill in Austria last month . Miller and McKenna had a brief . relationship in 2012 in California after meeting on a high-end dating website and after they went on a few dates, McKenna discovered she was pregnant. But Miller, who also has a five-year-old daughter from another relationship, had already started dating volleyball player Morgan Beck, and after five months they married. The case became a . cause for women's rights advocates after a judge castigated McKenna for . moving while pregnant to New York. She's a former marine and firefighter now studying at Columbia . University. As they battled with the courts, his wife Morgan fell pregnant - but suffered a miscarriage soon after. McKenna has had temporary custody of the boy, whom Miller calls Nate but whom McKenna calls Sam, since . November while Miller was away in Canada and Colorado seeking to qualify. On his way: It is believed that Miller will be joined by his son Nate, pictured together last year, in Sochi after winning a temporary custody order in December that allows the one-year-old to go to Russia . Adorable: Morgan shared a photo of baby Nate relaxing next to his dad on a private plane last year . Dispute: Nate's mother is Sara McKenna, a former Marine who met Miller on a dating website in 2012. They have been involved in a long custody battle since the baby's birth last February . But at the end of the year, McKenna and Miller hammered out the details of a temporary custody agreement in place until at least a March 31 court date. It also allows him to take his son to Sochi. After the struggles - both professionally and personally - Miller seemingly regained his form and finished second in a World Cup giant slalom in December. Then he had two podium results on the famed Streif course in Kitzbuehel, Austria, last month. But last weekend he banged up his right knee during a crash in a giant slalom in St. Moritz, Switzerland. 'It's still puffed up a little bit and a little bit sore,' Miller said. 'There's nothing wrong with it, just got banged hard.' Consequently, Miller was a bit tentative on the Sochi course's biggest jump, labeled the Russian Trampoline, which comes midway down. Spat: Miller, with his wife left and Nate right, now has temporary custody of the boy until the end of March . No rest: Morgan shared a photo of her heading to the gym before her husband's training run . 'It's really bumpy and rattley,' he said of the icy landing area. 'That's one of the places where I went way out in the soft snow.' Overall, though, Miller was pleased to see that the course hadn't been altered much since the 2012 test event, in which several other skiers were also injured. 'They didn't dumb it down much, which is nice,' said Miller, who finished fourth in the test downhill. 'They didn't ice the top, which is understandable - the turns are huge up there. The swing and turns would make it very tough for guys on top if it were icy. It would be better for me but that's fine. I still feel like I have the ability to ski that top and put time on guys. 'But once you come out of the chute all the way down they didn't take anything away. The speeds are up, the terrain is challenging and the jumps are big. Fighter: Miller (pictured Thursday) suffered a knee injury on the course in 2012. His events start on Sunday . 'There's a lot of different places where you can make mistakes and where it's really challenging - especially linking sections together.' The training session was held in perfect conditions, under a bright sun and clear skies. The snow was grippy on top, icier in the middle section and softer at the bottom where the temperature was above the freezing. All 61 racers who started reached the finish. Two more training sessions are scheduled before Sunday's race opens the Alpine events.","Miller clocked 2 minutes, 7.75 seconds during a training session on Thursday on the Rosa Khutor piste - where he previously suffered an injury .

The world's oldest home audio recordings to be made on Christmas Day more than a century ago have been discovered by a grandfather — in his attic. David Brown, 71, was given a phonograph and wax cylinders containing audio recordings by his mum when she died, but had no idea what was on them, as the recording machine was broken. He stashed the recordings in his loft and only re-discovered them later during a clear-out. He donated them to the Museum of London four years ago, where experts made the remarkable discovery.

The phonograph was invented by Thomas Edison and worked by capturing sounds through a huge horn. A stylus then pressed these sound impressions into a wax cylinder . The extremely rare collection of recordings captures Mr Brown's middle-class family enjoying Christmas in north London in the early 1900s, with clear audio of speeches and songs. One recording from Christmas Day 1902 captures the whole Victorian family singing Angels from the Realms of Glory and We Wish You a Merry Christmas. The 24 two-minute recordings have been studied by experts at the Museum of London, and are believed to include the earliest surviving audio of Christmas time in the world. 'It is absolutely incredible to hear the voices of my ancestors from over one hundred years ago,' said Mr Brown, from Hail Weston, Cambridgeshire.

'There was lots of chatting and singing at this particular Christmas party, and everybody spoke very well. 'You can hear them making speeches and singing hymns. They were a very church-based family.' Mr . Brown is the son of Muriel Brown, the second youngest of the Wall . children. Her family made the recordings at Christmas and New Year . gatherings between 1902 and 1914. Cromwell Wall also wheeled the phonograph along the street in his children's pram in order to record the sound of Old Southgate Church bells peeling in the New Year of 1904 . Experts have now finally managed to transfer the recordings into digital format. 'Music, chatter and laughter can be . heard on these wonderful recordings, which are bursting with vibrancy . and life,' said Julia Hoffbrand, curator of social and working history . at the Museum of London. 'It is extremely unusual for wax phonograph cylinders, containing retrievable recordings of this age, to survive — which is what makes this discovery so exciting. 'Another feature that makes these domestic recordings special is the fact that phonographs were created for use in offices as dictating machines and cylinders would usually be wiped and reused. 'Wax cylinders were very fragile, so those used for home recording were rarely kept, as they were easily damaged. 'On hearing some of the musical recordings, classical music experts have commented that the sound quality is outstanding — superior to many musical recordings made for sale at the time.' The Wall family, including Mr Brown's grandparents and great-grandparents, lived in Southgate, North London. Mr Brown's grandfather, Cromwell Wall, was responsible for making the recordings of his family, who were extremely musical and very active in the church. The recordings include Cromwell's sister Ellis Wall playing a piano solo at home, and the Wall and Baker families addressing the phonograph with their Christmas greetings amid cheers and laughter. Aside from recording at home, Cromwell Wall also wheeled the phonograph along the street in his children's pram in order to record the sound of Old Southgate Church bells peeling in the New Year of 1904. The family included Cromwell's wife and nine children, plus his father William Wall, who came to London from Somerset to make his fortune — he co-founded the major engineering firm Biggs, Wall & Co.

'Once you had finished with one recording, you could scrape the wax off and record again,' said Mr Brown.

Residents of Fort Hood in Texas were a part of military history earlier this month when a convoy of trucks drove through the small town. Although this convoy looked like the usual stream of trucks that often passes through the area, there was one notable omission - drivers. Each of the trucks in the convoy were part of an autonomous fleet of vehicles being tested by the U.S. Army, with the hope they will one day be deployed to urban battle areas. Scroll down for video . The U.S. Army teamed up with Lockheed Martin to test a convoy of autonomous vehicles in Fort Hood, Texas, pictured. Each of the driverless tactical vehicles were tested on their abilities to navigate hazards and obstacles including road intersections, oncoming traffic, pedestrians and traffic circles . Called the Unmanned Mission Module, the technology used in the recent Fort Hood tests included a high performance LIDAR sensor - or laser radar. This remote sensing technology is capable . of scanning the road ahead and measuring distances by illuminating a . target with a laser, and analysing the light that is reflected. The module is also fitted with a GPS receiver to plan, and track the convoy’s route. Google's self-driving cars use similar sensors and technologies to navigate through towns and cities.

After her triumph in the movie Les Miserables, Anne Hathaway has got the singing bug. The actress, front-runner to win the best supporting Oscar for her indescribably sublime Les Mis performance, is having a number specially written for her in a new film that she will shoot later in the year called Song One. In the movie, she will play an archaeologist who falls for a rock star — to be played by British singer-actor Johnny Flynn. They meet when Hathaway’s character returns to the US from a dig in Morocco, when her brother is injured. Flynn plays the brother’s favourite musician and, well, I won’t give the whole plot away but you can see where it’s going. In real life, Flynn fronts folk band Johnny Flynn And The Sussex Wit. Johnathan Rice and Jenny Lewis are writing songs for Flynn to perform, but one track will be reserved for Hathaway. The film’s been written by Kate Barker-Froyland, who will also direct. It will shoot on locations in the US in the autumn and Hathaway’s husband Adam Shulman will be one of the producers. The actress had been expected to star in Steven Spielberg’s Robopocalypse, which was to have filmed in London next month, but it has been put back till next year at the earliest, for more budget and pre-production work. Another project on Hathaway’s mind is My Fair Lady. When I spoke to her Wednesday night, at a cocktail party Vanity Fair magazine hosted for Les Miserables, she told me she’d had exploratory conversations a couple of years ago about doing My Fair Lady on stage — and possibly on screen. If she did a theatre version it could well be with Dominic West, who was in a splendid production in Sheffield recently, while the film could be with Colin Firth. ‘I haven’t heard for a while what’s happening with My Fair Lady,’ she said, ‘and I don’t know whether I would do it on stage, or screen, but either would be a treat.’ Stage ready: Although she has got her crowd-clap perfected, Anne's new rocker project is for the big screen where she plays an archeologist who falls for a musician . I notice that record producer Clive Davis told a US newspaper that he’d like to offer Hathaway the chance to do My Fair Lady on Broadway. But he might have to get past Cameron Mackintosh first. Mackintosh would like to do a My Fair Lady revival in the West End in a couple of years and, of course, he has just worked with Hathaway on Les Mis. Mackintosh has also been planning a movie of the Alan Jay Lerner-Frederick Loewe show for a while, and hired Emma Thompson to write a screenplay. But there are complex rights issues involving copyright returning to the family of the creators, and other convoluted licensing matters that are being painstakingly resolved. I would need the pages of a book to explain but, essentially, Hathaway won’t be dancing all night just yet. Theatre wizard: Susan Stroman, director of The Scottsboro Boys . Around this time three years ago, I stopped off in New York on the way home from the Oscars to see a show called The Scottsboro Boys by John Kander and Fred Ebb, directed by that musical theatre wonder woman Susan Stroman. It was playing downtown at the Vineyard Theatre and I knew a little bit about the nine boys, aged between 12 and 19, who were put on trial in 1931 for the alleged rape of two white women in Alabama — even though one woman recanted her statement and it was obvious the other woman’s testimony was a fabrication. I caught a preview and was initially outraged that Kander and Ebb had chosen to present the story almost like a minstrel show with black actors playing white characters. But I stuck with it, and all became clear. The production knocked me for six. I . couldn’t speak as I sat in my seat, weeping, furious at the injustices . those nine young boys had endured. It remains one of the most stunning . pieces of theatre I have ever seen. Well, . The Scottsboro Boys is coming to London. David Lan, the Young Vic’s . artistic director, has been after it for years and Ms Stroman — the . force behind The Producers, Crazy For You and others — will direct and . choreograph. Performances begin at the Young Vic on October 18. ‘It . seemed proper that we remembered them again,’ Stroman told me on Monday . in New York. ‘It was a terrible mark on American history.’ She . made the point that the boys’ names were never widely known and she, . along with Kander, Ebb and book writer David Thompson, were ‘determined . to bring them to life, as individuals’. Stroman had worked with Kander . and Ebb, the creators of shows such as Cabaret and Chicago, before. But . Ebb died before the project could be finished, and Stroman assumed the . show would be dropped. ‘But John Kander didn’t want to let it go,’ David Lan, of the Young Vic, said. He was determined to finish it — and see it on stage. Stroman acknowledged that the minstrel show was a racist art form, popular in the US in the Thirties. But she observed that newsreels of the day said the trial was ‘like watching a minstrel show’. And the startling format — with only one white actor in the cast — allows the show to make a searing comment on race relations today. I’m sure that some (like me) will find it controversial, initially, but it’s going to be quite something. And the only staging is chairs that are used as a train, a cell and, devastatingly, an electric chair. Casting will be a mixture of US and UK actors. Julianne Moore and Kirsten Dunst were among those at a private L.A. showcase of Bulgari jewels once owned by Elizabeth Taylor. We had to troop upstairs at the Bulgari store on North Rodeo Drive to see the stunning diamond and emerald pieces. There was a diamond ring on display that Elizabeth wore when I sang to her at one of her birthday parties. Bulgari bling: Kirsten Dunst and Julianne Moore dazzle at the showcase of Elizabeth Taylor's Bvlgari jewelry . Richard Burton bought most of the beautiful baubles, and Bulgari purchased them back  from the actress’s estate when she died. Burton is quoted as saying: ‘I introduced her to beer, she introduced me to Bulgari.’ He added: ‘The only word Elizabeth knows in Italian is Bulgari.’ Helena Bonham Carter should pay a visit while she’s in LA. The star is portraying Elizabeth in a BBC drama called Burton And Taylor. She won’t be impersonating Taylor — rather she’ll be attempting to capture the essence of her. Dominic West will play Burton. Charles Finch’s pre-Bafta bash with . Chanel was such a hit that his Oscar dinner tomorrow night at . Madeo in Los Angeles is over-subscribed, with everyone who’s anyone .

Finch, very wickedly, sent me a couple of last-minute excuses doing the rounds. ‘I am only going if Gerard Butler is going. And I want to sit next to him.’ Followed by...‘Promise me Gerry Butler isn’t going.’ How cruel. Mr Butler isn’t on the list.

A gang of Eastern Europeans were yesterday found guilty of subjecting girls as young as 12 to horrific sexual abuse. Two adults and three boys were convicted of rape and sexual assault in what prosecutors described as one of the worst cases they had ever seen. A court heard how the group, of Czech, Slovak and Kurdish origin, groomed five vulnerable girls between 12 and 14 and then abused them in a range of locations, including near a playground, in 2012. Zdeno Mirga and Hassan Abdulla, who were both convicted of rape . Eighteen-year-old Zdeno Mirga, described by one girl as the ‘boss’, was convicted of eight counts of rape and one count of inciting child prostitution following a trial at the Old Bailey. One of his victims told how Mirga would take her to parties and ‘share’ her for money to buy vodka and cannabis. Angela Rafferty, prosecuting, told the court: ‘He encouraged her, often very forcefully indeed, to give others sex. He did this using the power he had over her at the time, or threatened her, and sometimes he used violence against her.’ A child sex gang has been found guilty at the Old Bailey of a series of rapes against five vulnerable girls . Hassan Abdulla, 33, was convicted of four rapes and three counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Two boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were convicted of various counts of rape and sexual assault. A third was found guilty of sexual activity with a child, but cleared of rape. The Crown Prosecution Service said the case was one of the worst examples of child sex abuse it had ever seen. The court had earlier heard how a 13-year-old victim was forced to perform sex acts on up to ten attackers in a park as one urged: ‘Rape her.’ A team of interpreters were brought in to work on the case, which lasted two and a half months. Judge John Bevan QC said: ‘Because some of the defendants do not speak good enough English, despite having lived here a long time, three interpreters have worked full time during this case, at a cost of over £30,000.’ The judge will sentence the gang, from Peterborough, on February 20. Speaking after yesterday’s verdicts, detective superintendent Gary Ridgway of Cambridgeshire Police said: ‘These girls were targeted simply because they were vulnerable. They were seen as easy targets and exploited by this group of teenage boys and men who abused them for their own sexual gratification. ‘The victims, who were as young as 12, were subjected to horrific ordeals. But they have shown incredible strength throughout this process – in particular by giving evidence at court in order to bring these people to justice. We are committed to helping those girls pick up the pieces and move on with their lives.’ The Home Affairs Select committee has called on the Government to introduce special courts to ensure child sex attackers are brought to justice. It discovered that some victims found the trial of their abusers more harrowing than their crimes, following marathon cross-examinations by teams of aggressive defence barristers. Investigation: Peterborough City Council said it had called for a serious case review . The latest case comes after seven Oxford men, mostly of Pakistani heritage, were convicted at the Old Bailey last year of running a paedophile sex ring. That trial had followed another, almost exactly 12 months earlier, concerning nine Asian men based in Rochdale. Peterborough has seen a sizeable influx of immigrants in the past ten years, leading to racial tensions in the city. The 2011 census revealed that only 70.9 per cent of the population was white British, compared with 85.7 per cent ten years earlier. In 2001, shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks, 17-year-old Ross Parker was murdered by a group of Muslim youths in the city, in what the judge described at the trial as a ‘racist killing’. Extra police officers were called in to patrol the city centre in May 2004 following four nights of violent clashes between Pakistani, Afghan and Iraqi men which left homes damaged and cars on fire. Two months later, a festival organised by the city’s Indian community to celebrate diversity ended in more violence as Pakistani and Iraqi groups clashed.","Zdeno Mirga was described by one victim as the 'boss'

A city council has created a guide to teach migrants how to behave in an apparent bid to ease tensions in the community. The leaflet, drafted by Sheffield City Council, warns new arrivals, including Roma, against a slew of offensive habits - including urinating, defecating, spitting or having sex in the street - that upset locals. It also contains instructions on claiming benefits and other taxpayer-funded services like healthcare and accessing translators. There is advice on 'being a good neighbour', urging migrants not to dump litter in a neighbour's garden or allow their children to play there, hang washing on their fence and not to block drains with soiled nappies. Sheffield City Council produced a guide on anti-social behaviour, which follows the influx of migrants, including Roma. Pictured are Ivan Kandrac, Marian Sandor and Dalibor Ziga in the Page Hall area of the city. They were pictured for an earlier, unrelated, article . Bizarrely, it also instructs them on how British people usually clean their rugs and carpets and recommends buying or hiring a vaccum cleaner and a shampooing machine. The city has been riven by racial tension, especially in the Page Hall area, and fear of civil unrest is growing.  To make matters worse there are the first signs of vigilante action against the new Roma arrivals. Some residents with strong views about their new neighbours have begun patrolling the streets at night to ‘gather evidence’ of anti-social behaviour and possible criminal activity. In addition, the local Pakistani community association is running ‘official’ warden patrols between 8pm and 10pm every weekday with the intention of ‘educating’ the Roma population about ‘how to behave in England’. Outspoken: Local Pakistani Kashmir Malik has expressed the thoughts of many on their new Roma neighbours . Tempers flaring: The dispute becomes more heated as Mr Sandor is confronted by Andrew Harra, 63 . Sheffield City Council defended their work with migrants and said the guide will not be released. A spokesman said: 'Sheffield has a proud tradition of welcoming people from a large number of backgrounds and has done for many, many years. As a council we don’t take a view who should be in this country or not. 'We give advice to all people visiting or living in the city. This includes more than 55,000 students who come here.' Warning: Mr Blunkett, the former Labour Home Secretary, has warned the increased Roma presence could spark riots . 'We have not released this document at all and it is not something which we ever agreed as a council to be used as a leaflet or otherwise.' The leaflet, which was leaked to the Daily Express, also contains advice on raising children, saying: 'Babies and young children should never be left at home alone.' Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance blasted the unpublished guide as a waste of public money. He said: 'Spending taxpayers’ money on this frankly ludicrous guide is not only a waste of money, but there is also a danger it would exacerbate problems caused when communities do not integrate. 'Councils should not be encouraging the use of interpreters for those wishing to access public services. 'It’s vital that those coming to Britain are able to speak the language and interact with existing communities before they arrive, rather than taxpayers footing an extra burden for this kind of nonsense guide.' Alp Mehmet, vice chair of Migrationwatch UK, a non-governmental body that monitors immigration, said: 'It's pitiful state of affairs that we have had to resort to this. 'If they think they can stop the problem by producing leaflets I've got news for them: It won't. 'I can see why they feel the need to do something about it and you can't blame them for trying.' Just weeks ago former home secretary David Blunkett warned British cities could be hit by rioting because of an influx of Roma migrants. Mr Blunkett called on Roma migrants from Slovakia to ‘change their culture’ because their dumping of rubbish and refusal to send their children to school had caused ‘understandable tensions’ with residents in Sheffield. Britain is home to more than 200,000 Roma migrants, most of them from Eastern Europe. The former Home Secretary said ‘frictions’ with local people could lead to race riots. ‘If everything exploded, if things went wrong, the community would obviously be devastated,’ Mr Blunkett said. Mr Blunkett claimed that the cultural gulf between the community in Sheffield and the Roma was far greater than that between white Britons and Pakistani immigrants. Unusual: Slightly more odd is the guide's advice for cleaning carpets . He said: ‘The Roma youngsters have come from a background even more different culturally, because they were living in the edge of woods, not going to school, not used to the norms of everyday life. We’ve got to change that.’ Mr Blunkett said locals were entitled to ‘grumble’ about the large influx of migrants from Roma communities, but they should not ‘stir up hate’. ‘I wouldn’t want other people to put up with things I wouldn’t put up with myself,’ he said. ‘This is nothing to do with criticising people about being racist. 'By all means grumble, but don’t stir up hate.'","City chiefs produced leaflets on behaviour for migrants, but won't release it .

The Milky Way’s black hole is about to gobble up its first dinner, and astronomers are hoping to have front row seats when it happens. A huge gas cloud, about three times the mass of Earth, is on course to collide with the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy in March. Astronomers expect the gas cloud will swing so close to the black hole that it will heat up to the point where it produces spectacular X-rays. Scroll down for videos... A huge gas cloud, about three times the mass of Earth, is on course to collide with the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy in March. Pictured here is a simulation of how the gas cloud might appear after close approach to the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way . The gas cloud, dubbed G2, was first discovered by astronomers in Germany in 2011. They expected it to hit the black hole, called Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star by astronomers), late last year. That didn't happen, but the cloud continues to drift closer. Astronomers now predict that the impact will occur in the next few months. When it does, the X-rays produced from the impact could help scientists understand how black holes eat matter and shed light on the evolution of galaxy. The galactic center as imaged by the Swift X-ray Telescope. This image is a montage of all data obtained in the monitoring programme from 2006-2013 . Sagittarius A* lurks 26,000 light years . away in the Milky Way's innermost region. Even for a black hole, it is very dim - . about a billion times fainter than others of its supermassive types - . making it something of a mystery. Black holes eat matter from their surroundings and blow matter back. The way they do that influences the evolution of the entire galaxy. The . collision will give astronomers a unique opportunity to see how faint . supermassive black holes feed. They hope to understand these black holes don't consume matter in the same way as their brighter counterparts . in other galaxies. The findings could shed light on how stars are formed, how the galaxy grows and how it interacts with other galaxies. ‘Astronomers around the world are eagerly awaiting the first sign that this interaction has begun,’ said Jamie Kennea, a team member at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. Scientists saw what they thought was a sign in April, when Nasa’s Swift telescope detected a powerful high-energy burst and a dramatic rise in the X-ray brightness of the Sagittarius A* region. They were excited to discover the activity came from separate source very near the black hole:  a rare subclass of neutron star. A neutron star is the crushed core of a star destroyed by a supernova explosion, packing the equivalent mass of a half-million Earths into a sphere no wider than Washington. The neutron star, named SGR J1745-29, is a magnetar, meaning its magnetic field is thousands of times stronger than an average neutron star. Only 26 magnetars have been identified to date. The discovery of SGR J1745-29 may aid scientists in their exploration of important properties of the Sagittarius A* black hole. Black holes eat matter from their surroundings and blow matter back. The way they do that influences the evolution of the entire galaxy—how stars are formed, how the galaxy grows, how it interacts with other galaxies. Sagittarius A* lurks 26,000 light years away in the Milky Way's innermost region. For a black hole it is dim - about a billion times fainter than others of its supermassive types - making it something of a mystery. The collision will give astronomers a unique opportunity to see how faint supermassive black holes, such as the Milky Way’s, feed and perhaps why they don't consume matter in the same way as their brighter counterparts in other galaxies. Black holes eat matter from their surroundings and blow matter back. The way they do that influences the evolution of the entire galaxy . Black holes themselves are invisible and don't permit light to escape, the material falling into them shines in X-rays. While astronomers expect to see a change in brightness, they don't know how dramatic it will be because they aren't sure exactly what the gaseous G2 object is. If it's all gas, the region would glow in the X-ray band for years to come as the black hole slowly swallows the cloud. Another possibility is that G2 could be shrouding an old star. If that's the case, the display would be less spectacular as Sagittarius A* slurped from the cloud while the star slipped by, dense enough to fight its grasp. ‘I would be delighted if Sagittarius A* suddenly became 10,000 times brighter. However it is possible that it will not react much—like a horse that won't drink when led to water,’ said Jon Miller, a University of Michigan associate professor of astronomy. ‘If Sagittarius A* consumes some of G2, we can learn about black holes accreting at low levels—sneaking midnight snacks. It is potentially a unique window into how most black holes in the present-day universe accrete.’","The gas cloud, named G2, is due to collide with the black hole in March .

Now the bold political move has sparked a war of words among Taylor's Airport Rd, Pendleton, neighbors who believe the protest is sacrilegious. 'He's a communist Muslim': Larry Taylor is flying the U.S. flag upside down to protest President Barack Obama, pictured, who he describes as a 'communist' Taylor, 71, told East Oregonian he and his wife Carol, 73, . haven’t liked President Barack Obama since he came into . office in 2008. About a month ago, they began flying the flag upside down in a move generally considered bad flag etiquette.

'We have a fraud in the White House that is a communist Muslim,' Taylor said. 'I think that constitutes a nation in distress.' Protest: Protestors fly flags upside down to signal political dissatisfaction, although it was traditionally done by ships in distress . The Taylors said they've been bombarded with calls and complaints from their neighbors, including Brad Wahl. Wahl, who serves in the Army National Guard, said  he first noticed the flag on his way to work at the Eastern Oregon Regional Airport, and thought someone accidentally hoisted it incorrectly. The 37-year-old was shocked to discover is was intentional. He said he might agree with Larry Taylor’s politics but not the method of protest. 'To me, there are certain things that . are sacred,' Wahl told East Oregonian. 'To me, the flag is one of the things that . people should hold with a little more regard.' He said the upside-down flag was a way . ships at sea or forts under attack could show they needed help, but that . went out of fashion with new technology. But Taylor, who claims he served in the U.S. Air Force at Homestead Air Reserve Base on the south tip of Florida from 1960-64 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, said he would prefer to fly the flag the right way. He promised that wouldn’t happen while Obama was in power.","Larry Taylor is flying the U.S. flag upside down over his Oregon home to show his 'distress' at the Obama presidency .

The police unit at the centre of the Plebgate scandal was rocked by fresh controversy last night as it emerged officers are suspected of exchanging ‘extreme pornography’. Four officers in Scotland Yard’s elite diplomatic protection group are under investigation after shocking images were apparently found on mobile phones. Three were arrested and a fourth was interviewed under caution in the latest blow to hit the beleaguered unit. Claims: Downing Street police (not pictured) are accused of swapping extreme porn on their phones . The images were discovered during the exhaustive £250,000 internal investigation into the controversial Andrew Mitchell affair, known as Operation Alice. Every officer in the diplomatic protection group, which is responsible for securing Downing Street and other diplomatic addresses, was questioned. It is understood the images, described as of an ‘extreme sexual nature’ but not involving children, were found during forensic analysis of mobile phones. One officer has been suspended and three others placed on restricted duties while a file has been passed to prosecutors for consideration. Probe: The pornography came to light during the investigation into the 'Plebgate' controversy . At the centre of the misconduct . investigation is the question of whether the images were exchanged while . the officers were on or off duty. The revelations pile fresh embarrassment on the force, just days after another officer from the unit was jailed for 12 months for lying over Plebgate. Keith Wallis, 53, falsely claimed to have witnessed the clash between Mr Mitchell, then The Tory chief whip, and a colleague who was on duty at the Downing Street gates. Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe apologised to the senior politician, and the public, this week saying officers must uphold the highest standards of integrity. He added: ‘Where officers break the law they must expect to be held to account and answer for what they have done.’ The three officers were arrested on December 19 on suspicion of being involved in the possession and distribution of obscene images via mobile phones. The offence carries a maximum penalty of three years’ jail. The officers were taken to a Central London police station to be questioned and search warrants executed at their homes. On January 8, a fourth officer was interviewed under caution ‘in connection with the investigation’ and placed on restricted duties. The Met referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) which ordered it to investigate the matter itself. A Met spokesman declined to discuss why the force had not revealed the investigation or arrests until contacted by The Times newspaper.","Officers guarding Downing Street are accused of exchanging images of an 'extreme sexual nature'

The police have been urged to investigate gaffe-prone Labour MP Jack Dromey after branding a postman ‘pikey’. Labour insiders were furious when the shadow police minister, who is married to deputy leader Harriet Harman, posted the controversial caption with a photo of himself with Royal Mail staff on Twitter. Tory MP David Morris tonight wrote to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe claiming it was an 'incident that may constitute incitement to racial hatred' and asking him to launch an inquiry. Offensive: Labour MP Jack Dromey faced criticism after referring to Royal Mail employee Gareth Martin as 'the Pikey' in a tweet . Mr Dromey has fallen foul of social media before and just last month he was left red-faced after it emerged he added a Twitter link to a gay porn website to his list of ‘favourites’. In the latest web blunder he attracted . criticism online after writing: ‘With Gareth Martin, the Pikey from the . Erdington Royal Mail Sorting Office. A great guy!’ Since 2007 it has been possible to be arrested for a racially aggravated offence for using the word ‘pikey’, which is an offensive word used to refer to Irish travellers. After facing a storm of criticism online, Mr Dromey moved to insist that it was a nickname used by Mr Martin’s colleagues who had named him after a Dad’s Army character. But Labour party insiders condemned a ‘stupid choice of words’. It is especially embarrassing because Ms Harman is a long-standing campaigner on equality and political-correctness. Tense: Mr Dromey is married to deputy Labour party Leader Harriet Harman . After posting the controversial message, Mr Dromey was bombarded with criticism from other Twitter users. HammyWheel wrote: ‘Disgraceful incitement to racial hatred there? “Pikey” is a horrid thing to call anyone. Expect a knock on your door from Plod.’ Guy Birchall added: ‘Worse than calling a policeman a pleb. Disgustingly insulting behaviour!’ Melindi Scott simply added: ‘Raaaaaaaaaaaacist’ After the backlash, Mr Dromey insisted he had used the racially-loaded word because it was used by Royal Mail staff. In a later tweet he wrote: ‘Don’t panic, Mr Mainwaring. This morning’s meeting was with Gareth, a Postie nicknamed after Corporal Pike from Dad’s Army.’ Nickname: Mr Dromey insisted that Royal Mail staff used the name 'Pikey' in reference to Private Pike (right) who featured in 1970s sitcom Dad's Army alongside Captain Mainwaring . Iin his letter to the head of the Met, Mr Morris claimed he had received a number of complaints about the tweet from members of the traveller community in his Morecambe and Lunesdale seat. Mr Morris wrote: 'As I am sure that you are aware, the word ""pikey"" is a deeply offensive word, and is a racially charged term due to its association with Irish travellers and Roma gypsies. 'I have received a number of complaints from members of the travelling community in my constituency, and am writing on their behalf. 'Crown Prosecution Service guidance as you know states that an ""offence is committed when the accused person says or does something which is threatening, abusive or insulting and, by doing so, either intends to stir up racial hatred, or makes it likely that racial hatred will be stirred up"". 'Mr Dromey is not only a high profile politician, but is also Shadow Minister for Policing. His tweets reach a wide audience, and he is in a position of some authority. 'I would be very grateful if you could investigate this incident as a matter of urgency.' Letter: Tory MP David Morris, who has asked the police to investigate the tweet, spent the day with Prime Minister David Cameron . A Royal Mail spokesperson said the term ‘Pikey’ was not commonly used in its sorting offices. She said: ‘I can confirm there is no such slang term for a role within Royal Mail delivery offices.’ A Labour party source said: ‘This is his nickname. It was a stupid choice of words. He should have realised that it could be open to misinterpretation and when he did, he clarified it. ‘He made a silly mistake but he referred to Pikey as that is the man’s nickname after the well-known character in Dad’s Army. It is not meant to refer to him being a gipsy.’ In November Mr Harman linked to a tweet about well-endowed black men. The link showed a picture of two men engaged in a sex act. Back in September, he also favourited a link to a Tweet on a similar theme. Mr Dromey said he had accidentally stumbled on the gay porn website - which featured a character called ‘Paris’.","Shadow police minister lands himself in hot water after latest web gaffe .

And she isn't alone. The girl in the polka dot headscarf and her family are just some of the thousands of people who have crossed the border into Iraq in a bid to escape the slaughter in Syria. Although the raging civil war has cost her family their home, the girl is luckier than most. An ethnic Kurd, she has managed to escape the fighting that has taken the lives of thousands of her compatriots as well as the bouts of ethnic violence that have taken the lives of Kurds in Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran over the last century. Now she and other Kurdish refugees are the subject of a series of stunning photographs by French snapper Eric Lafforgue who travelled to Iraq last month to meet them. Refugee: This girl, a Syrian Kurd, was forced to flee with her family to a refugee camp in the Iraqi Kurdish city of Erbil after her home was bombed . Pitiless: The raging conflict in Syria has spared no one, young or old, and as a result, vast numbers have been forced to make the perilous journey into Iraq . 'We know the Kurdish people well because they suffered a . lot under the Saddam Hussein regime,' he explains. 'They were killed with chemical weapons in Halabja.' Since the fall of the dictator, Iraq has become a safer place for Kurds thanks to the creation of a Kurdish statelet within the country where many of those fleeing violence in Syria have taken shelter. 'Nowadays, many Kurdish Syrian refugees have found shelter in Kurdistan,' adds Lafforgue. 'It was interesting to meet people who have led such a difficult life and who are trying to build a new nation. 'The girl in the polka dot scarf lives in a refugee camp in Erbil [in Iraqi Kurdistan] and had to leave her village [in Syria] two months ago after it was bombed. They have nothing, just the help of the other Kurds.' Haunted: . This young boy's face bears traces of his recent ordeal. His blond hair . and green eyes are thought to be the result of Russians who married . Kurdish women . Pretty: This little girl is now safe in Kurdistan but it wasn't always the case - Iraqi Kurds became victims of Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons in 1988 . Tough times: For this boy and his family, the onset of winter is something to be dreaded thanks to the precarious nature of life in the refugee camps . And life in the refugee camp is far from easy. 'Winter will come with the rains, and everybody fears the worst,' explains Lafforgue. 'Her beauty hides a cruel reality.' Despite their difficult circumstances, Lafforgue reveals that not only were the refugees happy to let him photograph them, they proved generous and welcoming hosts. 'They all welcomed me as a friend and offered me food and drink, even when they had nothing for them,' he remembers. Other portraits in the series include that of an older woman, in a vibrant cerulean headscarf, and a little blond boy whose face still bears traces of a recent ordeal. Most striking of all is the fact that nearly all have stunning blue eyes - unusual among Middle Eastern peoples for whom liquid dark brown is the norm. 'They are not Arab,' explains Lafforgue. 'They do not want you to call them Arabs.They are Kurdish and it is different. Their . story is a mix of migration and invasion. 'Many say that Russians came during the last century and felt in love with Kurdish women, which is where the blue eyes are thought to come from.' All . smiles: Despite their precarious existence, photographer Eric Lafforgue . says the Kurdish refugees were wonderfully kind and welcoming . Cruel reality: The story of the Kurdish people . is one of invasion and migration with the majority of Kurds now split . between Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria . The 30 million strong population of ethnic Kurds originated in Iran and now live mainly in Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria, although a significant diaspora is also to be found in Armenia, Georgia, Israel, Azerbaijan, Russia and Lebanon. An ancient people, the first mention of the Kurds came in 3000 BC, when a Sumerian tablet spoke of the land of 'Kar-da' and referred to the 'Kur' [mountain] people. There are also numerous legends associated with the origins of the Kurds, including one which claims they are the descendants of King Solomonâ€™s angelic servants or Djinn, who were sent to Europe to find 500 beautiful maidens for the king's harem. But by the time the Djinn returned, the king had died and the servants settled in the mountains, married the women themselves and founded the Kurdish people. By the early mediaeval period, the Kurdish clans ruled mini-kingdoms across the Middle East before coming under the rule of the Ottoman sultans of Istanbul. Although the Kurds had lived peacefully for much of the Ottoman period, the 19th century brought the birth of the Kurdish nationalist movement which first reared its head as a political entity in 1880 under Sheik Ubeydullah. The uprising was suppressed but nationalism was not forgotten. In the years after the World Wars and the end of the Ottoman Empire, repeated rebellions in Turkish Kurdistan led to the imposition of martial law while in Iraq, Kurdish nationalism was met with the tanks and bombs of the ruling Ba'ath party. By the 1970s, the PKK or Kurdish Worker's Party, had become entrenched in eastern Turkey, fighting running battles with Turkish armed forces and considered a terrorist organisation by the UN and many Western nations. But it was in 1980s Iraq where the Kurds would meet their deadliest enemy - the chemical weapons of Saddam Hussein which killed more than 5,000 people in a 1988 attack on the town of Hallabja. Today, the Kurds are still spread far and wide but the peace process in Turkey is beginning to improve the lot of those living between the Turkish army and the PKK. In Iraq meanwhile, the autonomous region of Kurdistan in the north has provided a haven for local Iraqi Kurds and those fleeing from the conflict in neighbouring Syria.","French photographer Eric Lafforgue travelled to refugee camps near the town of Erbil in northern Iraq .

Whether for shopping, banking or catching up with news, Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows that 7.1 million adults in the UK have never been online. Around 14 per cent of the adult population of the UK have not surfed the web, but the number has fallen by 10 per cent a year ago. A graphic from the ONS shows a comparison of age groups of people who have never used the internet. Just over 3 in every 10 adults aged 75+ have surfed the web . Of all the people who have missed out, approximately 45 per cent are over the age of 75, while perhaps unsurprisingly almost all 16 to 24-year-olds have connected to the internet. Men are more likely to be technologically enabled than women, with 88 per cent of men and 84 per cent of women ever going online. The ONS quarterly report on internet access states: 'Internet use is linked to various socio-economic and demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, disability, geographical location and weekly earnings. 'For example, those who are less likely to have used the internet include both the elderly and disabled adults.' Around 14 per cent of the adult population of the UK have not surfed the web, but the number has fallen possibly because more people are accessing the internet on a variety of devices including smartphones . Individuals with a disability are approximately four times more likely to have never used the internet than people without a disability. The study found around 3.6 million disabled adults have never used the internet, which represents about a third of disabled people in the UK and 54 per cent of UK adults who have not surfed the web. However, the figures show that since 2011, the . number of internet users has increased by 2.9 million and now stands at . 43.6 million adults. By . region, London and the South East have the highest proportion of . Internet users at 89 per cent, while Northern Ireland has the lowest at . 79 per cent.

A report by media regulator Ofcom in March, said UK adults spend more than 15 hours online each week â€“ up by five hours from six years ago. A combination of older generations going online, the continuing rise of social networking sites and the number of people who own smartphones are being credited for the rise. the study suggests growth is being driven by older age groups such as those aged between 45 and 54-years-old, but that the most elderly members of society were being left behind in the online revolution.

The family of a 23-year-old Santa Rosa man who died after he contracted the H1N1 flu virus says his illness wasn't accurately diagnosed until it was too late to possibly save his life. The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reports Matthew Walker was admitted to a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Santa Rosa on December 27 after he reported breathing difficulties. The previous day he was sent home from the hospital after being diagnosed with pneumonia. Desperately ill: This was the last picture Matthew Walker posted on Facebook, the day before he was put in an induced coma . Walker's family says Kaiser doctors didn't discover Walker had the 'swine flu' until after he was put into a medically induced coma before his death Wednesday. Walker is one of four people who have died in the most recent outbreak of the H1N1 strain on California's north coast. The virus first emerged in 2009. In the 2009-2010 flu season, 12,000 people died from the virus - or complications caused by the disease - across the U.S. The previously healthy 23-year-old's Facebook page provides a devastating timeline of his decline. Strong young man: Walker was an active young man who enjoyed skateboarding and worked two jobs . On December 22, he posted that he had a sore throat, cough, runny nose, nausea and a headache, plus no food at the Santa Rosa apartment he shared with two roommates. 'The things that make me miss home... Like moms home made chicken noodle soup!' he wrote. By December 26, Walker wrote that he'd spent a 'miserable' six hours in the emergency room of Kaiser Permanente hospital where he was diagnosed with 'bad' pneumonia on his left lung. The very last post Walker made was a picture of himself looking wan and tired with the caption, 'Lying on a gurney with 103 temp today. No fun...' Prevention: Doctors recommend the flu vaccine to ward off this season's deadly H1N1 strain . According to the Press Democrat, Walker's sister Ruth Bell said her brother's cough became so violent on December 27 that doctors had to sedate him. He went into cardiac arrest and was put in an induced coma. His brain began to swell. Walker's sister, Ruth Bell, said Saturday her brother's death is a 'devastating loss' and 'there is some anger.'

As many pointed out, the Alinea experience is pricey, a very special night out for most people. 'I'd be livid if I came to Next, Alinea, or ANY fine dining establishment and had to sit through a crying baby,' tweeted Richard LaRue. But the unique booking system for Alinea may have been the reason for the dinner date plus one. The restaurant sells tickets like a play or concert. If something goes wrong - for example, if the babysitter cancels - there's no refund. Before the day was out, the controversy had become much more interesting in a Chinese whispers style evolution of the original story. Crying shame: If the couple were indeed left in the lurch by a babysitter, their only option was to bring baby or lose their $500 . 'Quickly scanning Twitter. Did Achatz eat/serve baby?' tweeted Josh Steinfeld.'So .... A friend of a friend told me that a woman gave birth while dining at Alinea last night ... Achatz delivered the baby ... Wow! LOL' wrote brbinchicago. Not to be outdone, the baby in question also decided to share its side of the story. By the end of the day, the saga had spawned an AlineaBaby Twitter account. Eager to tell his or her side of the story, AlineaBaby recounted the evening, apparently while in a first class lounge at the airport waiting to board a plane to New York - for dinner at Per se. According to AlineaBaby, his or her father had left his or her mother when she went on a strict healthy diet while pregnant. The Alinea tickets were a gift from the baby to the mother and her new beau. The baby appreciated the 'three kinds of unpasteurized breast milk as well as the foie gras, but became bored after 13 courses.

Fresh agony: Convicted murderer Joshua Komisarjevsky's attorney said his client is contemplating asking for a new trial . A convicted killer who held the Petit family hostage before murdering the mother and two daughters may ask for a new trial, his attorney said on Tuesday. Joshua Komisarjevsky is on death row after Jennifer Hawke-Petit was raped and . strangled to death and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, were . tied to their beds and died when the house in Cheshire, Connecticut was set alight . on July 23, 2007. The girls' father Dr William Petit was the only survivor who managed to escape the flames after being beaten and tied up. Attorney Walter Bansley told courant.com this week that his client may seek a new trial because he was unaware of the existence of the 911 calls. Some of the calls, posted online by the Hartford Courant, revealed that Connecticut police decided against . sending a hostage negotiator to the Petit family home on that fateful morning and told a SWAT team to hold back. Mr Bansley told the newspaper: 'There is no doubt that if we were aware of those calls we would have tried to use them at trial and it would have made for a different defense.' The defense attorney said that he is discussing whether the information creates grounds for a new trial along with lawyers handling Komisarjevsky's death sentence appeal. Mr Bansley said that the failure to turn over evidence in a death-penalty trial - where the judge allows almost everything to be included - is a 'big legal issue'. Komisarjevsky and accomplice Stephen Hayes were sentenced to death in 2011 for the murders. On the sixth anniversary of the . horrific killings, the Hartford Courant published calls from law enforcement sources showing that officers with the Cheshire . Police Department doubted the danger underway at the household. Torn apart: William Petit, right, was the only member of the family to escape alive. Jennifer Hawke-Petit was strangled and their daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, were killed in the flames . They were also outside the home when the murders were carried out and before the home was burned to the ground, it has emerged. Facing death: Stephen Hayes was convicted of triple murder in 2011 and is set to be executed . Police were first alerted to trouble at the house when Hawke-Petit was taken to a Bank of America and forced to withdraw $15,000, where she told the teller she was being held hostage. When a police officer went to the bank 23 . minutes after the initial 911 call, he told a dispatcher in a recorded . phone call that he doubted the accuracy of Hawke-Petit's story. 'She came into the bank, she tried to get some money out,' Lt James Fasano told the dispatcher. 'One of the accounts was in her husband's name, and then she says, ""Well, my kids are at home tied up"". So we don't know if they really are or if she was just trying to get money out at this point.' He added that she had entered the bank alone and appeared calm, and that her captor had said nothing would happen to her as long as she handed over the money. The phone calls also include one in which a hostage negotiator Eric Granoth is told he was not . needed at the scene. 'I need to know whether you want me in or . not,' he said in a 15-second conversation with dispatcher Donald Miller. 'I am the hostage negotiator and I got paged.' Miller then asked Deputy Chief . Joseph Popovich if he wanted the negotiator, and Miller can be heard telling Granoth 'not at this time' before hanging up. Crime scene: The killers broke into this home in Cheshire and held the family hostage - but the police told a hostage negotiator not to report to the home. Authorities have not explained why . New Haven Public Defender Thomas Ullmann, who represented Hayes, said: 'The fact that a . hostage negotiator, listening to what was going on during the dispatch . communications, felt compelled to call central police headquarters . offering his assistance and then being turned away is shocking.' Miller then received a call from SWAT team member Kerry Nastri, who asks whether they should start suiting up and head to the scene - but Miller said officers said they would call on them if they were needed. Ten minutes later, Nastri called back to say they were going there anyway. Also shocking is how the police have never performed a review of the incident. Town Manager Michael Milone would not . provide a reason for this, nor one for why the hostage negotiator was . told not to go to the home. Looking forward: Five years after losing his family, Dr Petit married Christine Paluf last year . Cindy Renn, Jennifer Hawke-Petit's . sister, told the Courant that authorities have never carried out a . review of the incident or their actions. 'Nobody . in that department ever looked at what they did or didn't do right or . wrong,' Renn said. 'Admit when you make mistakes and do better the next . time and save people's lives.' An HBO documentary that aired on Monday included a timeline that placed police at the house before Hawke-Petit was raped or the house was set on fire.","Joshua Komisarjevsky sentenced to death in 2011 for brutal murders of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 .

Arabic TV network Al-Jazeera has said it will not air disturbing footage of the Toulouse shootings after the video was sent to its office in Paris. It appeared to have been recorded during Mohammed Merah's deadly attacks on soldiers and a Jewish school earlier this month. The station's decision not to broadcast the video, which was sent on a USB memory stick along with a letter, came after French president Nicolas Sarkozy and family of the victims had asked for it not to be shown. The video has been edited into a 'montage' accompanied by an Islamic war songs, and was sent in a package post-dated March 21 - the day before 23-year-old Merah was killed by French special forces in his home city. Investigators have already confirmed that Merah had a small video camera strapped to his chest when he murdered a Rabbi and his two children, as well as a teenage pupil, at a Jewish school in Toulouse a week ago. The week before, the self-confessed 'Jihad warrior' also filmed his murders of three French soldiers who had fought in Afghanistan. Both Al-Jazeera and Le Parisien newspaper confirmed that the video footage had been seen in Paris. An unnamed source in Le Parisien, Paris's daily newspaper, said: 'Investigators are trying to find out whether the letter was posted Tuesday night by Mohamed Merah himself or by an accomplice on Wednesday morning.' The existence of an accomplice would end theories that Merah was a 'lone wolf' assassin who acted out of his hatred for the 'enemies' of Islam, and especially Jews. On Sunday his brother, Abdelkader Merah, 29, appeared before an anti-terrorist judge in Parisand was formally charged with 'complicity in murder'. Bullet holes line the wall of the apartment of Mohamed Merah, the self-proclaimed Islamic extremist who killed seven people, after a 32-hour siege . Scene: A general view of the block of apartments in which Mohammed Merah was shot by police . Abdelkader was remanded in custody, and taken to a high-security prison in Paris, where he is likely to remain until his trial. Adbelkader has already told police . interrogators that he was 'very proud' of what Merah did, and admitted . to dinning with him just before the attack on the Ozar Hatorah school in . Toulouse. 'Signals from Abdelkader's mobile . phone were emitted close to the school at the time of the murders,' said . an investigating source. Among numerous questions Abedelkader . is facing is why traces of explosive were found in his car, and how much . he knew about the arsenal of weapons his brother was storing. Victims: Imad Ibn-Ziaten, 30, Abel Chennouf, 25, and Mohamed Legouade, 26 were killed by Merah last week . Tragic: The mother and father of French paratrooper Imad Ben Ziaten carry a portrait of their son as they wait for his body's arrival at Rabat airport . It is also believed that Abdekkader . also helped his brother buy the Yamaha T-Max motorbike used in all the . attacks, and to respray the vehicle and to try and remove its tracking . device. Paris security sources believe that . both Merah brothers were involved in two local Islamist organisations, . Forsane Alizza (The Knights of Pride) and a more militant jihadist . network known as the Toulouse group, or Jund al-Khalifah. Jund al-Khalifah, an Al-Qaeda splinter . group, has already admitted to working with a 'Youssef the Frenchman' - . who is believed to be Merah. The French authorities are facing . growing criticism that Merah, a known fundamentalist who was on the U.S. no-fly list and had attended an al-Qaeda training camp, was left alone . to carry out his crimes.","Memory stick with video montage was sent to Arabic TV office the day before Mohammed Merah was shot dead .

Three feminist activists have been arrested for holding a topless demonstration outside a court today in protest against the jailing of a Tunisian member of Ukrainian feminist group FEMEN. FEMEN activist Amina Tyler, 19, was arrested at another protest against Islam's treatment of women earlier this month after she sparked outrage across Tunisia by posting topless pictures of herself online. A Muslim preacher called for the student to be stoned after the pictures, showing Tyler with the words: 'My body belongs to me' written across her bare chest in Arabic, were uploaded to Facebook. Scroll down for video . Supporters: Tunisian security arrest one of three Femen activists who were holding a topless protest in front of the Ministry of Justice, in Tunisia, against the arrest of fellow activist Amina Tyler . The naked truth: Amina Tyler, 19, caused outrage . in her native Tunisia last week when she posted topless photos of . herself on her Facebook page in a protest over women's rights . Baring all: Activists from the international feminist group Femen hold banners during a protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in Tunisia . She was later taken into hiding by her family after . conservative preachers issued death threats against her. The 19-year-old . said last month she wanted to do one last topless protest before she . left the country to study journalism in France and was arrested May 19 . in the religious center of Kairouan where an ultraconservative Muslim . group had hoped to hold a conference before it was banned by police. Tyler was charged with carrying a . dangerous object, apparently a canister of pepper spray, and will appear . before a judge tomorrow . Her supporters, three foreign activists, today disrobed in front of the Justice Ministry to protest against the court case. The trio, one German and two French, . approached the entrance to the ministry wearing coats which they took . off, revealing naked torsos scrawled with 'Breasts Feed Revolution'. Extreme . views: Salafist preacher Adel Almi (pictured) called for Amina to be . 'quarantined' and stoned to death after comparing her to someone with a . contagious illness . Wearing just jean shorts, the women chanted in English 'Free Amina' and 'Women's spring is coming' as people in the crowd attempted to cover them. The women then climbed up on the gates of the Justice Ministry until police pulled them down and hustled them shouting into the building as an angry crowd, many of them lawyers there for work, gathered. 'This is against our religion,' said Fatima Zahaouadi, a young woman wearing the black robes of a lawyer but without a conservative headscarf. 'For these women to take off their clothes as part of freedom of expression is against our religion and the traditions of Arab-Muslim Tunisian society.' The crowd surrounded the area where the women were being held and when the activists were transferred to a nearby building the crowed surged forward before being fended off by police. 'The Ministry of Justice is not a house of ill repute,' said Fawzia Dridi, an angry bystander. The crowd also attacked journalists attempting to cover the event as well as lawyers who tried to protect the reporters. Police took several journalists into custody to take statements from them as witnesses before releasing them. Tunisia's prosecutor's office later announced the women had been taken to main police station for questioning before being charged, and their embassies have been informed. The French consul visited the women and said they were in good spirits. Lawyers said they could be charged with an attack on public morals or threatening public order, offenses which could carry up to a year in prison. A member of FEMEN who identified herself as Inna told The Associated Press that the activists were protesting the treatment of women in the Arab world. In custody: The three women, two French and the other German, shouted: 'Free Amina,' outside the court before they were arrested . Clash: Members of the public in the Muslim country attacked the Femen activists for exposing their breasts until the women were escorted away by police officers . Agenda: Speaking ahead of the demonstration, one of the FEMEN activists called Inna said they were protesting against the treatment of women in Arab countries . 'We are attacking the Ministry of Justice one day before the trial for Tunisian FEMEN prisoner Amina to demand to let Amina free and to give up Islamists tradition judging women's liberation,' she wrote. 'FEMEN is planning first topless action in Arab country as a sign of a big changes ... Femen is announcing the women's spring that (is) starting in Tunisia.' Though it has the reputation as one of the most progressive countries in the Middle East for women's rights, overwhelmingly Muslim Tunisia is still a relatively conservative society and there has been a rise of piety since the overthrow of the secular dictatorship in 2011. FEMEN, which has carried out semi-nude protests in Europe, has only recently started focusing on the Middle East, especially after Tyler's actions. Middle East feminists, however, have largely condemned their approach saying their tactics are foreign to the largely conservative region and risk provoking backlash against women and real concerns like achieving equality. The protests come during a particularly delicate period for Tunisia, where decades of progressive legislation are being challenged by a rising trend of conservatism and there is a struggle over the identity of this North African nation of 10 million. Facing prison: The Femen activists face charges of threatening public order and attacking public morals which could carry up to a year in prison .

Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mohamed El Baradei was allegedly named interim Prime Minister of Egypt last night . Mohamed El Baradei, a former UN nuclear agency chief, is due to be named as Egypt’s interim prime minister, it was claimed last night. The 71-year-old Nobel Peace laureate is said to have been summoned to the presidential palace yesterday afternoon to be sworn in by interim president Adli Mansour. The pro-reform leader has long been the favourite to head a new administration. He led the opposition to Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled by an uprising in 2011, and later to Islamist president Mohammed Morsi, who was forced out by the military last week. Last night, the appointment was criticised by the Freedom and Justice Party, the Muslim Brotherhood’s political wing. A spokesman said: ‘We reject this coup and all that results from it, including ElBaradei.’ The announcement came as the country braces itself for another day of violence today following a weekend of fighting which has left 35 dead and more than 1,100 injured. Opponents of Morsi are expected to clash with his supporters when the Muslim Brotherhood stages a demonstration in Cairo’s Tahrir Square at 4pm. It follows fierce fighting on Friday, when Islamists took to the streets to denounce Morsi’s overthrow. The deadliest clashes were in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, where 14 people were killed and 200 were wounded. In central Cairo, pro- and anti-Morsi protesters fought pitched battles late into the night with stones, knives, petrol bombs and clubs. A Coptic Christian priest was also shot dead yesterday in the coastal city of El Arish  in what is believed to be the first sectarian attack since Morsi’s overthrow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired a top Russian Olympic official after publicly ridiculing him on a visit to the winter Olympics site. In an attempt to stamp his authority on the event he sacked Akhmed Bilalov, 42, vice-president of Russia's Olympic committee, after becoming annoyed that the ski-jump was not on schedule. The current price tag for the Sochi Games is 1.5 trillion rubles ($51 billion), which would make them the most expensive games in the history of the Olympics - more costly even than the much-larger Summer Olympics held in London and Beijing. Sacked: Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired a top Russian Olympic official after publicly ridiculing him when he found out the ski-jump was not on schedule . Fired:  Mr Putin sacked Akhmed Bilalov, 42, vice-president of Russia's Olympic committee, pictured last month, after becoming annoyed that the ski-jump was not on schedule . Pressure: Next year Games are even more costly than even than the much-larger Summer Olympics held in London and Beijing . The games at the Black Sea resort of Sochi are considered a matter of national pride and one of Putin's top priorities. Putin's decision came after he . scolded officials over a two-year delay and huge cost overruns in the . construction of the Sochi ski jump facilities. The Russian official involved, Akmet . Bilalov, had a company that was building the ski jump and its adjacent . facilities before selling its stake to state-owned Sberbank last year. During his tour of Olympic venues, . Putin fumed when he heard that the cost of the ski jump had soared from . 1.2 billion rubles ($40 million) to 8 billion rubles ($265 million) and . the project was behind schedule. Unamused: Russia's President Vladimir Putin, centre, walks with deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak (third left) during a tour of Olympic venues yesterday . Update: Mr Putin visits the Olympic village. The 2014 Winter Games, which open one year from today, are expected to cost $51 billion, making it the most expensive Olympics in history . Bitter: Putin's decision came after he scolded officials over a two-year delay and huge cost overruns in the construction of the Sochi ski jump facilities . So a vice president of the Olympic Committee is dragging down the entire construction? Well done! You are doing a good job,' Putin said Wednesday, seething with sarcasm. Deputy . Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak told reporters Thursday that Putin had . recommended that the Russian Olympic Committee fire Bilalov, one of its . six vice presidents. 'As far as Bilalov is concerned the . president voiced his decision yesterday: People who don't make good on . their obligations at such a scale cannot head the Olympic movement in . our country,' he said. Most countries that host the Olympics . use public funds to pay for most of the construction of the sports . venues and new infrastructure like roads and trains. The Russian . government, however, has got state-controlled companies and tycoons . to foot more than half of the bill. Assurances: Despite these setbacks, Russian officials today went to great lengths to reiterate that everything in Sochi was now on schedule . Priority: The games at the Black Sea resort of Sochi are considered a matter of national pride and one of Putin's top priorities . Both the companies and the tycoons . understand the importance of maintaining good relations with Putin, who . has a lot of prestige riding on the success of the Sochi games. Kozak said the costs constantly . increased for the ski jump project because Bilalov's company did not . properly check the land and, as a result, picked a geologically . challenging plot. 'His calculations failed,' Kozak said. The Russian Olympic Committee was . quoted by Russian news agencies as saying that Bilalov's future can only . be decided by a session of its executive committee. Despite these setbacks, Russian . officials went to great lengths to reiterate that everything in . Sochi was now on schedule. 'As IOC members and we stated . yesterday, it is already clear that we have succeeded with this immense . and possibly the most immense project in Russia's modern history,' Kozak . said. Tour: Mr Putin talks to journalists as he visits the Speed Skating centre 'Adler Arena' Guided tour: Vladimir Putin rides in a bus with the head of the Sochi 2014 organising committee Dmitry Chernyshenko . Taking a cue from Putin, however, Russian officials sought to . play down the high costs. Kozak said the government spent no more than . 100 billion rubles ($3 billion) on the Olympic venues and the immediate . infrastructure. The government has spent a total of . $13 billion so far, and expects to spend about $18 billion overall . before the games begin, Kozak has said previously. On Thursday, Kozak said it was unfair . to compare Sochi's budget to that of previous Olympic games because . Russian organizers had to build most of the vital and costly . infrastructure that was needed - roads, railways, tunnels, gas pipelines . - from scratch. No Russian officials went near the . topic of possible corruption, even though Russian business is . notoriously plagued by it. Russia last year ranked 133rd out of 176 in . Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index, along with . countries such as Kazakhstan, Iran and Honduras. Vow: Putin vowed today Russia would justify expectations when it hosts the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi in one year, after ruthlessly firing an official blamed for delays in building infrastructure . Race is on: Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and IOC President Jaques Rogge  press a symbolic button to mark One Year to the start . Although there were no documented . cases of corruption directly linked to Olympic construction in Sochi, a . dozen officials from the Sochi government have been slapped with charges . of corruption in the past year. Kozak and Sochi officials insist that . they're keeping the situation under control and that no money is being . stolen at Olympic sites. Sochi organizers also sought to . assuage fears that the 2014 Games may fall victim to a warm and snowless . winter - or a howling blizzard. Temperatures at Sochi's Krasnaya . Polyana ski resort hovered at 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) on Thursday, and reached 66 degrees F (19 C) in the coastal city of . Sochi.

The New York Police Department has secretly labeled entire mosques as terrorism organisations, a designation that allows police to use informants to record sermons and spy on imams, often without specific evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Since the 9/11 attacks, the NYPD has opened at least a dozen 'terrorism enterprise investigations' into mosques, according to interviews and confidential police documents. The TEI, as it is known, is a police tool intended to help investigate terrorist cells and the like. Scroll down for video . Spied on: Dr Muhamad Albar (far left) speaks during Jumu'ah prayer service at the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge mosque, which was targeted by the New York Police Department under controversial anti-terror laws . Members of the Bay Ridge mosque in prayer: Designating an entire mosque as a terrorism enterprise means that anyone who attends services is a potential subject of an investigation and fair game for surveillance . Designating an entire mosque as a . terrorism enterprise means that anyone who attends prayer services there . is a potential subject of an investigation and fair game for . surveillance. Many TEIs . stretch for years, allowing surveillance to continue even though the . NYPD has never criminally charged a mosque or Islamic organisation with . operating as a terrorism enterprise. The . documents show in detail how, in its hunt for terrorists, the NYPD . investigated countless innocent New York Muslims and put information . about them in secret police files. As . a tactic, opening an enterprise investigation on a mosque is so . potentially invasive that while the NYPD conducted at least a dozen, the . FBI never did one, according to interviews with federal law enforcement . officials. The strategy has allowed the NYPD to send . undercover officers into mosques and attempt to plant informants on the . boards of mosques and at least one prominent Arab-American group in . Brooklyn, whose executive director has worked with city officials, . including Bill de Blasio, a front-runner for mayor. Linda Sarsour, the executive director, . said her group helps new immigrants adjust to life in the U.S. It was . not clear whether the police were successful in their plans. Under suspicion: Since the 9/11 attacks, the NYPD has opened at least a dozen 'terrorism enterprise investigations' into mosques, including the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge in Brooklyn . 'I have never felt free in the United States. The documents tell me I am right': Zein Rimawi, founder of the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge pictured (left) reviewing the NYPD files which reveal his mosque had been under surveillance and (right) on a protest March in New York in support of ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi . Sarsour, a Muslim who has met with Kelly many times, said she felt betrayed. 'It creates mistrust in our organisations,' said Sarsour, who was born and raised in Brooklyn. 'It makes one wonder and question who is sitting on the boards of the institutions where we work and pray.' The revelations about the NYPD's massive spying operations are in documents recently obtained by The Associated Press and part of a new book, Enemies Within: Inside the NYPD's Secret Spying Unit and bin Laden's Final Plot Against America. The book by AP reporters Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman is based on hundreds of previously unpublished police files and interviews with current and former NYPD, CIA and FBI officials. Among the mosques targeted as early as 2003 was the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge. 'I have never felt free in the United . States. The documents tell me I am right,' Zein Rimawi, one of the Bay . Ridge mosque's leaders, said after reviewing an NYPD document describing . his mosque as a terrorist enterprise. On the Defence: New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (left) and NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly (right) have previously denied accusations that the force engaged in racial profiling while combating crime . Rimawi, 59, came to the U.S. decades ago from Israel's West Bank.'Ray Kelly, shame on him,' he said. 'I am American.' The NYPD believed the tactics were necessary to keep the city safe, a view that sometimes put it at odds with the FBI. In August 2003, Cohen asked the FBI to install eavesdropping equipment inside a mosque called Masjid al-Farooq, including its prayer room. Al-Farooq had a long history of radical ties. Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian sheik who was convicted of plotting to blow up New York City landmarks, once preached briefly at Al-Farooq. Invited preachers raged against Israel, the United States and the Bush administration's war on terror. One of Cohen's informants said an imam from another mosque had delivered $30,000 to an al-Farooq leader, and the NYPD suspected the money was for terrorism. Former CIA chief Michael Hayden (above) said a terror attack similar to the Boston Marathon bombing could not have been executed in New York because of the NYPD's extensive spying on Muslims . But Amy Jo Lyons, the FBI assistant special agent in charge for counterterrorism, refused to bug the mosque. She said the federal law wouldn't permit it. The NYPD made other arrangements. Cohen's informants began to carry recording devices into mosques under investigation. They hid microphones in wristwatches and the electronic key fobs used to unlock car doors. Even under a TEI, a prosecutor and a judge would have to approve bugging a mosque. But the informant taping was legal because New York law allows any party to record a conversation, even without consent from the others. Like the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge, the NYPD never demonstrated in court that al-Farooq was a terrorist enterprise but that didn't stop the police from spying on the mosques for years. The disclosures come as the NYPD is fighting off lawsuits accusing it of engaging in racial profiling while combating crime. Earlier this month, a judge ruled that the department's use of the stop-and-frisk tactic was unconstitutional. The American Civil Liberties Union and two other groups have sued, saying the Muslim spying programs are unconstitutional and make Muslims afraid to practice their faith without police scrutiny. Both Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly have denied those accusations. They say police do not unfairly target people; they only follow leads. 'As a matter of department policy, undercover officers and confidential informants do not enter a mosque unless they are following up on a lead,' Kelly wrote recently in The Wall Street Journal. 'We have a responsibility to protect New Yorkers from violent crime or another terrorist attack - and we uphold the law in doing so.' An NYPD spokesman declined to comment. In May, former CIA chief Michael Hayden said a terror attack similar to the Boston Marathon bombing could not have been executed in New York City because of the NYPD's extensive spying on Muslim communities. Before the NYPD could target mosques as terrorist groups, it had to persuade a federal judge to rewrite rules governing how police can monitor speech protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The rules stemmed from a 1971 lawsuit, dubbed the Handschu case after lead plaintiff Barbara Handschu, over how the NYPD spied on protesters and liberals during the Vietnam War era. David Cohen, a former CIA executive who became NYPD's deputy commissioner for intelligence in 2002, said the old rules didn't apply to fighting against terrorism. Cohen told the judge that mosques could be used 'to shield the work of terrorists from law enforcement scrutiny by taking advantage of restrictions on the investigation of First Amendment activity.' NYPD lawyers proposed a new tactic, the TEI, that allowed officers to monitor political or religious speech whenever the 'facts or circumstances reasonably indicate' that groups of two or more people were involved in plotting terrorism or other violent crime. The judge rewrote the Handschu rules in 2003. In the first eight months under the new rules, the NYPD's Intelligence Division opened at least 15 secret terrorism enterprise investigations, documents show. At least 10 targeted mosques. And under the new Handschu guidelines, no one outside the NYPD could question the secret practice. Martin Stolar, one of the lawyers in the Handschu case, said it's clear the NYPD used enterprise investigations to justify open-ended surveillance. The NYPD should only tape conversations about building bombs or plotting attacks, he said. 'Every Muslim is a potential terrorist? It is completely unacceptable,' he said. 'It really tarnishes all of us and tarnishes our system of values.'","NYPD has opened at least 12 'terrorism enterprise investigations' since 9/11 .

More than a dozen properties on one of London's most expensive streets are currently standing empty after being abandoned by their super-wealthy owners, it has emerged. The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, north London - dubbed 'Billionaires' Row' - has at least 16 giant mansions standing vacant, with a combined value of an estimated £350million. Some of the homes have been unoccupied for up to 25 years, with the interiors left to rot and rooms taken over by plants, according to a new investigation. Vacancies: Around a third of the houses on 'Billionaires' Row in Hampstead are standing empty . Empty: Heath Hall, currently on the market for £65million, is one of at least 16 mansions on The Bishops Avenue which are currently unoccupied . Expensive: Jersey House is on sale for £40million, rendering it unaffordable for all but the super-rich . The Guardian reported that around a third of the properties on the most expensive stretch of the road are currently standing empty. And even some of the houses which have not been abandoned are unoccupied much of the time, according to residents, as they have been bought by rich foreigners who usually live abroad. The Bishops Avenue, which runs between Hampstead Heath and East Finchley, attracts wealthy buyers thanks to its large houses and extensive gardens, giving it a rural atmosphere despite its relatively central location. Among the empty houses on the road - home to media baron Richard Desmond as well as members of the Saudi and Brunei royal families - is Heath Hall, currently on sale for £65million. The 14-bedroom house, which was built for the founder of the Tate & Lyle sugar empire, cost its latest owner £40million to renovate after it fell into disrepair after years of neglect. For sale: £34million Stratheden is another home on 'Billionaires' Row' which is not being lived in . Confiscated: Dryades went on sale for £30million after being repossessed from its owner, a Pakistani minister . Other properties which are now on the market include Dryades, valued at £30million, which was repossessed from a former Pakistani government minister. The sky-high prices are one clue to why so many of the houses are empty, as the homes are unaffordable for nearly all Londoners, meaning they end up being bought by overseas royals and oligarchs who maintain their main residence elsewhere. The most extreme example of neglect comes in a group of 10 houses which been empty since the early 1990s before they were bought by a property company for £73million last year. The properties were bought by members of the Saudi royal family between 1989 and 1993, according to the Guardian. They could have been intended as boltholes to escape the turbulence in the Middle East being stirred up by Saddam Hussein at the time, which may explain why after his defeat in the Gulf War and subsequent deposition the houses were apparently unused. The 10 homes are now so run-down that they are strewn with rubble after the ceilings fell in, while bird skeletons are scattered around the floors. Location, location, location: The road runs between Hampstead Heath and East Finchley in north London . Bargain: Seven-bedroom Caravilla was one of the cheaper homes on the street when it sold for £12.5million . Anil Varma, a property developer who is helping to renovate the houses, described the road as 'one of the most expensive wastelands in the world'. He told the Guardian: 'Not many true local residents live on the road. It is the likes of the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Brunei. They buy a property and don't do anything with it.' One local resident said that he thought just three houses on the street's most expensive section were occupied full-time, while another said: '95 per cent of the people who live here don't actually live here. 'It is a terrible place to live really. It is very boring and the road is very busy.' The revelation that so much prime property is essentially unused could help fuel the debate over the squeeze on first-time buyers. The average house price in Britain is now £176,491, more than six and a half times the median salary, while in London prices rose by more than 11 per cent last year. Boris Johnson has backed calls to levy punitive rates of council tax on homes which are unoccupied for two years or more, and campaigners are pushing for the Government to confiscate unused land if developers refuse to build on it.","The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead is one of Britain's most expensive streets .

'While . we are distracted with answering these calls we are not attending to . other more important calls from the public which potentially could put . lives at risk and reduce the service we provide and our response to . incidents.' Other examples include a frustrated television viewer who called because she could not find the movie she wanted to watch. 'Ridiculous': In one time-wasting phone call, a woman dialled 999 because she couldn't find the film see wanted to watch on Sky TV (stock image) The Sky subscriber dialled the emergency services number to lodge a complaint when she could not find a particular film on the channel's movie box service. Another woman dialled 999 because her daughter's hamster got . stuck under the floorboards. And another mother called because her son’s . radio-controlled helicopter had crashed on a nearby shop roof and they . needed help to retrieve it. Police say these calls waste operators' time and prevent them from dealing with real emergencies. Superintendent Moran added: 'If it is clearly not a police matter do not use us a directory inquiry or advice service. We will and regularly do prosecute callers who repeatedly abuse the 999 system. 'The simple message is you should only call 999 in an emergency when a crime is in progress, a suspect is nearby or life is in danger. For all other matters use the non-emergency number 101.' Other time-wasting calls the force has received include a neighbour complaining a couple next door were making love loudly with the windows open while a shopper dialled 999 because because a store would not exchange a pair of shoes she had bought. Another parent even called 999 to ask if police officers could attend her home because her son would not eat his breakfast. Operators also regularly received drunken phone calls from revellers asking for a taxi home.","Woman with maggots in bin afraid 'neighbours will turn against her'

The rise of Eurosceptic parties is a 'worrying development' for the European Union which has helped keep peace for the past 50 years, the German foreign minister has warned. Warning against the type of 'nationalism' which caused the First World War, Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the European Union had convinced countries to 'get together, politically' after years of conflict. Speaking on his first visit to London since being appointed in December, he warned, when asked about Tory Eurosceptics calling for Britain to exit the EU, that this route could have 'dangers'. Warning: German foreignÂ minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier takes part in the German cabinet meeting in Berlin . But the minister gave a glimmer of hope to David Cameron by saying Germany is not against the principle of changing EU treaties to return some powers to national parliaments. Mr Steinmeier warned politicians not to 'backtrack' on what had been achieved through European integration and said the run-up to the 1914-18 war showed the importance of close ties. He said: 'You have got Eurosceptics getting together in parties, getting more public attention, and while Europe is in a crisis it doesn't make our work any easier. 'As a politician you have got a clear choice, either you hide or you really keep going along the same lines of the positive experience we have had over the last 50 years. 'The European Union is one of the reasons for peace, even though our interests may have been different, even in spite of our different histories before agreeing on European cooperation. 'Despite the wounds we have inflicted on each other, we have managed to get together - politically - in this part of the world. We have convinced people, we have learned to deal with different opinions and that is civilising progress which cannot be questioned or challenged.' Mr Steinmeier warned politicians not to 'backtrack' on what had been achieved through European integration . He added: 'The history before the First world war was of not talking to each other, of alienation, of nationalisms...These experiences have led to a conviction that these dangers have to be forever banned from Europe, and it should be the basis of our common work in a common Europe.' Mr Cameron has promised an in-out referendum on Britain's membership in 2017 if he wins the next election, after he has tried to negotiate a better deal. However he is under pressure from the UK Independence Party, which wants Britain to leave the EU immediately and restrict immigration. It is expected to top the poll in the European elections in May, pushing the Tories into third place. Far Right parties across Europe, such as Front National in France and Jobbik in Hungary - which is accused of fuelling racial hatred - are also expected to get record numbers of MEPs in May. Mr Steinmeier said Germany wanted the UK to remain 'a strong an important player in the European Union' - and to influence policy 'not from the sidelines but in the midst of it'. At a press conference with foreign secretary William Hague, Mr Steinmeier said Germany's relationship with Britain was 'almost perfect, there are hardly any complications'. He  admitted that the EU needs reform to be 'more functional and more efficient' but not restrictions on free movement of people, which he said Germany considered to be 'part of the solution'. His remarks come after a bruising week for the prime minister, which saw him face down a major rebellion by 86 of his backbenchers over immigration on Thursday. Mr Cameron appeared unable to control his party as dozens of MPs backed an attempt to stop foreign prisoners using the right to a family life in the Human Rights Act to stay in Britain. They had been warned it was illegal by the home secretary, but the rebels were only defeated with help from the Labour leader Ed Miliband who ordered MPs to oppose the plans.","Frank-Walter Steinmeier warns against 'nationalism'

Amber Langford and Annie Collinge, both 19, won the contest and a £150 prize at a Chester nightclub despite lampooning the worst terrorist attack in modern history. Today, families of those who lost loved ones in the New York terror attack said that they found the costumes distressing. Patricia Bingley, 79, whose 43-year-old . son Kevin Dennis died in the atrocity said: 'It's hard to understand . where they've come from to do this.'

Tasteless: Annie Collinge took this picture of herself as she was getting ready for the party . They had modelled their costumes on the North and South Tower wreathed in flames and with victims jumping from windows. Both women also wore hats topped with the wreckage of the planes and U.S. flags. The widow of a 9/11 victim living near Chester said she was 'angry and disgusted' at the girls' outfit and suggested that they were ignorant about the true horror of the terror attack. Liz Gilligan, whose husband Ron was working in the World Trade Center at the time of the atrocity, told the Chester Chronicle: 'I can't begin to tell you how angry and disgusted I am. 'These girls and Rosie’s need to be made aware that 9/11 was very real and while it was 3,000 miles away, it affected people on their doorstep.' Some clubbers were so disgusted that they tried to complain to management. 'I . was completely outraged,' said 20-year-old George Borsberry. 'Not only . were they labelled the ""best dressed"", but they were also given £150 to . dress up in this way and mock the victims and the families of the . victims.

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 10:58 EST, 2 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:00 EST, 2 January 2014 . A teenager with severe curvature of the spine has improved dramatically despite being told she might never stand up straight again. Heidi Griffins, 15, was diagnosed with scoliosis three years ago after her P.E. teacher noticed her shoulder was sticking out on one side. The keen tennis player was diagnosed with a severe curvature of the spine and surgery was recommended as the only option to help her recover. Heidi Griffins was diagnosed with severe curvature of the spine - or scoliosis - three years ago and was told she would need major spinal surgery to place metal rods in her back . Had she opted for surgery she would have had metal rods inserted into her back, before having her spine fused. But frustrated with the lack of options and terrified of what the future could hold for her daughter, Heidi’s mother, Clare, investigated alternative treatments, before eventually discovering the Scoliosis SOS clinic in London. Set up more than seven years ago by Erika Maude, a former scoliosis patient, the clinic has helped hundreds of sufferers through the problem by teaching them exercises which improve their posture. The exercises vary depending on the severity of the condition. Within a week of starting an intensive four-week treatment course, Heidi started to notice a difference, with less pain across her back and an improvement in her breathing capacity. Heidi, from Durham, said: ‘When I was told that I had scoliosis, I didn’t really understand to start with. ‘No one ever sat me down and explained what was going on in my back until I got to the SOS clinic. Instead of the operation, Heidi opted to take part in a four week exercise programme in London and she is now pain free and able to return to playing tennis . ‘The staff at the SOS clinic were amazing, they made me feel normal again. ‘They also encouraged me to carry on living a normal life when all of the specialists at the hospital were telling me that I needed to be careful and not put too much pressure on my body by doing too much sport. ‘The exercises weren’t hard - you just had to think about what you were doing. ‘I am the sort of person to put 100 per cent into everything I do and I believe that’s why I got such good results. I cannot wait to get back to playing tennis.’ Heidi, together with her family are now working to raise awareness of scoliosis and the alternatives to surgery. Scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an S-shape. Signs include a visible curve in the spine, one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other, clothes not hanging properly and back pain. Pain usually only affects adults with the condition. In most cases, the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy. In the UK, scoliosis affects three to four children out of every 1,000. It is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis. It is more common in women than in men. Most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows. However, in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing. Occasionally, a child needs surgery to straighten their spine. In adults, it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain.

"By . James  Nye . PUBLISHED: . 02:43 EST, 31 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:55 EST, 31 December 2013 . Despite near-global adulation signaled by his recognition as Time person of the year for 2013, not everyone is in raptures over Pope Francis' attempts to rebrand the Catholic Church. Home Depot founder Kenneth Langone, who is estimated to be worth $2.1 billion, has baulked at what he sees as hyper-critical comments aimed at the rich by the pontiff in his first published exhortation Evangelii Gaudium - fearing that he does not comprehend rich Americans. Langone, 78, who is a devout Catholic has called the statements attributed to the pope on capitalism as 'exclusionary' and pointedly said that one wealthy anonymous benefactor he knows is reconsidering the seven-figure donation he wants to make to the restoration of Manhattan's St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. Unimpressed: Ken Langone, Director and co-founder of Home Depot, Yumi Brands, Choicepoint and former director of The New York Stock Exchange has expressed his dissatisfaction with some of Pope Francis' comments on the wealthy . In an interview with CNBC, Langone said that the donor, who he would not name, was becoming concerned at the message the Argentinian pope was espousing - in which he urges the rich to give more to the poor and attacks a 'culture of prosperity' that causes some to become 'incapable of feeling compassion for the poor'. Langone told the network that he has personally raised his worries with Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York. 'I've told the cardinal, 'Your Eminence, this is one more hurdle I hope we don't have to deal with,' said Langone. 'You want to be careful about generalities. Rich people in one country don't act the same as rich people in another country.' Worried that the Pope does not understand wealthy American's, Langone, who prays every morning, said that he has told Cardinal Dolan that 'you got more with honey than vinegar' and that he wants the archbishop to make it clear to the pope that wealthy Americans are the largest givers to charity in the world. 'There is no nation on earth that is so forthcoming, so giving,' he said to CNBC, adding that he hopes the pope can 'celebrate a positive point of view rather than focusing on the negative.' He does worry, though he said, because of 'the vast difference between the Popeâ€™s experience in Argentina and how we are in America. There is no nation on earth that is so forthcoming, so giving.' Under threat: Kenneth Langone told Cardinal Timothy Dolan - the archbishop of New York that an anonymous donor was considering withholding a seven-figure donation towards New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral because of the pope's comments . In his first exhortation which was published in November, Pope Francis pointed his finger at 'an economy of exclusion and inequality' and blamed capitalist ideologies that 'defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation.' However, for his part, Dolan told CNBC that he had spoken to Langone and tried to allay his fears and that of the potential, but anonymous donor who wants to contribute to the estimated $180 million renovation costs. 'Well, Ken, that would be a misunderstanding of the Holy Father's message,' said Cardinal Dolan. 'The pope loves poor people. He also loves rich people.' ... So I said, 'Ken, thanks for bringing it to my attention. We've gotta correct to make sure this gentleman understands the Holy Father's message properly.' And then I think he's gonna say, 'Oh, OK. If that's the case, count me in for St. Patrick's Cathedral.' Dolan told CNBC that he did not know the would-be donor's name and Langone said that he would not name him - only that he was upset about the pope's comments about the rich. Pope Francis delivers his Christmas Day message from the central balcony of St Peter's Basilica on December 25, 2013 in Vatican City, Vatican. The 'Urbi et Orbi' blessing (to the city and to the world) is recognised as a Christmas tradition by Catholics . Indeed, according to the Charities Aid Foundation, the United States ranks No.1 as in the World Giving Index and proportionally, more Americans give to charity than any country on Earth. Dolan said that the pope is aware of the 'legendary generosity of the Catholic Church in the United States.' Speaking to CNBC, Arthur Brooks, head of the American Enterprise Institute said that he agrees with Langone that the pope is speaking from his life in Argentina - a country known for economic uncertainty and corruption. 'In places like Argentina, what they call free enterprise is a combination of socialism and crony capitalism,' he said. Going further, Brooks said that while the pope's exhortation read in its original Spanish was 'good and right and beautiful', it suffers from a 'limited understanding of economics from the American context.' Critical: Senator John McCain and radio host Rush Limbaugh have been critical of the pope's message and Limbaugh dubbed it 'Marxist' He also said that Pope Francis 'is not an economist and not an American.' 'For American Catholics and Americans in general, we have a moral responsibility to the poor to spread the word of true free enterprise around the world,' Brooks said. 'By doing that, we have the best shot of meeting the Holy Father's objectives, which are good objectives.' During his rise to almost rock-star status the pope has suffered a backlash from some on the American right. Republican Sen. John McCain and  conservative radio commentator Rush Limbaugh, have weighed in on Francis' statements, with the latter calling it 'pure Marxism.'","Billionaire Home Depot founder Kenneth Langone has announced he is uncomfortable with Pope Francis' recent comments on wealth .

Woken by an explosion that shook her home, Margaret Goodwin knew she was in a pickle the moment she saw the wreckage in her kitchen. The fridge door had been blown off and the shock wave had lifted the ceiling, cracked walls, sent shards of glass flying and blasted the casing off an extractor fan. Fearing that perhaps a gas main had exploded, she called the fire brigade, who revealed that her flat had actually been blown up by...rhubarb chutney. Bombsite: The force of the exploding rhubarb chutney jar was powerful enough to rip the door off Margaret Goodwin's fridge . Shaken: Mrs Goodwin with her new fridge after a jar of chutney destroyed her previous one . Mrs Goodwin, 66, had been given the home-made preserve by a neighbour and had left it in the fridge in an uncovered ceramic ramekin. After five days, the chutney, which was made without the chemical preservatives used in mass-produced varieties, began to ferment and give off methane – a gas that can be explosive when mixed with air. And so it proved for Mrs Goodwin, whose fridge had been shut for 12 hours, meaning there was nowhere for the gas to go until she heard a ‘massive bang’ while in bed at 7am. ‘It was a terrible shock,’ the divorcee said. ‘My bed jolted and there was a tremendous noise. ‘I knew it was from my flat and approached the kitchen with trepidation. It was a total mess inside. Wreckage: Margaret Goodwin was confronted with a scene of destruction after investigating a huge explosion in her kitchen early on Tuesday morning . ‘I always keep the kitchen door shut . but it had blown that open. The sides of the fridge had ballooned out . and it was split at the back. ‘I was quite shaken up. I’m just glad I wasn’t in the kitchen at the time – it could’ve killed me. ‘I didn’t know what had happened and was worried there might be more explosions, so I rang 999.’ In a pickle: Margaret Goodwin, 66, pictured, woke to find her kitchen had been destroyed by an exploding jar of chutney . Baffled . firemen were left scratching their heads after the explosion on . Tuesday, having failed to find any fault with the fridge, until someone . asked Mrs Goodwin what she had left in it – and the penny dropped. Adrian . Green, technical manager of the Hanover retirement complex where Mrs . Goodwin lives, said: ‘Methane from the chutney was the only logical . cause. 'I spoke to the fire service and they agreed. It’s a real one-off. 'I’ve never come across anything like this before.  We’ve asked around to see if anyone else may have been given some of this chutney – obviously it doesn’t pay to have it knocking around too long.’ Dr John Emsley, a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, said: ‘Methane and air are highly explosive, but normally you’d have to have an electrical spark. Perhaps the light in the fridge was faulty. It’s a very rare occurrence.’ Mrs Goodwin, of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, said: ‘You wouldn’t think a little jar of rhubarb chutney could do such a thing. 'I thought the pressure building up in the fridge would force the door open to let the gases out, but the fire brigade tell me that when gases build up in a fridge, it actually makes the door seal itself even tighter.’ Mrs Goodwin, who will now have to redecorate, added: ‘The chutney tasted absolutely delicious, by the way.’ Fermentation: The explosion, which tore doors off their hinges, was caused by a build up of gasses in a jar of homemade rhubarb chutney which had been left in the fridge . PREPARATION TIME: Ten minutes. COOKING TIME: One hour. MAKES: Six jars. INGREDIENTS: 2lb (900g) rhubarb, 2lb (900g) sugar, 1lb (450g) sultanas, one pint of vinegar, 1oz (25g) salt, 1oz (25g) powdered ginger, one finely chopped onion, half a teaspoon of Cayenne pepper and half a teaspoon of ordinary pepper.

An outbreak of a measles-like virus affecting Bottlenose dolphins has become the largest in history - resulting in 753 dolphins washing up on beaches along the East Coast since July. And it's only getting worse. As Bottlenose herds migrate south for the winter, they may spread morbillivirus to local groups in Florida. The only other time an outbreak this bad happened was between August 1987 and April 1988 when the virus killed 740 dolphins. The current outbreak has already exceeded that death toll and if it plays out on the same time frame - it isn't even halfway over. Outbreak: Since July, 753 dolphins have washed up dead on East Coach beaches, most having died form a strain of a measles-like virus . Spreading: Researchers now fear that the outbreak will get worse with herbs moving south for the winter. Above, researchers conduct a necropsy on a dead dolphin in Virginia Beach, Virginia in August . Largest in history: The current outbreak has already eclipsed the last largest outbreak of morbillivirus which killed 740 dolphins between August 1987 and April 1988 . While the virus hasn't impacted other species of dolphins in the North and Mid-Atlantic, there is evidence that it may be killing some whales after the bodies of three humpback whales and two pygmy whales were recently found decaying on beaches. Researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) haven't been able to confirm yet whether these whales were suffering from the same virus since their bodes were 'very decomposed'. Teri Rowles, of the NOAA Fishers Marine Mammal Stranding Response Program, said in a conference call today that the number of dead beached whales is 'slightly' elevated' from usual but that it's too early to know if it's an outbreak in the whale population. Bottlenose dolphins continue to wash up on beaches on the East Coast, but more and more are showing up further south as the herds migrate to Florida for the winter. Researchers are now afraid that the outbreak will worsen and spread to local populations of dolphins in warmer waters. The virus spreads with contact and shared air. 'We don't know how this is going to play out,' Rowles said. Whales as well: Researchers believe that the virus may be spreading to humpback and pygmy whales, though it isn't impacting other species of dolphins . Too early to tell: NOAA researchers haven't been able to confirm a whale outbreak since the five stranded bodies were so decomposed, making it hard to analyze their tissue . Unfortunately, all researchers can do is watch the outbreak unfold. 'There is no vaccine that can be deployed for a large Bottlenose dolphin population or any cetacean species. Currently there is nothing that can be done to prevent the infection spreading, or prevent animals that get infected from having severe clinical disease,' she said. While the disease can't be spread to humans, it does have the potential to impact people. The virus leaves the dolphins susceptible to secondary diseases or viruses which have the possibility to infect humans if they come into contact with the rotting sea creatures on the beach. The NOAA recommends that any beached dolphins or whales be reported to local stranding coordinators. 'What we're trying to prevent people from doing is push them back out,' Rowles said. No help: Researchers say there is nothing they can do to prevent the outbreak from spreading .","Hundreds of dolphins have washed up on East Coast beaches since July .

Earlier this year teenager Dwayne Ward was subject to a horrific and bloody assault while on holiday in Turkey with his family. After Dwayne, 17, became separated from his brother Darren, 32, while out drinking on the famous Bar Street in the holiday resort of Marmaris he was approached by two Turkish men who proceeded to stab him 19 times, slash his body, face and neck with a razor blade, strip him naked and leave him for dead in a park. Dwayne's life was left hanging in the balance, all because he had kissed a local girl earlier in the evening. Earlier this year teenager Dwayne Ward was subject to a horrific assault while on holiday in Turkey with his family . Turkish surgeon Dr Selim Mavili, who carried out emergency life-saving surgery on Dwayne, from Middlesbrough, Cleveland, said the teen was 'lucky to be alive' when he arrived at the local hospital. The teenager made an incredible recovery, and left hospital just one week later, but the ordeal has left his family deeply shaken. Today Dwayne and his mother Doris appeared on ITV's This Morning to warn other tourists not to go to Bar Street and to beware of making themselves vulnerable. Dwayne and his mother Doris appeared on This Morning on Wednesday to warn other tourists to stay away from Marmaris's Bar Street . Doris said: 'We were happy on that first day,  I thought: this will be a holiday we will remember. 'The following day we went into the town centre to have a meal. We left the boys to it at 12:30, they wanted to have fun. Dwayne wanted to go to Bar Street, which is what teenagers do.' Doris, already concerned for her sons' safety, warned the boys to look after one another, and, most importantly, to stay together. She said: 'I was saying to them: ""Don't lose each other, stick together like glue.""' But the boys were soon separated, leaving Dwayne vulnerable. He told This Morning host Holly Willoughby: 'Mum left, we went down to Bar Street and went in a few bars and pubs.' The last thing Dwayne remembers is getting hit in the back of the head. His next moment of consciousness came when he awoke in a Turkish hospital with police by his bedside. Doris first realised that something might be wrong when Darren came back to the hotel alone asking where his brother was before flaking out on his bed, worse the wear from too much alcohol. Doris sais: 'I jumped up, started shouting at Darren, ""You've lost him!"" 'I got ready and went out looking for him. I hadn't been to that part of Marmaris before and went four or five blocks before I went back thinking I was going to get lost. 'I just sat waiting in the hotel. I knew something had happened. 'The man on reception said ""You're son has been arrested,"" I was quite relieved, at least I knew he was safe.' Horrifying: The naked body of Dwayne Ward, was discovered by horrified local residents in this public garden in Marmaris - he'd been stripped and stabbed more than a dozen times . Doris didn't see her son until eight hours later, she described the time as a surreal experience: 'I didn't feel like it was me standing there. It was like I was on the outside looking in.' With the help of the town's CCTV cameras the police were able to piece the evening together. Some footage showed Dwayne walking with some men, more footage showed him being dragged as his head lolled to one side. By this point he was unconscious. Two men Attila Dincer, 26, and another . named only as Ismail A, 24, have since admitted a series of offences including attempted murder and intent to kidnap. Dwayne suffers from regular flashbacks and is still on medication following the incident. His advice for other young people on holiday in the area is simple: 'Bar Street is dangerous. Don't go to Bar Street.' Dwayne was pictured leaving hospital with his family one week after the attack .","Dwayne Ward was found naked in a garden in the Tepe district of Marmaris .

Staying positive: Julia Roberts, a shopping channel presenter, is experiencing symptoms of post-polio syndrome . TV presenter Julia Roberts has an enviable, toned physique, but when you learn that as a child she was struck with polio, her fitness is even more impressive. The infectious disease attacks the nervous system and can lead to paralysis, disability and even death. At 14 months old, Julia spent 18 weeks in hospital and doctors predicted she would be disabled. But her parents refused to accept this. Incredibly, Julia became a dancer and fitness instructor before going into TV. 'I've never known if I was always destined to be a tough cookie and that's why I made a good recovery, or if having polio made me determined,' says Julia, 56, a QVC shopping channel presenter. But she has discovered that the disease she thought she'd overcome more than 50 years ago has a devastating sting in its tail - she's one of the 80 per cent of patients who, years later, experience a return of the symptoms of muscle loss, cramps, weakness and fatigue known as post-polio syndrome. Julia doesn't remember having polio, but knows she was close to death. 'In the summer of 1957 my mother noticed I'd stopped trying to pull myself up and walk and instead just wanted to sit,' says Julia, who lives with her partner Chris in Epsom, Surrey, and has two children, Daniel, 26, and Sophie, 25. She was rushed to hospital and put into isolation. Her parents, six-year-old sister and three-year-old brother could only look at her through a window on visits. 'To find out how I was, my parents had to read our local paper where there were lists of patients categorised as critically ill, dangerously ill and seriously ill,' she says. 'I was on the critically ill list. A fortnight later my father saw my name was gone. For a terrible moment they thought I hadn't made it, until they saw I'd been moved to “dangerously ill”.' After six weeks in isolation she was moved to a general ward. The polio affected Julia's left leg - the muscles had wasted so much it was shorter than the right. 'I was allowed home on Christmas Eve with my leg in a calliper. The doctors said I'd always have to wear it,' says Julia. Progress: Before the invention of the iron lung, a machine that fills lungs with air by making the chest rise, children with polio died frequently . 'But my parents heard about a hospital consultant teaching children who'd had polio to swim and dance, and signed me up. At home my mother spent hours each day doing physiotherapy to strengthen my leg muscles.' Gradually, Julia's leg improved and she started walking without the calliper. By the age of 11, her left leg was strong enough for her not to need special shoes. She played tennis and netball, danced and swam. Today, the only sign she has is a slight limp, and she doesn't wear high heels as she hasn't got enough control in her ankle to balance in them. Up to 45,000 people were infected by the poliomyelitis virus during the British outbreak in the Fifties, many of them children. In the majority of cases, the virus caused minor flu symptoms or 'abortive' polio - many had it without realising. However, 1 per cent of patients developed paralytic polio, says Professor Carolyn Young, a neurologist at the Walton Centre in Liverpool, which has a polio clinic. 'Here, the virus attacks the nervous system rather than just the throat, and the patient may become paralysed to such a degree they are unable to move or breathe. 'Before the invention of the iron lung [a machine that uses air pressure to make the chest rise, so the lungs can fill with air], these children would die.' Thanks to a vaccine programme in the Sixties, polio has been eradicated, though it remains a problem in Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan. But 80 per cent of survivors later experience post-polio syndrome, though doctors don't know why. The symptoms - pain and weakness, fatigue and muscle loss - can strike any time from 15 to 50 years after the initial disease. 'It may not be that it comes back, but that the recovery of the nervous system against the virus starts to fail as you age,' says Professor Young. 'It's a terrible double whammy. You struggle with this illness and overcome it, then later in life you may end up back in a wheelchair.' Julia knew nothing about this cruel after-effect until several years ago when, working for a local news station, she interviewed a man with the syndrome. 'I remember coming home and speaking to Chris about it and becoming tearful,' she says. 'The thought of polio coming back is really frightening.' Then, four years ago she noticed her right leg was numb. There is no definitive test for post-polio syndrome: diagnosis is based on symptoms. 'My GP hasn't confirmed it's post-polio syndrome yet, but I think I'm heading that way,' says Julia. 'I'm much more tired than I used to be and my left leg is thinner. If it gets any worse, I'll seek professional advice.' Though there is no cure, there are techniques for managing symptoms, such as mobility aids, and pacing, a type of physical therapy that helps with fatigue by reducing the pace of activity. Up to 120,000 people in Britain are thought to have the condition: 45,000 linked to the Fifties outbreak, with others affected before and after - the last reported case here was 1982. This is as many people as have Parkinson's disease, explains Ted Hill, chief executive of the British Polio Fellowship. Double misfortune: Many who survive polio the first time, like these two women in rehabilitation, will later experience post-polio syndrome . He says: 'We're even seeing some people who had the mild abortive form of polio developing post-polio syndrome with muscle pain and weakness. 'However, GPs don't recognise post-polio syndrome as well as they could. It's not taught in medical school because polio has been consigned to the history books. 'As a result, people affected are being told it's old age, so they may not get the support they need.' A survey by the British Polio Fellowship found 69 per cent of GPs rated their level of awareness of post-polio syndrome as low; 42  per cent said they would need to refer a suspected case to a neurologist for diagnosis. Eighteen months ago, Julia was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia, which typically develops very slowly, and she is taking chemotherapy tablets. 'It's muddied the waters for me as I feel incredibly tired and don't know whether it's the leukaemia or post-polio syndrome,' she says. Close up: The polio virus. Up to 120,000 people in Britain are thought to have the syndrome . 'Sometimes everything feels like a real effort and it takes me much longer to recover from exercise, so I'm having physiotherapy.' She wants to raise awareness of post-polio syndrome. 'If people know they've got it, they can manage their lives better. It's sad there's nothing that can be done about it, and it can be degenerative. We just don't know what that might mean for the future. I'm trying to take each day as it comes. 'In some respects, I feel lucky: I can still walk, do my job, think and write. I'm a positive person, and I've always had the mantra: “What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.” ' British Polio Fellowship: britishpolio.org.uk. Julia has written a book about her life, One Hundred Lengths Of The Pool, available through QVC or as an e-book.","Polio is an infectious disease that can lead to paralysis and disability .

Scotland wants the Bank of England to bail it out if there is another financial meltdown – even if the country breaks away from the UK. Scottish Nationalists are insisting they want to keep the pound as their currency and retain the Bank of England as the ‘lender of last resort’. But an influential committee of peers has warned it would be ‘implausible’ for the Bank to accept risks over which it had no control. It also attacked one of the main parts of Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond’s economic blueprint as ‘fanciful’. John Swinney (left), Scotland's finance minister, had told peers an independent Scottish government would expect the Bank of England to protect Scottish institutions if needed. Peers have attacked one of the main parts of Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond's (right) economic blueprint as 'fanciful' An influential committee of peers has warned it would be 'implausible' for the Bank (pictured) to accept risks over which it had no control . British people had a right to hear more about the debate over Scottish independence, the Lords economic affairs committee said in its report on the economic impact of Scottish independence. Peers called for arrangements over Scotland keeping sterling to be made clear before the referendum and warned the UK could be ‘sleepwalking’ into separation ‘if the issues are not tackled head on’. ‘It would be difficult to see how the UK government could extend central banking services to an independent Scotland since the UK government would lack control over the tax and spending policies of an independent Scotland,’ the committee said. John Swinney, Scotland’s finance minister, had told peers that an independent Scottish government would expect the Bank of England to protect Scottish institutions if needed. But the committee said: ‘This would require the Chancellor to put at risk taxpayers’ money from the rest of the UK for the benefit of institutions based, and possibly regulated in, an independent country. ‘The proposal for the Scottish Government to exert some influence over the Bank of England, let alone the rest of the UK exchequer, is devoid of precedent and entirely fanciful.’ Mr Swinney attacked the Lords for 'peddling nonsense', saying: 'All the evidence shows Scotland is in a far stronger financial position than the UK as a whole' Lord MacGregor, chairman of the economic affairs committee, said voters in the referendum on September 18, 2014 ‘deserve to cast their vote based on a proper understanding of the possible economic impact’. This included making voters aware that Scots would probably keep around 90 per cent of the North Sea oil and gas revenue because of where the resources are geographically located. With the volatility of oil pricing and supply, this resource alone would not guarantee that an independent Scotland would be a wealthy nation. The UK’s share of public sector net debt should also be allocated according to population, with Scots getting 8.4 per cent of it or £93billion out of £1,104billion. The committee also suggested Scotland should be lumbered with its share of private finance initiative and public sector pensions liabilities. This would double Scotland’s public sector net debt to £185.4billion. As a newly independent country with no credit history, Scotland would probably have to borrow money at rates higher than the UK does. Mr Swinney, however, attacked the Lords for ‘peddling nonsense’. He added: ‘All the evidence shows Scotland is in a far stronger financial position than the UK as a whole.’","Scottish Nationalists insist they want to keep pound as their currency .

Three decades ago, in an auditorium in California, Steve Jobs unveiled what was set to revolutionise home computing. The Macintosh computer had a 9-inch screen, used floppy disks and was powered by a 32-bit processor and 128KB RAM - all for $2,495. It replaced the need to type in commands with point-and-click menus, introduced drag and drop and launched the type of graphical user interface seen across PCs, phones, and tablets around the world today. Scroll down for video . The Macintosh computer, pictured, was unveiled in California in 1984. It featured a 9-inch screen and was powered by a 32-bit processor and 128KB RAM - all for $2,495. It replaced the need to type in commands with point-and-click menus and introduced drag and drop . On 22 January 1984, an advert for the Macintosh computer was shown during that year's Super Bowl. Directed by Ridley Scott, the advert ends with a message: 'On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984.' The 60-second ad alluded to Big . Brother from George Orwell's novel 1984 and was seen as a dig at Apple's . leading rival at the time, IBM. The Mac, the ad implied, would save . people from a computing future dominated by IBM. Apple's Macs never . succeeded in toppling IBM's PCs, which live on through clones made by . countless other manufacturers. But Macs did make a lasting impact. By . 1995, Windows PCs came to look much like Macs. It is still considered one of the best ads of all time ever, an athlete tries to save humanity from conformity. The first Mac also featured a 3.5-inch floppy disk drive, at a time when a 5.25-inches was the standard. The Mac used the smaller drive for practical reasons, as the larger floppies weren't reliable. By comparison, the iPad has a 9.7-inch screen and the current Mac Pro starts at 12BG of memory - more than 90,000 times as much as the 1984 model. To celebrate the event, Apple has created a Mac 30 mini site. The concepts seen in the original Macintosh are so fundamental today, it's hard to imagine a time when they existed only in research labs - primarily Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and his team got much of their inspiration from PARC, which they visited while designing the Mac. The Mac has had ‘incredible influence on pretty much everybody's lives all over the world since computers are now so ubiquitous,’ said Brad Myers, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute. ‘Pretty much all consumer electronics are adopting all of the same kinds of interactions.’ Apple didn't invent these tools, nor was the Mac the first to use them. Xerox sold its own mouse-based Star computer, and Apple's Lisa beat the Mac by months, but they were relative flops with consumers. Instead, the Mac prevailed and its success was attributed to the fact Apple engineers took the ideas from these earlier models and made them more user-friendly. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, left and John Sculley are shown presenting the Macintosh computer during a shareholder meeting in Cupertino, January 1984 . To celebrate the event, Apple has created a Mac 30 mini site, pictured. The original Macintosh is pictured left, with the current Mac pictured right. By comparison, the iPad has a 9.7-inch screen and the current Mac Pro starts at 12BG of memory - more than 90,000 times as much . In particular, Xerox used a three-button mouse in its Alto prototype computer, whereas Apple settled on one - allowing people to keep their eyes on the screen without worrying about which button to press. Its price was also a factor, and the Mac was four times cheaper than the Lisa. Apple insisted on uniformity, so copying and pasting text and deleting files would work the same way from one application to another. That reduced the time it would take to learn a new program. The Mac, pictured, featured a 3.5-inch floppy disk drive - at a time when a 5.25-inches were standard . Apple also put a premium on design. For example, early Macs showed a happy face when they started up and icons and windows had rounded corners. Such details made computers appear friendlier and easier to use - at least subconsciously - to the user, Myers said. One of the first applications enabled by the Mac's interface was desktop publishing. Early computers generated text the way a typewriter would - character by character, one line at a time. Users had a limited number of characters, with no variation in appearance. The Mac was one of the first to approach displays like a TV - text gets incorporated into a graphic that the computer projects on the screen pixel by pixel. Initially, many people 'thought it was a waste of time and a gimmick,' explained Dag Spicer, senior curator of the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley. He said long-time computer users already knew how to perform computing tasks 'very efficiently with just two or three keystrokes. It might have been more efficient for them than to use a mouse.' Tim Bajarin, a Creative Strategies analyst who has followed Apple for more than three decades, said he was baffled, yet intrigued when he saw the Mac's unveiling at an Apple shareholders meeting in 1984. In 1998, Apple unveiled the iMac, pictured. PCs at the time were typically housed in uniform, beige boxes. The first iMacs looked more like TVs and came in a variety of colors over the years . In July 2000 Steve Jobs unveiled Apple's 8-inch cube computer the Power Macintosh G4, pictured, during his keynote address at MacWorld Expo in New York. The Power Mac G4 Cube was praised for its design, even though it didn't sell well . Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, pictured, unveiled the latest Mac Pro  in San Francisco last year. It has 90,000 times more RAM than the original Macintosh . 'This really was a complete departure from the computing that we knew,' he said. 'None of us had any clue what its potential would be.' In fact, despite its radical interface, sales were lukewarm. For years, it was mostly a niche product for publishers, educators and graphics artists. Now the world's most valuable company, Apple nearly died in the 1990s as its market share dwindled. After a 12-year absence from Apple, Steve Jobs returned in 1997 to head the company. A year later, he introduced the iMac, a desktop computer with shapes and colours that departed from beige Windows boxes at the time. Then came the iPod music player in 2001, the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad tablet in 2010. In recent years, PCs have declined as consumers turn to mobile devices. Apple sold 16 million Macs in the year ending 28 September, down 10 per cent from a year earlier. By contrast, iPhones sales grew 20 per cent to 150 million and iPads by 22 per cent to 71 million. The Mac has aged to the point that it's starting to draw inspiration from iPhones and iPads. Several Mac apps have been refined to look and work more like mobile versions. Macs now have notifications and other features born on mobile devices. Windows computers, meanwhile, now emphasise tablets' touch-base interfaces.","The original Macintosh computer was launched on 24 January 1984 .

The American said: 'A blond grizzly bear is an extremely rare occurrence. 'What we see in the pictures is an . even rarer-sight of a blond coloured grizzly bear interacting with a . standard brown coloured grizzly bear. 'They are actually not fighting, but are playing on a huge tidal mudflat. 'This went on for several hours until the afternoon sun eventually set. 'They then went from playing to fishing for food.'

'People find it unbelievable that I have had these experiences and captured these images. 'They often cannot imagine being in that situation, and I feel my images allow a window into my experience.' Among the other intimate moments caught . on camera are a polar bear appearing to wave at the camera and a pair of . male grizzlies going head-to-head as they fight for territory. One particularly stunning picture shows a mother black bear and her two cubs walking past a glacier.

'The stories are explained visually in the book - with great composition, great lighting, great behaviour and action. The most common species is the black bear, with over a million believed to survive in the wild. Grizzly bear numbers are thought to total 200,000 and are not at risk of extinction at this time. Polar bears, however, are endangered. There are currently only an estimated . 25,000 polar bears left in the wild as the ice they depend for hunting . continues to disappear. Nature-lover Mr Kazlowski said he wanted to release the book to reveal the softer side of the creature that is normally hidden from view. He said: 'My message is pretty simple - it's that these animals are not cold blooded killers. 'We can peacefully coexist with bears, and enjoy a richer world with the diversity in species they offer us. 'My goal is to create awareness and . promote conservation of natural environments by making striking images . that connect people to places and animals.

Clare and Rachel Wallmeyer, 42, were killed after a fire broke out in their home in Geelong, near Melbourne, one perishing in the flames, the other succumbing to her severe burns on the way to hospital. It was a tragic end to two turbulent lives, for the sisters had appeared on Australian TV several times to talk about the anorexia which had turned both into virtual living skeletons and a problem pair for their parents, social workers and the police.

'At least we'll die together': Twins predicted their sad demise . In a poignant review of their lives they said in recent years that they had never been in love, never had a job and they believed that it was only a matter of time before they died – and they would die together. Their deaths in the fire are believed to have been accidental, according to detectives from the Geelong Crime Investigation Unit who said that initial checks did not reveal any suspicious activity. Yet there had been reports over the years of the women each trying to kill one another. Rachel was charged with the attempted . murder of Clare after police, who were called to their home, claimed . they witnessed Rachel with her hands locked around her sister’s throat. The charge was later withdrawn. Their existence, balanced between . life and death, had resulted in TV companies searching them out for . interviews after authorities considered jailing them in an attempt to . stop the women starving themselves to death and ‘turn their lives . around.’ In fact Clare . was later jailed by a Geelong court for a series of thefts – but only . after magistrate Ian von Einem said he saw no option but to send her to . prison to stop her from self-destructing. Her . sister also presented a headache for the authorities when she was . arrested for driving under the influence of drugs and was also accused . of pushing a victim on to train tracks. She received a 21-month suspended . jail sentence. The . women, who were compulsive long-distance runners, described themselves . as perfectionists in biomedical science and physical education, topics . they studied avidly, side by side. But as they started to waste away . over two decades, the weight of each of them dropped to little more than . four stone. Doctors said they had the bone structure of women aged . between 70 and 100. The . twins developed severe eating disorders in their early teens losing more . weight when they became addicted to long-distance running. They were so . obsessed with marathons that they each suffered stress fractures in . their feet.

Inseparable to their tragic end, . there was the time in 1996 when Rachel was so ill she was admitted to a . psychiatric unit at the Royal Melbourne Hospital – followed by Clare who . voluntarily admitted herself too. Rachel told Melbourne’s Herald Sun . newspaper on one occasion that no-one understood anorexia until they . have lived it. ‘It’s like the Grim Reaper – a black hole in your soul,’ she said. Their . parents, Bob and Moya admitted that when the twins were teenagers they . feared they would find them dead in bed because of their disorder.

We might have a piece of watermelon.’ Rachel added: ‘And Diet Coke we have, and coffee.’ They also revealed they took at least 20 laxatives. Rachel said that Clare was the only person who remained by her side. ‘And at least we’ll die together.’ Clare said: ‘Being with Rachel…makes it somewhat easier to die.’","Clare and Rachel Wallmeyer, 42, died when fire swept through their home in Geelong, near Melbourne .

No clemency: Edgar Tamayo will be executed for murdering Houston police officer Guy Gaddis in 1994 . A Mexican held on death-row in a Texan prison for murdering a policeman will be executed tonight despite last-ditch appeals from lawyers for clemency. Edgar Arias Tamayo, 46, was set for lethal injection this evening for shooting of Guy Gaddis, 24, in January 1994. The case has been a focus of protests in his home town and diplomatic pressure, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry calling for a delay to Tamayo's execution. Tamayo's lawyers had lodged an appeal arguing that he was ineligible for the death penalty due to mental impairment. But a court ruled the appeal had been filed too late. Gaddis, who had been on the force for two years, was driving Tamayo and another man from a robbery scene when evidence showed the officer was shot three times in the head and neck with a pistol Tamayo had concealed in his pants. The car crashed, and Tamayo fled on foot but was captured a few blocks away, still in handcuffs, carrying the robbery victim's watch and wearing the victim's necklace. Tamayo's attorneys and the Mexican government contend Tamayo's case was tainted because he wasn't advised under an international agreement that he could get legal help from his home nation following his arrest. Secretary of State John Kerry previously asked Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott to delay Tamayo's punishment, saying it 'could impact the way American citizens are treated in other countries.' The State Department repeated that stance Tuesday. But Abbott's office and the Harris County district attorney opposed postponing what would be the first execution this year in the nation's most active capital punishment state, where 16 people were put to death in 2013. At least two other inmates in similar circumstances were executed in Texas in recent years. The Mexican government said in a statement this week it 'strongly opposed' the execution and said failure to review Tamayo's case and reconsider his sentence would be 'a clear violation by the United States of its international obligations.' Scroll down for video . Pleas for mercy: A woman holds up a sign showing a photo of Texas death-row inmate Edgar Tamayo that reads in Spanish 'The town of Miacatlan offers you our support, during a protest demanding clemency . Mexican officials and Tamayo's attorneys contend he was protected under a provision of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Legal assistance guaranteed under that treaty could have uncovered evidence to contest the capital murder charge or provide evidence to keep Tamayo off death row, they said. Rejected: A request by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, pictured, to delay Tamayo's punishment was rejected . 'We are continuing to pursue our options for appeal, and vindication of Mr Tamayo's right to review of the consular rights violation in his case,' said Maurie Levin, one of Tamayo's lawyers. Tamayo's attorneys previously appealed to a federal court in Austin for an injunction against Gov. Rick Perry and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, which he appoints. The board can recommend Perry grant clemency, but it's an action they rarely take. A judge rejected that lawsuit Tuesday. 'It doesn't matter where you're from,' Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said. 'If you commit a despicable crime like this in Texas, you are subject to our state laws, including a fair trial by jury and the ultimate penalty.' Tamayo was in the U.S. illegally and had a criminal record in California, where he had served time for robbery and was paroled, according to prison records. 'Not one person is claiming the suspect didn't kill Guy Gaddis,' Ray Hunt, president of the Houston Police Officers' Union, said. 'He had the same rights as you and I would have. 'This has been looked at, heard, examined and it's time for the verdict of the jury to be carried out.' Tamayo was among more than four dozen Mexican nationals awaiting execution in the U.S. when the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled in 2004 they hadn't been advised properly of their consular rights. The Supreme Court subsequently said hearings urged by the international court in those inmates' cases could be mandated only if Congress implemented legislation to do so. 'Unfortunately, this legislation has not been adopted,' the Mexican foreign ministry acknowledged.","Edgar Tamayo is scheduled for lethal injection at a Texas prison .

Now there's a new source of sustenance to add to the list - an Ethiopian cereal named teff. Loved by Gwyneth Paltrow and Victoria Beckham, the grain, which is a staple food in its home country Ethiopia, is packed with protein, calcium and iron. It does, however, come with a Hollywood style price tag - retailing at an eye-watering £7 for a 400g bag of flour. Superfood: Teff, an Ethiopian staple, is set to be 2014's coolest cupboard essential according to foodies . Dubbed the 'new quinoa', teff, which was used to feed animals until recently, has also found favour with foodies who point to its nutty flavour and wide range of uses. But although it has made inroads with the A-list, the rest of us don't appear quite so keen to follow suit with Planet Organic's Toby Watts saying people still aren't fully aware of the health benefits. 'It has been a slow start,' he admits. 'We are often the first . to offer new products so there is always a strong need to educate . customers and this takes time, much the same as when we first listed . quinoa and people pronounced it qui-no-a, but our customers are quick to . catch on.' He added: 'The market . for gluten-free has soared in the past couple of years, but many . retailers have turned to white rice and corn as a wheat substitute. 'What . our customers are seeking are gluten-free wholegrain alternatives which . offer much higher nutritional benefits and teff, like quinoa, fits the . criteria.' A-list fans: Gwyneth Paltrow and Victoria Beckham are both fans of the Ethiopian staple . Traditional: Teff is used to make injera, a flat bread used like medieval trenchers as both plate and side dish . But it seems that British shoppers aren't the only ones who need a lesson in the nutritional benefits of Teff. Sophie Kebede owner of Tobia Teff, has been eating the super food her whole life but admits she had no idea it had so much to recommend it, telling the Guardian that she was 'flabbergasted' when she discovered its nutritional value. 'I didn't know it was so sought after,' she revealed. 'I am of Ethiopian origin; I've been eating injera [traditional Ethiopian bread made from Teff] all my life.' Despite its nutritional advantage over contenders such as millet, spelt and quinoa, teff does have one downside - a higher calorie count. With 286 calories per cup, teff is positively fattening  compared bulgar wheat's meagre 152 calories and quinoa's 222. That, however, is no reason to forgo tucking into teff, according to Kebede, who argues that its nutritional value more than makes up for the extra calories. 'I’m a big advocate of trying it in more traditional Western dishes so everyone can enjoy the associated health improvements,' she explains. 'The teff cereals can be enjoyed on their own, or mixed into a regular muesli for a nutritious start to the day, for example; and our breads run from plain to onion seed, sunflower seed or raisin bread, so there are options for toast and sandwiches as well as afternoon tea.' WHAT IS IT? Teff is classified as a variety of millet. It has small, round grains.WHY . IT'S GOOD FOR YOU: . It is unlikely to cause allergies and is easy to . digest.

Income tax would have to rise by a crippling 9 pence in an independent Scotland to plug a £3billion financial black hole, a damning report has warned. An ageing population and falling revenues from North Sea oil would mean big spending cuts and steep tax rises, the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has predicted. There would be a fiscal gap in Scotland of 1.9 per cent of national income compared to 0.8 per cent of national income in the UK. Pressure: Alex Salmond, First Minister of Scotland, faces fresh warnings of the economic impact of independence . The tax rise of nine percentage points would be needed to fill the difference of income and expenditure, the IFS said. Other options include raising VAT to 28 per cent and cutting eight per cent in public services spending. Gemma Tetlow, IFS programme director and author of the report, said: ‘An independent Scotland would face even tougher choices than those faced by the UK over the longer term.’ Anti-separation campaigners seized on the IFS’ analysis, saying it left the pro-independence camp’s economic arguments ‘in tatters’. Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney said that Scotland could have performed better if it had been independent since the 1970s . Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the report proved that independence would ‘condemn Scotland to a long period of non-stop austerity and spending cuts’. ‘I don’t think the break-up of Britain is inevitable,’ the Lib Dem leader said. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, a Scottish MP,  added: ‘Even on the most optimistic scenario, an independent Scotland would require cuts almost two and a half times as deep than if they stayed in the UK.’ Former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, said: ‘This sober and impartial analysis by the IFS leaves the SNP’s economic case for independence in tatters. This is a risk that we don’t need to take.’ In the coming days, the SNP will suggest Scotland could have missed out on economic growth worth more than £900 per person as a result of Westminster’s handling of the economy. The Scottish Government is preparing to publish a report on the economic powers that leaving the UK would provide and how it believes these could be used to boost growth and jobs. Finance secretary John Swinney said: ‘The IFS themselves admit their projections in this report are “inherently uncertain” and could evolve differently if Scotland were independent rather than part of the UK.’ Poll: Voters in Scotland will have their say on independence in a referendum on 18 September next year . The IFS said: ‘Public spending per . head is higher in Scotland than the rest of the UK while taxation of . onshore activity raises a similar amount per head. ‘In . 2011-12 the difference between spending levels in Scotland and the rest . of the UK was more than made up by higher revenues from the North Sea . in Scotland if allocated on a geographic basis. ‘However, . the outlook for public borrowing in future is less favourable for . Scotland than for the UK as a whole because of demographic pressures and . the likely decline of revenues from the North Sea over the longer . term.’","Tax hikes and spending cuts needed to plug financial blackhole .

Disgraced cycling champion Lance Armstrong has been spotted for the first time since coming clean about his years of using performance-enhancing drugs in an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey last week. Hiding beneath a pair of sunglasses and a dark baseball cap, Armstrong was seen boarding a private plane in Hawaii with his girlfriend, 31-year-old Anna Hansen, and their two young children. Armstrong, 41, kept his head down as he carried luggage from his car and hugged friends farewell, while Hansen looked relaxed and even flashed a smile. Spotted: Lance Armstrong has been seen boarding a private jet in Hawaii with his girlfriend and their children . Armstrong, who was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles as the revelations about his drug use emerged, was also joined by the youngest two of his five children, Maxwell, 3, and Olivia, 2. The family is believed to have been staying in a luxury private home in the district of Kona to hide from growing speculation over Armstrong's use of doping. 'Lance did not want to be seen and was keeping a very low profile when he arrived at the airport,' one onlooker said. 'They arrived in a large SUV and he and Anna were both trying to be low key. 'She had leggings on and wore sunglasses . while Lance also looked like an ordinary member of the public dressed . down in jeans and a T-shirt.' In hiding: Armstrong hid beneath a baseball cap and sunglasses as he prepared to board the flight . Family: They were pictured with their two children, Maxwell, three, and Olivia, two, and relatives . Hansen, whom Armstrong met through his . charity work for cancer, fell pregnant with Maxwell in 2008 - even . though it was believed Armstrong could no longer have children after . undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer. Amstrong also has three older children, Luke and twins Isabella and Grace, with his ex-wife Kristin, from whom he separated in 2003. His . appearance is the first since his explosive interview with Oprah . Winfrey, in which he finally admitted to using performance-enhancing . substances. 'I view this situation as one big lie . that I repeated a lot of times,' he said in an televised interview with . Winfrey screened on January 17. He admitted that he doped in some . form for each of his seven Tour de France victories, though he . maintained that the last time that he 'crossed that line' was in 2005. Staying together: His girlfriend of five years, Anna Hansen, has stood by her man despite the revelations . Emergence: Armstrong is believed to have been in Hawaii with his family for the past few months . Disgraced: It has been a week since Armstrong admitted to taking performance-enhancing substances . Packing up: Maxwell as his mother, who met Armstrong through his charity work, unloads the car . The distinction of before and after . 2005 is important as that was the last year that capped off his . incredible seven-year winning streak at the Tour de France. On top of the outright confession, he . said that part of the reason why it carried on for as long as it did was . because he 'didn't feel like' he was cheating. 'The definition of cheat is to gain . an advantage on a rival or foe that they didn't have. I didn't view it . that way. I viewed it as a level playing field,' he said. He described the elaborate doping ring . that he and his teammates developed was not quite as legendary as the . investigatory commissions described it. 'It was definitely professional and . it was definitely smart if you can call it that but it was very . conservative, very risk averse, and very aware of what mattered,' he . said. Heading home? Hansen fell pregnant with in 2008 - even though it was believed Armstrong could not have children after having chemotherapy for cancer . Relaxed: Hansen managed to smile as they boarded the jet despite the scandal surrounding her boyfriend . Support: Relatives said farewell to the family before they boarded the private jet from Hawaii . Trip: The family are believed to have been staying in a luxury private home on the tropical island of Kona . 'While I've lived through this process ... I know the truth the truth isn’t what is out there, the truth isn't what I said. 'I didn't invent the culture but I . didn't try to stop the culture and that's my mistake. The sport is now . paying the price for that, and I am sorry for that. 'This story was so perfect for so . long- and I mean that as I try to take myself out of this situation- . it’s this mythic, perfect story and that wasn't true, on a lot of . levels.' While he admitted in the interview that his seven Tour de France titles between 1999 and 2005 were drug-fuelled, he denied that he was still doping in his comeback 2009 and 2010 Tours. But John Fahey, head of the World Anti-Doping Agency, claimed this is a lie. Confession: Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that his seven Tour de France titles were won with the help of performance-enhancing drugs, but he denied that he used them for his 2009 comeback . Shamed: Armstrong told Oprah that he never tried to stop or change the culture of drug use in the sport . 'The evidence from . USADA is that Armstrong's blood tests show with absolute certainty that . he was doping after 2005,' he said within hours of the interview being . aired. 'It struck me that . the statute of limitations under U.S. law might be relevant and . Armstrong would not want to admit to anything in regards to his comeback . that could be picked up under the US criminal code. This bloke is a . cheat. Did my view change after watching the interview? No.' In light of the confession, two men . this week filed a lawsuit against Armstrong and his book publishers, . charging that they were duped by the disgraced cyclist's deceptions. Rob Stutzman and Jonathan . Wheeler, both of California, claim that the pages of Armstrong's . best-selling memoirs are nothing but lies after he confessed last week . to systematic doping in a landmark interview with Queen of Talk Oprah . Winfrey. In the spotlight: Armstrong's ex-fiancee Sheryl Crow jets out of Los Angeles this morning, days after she revealed that she felt bad for her former flame and the people he had deceived . The class-action complaint was filed in federal court in Sacramento, California on Tuesday. Mr Stutzman is a public relations . executive who served as a deputy chief of staff for former California . Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Mr Wheeler is a chef and amateur . cyclist. They said they . bought the books 'It's Not About the Bike' and 'Every Second Counts' because they believed in Armstrong and his story of returning without . drug assistance to the Tour de France after a nearly fatal bout with . testicular cancer. Following . Armstrong's doping confession, however, Stutzman and Wheeler said they . felt 'duped,' 'cheated' and 'betrayed' by the realization that the . books, marketed as inspirational true-life memoirs, were replete with . fabrications. Brood: Armstrong is pictured with his ex-wife Kristin and his other three children - son Luke and daughters Isabella Rose and Grace Elizabeth in 2003 after winning his fifth Tour de France . Their lawsuit . accuses Armstrong and his publishers, Penguin and Random House, of . violating consumer protection laws on false advertising and fraud by . selling the books as works of non-fiction. Lawyers for the purported class of . Armstrong book buyers say readers are entitled to restitution and . possibly statutory and punitive damages for deceptions. They . say the publishers should have detected these, even though Armstrong . passed drug screenings for various international cycling competitions. A . similar lawsuit was filed in 2011 against Greg Mortenson, co-author of . the best seller Three Cups of Tea, accusing him of fabricating much of . his story about promoting education for impoverished girls in Pakistan . and Afghanistan. Scam: Two readers have brought a lawsuit against Armstrong for lying in his memoirs, pictured . That suit, which alleged fraud and unjust enrichment, was dismissed last year by a federal judge in Montana. Penguin . will be represented in the Armstrong suit by the firm Dorsey & . Whitney, which won the Mortenson case for his publisher. Dorsey partner Jonathan Herman . declined to comment on how the publisher will respond to the Armstrong . complaint's California-law claims but said, 'As far as we're concerned, . this is also a case that should be dismissed.' Also this week, an Australian bookstore made headlines after it announced it would begin moving Armstrong's books into the fiction section. Legal battles: Armstrong has been sued by a Dallas-based SCA Promotions to recover more than $12million in bonuses and by The Sunday Times in London to recover a libel judgment that Armstrong won .

Low numbers: Dr Ion Jinga, Romania's ambassador in Britain, says only two dozen of his countrymen have entered the UK since January 1 . Fewer than 25 Romanians have entered Britain since labour market restrictions were relaxed on January 1, according to the country's ambassador in London. Dr Ion Jinga claims the predicted rush of his countrymen to the UK after EU border controls were relaxed has not happened. The diplomat also says that ten companies have contacted his London embassy trying to get Romanians to work for them, and they have been forced to direct them to the Jobcentre. British border officials have not published figures showing how many Romanians and Bulgarians have entered the country since New Year's Day. But in Holland they say that 21 from Romania and 15 from Bulgaria have arrived in the past two weeks, and Mr Jinga says it will be similar for the UK. 'I do not see any reason why Holland would be less attractive than the . UK, with the geographic proximity playing in favour of the Dutch. What . we know is that on the flight into Luton airport on Jan 1, only two . Romanians took advantage of the lifting of border restrictions in . Britain,' he told the Daily Telegraph. Mr Jinga said that companies who have contacted them were urged by Romanian officials to advertise in the Jobcentre, not directly through them. 'British companies are currently advertising 5,000 posts for Romanians to plug gaps in the highly skilled jobs market,' he said. Romania is trying its hardest to stop a surge of its nationals leaving the country for the rest of the EU to keep its own economy stable. But the promise of higher wages elsewhere is difficult to resist now controls on movement were lifted. Victor Spirescu, 30, was treated to Costa Coffee by Labour MP Keith Vaz when he landed in England on New Year's Day after labour market restrictions were relaxed. He insisted he was here to work and not 'rob your country' when he arrived and said he was off to clean cars outside Aldi in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire.

Mr Clarke, who sits in the Cabinet as the prime minister’s trade envoy, said: ‘I just don’t think it’s true that the European Union is responsible for unacceptable waves of migration. The idea that you can have some fundamental debate that somehow stops all these foreigners coming here is rather typical right-wing, nationalist escapism.’ It caused a clash with Foreign Secretary William Hague, who insisted the lifting of controls on incomers from eastern European countries who joined the EU had triggered ‘large-scale migration’ and had been a ‘mistake’. But Laszlo Andor, the EU’s social affairs commissioner, suggested Britons were ‘emotional and misguided’ over the issue and would ‘pay more attention to the facts’ in the absence of a big influx from Bulgaria and Romania.","Dr Ion Jinga says influx of migrants since January 1 never happened .

Even if parents enjoy a close relationship with their son and daughter, harsh verbal discipline was found have a dramatic impact on their teens emotional development, a study found. This form of discipline can vary from yelling and shouting at a child, to swearing and using words to humiliate them. Damaging: A study found that parents tend to move from physical discipline to verbal as their children become teenagers (file picture) Scientists looked at 976 two-parent families in the US, the majority of which were middle-class. They found that many shifted from physical to verbal discipline as their children entered adolescence. They also discovered that more severe forms of harsh verbal discipline were commonplace, and directed at teens in nearly half of households. The researchers found if parents use such punishment when their child is 13, the teen is more likely to have behavioural or emotional problems later on. These youngsters tended to suffer more depressive symptoms between ages 13 and 14 than children who were not disciplined in this manner, while they were also more likely to have conduct problems such as misbehaving at school, lying, stealing, or fighting. Effect: Children whose parents shout at them are more likely to suffer symptoms of depression according to the study . ‘This is one of the first studies to indicate that parents’ harsh verbal discipline is damaging to the developing adolescent,’ said lead researcher Dr Ming-Te Wang, assistant professor of psychology in education at the University of Pittsburgh. ‘The notion that harsh discipline is without consequence, once there is a strong parent-child bond-that the adolescent will understand that ‘they’re doing this because they love me’-is misguided because parents’ warmth didn’t lessen the effects of harsh verbal discipline. ‘Indeed, harsh verbal discipline appears to be detrimental in all circumstances.’ The study, published in the journal Child Development, found that not only does harsh verbal discipline appear to be ineffective at addressing behaviour issues, it may actually add to the problem. Even if the parents were close to their child, this form of discipline still caused emotional damage. The report concluded: ‘Maternal and paternal warmth did not moderate the longitudinal associations between mothers’ and fathers’ use of harsh verbal discipline and adolescent conduct problems and depressive symptoms.’ The researchers suggested parents’ hostility could actually lead to an increase in the risk of delinquency, by lowering inhibition and fostering anger, irritability, and belligerence in adolescents. During the experiment, teens and their parents completed surveys over a two-year period on topics related to their mental health, child rearing practices, and the quality of the parent-child relationship. Approximately 90 per cent of American parents admit one or more instances of harsh verbal discipline towards their children. Dr Wang suggests parents who want to discipline their teenage children would benefit by talking with them about their concerns and the consequences of the behaviour. He said the findings could influence future parenting programmes and encourage alternative methods of punishment to shouts and insults.","Scientists looked at 976 mostly middle class two parent families in the U.S .

Police have seized scissors and knives from the home of a 21-year-old woman charged with dismembering and strangling her newborn son moments after delivering the baby in the bathroom. 'Horrific crime': Lillian Alvarado, 21, has charged with dismembering her newborn son on Thanksgiving last year . Lillian Alvarado has been ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation after she was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and cruelty to children on Thursday, months after police first stumbled upon the shocking crime in northwest Washington. Police were first called to Alvarado's apartment in the 6400 block of 14th Street NW on November 28 after downstairs neighbors complained of bloody water dripping from the ceiling. Authorities said cops arrived at the apartment just before noon on Thanksgiving and that, once Alvarado could be coaxed out of the bathroom, she sat on the bed and said 'forgive me', The Washington Post reported. It was then police found the dead baby, with umbilical cord still attached, lying in an inch of blood and water in the bathtub, with a pair of scissors in the sink. Alvarado’s 70-year-old father, Santiago Alvarado, said family members thought his daughter was taking a shower that morning. He said that she has a history of mental illness and that during episodes, she is unable to communicate. Alvarado came to the United States from El Salvador about a year ago, the father said, fleeing the violence in her native country, where her husband was killed. Scene: Lillian Santiago lived with relatives in the 6400 block of 14th Street NW, Washington. Family members said they believed she was showering on the morning on November 28, when the alleged crime occurred . She made a living cleaning houses in the Washington area and 'worked very hard', he said. Alvarado told her father she didn't know she was pregnant and that the baby was stillborn. However on Thursday the medical examiner said there were air bubbles found in the infant's lungs, meaning that he had died after the birth. The autopsy also found that the newborn’s neck had been compressed, and there were signs of drowning. The cause of death was determined as dismemberment and asphyxiation. Alvarado told police that she knew she was pregnant in April or May, and she believed that by November she was seven months along, according to court documents obtained by The Post. She said she woke up at 6 am on Thanksgiving with a sharp pain and told others in the home that she was sick from something she ate. She later went into the bathroom, where her water broke. According to the charging documents, Alvarado got into the shower, thinking she was about to go to the hospital, and that the baby was born there. The affidavit says she told police she cut the umbilical cord with scissors and did not hear the baby cry. She told police that she remembers hitting her head on the sink as she got out of the tub and flushing the toilet, but then 'everything went dark'. Relatives told police that Alvarado went in and out of the bathroom all morning, once asking for a pair of pants, another time fetching a plunger from a hall closet. 'This was a horrific crime that occurred on Thanksgiving Day to an innocent child killed by his mother,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Cynthia Wright said at a D.C. Superior Court hearing, arguing that the suspect is a danger to the community. Santiago Alvarado said his daughter has a history of mental illness. 'She has mental disturbances sometimes, and when that happens, she doesn’t talk,' the father said in Spanish. 'She goes out of her mind. The doctors diagnosed her with a sickness.' He said he did not know the official diagnosis. Lillian Alvarado has a two-year-old daughter who was taken by social workers the same day the baby was born, he said. Santiago Alvarado said that his daughter was hospitalized for about a month after the baby’s death and that he just received a bill for $24,000. They have not spoken since her arrest.","Police first called to the Washington home of Lillian Alvarado, 21, on November 28, 2014 .

Scientists have revealed the optical trickery behind an 'invisibility cloak' that has been shown to make a kitten and goldfish mysteriously disappear. In a video demonstrating the team of Chinese and Singaporean researchers' work, a kitten and goldfish are hidden from view using the 'cloak' - which is not like the flowing material version worn by Harry Potter but carefully arranged thin panels of glass. The cloak works by bending light around an object in the centre of a specially-designed glass construction to make it invisible to a viewer. Scroll down for video . Scientists have revealed the optical trickery behind an invisibility 'cloak' that has been shown to make a kitten (pictured) and goldfish mysteriously 'disappear' The video of the disappearing animals had baffled some viewers, but now the scientists behind the 'magic' have revealed the shape of the device and how it works. The video begins by showing a kitten seemingly disappearing behind a cloak or tubular screen and then a goldfish swimming until it disappears inside a similar cloak so that only its wriggling tail remains visible to the viewer. Researchers from the Zhejiang University, China and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore have found a way to use light refraction to render objects invisible using their cloak, which is actually a cleverly-designed hexagonal array of panels of glass. A diagram to explain how the illusion was created. The scientists used light refraction to render the kitten invisible - which sits in the middle of an array of carefully-angled pieces of glass - designed to bend the light around the animal . The goldfish in the video appears to disappear behind the invisibility cloak, leaving just its wiggling tail visible . Zheng Bin, a researcher at Zhejiang University, told China View that the light humans see bounces off an object before it reaches our eyes. 'We found that if we could control the path of the light, we could make the object invisible.' He said this means that they have worked to make the light bypass the object they want to hide, but still enable the light to reach a human's eyes. Here the mystery of how the goldfish disappears is revealed. Light enters the hexagonal 'cloak' and when the goldfish enters, it bends around the object . Taken out of the goldfish tank, it is possible to see the composition of the invisibility device and its clever construction, which consists of carefully-placed plates of glass . Dr Bin said: 'When light goes through this device it disperses sideways and follows a certain path to reach the same point as if it didn't encounter any objects, so visually it seems that the object inside has disappeared. Researchers from the Zhejiang University, China and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, made the 'cloak' from glass as it is transparent, and does not need to be impregnated with expensive nanotechnology, as human eyes are not sensitive to light's minute delay, Shanghaiist reported. Chen Hongsheng, team leader of the research at the university, said the invisibility effect is currently only apparent if one looks at the object from a certain direction. A diagram showing how the device works. When light goes through the device it disperses sideways and follows a certain path to reach the same point as if it didn't encounter any objects, so visually it seems that the object inside it (the light blue hexagonal space at the centre of the structure, which is hollow) has disappeared . Here, it is possible to see the beam of light bending around the hexagonal structure. It is this optical effect, which means the object at the hexagon's centre (such as a goldfish) is hidden from view . 'There are six angles from which objects can be cloaked,' he said. The scientists said that they plan on working on the device to make it more effective and add more useable angles as well as making the 'cloak' lighter. However, the device is more sophisticated than previous attempts that only work with polarised light or microwaves, which humans cannot see. The team hopes that one day the technology can be developed to ensure that objects cannot . be seen from any angle and they claim it could have important security, . entertainment, and surveillance applications. It might be some time until we can wear flexible invisibility cloaks - as seen modelled by Daniel Radcliffe in HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE. But the scientists hope their glass invention will have important security, surveillance and entertainment functions in the future .

Peter Moores has emerged as a leading candidate to make a shock return to the helm of the England cricket team by replacing Andy Flower as coach. Moores, sacked by England five years ago after Kevin Pietersen’s attempt to oust him, has rebuilt his reputation at Lancashire as one of the best coaches in the domestic game. Sportsmail understands he would love to have a second crack at the biggest job in English cricket and the ECB, who feel he was hard done by last time, will seriously consider his claims when they begin interviewing later this month. Not each other's cup of tea: Ousted: Kevin Pietersen (right) attempted to have Peter Moores removed as England coach during his first stint . Let's sit down and talk about it: Moores in discussion with Pietersen in the Oval nets in 2007 . Happier times: Moores and Pietersen have a chuckle in the nets at Old Trafford in 2008 . Return? Moores, who was England coach between 2007 and 2009, is in line to replace Andy Flower . Moores, whose methods did alienate some senior players other than Pietersen, is particularly adept at working with emerging talent which may add to his claims of landing a job with a ‘new’ England team. Ashley Giles, who has enhanced his claims on the top job by backing the decision to sack Pieteren, remains the hot favourite and would be a popular choice among players who have enjoyed working with him in one-day cricket. Winner: peter Moores with the County Championship trophy he won with Lancashire in 2011 . Paul Collingwood, cutting his coaching teeth with Scotland, looks sure to feature in England’s new coaching team, either as Giles' assistant if the one-day supremo lands the job or possibly as batting coach. But the strong support within the team and the ECB for Giles will not stop England advertising the job next week, with managing director Paul Downton using head hunters in an attempt to attract the biggest names in world coaching. It seems increasingly likely that Downton will not be able to consider the outstanding candidate for the job in Gary Kirsten, who again distanced himself from the England job on Friday. ‘It would have been a great challenge,’ the former India and South Africa coach told Sky Sports. ‘It’s a pressurised role and I think over many years Andy Flower did an exceptional job. I had many chats with Andy and I enjoyed his way. ‘I have often wondered if I could go in there with my coaching philosophies and seeing if it could work in that environment. I would have enjoyed that challenge. But I’m taking on an IPL team in Delhi Daredevils – thank goodness it’s for a shorter spell of time – and I’m really looking forward to it.’ Yet, as Martin Samuel pointed out in these pages earlier in the week, Kirsten did not actually say no and if Downton decides that he really is the exceptional candidate then it would be intriguing to see what would happen if the ECB threw money at him. Moores the merrier: The coach, stood in front of the old Old Trafford pavilion in 2009, has restored his reputation . Peter Moores's Test record as England coach: . Played 22 won 8 lost 6 drawn 8 . Series won: 3 (out of 7) Kirsten earns £300,000 for just six weeks with Delhi and works as a batting consultant for his native South Africa for 50 days a year from his Cape Town home. It is a lifestyle he wanted after becoming disillusioned with the daily treadmill of life on the road and, with England now convinced they must have one job in the role across all forms, Downton would clearly have some serious persuading to do to land Kirsten. As it is good performances on the one-day tour of West Indies and the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh could seal the job for Giles while a former England coach in Moores waits patiently in the wings. England also hope to fill the vacancy on their selection panel next week with John Emburey a leading candidate. Another Middlesex man in Angus Fraser would be hotly fancied should England decide that, as with Giles, there is no conflict of interest in being attached to a county and be a selector.","Peter Moores a leading candidate to replace Andy Flower .

Free man: Andrew Woodhouse, 44, was today on trial accused of assaulting two raiders he found stealing diesel from his business - and cleared in 20 minutes . A landscape gardener who attacked two thieves he caught trying to steal from his business was cleared of grievous bodily harm in just 20 minutes today. Andrew Woodhouse, 44, was accused of using excessive force when he broke the arms and legs of one and rugby tackled the other, Cardiff Crown Court heard. But today the jury decided he had every right to defend his property from criminals Kevin Green and Timothy Cross, who ended up with £75 fines. The father-of-five had faced a possible life jail sentence - but was found not guilty of two grievous bodily harm charges for the citizen's arrest of two raiders. After being cleared at Cardiff Crown Court, a relieved Mr Woodhouse said: 'The verdicts show we have a criminal justice that works. 'When people act to defend themselves and their property it will not be considered unlawful. 'The last 10 months have been very harrowing for me, my family and the people I employ.' Mr Woodhouse has been battling a spate of crime at his company - and sprang into action when his alarm rang after midnight as two thieves were stealing diesel. Mr Woodhouse grabbed a fence post one was carrying as a weapon - and used it to fight back against them. He left one with two broken legs and grappled with the other until police arrived. But he was shocked to be charged with using excessive force in his citizen's arrest - and hauled to court four times before being cleared by a 12-strong jury of the public. Woodhouse chased Kevin Green (left) and left him with two broken legs and a broken arm, the court heard. He then allegedly rugby-tackled Timothy Cross (right) and lay on top of him until police arrived . Mr Woodhouse was today celebrating his acquittal after a jury heard the case against him and ruled he was no criminal. He . also runs a machinery and tyre depot two miles from his home near . Abergavenny, South Wales, which have been plagued by criminals. 'If it hadn’t been for him these men . would not have been caught. Where are we in society when a person cannot . act in self-defence to protect his property. That is what Mr Woodhouse . was doing' - Defence lawyer Andrew Taylor . 'I have striven to to build businesses to provide a living for me asnd my family and to provide employment to others,' he said. 'On . the evening in question I went to bed hoping to enjoy a good night's . sleep. But I was disturbed by a call indicating intruders had entered my . business premises. 'I . acted to retrieve property stolen from my business and to detain the two . people and in the course of the struggle it was unfortunate one of them . got injured. 'It was never my intention to to injure anyone that night. 'But . it might serve as a reminder to other burglars and thieves that there . are sometimes unintended consequences to entering property in the dead . of night. 'When in the past I . have suffered thefts and burglaries I have called the police. On this . occasion I did not have the chance to call them. 'I am pleased I managed to apprehend the thieves asnd pleased they were brought to justice. 'Over . the last 10 months I have been fortified by the enormous support from . family, friends and others who were aware of my case. 'Their support helped me no end and allowed me to gather the strength to stay strong and focus on defending myself. 'I would like to extend my thanks to all those who have assisted me in very difficult circumstances.' Rebuttal: Mr Woodhouse denied grievous bodily harm and grievous bodily harm with intent . Mr . Woodhouse said he has repeatedly been a victim of crime at his . gardening company costing him £30,000 over the past five years. He proclaimed he was fully justified in keeping hold of the two burglars until police arrived. The . thieves ended up with £75 fines - but businessman Woodhouse could have . faced a sentence of life imprisonment if he had been found guilty. Green and Cross (pictured) were charged with theft and later given £75 fines by magistrates . Defence lawyer Andrew Taylor told the jury said: 'These thieves thought they would have nice easy pickings that night. 'Many people would have given up and just claimed on their insurance but Mr Woodhouse is made of sterner stuff. 'He showed stoicism, courage and fitness to chase them. 'One of the men was armed and went to attack him. He acted in lawful self-defence. 'He agrees the red mist came down which you can understand when his business has almost been wiped out by crime. 'If . it hadn't been for him these men would not have been caught. Where are . we in society when a person cannot act in self-defence to protect his . property. That is what Mr Woodhouse was doing.' Kevin Green, 53, and Timothy Cross, 32, tried to escape into a neighbouring field with jerry cans full of stolen fuel. But . Woodhouse chased Green - and caught him near their getaway car. He then . attacked Green leaving him with two broken legs and a broken arm. The court heard he then chased Cross before rugby-tackling him. He lay on top of the raider until police arrived. Prosecutor James Wilson described it an 'unreasonable and unlawful assault.' He said: 'It was not reasonable self-defence. Mr Woodhouse lost his temper and went over the top. 'He is a hard-working businessman but he has let his frustration get the better of him. He lost it.' Mr Woodhouse said he was 'gutted and sickened' to learn the extent of Green's injuries. Woodhouse . was woken in the middle of the night by a text message telling him a . burglar alarm had gone off at the tyre yard where he runs his business. Mr Woodhouse was in bed with his wife Lisa at their detached home in the village ofGovilon, near Abergavenny, when his burglar alarm went off at about 12.30am. The alarm is fitted to his business premises on an industrial estate a mile from his six-bedroom £350,000 home. Mr Woodhouse drove to the premises where he disturbed two men stealing stealing diesel from his machinery. The court heard officers found Green lying injured under a blanket - and Cross claiming the businessmen had gone 'over the top'. Mr Woodhouse employs six staff including two of his sons at the family business, which was set up 20 years ago. The court heard how he didn't feel like officers had given him enough assistance when he had been the victim of crime. Green and Cross were charged with theft and later given £75 fines by magistrates. Mr Woodhouse had denied grievous bodily harm and grievous bodily harm with intent. A Facebook page set up in his support saw 4000 peoploe give him their backing. Mr Woodhouse's eldest son, marine Josh, 24, said afterwards: 'This prosecution should never have been brought. 'My father was doing what every right-minded person would do- protecting his family and his property. 'The stress it's caused him and the whole family has been unbelievable.' A Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson said later: 'Andrew Woodhouse was charged with grievous bodily harm with intent after careful consideration of all the available evidence. 'Our decision to charge Mr Woodhouse was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, which requires us to be satisfied that that there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and that it is in the public interest to bring charges. 'In light of the evidence, including the injuries suffered by one of the intruders, it was the prosecution case that Mr Woodhouse's actions during the incident went beyond what the law allows for in terms of self-defence. 'We therefore decided that it was appropriate to bring the matter to court so that a jury could determine the issue. 'Ultimately, all evidence relating to criminal cases is tested during the trial process, with the jury being the final arbiters of guilt or innocence. 'We respect the jury's decision on this matter.'","Andrew Woodhouse was on trial facing assault charges on two raiders .

They happen regularly at every club but when you’re struggling, you can guarantee snippets of a bust-up will get out. I lost count of the number I saw over the years. Some of them lingered, and grudges have started as a result and the players concerned never get over it. Most of them were forgotten in an instant and accepted as part of the game. You shake hands, move on. Doesn't look good: Swansea City dispensed with manager Michael Laudrup on Tuesday after a poor run . Change of tune: Nobody had a problem with Laudrup's relaxed training methods when Swansea were winning . Usually they blow up from a bad challenge in a game but the game is less physical now and consequently there are fewer heavy tackles flying in during training sessions as the game now has an emphasis on interceptions. Little flare-ups and arguments, even when team-mates are playing on the same side, happen all the time at all levels of the game. I have played in a few media games now and seen some classic head throws. In that lovely stadium in Gdynia, I lost it myself with RTE’s Tony O’Donoghue when he failed to pass. Again. So it’s amusing, even now I’m in the media, that training ground bust-ups always seem to fascinate the press, and the public of course. Let's be friends: New interim manager Garry Monk makes up with Chico Flores after a previous disagreement . Happier times: Monk and Flores celebrate winning the Capital One Cup under Laudrup in 2013 . Before he was brutally axed by Swansea City this week, Michael Laudrup had to deal with a training ground bust-up between Chico Flores and Garry Monk, who has now interestingly been appointed interim manager. I wish him all the best. Laudrup made the point that nothing came out of Manchester United on their way to the title last season, but as they’ve had their struggles in David Moyes’ first season, stories have come out of the training ground. Invariably, these scrapes are nothing but when they become an issue the manager has to be seen to deal with it. Otherwise the suggestion is that he has lost control of the training ground. Fired up: West Ham convincingly beat Swansea in Laudrup's last match in charge of the South Walians . It has been a tougher second season for Swansea and there were rumours that Laudrup was going to leave at the end of the season. Perhaps that influenced the board’s decision with their team now just two points above the relegation zone and struggling to hurt teams and score goals. They want to appoint a long-term successor now and halt the alarming slide. But the way the club have got rid of Laudrup has really surprised me. His relaxed style of management, not being on the training ground every day, was not a problem when Swansea were winning. I doubt he has managed the club any differently from day one. But it is scrutinised and criticised when you’re not winning. Split: Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins (left) was the man responsible for telling Laudrup his was sacked . The supporters’ trust has a 20 per cent stake in the club and a say in how it is run. So they do consult with chairman Huw Jenkins, who was the one to inform Laudrup he was sacked. But in doing so they have totally severed the ties with a manager who guided Swansea to a Capital One Cup win less than a year ago and took them back into Europe. He was being linked with the Real Madrid job in the summer. Last season I saw Swansea quite a few times and for the first six months they were brilliant and good to watch. Under Brendan Rodgers there was a lot of possession and passing football but they posed more of a threat under Laudrup, especially with the addition of Michu, who was arguably the signing of last season. He was certainly the best value for money. Missed: Swansea have struggled without the regular goal supply of injured striker Michu (centre) It has not helped Swansea that Michu has been missing for so much of this season and quite often, when he has played, he has not been fully fit. Michu scored 22 goals in all competitions after his move from Spain but this season he has scored just four and played in 15 games. He has been a big miss and his return couldn’t have come at a better time. They have had to rely on another new signing in Wilfried Bony for their goals and he has scored seven in the Barclays Premier League, most when Swansea have been out of games. He has only scored one when they’ve won, and that was a penalty. On target: Wilfried Bony has performed well in Michu's absence, but Swansea have still laboured . Strikers will tell you that goals are goals, and they all count. I was no Alan Shearer, but I prefer to see them scoring when they really matter, particularly when a team is struggling. The dressing room door slammed shut. I had my eyes to the floor. I knew what was coming. And I knew I was getting it. It may have only been a reserves game we’d just lost but it was Derby County v Nottingham Forest. It was still a derby. And Nigel Clough did not want to lose it. But he did lose it with me, and rightly so. Fiery temper: Then Derby boss Nigel Clough criticised me heavily in front of team-mates when I played for the Rams . It was a close game, heading for a score draw and we were injury-time. I was playing at centre-back, brought a ball down near the edge of our area, and flicked it across to my central defensive partner. I didn’t hit it hard enough, a nippy teenage striker sneaked in and scored the winner. He opened the tirade with a few choices in rapid succession. ‘You’re the most experienced player out there,’ he shouted. ‘You still just boot it in the stands.’ And so it went on for a good few minutes. Every word, every insult was justified. Around me were young lads just starting out. I was old enough to be a couple of their dads but that didn’t bother Nigel. It was no different to a rollicking I’d have got 20 years ago. Play the right way: Clough would always encourage his midfielders to enjoy the game and to pass it around . No doubt like his father, Nigel can be hard and he can cut players down with one comment. I liked his management style, the way he worked and the things he said to me. He wants his team to play in what I would deem the right manner, and to go out and express themselves. Whenever I played in his four man midfield, he always told us to go out and enjoy ourselves and don’t hold back. He got that into the players every day and would stop a session if a player was holding back and not doing things naturally. Fulham were awful on Tuesday, there’s no getting away from that. But Sheffield United thoroughly deserved their victory, their second at a Premier League ground after beating Aston Villa in the third round. Of course the priority is wins in their League One relegation battle. David Weir was sacked after 10 games because Sheffield United were in the bottom four. Like Coventry City and Wolves in this division, Sheffield United and the supporters believe they should be in the Championship, at least.Thumbs-up . Jose Mourinho . Villain to hero in a week. His tactical masterclass at the Etihad has thrown the title race wide open. And was nearly as good as Big Sam’s at Stamford Bridge. All right, it was one of the best we’ve seen. But did we really expect anything else? Masterclass: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho reminded everyone of his tactical genius against Man City . Thumbs-down . Aberdeen ‘supporters’ It is disgusting that Neil Lennon cannot go to a football match in peace.

New rules on what can pass for jam and marmalade will spell the ‘end of the British breakfast as we know it’, the government has been warned. Cutting the amount of sugar which must be used to call something jam will leave people eating the ‘coloured mud’ favoured by the French, Germans and Americans, Lib Dem MP Tessa Munt claims. The aide to Business Secretary Vince Cable warns new regulations will mean jam is less tasty, dull in colour and will not last as long. History: Traditional, sweet English jam could become a thing of the past with people forced to buy French-style 'fruit butter', the government has been warned . Ministers argue that cutting the minimum sugar level of jam from 60 per cent to 50 per cent will make it easier and more lucrative for British producers to export their goods. The change will initially only affect England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to follow suit. But Ms Munt, MP for Wells in Somerset, used a debate in Parliament today to call on the government to think again. Warning: Lib Dem MP Tessa Munt dismissed low sugar jams as 'coloured mud' She warns that customers will not know . what they are buying, and instead of ‘glossy’ traditional jams will . instead be forced to buy ‘fruit butter’. ‘I'm actually quite worried because I think this is going to be the end of the British breakfast as we know it,’ she told the BBC. Ms Munt went on: ‘Our jams and marmalades are so important - and we know what to expect when we go into the supermarket or into our local shop or farm shops locally, we know exactly what we're going to buy when something says jam on it - or marmalade or jelly - we know exactly what to expect. ‘At the minute, we've got a jam that we know exactly what it's like. It's a fantastic colour, a really good shelf life, it's going to last a year. ‘It's beautiful consistency… it's got a gloss to it. ‘If these regulations change, we'll end up with something much more like the French and German product - and worse still the Americans - where they have things a bit like a fruit butter or a fruit spread. ‘It's dull colours that don't taste the same and they certainly don't last as long.’ Fears: Critics of the government's plans say that in future jam on sale in England will not be as brightly coloured . The idea that a fruit preserve must be 60 per cent sugar dates back to the 1920s. Supporters argue it is necessary to ensure the sugar acts as a preservative, giving them a longer shelf life. By reducing the minimum sugar levels, the jam will have to be boiled for longer to ensure it sets, and as a result the fruits will lose their colour and taste. However, some producers argue it will make little difference because ‘reduced sugar jam’ already sold in this country must contain less than 50 per cent sugar. Paul Gorman, from small producer Clippy's, said: 'Tessa Munt’s arguments are absolute nonsense. 'Jam already legally exists with sugar levels of 50 per cent or less.  Legally, this has to be called ‘reduced sugar jam’.  The issue is that there is a jams no-mans land between 51-59 per cent where there is basically no law.' The government claims that many manufacturers want the changes to be made. During the debate in Westminster Hall, Ms Munt said: 'We all know what we expect when we go to the supermarket - something that is of beautiful quality, beautiful colour and it has a shelf life of about a year. 'By reducing the percentage of total sugar, the characteristic gel-like consistency of jams and marmalade will be lost. The result will be an homogenised spreadable sludge that does not bear any resemblance to what we know in England and what we enjoy as British jam. 'With a 60% sugar content, the colours of sweet preserves are bright and characteristic of the fruit used to make the product. The fruit is fantastic. 'A lower percentage produces products with darker, muddier colours which may affect consumer confidence in the British product. 'In addition, if the consistency lacks the characteristic gel and is instead more like a fruit spread or a fruit butter, consumer confidence in the properties of jam and similar products may be lost.' Environment minister George Eustice said the Government intended to support the proposal because manufacturers would still be able to make jam with 60 per cent sugar. Speaking in the debate, Mr Eustice said: 'The reduction in the minimum sugar levels to 50 per cent delivers the greatest flexibility to the industry as a whole in a way that I do not think will be detrimental to those who are in compliance with the regulations.' The regulations drawn up by the UK government have been approved by the EU and are now making their way through a series of committees. Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said the Government should consider introducing a kite mark for all jams with 60 per cent sugar content. And Tory MP Priti Patel said the Government should be helping British producers to export their jam around the world. In a jam: Make the most of  strawberries - try our recipe for the perfect jam .

Pregnant: Julia Navarro, 58, right, hugs her daughter Lorena McKinnon after acting as surrogate for the 32-year-old . Utah resident Julia Navarro, 58, is looking forward to being a grandmother for the first time, but doubly so because she will be the one in the delivery room actually giving birth to the baby girl. After three years and about a dozen failed pregnancies, Ms Navarro's 32-year-old daughter Lorena McKinnon and her husband Micah were getting desperate to start a family. They tried in-vitro fertilization but that failed too. When they reached out to a friend to be a surrogate, the woman dropped out after learning how complicated the process would be. Seeing that her daughter had hit a wall, Ms Navarro stepped up and volunteered to be the couple's surrogate. 'As a family, we have to help each other,' Ms Navarro told the Salt Lake Tribune. But being past her prime pregnancy years meant she had a lot of work to do to get her body ready for baby. For three months leading up to the incubation, Ms Navarro had to take hormone shots every day - leaving her bruised and bleeding. Under Utah's 2005 Parentage Act, the couple and surrogate also had to go through three months of counseling and sign a series of official contracts. 'The psychologists wanted to make sure we knew what we were getting into — that we were mentally prepared,' Mrs McKinnon said. 'Mostly, surrogacy contracts are with people you don’t know. It was weird to have a contract with my mom.' Touching: Lorena McKinnon, right, feels  her mother's bump. The 32-year-old has had a dozen failed pregnancies and now her mother is acting as surrogate . Close bond: The mother and daughter are about eight months into the pregnancy . Mrs McKinnon estimates that surrogacy usually costs $60,000 and that she and her husband have been able to save $30,000 with her mother volunteering to carry the child. The rest they've paid for by taking out loans, including some money borrowed from mom. The money and painful preparation was worth it in the end however, when the first embryo suprisingly took. Doctors had estimated that there was a 45 per cent chance of Ms Navarro getting pregnant with her age. Other than that the pregnancy has been easy, especially since the young couple moved into Ms Navarro's small house to help her out. She hasn't had any morning sickness or discomfort and up until recently was able to work three 12-hour shifts at the hospital in her job as a nurse's aide. A mother's gift: Young couple Micah and Lorena McKinnon (pictured) have been trying to have children for the past three years, but struggled to get pregnant. Finally, Lorena's mother stepped up to volunteer as surrogate . Nesting: Mr and Mrs McKinnon moved in with mother Julia Navarro when she was successfully incubated to help the 58-year-old through the pregnancy . In fact, her daughter seems to be worrying about the pregnancy more than her, constantly reminding her that she needs to drink more water, stay away from peas and not cross her legs because it will hurt her circulation. Ms Navarro has to remind her daughter that she's gone through two successful pregnancies and knows 'how to do it, thank you very much'. The family is now anxiously awaiting the baby's birth, which is due in a few weeks. They plan to name the girl Myla Juliette McKinnon. Ms Navarro has been so moved by the experience that she hopes to do even more good with the baby's birth. 'I was praying, ""If this baby works, I am going to help others,""' she said. 'I would like to donate some of the money from my baby shower [January 12] to children in Peru who don’t have parents or moms or dads who need help.' Mr and Mrs McKinnon also hope to continue growing their family, since they have five embryos left, but plan to find another surrogate next time. Expecting: The couple are expecting a baby girl in the next few weeks. They hope to have more children, but plan to use another surrogate next time .","Lorena McKinnon and her husband Micah struggled through three years of failed pregnancies .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:56 EST, 16 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:04 EST, 16 January 2014 . State wildlife officials are trying to figure out why all the fish have died in a northern Nevada marina where the stocked fishery has flourished since the man-made lake was created nearly 15 years ago. An estimated 100,000 trout, bass and catfish have died over the past month in the Sparks Marina along U.S. Interstate 80 east of Reno, apparently the result of a dramatic, unexplained drop in dissolved oxygen levels, Nevada Department of Wildlife spokesman Chris Healy said Wednesday. Scientists say a bitter cold snap could have caused oxygen-poor waters to rise from the old rock quarry's bottom to the surface, but they don't understand what sparked the massive die-off. All of the fish died in the lake at Sparks Marina in Nevada - 100,000 in a single month . Fish biologists confirmed low oxygen levels caused the death of an estimated 3,000 fish in one corner of the lake in mid-December, but Healy said they thought at the time that the event was localized and of limited impact. Since then, they've been unable to detect any live fish in the 77-acre lake. Numerous dead fish have been removed from the lake's shoreline, and Healy said it's likely the rest sank to the bottom. 'The 100,000 dead fish figure is something that is probably a pretty conservative guess,' said Healy, who estimates they've stocked close to 1 million adult fish in the lake since they started in 1998. 'We don't know if any small fish have survived, but for all intents and purposes, the fishery doesn't exist anymore,' he told The Associated Press. The Reno Gazette-Journal first reported scientists determined the problem was much more serious than they realized after a boat survey on Monday found dissolved oxygen levels far too low to support the fish at 11 different sampling locations. Readings from an electronic fish-finder also revealed no fish swimming in the lake's depths. Scientists are baffled by the die-off and have been unable to find the underlying environmental cause . Lakes like the marina consist of different layers of water temperatures, with the warmest water on top holding the highest oxygen content, Healy said. He said one theory is that the surface water may have chilled very quickly, sank toward the bottom of the lake and stirred up material on its floor, causing a 'violent turnover' that could have sucked up additional oxygen. 'Everything is a theory right now,' Healy said. Sparks city spokesman Adam Mayberry emphasized there's no health or safety threat at the marina. He said the water typically is of good quality and no similar problems have occurred before. 'Even with the biological anomaly we are seeing, it's still a very safe body of water,' he said. 'You just can't fish in the marina right now because there aren't any fish there, and we are trying to figure out why.' The Sparks Marina opened in 2000, with a 2-mile walking and bike trail, beaches, playgrounds, picnic areas and a fishing pier. The former aggregate pit operated by Helms Construction Co. had been found to be contaminated in 1988 by pollutants leaking from an adjacent tank farm, but state environmental officials said all the pollution had been cleaned up before a 1997 New Year's Day flood sent Truckee River waters into the pit. Michael Drinkwater, manager of the Truckee Meadows Wastewater Reclamation Facility which collects water from the lake, is awaiting results of new toxicity tests conducted last week but said routine testing has revealed no problems before. He told the Gazette-Journal there's no obvious indication hydrocarbon pollution could be associated with the die-off. Healy said testing earlier this week found dissolved oxygen levels in the range of 1.1 to 1.9 parts per million. Fish do best with levels in the range of 7 to 9 parts per million and typically can't survive when it drops below 5 parts per million, he said. The department annually stocks the marina in late February or early March 1, but he said they won't be doing that this year unless the dissolved oxygen level 'makes a big recovery.'","Fish at Sparks Marina near Reno, Nevada, died from lack of oxygen .

"By . Quentin Letts . PUBLISHED: . 18:29 EST, 19 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:29 EST, 19 December 2013 . Drama: Christine Keeler, played by Charlotte Spencer, with Stephen Ward (Alexander Hanson) Time to can that cliche about Andrew Lloyd Webber being middle-class twee. His slick new musical has F-words, drug-dealing and a silver-service orgy involving a bare-buttocked aristocrat in a gimp mask and a pinny. Who does he think he is? Channel 4? Some scenes in Stephen Ward have a projected image of a big chandelier thrown high on central drapes. It is a surprise some trouserless Sybarite is not swinging from it with his floozy, even while singing one of those classic Lloyd Webber reprises a semi-tone higher than its predecessor. Ward (played by Alexander Hanson) was the Mayfair osteopath who in 1960 introduced War Minister John Profumo (Daniel Flynn) to sexpot Christine Keeler (Charlotte Spencer). His circle also included a vodka-swilling Soviet diplomat, Eugene Ivanov (Ian Conningham). Did the minister betray secrets? No, sings Christine. In his ‘lust, warheads were not much discussed’. But Fleet Street’s finest went into orbit. Profumo was finished, the Tory Government fell and the unfortunate Peter Pan (or deluded pimp?) Ward killed himself. Most dramatic art demands the suspension of disbelief. This fiery polemic argues, all too convincingly, that Ward was a ‘human sacrifice’ in a ‘political revenge trial’. A political revenge trial? Biased judges and warped lawyers? In Britain? It could never happen now! Moving on sharply before we  prejudice any current trials, this grown-up, richly produced, strongly scored musical has a timeless  topicality. Bent coppers, lying  parliamentarians, a bed-hopping elite and grubby newspapermen. We haven’t changed much in  half a century. One drawback is that the Profumo story is over-tilled soil. Another is that this sex-for-larks episode was so lacking in innocent romantic love. The exception was the steadfastness of Profumo’s wife Valerie. Her forgiveness of her husband gives the show its best tingle moment, Mrs Profumo (Joanna Riding) singing ‘I’m Hopeless When It Comes To You’. That moving song and a zippy number called ‘1963’ – a ‘Hey There Georgy Girl’ soundalike sung with perhaps too much aggression by Christine and her friend Mandy Rice-Davies (Charlotte Blackedge) – sound the best bets for posterity. The central melody, much repeated, begins with an octave leap and has a meandering descent. It, too, worms its way into your head. The mocking march ‘You’ve Never Had It So Good’ (echo: ‘You’ve never had it so often’) is also catchy, even if the joke was pinched from an early issue of ‘Private Eye’. Praise: This is a powerful musical not about revolution but about defeat and decay and it is well worth seeing . The show starts with hypnotic woodwind as Ward’s ghost steps out of the Madame Tussauds Chamber of Horrors (Blackpool branch). His waxwork image has been placed here alongside acid murderers and Adolf Hitler. ‘I never expect this,’ he admits. Soon we are in the haunts  familiar to anyone who knows the Profumo/Keeler story: Murray’s night club, where Christine was a dancer. And the Wimpole Mews house where Ward and Keeler set up (platonic) home. Christine and Profumo meet by the pool of Lord Astor’s stately home, Cliveden. We do not see the water but its ripples are cleverly reflected from behind a wall. Miss Spencer and Mr Conningham strip, he doing some pleasing comedy while hiding his crown jewels. Director Sir Richard Eyre has drilled his troops well. There is a completeness to this show. You sense you are in the hands of master craftsmen. Did composer Lloyd Webber have to rummage around in an increasingly empty tune box? That would be a harsh judgement. This is, however, the work of an artist in his later phase, both shadowed staging and the music being brushed by a sceptical world-weariness rather than the vaulting, full-lit optimism of innocence. This is a powerful musical not about revolution but about defeat and decay and it is well worth seeing.","Slick new musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber 'well-worth seeing'

The last portrait that Henry VIII posed for is thought to have been identified in a stately home where it has been hanging for more than 300 years. The oil painting, which was created on an oak panel, has been hanging in a stately home in Wiltshire for more than 300 years with little clue as to its origins. However, the value of the portrait jumped from a mere £10,000 to more than £1 million after experts examining tree rings in the panel discovered they could be dated to before the king died in 1547. The painting is on a wooden panel, which has now been scientifically dated to within Henry VIII's lifetime, possibly making it the last painting he ever posed for . Ian Tyers carrying out a painstaking tree-ring dating study of the oak panels the discover the age of the portrait . The painting was previously thought to . be a portrait of the king painted after his death. Now, after thorough scientific examination of the oak, experts believe Henry VIII may have posed for an unknown artist in 1544, three years before his death. The wood is believed to date back to 1529. The painting has an inscription on it stating that it was painted when the Monarch was aged 54, in the 36th year of his reign, but it was common for information to be placed on later copies. But a closer look at the inscription showed it had been added at the same time the portrait was created. It will now be moved to a glass case in a different area of Longleat House in Wiltshire where it had been display to visitors for much of the year. The procedure to date the wood involves incredibly precise measurements and can reveal the date that a tree was felled . The thick wooden panel had to be closely examined with microscopes and other expert devices to determine its age, without damaging it . Part of the scientific study that helped to date the portrait to within the King's lifetime . Dr Kate Harris, the collections curator at Longleat, said: 'We recently had to revise our collections for our insurance and . the valuers alerted us to the implications if the Henry VIII portrait . was an earlier piece than thought. 'The . feeling has always been that our portrait was painted after his . lifetime and was a very good copy. It was common to have the year of his . age on later copies. 'An expert came in and he carefully took the painting out of the frame and studied three of the four oak panels. 'He . counted the distance in the gap between the annual growth rings to a . 100th of a millimetre and found the three boards were all from the same . oak tree in the eastern Baltic, probably Poland. “The tree was felled . sometime in or shortly after 1529. It wouldn’t have been transported to . England immediately. It would have been left lying around for a period. The king was known for his six marriages, all of which ended in some sort of tragedy, divorce, or death, but Henry VIII was also known for other, stranger things: . 'The . study represents a date after which the portrait was painted but it . does allow for the key conclusion that it remains possible that the work . is of the same date in the inscription. Elizabeth Norton, an author and . historian of the Tudor monarchy, said: 'He died in January 1547 and . suffered from ill-health for much of 1546. There aren’t any paintings of . him depicted as as old man. 'It may well be the last painting that he posed for.' The work was previously owned by Henry VIII's brother-in-law Sir William Herbert, husband of Ann Parr, who was the sister of his sixth and last wife Catherine. After Henry’s death in 1547, Sir William was made the Earl of Pembroke at Wilton in Wiltshire. Archives show an incumbent at Longleat House purchased the painting from the Earl in 1680 where it has remained in obscurity until now. Lawrence Hendra, a leading art dealer and  specialist on Antiques Roadshow said only 10 portraits of Henry VIII were painted in his lifetime. He said: 'Portraits of him from life are very rare. The majority of Henry VIII’s iconography was produced posthumously and in considerable quantity for dynastic reasons. 'If it can be proven for definite that Henry VIII sat for the Longleat portrait then it would be very significant. 'A late 16th century copy could be worth anything between 1,000 pounds to 50,000 pounds whereas a work painted from life would be more than one million pounds depending on quality and condition.'

Lisa Leake and Vani Hari, both from North Carolina, noticed that the brightly-colored pasta contains two synthetic substances - yellow 5 and yellow 6 - that add nothing to the flavor and may be dangerous to children's health. They also discovered that the Illinois-based food giant makes the same product for consumers in UK but because of stricter regulations regarding additives, it is dye-free. Scroll down for video . Finishing touch: The dyes - yellow 5 and yellow 6 - are used in the U.S. version of Macaroni & Cheese for aesthetic purposes and now thousands are campaigning for them to be removed . Mrs Leake,35, and Ms Hari, 33, have launched a Change.org petition titled Kraft: Stop Using Dangerous Food Dyes in Our Mac & Cheese which currently has 41,482 signatures. In a video posted on the site they say that the yellow dyes, which contain benzidine 4-amino-buphenyl, a man-made product derived from petroleum, are used 'solely for aesthetics'. The go on to highlight that the colorants have been linked to hyperactivity in children, asthma, migraines and cancer. Mrs Leake, whose children are aged five and eight, said: 'We think this is an important issue to tackle because Kraft Macaroni & Cheese is an iconic food product. 'Everyone’s had it at one time or another. I used to eat it... I used to feed it to my kids years ago and we think we deserve the same version that our friends overseas in the UK get without artificial food dye.' Spreading the word: Lisa Leake and Vani Hari, from North Carolina, have launched a campaign asking Kraft to remove the artificial food dyes in its U.S. version of Mac & Cheese . Ms Hari points out that the dyes require warning labels in other countries outside of the U.S. and have been in some European countries. In the UK Kraft does not use the additives in its version of Macaroni & Cheese, called Cheesy Pasta. Instead natural beta carotene and paprika are added to achieve a yellow color. In their home-made video the two women taste-test both the U.S. and UK version of Kraft's Macaroni & Cheese. They conclude that the two taste 'virtually the same' and 'barely' look different.

A gay couple who claim to have suffered homophobic and anti-English abuse in a remote Highland community say they are leaving the village after being taken to court accused of assaulting one of their 'tormentors'. Paul Maden, 45, and James Findlay, 40, moved to Scotland ten years ago to become chocolatiers. They set up their luxury chocolate company, Cocoa Mountain, in the remote crofting village of Durness, Sutherland – attracting fans ranging from US senators to Yoko Ono and Prince Charles. But the couple told Dornoch Sheriff Court this week that their lifestyle had offended locals John Morrison and son Malcolm Morrison, who subjected them to a decade-long campaign of abuse. Paul Maden and James Findlay, pictured, claim to have suffered homophobic and anti-English abuse in a remote Highland community . The stand-off culminated in an assault charge which alleged that the two gay men had flagged down ferryman John Morrison’s van and had then repeatedly punched him on the head through an open window. Mr Maden said he was acting in self-defence only and a sheriff found the case not proven. But the gay couple now say they have been driven out of Durness and will leave as soon as the economic situation improves. Mr Findlay told the court that he had found the homophobic abuse he claimed he faced from the  Morrisons ‘really upsetting’. He said: ‘We constantly live in fear. We’re looking to get away as quickly as possible but at the moment it’s difficult because of the financial climate.’ The partners live together in  Durness at Balnakeil Craft Village – a former Cold War camp turned into a community for creative people. 'Offended': Malcolm Morrison, left, and John Morrison, right, from Durness leaving court on Tuesday . They claim that Mr Morrison and his son have carried out a campaign of intimidation against them since their arrival. But both denied assaulting him outside Cocoa Mountain on April 14 last year. Mr Morrison, 63, told the court on Tuesday that he had been driving past the business with his son Malcolm, 35, when the couple  signalled for him to stop. He said: ‘I wound down the  window and they just started punching me.’ But Marc Dixon, defending Mr Findlay, suggested to Mr Morrison: ‘This is part of a campaign against these men that’s gone on since they moved in because you don’t like them and you don’t like their lifestyle.’ Mr Morrison denied this and  Malcolm Morrison, a warden at Cape Wrath bombing range, claimed that Mr Maden and Mr Findlay had attacked his father for no reason. They set up their luxury chocolate company, Cocoa Mountain, in the remote crofting village of Durness, Sutherland, pictured . The couple's luxury chocolate company's website, Cocoa Mountain. The company has attracted fans ranging from US senators to Yoko Ono and Prince Charles . The partners live together in Durness at Balnakeil Craft Village, a former Cold War camp on Scotland's north coast . Mr Dickson said: ‘For whatever reason, you have chosen to dislike them and make their lives miserable.’ Malcolm Morrison replied: ‘Yes, because they make everybody’s life miserable.’ Mr Maden told the court that he heard racist and abusive shouting when Mr Morrison’s van pulled up, before the ferryman grabbed him by the collar and pulled his head and shoulders inside the vehicle. Mr Maden said he was hit on the back of his head and shoulders and lashed out to protect himself. Sheriff Jamie Gilchrist found the case not proven but Mr Maden and Mr Findlay still intend to leave  Durness, despite global success with Cocoa Mountain, which uses milk from Highland cows in its exotic chocolates, some of which are allegedly ‘natural aphrodisiacs’. Prince Charles once asked the chocolatiers to blend his Barrogill whisky into a truffle, but they turned him down because they did not want to use preservatives. On the decision to leave, Mr Findlay said: ‘I feel Durness is quite a tolerant village. It’s just the Morrisons that have taken a dislike to us.’","Paul Maden, 45 and James Findlay, 40, said their lifestyle had offended locals .

Doctors believe Joanne Slater may have died as a result of having a gastric band fitted in 2005 . A mother who had gastric-bypass surgery to have the baby she longed for has died from a rare infection believed to have been caused by the operation. Joanne Slater, 38, from Stannington, Sheffield, had the operation to control a hormone imbalance which doctors thought caused her to gain weight and was preventing her from becoming pregnant. The insurance worker had suffered three miscarriages, in 1995, 1998 and 2000, and tried dieting unsuccessfully before going under the knife in 2005 as a last resort when she reached 23st. At first the results were impressive and Mrs Slater lost half her body weight before giving birth to Lily-Mai, who is now aged four. However, she later developed serious nutritional deficiencies as well as a rare and deadly listeria infection discovered in her blood when she was admitted to intensive care at the Northern General Hospital. The mother went into cardiac arrest brought on by pneumonia and suffered devastating brain damage which led to the decision to switch off her life-support machine earlier this month. Michael Slater, Joanne’s husband, said her death was ‘such a shock’ and highlighted the potential risk involved with bariatric surgery. The cancer nurse, aged 47, said: 'When Joanne had her operation, it was still relatively new and doctors are now finding more patients developing problems further down the line. 'It’s difficult - if she’d never had the operation we’d never have had Lily-Mai.' A photograph taken of Joanne Slater in Goa in 2003 before her gastric by-pass operation . Joanne had the operation to control a hormone imbalance which doctors thought caused her to gain weight . Mrs Slater pictured in 2003 had the gastric by-pass to lose weight so she would be able to give birth . Mrs Slater, a former pupil of . Sheffield’s City School, met her husband when they worked together at a . care home in Endcliffe, Sheffield. The couple tried for a baby for . years. Mr Slater said: 'We’d almost given up hope. You name the diet, Joanne had tried it. She had hormone problems and was given the opportunity to have an operation.' A gastric by-pass makes the stomach smaller, meaning patients feel full more quickly and reduces the amount of calories absorbed by the bowel. Close: Joanne Slater pictured with her husband Michael and the daughter she longed for Lily-Mai . Mrs Slater had the procedure on the NHS at Thornbury Hospital, Sheffield, in 2005. Her husband said: 'She did very well initially, it couldn’t have gone better. She was bright and bubbly, the life and soul of the party.' Devastated: Michael Slater holds a photograph of his wife Joanne who died earlier this month . As Mrs Slater slimmed down the couple took up active pastimes such as dancing and walking, and went on exotic holidays, including a trip to Africa in 2006 the same year they were married. Lily-Mai was born three months premature in 2009. Mr Slater said: 'Joanne was so proud. She was fantastic, everything you would want in a mum. 'But unfortunately her health got worse.' Mrs Slater's weight loss became too extreme and she complained of muscle pains and tiredness. Doctors prescribed supplements for a lack of nutrients such as copper and vitamin D, thought to be a side effect of the surgery, but her health continued to decline and she developed a rare and deadly listeria infection in her blood. Mr Slater said: 'The listeria really wiped her out. I asked the consultants if they had any idea how it got there and they said no. It’s a rare infection, they could only say it was probably related to the surgery.' She spent Christmas in hospital and went into cardiac arrest on New Year’s Eve. Doctors managed to revive her but her brain was severely damaged due to a lack of oxygen. Happier times: Michael and Joanne Slater pictured on their wedding day in 2006 .

Her funeral was held on Wednesday at Christ Church Stannington followed by a burial at Crookes Cemetery. Donations were collected for baby charity Tommy’s and future fundraising events have been planned. Mr Slater said: 'I just wish that she had managed to lose that weight some other way - I wish it more than anything in the world. Joanne Slater was admitted to the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield where she died earlier this month . 'But unfortunately that wasn't the case. She tried absolutely everything - diets, exercise - everything. 'When Joanne had Lily-Mai we expected it would be the start of a long and happy family life together. 'I don't want to pin any blame on the operation because they did their best and we did manage to conceive as a direct result of the operation. 'But my daughter doesn't have a mummy because of the operation that gave her life. 'I have mixed emotions about the operation. I just wish she could have found another way to lose the weight. 'For anybody considering this surgery, my advice would be not to take the decision lightly.' Michael Slater holding a photo of his wife Joanne who had gastric-bypass surgery so she could give birth . A gastric-bypass is when the digestive system is re-routed past most of the stomach so you digest less food and it takes much less food to make you feel full. People with a gastric-bypass will lose around two-thirds of their excess body weight. Procedures help the patient feel satisfied on smaller quantities of food and helps reducing hunger in between meals. Some operations affect hormonal changes, which cause changes in women’s appetite. Surgery can now be offered to anyone with a BMI over 40, where lifestyle and medication have been ineffective. It also significantly reduces the health risks of women who have severe and complicated obesity. Women are advised not to become pregnant within 18 months of having had weight-loss surgery. It is also true that, despite the advice to avoid pregnancy within a year of surgery, many women do become pregnant and go on to have a successful pregnancy. But during this time, nutritional deficiencies can occur. However, it is usual for all patients to be prescribed multivitamin and mineral supplements, and sometimes at higher doses. After weight-loss surgery most of the weight loss takes place in the first 12-18 months. It is best to avoid pregnancy in this period, as the effects of weight loss on the baby are still not fully understood. For women who had surgery more than two years previously, weight is likely to have stabilised. Women who are obese are less likely to conceive naturally and when receiving treatment for infertility require higher doses of gonadotrophins and more days of ovarian stimulation to achieve the desired pregnancy rates. Obesity also impacts negatively on pregnancy and is associated with increased risk of gestationaldiabetes, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, the need for induced labour and caesarean delivery.","Joanne Slater had the operation to control a hormone imbalance .

Thousands of motorcyclists roared into the nation’s capital for the Two Million Bikers rally - as the nation observed moments of silence to honor the victims of the 9/11 terror attacks - intent on drowning out an event originally titled the Million Muslim March. The Million Muslim March changed its name to the Million American March Against Fear (MAMF), but that did not change the bikers’ minds. Scroll down for video . Flags hang from bikes as motorcyclists gather to mark the 12th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks . Denied a police escort, the group took more than an hour to move through Washington DC . Starting from a Harley Davidson store, groups of 50 motorcycles made their way into the capital . Starting from a Harley Davidson store just outside the city at 11am, groups of 50 motorcycles made their way into the capital, according to the Washington Times. Denied the necessary permits to have a police escort through traffic and stopping for traffic lights, the massive assembly took just over an hour to move out. Aerial footage showed bikers choking traffic on both highways and local roads. The bikes rolled through the city for 50 minutes for heading to the Beltway. Riders told the Washington Times they believed the denial was for political reasons. ‘We’re here for 9-11,’ national ride coordinator Belinda Bee told the paper. ‘We are going to have a peaceful ride... but there are people who are sick and tired of their rights and liberties being taken away.’ With no definitive route, the groups spun around the city, flying their flags and calling out tributes . The event was designed to drown out another titled the Million Muslim March. Although this was later changed to Million American March Against Fear (MAMF), the bikers were undeterred . Their patriotic duty: Bikers ride on Constitution Avenue on the National Mall as they participate in the 2 Million Bikers to DC rally, many called it their patriotic duty . The thousands of participants roared through the city in their own tribute as the nation held minutes of silence . Authorities denied the accusations, noting that permits are not needed to rally in the capital. ‘This is a God event,’ a commenter said on the motorcycle rally’s Facebook page. ‘I believe America has been in a 12-year funeral. But I’m a Christian man and not a Muslim. I believe in the resurrection! God bless America!’ The commenter added. MAMF, the rally opposed by the bikers, began on the National Mall just after 12pm – right as the bikers began to circle the area. With many streets surrounding the rally closed off to traffic, the bikers were not able to get to the rally of their disdain. ‘A historic event for solidarity of humanity to establish peace, harmony and justice,’ is how MAMF’s Facebook page described their rally, organized by the American Muslim Political Action Committee (AMPAC). President Barack Obama honoured the 3,000 people who died 12 years ago in a speech outside the Pentagon . This was one of many tributes after Al Qaeda's attacks on the Twin Towers and Pentagon in 2001 . The rally, which started outside of the city, took over some of the main entrance points to Washington DC . The riders did make their presence felt though, with clusters of motorcycles circling the surrounding blocks like hawks as MAMF’s speakers and organizers tried to rally. Explaining that American-Muslims ‘stand with America against terrorism,’ speaker Ruby Sous said ‘we want to stand here in solidarity with the American people against hate and violence,’ according to the Times. Christian protestors who showed up to protest against the Muslim rally – in addition to the motorcycled masses – shouted back ‘you picked the wrong day!’ Not quite one million: demonstrators march across the National Mall  during what was planned to be the 'Million American March Against Fear: Peace, Harmony and Justice . Throughout all this, motorcycles could be heard circling, coursing and revving their way around the rally. Another speaker, Princeton University professor Cornel West preached social justice and peace, while condemning violence, said the Times. Attendees tried to hold a moment of . silence, but all they heard were revving motorcycles, MAMF chief . organizer Isa Hodge told the Times. No more social injustice!: Cornel West speaks during a rally originally called the Million Muslim March . Peace, unity: Mr West speaks during the rally, he condemned violence during his time on stage . Though not quite as large as the name would suggest, there were several thousand motorcyclists in attendance, stretching at least one-third of a mile long as they rumbled down suburban highways, according to reports. MAMF also did not exactly live up to its name, with only a few dozen supporters showing up, according to the Times. Several speakers also railed against conspiracy theories, American soldiers in the Middle East and other ‘fringe topics,’ according to the Times. They were outnumbered by the throngs of park police and counter-demonstrators on hand, according to reports. You picked the wrong day!: Despite preaching peace and unity, and saying they were against terrorism, the Muslims were shouted down by Christian counter-protestors . A number of motorcyclists were involved in an accident on the ride into the capital, but no severe injuries were reported. The bikers’ Facebook page thank everyone for coming, wished everyone a safe ride home and said they’ll see each other next year. MAMF’s website was down when MailOnline tried to access it, and its Facebook page offered no indication the rally would happen again. The phone number listed on AMPAC’s website went directly to a Sprint voice mailbox that was full.","The Two Million Bikers rally suited up to protest the Millions of Americans March Against Fear (MAMF), formerly called the Million Muslim March .

Detectives, who believe at least 10 people were involved in the incident, this morning arrested a suspect during an early morning raid in north London. Victim:  A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of Hani Abou El Kheir, left and right,  who was believed to have been attacked by a gang wielding swords and knives .

The teenage victim, who lived on the nearby Churchill Gardens estate, was taken to King's College Hospital following the attack but died later. Detectives said they were keeping an 'open mind' regarding a motive and were being assisted by a number of witnesses who have already come forward.

A 16-year-old Texas girl who survived a fall of more than 3,000 feet in a skydiving accident last weekend will be discharged from an Oklahoma City hospital on Friday, a hospital spokesman said. Makenzie Wethington was flown to the OU Medical Center on Saturday after the accident at a skydiving school in Chickasha. She will be transferred to a Dallas-area rehabilitation facility, OU Medical Center spokesman Scott Coppenbarger said. Wethington's parents agreed to allow her to skydive as a 16th birthday present, and her father jumped ahead of her. When the teen, from Joshua, Texas, jumped, her canopy opened but with a malfunction that she was unable to correct, and she did not deploy a reserve parachute as she had been taught to do. Scroll down for video . Incredible: Miraculously, the Joshua, Texas, teen, pictured, survived the horror fall, baffling doctors at the OU Medical Center where she has now been moved out of intensive care . Emotional: Joe Wethington, pictured, has described the moment he watched his 16-year-old daughter plunge 3,500ft to the ground after a skydiving accident Saturday . Her father, Joe Wethington, has said she told him she blacked out as she plummeted to the ground. She landed on grass. The impact of Wethington's dramatic fall damaged her liver and broke her pelvis, lumbar spine in her lower back, a shoulder blade, several ribs and a tooth. Doctors said it would be weeks before she could bear any weight, but described the speed of her recovery as remarkable. She has not yet had any surgery to correct her myriad injuries. 'Our trauma physician who saw her expected her not to make it when he first saw her,' Coppenbarger said. 'The family thinks this is a miracle. It's remarkable that this happened on a Saturday and she's getting discharged today.' Joe Wethington has said the skydiving company erred in allowing someone so young to jump, even though he signed the company's waiver. The company's owner said the teenager was taught how to correct the malfunction she experienced during a six-hour training session that she attended with her father before they made their skydives. Joe Wethington described the moment he found out his daughter had fallen earlier this week. 'The . whole way over there, from the time that I knew (the skydiver was) going to hit the ground... it was ""please God, don't be Makenzie, please . please please God, don't be Makenzie."" And it was.' She is now talking . and has feeling back in her extremities. Miracle: Doctors in Oklahoma are baffled at how 16-year-old Makenzie Wethington, pictured, survived plunging 3,500ft to the ground after her parachute didn't open properly Saturday . Alive: Makenzie Wethington, 16, fell approximately 3,500 feet to the ground when her parachute apparently malfunctioned . Confusion: Joe Wethington, pictured here with his daughter, expected Makenzie to jump tandem with an instructor but he said the company made her go solo . 'I . wasn't there, but if she truly fell 3,500ft I have no idea how she . survived,' Jeffrey Bender, the OU Medical Center trauma surgeon who . treated Makenzie, said in the news conference. 'When I saw her in the emergency . department, I would have predicted she was not going to survive all of . this. But I'm always happy to be wrong about these things.' Within . 12 hours of arriving at OU medical, Makenzie's internal bleeding had . stabilized and she began regaining consciousness, Bender said. She is . expected to be fully recovered after six to eight weeks of . rehabilitation. Makenzie's . parents have slammed the skydiving company, Pegasus Air . Sports, for failing to properly train their daughter ahead of the jump, . and claim they offered her only a solo jump rather than tandem with an . instructor. 'She . wasn't prepared,' Joe Wethington said. 'We weren't walked through the . steps for the malfunction that did take place, at all.' He added in the news conference: 'I . don't think she should have been allowed to go up there and I find it . very hard to believe the rules and regulations in Oklahoma are that lax. I think it is the company...' Wethington drove to Pegasus Air . Sports in Chickasaw, Oklahoma for the jump after Makenzie said it was . her dream to go skydiving on her 16th birthday. In Texas, the legal age to sky-dive is 18 but Oklahoma allows 16-year-olds to jump with parental permission. Wethington, who was also in the . airplane, successfully jumped before watching from the ground as his . daughter tumbled through the air and landed with a thud. 'She was screaming real bad and . acting like she had the wind knocked out of her, wheezing,' the . emotional father recalled. 'Then . she started screaming, ""Get off me, get off me,"" and nobody was on her. Then she told me to rub her back and she'd start screaming real loud.' Emergency crews arrived in 15 minutes and began administering aid. Shocked: 'I wasn't there, but if she truly fell 3,500ft I have no idea how she survived,' Jeffrey Bender, the OU Medical Center trauma surgeon who treated Makenzie, said in a news conference Tuesday . Pegasus . owner Bob Swainson said Makenzie and her father went through about . six hours of training before they jumped, which is standard for new . jumpers at Pegasus. But Wethington said it was closer to two or three hours. According to its website, the registered company requires four hours of training for first-time static line jumpers. During training, Swainson said jumpers are taught how to respond in emergency situations and deploy backup chutes. As Makenzie was falling, a radio operator on the ground instructed her to deploy her backup chute, but she didn't do it. Her . parents, who are considering a lawsuit, said she wasn't trained . properly to respond to the emergency situation mid-air and she wasn't . strong enough to deploy the second parachute. They also suspect her equipment may have been faulty. According . to Swainson, who was in the plane with the father and daughter, Makenzie's chute opened . fully but took a left turn after opening and spiraled to the ground. Not so sweet: Makenzie was with her dad Joe, who took her to Oklahoma to skydive for her 16th birthday . Excited: In most places and in Texas where the Wethingtons live, you must be 18-years-old to skydive. To get around the rule, the father and daughter drove to Oklahoma, where 16-year-old Makenzie could jump with her father's consent . 'All . I'm going to say is it had a bit of a turn, and it wasn't corrected,' the 46-year skydiving veteran said. 'It probably could have been . corrected.' Meanwhile, her father described his daughter as the 'toughest kid I ever met.' 'She never shed one tear,' he told reporters. Makenzie's mother, Holly Wethington, said she was talked into signing the permission slip because she thought her daughter would be jumping tandem. 'They talked me into it because of course they said it was safe, she'd be on somebody's back, it wasn't going to be her responsiblity to do anything, so I did give her permission because she was very excited,' she recalled through tears. 'God's hand caught her,' Makenzie's older sister Meagan told KDFW earlier this week. Things looked grim after the jump but the teen exuded joy and excitement beforehand. Makenzie and her father were there to fulfill her dream to go skydiving. 'You can be 16 with a parent consent. My dad is jumping with me,' Makenzie tweeted leading up to her perilous fall. 'She's still alive and really she shouldn't be': Makenzie's sister Meagan (right with Makenzie at left) says her sister's survival is nothing short of a miracle . It was one of many ecstatic dispatches she'd send out Friday. Makenzie's . dad jumped first and Makenzie followed thereafter. Another man decided . he didn't want to do it and the instructor stayed behind. Joe . Wethington landed safely on the ground and watched helplessly as his . daughter spiraled down, her parachute apparently jammed. 'My dad said that the guy on the ground was talking to [my sister] through the radio,' Meagan told NBCDFW.com. 'They had a radio in their ears. And my dad just heard him keep saying, . ""Reach up. Pull the chute out. Reach up. Pull the chute out. You need . to calm down, calm down.""' The family believes Makenzie must . have panicked and it kept her from fixing her chute or engaging the . backup. She was rushed to an Oklahoma City hospital. 'Her . vertebrae broke in half,' Meagan said. 'Her pelvic bone completely . split in half. She has more broken bones in her back. She has two broken . ribs…her teeth.' Survivor: According to Meagan, Makenzie has several broken vertebrae, a shattered pelvis, smashed teeth and serious internal bleeding. She was on a breathing machine, but miraculously she was breathing on her own after two days . Makenzie also had serious internal . injuries including bleeding in her brain, lungs and liver according to a . Facebook account the family set up to keep loved ones updated on . Makenzie's well-being. She was on a breathing machine at first. But miraculously, after two days, she improved enough to start breathing on her own. Meagan says her sister is able to wiggle her toes and can even speak a little. 'She honestly keeps saying is, she just thinks it was her fault, because she couldn't reach up and pull the shoot,' said Meagan. Whose fault it was remains unclear. Makenzie jumped with her father's consent, but more often than not a jumper's first skydive is done tandem - that is, while strapped to the back of a more seasoned jumper. This is what her father expected to happen, however, Pegasus Air Sports Center only offered solo jumps. Makenzie is now focused on her recovery. 'The whole thing that's keeping us going is because she's still alive and really she shouldn't be,' Meagan said.","Makenzie Wethington, 16, went skydiving for her birthday but her parachute malfunctioned and she could not deploy her emergency chute .

Music, it seems, really is the food of love… at least for David Cameron and wife Samantha. The Prime Minister has revealed the song which soundtracked the couple’s early courtship, and how an eclectic love of music has sustained 18 years of marriage. Mr Cameron named Perfect Circle, an album track with obscure lyrics by American alternative rock group R.E.M., as the song which they listened to as they fell in love. Favourite: Perfect Circle, an obscure album track by US band R.E.M. provided the soundtrack to David and Samantha Cameron's early courtship . The Prime Minister, pictured with wife Samantha at the Conservative Party Black & White Ball last night, lifted the lid on the couple's early musical tastes . The Tory leader does not have a good track record with making his musical choices public. In 2010 The Smiths’ Jonny Marr banned him from listening to their music, after he repeatedly named them as one of his favourite bands. And Radiohead frontman Tom Yorke vowed to ‘sue the living s***’ of the Conservative if he used one of the band’s songs in an election campaign. But so far at least there has been no warning from R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe about the song he listened to while wooing his future wife.

Asked during an interview on BBC Manchester radio to name the song that meant most to the couple when they were falling in love, Mr Cameron named Perfect Circle from R.E.M’s 1983 debut album Murmur. He told presenter Mike Sweeney: ‘We . had lots of songs. There was one by R.E.M, I think, which was Perfect . Circle, which we liked a lot. ‘In . June this year, we’ll have been married 18 years.

While . the PM has happy memories of listening to the same song over and over . again, his repetitive music choices have not always curried favour with . Mrs Cameron.

A newly-released 911 tape from the Florida movie theater shooting reveals that the alleged shooter sat and watched the victim die from a gunshot wound to the chest. A frantic call was made from the movie theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida at 1.29pm on January 13 after a shot rang out. A caller is heard on the tape telling the dispatcher 'there’s been a gunshot... it looks like it broke his sternum' with a 'shotgun or pistol'. He also frantically alerts the dispatcher to the fact that the shooter, 'an older gentleman', is still present. Scroll down for audio tape of the harrowing call . Suspected Florida movie theater shooter Curtis Reeves was led away in handcuffs wearing a white jumpsuit after police removed his clothing for evidence. A 911 call released today revealed he had watched as his alleged victim died from a gunshot wound . The dispatcher, from the Pasco County Sheriff's Office, asks: 'Do you know who shot him?' The caller said: 'I don’t know…it looks like an older gentleman in the movie theater.' 'Is he still in there?', says the sheriff's office responder. 'Yes, he is,' comes the callers whispered response. Meanwhile married father-of-one Chad Oulson, 43, was lying on the floor of the movie theater with a gunshot wound to the chest. The 911 caller, who explains that he is a trained nurse, says: 'Looks like there’s blood going through his lungs, so we need someone here fast.' A woman then takes the phone asking: 'Where are they? The pulse is really slow…I can’t feel it anymore.' The dispatcher tries to calm the callers, telling them that help is on the way. At 10 minutes, 11 seconds after the call is placed, police arrive - but it is too late to save Mr Oulson. Devastated: The killing of Chad Oulson, center, has left 22-month-old Lexy, right, without a father and Nicole Oulson a widow . Florida Police Captain Curtis Reeves, Jr., suspected of fatally shooting Chad Oulson, 43, and wounding his wife, Nicole, 33, appears in court wearing a suicide-prevention gown . Curtis Reeves, 71, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of the married father. He is being held without bail at Land O' Lakes jail in Florida. Chad Oulson's widow Nicole . struggled to contain her emotions as she spoke on Thursday about the . day that her husband was shot dead. The couple had gone on a rare date to watch the movie Lone Survivor, leaving their 22-month-old daughter, Lexy, with a babysitter. As Mr Ouslon checked his phone for . any word on his daughter during the previews, another cinema-goer, . retired police officer and father-of-two Curtis Reeves who was sitting behind the couple with his wife, asked him to put it away. An . argument ensued - with some witnesses saying Mr Oulson threw popcorn - . and Reeves shot the father once in the chest. Mrs Oulson was shot . in her hand as she tried to protect her husband. She said that she wants his 'senseless' killer locked up for life. 'He brought an unfair life sentence to me to have to raise our daughter alone,' Nicole Oulson, 33, told Good Morning America in her first live interview. 'To . have to live without the love of my life, for my daughter to have to . grow up without her daddy by her side for graduation and marriage. 'It was so unnecessary. It was for no reason, so I want him behind bars and to be punished for his senseless act.'

There . were a couple of words, no threats, no harm, no nothing.' Her attorney, TJ Grimaldi, joined her . on Good Morning America and said that Reeves might try to use the . controversial 'stand your ground' law for his defense. 'There's just no way that this can stand up in this case,' he said. 'In my opinion it doesn't matter if it was . popcorn, Twizzlers, a hot cup of coffee - there is absolutely no reason . that it should have to escalate like this.' Torn apart: She said the killer left her without the love of her life, Chad, center, and Lexy without a daddy . Now Mrs Oulson said she is just trying to be there for her young daughter. 'She's luckily at a young age... she doesn't know what's going on,' she said. But she knows there are things her husband did she will never be able to replace, such as putting Lexy to bed. 'The . last thing he would say before tucking her in was, ""You make me so happy,"" and she would say, ""Me happy . too, Daddy"". And those are the times I'll never be able to replace, and that's when it's hard.' Mr Oulson's colleagues at Sky Power Sports have set up a Facebook page to raise money for Nicole and Lexy.

A British scientist has spotted a strange object that he has named ‘Peggy’ in one of Saturn’s rings. Astronomers are baffled by what the ring might be, but one theory suggests it could be the beginnings of a new moon. In a talk at American Geophysical Union this week, Professor Carl Murray of Queen Mary University of London said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft. The thin, outermost ring shown in this picture from the Cassini probe is Saturn's F ring, and the bright dot near it is the moon Prometheus. The thicker white band is the A ring. The smudge near what looks like the tip of that ring was created by Peggy . The mysterious object, which was located at the right edge of Saturn’s A ring, has been named ‘Peggy’ after Professor Murray’s mother-in-law, according to a report by Adam Mann in Wired. Peggy is thought to be about a 0.6 miles (1km) in diameter, which experts claim is too small for it to be a moon. It could, however, be the build-up of ring material that has collapsed gravitationally under its own weight. Saturn is known to have of 53 natural with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings . Launched in 1997, Cassini has been exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004. On Saturn, a full year is the equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning Cassini has only been able to observe a third of a Saturn year. Since 2004, Saturn and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer. Cassini has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving there in 2004, also observing Jupiter, the heliosphere, and testing the theory of relativity . Cassini is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter orbit, and its mission is on going as of 2013. Some of Saturn’s moons, particularly those orbiting near the rings, are thought to have formed in this way, creating a ring of dust then collecting more material to grow. The planet is known to have of 53 natural with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings. Some moons, such as Prometheus and Pandora, interact with ring material, shepherding the ring in its orbit. After his initial discovery, Professor Murray took a look 107 Cassini images taken since 2012 and claims it's possible to see a smudge made by the object in many of them. The Cassini team is particularly interested to see what happens to Peggy next month, when gravitational interactions will cause the A ring to expand. Last year, hundreds of objects up to half a mile in diameter were caught on camera wreaking havoc with one of Saturn’s rings. Last year, hundreds of objects up to half a mile in diameter were caught on camera wreaking havoc with one of Saturn's rings. From left to right in the top row, the trails in these images are 18, 85 and 96 miles long. In the bottom row from left to right, the trails are 43, 129 and 32 miles long . The objects were actually snowballs created by some of Saturn’s 60 moons, like Prometheus. They were snapped punching through Saturn’s F ring, the outermost of the planet's main rings, with a radius of about 87,000 miles. At the time of the discovery, Professor Murray said, ‘I think the F ring is Saturn's weirdest ring, and these latest Cassini results go to show how the F ring is even more dynamic than we ever thought.’ Launched in 1997, Cassini has been exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004. On Saturn, a full year is the equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning Cassini has only been able to observe a third of a Saturn year.","Professor Carl Murray named the object Peggy after his mother-in-law .
It is thought to be kilometre in diameter - too small to be a moon .
Experts, however, believe it could be the beginnings of a new moon .
If this is the case, it is being formed due to the build-up of ring material that has collapsed under its own weight ."

David Cameron’s authority was dented yesterday after he was forced to rely on Labour and Liberal Democrat votes to face down a mass rebellion by his backbenchers over immigration. The Prime Minister appeared unable to control his party as 86 Tory MPs voted to stop foreign prisoners using the right to a family life in the Human Rights Act to stay in Britain. On a day of farce in Westminster, Downing Street and the Home Office rejected an amendment tabled by Tory backbencher Dominic Raab as illegal and unworkable but then announced they would abstain on the vote rather than annoy the rebels. David Cameron's authority was dented yesterday after he was forced to rely on Labour and Liberal Democrat votes to face down a mass rebellion by his backbenchers over immigration . In a fresh coalition split, Liberal Democrat ministers broke ranks with their Conservative colleagues and voted to defeat the amendment on the grounds that it breaches the European Convention on Human Rights. But the rebels were only defeated when Labour leader Ed Miliband ordered his MPs to oppose the plans as well. The Raab amendment was finally thrown out by 241 votes to 97, with 86 Tories rebelling. Privately, some MPs compared Mr Cameron’s position to that of John Major, who was described as being ‘in office but not in power’ during the latter days of his premiership. One said: ‘There is the appearance of chaos... at best.’ The battle came as the Coalition’s Immigration Bill was passed into law, limiting migrants’ access to the NHS and council housing. Tory MP Dominic Raab wanted the Home Secretary - rather than the courts - have the final say on whether an offender's family links are strong enough to allow them to avoid deportation . Home Secretary Theresa May won a battle to toughen up the Bill, passing a Government amendment to give ministers the power to strip people suspected of terrorist activities of their British passports – even if that leaves them stateless. During the debate, Mr Raab said foreign criminals were using their right to a family life as the ‘joker’ to escape deportation. The MP for Esher and Walton said many victims of crime were being put at risk because their attacker remained in the UK. Mrs May argued that the Raab amendment ‘is incompatible with the European Convention on  Human Rights’ and even suggested it would make it harder to deport criminals. But then, to widespread derision, word leaked out that Tory ministers would not oppose the amendment. Home Secretary Theresa May won a battle to toughen up the Bill, passing a Government amendment to give ministers the power to strip people suspected of terrorist activities of their British passports - even if that leaves them stateless . No 10 sources acknowledged that the situation was ‘messy’ but said that by abstaining on the key vote they had avoided an ‘unnecessary confrontation’ with the backbenchers like the one which tore the party apart over prisoner voting last year. They stressed that Mr Cameron ‘supports the principle’ of Mr Raab’s plan to curb the abuse of Article 8 of the Human Rights Act by foreign criminals but could not vote for an amendment that would be illegal.But the Prime Minister’s refusal to take on his own party was seen in Westminster as an admission that he was unable to impose his authority. Another MP added: ‘We’ve avoided an omnishambles and settled for a basic shambles instead.’ Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said it was a ‘car crash’ for Mr Cameron and Mrs May. She said the backbenchers ‘scared her away from making the right decision’. Former Tory leader Lord Howard warned that repeated rebellions could cost the Conservatives a majority at the next election. He added: ‘What is needed is a  degree of self-discipline from  Conservative backbenchers.’","Tory MP Dominic Raab tabled amendment on kicking out foreign criminals .

The derogatory account, @HISDHoustonHoes, targets female students at schools in the Houston Independent Schools District and refers to women as 'hoes' and 's***s', features disturbing pictures of used sanitary napkins and posts call-outs for explicit images. As the humiliated teenager recovers in hospital, her mother has called on authorities to hunt down the cyber bullies and shut down the account. 'I don’t want them to get away with it. Throw the book at them. They need to stop,' the mother said. Abhorrent: This anonymous Twitter account, which uses the official HISD logo, has posted explicit photos of underage girls and has more than 230 followers . It appears the girl's picture has since been removed. She had originally sent the rude image to her boyfriend, according to KHOU 11 News. The girl's devastated mother said her daughter attempted suicide because she felt powerless against the online bullies. 'Her half-naked, her showing her upper . body.

'Other parents need to see what kids are doing. We all need to see or at least try and stop it. It is wrong.' In a disturbing development, many members of the public have blamed the young girl for her situation, saying she should never have sent the selfie in the first place.

Twenty-four blue telephone boxes resembling Doctor Who's Tardis have turned up in the city centre. But don't panic. Multiple incarnations of the Time Lord haven't arrived to protect West Yorkshire from an alien invasion. The phone boxes are actually an eye-catching way of bringing free wi-fi access to internet users. Twenty-four blue telephone boxes resembling the Doctor's Tardis have turned up around Leeds city centre - but they are actually solar-powered wi-fi hubs . The traditional red phone boxes have been painted blue to look just like the Doctor's famous time machine. (Above, David Tennant and Billie Piper next to the real Tardis) The internet hub scheme has been branded 'sci-fi wi-fi' - and the traditional red phone boxes have been painted blue to look just like the Doctor's famous time machine. The booths have been installed by telecommunications company aql to store network equipment under what it is calling the Leodis project (Leeds Electronic Ordnance and Digital Information System) - appropriate, given that Leodis was the Victorian name of the city. The boxes are locked and all services are accessed from the outside using touch panels behind glass - allowing the public to make phone calls and gain wi-fi access. Each 'Tardis' will house a high bandwidth network and is solar powered, avoiding the need to dig up the streets to install electricity and the network.

This information will be archived and shared online to contribute to a digital history of the city. CEO and founder of aql, Dr Adam Beaumont, said: 'We wanted to create an icon for Leeds - something unique which if you had your photo taken next to it and uploaded it, for example, to Facebook, friends would say - ""aha! you must be in Leeds!"" 'We're hoping that the boxes become something that the residents accept as part of the cityscape.' The blue painted boxes are 'recycled' classic K6 phone boxes from the 1930s - originally designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, who was also the designer of Battersea Power station, Waterloo Bridge and Liverpool Cathedral - and will allow free wi-fi access to anyone nearby. Lurene Joseph, chief executive of Leeds . and Partners, said: 'These boxes are a great illustration of Leeds’ digital ability and confidence and will be another excellent part of the . city’s infrastructure.

Battle: MP Tim Yeo is fighting to save his political career following the Commons sleaze inquiry . The plot to sack veteran Tory MP Tim Yeo gathered pace last night after 12 members of his constituency party executive issued a public call for him to quit politics. They challenged Mr Yeo’s claim he was ‘exonerated’ in a Commons sleaze inquiry. They also accused him of neglecting his constituency. The new attack is led by South Suffolk Conservative Association members Nick Antill, the treasurer, and businessman Simon Barrett. They have written to Conservative MPs who support Mr Yeo. Mr Yeo was deselected by the local association executive in a secret ballot in November. But he has asked for a ballot of local party members, which if they back him would trump the executive. ‘There is a common feeling he has not spent enough time in his constituency,’ say the local activists. The ‘Yeo must go’ letter criticises his speech to an executive meeting of the association where he was asked about claims he abused his position as chairman of the Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee to help environmental companies lobby Ministers. Mr Yeo said he was ‘totally exonerated’ by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, who said he had not broken any rules. But the letter says the Commissioner warned that the affair had ‘affected his reputation’ and he ‘should consider more carefully his comments in future’. Ballot papers to 600 members of South Suffolk Conservatives are being sent out this weekend. Mr Yeo’s fate will be announced on February 3. Mr Yeo last night stood by his claim that he was ‘exonerated’ by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner.

He has accused Mr Yeo of 'not spending enough time' in his constituency . Busy: Mr Yeo, who has claimed he is 'totally exonerated', is pictured on the 2010 Election trail in Suffolk . Asked about other criticisms by activists, he said: ‘I look forward to the result of the ballot.’ Mr Yeo said he was ‘extremely surprised’ at the claims made by the 12 executive rebels. ‘The letter’s contents contradict repeat allegations now exposed as completely false and are not relevant to the executive’s decision about my reselection,’ he said.","Tory MP Tim Yeo accused of 'not spending enough time' in constituency .

But Smith's fellow inmates at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee, Florida, know how much she would love to be there, telling him how proud she is, hugging him before he hits the field.

Smith will pin up a picture of Demaryius and the Broncos in the prison's humble TV room, paint her face in Denver colors and cheer with homemade pom-poms she and her mom crafted from newspaper. Demaryius was just 11 when he begged his grandmother to stop selling drugs in their home. Shortly after he told his mother he had dreamed someone was going to jail for a long time, the women were busted.

Regrets: Smith said not being there when Demaryius, pictured at a January 19 game, was drafted to the NFL and missing his games has been one of the things she regrets the most . 'He was under the impression that I . sold the drugs,' Smith told The Post. 'I did — and I told him and his . sisters — I did keep money from my mother on two occasions and that's . how I got pulled into the whole thing.' Smith was offered a maximum sentence of eight years if she testified against her mother. But she refused. A full decade went by before she could tell her son the truth about what happened. 'I . told him over the telephone,' Smith said. 'I wasn't able to tell him in . person. But before I was able to tell him in person, his face was like . he didn't want to be there ""Why do I have to come? I don't even like . coming down here.""' He only visited the prison for the first time in 2003, then again in 2006 and 2009. She said she needed to apologize so she and her children could move forward with repairing their relationship. '... it was heavy on my heart. I could talk to him over the phone, and it was like he respected me and he loved me, I knew that, but at the same time, it was something missing. Like the conversations might of been short, or the visits, he was kind of isolated. So I was like, maybe I need to go ahead and tell him and his sisters what really happened so they can make their own decision how they want to deal with it.' Dealing: The football player's grandmother, Minnie Thomas, pictured right, faced 40 years to life, and Smith 20 years for possessing with intent to deal cocaine . And she was glad she did. Demaryius immediately responded 'I forgive you.' 'It really made me happy, and our relationship grew from that point on,' she told The Post. She . said she apologized again in 2012, and wanted to make it clear that she . didn't choose her mother over him and his sisters, which she said was . what a lot of people thought. 'I . just wanted him to know that I was sorry, and I was sorry for all the . bad choices that I made that led me to be away from him,' she added. Smith said not being there when Demaryius was drafted to the NFL and missing his games has been one of the things she regrets the most. But she cheered him every step of the way during the AFC Championship Game. 'I was nervous, I was shaking, I was sweating, and waving our pom-poms, and I was holding my breath and I was like ""Oh my goodness, this is really happening, this is really happening,""' Smith recalled. And she will be even more full of emotion come kickoff Sunday. Prison: Smith and her mother will cheer for Demaryius from the humble TV room of the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee, Florida, pictured . 'One of the things is I wish I could be at the stadium, watching the game in person with my 88 jersey, with my pom-poms, and getting the crowd pumped and hyped, to cheer for them,' she said. 'And then being able to see him once they come off the field, and he being able to see my face to know that I'm there to support him and his team.' Demaryius knows his mother is proud of him. 'My momma, she just told me, ""I told you you would make it,""' he told The Post. 'We haven't really talked about it much, but I talked to my grandma and she said the same thing. She got emotional and all, but they just said, ""You were going to make it.""' He added that he's driven to play his best because 'they're going to talk about it... in the jailhouse.' If the football player makes it to the 2017 Super Bowl, Smith might just get her wish to watch her son in person, as she is scheduled to be released on Christmas Day 2016 - Demaryius' 29th birthday.

Adrian Street, 72, originally from Brynmawr, Wales, says he removed parts of the former Top Of The Tops presenter's scalp and left him covered in bruises during a fight between the pair. The wrestler said had he known Savile was a sex offender when the pair met in 1971, he would have given him a 'bigger hiding.' Savile took part in over a hundred matches as a semi-pro wrestler. Fight: Former wrestler Adrian Street, pictured, has claimed he pulled out clumps of Savile's hair and left him covered in bruises during a match . Street, who now runs a wrestling shop in Florida, told WalesOnline that promoters were trying to put Savile across as a tough guy and were attempting to get him to fight with professional wrestlers. The man, known for his flamboyant costumes when he was competing, said: 'It was all part of some big stupid gimmick. 'But . I was having none of it. I kicked his legs from underneath him, then I . picked him up by his hair, held him upside down and dropped him on his . skull. 'Then when I looked down at my hands, I realised they were covered in hair – Savile’s. I’d torn huge clumps out of his scalp.' The wrestler added that when they met in 1971, Savile would frequently talk about how young girls would wait for him outside his dressing room. He added: 'All the fighters on the circuit used to boast about their conquests. But Savile used to go on and on about the young girls who’d wait in line for him outside his dressing room. 'He’d pick the ones he wanted and say to the rest: ""Unlucky, come back again tomorrow night."" 'Had I known then what I know about him now, I’d have given him an even bigger hiding.' Boasts: According to the wrestler, Savile bragged about how young girls would wait for him outside his dressing room when they met in 1971 . Today, the former director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer said that failing to report allegations of child sexual abuse should be made a criminal offence in Britain. Mr Starmer believes it is time to 'change the law' and said it should be 'mandatory' to report allegations in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Speaking on BBC Panorama, Mr Starmer said: 'I think the time has come to change the law and close a gap that's been there for a very long time. I think there should be a mandatory reporting provision. 'The problem is if you haven't got a central provision requiring people to report, then all you can do is fall back on other provisions that aren't really designed for that purpose and that usually means they run into difficulties.

Worshippers travel hundreds of miles to queue up outside his house in Alipurduar, West Bengal, to seek blessings by touching his tail. Scroll down for video . Monkey business: Chandre Oraon, 35, from West Bengal, has a 14.5inch tail, leading to locals believing that he is an incarnation of Hindu monkey deity Hanuman. Tail as old as time: Chandre Oraon shows his 14.5-inch hairy tail at his house in Jalpaiguri, India . Mr Oraon, who works as a tea picker, said: ‘I am Hanuman. People have a lot of respect for me because of my tail. I don't mind the tail at all. It is a gift by god.’ His followers see his ability to climb trees as proof that he is Hanuman, and believe he has healing powers. Monika Lakda, who had travelled overnight to see Mr Oraon at his small makeshift shrine, said: ‘My brother's son was once very unwell and had fever. ‘We gave him medicine but it did not work.

It occurs when something goes wrong during the first month of an embryo's development meaning the spinal column doesn't close fully. Exactly why this happens is not known but the most significant risk factor that has been identified is a lack of folic acid before pregnancy and in the very early weeks of pregnancy. Symptoms of the condition include learning difficulties, paralysis of the lower limbs and incontinence. Spina bifida occulta is the least serious type of spina bifida and causes just a very small opening in the spine. This opening tends to be covered with skin so the gap is not visible externally, as it can be with other forms of spina bifida. However, this skin often contains a hairy patch or a birth mark. It usually does not cause any symptoms meaning most people are unaware they have the condition. Spina bifida affects about one child in every 2,500. Source: NHS Choices . Mr . Oraon’s tail is a result of the birth defect spina bifida, which . can result in lower-back growths or, as in Mr Oraon’s case, a tuft of . hair, which can grow into a tail if left uncut. Spina . bifida occurs when the spinal column does not close all of the way down . – it is one of the most common permanently disabling birth defects. It is highly likely that Mr Oraon was born with a form of spina bifida called spina bifida occulta. A . spokesperson for Shine, a spina bifida charity, told MailOnline that it . is quite common for children with spina bifida to have a hairy patch on . their back. Mr Oraon's uncle, Baldev Ram, said: ‘With age, his tail has also been growing longer. So, we realised very early that he has the blessings of God.’ Despite having found fame as a revered Godman, Mr Oraon admits it wasn't always easy. He said: ‘When I was young, kids in the village used to make fun of me and my tail. 'They used to laugh. They used to pull my tail just for fun.’ And he revealed that his tail was also a turn-off for the ladies - with his family saying over 20 women rejected his romantic advances before he met wife Maino, 38. He said: ‘A few women rejected my proposals. I had gone to see a girl once. She immediately noticed that I have a tail. 'She refused to marry me there and then. She said to my face it was because of my tail.’ Mr Oraon married Maino, 38, in 2007, before the couple had a daughter, five-year-old Radhika. He is persevering with plans to build his own temple so he can offer mass blessings. He said: ‘I want to build a temple. But I am poor man, so I am looking for some help. I work but then I don't earn much, so I need to find other ways to fund my dream.’","Indian tea picker Chandre Oraon, 35, has grown a 14.5-inch hairy tail .

A judge has again decided to give no jail time to a Texas teenager who was responsible for a drunk driving crash that killed four people. Ethan Couch was given 10 years' probation for the wreck last year that also severely injured two people. But he was back in court Wednesday after prosecutors requested jail time on charges related to the two people who were injured. Judge Jean Boyd issued the original sentence and made Wednesday's ruling. The original sentence stirred fierce debate, as a defense expert said Couch's wealthy parents coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility. The expert termed the condition 'affluenza.'

Father: Fred Couch, father of teenager Ethan Couch, collects his belt after clearing security as he arrives at juvenile court for a hearing about his son's future Wednesday, February 5, 2014, in Fort Worth, Texas . Prosecutors made one last ditch effort to put the 16-year-old behind bars in the intoxication assault cases. 'During his recent trial, the 16-year-old admitted his guilt in four cases of intoxication manslaughter and two cases of intoxication assault,' DA Joe Shannon told Star-Telegram in December, before the latest decision. 'There has been no verdict formally entered in the two intoxication assault cases. Every case deserves a verdict. The district attorney's office is asking the court to incarcerate the teen on the two intoxication assault cases.' The two intoxication assault cases referred to the two teenagers riding in the same car as Couch, Sergio Molina and Soliman Mohmand. Sergio can still only communicate by blinking months after the crash. The maximum allowable sentence for the two counts was three years in a juvenile prison, but despite a guilty plea the judge still decided to issue no punishment. No jail: Ethan Couch of Keller, Texas, pictured here in December, avoided jail for killing four people or injuring two more .

Heartbreaking: Sergio now must be cared for by . his mother Maria Lemus (left) and older brother Alex (right) around the . clock and they have already accrued $1million in medical bills . The two friends were in the back of a pickup truck being driven erratically by . Couch when he slammed into four people on the side of a road. Those four people - a young woman whose car had broken down, a Good Samaritan trying to help, and a mother and daughter who also got out to see what they could do - were all killed. Before: Sergio had dreams of playing professional soccer before the accident . Sergio, who is now 16, is still alive but . has a completely different existence than he did before the accident as . he is paralyzed, 'minimally conscious' and needs constant medical . attention. Speaking to CNN in December, Sergio's older brother Alex Lemus said that doctors warned them of getting their hopes too high. 'That's all we can hope for, is how he is now for the rest of his life,' Lemus said. He attended Couch's 2013 trial in place of his brother, who can barely move without assistance. When . the judge handed down a sentence of 10 years' probation and no jail . time for the crash, Lemus said that he had trouble processing his anger. He said he was 'disappointed, so outrageously angry that I couldn't say anything.' His . mother, Maria Lemus, still breaks down in tears when thinking about all . of Sergio's dreams that seem so far out of reach in light of the . accident. 'He was the best son, he was the kind of boy who had a lot of dreams,' Lemus said. 'He was his first dream was to be a soccer player. He was sweet.' Sergio's . family estimates that they have accrued more than $1million in medical . bills since the crash, and they are now suing Couch's family . and his father's business - the car that the boys were in was owned by . his company - for up to $20million.

Youth pastor Brian Jennings, mother and daughter Hollie and Shelby . Boyles and 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell were all killed on impact. It . was revealed soon after that Couch's blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - . three times the adult limit, though minors aren't allowed any alcohol in . their system - and that he was also on the prescription drug Valium . when he started the chain reaction of crashes. Killed: Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by Couch's out-of-control pickup . Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash . The impact flung the four people 50 to 60 yards, authorities reported.

An energetic Avonte Oqundo, whose distraught parents are suing the Department of Education for negligence, is seen in the footage bounding down the halls of his Long Island City special needs school and out of the double doors that were carelessly left ajar by an unidentified man more than 30 minutes earlier. A security guard then comes to close them just three minutes after the teen slipped away. Scroll down for video . Tragic moment: An energetic Avonte Oqundo, pictured, is seen in the footage bounding down the halls of his Long Island City special needs school and out of the double doors . Apart from a brief sighting on security . video from outside the school, the heart-breaking October 4, 2013 . footage is the last time the teen is seen before he was reported . missing. A massive manhunt failed to find the child, whose remains were . eventually discovered in a nearby section of the East River this month. Investigators are still awaiting test results to determine his cause of death. However, the New York Post quotes police sources as saying they believe he fell into the water by accident and drowned. The latest video shows the man, possibly a teacher, walking down the corridor at 12:08 p.m. and pushing through the double doors as he leaves. He fails to properly shut the doors behind him, leaving them ajar. A little over 30 minutes later, Avonte runs down the same hall as if drawn to the crack of light between the open doors. He pauses at the doors for a fraction of a second and then disappears through them. Just three minutes later, a school security guard notices the doors aren't shut and closes them.Police released the previous video showing Avonte running from the Center Boulevard School once through the doors, during the search for the boy. Life cut short: A massive manhunt failed to find the teen, pictured, whose remains were eventually discovered in a nearby section of the East River this month . 'Never again. Don't let children leave school between bringing them to school and getting them home. They can't disappear,' the family's lawyer, David Perecman, told ABC TV. The family is suing the city, alledging school security was responsible for keeping Avote safe and failed. They also believe a search took too long to begin. However, the NYPD maintains that safety agents did nothing wrong. Earlier this week, U.S. senator Charles Schumer proposed a new law in the name of the disabled teenager, which would fit autistic children with tracking devices. He said 'Avonte's Law' would make it easier for authorities to find children with the disability who had gone missing. Under the proposed legislation, a state-funded voluntary scheme would see children's clothes fitted with a small GPS system. Careless: The latest video shows a man, possibly a teacher, walking down the corridor, left, at 12:08 p.m. and leaving the double doors ajar, right, as he exits . Outside: Police released the previous video, pictured, showing Avonte running from the Center Boulevard School once through the doors, during the search for the boy . Standing with Avonte's mother, Vanessa . Fontaine, and grandmother, Doris McCoy, Sunday, Senator Schumer said the . family was going through a 'nightmare' and that steps needed to be . taken to prevent a similar incident happening again. Avonte, who had a form of autism that made him non-verbal, had been missing since October 4, when he walked out of his school toward a park overlooking the river. His body was found in the river about 11 miles from where he vanished earlier this month. His disappearance sparked a massive citywide search that saw volunteers join forces with police. In a program that would cost around $10 million and be overseen by the Justice Department, schools and parents would be issued with tiny GPS chips. Currently in the US a similar system is used for locating Alzheimer sufferers. Somber closure: Avonte Oquendo's mother Vanessa Fontaine seen through the casket of her son, Avonte, as it is brought out of Saint Joseph's Church in the West Village after a memorial service . River of tears: Weeping family and other attendees of Avonte's funeral lay flowers over his casket at it is prepared to leave for the burial . Outpouring of support: Dozens of the volunteers who handed out flyers with Avonte's picture on them and helped the search effort were on hand at the church Saturday . 'There is no reason the same program . that's been successful with elderly people with Alzheimer's who wander . cannot be used for kids like Avonte who have autism and wander,' Senator . Schumer said in New York, according to the The Wall Street Journal. 'The only barrier is the funding.' Perecman backed the proposal, which he said could save lives. Hundreds . of grieving relatives, friends and sympathetic strangers came together . Saturday for a funeral marking the tragic end of a three-month search . for the missing autistic New York City teen. The former Roman Catholic archbishop . of New York, Cardinal Edward Egan, presided over the ceremony at the . Church of Saint Joseph as Avonte's parents and brothers sat stoically in . a front pew, next to a white casket holding the boy's remains. 'This . morning we are grateful to God for Avonte Oquendo, for his life, for . his courage, and for the acts of goodness and kindness that his life and . his tragic disappearance evoked among us,' Egan said Saturday. Heartbreaking task: An NYPD dive unit searches for Avonte's remains after an arm and legs were discovered along a rocky shoreline in Queens January 17 .

Zinc has long been seen as a supplement to a healthy diet, with claims that it has many positive effects, but now scientists believe that reducing zinc levels could lead to a new therapies for common disease . Cartilage can be destroyed by molecular changes involved in processing zinc, a naturally occurring metallic element, a new Korean study has found. This means that zinc-rich foods, including seafood, cocoa and chicken, could be causing the painful condition osteoarthritis. When the cartilage breaks down in osteoarthritis, the bones rub together, causing pain, swelling, and stiffness. Osteoarthritis affects the joints and is the most common type of . arthritis in the UK, with around 1 million people seeing their GP about . it every year. The NHS in England and Wales performs . over 140,000 hip and knee replacement operations every year as a result, . but almost any joint can be affected by the disease. However, there has been a lack of . effective therapies for the disease because before now the underlying . molecular causes have been unclear. But a new study revealed that . osteoarthritis-related tissue damage is caused by a molecular pathway . that is involved in regulating and responding to zinc levels inside of . cartilage cells. A protein . called ZIP8 transports zinc inside these cells, setting off a cascade . of molecular events that result in the destruction of cartilage tissue . in mice. As a result, reducing zinc levels could lead to a new generation of therapies for osteoarthritis. Jang-Soo Chun of the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in Korea said: 'No evidence available to date clearly indicated that zinc plays a causal role in osteoarthritis. 'In our study, we revealed the entire series of molecular events in the osteoarthritis zinc pathway, from zinc influx into cells to cartilage destruction.' Cutting down on foods that contain cocoa powder may be the key to reducing diseases like osteoarthritis . Chicken, one of the British food staples, might be a slight cause for diseases that can cause crippling joint pain, and in cutting down on them, people might be able to reduce the chances of developing the arthritic diseases later in life . The tissue destruction is caused by proteins called 'matrix-degrading enzymes', which are produced by cartilage cells and are the key culprits responsible for degrading the extracellular matrix-the structural support system that surrounds cells and holds them together. Seafood, such as salmon, and other fish, have been found as a strong source of zinc in our everyday diet . Because matrix-degrading enzymes require zinc to function, researchers suspected that zinc levels inside of cartilage cells may play a role in osteoarthritis. To examine the theory they first examined cartilage from osteoarthritis patients as well as a mouse model of the disease. They found abnormally high levels of a protein called ZIP8, which is embedded in the plasma membrane of cartilage cells and is involved in transporting zinc inside of these cells from the outside environment. Zinc influx through ZIP8 activated a protein called metal-regulatory transcription factor-1 (MTF1), which in turn increased levels of matrix-degrading enzymes in cartilage cells. Through genetic experiments in mice, the researchers showed that this zinc-ZIP8-MTF1 pathway plays a key role in causing osteoarthritis-related cartilage destruction. Jang-Soo Chun said: 'Our findings suggest that local depletion of zinc or pharmacological inhibition of ZIP8 function or MTF1 activity in cartilage tissue would be effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of osteoarthritis. 'We are hopeful that this research will lead to the discovery and rapid development of novel drugs to suppress the progression of this debilitating disease.'","Korean study reveals zinc rich foods could be the cause for osteoarthritis .

A Delaware jury convicted a pediatrician Thursday of waterboarding his partner's daughter by holding the child's head under a faucet. The jury deliberated for about six hours before returning its verdict against Melvin Morse, 60. Morse was charged with three felonies, two for alleged waterboarding and one for alleged suffocation by hand. He was convicted of one felony â€” waterboarding in the bathtub â€” and five misdemeanors. Guilty: A Delaware jury convicted pediatrician Melvin Morse, 60, of endangerment and . assault charges for waterboarding his stedaughter by holding the girl's head under a . faucet . Morse did not show any immediate reaction after the verdict. He could face several years in prison. Sentencing was set for April 11. Defense attorneys argued that 'waterboarding' was a term jokingly used to describe hair washing that the girl did not like. Morse was charged with endangerment and assault after the girl ran away in July 2012 and told authorities of waterboarding and other abuse. Morse, whose medical license was suspended after his arrest, has written several books and articles on paranormal science and near-death experiences involving children. He has appeared on shows such as 'Larry King Live' and the 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' to discuss his research, which also has been featured on an episode of 'Unsolved Mysteries' and in an article in 'Rolling Stone' magazine. Morse denied police claims that he may have been experimenting on the girl. Pauline Morse (left), who pleaded guilty to endangerment charges, testified against her husband, saying that he used waterboarding on their daughter as a threat and a form of punishment . Master of the house: The pediatrician was described by the prosecutors as a domineering figure who acted as the lord of his household . The girl's mother, Pauline Morse, 41, pleaded guilty last year to misdemeanor endangerment charges and testified against Melvin Morse. Pauline Morse and her daughter, now 12, said in court that Melvin Morse used waterboarding as a threat or a form of punishment. Waterboarding as used in the past by U.S. interrogators on terror suspects simulates drowning. Many critics call it torture. According to testimony, the . allegations of waterboarding surfaced after the girl ran away. The girl . went to a classmate's home the morning after Morse grabbed her by the . ankle and dragged her across a gravel driveway into the home, where she . was spanked and warned of worse punishment the next day. When investigators questioned the girl, then 11, she told them about what she called waterboarding. Prosecutors argued that in addition to . being waterboarded, Morse subjected the girl to other abuse, including . being forced to stand with arms outstretched for hours at a time; being . confined to her room, where she had to use her toy box or closet as a . toilet; and being deprived of food or force fed until she vomited. Prosecutor . Melanie Withers portrayed Melvin Morse as a brutal and domineering . 'lord and master' of his household, abusing the girl for years while her . mother acquiesced in silence. Media darling: In 1992, Morse (left) was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey, pictured holding up a copy of his book . Pauline Morse said she chose to ignore the abuse, saying she was afraid of 'undermining' Melvin Morse. She also testified that she did not have a close relationship with the girl for several years that encompassed the waterboarding, and that she did not pay her much attention. The girl and her younger sister remain in foster care but are allowed supervised visits with Pauline Morse. Pauline Morse said she hoped her cooperation with prosecutors will bolster her chances of being reunited with her daughters.","Melvin Morse, 60, was found gulty of waterboarding in the bathtub and could face prison time when he is sentenced in April .

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has been criticized for putting children at risk by failing to declare a snow day as blizzards hit the city on Wednesday. Teachers' unions and elected officials called the mayor's decision a 'mistake' as schools were kept open despite New York's governor declaring a state of emergency. NBC weather anchor Al Roker even took time out from his Olympic coverage to blast the mayor's snow policy, saying: 'It’s going to take some kid or kids getting hurt before this goofball policy gets changed.'

Safety fears: Weather anchor Al Roker complained that schools were open . Today show presenter Roker led the angry criticism of de Blasio after he kept New York City schools open while the rest of the state declared a state of emergency amid heavy snowfall. In an angry series of tweets Roker, whose daughter goes to school in the city, even forecast de Blasio would be a one-term mayor. He said: ‘Chancellor says Macy's is open, schools should be open. They're also open on Thanksgiving, nights and Sundays. Are you kidding?’ ‘And how about all the parents and caregivers who have to scramble to get their kids home? Is there no one there with any common sense?' Roker, who has twice been voted best weatherman, added: ‘Why are schools all around NYC . closed?

'I . understand the desire to keep schools open,' Michael Mulgrew, the . president of the city's union, told Politicker. 'The only thing that . trumps that is safety.

The response promoted Roker to say: 'Mr Mayor, I could never run NYC, but I know when it's time to keep kids home from school.' At . a press conference on Thursday morning, the mayor had said five to . eight inches of snow had fallen so far, but he expected up to 14in . by Friday morning. He . said that the city had put 1,900 snow plows on the roads and 475 salt . spreaders, as well as 800 workers shoveling at bus stops, streets and . fire hydrants - but urged people to clear their own walks and stay off . the road, if possible.

'Keeping schools open and expecting . children to travel through heavy snow, sleet and ice at the same time . the city is urging residents to stay off the road is nonsensical.'

Connect for Health Colorado, the state's Obamacare insurance exchange, is reeling after news surfaced that Christa Ann McClure, a top agency executive, will stand trial in Montana for embezzling from her previous nonprofit employer. McClure, 51, was hired as Director of Partner Engagement at Connect for Health Colorado in March 2013 after a thorough vetting. She hadn't yet been indicted in the case, which stemmed from her tenure at the helm of Housing Montana of Billings, a federal contractor. In 2007 the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave the organization a $514,454 grant, which McClure managed, to build 22 homes in rural areas. Charges were brought on January 16, and she pleaded not guilty in federal court on February 6, answering eight charges of theft and fraud from the nonprofit housing agency. A top program director with Colorado's Obamacare insurance exchange is facing 20 years in prison for defrauding the housing agency where she last worked . President Obama's re-election campaign was met in September by cheering Colorado throngs, just as Connect for Health was beginning a search that would culminate in McClure's hiring . It wasn't until Monday that she notified Connect for Health Colorado, which promptly placed her on administrative leave, according to The Denver Post. McClure is free pending trial in June. Her charges could bring between five and 20 years in prison . plus a fine of $250,000. Her Denver-based employer told the Post that she seemed perfect for the $130,000 job, since she had worked before with Medicare officials and both state and federal agencies. Spokesman Ben Davis said in a statement Wednesday that 'integrity and public trust are paramount to the mission of Connect for Health Colorado. We take extensive measures to protect consumer information and technology systems.' His organization is on full alert now, scrambling to explain itself to Coloradans. The charges against her are 'very serious, and we are taking this very seriously,' said Davis. A center-right advocacy group in Denver also sees the integrity lapse as no small thing. 'Coloradans deserve better than . someone who has been accused of fraud and theft running critical . components of the state health care exchange,' said Kelly Maher, . executive director of Compass Colorado. 'This is very serious. Coloradans have every right to be extremely concerned about these allegations.' Colorado's enrollment in Obamacare has reportedly been a mixed bag, with urbanites flocking to sign up but ranchers and mountain-dwellers becoming increasingly skeptical . Colorado's Obamacare exchange is busily signing up new insurance customers, but the organization's connections with federal Medicare overseers and other officials will get a hard look after McClure's departure . The embarrassing lapse in . human-resources quality control is just the latest in a string of health . insurance disappointments for the Obama administration. Some state-level marketplaces, such . as those in Washington, D.C. and California, have performed more or less . as they were designed to. But others have been plagued with . self-inflicted wounds as damaging as the one that made the Obama . administration's healthcare.gov a national punchline. Oregon's website, for instance, has yet to function properly. Now the federal government will likely have to question Connect for Health Colorado's accounting, and the architecture of its data processing, since so many millions of dollars are at stake. Federal contractors told MailOnline that the Department of Health and Human Services would likely have to commission an audit of the organization's finances. That could take a long time and leave in limbo the organization's ability to interface with federal government agencies including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Political analyst Floyd Ciruli told the Post that the entire episode 'simply . contributes to the fact that the overall implementation of . health-insurance reform has been troubled by an endless series of . embarrassments.' News of McCLure's charges came as the latest in a series of Colorado Obamacare hiccups, including nationwide attention last year focused on an enrollment campaign showing college students doing keg stands and getting drunk . McClure's federal indictment, published online by the Billings Gazette, alleges that between 2008 and 2010 she put 'significant sums' of money in her own pocket for consulting services that she was ineligible to bill for, since her executive director position was already a full-time job. She also steered money to family and friends for nonexistent work, federal prosecutors say, bought herself a personal laptop computer with federal funds, and cut herself an unauthorized check for $21,000 from the housing agency. Perhaps more original was McClure's alleged scheme to charge home buyers $750 for a nonexistent warranty, and $1,000 for renting tools that the federal government's grant provided. She steered that money, the government says, into a separate bank account over which she had more complete control. McClure's name is still listed as a staffer on Connect for Health Colorado's website. She did not respond for requests for comment.","Christa Ann McClure, 51, is charged with stealing tens of thousands of dollars from a nonprofit housing agency she ran in Montana .

Tragic: Two Virginia Tech students have been charged in the brutal murder of a fellow student, Samanata Shrestha, pictured . A Virginia Tech student and two of her friends have been charged in the brutal murder of a fellow female student who had just been accepted into medicine school. Jessica Michelle Ewing, 22, is accused of killing Samanata Shrestha, 21, a popular senior, some time after 7 a.m. Saturday in the Blacksburg area. Keifer Kyle Brown, a 23-year-old who graduated from the college last year, allegedly helped Ewing stash the body, and has been charged as an accessory in the murder. Another friend, Michael Christian Heller, a Blacksburg resident, was also arrested and is accused of helping to cover their tracks. Investigators have not yet determined a motive for the shock slaying, nor do they know how the three knew their victim or if they in fact did. The biology major from Vienna in Northern Virginia, who friends and family called 'Sam,' was reported missing by her concerned parents Saturday morning. They told police they hadn't heard from her since Friday and couldn't reach her. 'Something was wrong; that was my immediate reaction,' her mother, Rajshree Shrestha, who tragically lost another daughter in a motorcycle accident five years ago, told ABC News. 'Me and my husband said, ""This is not right.""' The complaint sparked a widespread search for the missing student. Finally, on Monday, investigators discovered Shrestha's body wrapped in a sleeping bag in the back seat of her car, a black 2004 Mercedes. The car was abandoned on the side of the road. University Herald is reporting that the victim was shot dead, however the school newspaper, the Collegiate Times, reports that she was strangled. Ewing was arrested Monday and has been charged with second-degree murder. Brown who was also arrested Monday faces accessory after the fact charges for helping to conceal the body. Heller was arrested Wednesday and is also charged with being an accessory. Suspects: Jessica Michelle Ewing, 22, left, is charged with murder and Keifer Kyle Brown, 23, a graduate, right, allegedly helped her stash the body . Ewing is a senior at the school, double majoring in fisheries science and biological sciences, according to the Collegiate Times. Brown graduated last August with a degree in interdisciplinary studies and Heller never attended the college but lives in the area. Ewing and Brown are both being held without bond. Brown is in the Montgomery County Jail, but Ewing has been transferred to the Western Virginia Regional Jail. Heller was released on $3000 bond. 'We have no idea what is the motive,' a family friend, Ram C. Kharel, told the Washington Post. Shrestha was a popular senior who was majoring in biology and minoring in medicine and society and psychology. Stunning: The beatiful and intelligent student, known as 'Sam' is pictured with her boyfriend . Sad: Virginia Tech has suffered it's share of tragedies, including a mass shooting in 2009 . She aspired to be a doctor, her parents said, and shortly before her death she had received some exciting news. 'Her . dream had been fulfilled,' her mother told ABC News. 'She wanted to . become a doctor and she has been accepted to the Penn State College of . Medicine.' Blacksburg Police Department Lt. Nathan O'Dell wouldn't comment on the ongoing investigation, but insisted he'd do all he could to ensure the those charged are convicted. 'We lost a very beautiful and intelligent person from our community and the Blacksburg Police will be very thorough and meticulous with our investigation to ensure the three we have charged are convicted in connection with this murder,' he told ABC News. The death has shaken the campus community and Shrestha's classmates were organizing a candlelight vigil in her honor, and a memorial fundraiser was being set up to benefit an organization where she volunteered. Killer? Jessica Ewing, pictured, was allegedly the shooter . In custody: The suspects, including Keifer, pictured left and right, are being held without bond at the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. They haven't yet entered pleas . 'That an inspiring young woman would lose her life to violent crime hurts beyond belief,' Virginia Tech President Charles Steger said in a statement. 'We extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to the family and will assist in any way possible. No amount of words can counteract their grief.' He added: 'We know such crime should not happen in a special place like Blacksburg, yet we also know from our own history and that of similar towns throughout our nation that crime can visit even the most placid communities.' Shrestha's academic adviser, Jack Evans, described the student to University Herald as eager to learn. She was 'like a wet sponge and just gobbled it all up,' he said. Ewing and Brown are scheduled to have preliminary hearings on April 17.

'It felt like someone had put a bicycle pump in my ear and was just pumping and pumping - the pressure in my head was horrendous. There are two types of meningitis - bacterial and viral. Viral meningitis is the less serious form. Viral meningitis is sometimes mistaken for flu as the symptoms are often mild.

Jett Travolta died at the age of 16, in January 2009, after suffering a seizure in the Travolta family holiday home in the Bahamas and hitting his head on the bath. Hardline church: John Travolta, pictured with wife Kelly Preston in Beverly Hills last month, was under 24/7 Scientology-watch for two years . Religious support: After Jett, pictured between his mother and father with sister Ella Bleu, died, John Travolta was assigned Scientology minders who followed him day and night . It was not until after his death that . Travolta acknowledged that Jett was autistic, something which he and . Kelly Preston, his wife of 23 years, had always vehemently denied as . Scientology does not believe autism exists. After . this, Travolta was surrounded by selected members of his religion, . potentially as a precaution to ensure he and his family would not stray . following the death of Jett.

DNA footprints left in the wake of ancient warriors can unravel long-held secrets about a country’s past. Now, for the first time, scientists have mapped the DNA of 95 different populations to see if they can paint a clearer picture of major historical events. This incredible interactive maps looks at the mixing of genes in major populations in Europe, Africa, Asia and South America spanning over the last four millennia. INTERACTIVE MAP: Double click on the location you want to view. You can then use the scroll bar on the left to zoom in . Double click on the location you want to view. You can then use the scroll bar on the left hand side to zoom into the map. Blue circles indicate the local populations. Orange shows the population that this group may have mixed with. The size of each circle represents the sample size used by the scientists. Grey circles, indicate that there was no admixture with populations, as is the case with England. The map reveals the genetic impact of European colonialism, the Arab slave trade, the Mongol Empire and European traders near the Silk Road mixing with people in China. ‘We made some very surprising discoveries,’ Dr Garrett Hellenthal of the University College London Genetics Institute told MailOnline. ‘For instance, the Kallash group are an isolated population in Pakistan. They are believed to be descendants of Alexander the Great's invading army, and our map doesn’t dispute that fact.' Many of the map’s genetic observations match historical events, and provide evidence of previously unrecorded genetic mixing. The group with the longest time since admixture is the Kalash from Pakistan. They have an ancient inferred event prior to 206BCE, involving mixing between a more European and West Asian group, and a more Central/South Asian group . Many Kalash people (left) believe they are descended from the army of Alexander the Great (right). The date shown in the interactive map does not rule this out but the date range also allows for many other possibilities . For example, the DNA of the Tu people in modern China suggests that in around 1200CE, Europeans similar to modern Greeks mixed with an otherwise Chinese-like population. Plausibly, said the researchers, the source of this European-like DNA might be merchants travelling the nearby Silk Road. The powerful technique, dubbed 'Globetrotter', also provides insight into past events such as the genetic legacy of the Mongol Empire. Historical records suggest that the Hazara people of Pakistan are partially descended from Mongol warriors, and this study found clear evidence of Mongol DNA entering the population during the period of the Mongol Empire. Six other populations, from as far west as Turkey, showed similar evidence of genetic mixing with Mongols around the same time. 'What amazes me most is simply how well our technique works,' said Dr Hellenthal. The Pima people are a group of Indigenous Americans living in an area consisting of what is now central and southern Arizona. Their genetic data reveals their ancestors came from far and wide with significant local populations with Maya heritage . This map of England was based on genetic data from 6 individuals. It shows that much of the admixture was with local populations in Wales, Ireland and Scotland. A tiny per cent of DNA was found to come from Palestine, but the researchers have described this as 'noise' and not reflective of the general population . An event which is easy to identify signal is the Mongol expansion. Seven populations in the sample are involved in the event. A second is the Arab slave trade, with DNA contributions from sub-Saharan Africa. people from around the Mediterranean, the Arabian Sea and the Persian gulf. The Mongol expansion seems, according to both history and genetics, to have been a particularly abrupt transfer of people and DNA across Asia. DNA of the Tu people in modern China suggests that in around 1200CE, Europeans similar to modern Greeks mixed with an otherwise Chinese-like population. Plausibly, the researchers say, the source of this European-like DNA might be merchants travelling the nearby Silk Road. 'Although individual mutations carry only weak signals about where a person is from, by adding information across the whole genome we can reconstruct these mixing events. ‘Sometimes individuals sampled from nearby regions can have surprisingly different sources of mixing.’ ‘For example, we identify distinct events happening at different times among groups sampled within Pakistan, with some inheriting DNA from sub-Saharan Africa, perhaps related to the Arab Slave Trade, others from East Asia, and yet another from ancient Europe. ‘Nearly all our populations show mixing events, so they are very common throughout recent history and often involve people migrating over large distances.' The team at UCL and Oxford University used genome data for all 1490 individuals to identify 'chunks' of DNA that were shared between individuals from different populations. They were able to pinpoint time frame when genetic mixing took place using genetic recombination – the biological process in which two DNA molecules exchange genetic information. Populations sharing more ancestry share more chunks, and individual chunks give clues about the underlying ancestry along chromosomes. 'Each population has a particular genetic “palette”’, said Dr Daniel Falush of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, co-senior author of the study. 'If you were to paint the genomes of people in modern-day Maya, for example, you would use a mixed palette with colours from Spanish-like, West African and Native American DNA.’ This mix dates back to around 1670CE, consistent with historical accounts describing Spanish and West African people entering the Americas around that time. The Mongol expansion seems, according to both history and genetics, to have been a particularly abrupt transfer of people and DNA across Asia . Researchers identified distinct events happening at different times among groups sampled within Pakistan (pictured), with some inheriting DNA from sub-Saharan Africa .

Some Kalash believe they are descended from the army of Alexander the Great. The date shown in the interactive map does not rule this out but the date range also allows for many other possibilities. Though we can't directly sample DNA from the groups that mixed in the past, we can capture much of the DNA of these original groups as persisting, within a mixed palette of modern-day groups,’ said Dr Falush. ‘This is a very exciting development.' As well as providing fresh insights into historical events, the new research might have implications for how DNA impacts health and disease in different populations. 'Understanding well the genetic similarities and differences between human populations is key for public health,' said Dr Simon Myers. Some populations are more at risk of certain diseases than others, and how well certain drugs work is also known to vary significantly. Rare genetic mutations are particularly likely to show strong differences between populations, and understanding their role in human health is an area of intense current research efforts. The researchers hope that in the future they can include even more detailed sequencing, to spot these rare mutations and better understand their global spread. ‘This really is a fascinating insight,’ said Dr Hellenthal. ‘Imagine just how much more can be found out with even more detailed sequencing.’ This graphic shows how a North African population and migrants from West Africa mixed in the ancestors of today's Mozabite people .","Map shows the mixing of genes of 95 different populations across Europe, Africa, Asia and South America .

A fantasy game enthusiast has been sentenced to life in prison for beating a former Pensacola newspaper reporter to death with a hammer and burying his body in a concrete-covered pit in Georgia. William Cormier III was so desperate for money that he killed Sean Dugas in the fall of 2012 so he could steal his $100,000 collection of fantasy role-playing cards for the game 'Magic: The Gathering,' prosecutors said. Jurors convicted Cormier today of first-degree murder after a little more than an hour of deliberations. Cormier III showed no reaction as the verdict was read. Guilty: William Cormier has been sentenced to life in prison for beating a former Pensacola newspaper reporter to death with a hammer and burying his body in a concrete-covered pit . Dugas' parents broke down in sobs as the verdict was read. His mother clutched a picture of her son. Prosecutor Bridgette Jensen told jurors during closing arguments that Cormier III used profits from selling the cards to pay for the plastic storage container that became Dugas' concrete-encased coffin. 'He sold Seans' own cards to buy that cheap, plastic coffin to put his body in,' Jensen said. Defense attorneys said prosecutors didn't prove that Cormier III killed Dugas, and instead suggested his twin, Christopher Cormier, was responsible. Cormier's twin brother pleaded no contest to charges of helping his brother move Dugas' body from Florida to Georgia. Court deputies escorted Christopher Cormier into the courtroom immediately after the verdict was read. Victim: Sean Dugas (pictured) was killed in the fall of 2012 for his $100,000 collection of fantasy role-playing cards for the game . Talented reporter: Sean Dugas was a journalist with the Pensacola News Journal from 2005 to 2010 . The two brothers sat in the courtroom, but did not look at each other as Dugas' family members gave testimony to the judge. They asked the judge to give both twins the maximum, and he did. Christopher Cormier was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Dugas' parents described their son to the judge. 'Bohemian, eclectic, unique, free spirit, all these words were used to describe Sean. The most important word to me was son. He was my only son,' Christopher Dugas said. Lois Jones, Dugas' mother, sobbed as she told the judge about her grief. 'I despise the fact that his supposed friends could hurt him like this. You must make sure they never hurt anyone else,' she said. Dugas' aunt told the judge that Dugas was a philosopher, talented journalist and someone who wanted to know 'what makes people tick'. Dugas was a reporter with the Pensacola News Journal from 2005 to 2010. Dugas' body was unearthed more than a month after his death, located in the backyard of Cormier's father's home in Winder, Georgia, which is about 300 miles northeast of Pensacola. Cormier III was the only witness to testify for the defense. He told jurors Wednesday he was acting under the direction of his twin and that he did not know Dugas' was dead when he sold more than $12,000 of his cards and cleaned out his home. 'His brother said, 'Here's a note from Sean wanting us to help him move'. His brother said 'Sean wants us to help him get some money and sell his Magic cards'. He didn't think anything of it, he trusted his brother,' defense attorney Richard Currey said. Witnesses, including the twins' father, testified Cormier III has always been the more-dominate twin and the leader. But Currey said that dynamic had changed before the killing. Defense: William Cormier's defense attorney Richard Currey (pictured left sitting with Cormier) said his client dominated over his twin, Christopher . Currey pointed to testimony from the twins' father, who said he thought Christopher Cormier was questioning his sexuality. Currey said Dugas' death could have been a 'crime of passion' by Christopher Cormier, but he didn't go into more details. Currey . said the fact that Dugas' body was wrapped in a bed sheet could be a . further indication that Christopher Cormier killed Dugas. Currey also told jurors the conflicting testimony between his client and other witnesses could be because the witnesses didn't remember things accurately. The prosecutor said Cormier III's conflicting statements helped prove he killed Dugas. Cormier III told a Dugas' neighbor that Dugas was moving with him to Georgia, he told another man that he owned Dugas' home and that Dugas was tenant who moved out and he told investigators that he helped to Dugas move to an unknown address in another city in Florida. 'He told you yesterday that he didn't do it. Every one of those 14 blow's to Sean's head say otherwise,' Jensen said. Dr. Cassie Boggs, an assistant medical examiner from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, said Dugas was in a fetal position in the storage container surrounded by sheets, a plastic tarp, air fresheners and spray foam used to seal cracks in walls. His body had to be cut from the bottom of the plastic bin because of the layer of concrete on the top, she said. Jurors were visibly upset by the graphic descriptions and images from the autopsy. One wept openly. Dugas' father looked down throughout that testimony. Dugas' mother, still clutching a photo of her son, left the courtroom. Also . Wednesday, Cormier's father told jurors that he received a call from a . Pensacola detective in October of 2012 asking about Dugas' disappearance. The father said he woke his twin sons up and told them . about the call. 'I said, 'What the hell is going on? There is a detective from Pensacola calling and somebody is missing',' he testified. Cormier III responded that he needed to move what was buried the backyard, the father said.

The 32-year-old last night wowed in the floor length ink blue gown at a black tie gala at the National Portrait Gallery - after having first worn it in October at a Kensington Palace dinner in aid of people with addictions. Part of one of the Duchess’s favourite designers, Jenny Packham’s Autumn/Winter collection, the dress features a low, sweeping, heart-shaped neckline and chiffon off-the-shoulder sleeves. The waist is accentuated with a contrasting black velvet belt and the skirt falls to the floor in soft pleats. At a cost of £2,000 it is little wonder the frugal Duchess was keen to get another event out of the dress. Catherine added some serious sparkle to the dress last night at the Portrait Gala with the Nizam of Hyderabad necklace, on loan from the Queen . The Duchess kept her neckline unadorned when she first wore the dress to the 100 Women in Hedge Funds Fundraising gala held for charity Action on Addiction in October . The . Nizam of Hyderabad asked the Queen to choose two pieces from Cartier to . mark her wedding in 1947 - and the then Princess Elizabeth chose a tiara and a . necklace based on an English rose. The . tiara was subsequently broken up to create other pieces but the . necklace remains intact. The Queen wears it occasionally still today. Queen Elizabeth II pictured in 1953 wearing the necklace, a wedding present from the Nizam of Hyderabad . The Nizam of Hyderabad necklace was originally created by Cartier in 1930s. It . consists of a long chain of 38 diamonds (reduced from the original 46) with a diamond-encrusted snap. The centre of the necklace is pave-set . with detachable double-drop pendant, 13 emerald-cut diamonds and a . pear-shaped drop. The original necklace consisted of eight double-drop and three triple-drop pendants. However, . nine of the pendants (all eight double-drop and the larger of the . triple-drop pendants) were later removed and sold separately. The necklace itself found its first owner in 1936 but Cartier repurchased it a year later. Blending her thrifty sensibilities with a respect for the royal institution, Kate caused a stir last night by pairing the dress with a priceless diamond necklace on loan from the Queen. The Nizam of Hyderabad necklace was given to Her Majesty as a gift when she married in November 1947. Perfectly displayed against the neckline of the dress, Kate’s jewels stole the show at the black tie Portrait Gala 2014 at The National Portrait Gallery. The Nizam of Hyderabad necklace was originally created by Cartier in 1930s. It consists of a long chain of 38 diamonds (reduced from the original 46) with a diamond-encrusted snap. The centre of the necklace is pave-set with detachable double-drop pendant 13 emerald-cut diamonds and a pear-shaped drop. However the Duchess has demonstrated the versatility of the gown when she wore it to more subtle effect just three months ago with minimal accessories. Attending the dinner for one of her charities Action for Addiction days after Prince George’s christening she left her décolletage bare and wore just a single bracelet and simple diamond earrings. She wore her hair down, with heavy eyeliner, blusher and nude lips to complete the elegant look. The 100 Women in Hedge Funds (100WHF) philanthropic initiatives dinner raised money for the charity Action on Addiction, of which she is patron. The Duchess has been slowly easing back into her royal duties, in particular supporting her personal charities, since the birth of Prince George last summer and will soon embark on an official visit to Australia with Prince William.","Kate wore the dress to gala last night at National Portrait Gallery .

The Prince of Wales is urging world leaders to target organised poaching gangs directly and take back their 'ill-gotten gains'. Charles made the comments in a major speech to the Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in London - gathered to tackle the threat to endangered animals like tigers, elephants and rhinos. Joined by his sons the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, the future king told the summit that the scale of the poaching crisis had reached 'unimaginable heights' in certain countries, and there was 'not a moment to lose' to safeguard threatened species.

Prince Charles said Asia's wildlife was also being 'decimated' but steps had been taken to tackle this . The Prince's speech comes as David . Beckham, The Duke of Cambridge and basketball star Yao Ming released a . video message urging people around the world not to support the trade in . rhino horn. The trio are filmed walking on the pitch at London’s Wembley Stadium surrounded by computer-generated rhinos. The . WildAid campaign video tells viewers that the world’s entire rhino . population could fit inside the stadium, but their numbers could be . increased by stopping the demand for rhino horn. Yao Ming, The Duke of Cambridge, and David Beckham are helping to promote the cause . Actor Jackie Chan also appeared in a separate video for the charity . In a separate video, actor Jackie Chan warns viewers that buying rhino horn supports the dark side of the trade. “You’re paying for guns, bullets, poisoned arrows, chainsaws, axes, and machetes to hack off the face of the rhino. And you are paying for the life of a beautiful creature,” he says. Charles, a long-term campaigner on wildlife conservation, praised the leaders and foreign government ministers for meeting at Lancaster House in London to address the issue. He said: 'Today, if I may say so, you . are breaking new ground by coming together and committing - at high . levels never before seen at a conference on this topic - to take urgent . action to put a stop to this trade, which has become a grave threat not . only to the wildlife and the people who protect them, but also to the . security of nations.

Charles told the delegates he played a . part in helping to bring them together after a group of African . leaders, including president Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon, who is . attending the conference, contacted him for help. He . said: 'The situation they described was indeed dire. The scale of the . poaching crisis their countries were facing had reached unimaginable . heights. 'Organised gangs, . terrorist groups and militia were slaughtering ever greater numbers of . elephants for their ivory and rhinoceros for their horns. Most . threatened of all, they said, is the elephant - an integral part of the . ecological and social fabric of the African continent and a keystone . species.' Prince Charles said Asia’s wildlife . was also being decimated but he gave an example of how successful . anti-poaching campaigns could have results. He said: 'Late in the last decade, an . aggressive public campaign led by WildAid and Chinese athlete Yao Ming - . combined with government bans on the use of shark fin soup at . government functions - caused a dramatic drop in public demand for the . product.'

Organised gangs, terrorist groups and militia were slaughtering ever greater numbers of elephants for their ivory and rhinoceros for their horns. Before the day-long conference began . Charles, William and Harry were shown a display of seized animal parts, . from a tiger head and skin and rhino horn to bear bile and the skin of a . Nile crocodile. Grant Miller, a senior officer with the UK Border Agency, told the royal party about a recent seizure of ivory hidden in . ball bearing parts and 12 live San Salvador rock iguanas from the . Bahamas found in the luggage of two passengers stopped at Heathrow . Airport. Prime Minister David Cameron was due to speak at the conference but his attendance was cut short so he could focus on the flooding in southern England. Mr Cameron dropped in at the summit but did not pose with the delegates and the royals for a 'family photo', and met leaders behind the scenes. It is hoped that the nations will sign a declaration that will commit them to a range of goals to combat poaching and illegal trade in animal parts. In a short address Foreign Secretary William Hague outlined the steps the conference would agree to take to tackle the 'unprecedented crisis'. He said there was 'some evidence to show how insurgent or terrorist groups can benefit from the trade' in endangered species, but the conference would result in a 'powerful declaration that will demonstrate to the world that we will not tolerate this abhorrent trade'. Mr Hague said the countries represented would 'commit ourselves to treat poaching and trafficking as a serious, organised crime in the same category as drugs, arms or people trafficking'. He said: 'Poachers think they can act with impunity. We will show them they are wrong.'There should be no weak link, we will all seek out those who commit these atrocious acts and use the full force of our national and international laws to break these criminal empires.' Prince William’s appearance at the summit comes days after he was photographed hunting - a decision described by animal rights campaigners as ‘unfortunate’. The prince spent the weekend at a Spanish hunting lodge owned by one of the richest men in the country, the Duke of Westminster, shooting wild boar and stag. William Hague (left) and David Cameron (right) both attended although the Prime Minister cut his visit short to focus on flooding in southern England . He and his brother Harry flew out last Thursday, along with a group of friends including Jecca Craig, whom Prince William is rumoured to have dated in the past. While the prince’s passion for saving rhinos, elephants and tigers from extinction was praised yesterday, his weekend activities had not escaped the attention of fellow campaigners. Dame Jane Goodall, a leading British primatologist, said she agreed the prince’s timing was unfortunate, but added: ‘The involvement of Prince William and Prince Charles has brought so much attention and it’s so important, because some of these species are actually vanishing.’","Future king addresses meeting of world leaders and foreign ministers .

Mugshot: Justin Bieber is fighting to stop the release of an embarrassing clip of him peeing in his jail cell after his January 23 arrest . A legal motion by Justin Bieber's attorneys to block the release of video footage that reportedly shows him urinating in a jail cell has been revealed. The images were taken by cameras inside a Miami police station after the 19-year-old was arrested for DUI. Miami police have already released one video of the pop star's arrest, in January, showing him getting a pat down at the station. But Bieber is afraid of a more embarrassing video which shows him urinating and his lawyers have asking the court to block the video from being released because it shows his ‘private parts’. Documents state that the 19-year-old . singer was captured by cameras ‘in various states of undress which show . intimate personal parts of the defendant's body’. The . papers say that various media outlets have requested the footage and . ask Florida County Court to order a stay on all requests of the teen in . state custody to prevent 'irreparable harm'. A source who . has viewed the video told TMZ: 'Justin is seen several times stumbling . around while he was taking his tests. As if he had a problem with his . balance ... [the video] also shows Justin taking his various tests and . eventually taking a piss. 'The . stumbling and going to the bathroom is obviously reason enough for his . attorneys to request it be sealed ... If I was trying to paint a picture . that my client was innocent ... I wouldn’t want a video of him . stumbling around and looking out of it to go public either. This isn't the first time that Beiber has been caught urinating in an inappropriate place. The . singer was filmed last year peeing in a mop bucket at  New York City . restaurant - for some reason saying 'F*** Bill Clinton' at the end of . the clip. The video . released last week shows Bieber being frisked by Miami police after he . was taken in for CUI, drag-racing and driving with an invalid license on . January 23.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office is expected to make a decision on the 19-year-old's fate in around a week . Behind bars: Footage shows Justin Bieber being frisked by Miami police after being taken into custody on January 23 . Complying with orders: Putting on a typically confident display, the 19-year-old singer can be seen strutting around as he follows the officer's orders . Legal woes: It has since been claimed he was under the influence of prescription drugs, including Xanax, and marijuana at the time of his arrest . Appearing . rather peeved by his arrest, the troubled Canadian pop star's entire . body was patted down by cops as he was forced to comply with their . orders.

Wearing . a dark hoodie, baggy black shorts and red trainers, the teen heartthrob . is told to remove his shoes as the search takes place. Although . the police officer in question seems to be paying close attention to . searching Bieber, they found nothing on him after the frisk took place. However, . it has since been claimed he was under the influence of prescription . drugs, including Xanax, and marijuana at the time of his arrest. Later . tests revealed his blood alcohol level was below the limit for drivers, . but at the age of 19, the young star is still two years underage. Bieber . told police after the arrest that he had been smoking marijuana and had . taken a prescription drug, claiming that his mother gave him the . medication. The singer could now be charged with felony vandalism after  allegedly pelting his neighbour's property with eggs last month. The . Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has sent the case to the . district attorney, with officers strongly recommending prosecution on a . more serious felony charge after an estimated $20,000 in damages was . caused. Fast and furious: The singer, right, was caught drag-racing through a residential area in his yellow Lamborghini . Lt. Dave Thompson . told TMZ: 'I went to the D.A.'s Office today with the paperwork, and I . want a felony.  Of course I want a felony.' The . website had previously posted a video purportedly taken in the middle . of the attack, which occurred in the upmarket Calibasas area, in which . the pop star seems to be heard taunting his neighbor. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office is expected to make a decision on the 19-year-old's fate in around a week. It . comes hot on the heels of his party pal Lil Za being charged with three . felonies in connection to a raid on Justin's $6million mansion last . week. It has been reported . L.A. County D.A. has charged the rapper with two counts of felony . possession of a controlled substance, and another relating to breaking a . jail telephone. Police made . the charges after they had initially been called to Justin's house . following the egg pelting incident. If found guilty he could face up to . nine years in prison. Za, . real name Xavier Smith, was arrested earlier this month when drugs, . believed to be Xanax and Ecstasy, were found at the mansion. Police arrive to raid Justin Bieber's Calabasas mansion after Los Angeles law enforcement executed a felony search warrant . Bieber has also been accused of abusing a flight attendant on a private jet until she was forced to hide in the cockpit. The . troubled teen singer and his entourage were also said to have smoked so . much marijuana on a flight between Canada and New Jersey that the . pilots were forced to wear oxygen masks. Bieber . his father Jeremy, 38, and ten friends travelled on the leased jet to . Teterboro airport ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday and were allegedly . so verbally abusive towards the female flight attendant that she refuses . to work for him again. Despite . several warnings, the singer and his father Jeremy would not stop . verbally abusing the flight attendant, and she eventually hid in cockpit . with the pilots to avoid Bieber and his entourage. According to an official report, the Bieber men were 'extremely abusive' towards the flight attendant. 'The . captain of the flight stated that he warned the passengers, including . Bieber, on several occasions to stop smoking marijuana', the official . report of the incident, obtained by NBC News, reads. 'The . captain also stated he needed to request that the passengers stop their . harassing behavior toward the flight attendant and after several . warnings asked the flight attendant to stay with him near the cockpit to . avoid any further abuse.' In addition to his pending criminal case in Florida, Bieber has another case pending in his native Canada. Last week he turned himself into Toronto authorities after being charged with assault on a limo driver. Flying high: Bieber and his father allegedly smoked weed on a private plane they took to the Super Bowl . Meanwhile, . it has been reported by PageSix that Bieber's waxwork has been taken . down after fans had continued to touch the figure. A . source told them: 'With no ropes or barriers to stop them, thousands of . fans have had their photographs taken with him since then — but it has . taken its toll.' TMZ . reported that the fight began when Bieber asked for the music to be . turned up. The driver obliged, but not as much as Bieber was hoping, so . he apparently stuck his hand through the partition to do it himself. The . driver swatted his hand away and then it allegedly erupted into a . full-on smack fest as Bieber hit the driver in the head multiple times. While . Justin has grown increasingly close to his father in the wake of his . legal woes, Patti Mallette - who raised the star as a single mother - . has admitted she has little control over her son's behaviour. She . told Access Hollywood Live: 'I've just gotta let go a little and let . him make some of his own decisions. He's growing up. He's 19. He's not . my baby.

A tanning addict who used a sunbed every day for three years was left with a horrific scar after a massive tumour grew on her face. Anna Taylor, 33, spent an hour each night - six nights a week - under the tanning bulbs in her spare room. After more than 900 hours on a sunbed she gave up the habit in favour of fake tan lotion and kept out of the sun to avoid wrinkles. Anna Taylor, 33, developed skin cancer after overusing a sunbed. She needed 29 stitches after she had the 5p-sized tumour removed from beside her nose . But the damage was already done and in January last year doctors discovered a tiny spot on her face was cancerous. Surgeons were forced to cut a chunk out of her cheek leaving her needing 29 stitches. She now has a huge scar from her eye to her mouth. Ms Taylor, from Worthing, West Sussex, said: ‘I was confident about my looks before my surgery. ‘Now, at 33, and with a lifelong scar stretching most of the way down my face, I am reminded daily that my vanity backfired. ‘The scar will fade slightly but I will always be left with a mark. Ms Taylor (pictured before she developed the tumour) said: 'I think I just felt at the time it wasn't doing any harm because it wasn't the sun, which of course is stupid' Ms Taylor started using a sunbed when she was 18 and eventually had one in her spare room . ‘I am desperate to get the message to young girls, teens and even ladies my own age that sunbeds are simply not worth the risk - I know that now.’ The radio presenter first hired a sunbed for two weeks ahead of a holiday to Ibiza when she was just 18. Basal cell carcinoma is a type of non-melanoma skin cancer. These are skin cancers that develop slowly in the upper layers of the skin. They are more common than melanomas which spread quickly around the body. The first sign of the tumour is usually the appearance of a lump or patch of skin that doesn't heal. In most cases, cancerous lumps are red and firm while cancerous patches are flat and scaly. Basal cell carcinoma starts in the cells lining the bottom of the epidermis and account for about 75 per cent of skin cancers. The exact cause is unknown but it is thought to be linked to overexposure to UV light. The chance of developing the cancer is higher in people with a family history of the condition, in people with pale skin and in those with lots of freckles. The condition affects about 100,000 new patients in the UK every year. Surgery is the most common treatment. Source: NHS Choices . She then spotted one in the classifieds . section of her local newspaper for £50 and snapped it up, spending half . an hour on each side every night except Sunday. She gave up the sunbed in her early 20s - but unbeknown to her, the damage was already done. She first noticed a tiny spot on her left cheek near her nose in 2010 but dismissed it after a doctor said it was nothing more than a little scar. But the blemish grew and after two people commented on it she went to see another doctor in January last year. After a quick look with a magnifying glass, he announced it was a skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma - caused by exposure to UV rays. Ms Taylor, who is single, said: ‘I felt sick, absolutely sick. ‘They kept saying to me you must sunbathe, but I don't - I'm very vain and I don't like my freckles and I don't want wrinkles. ‘They kept saying it was very rare for someone my age to have this and that certainly didn't make me feel any better. ‘It was only when the fifth or sixth person said about the sunbathing that I suddenly remembered about the sunbeds. ‘I loved the feeling of the warmth on my face and it made me feel healthy. ‘I think I just felt at the time it wasn't doing any harm because it wasn't the sun, which of course is stupid.’ Surgeons . at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Sussex cut out the tumour - about the . size of a 5p - and the surrounding tissue in two 30 minute operations in . June. Ms Taylor, who . was only under local anaesthetic, said: ‘I could see them there, peering . down at me as they cut it away, and I could smell the flesh burning as . they stopped the bleeding. Ms Taylor was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma - skin cancer that is caused by exposure to UV rays - after developing a spot on her face . Ms Taylor (pictured after her operation) used a sunbed daily for three years between the ages of 18 and 21 but stopped using them when she was in her early 20s . ‘It was horrid - really, really horrible. ‘It felt like it was massive on my face and they were just cutting and cutting. ‘There . were times when it felt like it was really brutal as they were cutting . the roots out and I was left with a lot of bruising. ‘When I finally took a peak under the bandages it was awful. ‘I looked like something out of a horror movie - it truly looked like special effects make up.’ Ms Taylor says she worried her scar would damage her confidence but that she is coming to terms with it . Two days later, surgeons patched up the gaping hole in her face by stretching the surrounding skin. But they had to slice her face from just below her eye to her mouth, to give them enough skin to create a flat scar and avoid puckering. Ms Taylor said: ‘It was horrible. The . shallow side of me thought I looked horrible and I'm single and nobody . in their right mind is going to want to date someone like that. ‘I thought this is going to kill my confidence and I'm not going to be able to do anything.’ Ms Taylor says she would encourage other young women to use fake tan instead of sunbeds . Ms Taylor said: 'I was confident about my looks before my surgery. Now, at 33, and with a lifelong scar stretching most of the way down my face, I am reminded daily that my vanity backfired' But Ms Taylor is coming to terms with her scar and wants to persuade tanning addicts to ditch the harmful habit. She said: ‘There is no point and no excuse for going on sunbeds, especially with all the self-tan products out there now. ‘I know first-hand how damaging it can be. ‘I feel fine 90 per cent of the time and it is amazing how you can just forget about it, but it is always going to be there.’ Ms Taylor now wants to warn other people of the dangers associated with using sunbeds .","Anna Taylor used a sunbed for an hour every day for three years .

Manhattan chef Diego Moya, 30, was having a pizza slice while working home from meeting friends about 11pm Tuesday when he was ambushed by a group of six to eight men, aged from 16 to 21. Defenseless, he was punched and kicked repeatedly and suffered a broken jaw and nose, reports CBS Philly. Serious Condition: Manhattan chef Diego Moya, 30, was on a Thanksgiving visit to Philadelphia when he was bashed by a group of men about 11pm Tuesday in a suspected 'knockout game' attack . Before the attack: Diego Moya is seen here in a shot of him at work in New York. He suffered a broken jaw and nose and had to undergo serious surgery as a result of his assault . Moya was taken to hospital and had to undergo several hours of surgery for his injuries. Deflatedly he wrote about the experience on his Facebook page. 'I am sad. I wish I was mad but I sit here in this hospital bed sad,' Moya posted. Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel says detectives are looking for the motive for the attack, but have determined it random. They are also looking into whether it is linked to the 'knockout game' that has claimed several victims across the country. The prank preys of innocent people in the street, with 'players' aiming to knockout passersby by with just one hit. It is then bragged about online. It was 11pm Tuesday night when Diego Moya was attacked by a gang of men here at Market Street between 2nd and 3rd in Philadelphia . 'They just want to see if you got enough strength to knock somebody out,' one person posted anonymously on social media. In Philadelphia alone, there have been three other knockout-related assaults. According to NJ.com, one man in New Jersey has died from a broken neck as a result of the so-called game. On Monday, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey held a press conference warning there would be serious consequences for anyone taking part in 'knockout' attacks. Sweeping the country: Innocent people all over America have been targeted as part of the 'knockout game', as this video grab shows. Doctors say it is more dangerous than being hit in a fight because the unexpectedness affects the way your body handles the assault . Hit from behind: This victim had no idea they were about to be attacked when they were knocked out on the street in daylight . 'You’re also hurting another human being for no reason at all' Nutter said. 'There’s no excuse for this kind of behavior, it will not be tolerated here in the city. 'We will do everything we can to both prevent, but if someone does engage, we will catch you. 'You’ll be prosecuted, and your life will be changed dramatically.' So far, no suspects are in custody for the attack on Moya.","Diego Moya, 30, was walking home from dinner with friends on Market St in Philadelphia about 11pm Tuesday .

Cameraman: Bruce York saw the mysterious object Saturday evening, while driving near South Paris, Maine . He immediately posted the video to YouTube and Facebook in hopes of getting an answer about the mysterious falling flame. 'It didn't look like anything that I've ever seen before,' Mr York told WMTW. 'It didn't look like any footage I've ever seen of a meteorite or a comet. It just struck me as odd.' As of Thursday the video on YouTube had garnered nearly 23,000 views, and several people on the internet have stepped up to identify the enigma. Some say it could be a contrail from an airplane or a fuel dump. 'I really don't dare to wager one way or another what it is. I really don't,' Mr York said. 'I just, I'm hoping somebody will contact me and say ""OK, Here's what happened. Here's what he caught on video.""' The most confident answer came from Edward Gleason, a staff astronomer at Southworth Planetarium at the University of Southern Maine.

The IPCC is investigating South Yorkshire Police over the handling of a complaint made against paedophile singer Ian Watkins . The police watchdog is investigating a second force over the handling of complaints made against paedophile rock star Ian Watkins. Watkins, the lead singer of the Welsh group the Lostprophets, is due to be sentenced next month after he admitted to a string of horrific child sex offences including attempting to rape a fan's 11-month-old baby boy. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is already investigating claims that South Wales Police failed to act quickly enough having allegedly been told Watkins was planning to abuse children as early as 2008. They have now launched a second investigation over the handling of a complaint made against Watkins to South Yorkshire Police in 2012. An IPCC spokesman said: '‬The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is independently investigating South Yorkshire Police’s handling of information concerning allegations against Ian Watkins made in 2012. 'This follows a referral from South Yorkshire Police in September.' Watkins, who was described in court as a 'determined and committed paedophile', was arrested late last year after South Wales Police raided his home on a drugs tip and stumbled upon hard drives containing images, videos and conversations about him attacking children. From early 2010 horrified fans who had become friends with Watkins went online to beg for help after discovering vile images on his computer. Friends claim they called police to tell them the 36-year-old was a paedophile but officers did nothing, allowing him to go on to subject babies to the most horrific abuse. A disturbing child porn profile created in that time by Watkins was viewed by more than 40,000 people on the internet and yet appears never to have been monitored by authorities. In one post, written before his arrest, a fan wrote: ‘His on-off girlfriend reported him to police twice for being a paedophile. ‘He sent pornographic pictures of a little girl to a few girls telling them it was a five-year-old girl he’d raped. He also watches child porn constantly. Sick sick man.’ Watkins allegedly boasted to obsessed female fans that he had HIV and was on a mission to pass it on to children. The comments will only add to the growing . fear that Watkins's guilty pleas offer only a glimpse of the true . extent of his drug-fuelled debauchery. Watkins, 38, is due to be sentenced next month after . he admitted to a string of horrific child sex offences including . attempting to rape a fan's 11-month-old baby boy . Former . girlfriend Joanna Majic, 38, warned this week that sex predator Watkins . had abused hundreds of young victims during years of secret offending. She . claimed besotted female fans of the paedophile are hiding the true . extent of his offending because they secretly offered their children for . abuse. She repeatedly reported Watkins to the police from 2008 onwards but her accusations were not acted on at the time. One fan added: ‘A girl found info on . his computer on how to drug children. He told her he was thinking of . giving kids drugs. He does need to be arrested before he infects anyone . else.’ It emerged that he . was filmed committing the sex acts on the baby boy the day after . Lostprophets final album Weapons was released. Watkins, . a former boyfriend of BBC radio and television presenter Fearne Cotton, . appeared on BBC Radio 1 just hours before the incident in April last . year. The 36-year-old, from Pontypridd, South . Wales, plotted the shocking abuse with the two mothers of the babies in a . series of text and internet messages. Upset: Miss Majic says the scale of Watkins' abuse is being hidden by fans who were complicit in allowing him attack children, she claims . The baby's mother, Woman A, admits aiding and abetting the attempted rapes on her son. She also admits sexually touching the child and taking photographs, before sending them to Watkins. Watkins also admitted conspiring to rape and sexually touch the daughter of the second fan. He admits aiding and abetting Woman B to touch her daughter while he watched on Skype. An . earlier court hearing was told police had 72 pages of conversations . between the pair online talking about their sexual relationship. Woman B mentioned she had a daughter of a young age and Watkins said: 'Bring her along as well.' She said she was getting the child ready for their meeting together - and 'what they all will do together' when they meet up. She . admits sexual assault after touching the child, she also admits taking . an indecent photograph of the child before distributing them. Nobody from South Yorkshire police was available for comment. Anyone who has been affected by the Watkins case, or other cases of child abuse, is urged to contact South Wales Police on 029 20634184 or the NSPCC on 0808 800 5000.","IPCC investigating South Yorkshire Police over complaint made in 2012 .

The name’s Cameron, but you can call me Dave. All my regulars do. Beautiful British name, Dave. Just like the other half, Sam. Dave and Sam. Beautiful British names. That’s Sam, as in Samantha, not as in Sam. Wouldn’t want you getting the wrong impression. Not that I’ve anything against it, mind you. Far from it. In my humble opinion, same-sex marriage is the best thing since John Smith’s smooth bitter. We’ve just opened a gay bar in the old tap room. If you’re that way inclined, you’ll find it down the corridor, past the chillax zone and next to the nappy-changing facilities in the gents’ toilets. And we’ve just started a transgender night, every other Tuesday. If Dave was a pub landlord: Mail columnist Richard Littlejohn imagines what might have been... Now then, what can I get you? White wine, or a fruit-based drink? Perhaps a pint of Old Peculier for the little lady? We don’t go in for traditional stereotypes here, pal. Most of our gentleman regulars favour a dry white wine, especially our crisp, fair-trade Sauvignon Blanc from the Sudan. Either that, or a sparkling mineral water from the North Pole. There’s a lot of spare water in the Arctic Circle these days, what with the melting of the polar ice caps. An old school chum of mine has just set up a bottling plant in Lapland. Of course, we do our best to combat climate change here at the Coalition Arms. You may have noticed the state-of-the-art wind turbine on our roof. And the solar panels. Unfortunately they’re not working right now, because of the gale-force winds and the flooding, so we’re on an emergency wood-fired generator. If the lights go out, as they do quite often these days, please don’t panic. Frankly, all this green crap is a . complete waste of time and costs a fortune, but the second-home, . Guardian-reading crowd like it and they spend a lot of money in here of a . weekend. So, that’s a quinoa-infused cocktail for you and a pint of wallop for the little lady. That’ll put hairs on your chest, madam. And why not? If a woman wants hairs on her chest, good luck to her, I say. Or anywhere else for that matter. Depilation is just another form of male chauvinist oppression, that’s what I’ve always said. If a lady wants to go out for a drink wearing nothing but a skimpy bikini, even though she’s got more body hair than Dave Lee Travis, that’s entirely her own affair. She’ll be very welcome in here. My gaff, my rules! I’m sorry, here’s me rabbiting on and I haven’t asked your names. Mustapha and Nefertiti? Beautiful British names. And what do you do, sir? Midwife, eh? That’s marvellous, a proper man’s job. And . the little lady? Don’t tell me, let me guess. Chief executive of a . Footsie 100 company? Thought so, got it in one. Sam was a professional . woman in her own right, too, until she gave it up when we took over this . pub. She helps out . lunchtimes when my assistant bar manager, young Clegg, is on a day off . or throws a sickie, which is increasingly often. You just can’t get the staff these days. Still, it’s not for ever. We don’t expect to be here more than five years. Sam . also supervises the food. We specialise in organic, ethically sourced, . healthy fare. Low fat, low sodium, low carb, high prices. We’ve got a . dedicated vegan menu and only use ingredients grown in our own pub . garden. Unfortunately, we’re buying frozen veg from Iceland at the moment, because the garden has been under water since Christmas. Do you know, we had a geezer the other day asking for pub grub. I think he was from the Police Federation. I . told him: we don’t do pub grub. Pub grub’s for plebs, not sophisticated . modern metrosexuals. Grubs is what birds eat. The feathered kind, I . mean. I’d never call a little lady a ‘bird’. I barred him on the spot. We don’t want his type in here. My gaff, my rules! If we didn’t have rules, where would we be? France! And just look at France today. Seventy-five per cent top rate tax, President Hollande spending all his time chasing skirt. He turned up here yesterday for a pub lunch with the Prime Minister, Al Murray. I barred both of them. No . wonder the French are all moving to Britain in droves. We’re packed out . with Froggies when the rugby’s on the big screen. They can’t get enough . of Sam’s five-grain baguette and artisan Camembert. It’s . not just the Frogs, either. Don’t get me started on immigration. They . come over here, they take our jobs. Good luck to them, I say. The more . immigrants, the better. I’d . far rather employ a hard-working plumber from Eastern Europe than some . of the workshy cowboys we’ve had over the years. No wonder the country’s . flooded. We’ve got a lovely . Albanian woman comes in to do the ironing. Sam draws the line at . ironing and I don’t blame her. Bukuroshe, she’s called. Beautiful . British name. Well, it is now, anyway. Distant cousins: Littlejohn's flight of fancy has been inspired by the revelation that the Prime Minister, left, and television comedian Al Murray, the Pub Landlord, share a common ancestor in William Makepeace Thackeray . Can I top you up, sir? How about something a little stronger? Absinthe, perhaps? Oh, you’re driving. Probably very wise, sir. But if I may be permitted a suggestion, why not take a bike next time? You’ll find a Boris bike docking station outside the front door. That way you can drink as much as you like and save the planet on the way home. Just the bill? Certainly, here you are. I’m sorry, sir, we don’t take euros, just good old-fashioned English pounds. Not even from our French clientèle. That’s just the way it is. My gaff, my rules! Well, not entirely my rules, if I’m honest. Most of them come from Brussels these days, but I’ve had a word with the LVA and we are hoping to renegotiate the terms of our arrangement with our European suppliers in the very near future. Who’s next? You, the elderly couple. Sorry to have kept you waiting. Name’s Cameron, but you can call me Dave. And you are? Charles and Camilla. Camilla and Charles. Beautiful British names. And what can I get you? So that’s a pint of Dirty Monkey for you, Camilla, and a large Glenhoddle chaser. And what’ll Charles have — fruit-based drink or dry white wine? Better make it a fruit-based drink if he’s driving  the helicopter. Look, I’m afraid you can’t smoke in here, Camilla. I know, it’s my gaff and if they were my rules you could smoke like the Flying Scotsman. They’ll be stopping us smoking in  our own cars next. Darts? Sorry, no darts. Elf’n’safety. They’ve started sending undercover inspectors to check up and I can’t afford the fines. It’s not always easy to spot them, because they wear hi-viz jackets to blend in with everyone else. And what do you do? Pull the other one, Chas. If you’re the heir to the throne, then I’m the Prime Minister. Cheers!","Genealogists have discovered that David Cameron and Al Murray, the Pub Landlord, are distant cousins. Both are descended from the Victorian novelist William Makepeace Thackeray, best known for Vanity Fair. This got me wondering what might have happened if fate had taken a different course.

A choirmaster who allegedly raped a pupil at a leading private school told the girl that she 'bewitched him' while grooming her, a court heard today. Former National Youth Choir director Michael Brewer is accused of tying the girl to a . bed with a belt before being told by his wife Hilary to . ‘show her what he’d done to her’. The pair, both 68, are on trial over sex offences dating back more than 30 years, with the former choirmaster alleged to have had a two-year teacher-pupil . affair. Trial: Michael Brewer appeared at Manchester Crown Square Crown Court charged with rape and six counts of indecent assault following a police investigation, along with his wife Hilary Brewer . The alleged victim detailed how their . relationship progressed in 1978 when she was aged 14 from hugs in his . school office to kisses, intimate touching and then full sex. Giving evidence at Manchester Crown Court today, she said: 'Very quickly Mike would . tell me that I bewitched him. That he found me irresistible, that he . found me wise and wonderful, hugely talented and that these feelings . could not be wrong because they felt so right. The former pupil told the . court that she had felt 'nurtured in many ways' and that Brewer made her . feel 'special' and 'flattered'. She added: 'I did not feel at the . time I was a victim. It was a relationship that developed in a . completely normal way. We would kiss, he would touch me.' Nurtured: The former pupil, giving evidence at Manchester Crown Court, said that Michael Brewer told her she 'bewitched him' She told the jury she had not had any normal relationships at that stage after being abused by an uncle at a much earlier age. 'I now realise I was at the hands of paedophiles,' she said. Most of the abuse was said to have taken place in his office and his camper van which was parked on the grounds of Chetham’s . School in Manchester. She said the pair would often go into . the van together and said 'it was very easy for a teacher to take a . student out of school in those days'. The woman added: 'He liked me to perform oral sex on him when he drove.' She said their relationship 'intensified' when she was 15, becoming more obvious to others at the school. Sexual relations also took place when . she visited the then Brewer family home in Chorlton, Manchester, as his . ex-wife and children slept upstairs, she alleged. She eventually left the school to . study abroad but received a stream of letters from Brewer who signed . them Mat - which she said stood for Middle Aged Teacher. 'I had almost daily letters telling . me how much he loved me, how he missed me, he was going to leave his . wife when the time was right,' she explained. Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, previously told . the court Brewer was a brilliant and charismatic teacher whose only . problem was that he ‘could not keep his hands off’ the girls at the school. Prestigious: Brewer was director of music at the renowned Chetham's School in Manchester until 1994 . The alleged abuse culminated when she . visited the couple at home aged 18 and was told Mrs Brewer knew of the . affair. Mrs Brewer is said to have told the teenager ‘she had always . wanted a sexual relationship with a woman’ and that the girl ‘owed her’ because of what had happened with her husband. The girl was taken upstairs and forced . to take part in a sex act by Mrs Brewer, who displayed a ‘great . thrill’, said Mr Cadwallader. She was loosely tied to a bed using a . belt, the jury was told, before Mrs Brewer told her husband to ‘show her . what he’d done’ to her, and the pair had sex. Brewer went on to target at least two more girls, the court was told, one of which resulted in a sexual affair. The first, a boarder at Chetham’s at . the same time as the alleged victim, was said to have been propositioned . during a school trip when she was 17. Brewer pinned her up against the wall . in a dark corridor and told her ‘You want it really, don’t you?’, Mr . Cadwallader said. But she told him to ‘**** off’, ducked out of the way . and ran back to her dormitory, he said. Around 15 years later, in the . mid-1990s, Brewer allegedly groomed a 16-year-old, first giving her . ‘platonic’ hugs in his office before moving on to kisses. Court hearing: The charges relate to the alleged abuse and rape of a teenage girl . Eventually he began helping to take . off her top and suggesting she perform a sex act on him, the court . heard. But one evening principal Peter Hullah knocked on Brewer’s door . and heard ‘scuffling’.Brewer called out ‘Wait a minute’ and, when Mr . Hullah was allowed in, the girl could be seen exiting by a second door. Following an inquiry that year, 1994, Brewer resigned. The trial was told the original . alleged victim later told several people of her affair with Brewer but . never directly complained to police. However three decades on she told a . doctor who did inform detectives, resulting in the now divorced . couple’s arrest. The court heard the former pupil had been a hugely gifted musician. But she was also a disruptive, . badly-behaved teenager who used alcohol from a young age and had been . sexually abused by a relative. Brewer groomed her and the later pupil . through flattery, Mr Cadwallader said, ‘commenting on their figure, . their dress’ and also ‘their musical talent’. He would encourage the first girl to . take part in sex acts in his office, telling her to use a side door . rather than the main entrance so his secretary didn’t become suspicious, . the jury was told. Her bad behaviour eventually led to her being suspended, and she was sent to live with the Brewers. By the time she was 15 he was treating . her as his girlfriend, taking her to pubs and allegedly indecently . assaulting her beside a canal. Court: The pair have both pleaded not guilty at their trial at Manchester Crown Court, pictured . She went to study music abroad when . she was 16, but on her return to Britain went to visit the Brewers where . the alleged rape took place. At the time, she didn’t regard what happened as abuse and saw it as ‘a small price to pay for the affection’ he showed her. ‘The prosecution case is very much . that he abused that position using his power, influence and personality . to seduce her,’ Mr Cadwallader added. The alleged victim began her evidence yesterday by describing how her home life was ‘hell’. She said she thought Brewer was ‘the bee’s knees’, ‘a special teacher’ who needed to be ‘worshipped’ by his pupils. Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, denies one count of rape and 13 counts of indecent assault. His ex-wife, of Rossendale, Lancashire, denies one count of indecent assault and one of aiding and abetting rape. The trial continues.

Quiet kid: Darion Aguilar is the suspected gunman who shot two dead before turning the gun on himself at a Maryland mall Saturday . A Maryland mall shooter who killed two skate store employees last weekend wrote about killing people in his journal and said he was ready to die, police revealed Wednesday. Darion Aguilar did not mention targeting specific people or locations in his writing, according to Howard County Police, but rather expressed 'a general hatred of others' and acknowledged he had a mental illness. The 19-year-old is believed to have shot dead young mother, Brianna Benlolo, 21, of College Park, and Tyler Johnson, 25, of Mount Airy, in a Zumiez skate store at the Mall in Columbia and then took his own life. Detectives have as yet failed to find a motive in the shootings, but they said the pages of his journal, which had sporadic entries over a one-year period, show he 'knew he was having mental health issues.' 'Aguilar mentions killing people, but in general terms. he does not mention the victims, or any other specific person,' Howard County police said through Twitter. '(He) indicates he thought he needed a mental health professional but never told his family. He also mentions using marijuana.' He also apologized to his family for what he was planning to do and said his 'plan was set' without referring to what the plan was, police said. Also on Wednesday, new details were released about how Aguilar prepared for the horror shooting. Aguilar carried the disassembled 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun into the mall in a backpack and put the shotgun together in a dressing room at the Zumiez skateboard store. 'Police believe Aguilar exited the Zumiez dressing room, shot the two victims and then himself,' they said. Scroll down for video . Dispute: Multiple reports are saying Tyler Johnson (left) and Briana Benlolo (right) were shot dead by 19-year-old Darion Marcus Aguilar . Shot dead: Benlolo was a doting mother to a two-year-old boy . Earlier, investigators had said that Aguilar had spent at least an hour in the mall before initiating the spree. The skate store itself had no video cameras so there is no footage of the shootings. Another . victim, who was shot in the foot on the upper level of the mall, was . identified as Susan Kay Straumanis, 49, from Hanover. Shooter Darion Marcus Aguilar, 19, from College Park, had no criminal history as an adult, Howard County Police Chief Bill McMahon said at a Sunday press conference. He said the troubled teen bought the gun used to commit the murders legally early in December. McMahon . revealed at the conference that investigators had seized a journal from . the home of Aguilar which expressed unhappiness with his life. The . Prince George's County Police Department said it received a missing . persons report for Aguilar at about 1:40 p.m. Saturday, more than two . hours after the mall shooting. Recent graduate: The senior yearbook photo of Darion Aquilar from the Blake High School, Silver Spring, Maryland yearbook . Officers . went to Aguilar's home to speak with his mother about 5 p.m. and saw . Aguilar's journal. The portion the officer read made him concerned for . Aguilar's safety, the department said. Police began tracking Aguilar's phone and soon discovered it was at the mall. Howard . County Police Chief William McMahon said the journal expressed general . unhappiness, but at that point, he did not give any specifics about the . writings. 'There are a lot of unanswered questions,' McMahon said Sunday. McMahon . said the police investigation has not revealed any relationship between . the victims and the shooter, but Benlolo and Aguilar lived close to one . another. 'So far, our . investigation has not shown a relationship. I'm not saying that it . doesn't exist. We are focusing on any potential relationship, not one . victim over the other,' he said. McMahon . said detectives have interviewed family and friends of the victims and . the gunman but still do not have a motive for the crime. The . mall reopened for business on Monday, but McMahon said 'Nothing's going . to go back to normal. This mall is going to be different because of . what happened.' Investigation: Howard County Police Chief William J. McMahon identified the gunman as Darion Marcus Aguilar at a press conference Sunday morning . Shooter's home: The home of Darion Marcus Aguilar of College Park, Maryland, is seen Sunday, January 26, 2014 . Aguilar can been seen on surveillance footage arriving at the mall at 10:15 a.m. He . took a taxi to the Mall in Columbia in suburban Baltimore on Saturday . morning and entered the building near Zumiez, a shop that sells . skateboarding gear. He . went downstairs to a food court directly below the store, then returned . less than an hour later, dumped the backpack in a dressing room and . started shooting, police said. His dumbfounded mother described him as 'a gentle, sweet kid' who has never been interested in guns. 'If . you were to go in his room you would see what a gentle sweet kid he . was,' she said, adding that he was a vegetarian because he was concerned . about animal welfare. 'I . don't know what happened, I really don't. It's so unusual, you can talk . to any of his friends and find out what a gentle person he was. 'I . don't know, he's never had a gun before, never been interested in guns . or anything like that. I just don't know what happened, I just don't . know what happened.' The . woman, who didn't give her name, told reporters she didn't believe her . son knew his victims, contradicting earlier local radio reports that he . had dated Benlolo. Tragic: Aguilar took a cab to the Columbia mall an hour before he shot dead young mother Brianna Benlolo, pictured . Silent and deadly: Witnesses say no words were exchanged between the victims and the shooter before shots were fired . Lock down: An officer is seen outside a mall in Columbia, Maryland, where three people died in this picture provided by David Anderson . Locked down: Emergency responders closed the mall as they searched for additional shooters . 'I feel for those other parents, I do,' she added, sobbing. When . asked if she knew he had bought the 12-gauge shotgun in December, she . said: 'We have no guns in our house, we've never had guns in our house.' The . shooting baffled investigators and acquaintances of Aguilar, a quiet, . skinny teenager who graduated from high school less than a year ago and . had no previous run-ins with law enforcement. Police spent Sunday trying . to piece together his motive, but it remained elusive. Aguilar, . who had concealed the shotgun in a bag, fired six to nine times. Victim . Brianna Benlolo, lived half a mile away from Aguilar in the same . College Park neighborhood, but police said they were still trying to . determine what, if any, relationship they had. The other employee, Tyler Johnson, did not know Aguilar and did not socialize with Benlolo outside of work, a relative said. Although . they lived close to Maryland's largest university, neither was a . student there. Aguilar was accepted last February to Montgomery College, . a community college in the Washington suburbs, but school spokesman . Marcus Rosano said he never registered or attended. His friend, Ellis Cropper, told ABC News that Aguilar worked at a local Dunkin Donuts where he'd just got a promotion and was planning on enrolling in college. Unthinkable: Police enter a Sears store at the Columbia Mall after Saturday's shooting . Where it happened: The shooting took place in a Zumiez skate shop similar to the one pictured here . In a hurry: A mother and daughter quickly leave the mall to safety . 'Darion . was a good kid,' he said. 'I don't know what happened ... Darion is . quiet, kept to himself. Nice, normal, calm demeanor.' The . teen lived with his mother at a rented two-story wood-frame house in a . middle-income neighborhood called Hollywood, just off U.S. Route 1. A person who attended the high school with Aguilar told The Associated Press that he was an avid skateboarder. Tydryn Scott, 19, said she was . Aguilar's lab partner in science class and described him as tall, skinny . and quiet. She said he was interested in skateboarding and hung out . with other skaters. She said she was stung by the news that he was the shooter. 'It . was really hurtful, like, wow — someone that I know, someone that I've . been in the presence of more than short amounts of time. I've seen this . guy in action before. Never upset, never sad, just quiet — just chill,' Scott said. 'If any other emotion, he was happy, laughing.'

The mystery has deepened around the Dutch 'bird man' who posted a video showing a successful 'test flight' of a wing suit contraption. No one seems to know 'Jarno Smeets'. His LinkedIn biography links to Pailton Engineering Limited, a workplace which has no record of him - and there is also no record of Smeets at Coventry University, which also appears on his CV.

The engineer's suit is made from a 200 square foot 'kite', powered by motorised wings which 'amplify' Smeets's arm movements . Smeets takes a run-up for his test flight. The 31-year-old engineer claims that he 'flew' 300 feet and stayed in the air for a minute . Smeets's invention uses accelerometers and motors to 'amplify' the flapping of his arms . Smeets' video provoked controversy . online, with many viewers claiming that it must be faked. Smeets has been very difficult to contact since he posted the video this week, and has not spoken publicly. The video . shows a flight in a park in the Hague, which lasted about a minute. Dutch engineer Smeets runs . through a park in the Hague flapping enormous, kite-like wings - and . suddenly 'lifts off', flying 300 feet through the air. Smeets . claims to be the first human being to fly like a bird, without a jet or . rotors - instead, he says he uses wings which 'amplify' his muscles, with the . motion sensors from Nintendo's Wii transferring motions into motors in . the wings. The 31-year-old engineer claims that . wireless engines in the wings work as 'amplifiers' for Smeets's own . arms, allowing him to flap wings that would otherwise be far too large . for a single human. The technology is plausible - in theory. But effects experts have called into question whether Smeets' attempt is authentic. ‘They’re able to afford to build this thing, but can’t invest in proper video equipment, or a tripod,’ Ryan Martin, technical director at George Lucas's Industrial Lights and Magic effects house said in an interview with Gizmodo. ‘If I were to make a fake video with the intention of going viral, I would make certain that the quality was as poor as possible to disguise any flaws in poor animation work. ‘I am suspicious because there is not much detail shown of the actual machine,’ he says. ‘The device is also something that is only possible in recent times, given proliferation of these types of high torque, high power density brushless motors, high voltage speed controllers and lithium batteries, off the shelf carbon fiber components and so on.' Smeets claims that the 'suit' is driven by Wii motion sensors in the arms which  'sense' the pilot's movements, helped by an . accelerometer from an HTC Wildfire S smartphone. The movements are . transferred into Turnigy motors which give Smeets the power to move the . 200 square foot wings . 'Ever since I was a little boy I have been inspired by pioneers like Otto Lilienthal, Leonardo da Vinci, said Smeets in a press release along with the video.

Russell, a pacifist and humanitarian, wrote that going to war with Germany would only see the victor inherit the bad traits of the losing side and make the world a poorer place. The letter was written by Russell in May 1937, two years before the start of World War Two and the Nazi Blitzgreig of western Europe. The two page letter is now coming up for sale at Dominic Winter Auctions in Cirencester Gloucester. Russell, who was sent to prison during the First World War for publicly lecturing against the US entering the conflict, wrote the note to a critic called Godfrey Carter. Russell, who was sent to prison during the First World War for publicly lecturing against the US entering the conflict, wrote the note to a critic called Godfrey Carter . Russell said the then Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin should dine with the leader of the German forces . He wrote from his home in Petersfield, Hampshire: 'The general argument for pacifism is that more harm is done by fighting than by submitting to injustice. 'I do not like this as an absolute principle, for example the amount of force required by the police in dealing with a burglar is not great enough to destroy civilised society. 'But an unjustified attack by one great power on another is a different matter. 'I will argue that if the Germans succeeded in sending an invading army to England we should do best to treat them as visitors, give them quarters, and invite the Commander in Chief to dine with the Prime Minister. Such behaviour would completely baffle them. Bertrand Arthur William Russell was born at Trelleck on 18th May, 1872, but by the age of three he was orphaned. His father had wished him to be brought up as an agnostic; but to avoid this he was made a ward of Court, and brought up by his grandmother. In 1890 the social critic went into residence at Trinity College, Cambridge, and after achieving a First Class with distinction in philosophy degree he was elected a fellow of his college in 1895. In 1920 Russell visited Russia to study the conditions of Bolshevism and in the autumn he lectured philosophy at the Peking university in China. The philosopher is best known for his work in mathematical logic and analytic philosophy. But he is recognized as one of the main founders of modern analytic philosophy. But he is also known for his staunch anti-nuclear protests and his campaign against western involvement in the Vietnam War. He was awarded the Order of Merit in 1949 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950. 'If, on the other hand, we fight them, we may win, or we may lose. If we lose, obviously no good as been done. 'If we win, we shall inevitably, during struggle, acquire their bad qualities, and the world, at the end, will be no better off than if we had lost.' In the event, he went on to change his view that war was the lesser of two evils if it meant stopping Hitler from taking over Europe and being a threat to democracy. Chris Albury, of Dominic Winter Auctioneers, said: 'Bertrand Russell was the most famous British philosopher of the 20th century and he wrote a history of western philosophy. 'He was totally unafraid to express his opinions however cranky they might have been. 'He had some strange ideas about society and family life and the Nazis as well. 'It is very striking to read it now and to think that such an intelligent person had such strange views. 'I don't suppose there were many intelligent people who were expressing such an opinion as his at the time. 'There was an inkling of war all through the 1930s and people like Winston Churchill had very firm views about Germany's intentions. 'However, once the war started Russell was approving of it because he thought life would be worse if the had won.'

Mexican officials broke up a bizarre cult that allegedly ran a sex-slavery ring among its followers on the U.S. border, Mexican immigration authorities revealed today. The 'Defensores de Cristo' or 'Defenders of Christ' allegedly recruited women to have sex with a Spanish man who claimed he was the reincarnation of Christ, according to an official of a victims' advocacy group. Followers were subjected to forced labor or sexual services, including prostitution, according to the National Immigration Institute that said it filed a complaint more than a year ago about the cult. (File picture) Police broke up a bizarre cult that allegedly ran a sex-slavery ring among its followers on the U.S. border . Federal police, agents of Mexico's National Immigration Institute and prosecutors raided a house earlier this week near Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Laredo, Texas, and found cult members, including children, living in filthy conditions, according to the institute official. The institute in a statement said 14 foreigners were detained in the raid and have been turned over to prosecutors, pending possible charges. Those detained include six Spaniards, and two people each from Brazil, Bolivia and Venezuela. One person from Argentina and one from Ecuador were also detained. Spain's Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed its citizens were among those arrested. The institute said 10 Mexicans were also found at the house, mainly women, and are presumably among the victims of the cult. The Attorney General's Office said the investigation was still under way as to what charges, if any, might apply in the case. Given the binds of sect loyalty that had been built over an estimated three years, prosecutors were still trying to work out which of the detainees may be considered victims, and which were abusers. The institute statement said the sect's leaders made members pay 'tithes,' with money or forced labor. The institute said in a statement that the Defenders of Christ was headed by Venezuelan citizen Jose Arenas Losanger Segovia. But according to the cult's website, the leader was Spaniard Ignacio Gonzalez de Arriba. He set up shop in Mexico about three years ago, after a stint in Brazil and other parts of South America, said Myrna Garcia, an activist with the Support Network for Cult Victims who has worked with victims of the Defenders of Christ cult. He became involved in offering courses on 'bio-programming,' an esoteric practice that claims to allow practicants to 'reprogram' their brains to eliminate pain, suffering and anxiety, according to institute. Neither Gonzalez de Arriba nor Losanger Segovia could be reached for comment on Tuesday. A number listed in an advertisement for the 'bio-programming' courses was disconnected. It was not clear if they were among those detained. The cult thrived in an area of Mexico that is tightly controlled by the violent Zetas drug cartel. The Interior Department said the Defenders of Christ had not registered as a religious group, as required under Mexican law. Garcia said cells of the cult might still be active in Peru and Argentina.","Cult was called the 'Defensores de Cristo' or 'Defenders of Christ'

In the sprawling, rough-and-tumble Sonagachi shantytown in Calcutta, India, crushing poverty is forcing thousands of girls barely into their teen years to sell their bodies for less than $2 a day. London-based photographer Souvid Datta has traveled to Sonagachi - one of Asia's largest red-light districts - to capture the young sex workers plying their trade on the dangerous streets of their filthy makeshift town. Datta, a 21-year-old Mumbai native who moved to the UK when he was 8, said in a statement that Sonagachi is effectively an illegal network run by street gangs and sex traffickers. Faces of prostitution: Photographer Souvid Datta traveled to Calcutta, India, to capture young sex workers plying their trade on the dangerous streets of the notorious Sonagachi slum . Hellscape: Situated in north Calcutta, Sonagachi is one of Asia's largest red-light district . Innocents: An estimated 12,000 girls under the age of 18 are involved in the shantytown's flourishing sex trade . Squandred potential: In Sonagachi, many girls drop out of school young and fall into prostitution while boys join street gangs to earn a living . Vicious cycle: Many of the town's girls are born and grow up in brothels, and end up following in the footsteps of their mothers . Outsiders, including reporters, are not welcome in the slum where an estimated 12,000 girls under the age of 18 are prostituting themselves to put food on the table, the site Design Taxi reported. The photographer explained that he decided to shine a spotlight on the shadowy world of the Kolkata sex trade and put a human face on the abstract concept of prostitution after witnessing years earlier a little girl being led into an alleyway by a middle-aged man. As a teenager, Datta returned to Kolkata as a volunteer for a non-governmental organization. Entering Sonagachi, Datta remembered being struck by the corruption of complicit politicians and police brass, and the daily injustices endured by the town's destitute families. Infamous: Sonagachi was the subject of the award-winning 2004 documentary Born Into Brothels . Striking memory: As a young boy visiting his grandparents in Kolkata, Datta witnessed a girl being led into an alleyway in Sonagachi by a middle-aged john . Idealistic: As a teenager, Datta returned to the shantytown as an NGO volunteer and was struck by the corruption and complicity of those in power who are unwilling to affect change . The price of a child: Datta wrote that young girls and women are effectively raped on the streets of Sonagachi in exchange for less than $2 a day . The infamous hub of prostitution and crime was also the subject of the 2004 Oscar-winning documentary Born Into Brothels, which profiled the children of prostitutes living in Sonagachi. As Datta's series of striking photographs shows, little has changed in the 10 years since the release of Ross Kauffman and Zana Briski's poignant film despite efforts by various NGOs operating in Kolkata.

The photographer has admitted that his powerful images offering an unflinching look at the lives of those unfortunate enough to call Sonagachi their home are not likely to affect immediate change or put an end to the sex trade. However, Datta continues to believe in the power of the image, and he hopes that his project will start a dialogue and spur real action by giving voice to the voiceless - the little girls with crudely painted faces who are being denied a chance to rise above their circumstances.","Sonagachi slum in Calcutta, India, is one of Asia's largest red-light districts .

Ruby Tandoh has admitted she thinks The Great British Bake Off is 'crap TV' and that women who watch it are 'silly' It is the popular TV show that turned her into a household name and saw her go from philosophy student to baking star in a matter of weeks. But Ruby Tandoh has admitted she thinks The Great British Bake Off is ‘crap TV’ and that women who watch it are ‘silly’. It is a surprising revelation for the baker, 21, who won an army of fans while Bake Off was on screens. And for a long time she was the odds-on favourite to win before being unexpectedly beaten by Frances Quinn in the final. Then of course there was Miss Tandoh’s evident passion for the programme, which saw her break down in tears almost every episode out of apparent frustration at her under baked cakes or soggy bottoms. All of that, however, seemed to go out of the window on Monday night as Miss Tandoh joined a panel of women to debate whether feminism needs a rebranding. And she launched a startlingly scathing attack on the programme. She said: ‘Collectively we’re [women in general] all a bit silly. I cried over the John Lewis Christmas advert, we like get so excited when the Starbucks red cups come out. We watch crap on TV like Bake Off. We like things we can latch onto and understand quite clearly.’ She added: ‘This isn’t about dumbing down feminism or making it more girly or softer or diluting any of these messages. And I don’t want you to compromise any of those goals. But I just think we need to change our meanings, make it more inclusive, make it less epidemic.’ It comes after Miss Tandoh surprised fans of the popular programme, which recently announced its move from BBC2 to BBC 1, by branding herself a feminist as she hit back at accusations she had flirted with co-host, baker Paul Hollywood,  and sobbed her way into the final. And as she spoke at the east London debate, which was chaired by Elle Magazine editor-in-chief Lorraine Candy, she addressed the ‘unfortunate’ stereotype that prevails about feminists as ‘angry hairy women’. She said: ‘A lot of people were surprised I identified myself as a feminist. Even though within academic feminism and journalism context, we assume feminism is the right way to go, I think we take for granted everyone feels that way. Miss Tandoh surprised fans of the popular programme by branding herself a feminist . 'Everyone doesn’t think that way. People still think that feminists are angry hairy women. That is a stereotype that prevails, unfortunately.’ As the final of Bake Off  loomed earlier this year,  fans appeared to turn on Miss Tandoh and accused her of ‘flirting’ with baking judge Paul Hollywood – something both Hollywood and Miss Tandoh have both fiercely denied. Viewers were also damningly critical of her tendency to burst into tears episode after episode. And true to form, as Miss Quinn was crowned Bake Off winner, Miss Tandoh had a little sob and was later seen in a pub where she pledged to get ‘absolutely trolleyed’ and drown her sorrows.","Ruby Tandoh has admitted she thinks The Great British Bake Off is ‘crap TV’

The lack of pressure would make the rest of your internal organs burst too, as your flesh is eaten away by temperatures of –55°C. While this is the grim scenario played out in science fiction films, scientists are just as worried about the psychological effects of life on the red planet. Elizabeth Howell, a University of North Dakota student, heard about volunteers for the project through a fellow student and decided to sign up . To find out how humans would cope, a project organised by the Mars Society has attempted to recreate the daily routine of astronauts here on Earth. More specifically, four miles from Hanksville, Utah in a high-altitude desert described as the ‘most Mars-like place on the planet’. For two weeks in January, a group of intrepid space enthusiasts donned space suits and lived in isolation, surviving on rations and showering around once every three days.

Researchers from the Mars Society live at a simulated Martian base, built with the help of space agency Nasa . The two-storey hut is situated 40 miles from Hanksville in Utah . Among them was Elizabeth Howell, a University of North Dakota student, who heard about volunteers for the project through a fellow student. Speaking to MailOnline, she describes the unusual experiment as enlightening and at times overwhelming. ‘When I was in a spacesuit I felt like I was in an outside world,’ said Ms Howell. ‘It makes you think and behave differently.’ In total, the crew was made up of seven members– two scientists, two engineers, a medical doctor, a journalist and a humanoid robot. During her two week stay, Ms Howell’s home was the Habitat Module, a two storey silo-shaped building with lab areas and living spaces, eight metres in diameter. ‘There wasn’t much personal space,’ she said. ‘There were a couple of disagreements. The suits worn by the scientists came with their own air-conditioning, radio units, heavy helmets, and boots . Boredom wasn't an issue. The crew were tasked with completing over 20 research projects over the two-week expedition, including mock medical procedures . British student was recently shortlisted for the job of repopulating the human race - on Mars. Ryan MacDonald, 20, beat more than 200,000 hopefuls to reach the final stages of selection for a one-way mission. The contest was part of the 'Mars One' project to establish a self-sustaining colony. It would see four people - two men and two women - take a five year flight into space. Mr MacDonald is now on the shortlist to join the first programme on Mars - which is 57 million miles away from Earth. The Mars One project was founded by Dutch entrepreneurs Bas Lansdorp and Arno Wielders, and aims to establish a permanent base on the planet by 2025. An initial appeal for volunteers last year gathered more than 200,000 responses. ‘Only little things, like noise in the kitchen when you have to work out what to do. We quickly found out that we need to talk about these things at the beginning.’ If an argument did occur, crew members couldn’t just step outside to cool off. Leaving the Habitat Module required a request to Mission Support a day in advance. Even then, they had to put on an unwieldy spacesuit. The suits worn by the scientists came with their own air-conditioning, radio units, heavy helmets, and boots. Although not quite like the ones that would be used on a space mission, the suits, more than anything, made crew members feel like they were on an alien planet. ‘You’d be surprised,’ said Ms Howell. ‘I actually felt like I was on another world, like I had to rely on these people. ‘I felt separated from everything else – you had this feeling that you were zeroing in on a priority.' Contact with the outside world was strictly limited, with a very slow internet connection restricted to allow just a few emails in and out each day. The Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) is one of two habitats maintained by The Mars Society. Its goals are to serve as a Mars analog environment for field operations, science and research . If an argument did occur, crew members couldn't just step outside to cool off. Leaving the Habitat Module required a request to Mission Support . This image shows the food the team eat. The experiments are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a journey . Most communication was with 'mission control', who asked the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two-week shifts. That included details on their food intake, exercise, and psychological status. Boredom, however, wasn’t an issue. The crew were tasked with completing around a dozen research projects over the two-week expedition. ‘We spent our time setting up a new radio telescope, doing simulated ‘Marswalks’ in spacesuits, and testing out protocols for medical procedures,’ said Ms Howell. Most communication was with 'mission control', who asked the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two-week shifts . While the technology to conduct these experiments on Mars is advancing, what scientists really wanted to find out was how human error factor into future designs. ‘Something I underestimated was the physical fitness needed,’ said Ms Howell. ‘We did really long walks in the desert and it does make you tired.’ ‘It teaches you a lot about resilience, because when you’re resources are limited it forces you to be more creative.’ Some scientists predict it will be 20 years before humans set foot on the planet, and there are currently hopefuls to be on that flight. Ms Howell, however, is an exception. ‘I’d only go if it wasn’t a one-way trip,’ she said. ‘I’d miss my friends and family too much.’ Nasa estimates the cost of the initial Mars landing to be £3.67billion, and every subsequent manned mission £2.45billion. The experiments being conducted in Utah and a sister station in the Arctic are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on Mars . Any crew that survives the journey will have to remain there for at least a year and a half, waiting for Mars and Earth to align properly for the trip back. During this time, they will supply their own oxygen, power, food, and water. The experiments being conducted in Utah and a sister station in the Arctic are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a trip. The shortest possible journey to Mars is 140 million miles, a trip that is thought to take around seven months. Ms Howell admits that living for two weeks on a desert where there is gravity can’t come close to recreating the environment. ‘But I learned a great deal,’ she said. ‘We need to take gradual steps before we’re ready for a mission to Mars, and this is just one of them.’ Although not quite like the ones that would be used on a space mission, the suits, more than anything, made crew members feel like they were on an alien planet .","Elizabeth Howell spent two weeks in a high-altitude desert near Hanksville .

"By . Louise Boyle . and Rachel Quigley . UPDATED: . 12:50 EST, 3 April 2013 . A survivalist suspected of burglarizing Utah cabins and evading law enforcement for years was finally arrested today, authorities said. Troy James Knapp was taken into custody in mountains outside of Ferron in central Utah, the Sanpete County Sheriff's Office said. The 45-year-old has long been suspected of being an armed and dangerous recluse who has spent more than five years breaking into dozens of mountain cabins across remote southern Utah. Trapped: 'Mountain Man' Troy James Knapp is taken into custody by the Emery County Sheriff's Office on April 2 outside of Ferron in central Utah . Tracked down: The elusive survivalist was captured by police on Tuesday after spending five years allegedly robbing cabins in the wilderness and leaving taunts for officers . Police say he's been living off the . comfort of cabins in winter and retreating to makeshift summer camps . deep in the forest with stolen guns and supplies. The last known time Knapp was spotted was on October 1 last year by a surveillance camera in Sanpete County. He had a gun slung over his shoulder and was using binoculars to scope . for an alarm system at a cabin near Gooseberry Reservoir before breaking in. Iron, Kane and Garfield counties have all issued arrest warrants for Knapp on burglary and weapons charges. Finally caught: Troy James Knapp was arrested today, left, after evading cops for years. He was last arrested in 2001, right . While there have been no violent confrontations with Knapp, authorities had feared he was a ticking time bomb. In 5th District Court in Iron County, Knapp is facing four counts of burglary, a second-degree felony; theft, a second-degree felony; and three counts of theft, a class B misdemeanor - all charges for incidents spanning June 2009 through September of 2011. He is suspected of leaving some . cabins riddled with bullet holes, defacing religious icons and writing . taunting notes for cabin owners and authorities. In custody: Snow-mobilers pass the sheriff's truck carrying the 45-year-old suspect . 'Hey Sheriff...Gonna put you in the ground!' one note said, according to court records. Records . indicate Knapp fell off the radar in 2002 when he apparently left . California in violation of his parole for a burglary conviction. He was charged with theft in 2000 in California, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in prison, according to records. Mountain mystery: A man believed to be serial burglar and expert survivalist Troy James Knapp was caught on CCTV last year in Sanpete County, Utah . Roaming: The 'mountain man' was spotted on CCTV in Sanpete County, Utah last week but once again police have failed to track down the expert survivalist . As . a teenager, Knapp was convicted in Michigan of breaking and entering, . passing bad checks and unlawful flight from authorities, according to . court records in Kalamazoo County. His . most serious arrest for felony assault in Michigan was reduced in 1994 . to a charge of malicious destruction of property after he agreed to . plead guilty. He has been compared to Davy . Crockett, the 19th century Tennessean known as 'King of . the Wild Frontier', and he remains somewhere in 1,000 sq miles of . wilderness. Knapp has family members in Moscow, Idaho, but they have not commented. One hunter, who is believed to have bumped into Knapp in June, asked him his name and was simply told: 'The Mountain'. Long search: Troy James Knapp, 44, pictured in December 2011. It is believed that he is responsible for a series of burglaries at holiday homes in the Utah wilderness . Mysterious: Investigators have found abandoned camps in the Utah wilderness, like the one pictured, dozens of guns, high-end outdoor gear stolen from the homes and rubbish strewn around the forest floor . ‘This guy is probably about as true a . survivalist as Davy Crockett,’ U.S. Marshal Michael Wingert said at the time. Comparison: Authorities say Knapp is like Davy Crockett, a 19th century survival expert portrayed by Fess Parker in the 1955 Disney film given his name . Anyone with information has been asked to contact authorities. In December 2011, photos were taken of a sandy-haired man in camouflage on snowshoes, a rifle slung over his shoulder, believed to be Knapp. It is thought that the expert woodsman has spent around seven years breaking into cabins in winter, living off hot food, . alcohol and coffee before stealing provisions and vanishing away with guns and supplies. In . February, it took detectives an entire day to reach a remote cabin . after getting a report that lights had been seen on inside overnight. It . turned out they were solar-powered lights on the porch, and the cabin . was empty - another dead-end. But their break came in January 2012 with the . fingerprint match. Early on, investigators thought his . unattended camps they came across during their search were left . behind by ‘doomsday’ believers preparing for some sort of apocalypse. This . was because of the remote locations and supplies like dozens of guns, . radios, batteries, dehydrated food and camping gear. They now have a . name, but the man remains in the mist.

They were able to lift the trophy for a few minutes before the fighting broke out, and the entire event was cancelled, along with a planned cruise down the Seine. The famous Fouquet's restaurant on the Champs Elysee closed for the evening, along with designer shops like Louis Vuitton.

What orders were given or not given to act? What did the Interior Minster do?’ Mr Didier said mass marches by families against gay marriage had been tightly policed by the Socialists in recent weeks, but the hooligans had initially been left alone. ‘Manuel Valls has gradually shown his true face: that of a partisan minister – severe with families when they have right on their side, inert with delinquents protected by the left wing culture of excuses,’ said Mr Didier.

Mr Redler said the ‘safety of Parisians was undermined by thugs who were unable to be contained by the police.’ The most stinging criticism of Mr Valls came from National Front president Marine Le Pen who spoke of the ‘welter of scum’ and ‘barbarians who have nothing to do with the fans of the football club’ and who ‘ransacked the heart of Paris’. Ms Le Pen said the government should show ‘zero tolerance’ against ‘these thugs who believe that everything is possible on our land’. Mr Valls, meanwhile, today tried to shift blame for the trouble on to PSG, saying that ‘football is sick again’, and that ‘the club had been problems controlling its supporters’.

Rich foreigners should be restricted from buying houses in Britain and purchasing newbuild homes solely as an investment, a leading think-tank has said. Wealthy overseas investors are adding to 'rampant house price inflation', driving up prices and forcing millions of middle and low UK earners out of the property market, Civitas has said. The think-tank has called on ministers to adopt a scheme to stop existing homes being sold to those from outside the EU. It also proposes foreigners should only be allowed to buy new homes if they prove their investment would lead to more properties being built. Money is no object: Businessman Roman Abramovich (left) and fashion designer Dasha Zhukova who both live in London . It would therefore stop foreign investors such as Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich from adding to his multi-million pound collection of London homes. Investment from China, Malaysia and Singapore will also be reduced under the plans, it is hoped. The report, called Finding Shelter, revealed that 85 per cent of London homes in 2012 were bought by foreign investors. Two thirds of those were bought solely as investments and were not lived in. Savills estate agent found of the £7 billion spent on top-end London properties, just 20 per cent was spent by those living in the UK last year. Civitas says foreign buyers are not just acquiring high-value London properties - but also mid-market new homes. They say 27 per cent of new builds in central London were bought by UK citizens, with more than half sold to those from Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Russia. Exclusive: A 12-bedroom mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens which was bought by Britain multi-billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal .

'It is good news for estate agents... But it is not good for those already being priced out at the bottom. It added foreign investments are 'distorting housebuilding priorities with developers disproportionately attracted to high value developments while ignoring the under supply at lower levels of the market.' The paper, co-written by director of . Civitas David Green and director of communications at the body Daniel . Bentley, added: 'London property is now seen for many in terms of its . investment potential, as a safe haven for cash in an unstable global . economic climate, rather than something that should be meeting a basic . social need for the capital's residents.

Fit for an oligarch: Roman Abramovich's house in Knightsbridge, London . 'For too many it is providing financial shelter rather than human shelter.' The restrictions are similar to a scheme currently in force in Australia, where all non-residents and holders of short-term visas  must apply to the country’s Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). They cannot purchase an existing home - but can buy a new property provided they can satisfy the FIRB that the housing stock has increased. Civitas says similar controls are used in Singapore, Switzerland and Denmark. Shadow London minister Sadiq Khan told The Observer: 'London is in the middle of a severe housing crisis, yet there are around 50,000 empty homes. A home fit for a prince: Saudi prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd was reported to be selling his luxury London mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens - known as Billionaire's Row - which is estimated to be worth £150million . 'We must stop housing that's built as family homes being used instead as a piggy bank for the world's wealthiest people.' Rather than blaming the property boom on foreign buyers, some analysts have criticised the Government's flagship Help to Buy scheme for pushing up demand in the housing market. The scheme gives people with only low deposits saved a helping hand to get on to the property ladder. They say this imbalance between demand and supply is fuelling an upward pressure on prices. Recent . Land Registry figures showed that house prices in London increased at . more than double the rate of the rest of the UK over last year.
