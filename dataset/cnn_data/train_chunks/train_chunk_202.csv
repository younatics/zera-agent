"NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (CNN)  -- Police said Tuesday night they have a Yale University employee in custody in connection with the killing of Yale student Annie Le. Authorities took Yale University employee Raymond Clark into custody late Tuesday night. A judge has issued a search warrant and a body warrant on Raymond Clark, 24,  said New Haven, Connecticut, Police Chief James Lewis at a news conference. The search warrant allows for an examination of his home, Lewis said. The body warrant allows police to collect DNA from Clark, who will be arrested if he does not comply, Lewis said. Results of DNA tests could take a day or longer, according to Lewis. Others have voluntarily given up their DNA samples, he said. Earlier Tuesday, the Yale technician's home in Middletown, Connecticut, was the scene of a large police presence. Investigators have collected about 150 pieces of evidence, reviewed about 700 hours of video and interviewed more than 150 people, some twice, Lewis said. They have yet to arrest anyone in  Le's slaying, whose body was found Sunday in a basement wall of a medical research building off campus. A senior police official that spoke with CNN disputed Yale University President Richard Levin, who had indicated that the suspect pool would be a ""limited number"" of people who had been in the basement the day Le disappeared. ""We know everyone that was in the basement ... and we passed that on to police,"" Levin said. ""There is an abundance of evidence.""  Watch latest on person in custody » . But the police official, whom CNN is not naming because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing investigation, said investigators believe dozens of people could have had access to that area of the building.

She was last seen on surveillance video as she entered the four-story lab at 10 Amistad Street, about 10 blocks from the main campus. After going over hours of tapes, authorities said they had not found images of her leaving the building.  Watch timeline leading up to Le's death » . The police official said that investigators were unlikely to make any arrest until DNA evidence is returned from analysis and that the probe could take days. Police have not released information on what DNA evidence may have been found, although investigators said earlier that bloody clothing was found hidden above tiles in a drop ceiling in another part of the building. Authorities have not described the clothes that were found, nor said to whom they might have belonged. Teams of investigators at a Connecticut State Police lab worked through the weekend processing and examining the bloodstained clothes. But Thomas Kaplan, editor in chief of the Yale Daily News, said a Yale police official told the paper that the clothes were not what Le was wearing when she entered the building. On Sunday, New Haven Police spokesman Joe Avery said that Le's killing was not a random act but would not elaborate.  Watch report on police saying killing was no random act » . Le, a graduate student in Yale's pharmacology program, was to have been married Sunday on New York's Long Island to Jonathan Widawsky, a graduate student at Columbia University. Her friend Vanessa Flores said Le was overjoyed about getting married. ""She was just so excited about this wedding and everything from, you know, her flowers to her wedding dress and just certain details about it,"" Flores told HLN's Nancy Grace. ""We talked about this back in 2008. She was already thinking about the weather, whether June, July was going to be too hot, August, so September, would it be nice?""

In February, she compared crime and safety at Yale with other Ivy League schools for a piece for B magazine, published by the medical school. Among the tips she offered: Keep a minimum amount on your person. When she walked over to the research building on September 8, she left her purse, credit cards and cell phone in her office.

"Stockholm, Sweden (CNN) -- A bomber who apparently killed himself in central Stockholm on Saturday was probably on his way to a more crowded location, but his bomb went off prematurely, Swedish authorities said Monday. He sent a warning to a Swedish news agency from his phone shortly before the explosion, chief prosecutor Thomas Lindstrand said in the first official confirmation of a link between the blast and the warning. The warning came from a man called Taimour Abdulwahab, the news agency that got the e-mail told CNN Monday. Lindstrand said authorities were almost certain that he was the bomber, but they have not yet carried out DNA testing or spoken to his family. A car exploded shortly before Abdulwahab's bomb, injuring two people; police are also linking that blast to him. No one other than Abdulwahab was killed. The Swedish Security Service said the incidents appeared to be the work of ""a single perpetrator."" He appears to have been acting alone at the time of the explosion, Lindstrand said Monday. Police believe that he had some kind of outside help in preparing the explosives, but they have no additional suspects at the moment, Lindstrand said. On Sunday, Anders Thornberg of the Swedish Security Police called the explosions ""an act of terrorism."" But he said Monday that there was no reason for the public to be worried and that Sweden was not raising its terror threat level. The two explosions occurred within minutes of each other Saturday in a district full of Christmas shoppers, Swedish authorities said. Swedish news agency TT and police said they received e-mailed threats 10 minutes before the explosions. U.S. federal agents are en route to Stockholm and are expected to assist Swedish authorities with the investigation, Security Police spokeswoman Anna-Maria Bok said. ""They are sending a team of seven bomb experts who will assist us,"" she said. ""They are experts at tracing explosives, and they have knowledge of what explosives that have been used at other attacks in the world."" FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said ""a small team of experts"" was sent after Swedish authorities requested U.S. assistance in investigating the bombings. Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt called the explosions ""completely unacceptable"" as he mounted an impassioned defense of Swedish society in the face of what seems to be its first suicide bombing. ""This is not the path we want to go down,"" he said Sunday. ""Sweden is an open society,"" Reinfeldt added. ""It is an open society which has demonstrated a will that people must be able to come from different backgrounds, believe in different gods or not believe in any god at all. Be able to live side by side, together, in our open society."" UK Prime Minister David Cameron phoned his Swedish counterpart Sunday to express his support, Reinfeldt press secretary Roberta Alenius said. ""He called him because they are close friends,"" Alenius said. ""They expressed their mutual involvement in the fight against terrorism, and they also stressed that the two countries' authorities will continue to cooperate closely in this investigation."" Regional police chief Carin Gotblad said the bomber had ""failed."" ""While this was a very serious event, no innocent people were seriously hurt. If that was the intention, then the perpetrator failed,"" she said. On Sunday night, London's Metropolitan Police searched a property in Bedfordshire, north of London, in connection with the Stockholm investigation, a spokesman said. The spokesman, who would not give his name, said that the warrant was executed under Britain's Terrorism Act 2000 and that ""no arrests have been made ... and no hazardous substances have been found."" The writer of the e-mailed threats to the Swedish news agency and police mentioned the presence of Swedish troops in Afghanistan and a Swedish cartoonist who depicted the prophet Mohammed, according to TT, a Swedish news wire that received the threats. The e-mails contained sound files featuring a person speaking in Swedish and Arabic, TT reported. About 500 Swedish troops are in Afghanistan, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force. The sender referred to Swedish silence regarding the Afghanistan troops and the controversial cartoon by Lars Vilks that depicted Mohammed as having the body of a dog. ""Now your children, daughters and sisters will die like our brothers and sisters and children are dying,"" the e-mail states, according to TT. ""Our actions will speak for themselves,"" the person said in an audio recording. ""As long as you don't end your war against Islam and the humiliation against the prophet and with your stupid support to Lars Vilks the pig."" Thornberg said over the weekend that authorities are working on both intelligence and a normal police investigation and will try to determine ""if there may be any more acts of terrorism like this one being planned. At this point, we don't think there are more acts coming, but we can't say for sure."" Qadeer Baksh, chairman of the Luton Islamic Centre, a mosque north of London, said he had a ""series of confrontations"" with Abdulwahab during the month of Ramadan in either 2006 or 2007. He said Abdulwahab was propagating an extremist message around the mosque, ""sowing the seeds of violent radicalization"" by preaching violent jihad as an obligation for every Muslim. Baksh said Abdulwahab also accused other Muslim leaders of apostasy, denouncing them as untrustworthy and claimed they were working for the government. The two men parted ways after a final confrontation, and Abdulwahab did not return to the mosque, Baksh said. CNN's Andrew Carey contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. federal agents are en route to Stockholm to assist with the investigation .

"(CNN) -- Just like those petite waifs that glide effortlessly down the Rue de Rivoli, seen at first-hand the beauty of Paris can be breathtaking. The Eiffel Tower is one of the world's most iconic buildings and is just one of the city's many highlights. Yet like those same Paris ladies who wear their hauteur like a badge of honor, the city is not without its dark side. In recent years the French capital has had its elegant facade ruffled by an explosion of discontent among the city's disenfranchised underclass. Young men -- many the offspring of North African immigrants -- angry at the lack of opportunities and perceived racism from state institutions have taken to the streets, fighting violent pitched battles with police. All this has happened in the city's ghettoized suburbs -- the banlieues. If you stay in the pristine center, you'd never know it was going on. The ugly high-rises of the unkempt banlieue are a world away from the tourists' Paris: a timeless masterpiece of tree-lined boulevards, majestic architecture and white-aproned waiters uncorking bottles of Bordeaux. The city's abundant charms give it a unique ability to bring out the romantic side of even the most world weary. Winding your way along the banks of the Seine near Notre Dame on a spring day can feel like being in beautiful day dream. Of course, you might find the illusion comes crashing down around you when you sit down at a cafe and discover the rudest man on the planet disguised as your waiter. But what would Paris be without those famously haughty Parisians, regarding you with thinly veiled contempt when you try to order ""deux billet pour le metro"" in a bad French accent? For all its classical beauty the city center is actually a fairly modern creation. The cramped and disease-ridden streets of medieval Paris were torn down in the 19th century. The work commissioned by Napolean III and supervised by the urban planner Baron Georges-Eugene Haussmann transformed the center into the city of wide boulevards and grand squares that you see today. Haussman's Paris might look like the set from a sumptuous period drama but it's not untouched by the modern. Competing for space alongside the Eiffel Tower on the Paris skyline, is the post-modern strangeness of the Pompidou Center and the sleek glass arch at La Defense. These modern creations don't get the approval of all Parisians or of the tourists, and you sometimes get the impression contemporary Paris is slightly stifled by its past -- a victim of its own beauty. Of course there's only one way to contemplate this and the many other questions the city raises. That's with a cafe au lait in hand, seated at a terrasse watching the world, and the waifs go by.","Paris remains one of the most charming and beautiful cities in the world .

"(CNN) -- The mother of missing American teen Natalee Holloway met with the man suspected in her daughter's disappearance this week at the Peruvian prison where he is being held in another woman's death, attorneys for both sides said Friday. Beth Holloway is in Peru with a Dutch documentary maker. Producers for the the Dutch journalist who is accompanying her posted a note on his website that said journalist Peter de Vries and the mother made a trip to Castro Castro prison to see suspect Joran van der Sloot. Beth Holloway's attorney, John Q. Kelly, confirmed the trip to CNN Friday saying, ""She was at Castro Castro prison and she saw Joran."" Van der Sloot's attorney, Lima Maximo Altez, also confirmed the meeting, telling CNN that it took place on Wednesday -- female visitor day at the prison. Altez said Holloway arrived with a group of Dutch journalists and asked to meet prison officials. Altez said van der Sloot was brought to the meeting ""practically by force."" Peru's ""24 Horas"" television program reported that Holloway spoke to van der Sloot for about five minutes before van der Sloot canceled the meeting because his lawyer was not present. The program reported that they spoke very little and treated each other well. According to Altez, Holloway told van der Sloot that she doesn't have any hatred in her heart towards him. Van der Sloot replied that he understood, but that he couldn't talk to her further, and handed her his attorney's business card, Altez said. Holloway has not reached out to Altez, he said. Kelly told CNN that Holloway didn't initially tell him about her planned trip to Peru until after she was already in the country. ""She just said she wanted to see Joran, she didn't give me any of the substance of what she was going to talk about,"" he told NBC's ""Today."" Kelly said he spoke to Holloway after she saw van der Sloot, but told CNN he doesn't know what she said or how long she spent with van der Sloot. ""She's been very guarded,"" he told ""Today."" De Vries said the crew did not break any rules and prison officials knew of their visit. However, Castro Castro spokesman Bruno Guzman told CNN Thursday that Holloway was never allowed inside the prison. De Vries denied media reports that prison authorities detained them and confiscated the documentary crew's gear. Kelly also shot down those reports. ""I know she definitely wasn't arrested. ... Nothing was taken from her. It was done without violating any laws or breaking any regulations,"" Kelly told ""Today."" Early Friday morning, the receptionist at the Sheraton hotel in Lima, Peru, told CNN that Holloway was in her room, where she checked in by herself. A woman in the room answered the phone in English, then immediately hung up. Kelly told ""Today"" that he doesn't believe Holloway's purpose in meeting with van der Sloot -- whom he has called a ""pathological liar"" -- was to get answers out of him. Instead, Kelly said, ""I think it was more to deliver the message that he might be in Peru but she hasn't gone away. She's determined to get answers, and you know, she wants to bring Natalee home."" Van der Sloot is imprisoned awaiting trial on a murder charge in the death of Peruvian student Stephany Flores. Flores body was found in May in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot, which the two were seen entering on surveillance camera video. He also is charged with a count of wire fraud and a count of extortion in Alabama for allegedly trying to extort more than $250,000 from Holloway's family in return for disclosing the location of her body. Natalee Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with the younger Holloway's disappearance, but was never charged. He has denied responsibility for her disappearance. In a jailhouse interview with a Dutch television station this month, van der Sloot said he is remorseful for telling so many stories regarding the disappearance of Natalee Holloway, but once again denied culpability in the case. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Ben Brumfield and In Session's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","Van der Sloot's attorney provides insight into the conversation .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday night, I hosted a town hall-style debate on guns in America, talking to lawmakers, mass shooting survivors, lawyers, gun lobbyists -- anyone, basically, who has a strong opinion about what I consider to be the single biggest issue facing America today. Since I joined CNN two years ago, there have been a series of gun-related tragedies, including the attack on U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater massacre. Each sparked a short-term debate about guns. Yet each debate fizzled out with zero action being taken to try and curb the use of deadly weapons on the streets of America. Now, following the grotesque slaughter of 20 innocent young children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, I sense that the mood has changed. We have reached a crucial moment in this debate, and I intend to use my platform to continue this conversation on Wednesday night and going forward. The media have previously been quick to move on to other stories after these tragic acts of gun violence. That must change. Opinion: Don't let this moment pass without acting on gun control . I've made my own views clear on my show -- the senseless killing has to stop. High-powered assault rifles of the type used at Aurora and Newtown belong in the military and police, not in civilian hands. High-capacity magazines, too, should be banned. And background checks on anyone buying guns in America should be comprehensive and stringently enforced. As President Barack Obama said, doing nothing is no longer an option. But, at the same time, law-abiding Americans who want to protect themselves under the Second Amendment right to bear arms must be respected. As should the rights of Americans to use guns for hunting and sport. This is a vital debate for the country. Some 12,000 people are murdered in the United States with guns every year, compared with just 35 in Britain, where there are strong gun laws. Analysis: Guns and the law . Sandy Hook should, and must, be a tipping point for real action to bring this number down. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Piers Morgan.

"(CNN) -- The Colombian military lost 13 members Saturday to an attack by FARC rebels, the country's army said in a statement. Two sergeants and 11 soldiers were killed. Another soldier was injured in the ""terrorist"" attack and is receiving medical treatment, the military said. This is the second incident in two months, reigniting tensions between the two sides, which have been in peace talks that started late last year. Last month, FARC admitted to capturing U.S. soldier Kevin Scott Sutay after he entered Colombia. Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon criticized the apparent kidnapping and called for his immediate release. Pinzon said the apparent kidnapping showed the rebel group's promises have been disingenuous in the past. ""This organization had promised not to kidnap and they kidnapped an ordinary citizen,"" he said. ""It is absurd that they continue abusing with promises that, it seems, continue to be false."" The leftist FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, has been at war with the government since the 1960s, making it the longest-running insurgency in Latin America. There have been sporadic attempts at peace since the 1980s. The last fell apart in 2002. Then-President Andres Pastrana ceded an area the size of Switzerland to FARC, but ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country in an apparent bid to strengthen their position.","Two sergeants, 11 soldiers among the dead .

"New York (CNN) -- A Brooklyn man was arrested and charged on Thursday with hate crimes after 12 mezuzahs were set ablaze as they hung on door frames outside Jews' homes. Ruben Ubiles, 34, was arrested on 17 charges, many of them hate crimes, including burglary, arson, criminal mischief and reckless endangerment, according to the New York Police Department. Police say Ubiles set fire to 11 mezuzahs inside an apartment complex in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn on Monday, which was also Holocaust Remembrance Day. A 12th mezuzah was discovered burned inside the apartment building next door a day later, police said. ""This was a brazen act of religious desecration, and it is something that is shocking to everyone in this community,"" City Councilman Stephen Levin told CNN affiliate WABC. A mezuzah is usually found attached to a door frame outside some Jews' homes. It contains specific Hebrew verses from the Torah printed on parchment, rolled up and put inside a case.

"(EW.com) -- Say what you will about the ""Twilight"" series, but you can't fault it for being inconsistent. The popular vampire franchise's final installment, ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 2,"" scored the eighth biggest opening weekend of all time with a $141.3 million debut. If Summit's estimates hold up, that's just a touch ahead of ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 1,"" which started with $138.1 million last year, and just a touch behind New Moon, which opened with $142.8 million in 2009. Impressively, ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" also earned $199.6 million in its international debut this weekend, giving it an early global total of $340.9 million. When all is said and done, the film will likely finish just above $700 million. After all, the last three Twilight films — Breaking Dawn -- Part 1, Eclipse, and New Moon — earned $712.2 million, $709.8 million, and $698.5 million, respectively. Like I said, it's a remarkably consistent franchise. That consistency may be why Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 didn't experience an expected box office boost, despite being the grand finale of the popular franchise. Other finales have earned substantially more on their opening weekends, drawing in casual viewers who want to be part of the pop culture moment. In 2011 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 opened 35 percent higher than its predecessor with $169.2 million. In 2005 Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith (which was thought to be the final Star Wars film at the time) started with 36 percent more than its predecessor with $108.4 million. But it appears that The Twilight Saga is a different beast. Fans are either in — and they've been in for a few years — or they're not interested. Fortunately for Summit (a Lionsgate company following their acquisition earlier this year), who spent about $120 million to produce Breaking Dawn -- Part 2, that cult of loyal fans is still gigantic. The film scored a blazing $34,717 per theater average from its 4,070 theaters — the best average at the entire box office. Twihards are known for rushing to the theater at the first possible moment, so Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 is expected to fall quickly from here, but with the lucrative Thanksgiving frame coming up, it should enjoy at least one more massive weekend and climb to about $300 million total. 'Breaking Dawn 2': About that 'twist'... There's still a chance that Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 could become the highest grossing Twilight film domestically — though it seems unlikely given the fact that Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 ($281.3 million) earned substantially less than Eclipse ($300.5 million). Yet, with an ""A"" CinemaScore grade from polled audiences, which were 79 percent female (hilariously, the 21 percent of the audience that was male represents the highest male ratio ever for a Twilight picture), there's a chance that repeat viewings from super-fans could boost revenues. We'll find out soon. Last weekend's champ, Skyfall, dipped 53 percent to $41.5 million in its second weekend, lifting its domestic total to $161.3 million after just ten days. The film will easily become the highest-grossing Bond film ever in the U.S. over the next few days — Quantum of Solace currently holds that distinction with $168.4 million. Around the world, Skyfall, which cost Sony and MGM $200 million, has already become the highest grossing Bond ever. After a $49.6 million international frame this weekend, its overseas total stands at $507.9 million, and its worldwide gross has reached $669.2 million — easily the highest number ever for the 50-year-old series. Casino Royale was formerly the highest grossing Bond film with $599.2 million, but Skyfall smashed that record with ease and now looks like it will soar to at least $850 million. Lincoln, Disney's much buzzed-about Oscar contender, fared well in its expansion from 11 theaters into 1,775 locations, grossing $21.0 million over the Friday-to-Sunday period. Lincoln opened slightly higher than fellow Oscar front-runner Argo, which kicked off its run with $19.8 million last month (and now has $92.0 million total). Thanks to strong reviews and an ""A"" CinemaScore grade from audiences, 64 percent of which were 50 or older, the $65 million Steven Spielberg-directed film should hold up just as well — especially because older patrons typically take their time in coming out to the theater, and the upcoming holidays frees up many working adults' schedules to go to the movies. Spielberg's last film, War Horse, which was less well-received, galloped all the way to $79.9 million over the holidays after a $7.5 million opening weekend. With awards season right around the corner, Lincoln could make it to $100 million with ease. 'Elf' on Broadway: EW review . Another Disney film came in fourth place. The videogame-themed animated effort Wreck-It Ralph dropped 45 percent to $18.3 million, and it now has $121.5 million total after three weekends. Next week, the $165 million family film goes head-to-head with Dreamworks' animated adventure Rise of the Guardians. Rounding out the Top 5 was Paramount's $31 million Denzel Washington vehicle, Flight, which descended 42 percent to $8.6 million and now has $61.3 million total. The film isn't holding up quite as strong as its great reviews — and $24.9 million debut — suggested it would. This weekend Flight added 565 theaters to its run (for 2,612 total), yet it still dropped substantially. It might not make it to $100 million, but it will be remembered as a solid hit for all parties involved. 1. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 -- $141.3 million . 2. Skyfall -- $41.5 million . 3. Lincoln -- $21.0 million . 4. Wreck-It Ralph -- $18.3 million . 5. Flight -- $8.6 million . Two films made their debuts in limited release this weekend — both to strong, if somewhat unremarkable, results. The Weinstein Co.'s Silver Linings Playbook, which has tried to present itself as both a romantic comedy and an Oscar hopeful, earned $458,000 from 16 theaters, giving it a $28,625 per theater average. Meanwhile, Focus' Joe Wright-directed period piece Anna Karenina also opened in 16 theaters, taking in an estimated $315,000, good for a $19,688 average. Those figures certainly sound strong, so what's unremarkable about them? Well, consider the fact that Lincoln garnered an $85,846 average upon its debut in 11 theaters last weekend. When the film went wide this weekend, that number dropped all the way to $11,831 — still a strong result, but a substantial dilution that naturally occurs upon expansion. Silver Linings Playbook and Anna Karenina can't afford to let their per theater averages drop by a similar ratio, and both will need to expand much more slowly and rely on terrific word-of-mouth to carry them to profitability.

"(CNN) -- General Motors is recalling nearly 250,000 sport utility vehicles because of an electrical problem that can cause fires. The recall pertains to some 2006 and 2007 Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys, Buick Raniers, the SAAB 9-7x, and Isuzu Ascenders, sold in a number of northern states, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In these vehicles, fluid may enter the driver's door module, causing corrosion that can lead to a short-circuit. ""A short may cause the power door lock and power window switches to function intermittently or become inoperative. The short may also cause overheating, which could melt components of the door module, producing odor, smoke, or a fire,"" the recall states. GM reported that at least 28 vehicle door fires were reported in connection with the problem. The recall includes a total of 249,260 vehicles that were sold in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. A solution to the problem is still being finalized, according to the recall. Owners will be notified if their vehicle is included in the recall by the respective car makers.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has been fined $70 for allegedly rear-ending an automobile in a minor four-car collision, a United States Park Police spokesman confirmed Wednesday. Scalia was not injured in the accident, which occurred Tuesday when the 75-year-old high court justice's car rear-ended another vehicle on the George Washington Memorial Parkway in suburban Virginia, according to Sgt. David Schlosser of the Park Police. The narrow and winding four-lane divided parkway travels along the Potomac River past the nation's capital, and is popular among both commuters and tourists. Scalia was driving himself to work when the accident occurred. He was charged with being at fault for the fender-bender by the investigating officer, Schlosser said. It was not known whether Scalia will pay or contest the fine. The accident didn't prevent Scalia from arriving at court on time Tuesday. Scalia was on hand when oral arguments began at 10 a.m. Tuesday in one of the biggest cases of the term, a discrimination claim by female workers against Wal-Mart Stores. The case has the potential of becoming the largest class-action lawsuit in U.S. history. No public mention was made of the accident, and Scalia, as usual, was an active questioner from the bench.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Peace talks between the United States and the Taliban over the war in Afghanistan will probably be held ""in the next few days,"" a senior U.S. administration official told CNN on Wednesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not offer up a time line for the discussions. But a prisoner exchange is one of the issues the United States intends to discuss with the Taliban. Senior U.S. officials say they want the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a soldier captured by militants in 2009. ""We have every reason to believe"" Bowe Bergdahl is alive, a Pentagon official told CNN. News that the meeting was moving forward followed a tumultuous day that saw questions raised about the peace process after an angry Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he was pulling out of the peace talks with the Taliban and canceling security talks with the United States. Karzai was angered about reports that the Taliban appeared to be offering their new office in Doha, Qatar, up as an alternative government, going so far as to put up a sign proclaiming it the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan -- the name the Taliban used during their rule. In a statement released by Karzai's office, the president said ""foreign powers"" were behind Tuesday's opening of the Taliban office. Taliban talks announced as Afghanistan assumes security . Karzai appeared to renew earlier claims that the Taliban and Western officials want to destabilize Afghanistan. Despite Karzai's decisions to pull back, the United States continues ""close coordination"" with the Afghan government on peace and security talks, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jenn Psaki said Wednesday. Karzai's office said Taliban rhetoric about continuing to take the fight to Afghan and foreign fighters, even as the group pursues a political solution, was ""completely in contradiction to the assurance that was given to Afghanistan by the United States of America."" He used similar justification for suspending security negotiations with the United States over the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan past the scheduled pullout next year. In March, Karzai appeared to accuse the United States and the Taliban of collusion, saying violent attacks by the group ""show that the Taliban are serving the foreigners and are not against them."" He later walked the remarks back, saying they were misinterpreted. Speaking Wednesday in Berlin, U.S. President Barack Obama said he wasn't surprised by Karzai's response. ""We had anticipated that at the outset there were going to be some areas of friction, to put it mildly, in getting this thing off the ground,"" Obama said. But he said that he believes Karzai remains committed to political reconciliation, and that he needs to be. ""We don't expect that it will be easy,"" Obama told reporters at a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""But we do think ultimately we're going to need to see Afghans talking to Afghans about how they can move forward and end the cycle of violence so they can start actually building their country."" At their office in Doha, Taliban make changes . Conflicting Taliban messages . The Taliban opened the Doha office with a promise to renounce international terrorism and commit to peace negotiations, conditions the United States had set before it would support establishing the office as part of peace talks. But a Taliban spokesman also said the group would continue its military campaign, a promise soon followed by the group's claim of responsibility for the death of four U.S. troops. Psaki said that the name of the Taliban office came as a surprise to U.S. officials and that Qatari officials took the name off the office door Wednesday, replacing it with the more neutral ""Political Office of the Afghan Taliban."" Karzai's office said Wednesday that his administration wants peace with the Taliban. 4 Americans killed at U.S. base in Afghanistan; Taliban claim responsibility . ""But the messages of continuation of fighting which were sent out during the opening of the Taliban office in Qatar are completely in contradiction with the peace-wanting spirit of the government of Afghanistan,"" Karzai said. He said the High Peace Council would not take part in the talks with the Taliban in Doha ""until the process is completely left to Afghans."" Karzai earlier Wednesday suspended talks with the United States over maintaining a troop presence in Afghanistan to help train Afghan forces past the scheduled 2014 pullout date for Western troops. The agreement could provide the basis for any future NATO role in Afghanistan. Karzai's decision to suspend those talks came a day after NATO-led troops transferred security responsibility to Afghan forces. The Afghan government suspended the talks ""in view of the contradiction between acts and the statements made by the United States of America in regard to the Peace Process,"" it said in a statement. Why is U.S. now brokering peace with Taliban? Hopes revived for captured soldier . Bergdahl was captured after he finished his guard shift at a combat outpost in Afghanistan's Paktika province, in the southeastern section of the county. Since his capture, four videos of the Idaho native have been released. The last video was sent in February 2011, and it's unclear where Bergdahl is being held now. He was a private at the time. The army has been giving him promotions that would have come to him had his Army career gone as planned. If he returns home safely, the Army will give him all the back pay that he has earned while in captivity. The military told CNN it had no reason to believe Bergdahl was dead. Bergdahl's family received a letter from the captive soldier recently. His father mentioned receiving the letter in an e-mail exchange with Dwight Murphy, the spokesman for the local POW/MIA group in Boise Valley, Idaho. ""We have received a letter from Bowe through the Red Cross!"" the father says in the exchange. ""He was scripted and redacted but he was no doubt alive and his faculties fully functioning as of two months ago."" He did not say when he got the letter, but Murphy copied and pasted the exchange with the father on his Facebook page after receiving his permission to do so. The father's letter goes on say, ""They are being very careful with him. He is still highly valued at high levels. ""Guantanamo, drones and politics in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Washington are still the big issues."" His father has rarely spoken to the media. In his exchange with Murphy, he said he believed ""we are getting closer to a resolution."" But, he added, there seems to be a disagreement among the Taliban about the direction forward. ""It appears at least several parties want to arbitrate captive SGT Bowe, several others ... want to keep fighting until every single Westerner is out,"" the father said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States has contacted authorities in Hong Kong to seek the extradition of Edward Snowden, the man who admitted leaking top-secret details about U.S. surveillance programs, a senior U.S. administration official said Saturday. Federal prosecutors charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in Virginia on Friday. The United States based the extradition request on the criminal complaint and a treaty between the United States and Hong Kong that covers the surrender of ""fugitive offenders"" and their extradition. Washington already asked Hong Kong, where Snowden is believed to be in hiding, to detain the former National Security Agency contract analyst on a provisional arrest warrant, The Washington Post reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials. ""If Hong Kong doesn't act soon, it will complicate our bilateral relations and raise questions about Hong Kong's commitment to the rule of law,"" the administration official said. The complaint charges Snowden with theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information, and willful communication of classified communications intelligence to an unauthorized person. The latter two allegations amount to espionage under the federal Espionage Act. Snowden, 30, has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leaking of classified documents about the NSA's surveillance programs. Those leaks were the basis of reports in Britain's Guardian newspaper and The Washington Post this month. The Guardian revealed Snowden's identify at his request. The documents revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of overseas residents. There is a question about whether the espionage charges will be considered political offenses. The U.S. agreement with Hong Kong makes an exception for political offenses, in which case the treaty would not apply to Snowden. Hong Kong Executive Council member Regina Ip said authorities can arrest Snowden if his actions qualify as a crime under Hong Kong law, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported early Sunday. But if his actions are deemed to be political charges, she told Xinhua, then Snowden will not be extradited. ""We will work under the framework of Hong Kong law, and won't allow any illegal or unfair judgment,"" Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Rimsky Yuen told Xinhua. Prominent U.S. lawyer Alan Dershowitz, a professor at Harvard Law School, said the espionage charge complicates the case. ""I think it's a dumb decision by the Justice Department to charge him with espionage,"" Dershowitz told CNN. ""That's a political crime under the extradition we have with Hong Kong. It gives Hong Kong an excuse to say we don't have to extradite him. ""They should have indicted him only for theft and conversion of property. Then Hong Kong would have to comply with the extradition treaty and turn him over."" The revelation of the leaks rocked the Obama administration and U.S. intelligence community, raising questions about secret operations of the NSA and whether the agency was infringing on American civil liberties. Obama, top legislators and national security officials defend the surveillance programs as necessary to combat terrorism and argue that some privacy must be sacrificed in a balanced approach. They say the law allows collection of metadata, such as the time and numbers of phone calls, and that a special federal court must approve accessing the content -- listening to the call itself. In interviews earlier this month, Snowden said he fled with the classified documents after taking a leave of absence from his job as an intelligence analyst for NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamiliton. The company has since fired him. A series of blog posts this week purportedly by Snowden said he leaked classified details about U.S. surveillance programs because President Barack Obama worsened ""abusive"" practices, instead of curtailing them as he promised as a candidate. However, Obama ""closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in Guantanamo, where men still sit without charge,"" a blog post said. The Guardian newspaper and website identified the author as Snowden. Snowden said that he had to get out of the United States before the leaks were published by the Guardian and The Washington Post to avoid being targeted by the government. In an interview with the South China Morning Post, he said he plans to stay in Hong Kong to fight any attempt to force him to return to the United States because he has ""faith in Hong Kong's rule of law."" The U.S. signed the extradition treaty with Hong Kong in 1996, seven months before the British colony was handed back to China. Hong Kong's extradition laws had previously been governed by the United States-United Kingdom extradition treaty. This new treaty established an agreement under what is known as ""one country, two systems"": Hong Kong has autonomy from Beijing in all matters apart from defense and foreign policy. Snowden told the South China Morning Post, in an interview published Sunday, that the U.S. government is hacking Chinese mobile phone companies to steal millions of text messages. The Guardian also reported Snowden's latest claims. Last week, Snowden told the Post that U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking computer networks around the world, including in China, for years. Melissa Gray reported and wrote from Atlanta; Dan Lothian reported from Washington. CNN's Carol Cratty, Tom Dunlavey, Steve Brusk, and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","NEW: Hong Kong authorities say they'll examine the charges against Snowden .

"(CNN) -- Every now and then, I spend time on Mars. I dig my naked toes into the fine, red-orange soil, watch how it clings to my skin -- and feel an incipient itch. The iron-rich dust is pretty alkaline. The air -- or lack of it -- also makes me itch. Pretty soon, I'll break out in what the locals call ""vacuum rose,"" as the blood boils in capillaries beneath my skin, because the air on Mars is pretty nearly a vacuum. That doesn't mean the atmosphere can't kick up a planet-girdling storm when the weather is just right. Right now, as evening approaches, the sky is a dusty pink, tending to brown-black in the east. The sun is a brilliant disk in the west, one-third smaller than I'm used to on Earth and not nearly as warming. Feathery layers of dust fan out around the lowering sun, and a few smeared-out ice-crystal clouds glint silvery gray, but the rest of the sky is clear, and the stars above stand out brighter and sharper than night on Mauna Kea. One of Mars' two moons, Phobos, or ""Panic,"" named after one of the war-god's dogs, is little more than a big, tumbling rock. The second dog or moon is Deimos, ""Terror."" Phobos is blacker than sin, blacker than soot, but still visible to my naked, freezing eye. It's cold out right now, about -40 degrees Fahrenheit. Martians call this a balmy summer evening. Tech: Internet explodes with joy over Curiosity . Of all the planets apart from Earth in our solar system, Mars is the most hospitable. Yeah. Right. Better keep my visit short. And yet, despite the discomfort, the danger, I love it here. I love coming back for these imaginary vacations. The sights are amazing. Trudging up the slope of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, you'll hardly notice the climb, it's so gradual. But by the time you've finished the 180-mile journey, you're about 14 miles higher than the datum -- what passes for sea level here. Fourteen miles. Mount Everest is about 5Â½ miles. There are no seas. But once very likely there were seas, possibly big ones. Mostly shallow, basic and even fizzy, especially around out-gassing volcanic vents, all just right for potential extremophiles. Extremophiles are life forms that adore conditions we find harsh. For them, Mars could have been heaven. And here's where the romance of Mars gets really good. I'm going back in time. ... Can't stop myself. Jonathan Swift somehow guessed the correct number of Mars' moons (two). Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli saw what he described as ""channels,"" or canali. Arizonan Percival Lowell, knowing a good PR move, then made ""canali"" into ""canals."" H.G. Wells had us invaded by octopoid, blood-drinking Martians tired of living on their old, worn-out world. Edgar Rice Burroughs upped the ante on Lowell's canals by populating the ancient red planet with gorgeous, oviparous princesses and warlike, four-armed green Martians. In a few decades, Mars heated up. News: Rover captures nearby rocket footprint . Ray Bradbury sealed the deal by making us all Martians. He sent us there; we stared into the water in the canals -- and our reflections, the faces of new Martians, stared back. But not even Ray, back when he wrote ""The Martian Chronicles,"" could have imagined how the real story might play out. The ""canals"" aren't there any more. We can't find them, don't see them. But if evidence of Martian lakes and oceans pans out, Mars might have been hospitable to life hundreds of millions of years earlier than Earth. Earth was still cooling down from its natal heat, still barraged by asteroids, and life, if it developed at all here, was probably getting the crap kicked out of it on a regular basis. Starting over again and again from scratch, or not starting at all. Until -- and this is just speculation, but it may have a foundation in fact -- until something big hit Mars and sprayed the seeds of Martian life across the gulf of space to land on Earth. Backwash. Martian spitballs. We've analyzed small meteorites knocked loose from Mars. They fell onto Antarctica, and some scientists have taken the very controversial view that there is evidence of life in them. Not proven, not certain, but ... Light Years: 5 reasons to be excited about Curiosity . My vacation on Mars could really be a homecoming. We may all be Martians. Wouldn't that be utterly cool to know? Scientists need to know. But you don't have to be a scientist to find the science of Mars compelling. Maybe an interest in genealogy will do. The challenge of getting to Mars is extreme. It's close as planets go, every now and then approaching less than 40 million miles to Earth -- but missions to Mars can spend months or years in space, depending on the economics and fuel load. Landing is tricky because aero-braking and parachutes are far less effective than in Earth's thicker atmosphere. In the 1970s, the Viking landers came down on their own rockets, but they didn't carry rovers and looked around from a fixed position. Still, they sent us our first clear pictures of Mars from the surface. Engineers like making tough jobs look impossible, sometimes. In 1997, Pathfinder bounced down, literally, within a big cluster of very tough beach balls, which then deflated and released Sojourner, a cute-as-a-bug wandering robot. In 2004, Spirit and its twin, Opportunity, both came down bouncing as well. News: Unmanned versus manned exploration . Curiosity, too large for that kind of landing, made its final descent winched from a Rube Goldberg, rocket-powered flying crane. But doubtless you know that story. The animation and videos are astonishing. And they're only going to get better. Why do we capital-N Nerds love Mars so much? Because it's beautiful, it's tough, it's buried in our mythic, childhood memories. It's covered with human triumphs but also with sad stories of failure.

"(CNN) -- Three debates down. Two weeks of campaigning to go. President Barack Obama put Republican challenger Mitt Romney on the defensive on foreign policy in the final presidential debate Monday night, with analysts and an immediate poll giving Obama the victory. With 15 days before the November 6 vote, the candidates now hit the road for the final sprint to Election Day -- focusing on the handful of vital battleground states that could decade the closely contested race. Obama kicks off his ""America Forward"" tour Tuesday with events in Florida and Ohio, where he will be joined by Vice President Joe Biden, while Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, campaign in Nevada and Colorado. In Monday's debate, Obama sought to highlight his experience after nearly four years leading the nation's military and foreign policy efforts. Romney, a former governor with less foreign policy experience, tried to paint Obama as an ineffective leader even as he expressed agreement with many of the administration's steps in Syria, Iran and other hotspots. Were your questions answered? Share your reactions to the final debate. Analysts agreed that Obama won on points, but questioned if the result would have a big impact on voters and the race as a whole. ""There's no question debate coaches would score this one for the president,"" said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King, while CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said Obama ""dominated the middle of the debate"" and emerged as the winner. Both King and Gergen agreed that Romney avoided sounding like an overzealous advocate of military action -- which is how Obama and Democrats seek to portray him. Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor, conceded Obama ""won tonight on points, no doubt about it,"" but added that Romney showed the leadership style of a commander-in-chief to demonstrate that making a change in the White House would be safe. A CNN/ORC International poll of people who watched the debate showed 48% favored Obama compared to 40% for Romney, numbers barely within the margin of error range of plus-or-minus 4.5%. Another poll by CBS scored it a clear victory for Obama. At the same time, the CNN/ORC poll showed viewers thought Romney established credibility as a leader, which former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor, said was very important. ""This isn't going to change the trajectory of the result,"" Fleischer said, noting that 24% of those questioned said the debate made them more likely to vote for Obama while 25% said it nudged them toward Romney, and 50% said they were not influence either way. The poll also reinforced a gender gap in the race, with women favoring Obama as a strong leader by 59% to 39%, while men chose Romney by 53% to 43%. Obama needs to repeat the strong support from women voters -- who comprise half the electorate -- that helped him win in 2008. The third and final face-to-face showdown occurred with the candidates running even in national polls and the race hinging on a handful of battleground states -- particularly Ohio, Florida and Virginia. According to the latest polls, Obama has a slight lead in Ohio. Romney is ahead in Florida, and Virginia is a dead heat. In the debate, Obama more than once sought to highlight Romney's lack of foreign policy experience. The president took a jab at his challenger's world view -- paying him a backhanded compliment for his analysis of the threat of terrorism to the United States. ""Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al Qaeda is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al Qaeda; you said Russia,"" Obama said, adding that ""the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years."" Romney countered that in that speech, he had argued Iran was the nation's greatest security threat and identified Russia as a ""geopolitical foe."" ""Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence,"" he said. Romney added that Obama's foreign affairs policies have made the United States less respected and more vulnerable, particularly as it relates to Iran. ""I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be,"" Romney said. Romney also repeatedly tried to shift the discussion to his strongest issue -- the continued high unemployment and slow economic recovery under Obama -- arguing that a strong foreign policy and national defense depends on a strong economy. ""We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible,"" Romney said. ""But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong. America must lead. And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home."" Romney also accused Obama of supporting policies that undermine the nation's military preparedness. ""Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917,"" the Republican nominee said, also noting that ""our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947."" Obama fired back, suggesting Romney ""maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works."" ""You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916,"" Obama said. ""Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets because the nature of our military has changed."" Sarcastically noting that the Navy now has ""these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them"" as well as ""ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines,"" Obama concluded that ""the question is not a game of 'Battleship,' where we're counting ships -- it's what are our capabilities."" How foreign policy hits close to home . Romney applauded the Obama-approved mission that killed Osama bin Laden and his efforts to take out other al Qaeda leaders but insisted that ""we can't kill our way out of this mess."" Rather, he pushed for ""a comprehensive strategy"" to curb violent extremism in the Middle East. ""The key that we're going to have to pursue is a -- is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own,"" Romney said, proposing U.S. policies to promote economic development, better education, gender equity and to help create institutions. However, he was unable to express any significant policy difference with Obama on how that would happen. Obama responded by criticizing his opponent on a host of foreign policy issues -- claiming Romney had favored positions that would have hurt the United States or offered sometimes contradictory views. ""What we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership -- not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map,"" the president said. Read the full debate transcript . Romney's economic plan seeks trillions in tax cuts while increasing defense spending, which would increase the deficit, Obama said. For his part, Romney repeatedly shifted back to his stump speech criticism of the nation's sluggish economic recovery under Obama's policies, which he says have hindered growth through high taxes and onerous regulations. The candidates were at odds as well about how Washington should ultimately respond to the continuing violence in Syria. Checking the candidates' facts on foreign policy and national security . Talking about the need to provide those fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces with arms, Romney said the Democratic incumbent has not done enough to curb violence that has left tens of thousands of people dead and also destabilized the region. ""We should be playing the leadership role,"" Romney said. That precipitated a quick response from Obama, who pointed to American efforts to organize international efforts to address the issue as well as its support for opposition factions. ""We are making sure that those we help will be our friends (in the future),"" he said. A strong performance by Romney against a lackluster Obama in the first debate October 3 in Denver helped the GOP challenger tighten the race and even pass the president in some polls. Where they stand: Candidates and issues . The president fought back to win the second debate last week in New York, according to polls and pundits, setting up Monday night's showdown at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida, moderated by CBS News Chief Washington Correspondent Bob Schieffer. Until recently, polls showed Obama ahead of the former governor on foreign relations issues, and the Romney campaign has mounted pointed attacks in an attempt to narrow the president's advantage. Other issues discussed in the debate included Iran's nuclear ambitions, China and the war in Afghanistan. Both candidates pledged to support Israel if the Jewish state comes under attack, and Romney backed the 2014 date set by Obama and NATO for withdrawing combat troops from Afghanistan. Romney has landed blows thus far in the campaign by promoting his own business background while arguing that continued high unemployment and sluggish growth showed failed policies under the president. CNN/Google Campaign Explorer: Ads, money and travel . In a major foreign policy address on October 8, Romney promoted a traditional U.S. foreign policy dating back decades, based on exerting global influence through military and economic power. While the speech sought to distinguish himself from Obama on foreign policy, specific proposals he cited then were similar to what the administration is doing. Obama's campaign has accused Romney of shifting positions on foreign policy matters and mishandling a trip to England, Israel and Poland this summer when he publicly questioned London's preparedness to host the Olympic Games and cited cultural differences as a reason for economic disparities between Israelis and Palestinians.

"Washington (CNN) -- Police arrested Indianapolis Colts safety Joe Lefeged early Saturday after allegedly finding his semiautomatic pistol poking out from under the passenger seat of the white Camaro he'd been in, police said. The Chevrolet sports car got police's attention shortly after midnight because it was being driven erratically, Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Araz Alali told CNN. According to charging papers filed in D.C. Superior Court, police spotted one of its passengers standing up in the backseat of the convertible. On the street, plainclothes officers repeatedly asked the Camaro's driver to put the car in the park. Instead, according to the charging papers, he put his foot on the gas and sped away. Four officers eventually found the Camaro, its still unidentified driver having fled on foot. They also saw one man, later identified as Lefeged, running in one direction and the man who'd been standing up in the Camaro, later identified as 23-year-old Aaron Timothy Wilson, going another way. Both men were arrested, about four miles east of the Capitol, without incident, according to Alali. Lefeged's public defender, Martina King, gave a different take, saying her client was sitting in the Camaro's passenger seat, not on foot, when he was arrested. Police at the scene searching the vehicle found a clear bottle in the center console that smelled of alcohol and a black H&K .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol ""in plain view sticking out from underneath the front passenger seat."" Investigators determined that Lefeged paid $900 for the gun, which he took possession of in late May, according to the charging papers. King, the public defender, contended the gun in question is registered to Lefeged and, since it was under his seat, was out of his reach. But Judge Anne O'Regan Keary disagreed, saying that the firearm was in Lefeged's reach if it was under his seat. Keary ruled that there was probable cause to continue detaining him at least until his next hearing Tuesday morning. According to Alali, Lefeged and Wilson were both arrested on suspicion of carrying a firearm without a license, having an unregistered firearm, having unregistered ammunition, presence of a firearm in a motor vehicle and possession of an open container of alcohol. For the time being, at least, Lefeged is facing only two charges: presence of a firearm in a motor vehicle and possession of an unregistered firearm. The 25-year-old Colts defensive back did not enter a plea during his initial court appearance in D.C. Superior Court on Saturday. Washington has some of the strictest gun-control measures in the country. According to the district's law, ""no person shall carry within the District of Columbia either openly or concealed on or about their person, a pistol, or any deadly or dangerous weapon capable of being so concealed."" That said, a firearm is permitted in the district if it is held in the registrant's home or workplace, is being used for ""lawful recreational purposes"" or ""is being transported for a lawful purpose."" Firearms registered elsewhere still must be registered in the District of Columbia. The Colts issued a statement Saturday after Lefeged's arrest, saying little more than they were ""aware of the reports"" and will not comment further until they get additional information. Lefeged has played in every game of his two-year professional football career, including four starts last season for the Colts. His arrest comes a few days after another NFL standout, former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, was charged with murder and several gun-related offenses in the death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd. CNN's Larry Lazo and Vito Maggiolo contributed to this report.","NEW: Police saw a man standing up in the convertible, charging papers say .

"Srinigar, India (CNN) -- A blaze in a historic Sufi shrine in Indian-controlled Kashmir's capital on Monday triggered widespread anger and violence. The 200-year-old shrine, a classic of Kashmir architecture, caught fire early Monday morning. The wooden shrine was quickly destroyed. Efforts by firefighters could not save the ornate structure, named for an 11th-century Iraqi saint, Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jeelani, who never visited Kashmir. The gutting of the highly revered shrine set off angry protests and clashes between police and protesters in the old city. Authorities put extra security measures in place. A police spokesman said though the shrine was damaged, the relics it contained were safe. He also confirmed that 20 people, including 10 police officers, were injured in the clashes. Several religious and separatist organizations called for a protest shutdown for Tuesday. Kashmir is having a booming tourist season. Peace has prevailed in this Himalayan region after the deadly unrest of summer 2010, which claimed 112 lives and left hundreds of others wounded.","Fire destroys revered 200-year-old Sufi shrine in Kashmir's capital .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has nominated his top counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, to be the next director of the CIA. If there is an emerging Obama doctrine to deal with the threat from al Qaeda and its allies, it is clearly a rejection of the use of conventional military forces and a growing reliance instead on the use of drones and U.S. Special Operations Forces -- and Brennan has been central to Obama's policy. In an April 30 speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, Brennan laid out the rationale for the drone policy in more detail than any administration official had done publicly hitherto. He asserted that the drone strikes are legal both under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks and because, ""There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat."" This does not appear to be the view of Ben Emmerson, U.N. special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights, who announced plans at Harvard Law School in October to launch an investigation into U.S. drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties. Politics: Compared to Hagel, reaction to Brennan nomination muted . One of Brennan's most significant legacies in the four years he has been the president's principal adviser on terrorism is the U.S. drone campaign against al Qaeda and its allies in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen -- one that has shifted focus significantly in the past year or so. On Thursday, a CIA drone strike in the South Waziristan tribal region of Pakistan killed Mullah Nazir, a leading Taliban commander. That strike garnered considerable coverage in media outlets around the world and by U.S.-based news organizations such as The New York Times and CNN. The same day a CIA drone killed three suspected Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula militants near the town of Rada'a in Yemen. There was scant media coverage of this attack. Yet Thursday's dueling strikes in Pakistan and Yemen are emblematic of a quiet and largely unheralded shift in the way that the CIA conducts its operations. The accompanying bar chart (click on it to enlarge) does a good job of representing this shift. The red bars are U.S. strikes in Pakistan, and the gold bars are U.S. strikes in Yemen based on data collected from reliable news reports by the New America Foundation. (Due to the difficulty of distinguishing between what may be a U.S. drone strike or an airstrike by the Yemeni air force, the true number of American drone attacks in Yemen could be even higher than is shown in this chart.) One possible reason for the decline of drone strikes in Pakistan is that the CIA is simply running out of targets; at least 36 militant leaders have been reported killed by drones in Pakistan since Obama took office, according to the New America Foundation data. The growing criticism of the drone program in Pakistan has also surely had some role in the Obama administration's decision to scale back the intensity of the drone campaign there. In April the Pakistani Parliament formally voted for the first time to end any kind of approval for the CIA drone program. Opinion: When are drone killings illegal? Unlike in Pakistan where political leaders have almost universally -- at least in public -- condemned the strikes, Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi said in September during an interview with the Washington Post that he personally signs off on all U.S. drone strikes in Yemen, and that they hit their targets accurately, asserting, ""The drone technologically is more advanced than the human brain."" The steadily increasing rate of drone strikes in Yemen over the past two years shows that the CIA's drone war -- rather than declining -- is shifting from one part of the world to another. Brennan has been the key architect of this policy. The Arabic-speaking Brennan, who was once CIA station chief in Saudi Arabia, in a sense became the ""case officer"" for the Yemen ""account,"" traveling to Yemen seven times since al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula sent the so-called underwear bomber to try and bring down Northwest Flight 235 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. Read more: Who's in, who's out of cabinet . How effective has the subsequent U.S. campaign against this group been? Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has not tried to launch an attack on a target in the West since its abortive attempt to bring down cargo planes bound for the United States more than two years ago, so the campaign does appear to have suppressed the group's abilities to attack overseas. According to a count by New America, at least 28 of the group's leading members have been killed in drone strikes, including the notorious American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who played an operational role in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, for instance, offering instruction to the underwear bomber. Balanced, against this is the fact that some of the popular resentment against the U.S, drone campaign that has long been the case in Pakistan is beginning to emerge in Yemen. On Friday, dozens of armed tribesmen took to the streets of Rada'a protesting the drone strike that had taken place a day earlier. One of the tribesman told Reuters that seven civilians had been killed in that drone strike. And the drone program in Yemen is also stirring some of the same controversy internationally that the strikes in Pakistan have done for many years. Human rights groups in the United States are particularly aggrieved by the targeted killing of al-Awlaki, an American citizen who was killed by a drone along with his teenage son. Gregory Johnsen, who has written an authoritative book about Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, ""The Last Refuge: Yemen, al-Qaeda, and America's War in Arabia,"" says the group has grown from around 200 fighters to more than 1,000 and that the drone campaign has helped it to recruit these new fighters. Christopher Swift, a Georgetown University academic, conducted interviews of tribal leaders in Yemen in June 2012. Swift found that it wasn't the drone campaign that had swelled the ranks of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula but rather because the group was able to offer jobs to desperately poor young men. Yemen is the poorest country in the Arab world. And drone strikes are now reportedly being considered by the Obama administration in the West African nation of Mali, where an al Qaeda affiliate has largely taken control of the north of the country, an area the size of France. Brennan has been at the center of the decisions about the use of drones in Pakistan and Yemen and their possible use in Mali, and all of this surely will be a matter of discussion during his forthcoming nomination hearings. A road map to what Brennan will likely say about drones in his nomination hearing is provided by his April speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in which he explained that drone strikes are ""ethical"" because of ""the unprecedented ability of remotely piloted aircraft to precisely target a military objective while minimizing collateral damage; one could argue that never before has there been a weapon that allows us to distinguish more effectively between an al Qaeda terrorist and innocent civilians.""

"Cairo (CNN) -- In an attempt to break through the political impasse in Egypt, U.S. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham arrived in Cairo on Monday to meet with Egypt's interim leaders. The two Republican senators are expected to meet Tuesday with interim President Adly Mansour, Defense Minister Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and interim Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy, Egyptian foreign affairs spokesman Badr Abdelatty said. They are also expected to meet separately with Muslim Brotherhood leadership. McCain and Graham are making the trip at U.S. President Barack Obama's request. ""The Egyptian military must move more aggressively toward turning over control to the civilian population, civilian organizations,"" Graham, of South Carolina, said when asked about the purpose of the trip on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. ""The military can't keep running the country. We need democratic elections. The (Muslim) Brotherhood needs to get off the streets and back into the political arena and fight your differences there, and we need to put Egypt back to work. If this continues, it's going to be a failed state. That's why we're going."" Morsy aides ordered held in Egypt . Egypt has been embroiled in chaos since the country's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsy, was toppled in a coup last month. But U.S. officials have refrained from calling the ouster a coup -- a term that could be worth $1.3 billion a year. If the U.S. formally calls the move a coup, it would have to cut off that aid. And that ""would limit our ability to have the kind of relationship we think we need with the Egyptian armed forces,"" Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said. The United States helps Egypt because it's one of only two Arab countries -- along with Jordan -- that made peace with Israel. If Washington pulls its aid, it could affect prospects for peace in the Middle East. In the last 30 years, only Israel has received more aid than Egypt from the United States. Egypt explained: 6 key questions . On Sunday, Graham said that he and Arizona's McCain had blocked a push to cut off aid to Egypt. ""I want to keep the aid flowing to Egypt,"" he said, ""but it has to be with the understanding that Egypt's going to march toward democracy, not toward a military dictatorship. And that's the message we're going to send to the Muslim Brotherhood. The only way you're going to be part of Egypt is to allow Egypt to get back to work. Stop playing politics."" The roots of chaos . Clashes between opposing protesters or between protesters and Egyptian security forces have left hundreds of Egyptians dead in recent weeks. Morsy supporters have camped out for weeks in crowded Cairo streets, demanding Morsy be reinstated. Meanwhile, secularists and liberals -- whose protests led to Morsy's ouster -- have started supporting the current military-backed government. Morsy became Egypt's first democratically elected president in June 2012, after popular protests forced the resignation of Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled the country for 30 years. But a year into Morsy's term, many Egyptians wanted him out, too. They said the Western-educated Islamist -- and former head of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party -- had not been inclusive since taking office. Critics said he failed to deliver on the people's aspirations for freedom and social justice. But Muslim Brotherhood spokeswoman Mona al Qazzaz accused the military and opposition of ""killing the biggest democracy in the Middle East."" ""The military stepped in, and the opposition that failed to win through the ballot boxes came on the back of the tanks,"" she said. Egyptian minister meets with U.S., EU diplomats about violence .

"(CNN) -- Hosts Brazil claimed top spot in Group A at the troubled Confederations Cup with 4-2 win over Italy in Salvador Saturday. The match may have lacked the quality of previous classic encounters between the world football heavyweights, but burst into life in the second half. Dante had given Brazil the lead before the break, but it needed a double from Fred and a classic free kick from home talisman Neymar to see off a determined Italian challenge. Victory also meant Brazil will likely avoid world champions Spain in next week's semifinals. Spain currently top Group B ahead of the final round of matches Sunday and have been in commanding form, beating minnows Tahiti 10-0 in their latest match. Brazil have also impressed with comfortable wins over Mexico and Japan, but this has gone almost unnoticed because of the mass popular protests outside games and across the country. Demonstrators have taken to the streets to highlight the cost of Brazil hosting next year's World Cup and the 2016 Olympics against a background of sub standard public services and corruption. The other match Saturday in Group A in the southeastern city of Belo Horizonte, between Japan and Mexico, saw a massive rally in the streets near the Mineirao Stadium. Police fired tear gas to attempt to disperse protesters, who had gathered despite a televised appearance late Friday by President Dilma Rousseff, who had promised changes. Mexico beat Japan 2-1 after two goals by Manchester United's Javier Hernandez. Before the match in Salvador at the Arena Fonte Nova, Italy coach Cesar Prandelli had advised his squad to stay inside their hotel because of security fears, but only limited protests were reported there. Neymar proved a thorn in Italy's side from the start and was behind a flurry of attacks in the first minute. But the rest of the half proved scrappy until the home breakthrough in added time. Neymar whipped in a free kick and after Fred's header was palmed clear by Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, Dante pounced to slot home the rebound. Italy surprisingly equalized in the 51st minute as Mario Balotelli cleverly flicked on a long ball with a backheel and Emanuele Giaccherini charged forward to score. But parity lasted just four minutes, Neymar winning a free kick on the edge of the area and stepping up to beat Buffon with a precise strike. It was the Barcelona-bound star's 23rd goal for Brazil and sixth in his last seven games, continuing his superb form at the Confederations Cup. Balotelli had a penalty appeal denied before Fred showed his strength to thump home the third in the 66th minute. Shortly afterwards, Neymar, who has scored three goals in the competition, was substituted by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, rested ahead of a last four clash in Belo Horizonte next Wednesday. But it looked an unwise move as Italy pulled one back as Giorgio Chiellini scored with a low shot after Brazil failed to clear a corner. Christian Maggio thumped the woodwork as Italy pushed for an equalizer but were finally defeated when Fred converted after Buffon could only push out Marcelo's shot into his path. ""We beat a strong Italian team and I think this shows we are on the right road, even if there are a few things we need to improve,"" Scolari told AFP.","Brazil beat Italy 4-2 in their final Group A Confederations Cup game .

"(CNN) -- Oil companies could soon be using an innovative new technique involving nanotechnology and magnets to help clean up offshore oil spills. Oil spills from container ships or offshore platforms are a frequent hazard to marine and coastal ecosystems and an expensive one to clean up. BP expects the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 -- the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history -- to cost it $40 billion. However, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) say they have found a method of recovering oil after a spill using magnets, potentially saving companies like BP money in clean up bills. On it's own, oil is not magnetic, but MIT researchers say that when mixed with water-repellent nanoparticles that contain iron, the oil can be magnetically separated from the water. The nanoparticles can later be removed to enable the re-use of the oil. ""I had known about other scientists using magnetic fluids to separate oil but it had never worked out practically and that was something I felt I could do something about,"" says co-researcher Markus Zahn. The recovery process would be conducted out at sea after the oil spill, explains Zahn. Seawater polluted with oil would be pumped onto a boat treatment facility. Once onboard, the magnetic nanoparticles would be added and attach themselves to the oil. See also: A robot that detects oil spills . The liquid would then be filtered with the magnets to separate the oil and water, with the water returned to the sea and the oil carried back to shore to an oil refinery. ""I think in the world we are in, there are always going to be spillages which affect the wildlife and livelihoods of people and this can help tackle that,"" says Zahn. Since the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, there has been a rise in interest from oil companies and government departments in funding new techniques for reducing the environmental impact and cost of future oil spills. Until now the two main methods have been using chemical dispersants, which break up the oil, and skimming, a technique whereby the oil is pulled off the surface of the water. Although there are drawbacks to both -- chemical dispersants can have negative impacts on marine life and skimming can be hampered by bad weather -- magnetic techniques may still find it difficult to gain acceptance. Zahn admits that one oil company has already turned down the opportunity of funding the research but is confident that other companies will support the project. The use of tiny nanoparticles is seen by some as controversial. As well as being complex and difficult to use on a large-scale, there are concerns they could damage marine life, if accidentally released. See also: Robotic sailboats built to clean up oil spills . While their impact on the environment is still largely unknown, scientists such as David Andrews from the U.S.-based Environmental Working Group (EWG), say their use should be limited. Others suggest the magnetic technique would be better suited to small-scale use and that existing alternatives such as skimming are still better suited for tackling large-scale offshore oil spills. ""On a small-scale it (the magnetic technique) may be an excellent system but I don't think it will work at sea in such a challenging environment,"" says Dr Susan Shaw, founder of the Marine Environmental Research Institute. ""I think ultimately, it may be a better way of recovering oil once it is brought ashore rather than out at sea."" For Shaw, a newly developed skimmer from an Illinois company Team Elastic offers a better method for cleaning up oil spills. It can recover about 4,700 gallons per minute, so assuming the skimmer could be deployed 24 hours a day, it would take 30 days to pick up the entire 200 million gallons of oil spilled during the Gulf of Mexico disaster. ""In my opinion, the new skimmers are the most hopeful and best method for cleaning up an oil spill and protecting health and the environment. They should be part of the safety equipment required by permit for every offshore drilling rig,"" says Shaw.","MIT researchers develop new technique for recovering oil using magnets .

"(CNN) -- Fresh off the news that it's reached a huge milestone -- 1 billion users -- Facebook on Thursday rolled out a video comparing the social network to other things that bring people together. Like airplanes. And bridges. And chairs. Yep ... chairs. The video, posted by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook brass on their pages, came as the site announced it had reached 1 billion accounts that are active at least once a month. It took the social media juggernaut six years to hit 500 million and only another two to double that. Zuckerberg said the video, titled ""The Things That Connect Us,"" is the first time Facebook has ever created a ""brand video"" and that it is designed ""to express what our place is on this Earth."" ""We believe that the need to open up and connect is what makes us human,"" he wrote. ""It's what brings us together. It's what brings meaning to our lives."" The 90-second video takes the unlikely tack of comparing the site, famously birthed in Zuckerberg's Harvard dorm room, to everyday items. It begins with the image of a red chair levitating in a forest, but quickly moves on to show other chairs being used as children play and adults rest, dance and chat. ""Chairs are made so that people can sit down and take a break,"" the narrator says over a stirring musical arrangement. ""Anyone can sit on a chair. And if the chair's large enough, they can sit down together and tell jokes, or make up stories or just listen."" Doorbells, airplanes and bridges ""are things people use to get together so they can open up and connect about ideas and music and other things people share,"" the narrator continues. In a universe that can make us feel alone, ""maybe the reason we make all these things is to remind ourselves that we are not,"" the video concludes. Marketing analysis site Ad Age reported that Facebook doesn't plan to air the ad on television, instead using it on its own advertising platforms and a website that anyone can visit. While it's a celebration of the milestone, Facebook also clearly hopes the ad will help attract its next billion users. Facebook plans to advertise in 13 markets -- the U.S., UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Mexico, Brazil, India, Philippines, Indonesia, Japan and Russia. ""We're creating this for our users, but we think it's a message that will be interesting and relevant to non-users as well,"" Rebecca Van Dyck, Facebook's head of consumer marketing, told the site. ""We feel like we need to be respectful and introduce ourselves and to say 'This is what we believe in' and 'Come on board.' ""","Facebook celebrates 1 billion users with new video .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court displayed some discomfort on Wednesday as it tried to resolve a testy international custody fight. Deep divisions were apparent from the bench, as the justices tried to sort out competing allegations raised by the parents and proper legal remedies. At issue is whether an appeal of an American judge's order allowing a child to go back to Scotland with the mother becomes moot under the terms of an international treaty since the child is no longer in the United States. Lynne Chafin and her lawyers say the purpose of the Hague Convention treaty was to stop children like her 5-year-old daughter, Eris, from bouncing back and forth between countries over custody. But the girl's father, Jeffrey Chafin, says the custody fight began in American courts where the girl was living at the time, and that his legal claims were never fully heard in those federal courts. A majority on the high court appeared to offer some level of support to the father's legal position, during a tense hour of oral arguments. The word ""unfortunate"" was mentioned several times by the justices over the entire ""he-said, she-said"" parental disagreements. ""The incentives if you prevail are for the custodial, or the parent with control over the child, to leave immediately,"" Chief Justice John Roberts told the mother's lawyer. ""Even after a motion for a stay has been filed. Get on the first plane out and then you're home free. That seems to me to be a very unfortunate result."" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said to the father's lawyer that the purpose of the international treaty was to eliminate ""shuttling of children"" across courts in different nations, a process she said could take years. An eventual ruling in the case of Chafin v. Chafin could establish an important precedent on the discretion of U.S. courts to decide where children caught in custody fights should stay. In the middle of this case is Eris, who now resides in a remote part of the United Kingdom with her mother. Army Sgt. Jeff Chafin is based at Ft. Stewart, Georgia. He claims she is an unfit mother. She was once arrested for disorderly conduct after a night of drinking and was deported for overstaying her visa. She claims he is manipulative. Back in her home country without her daughter, Lynne filed a ""Petition for Return of Child to Scotland"" under the 1980 Hague Convention's Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. It grants parents in general a ""right of custody"" and a separate ""right of access,"" ensuring the laws of one country are respected in the others. More than 80 nations are a party to the treaty, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Lynne did not see her daughter for 10 months while the custody case played in a federal court in Alabama. Just hours after a federal judge allowed Lynne to take the child to Scotland, the two were on an overseas flight. A federal appeals court later said the matter was out of its hands since the child was now in another country, ruling the issue was moot. Both sides disagree on whether the father moved quickly enough to appeal the immediate removal order in an appropriate court. Now the justices will decide the jurisdictional questions. Michael Manely, the father's attorney, told the justices that the issue was not moot and that the child should be brought back to the United States while courts here resolve the matter. ""When you say bring the child back, there's an impediment to that because now this court in Scotland has told her don't-- the child stays here,"" said Ginsburg. ""There's an order that the child not be removed from Scotland."" Tougher questions were aimed at Stephen Cullen, attorney for Lynne Chafin, who said ""once the doors close on that plane and that child arrives back in Scotland, unless the plane turns round and comes back again, it is all over"" on any appeals. ""You're not going to suggest all those countries that permit appeals explicitly and stop removals until appeals are finished, that those contracting treaty parties are breaching the convention, are you?"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor skeptically. Roberts -- the only justice with young children -- suggested the father was not given a proper time or opportunity to appeal once the initial removal order was signed by the federal judge in Alabama. ""It seems to me,"" he said, ""the best thing is to hold things up briefly, so that the child doesn't go overseas and then have to be brought back, particularly if you have situations where there can be an expeditious appeal. And I think most appellate courts would appreciate the benefit of that."" Justice Stephen Breyer said just because the child is in Scotland, does not mean federal courts in the United States still have no role to play. ""I don't understand why you want a treaty where the best interests of the child are what's at issue, and then you interpret it in a way that the court of one nation with the child where you have parents from both nations pays no attention at all to what courts in other nations are saying."" Jeff Chafin was in the courtroom for the morning arguments, dressed in his Army dress uniform. ""I told my little girl I would do everything I could to get her,"" Sgt. Chafin told CNN National Correspondent Joe Johns this week, ""to make sure she's safe."" He last visited the girl overseas a few weeks ago. ""I don't believe that (the current legal fight) is in the best interest of the child as it's going to go on for years and years to come,"" Lynne Hales Chafin told CNN. A ruling is due in a few months. The case is Chafin v. Chafin (11-1347).","Case involves girl living with mother in Scotland; husband is in U.S.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Taliban said its gunmen opened fire on an aid group's vehicle in eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday, killing four International Rescue Committee workers and prompting the organization to suspend its operations. Three IRC female staffers -- a British-Canadian, a Canadian, and a Trinidadian-American -- were killed, as well as an Afghan driver who also worked for the New York-based aid group, the IRC said in a statement. Another Afghan driver was critically wounded in the attack in Logar province, south of Kabul, IRC said. ""They were traveling to Kabul in a clearly marked International Rescue Committee vehicle when they came under fire,"" according to the statement. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. The aid workers were in a two-car convoy when gunmen opened fire on them in Pul-i-Alam, the capital of Logar, according to provincial governor Abdullah Wardak. IRC, which provides relief to refugees and victims of armed conflict around the world, said it ""has suspended its humanitarian aid programs in Afghanistan indefinitely."" ""We are stunned and profoundly saddened by this tragic loss,"" said IRC president George Rupp. ""These extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of Afghanistan, especially the children who have seen so much strife. Words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in Afghanistan."" Earlier this month, aid groups in Afghanistan issued a report that said 19 of their workers have been killed in the country this year. The deaths Wednesday add to the count. The groups, in a report issued by the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief, said the attacks have forced them to scale back on relief work. ""This year there have been over 84 such incidents, including 21 in June, more than in any other month in the last six years,"" the report said. ""So far this year 19 NGO (non-governmental organization) staff have been killed, which already exceeds the total number of NGO workers killed last year.""","Gunmen shoot and kill four international aid workers and driver near Kabul .

"(CNN) -- In the latest round of fighting between Israelis and the Palestinian militants of Hamas in Gaza, one key player looms like an ominous, lengthening shadow: Iran. Never far from sight or mind, the standoff between Iran and the West over Iran's nuclear program serves as the backdrop to the fighting. It frames Israeli tactics and strategy and influences the international diplomatic response. Iran and its nuclear program also play a powerful psychological role, as observers and participants ponder the parallels between the latest Israel-Hamas conflict and a possible war in which Iran would stand against the U.S. or Israel, and perhaps other NATO allies. Cease-fire reached in Gaza conflict . Little wonder then that Israel has received strong support from U.S. President Barack Obama -- who has repeatedly stated, ""We are fully supportive of Israel's right to defend itself from missiles raining on people's homes"" -- as well as from nations including the UK, Germany, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands and others. When Israelis see a rocket launched from Gaza, the thought that one day that rocket could carry nuclear materials burns hot in their mind. Opinion: Israel, engage Abbas now . And when they see their Iron Dome defensive missile shield -- the extraordinarily successful new technology -- shoot down a missile, it gives them, and perhaps NATO, a sense of reassurance about how a clash with Iran might unfold. Tehran has long armed Israel's most determined enemies. Israelis worry that Iran could hand nuclear materials to groups committed to Israel's destruction, a prospect many see as more realistic than a direct nuclear attack from Iran. Israel's attacks in Gaza are aimed at stopping the rockets and mortar attacks that have gone on for years and have intensified greatly in recent weeks. Israel complained to the U.N. But Israel also wanted to deplete a Hamas arsenal it sees as part of Iran's preparations in case of war with Israel. Israeli officials say the missiles launched by Hamas and Islamic Jihad into Israel's two largest cities, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, are Iran's rockets, which Israelis believe were shipped by Iran in separate pieces like a doomsday Ikea package. They were sent by sea to Sudan and then moved through Egypt and into tunnels to Gaza, where they were assembled for firing at Israel with the help of Iranian operatives on the ground in Gaza. Iran and Sudan have denied that such a smuggling operation exists. Iran has threatened to unleash attacks against Israel and ""wipe it off the face of the Earth,"" in case of a hit on its nuclear installations. Those attacks could come from Gaza and from Iran's Lebanese ally, Hezbollah. Perhaps not coincidentally, in late October Israeli fighter jets are believed to have bombed an arms factory in Sudan. The Times of London said the facility made missiles for Hamas and was operated by Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Some analysts have speculated that the Israeli attacks against Gaza constitute the second part of the Sudan operation, in which Israel set out to destroy Iran's most dangerous weapons arrayed in Gaza just meters from Israeli civilian populations and being launched with increasing brazenness by Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Opinion: How this could be the last Gaza war . The latest fighting brings to the forefront one of the pivotal questions posed by the revolutions that swept across the Arab Middle East in the past two years: Where would key Arab and Muslim players stand in case of a confrontation between Iran and the West, particularly if Israel and the Palestinians became one of the epicenters of fighting? European governments that defended Israel's right to fight back against rocket attacks also urged restraint, fearing an unraveling of a highly unstable Middle East, where alliances are shifting and agendas are difficult to ascertain. One of the great uncertainties of the latest conflict has been how Arab countries where the political ground has shifted -- particularly Egypt -- would react. So far, it appears that the rhetoric has changed somewhat. Arab leaders and their populations support the Palestinians, but they have other priorities at home. In case of a war with Iran, however, specifically one involving Israel, what would Turkey, a NATO member but withering critic of Israel, do? What could the West expect from Egypt, with its president's Muslim Brotherhood ties? What about Qatar, a strong backer of Hamas but an important U.S. friend in the region? The political transformations brought by the Arab uprisings also shattered some of Hamas' alliances, particularly the one with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iran's best friend and until recently Hamas' own warmly hospitable host. Damascus provided Hamas' home away from home, the base of its exiled politburo leaders. When the carnage in Syria spun out of control, Hamas broke with al-Assad and its leaders left, but the group maintained its links with Tehran. Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya traveled to Iran earlier this year, reaffirming ties with the Islamic Republic. And although Hamas and Iran stand on opposite sides of Islam's Sunni-Shia divide, they share fundamental goals. Tehran's leaders unambiguously call for an end to Israel. Hamas has even more explicit goals on the issue. Its charter, which has never been revoked or amended, opposes any negotiations with Israel and declares ""Israel will exist ... until Islam will obliterate it."" The charter also quotes an ancient Islamic scripture about the promise of redemption, saying it will come after ""killing the Jews."" While Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal has made some conciliatory statements, suggesting a temporary accommodation with Israel might be possible, he has announced plans to retire, and hardliners led by Haniya are gaining the upper hand in a power struggle within Hamas. It's not much of a stretch to say Hamas and Iran share the same objectives regarding Israel and the desirability of a future without it. Opinion: Israel, face new reality . The fighting between Israel and Gaza falls tragically on the people who live there. But, like much that goes on in the Middle East, it has much larger geopolitical implications, casting shadows across the world and buffeted by forces beyond the immediate site of the fighting. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: In the latest Israel-Hamas conflict, Iran is a key player .

"(CNN) -- Anthony Stokes, 15, received a heart transplant Tuesday night at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, according to a family spokesman. Anthony is recovering and ""doing great,"" Mark Bell said. Anthony's case first attracted national attention when his family told media the hospital had denied him a spot on the heart transplant list. An August 7 letter from the hospital, which Bell provided to CNN, said that ""Anthony is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of noncompliance, which is one of our center's contraindications to listing for heart transplant."" Noncompliance generally means that doctors doubt that a patient will take his medicine or go to follow-up appointments. A week later, according to Bell, doctors reversed that decision and gave Anthony top priority on the transplant list. On August 16, Anthony had a procedure to insert a device to support his failing heart, Bell said. The ventricular assist device, or VAD, was used to help the heart function and blood flow while he waited for the heart transplant. The mechanical pump included a small tube that carried blood out of the heart into a pump, and another tube that carried blood from the pump to blood vessels. Vessels deliver blood to the body. Bell said Anthony's heart transplant started at 6:15 p.m. on Tuesday and lasted just over five hours. The teen has been in the hospital since July 14, according to CNN affiliate WSB-TV. Children's Healthcare of Atlanta has been mum on Anthony's case, citing patient privacy. Last week a hospital spokeswoman declined to confirm Anthony's VAD procedure and referred CNN to the family for related inquiries. The hospital is in good standing, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, the nonprofit organization in charge of transplant coordination in the United States. ""Children's Healthcare of Atlanta has performed 10 transplants so far this year; three of them in the past week alone,"" the hospital said in a statement Wednesday. ""Since our transplant program's inception, we have performed 279 pediatric heart transplants on children ages ranging from newborn to 21."" A matter of compliance . Assessing compliance for potential transplant recipients is important because if a patient doesn't strictly take all required medicines as directed, he or she could die within weeks of leaving the hospital, said Dr. Ryan Davies, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware, who is not involved with this case. But Bell said a doctor told the family that Anthony's low grades and time spent in juvenile detention factored into that assessment. ""The doctor made the decision that he wasn't a good candidate because of that,"" Bell said. ""I guess he didn't think Anthony was going to be a productive citizen."" Anthony's mother, Melencia Hamilton, told CNN affiliate WGCL-TV that doctors said Anthony would have lived only three to six months if he hadn't gotten the heart transplant. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Georgia chapter was involved in drawing media attention to Anthony's case because the organization has ""a longtime relationship with the child,"" said the Rev. Samuel Mosteller, the chapter's president, . Mosteller said Anthony was judged based on ""tattoos and an ankle bracelet"" from a ""juvenile agency."" Bell said the detention was because Anthony got into ""an altercation to protect his younger brother."" Anthony had no health problems before this summer, Bell said; the heart problem is not congenital. But he started to have trouble sleeping and then complained about his chest hurting. His mother took him to the hospital because of the chest pains. Bell said the family didn't press the doctor on what led to overturning the decision regarding the transplant list. Personally, Bell attributes it to ""the handiwork of God and the media pressure."" The hospital did not comment on what led to doctors' change of heart. The complexity of transplants . Federal records show that 3,400 people were on waiting lists for heart transplants in 2012, but only 2,000 of these procedures were performed. While waiting for a heart transplant, 331 people died. Dr. David Weill, medical director of Stanford University's Lung and Heart-Lung Transplant Program, said it's not unusual for patients to be rejected from organ transplant lists because of noncompliance -- in other words, if they are seen as people who won't follow instructions about taking medications and seeing doctors. At Stanford, Weill's group evaluates about 300 patients per year for lung transplants and turns down about 1% to 2% because of noncompliance. It's about the same for heart transplants, as well, he said. As part of the evaluation process, organ transplant patients undergo a complete psychosocial evaluation so doctors can get a sense of whether they and their families will follow through with a complicated medical regimen, Weill said. ""A few times a year, we run into people who can't,"" he said. A patient would not be turned down solely for having served prison time or having bad grades, Weill said, but ""we would want to look at the entire picture."" Some patients have been denied because they don't have anyone in their lives who can take care of them and accompany them to appointments. After a heart transplant, patients are too sick to do these things alone, Weill said. ""When we fear that someone's not going to do well, it's because the patient couldn't comply with the regimen or they don't have any support in their life,"" he said. Psychosocial factors don't change a person's priority on the waiting list, but they could lead a person to be denied a spot on that list, he said. Arthur Caplan, head of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, noted that patients have to adhere to a lifelong regimen after receiving an organ transplant -- showing up at medical appointments, taking medications, monitoring changes in health -- and teenagers in general don't have a good track record of following orders. Teenagers aren't automatically ruled out for heart transplants, but ""the consequence that 'you are going to die if you don't take these medicines' is far from the mind of a 17-year-old,"" said Davies, the cardiothoracic surgeon. Caplan said Anthony should be counseled and worked with intensively so he understands what's expected post-transplant.","Anthony Stokes had heart transplant on Tuesday night, family spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- A fast-moving California wildfire that is threatening thousands of structures has roughly doubled in size in a day -- to about 165 square miles -- and is now burning in part of Yosemite National Park, officials said Friday. The Rim Fire has burned nearly 106,000 acres, up from about 53,000 acres a day earlier, spreading east from Stanislaus National Forest to part of Yosemite, Forest Service spokesman Bjorn Fredrickson said. The fire is only 2% contained. The fire has burned 11,000 acres in a remote wilderness area of Yosemite and has had no direct effect on the park's tourist-heavy Yosemite Valley, park Ranger Kari Cobb said. Although smoke could become an issue in parts of the park, Yosemite Valley -- 20 miles away -- was clear Friday morning because winds were pushing the smoke and fire away, she said. ""(The fire) is in an area that would not affect park operations,"" she said. Meanwhile, the fire also is spreading west, threatening the small mountain communities of Groveland and Pine Mountain Lake just outside the Stanislaus forest. KOVR: Rime Fire Burns 105,000 acres . About 4,500 structures are under threat, according to InciWeb, a federal website that collects information from agencies like the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. Part of the Groveland area is under an evacuation order. ""It's crazy, and it has been for five days,"" Kirsten Lennon, whose home is threatened, told CNN affiliate KCRA. ""Your heart's racing a little faster."" KTXL: Rim Fire expands to 165 square miles . The fire still hasn't touched Groveland, which is about 120 miles east of San Francisco. Firefighters have kept the flames from pushing into the small mountain town, Fredrickson said Friday. Meanwhile, about 70 miles to the east of Groveland, evacuation advisories were issued Friday for the town of Tuolumne and nearby Ponderosa Hill by the Tolumne County Sheriff's Department, according to InciWeb. It was not clear how many residents were covered by the evacuation advisory. Authorities say the Rim Fire started in Stanislaus National Forest, just west of Yosemite, on Saturday afternoon. The largely inaccessible and steep terrain has hampered firefighters' efforts, according to InciWeb, helping the fire grow nearly unchecked to a size now 1.5 times the area of California's capital, Sacramento. More than 1,800 firefighters have been battling the flames on the ground and by aircraft. The cause of the fire is under investigation. The fire had destroyed 16 structures as of Friday morning, according to InciWeb. The locations of those structures weren't listed. California Gov. Jerry Brown declared an emergency in Tuolumne County on Thursday, when the fire's size was reported to be only about 53,000 acres. KXTV: Rim Fire rages . The fire's immediate impact on Yosemite included the continued closure of Highway 120, resulting in a half-hour detour for visitors trying to enter the park from the west. In Yosemite, the fire was about 4 miles west of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, near Lake Eleanor, Cobb said. Those areas were evacuated earlier in the week as a precaution, though no visitor or ranger structures are in danger, she said. ""Visitors who have planned to come this weekend should still come. Yosemite Valley is not affected by the fire,"" Cobb said. Yosemite, with hundreds of campground sites and lodging units, had nearly 4 million visitors last year, according to the National Park Service.","Rim Fire isn't affecting popular Yosemite Valley area of park, spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- It cost more than $380,000 to develop -- and doesn't come with French fries on the side. But the world's first test-tube burger -- grown in a laboratory from a cow's stem cells -- will be served in London next week. Read more: Tiny hooks revolutionize concrete . The burger, made from 20,000 strips of cultured meat mixed together with lab-grown animal fat, took nine weeks to grow and cost Â£250,000 ($384,000) to develop. The scientist behind the project hopes that laboratory-grown meat could provide a solution to the problem of increasing global demand for meat and protein. Mark Post, from the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands, spent two years researching the initiative. ""There's no doubt it would be revolutionary in the way we produce staple food,"" he said. Read more: British inventors claim world's first flying bicycle . It takes eight to nine weeks to produce just one stem cell burger. ""It depends how much resources are put into the production of cultured meat. It will always take this long for cells to multiply, but we could produce a million burgers in this time if enough resources were being spent on the production,"" he said. According to the World Health Organization, demand for meat is going to double during the next 40 years but current production methods are not sustainable. Post said the production of synthetic meat would also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and help address animal welfare problems. Read more: A teen builds one-man submarine for $2,000 . Scientists believe artificial meat could be sold in supermarkets within five to 10 years. ""The emphasis is on could,"" Post cautioned. ""Five years might be too early and 10 years sounds more realistic, if we spend a lot of resources on pushing the production of cultured meat forward."" His research into synthetic meat has been funded by the Dutch government, as well as an anonymous donation of â‚¬300,000 ($396,000). The burger will be cooked and eaten in London next week at a yet undisclosed location in front of an audience. ""The whole presentation next week will be a proof of concept,"" Post said. Of course we're not there yet to make it an efficient and cheap product. But I want to show that it can be done so that people see: ""Yes you can eat it, yes, it tastes good.'""","The world's first test-tube burger will be served in London next week .

"(CNN) -- A University of Louisville football player who suffered a broken neck while making a tackle showed no signs of paralysis hours later, team officials said Saturday. Cornerback Anthony Conner suffered the injury during a collision with Rutgers University receiver Mohamed Sanu in the second quarter of Friday night's game in Louisville, Kentucky. ""Our doctors are still evaluating Anthony Conner's medical condition this morning (Saturday) and he is still undergoing additional tests,"" Louisville head coach Charlie Strong said in a statement. ""As we said yesterday, there is no paralysis and Anthony has feeling throughout his extremities. We appreciate all the thoughts and prayers for Anthony and his family during this difficult time."" Conner is a senior from Houston. A knee injury forced him to miss the 2010 season, according to his official bio. ""Just on the field, he was talking, and squeezing his hand, that was it,"" Strong said, according to the team's website. A cart carried Conner off the field. The athlete's teammates did not know the severity of the injury until after the game, when the coach told them in the locker room, Strong said. Strong thanked the Rutgers team ""for their display of class and compassion for Anthony during the game last night. The Rutgers football family went through something very similar almost a year ago and they know the severity of the situation."" Last October, Rutgers defensive tackle Eric LeGrand was left paralyzed from his neck down after he made a tackle in a game against Army. LeGrand is back in school, can stand with assistance and is making progress in his bid to walk again, Sports Illustrated writer Jon Wertheim, who spent time with him, recently told CNN's Don Lemon. ""He is realistic, but optimistic,"" Wertheim said of LeGrand. ""He still feels like he's part of the team. He obviously hasn't walked, but made strides and gotten some progress, and he's just such an outgoing, magnetic guy.""","University of Louisville player breaks neck .

"(CNN) -- The police chief of Tulsa, Oklahoma, offered a stern, succinct message Saturday to the man he believes killed three people and critically wounded two others in a spate of seemingly random shootings: ""We're coming for you."" Chief Chuck Jordan described the shootings at four separate sites -- all of which occurred early Friday within two to three miles of each other -- as ""vicious and cowardly attacks."" A survivor described the suspect as a white man, driving an ""older"" white pickup truck, according to Jordan. Police Capt. Jonathan Brooks told CNN that such a truck had been spotted at at least three of the shooting sites, around that time. Still, Jordan indicated authorities do not know the identity of the shooter. He added, too, that a basic description of a white man driving a white truck ""alone probably accounts for 50,000 people in the city of Tulsa."" With the assailant still at large, city leaders stressed that information from the public will be critical to cracking this case. ""To know that you can't walk down the street at night in your own neighborhood, that's a terrible thing,"" said city councilor Jack Henderson, who represents the district where the shootings occurred. ""The only way that this person is going to be brought to justice is we need some leads. We need some people to come forward. We need some people to tell us what you know, what it is you heard."" About 30 representatives from four different law enforcement agencies -- the Tulsa police, Tulsa County Sheriff's Office, the U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI -- are on the case, as part of a newly formed task force called ""Operation Random Shooter."" They'll be working around the clock to solicit leads, gather evidence and conduct interviews, according to Jordan. Earlier Saturday, Tulsa Mayor Dewey Bartlett told CNN that at least 40 cruisers are patrolling the affected area. He added that officers are spending the weekend ""going, literally, door to door, and asking people if they have seen anything (and) what their opinions and observations are."" What authorities do know is the first shooting occurred at 1:03 a.m. Friday, according to Brooks of the Tulsa police. That victim, 49-year-old Dannaer Fields, died at a hospital. Three minutes later, two people were shot nearby -- one of them ""pretty close to the (gunman's) vehicle and the other ... a little further away,"" the police captain said. Those two were initially in critical condition but, by Saturday evening, were believed to have improved to stable and are expected to survive, according to Brooks. Then, just before 2 a.m., a fourth shooting incident -- like the first, a fatal -- occurred. The third person killed was found around 8 a.m. next to a funeral home in a more commercial district, though Brooks said police believe he was shot much earlier. In addition to Fields, Jordan identified the other two victims as William Allen and Bobby Clark. ""It appears all the victims were out walking or in the yard,"" Brooks said. ""This (happened in) a residential neighborhood, predominantly single-family dwellings, except for the last victim."" All the victims were black. The Rev. Warren Blakney, a pastor at a city church and president of the NAACP's Tulsa branch, said the shootings could well prove to be hate crimes given that they happened in a predominantly African-American neighborhood. ""For a white male to come that deep into that area and to start indiscriminately shooting, that lends itself for many to believe that it probably was a hate crime,"" Blakney told CNN. Brooks, the police captain, said one survivor recalled how ""the suspect drives up to him, asks ... for directions and shoots him for no reason."" There is no indication the shooter used a racial slur or said anything else that might indicate his motive, according to police. Jordan acknowledged it is a ""very logical theory"" to assume they were targeted in hate crimes, but said that ""we have had no evidence"" yet to indicate that. ""Right now, I'm more worried about three of my citizens being murdered,"" the chief said. ""And if it takes us in a direction of a hate crime, that's certainly where we'll go and we'll prosecute him for that as well."" Tulsa's mayor commended city residents for already having ""really come together,"" intent on helping capture the killer. ""It should be concerning to all Tulsans, because we are all in this together,"" Bartlett said. ""Some of our fellow Tulsans have been pretty violently shot, and some of them are not here today to enjoy the weekend with their families."" CNN's Nick Valencia and Don Lemon contributed to this report.","NEW: The two survivors' conditions are thought to have improved, a police captain says .

"(CNN) -- Stakes have been raised in the museum world with the reopening after 10 years of Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum. Enough old masters were dusted down and rehung during the renovation to get a room of Russian oligarchs panting. The chance to see Rembrandt's huge and glorious ""The Night Watch"" painting once more -- it has a whole room to itself in the refurbished gallery -- is reason enough to plan some serious museum crawling on your next European trip. But do you always want to follow the crowd to the obvious treasures? Your Mona Lisas, your Van Goghs? Sometimes those artistic icons are obligatory sights but experts reveal that -- from a two-million-year-old stone tool to a life-size Roman equestrian statue made entirely of bronze -- some of the most remarkable museum and gallery highlights take a little digging. What: The Olduvai stone chopping tool. Where: The British Museum, London (Great Russell Street, +44 (0)20 7323 8299). Jeremy Hill, research manager at the British Museum, says one piece he always takes people to is a two-million-year-old stone tool from the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. ""The lump of grey rock does not look much but it is one of the oldest humanly made objects in the world and the oldest thing in the British Museum's collection,"" he says. ""It's the starting point for who we all are today."" What: Rembrandt's ""The Night Watch."" Where: The Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (Museumstraat 1; +31 20 6621 440). When the Rijksmuseum reopened this year after a decade-long refurbishment there was no question about the key exhibit. Wim Pijbes, the museum's director, told CNN that Rembrandt's ""The Night Watch"" ""is the altarpiece of the Rijksmuseum. The whole place is arranged around this beautiful masterpiece."" The 1642 painting of Amsterdam's local militias is the only artwork in the museum with a trapdoor underneath, allowing it to be removed to safety in the event of fire or other danger. What: The Marcus Aurelius statue. Where: The Capitoline Museum, Rome (Piazza del Campidoglio 1, +39 060 608). Rome's greatest treasures tend to be outdoors -- it's a giant open-air museum. But Agnes Crawford, art historian and owner of Understanding Rome tours, reckons the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius alone is worth the entrance fee to the Capitoline Museum. ""The giant, totally intact bronze is the most Roman of statues,"" she says. ""It's from the high period of empire so it's of the finest quality, and it's a heroic survivor of medieval 'recycling.'"" What: Filippo Lippi's Madonna and Child and the Two Angels. Where: The Uffizi Gallery, Florence (Piazzale degli Uffizi 6; +39 55 238 8651). The sheer size and grace of Michelangelo's ""David"" in the Galleria dell'Accademia makes it the most famous single piece in Florence. But Pier Carlo Testa, director of the Italian cultural walking tours company Artviva highlights Filippo Lippi's ""Madonna and Child and the Two Angels."" ""It's all in the way the artist has managed to depict the Madonna as modeled by his wife -- with every tenderly detailed feature, ever strand of hair, you can see he is in love with her,"" Testa says. What: The Pergamon Altar. Where: The Pergamon Museum, Berlin (Bodestrasse 3; +49 30 2 6642 4242). Few pieces are great enough to have an entire museum named after them. The Pergamon Museum in Berlin isn't exactly short of massive ancient monuments either -- but the Pergamon Altar trumps the rest. Transported from modern day Turkey, this monumental stone altar dating back to the 2nd century BC cows visitors with its size, then draws them in with astonishingly detailed friezes depicting the battles between gods and giants. What: Théodore Géricault's ""The Raft of the Medusa."" Where: The Louvre, Paris (4 Place du Louvre; +33 01 40 20 53 17). Courtney Obee Delaunay, art historian and docent for Context Travel, goes beyond the ""Mona Lisa"" to pick Géricault's monumental marriage of high art and journalistic sensationalism. ""The dramatic scene vividly depicts the makeshift raft holding the emaciated and even corpse-like survivors of French shipwreck The Medusa, abandoned by its politically appointed captain,"" she says. ""Géricault represents the figures in a very realistic, yet also heroically classical way. It creates the perfect bridge between earlier masterworks found in the Louvre and the early modern works on display at the Musée d'Orsay."" What: ""The Saliera."" Where: Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (Burgring 5; +43 1 525 240). The Kunsthistorisches Museum is home to masterpieces by the likes of Vermeer, Rembrandt, Raphael and Caravaggio but Sabine Haag, the museum's director-general, points to Benvenuto's ""Saliera"" as the must-see. ""A unique work of goldsmith art, the complex pictorial program culminates in an allegory of the cosmos with the god of the sea and the goddess of the Earth, animals, the four winds and the four times of the day,"" says Haag of the piece returned to the museum this year after another decade-long renovation. ""'The Saliera' is a truly virtuoso piece -- we know from Cellini's autobiography that he hammered the figures from gold foil with every refinement he could imagine."" What: Picasso's ""Guernica."" Where: Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid (Calle de Santa Isabel, 52; +34 917 74 10 00). Four of the 15 most expensive paintings ever sold are by Picasso, yet the work widely regarded as his greatest masterpiece would almost certainly smash all records if put up for auction. Guernica's size -- 3.5 meters by 7.8 meters -- makes it unusual, but it's the political commentary about Nazi bombing during the Spanish Civil War and the layers of symbolism piled within that make it arguably the most famous artwork of the 20th century. What: The Parthenon sculptures. Where: The Acropolis Museum, Athens (15 Dionysiou Areopagitou Street, +30 21 0900 0900) There's no greater symbol of Ancient Greek classicism than the Parthenon, and most of the treasures from Athens's hilltop temple are inside the Acropolis Museum. Dr Tom Flynn, author of ""The Universal Museum,"" says the Parthenon sculptures are the pinnacle of Greek high classical sculpture. ""Their location in the Parthenon Gallery of the New Acropolis Museums allows us to appreciate them in the context of the Parthenon itself. You can faithfully recreate their original disposition on the temple, which is visible from the gallery,"" he says. What: Mantegna's ""Dead Christ."" Where: Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan (Via Brera 28; 00 39 02 722 631). ""Leonardo da Vinci's 'Last Supper' is Milan's outstanding artwork, but it's on a convent wall, not in a museum,"" says Donald Strachan, co-author of Frommer's Italy. His favored alternative is Mantegna's ""Dead Christ,"" which was regarded as genuinely shocking when painted in the 1480s. ""It is brutal in its simplicity, unsentimental in its treatment of Jesus's pallid corpse on a slab and a masterclass in realistic foreshortening, which was a relatively recent innovation in art,"" Strachan says.","Competition in museum world heats up with reopening of Dutch treasure house .

"Jinan, China (CNN) -- Bo Xilai, the former high-flying Chinese politician whose dramatic fall from grace shook the ruling Communist Party, made a defiant court appearance Thursday, disputing several of the accusations against him at his trial in eastern China. Once considered a contender for the top rungs of China's political hierarchy, Bo is now on trial on charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. A charismatic and divisive figure when he was in power, Bo has spent more than a year in detention. During that time, his name has regularly been featured in headlines, but he has been kept out of public view. On Thursday, he returned to the spotlight, albeit one controlled by Chinese authorities. Timeline: Bo's fall from grace . Many observers had expected the high-profile court hearing in the eastern city of Jinan to stick to a script of accusation, admission and conviction. But Bo, 64, appeared to be unwilling Thursday to let all the prosecution's allegations against him go unchallenged. The Thursday session has been adjourned and proceedings will resume at 8:30 a.m. local time Friday, the Jinan Intermediate People's Court said. Testimony disputed . In posts about the proceedings on its official microblog account, the Jinan court said that Bo contested the claim that he had taken bribes from Tang Xiaolin, a businessman in the northeastern industrial city of Dalian, where Bo used to be mayor. Bo said that he had previously accepted the charge ""unwillingly"" when he was being investigated by a party disciplinary commission. ""But at that time, I didn't know the details mentioned above,"" he said, according to the court. After watching a video in which Tang detailed how he sent Bo money, Bo remarked, ""I saw an ugly performance by a person who sold his soul,"" the court said. The prosecutor showed the court written testimony from Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, who was convicted last year of murdering a British businessman. Gu's statement mentioned a safe the couple shared from which she took tens of thousands of dollars to cover expenses for her and their son, who was studying in Britain at the time. Bo reportedly described Gu's testimony as ""ridiculous"" and questioned its reliability, as it came after she received a suspended death sentence for her murder conviction. He then said that an accusation that another Dalian business executive, Xu Ming, gave him and his family a multimillion-dollar villa in the south of France is ""totally false."" Although Chinese authorities had talked of a public trial for Bo, the former party boss of the sprawling southwestern metropolis of Chongqing, journalists from the international news media weren't allowed in the courtroom. Reporters had to rely on the frequent updates from the court's microblog account and official state-run news outlets, as well as a separate briefing by officials. As it dished out details through the day, the court's account on the Twitter-like Weibo service quickly gained tens of thousands of followers. China leaves nothing to chance for Bo Xilai 'trial of the century' High conviction rate . It wasn't immediately clear whether Bo's denial of part of the allegations was an unexpected development. The court's publication of his comments suggested that authorities were comfortable with the situation. And his rejection of bribery allegations doesn't mean the court will acquit him. The conviction rate for criminal trials and their appeals in China -- where the party controls police, prosecution and courts -- stood at 99.9% in 2010, a U.S. State Department report cited the Supreme People's Court as saying. Analysts have suggested that the court proceedings are more about settling Communist Party business than delivering justice. ""It's a political exercise,"" Joseph Cheng, a political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong, said before the trial started. ""It is not a trial, per se, but a political settlement."" Bo's punishment will in part be retaliation for his audacity in challenging Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping and other top party leaders by pushing his own ""Chongqing model"" and engaging in public grandstanding, Cheng said. First photos in more than a year . Authorities published photos Thursday of Bo, who hadn't been seen in public since he was stripped of his high-ranking party posts in April 2012. One image showed him standing at the dock in a white, long-sleeved shirt, flanked by two tall uniformed police officers. His hands, clasped in front of him, were not in handcuffs, and he appeared little changed compared with pictures taken before he disappeared from public view. The court published what it said was a dialogue between Bo and the chief judge in which the defendant was cited as saying he hoped the court ""can hear my case reasonably and fairly, as well as following our country's legal procedure."" The chief judge replied that the court ""understands your concerns, and will use our legal authority fairly and in accordance to the law."" Bo's spectacular downfall -- complete with tales of murder, corruption and betrayal -- set off the Communist Party's biggest political crisis in decades. His wife is in prison. Their son, living in the United States, says he hasn't spoken to his parents in a year and half. Five members of Bo's family were in the public gallery at the trial Thursday, state media reported without providing their names. They were joined by 105 other people, including 19 journalists. Bo Xilai trial: Son Bo Guagua hopes father can 'answer his critics' A career unravels . Bo is a princeling, a term that refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence. His late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Mao and former leader Deng Xiaoping. Over the past three decades, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policymaking body of the Communist Party. A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time in Chongqing. But when his deputy, Wang Lijun, walked into the U.S. Consulate in the city of Chengdu in February of last year and told American diplomats that Bo's wife, Gu, was an accomplice in a murder case, a glittering political career began to unravel. Wang's move precipitated Bo's political demise. Soon after news of the events began to emerge, Bo was removed from his party posts. A court found Gu guilty last year of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood in a Chongqing hotel room in 2011. A family employee, Zhang Xiaojun, was also convicted in the killing and sentenced to nine years in prison. The following month, Wang was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking. He received a 15-year prison sentence. The last chapter? Bo's trial is seen as a potentially concluding chapter in the scandal. Authorities haven't said how long it will last. But with only part of the charges reportedly addressed in the first day, it appears it could go on for longer than the two days some observers had predicted. Under the bribery indictment, prosecutors accuse Bo of using his political posts to secure influence for others. They say that between 2000 and 2012, Bo, Gu and their son, Bo Guagua, received about 22 million renminbi ($3.6 million) in bribes from Tang and Xu, the Dalian businessmen. The embezzlement charge alleges that Bo and Gu transferred 5 million renminbi of public money from a construction project in Dalian to a private account through a law firm in Beijing. And the abuse of power indictment relates to Bo's actions after he was informed about his wife's involvement in the killing of Heywood and Wang's attempted defection to the United States.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich dropped their first Bundesliga points of the season under new manager Pep Guardiola Tuesday -- frustrated by a late SC Freiburg equalizer in a 1-1 draw. Guardiola made seven changes ahead of Friday's European Super Cup showdown with Chelsea, but the European champions should have still wrapped up the three points. Xherdan Shaqiri put Bayern in front in the 33rd minute at the Mage-Solar Stadium, but paid the price for failing to add to their advantage when Freiburg substitute Nicolas Hofler leveled with four minutes remaining. It has left the Bundesliga champions with 10 points from four games, a point clear of arch rivals Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and Mainz, who all boast perfect records from three games. An unbeaten Bundesliga run of 29 games, dating back to last season was also extended, but there was a worrying development for Guardiola when captain for the night, midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, limped off with an ankle injury near the end. It had all looked so promising when German international Thomas Muller completed a superb run by crossing for Swiss star Shaqiri to open the scoring. Muller and Shaqiri both had chances to double the advantage but Freiburg were rewarded for their endeavor when Sebastian Freis crossed for Hoefler to beat Manuel Neuer from close range. Bayern laid siege to the home goal in the dying moments, but could not force the winner. ""If you're only 1-0 up in the Bundesliga, things like this can always happen,"" Guardiola told Bayern's official website. ""We have only ourselves to blame,"" added regular skipper Philipp Lahm, who came on as a second half substitute. Meanwhile, Bayern's Bundesliga rivals Schalke 04 secured their passage to this season's Champions League group stages with a thrilling 3-2 win in Greece over PAOK Thessaloniki. After a 1-1 draw in Germany last week, Schalke's victory secured a 4-3 aggregate win, but they ended the match with 10 men after Jermaine Jones was red carded just after the hour mark. The score stood at 1-1 at the time, but Schalke pulled ahead for the second time when Julian Draxler scored in the 79th minute, a crucial second away goal. Konstantinos Katsouranis leveled for the home side, but Adam Szalai, with his second of the match, sealed a famous victory. In their qualifying action, Arsenal wrapped up their place in the competition proper for the 17th straight time as two Aaron Ramsey goals saw them beat Fenerbahce 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium. The English Premier League side had won the away leg in Turkey 3-0 but still fielded a strong side for the return leg, with Welsh international Ramsey again outstanding. Steaua Bucharest, Austria Vienna and FC Basel will also go into Thursday's draw.","Bayern Munich held at SC Freiburg in Bundeslia .

"(CNN) -- He runs alongside the Arsenal coach in Vietnam's capital Hanoi mile after mile. He bumps into trees and lamp posts but keeps on running. At one stage he beats his hand against the badge of the red and white Arsenal shirt that he is wearing, mimicking an often used footballer's goal celebration. Eventually to keep up with the coach he hops on a moped. The ""Running Man"" -- as Vu Xuan Tien has been dubbed -- gets his reward when the Arsenal coach stops and he is invited on board to meet the players and manager Arsene Wenger, who all sign his shirt. Man gets on Arsenal bus. Cue international headlines as the ""Running Man"" goes global. Welcome to the power of English football in Asia. ""It should be a message for all of you guys that if you really want to pursue your dreams, it can happen,"" goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny told the Arsenal website. But the ""Running Man"" is not the only one working his socks off in Asia at the moment. Arsenal are one of a number of English Premier League clubs touring Asia and Australia -- others include Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea -- as part of their pre-season preparations. The new season kicks off on August 17. ""Tours provide us with an opportunity to build our global following, and are also a great opportunity to bring thousands of supporters further afield closer to the club by giving them a chance to interact with us personally,"" an Arsenal spokeswoman told CNN. ""From a business perspective it's also important we show our commitment to building our name around the world to become more attractive to potential commercial partners and to support some of our existing partners' business objectives for whom Asia is also an important market."" The business case is clear, but to travel thousands of miles round the world, to train in humid conditions and wake up in a different hotel bed each morning seems -- on the face of it -- perhaps not an ideal way to prepare for the rigors of the English Premier League season and the challenge of the Champions League. United forward Wayne Rooney was an early casualty of the club's three-week trip to Asia, with the England international having to fly home on the tour's opening day with a hamstring injury. Dutchman Alex Buttner also picked up a hamstring injury in their friendly defeat to the Singha All-Stars in Thailand -- United's first match on the tour -- to join Rooney in the treatment room. United did not respond to CNN's questions regarding the financial importance of the Far East to the club or the physiological efficacy of these tours as a way of preparing players for a new season. While Premier League clubs press the flesh in Asia, Champions League winners Bayern Munich remained in northern Europe and held a training camp in northern Italy in Trentino early July. ""Unfortunately from a physiological perspective and as preparation for the upcoming season I can't see too many positives and more importantly there is significant chance of injury,"" Dr Craig Duncan of the Australian Catholic University, who until recently was Sydney FC's head of human performance, told CNN. ""It's a disruption and I know from my perspective in preparing teams I prefer to be based in our home location which is familiar and has all the requirements that the players require. ""The impact of travel can't be underestimated and with changing time zones comes much needed adaptation and thus loss of valuable training time. ""Players are vulnerable to injury when fatigued and travel will increase fatigue so if coaches are not careful with training loads there are potential injury issues."" Last season the Premier League kicked off on August 18, but September had the highest injury incidence rate of the season with 61 separate problems recorded in the month, whereas December showed the lowest 0.46 per game, according to respected website Physio Room. ""This isn't unusual and often it's a problem with the preparation,"" said Duncan. ""Clubs sometimes expose their players to a pre-season that has too great a training load. They see it as a time to get in as much work as possible to get them ready for the busy season ahead. ""However, the consequence of this is fatigue, thus players head into the new season in a fatigued state which exposes them to the risk of injury. ""Alternatively, if they haven't been prepared adequately (training load too low) they are also at risk at the onset of the season as the intensity is very high. ""Preparation of a team is a balancing act -- you must expose them to sufficient training load to have the players ready but not too much so that they are overly fatigued."" Dutch coach Raymond Verheijen agrees with Duncan that managers struggle to get the balance right in pre-season training. ""Most coaches make fitness training too important in pre-season,"" said Verheijen. ""They are scared to death that their team will not be fit enough for the start of the season. ""So, they train often and train long. As result, players start to accumulate fatigue over time as in the above situation it is impossible for them to recover between sessions. ""On top of that, players also have to play friendly games while not recovered. So, coaches are compromising these friendly games by playing fatigued players."" The allure of Premier League clubs can be seen by the 95,000 crowd that is expected to watch Liverpool play Melbourne Victory on Wednesday. Prior to arriving in Australia, Liverpool were in Indonesia, when Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered extended its sponsorship of the club, continuing one of the most lucrative deals in English sport. The bank, which makes almost all its money in Asia, the Middle East and Africa -- regions where Liverpool has a strong following -- has been the club's shirt sponsor since July 2010. The original deal was worth about $30.5 million a season and reportedly the new terms are broadly similar. Liverpool did not respond to CNN's questions regarding the financial importance of the Far East or player well-being, but the club's former head of fitness and conditioning Darren Burgess was more forthcoming. ""The attitude of the Liverpool players was outstanding when I was there,"" said Burgess, who is now high performance manager at Port Adelaide in Australia. ""They realize it's part of playing for a big club. ""However there's no doubt that the majority of coaches and players would rather complete pre-season at their local training centers. ""They can train in familiar surroundings, sleep in their own beds, have access to all the equipment they would need and not have the physical and mental interruption of travel. ""Physically it would definitely make for a more effective pre-season period. ""As far as countering fatigue, we tried to get the players into the Asian time zone as soon as possible and we adjusted training loads to avoid the injury risks associated with long-haul flying and pre-season training. ""We monitored the players heavily so we knew exactly who was coping with the heat/travel/training and who wasn't so we'd like to think the injury risk was minimized."" Premier League stars better get used to spending more of their time out in Asia -- the financial opportunities appear to be just too great to ignore. ""The support shown to us since we arrived in Indonesia, Vietnam and now Japan has been incredible,"" said the Arsenal spokeswoman. ""Tens of thousands of supporters have attended our activities and pre-season matches on tour in Indonesia and Vietnam, and our first fixture in Nagoya in Japan has already sold out days ahead of the fixture."" ""A new generation of supporters in each country is able to interact with the club first hand, and we hope that builds a connection that lasts for many years to come. As British sports business expert Simon Chadwick points out for most Premier League clubs less than 10% of the annual turnover comes from overseas sales, which means there is plenty of potential growth abroad. ""Overseas markets are potentially an important source of sustainable revenues,"" said Chadwick. ""However, most clubs lack either the expertise or the infrastructure to capitalize upon these revenues, plus there is a physical limit to the amount of business a club can do overseas. ""They simply can't go and play in China each week where direct player/club relations are the most important point of engagement for fans in places like China. ""That's interesting, as it hints at the potential development of globally franchised clubs in the future as we've seen with Manchester City in the MLS."" Which means the ""Running Man"" better keep on running because that Arsenal coach is likely to be soon back in Hanoi.","A number of Premier League clubs touring Asia .

"(CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot goes on trial Friday in Peru, ready to admit to killing a 21-year-old woman while planning to fight more stringent charges that could land him more time in prison, his lawyer said. About six and a half years ago, the Dutch national was considered the prime suspect in the case of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, who vanished while on a graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba. He was arrested twice but never charged in connection with Holloway's disappearance, which is still unsolved. Yet van der Sloot's trial in another high-profile case, which his lawyer said has a tenuous connection with the Holloway story, is set to go forward Friday. The 24-year-old is accused of killing Stephany Flores in his Lima hotel room in May 2010. Police say that he took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. Van der Sloot was charged last September with ""qualified murder"" and simple robbery, which together could carry a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. Flores' family later tried -- unsuccessfully -- to convince three judges from the superior court of Lima to impose an even more serious slate of charges that could have included a life sentence. His attorney, Luis Jimenez Navarro, told InSession on Wednesday that his client ""will accept at trial the charge of simple homicide. ... What he will not accept are the aggravated charges."" ""We are sure that -- with support from ... experts -- it will be determined that Joran was living in a post-traumatic state during the attack,"" Navarro said, adding that ""psychologists and psychiatrists"" will testify at van der Sloot's upcoming trial. He pointed to the Holloway case, noting that the fatal attack on Flores occurred exactly five years after the Alabama girl went missing. It has been widely reported that van der Sloot killed the woman after he believed she saw something on the Internet relating to Holloway. ""He is a young man ... who has practically lived persecuted for a crime he says he did not commit ... or for a disappearance that he cannot explain,"" the lawyer said of van der Sloot. ""Movies and books have been made ... At that age, and with other characteristics of his psychological profile, ... in that moment, he felt threatened and reacted in a brutal manner."" Jimenez said that he and his client will ask the judges for a 7- to 20-year sentence, ""which are the legal sentencing parameters for homicide."" He contended his client never planned to ""entrap ... the future victim in a casino where there are more than 30 cameras"" while he was staying in a room registered under his legal name, and then kill her. ""There was no premeditation,"" the lawyer argued. The victim's family, including her father Ricardo Flores, had pushed for stiffer charges and claimed that van der Sloot hasn't looked ""remorseful"" in court appearances. ""He had an indifferent and prideful attitude. He looks as if he has everything under control. He looks better than when he appeared on TV after he was arrested,"" Ricardo Flores told CNN last year. Three judges will preside over Van der Sloot's trial, starting Friday, and there is no jury. The proceedings will begin with the prosecutor stating the ""facts"" that have been proven in the case, as well as detailing the alleged crimes committed, according to Peruvian lawyer and University of Oklahoma professor Giovanna Gismondi. Then the lead judge will talk generally about the crime, after which van der Sloot's side will have the floor. This round of the case could include testimony from the accused, though Navarro said that van der Sloot likely wouldn't give a statement Friday though he may answer questions from judges. The other scheduled trial dates are next Tuesday and Thursday, though the judges could adjust the plans at any time. Besides the Flores' murder trial, van der Sloot also faces extradition charges to the United States. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother. He was given a total of $25,000, and authorities believe he used that money to travel to Peru and participate in a poker tournament, where he met Flores. InSession's Jean Casarez and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","On Friday, Joran van der Sloot stands trial in Peru for killing a young woman .

"(CNN) -- Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, a possible nominee to be the next secretary of state, came to Capitol Hill Tuesday to perform a private mea culpa to key Republican senators for her erroneous initial public statements about the perpetrators of the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in September in which four Americans were killed. It didn't work. After Tuesday's meeting with Rice, Sen. John McCain said, ""It is clear that the information that she gave the American people was incorrect when she said that it was a spontaneous demonstration triggered by a hateful video."" Sen. Lindsey Graham who also met with Rice observed, ""Bottom line: I'm more disturbed now than I was before."" What is the Republican theory of the case against Rice? It appears to boil down to the idea that leading Democrats covered up the involvement of terrorists in some way connected to al Qaeda in the Benghazi attack during the run-up to the close presidential election because President Obama and others in his administration had for some time said that al Qaeda was close to strategic defeat. News: Rice fails to subdue Republicans' criticism over Libya attack . Does this case make sense? First, you would have to accept that Obama, Rice and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton all knowingly deceived the American public about what had happened at the Benghazi consulate. When this notion was raised in October during the second presidential debate, Obama scolded Republican challenger Mitt Romney saying, ""the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our U.N. ambassador -- anybody on my team -- would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, Governor, is offensive."" According to a CNN poll released Tuesday most Americans agree with the president and do not believe that anyone in his administration intentionally tried to mislead them about what happened in Benghazi. Second, it was the intelligence community, not officials at the White House or State Department, that eliminated from the talking points used by Rice after the Benghazi attack the suspected involvement of the Libyan jihadist group, Ansar al-Sharia. According to accounts of former CIA director David Petraeus' closed door testimony about Benghazi to congressional intelligence committees earlier this month, the intelligence community eliminated references to Ansar al-Sharia in the talking points so as not to tip off members of the terrorist group that the CIA believed that they were responsible for the attack. Ayotte: Rice 'certainly' misled on Benghazi, but unsure of motive . The conspiracy therefore was not to mislead the American public but to mislead America's enemies. If Rice had gone beyond her unclassified talking points and said that Ansar al-Sharia was suspected to be behind the Benghazi attacks, no doubt she would now be being hounded for the unauthorized disclosure of classified information. Third, it is worth recalling that whenever there is a news event in a chaotic country on the other side of the world, first accounts about the event are often wrong. Remember the erroneous reports about another big news event last year; the death of Osama bin Laden. Initially, it was portrayed by the Obama administration that bin Laden had died during a firefight with U.S. forces in Pakistan and had used his wife as a human shield. As more accurate information subsequently came in from the field, administration officials clarified that bin Laden put up no resistance and had not used his wife as a shield. This is not conspiracy; this is the fog of war. It is also worth recalling that the situation in Benghazi was so chaotic and dangerous that it took three weeks for the FBI to get in to the city to investigate what had happened at the consulate. And it took even more time for the facts to emerge that the Benghazi mission wasn't really a consulate in any conventional sense, but was more of a CIA listening station and that two of the four Americans who had died in the attack weren't diplomats as initially portrayed but were, in fact, CIA contractors. Opinion: Why attacks on Rice are misguided . The fact that Republicans have pressed to learn more about the security arrangements at the consulate and security in Benghazi overall as well as the details of what happened the night of the attack has ended up bringing to light much useful information. But none of that information has changed the basic fact that a tragedy occurred at Benghazi, not a cover up. Rubio: Why we need answers on Benghazi . Stepping back from the whole debate about how Rice came to make inaccurate public statements about Benghazi, there is another premise of the Republican attacks upon her that deserves considerable skepticism. We are supposed to believe that because Ansar al-Sharia -- a group inspired by al Qaeda's ideas, but having no links to the terrorist group that attacked the United States on 9/11 -- was able to pull off a deadly attack in a Middle Eastern country ravaged by a recent war against a lightly defended U.S. mission, killing four, that al Qaeda is suddenly an important threat again to the United States. If you buy that, I have a bridge in Benghazi I'd like to sell you.","Peter Bergen: Susan Rice's trip to Capitol Hill wasn't a success, senators said .
He says the GOP continues to bash Rice for her mistaken explanation for Benghazi attack .
Bergen says the argument that Obama administration deliberately lied doesn't hold up .

"(CNN) -- Britain claimed three gold medals in an astonishing night of track and field action in the Olympic Stadium Saturday. Mo Farah rounded off a triumphant night for the hosts with a storming victory in the men's 10,000 meters after Games poster girl Jessica Ennis delivered in the heptathlon and a surprise victory for Greg Rutherford in the long jump. Ennis, who held an unassailable lead after the sixth event, the javelin, treated the 80,000 capacity crowd to a thrilling finish in the concluding 800m, sprinting clear of her rivals to win in two minutes 8.65 seconds. It left her just 45 points shy of the magic 7,000 points barrier and 327 ahead of world champion Tatyana Chernova of Russia. ""I am so shocked, I can't believe it. I am so happy,"" Ennis told BBC Sport. Rutherford headed the world rankings going into the Games, but his long jump gold -- the first for a Briton since Lynn Davies in 1964 -- was not widely predicted. The 24-year-old, who has battled injury in the past, took the lead in the fourth round with an 8.21m effort and jumped out to 8.31m in the fourth round, seemingly thriving on the incredible commotion which surrounded the gold for Ennis. It was left to Somali-born Farah to provide the icing on the cake and deny Ethiopian great Kenenisa Bekele a hat-trick of Olympic titles in the event. Staying off the uneven pace in the early stages of the 25-lap race, Farah slowly took closer order and finally took up the lead at the bell. He ratcheted up the pace to shrug off a clutch of dangerous challengers to cross the line in 27 minutes 30.42 seconds. His American training partner Galen Rupp took silver with Tariku Bekele edging out his brother Kenenisa for the bronze. A tearful Farah celebrated on the track with his daughter Rhianna and seven-month pregnant wife Tania. ""It's never going to get better than this, this is the best moment of my life,"" he told BBC Sport. Farah's gold was the sixth of the day for Britain, who won two in rowing and another in track cycling to cement third in the medals table. An incredible night of action was completed by Jamaica's Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who retained her Olympic 100m title in the fast time of 10.75 seconds. She edged out Carmelita Jeter of the United States win by just 0.03sec with her Jamaican teammate Veronica Campbell-Brown taking bronze. It was further indication of the strength of Jamaican sprinting ahead of the men's final Sunday where Usain Bolt defends his 100 crown under likely challenge from compatriot Yohan Blake and American Tyson Gay.","Britain win three gold medals on second night of track and field .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Indian police have arrested two more suspects and are looking for two others in the reported gang rape of a female photographer in Mumbai, authorities said. One person had been arrested earlier Saturday. The alleged rape of the 23-year-old woman in the financial hub of Mumbai on Thursday is the latest shocking sexual assault to make headlines in the South Asian nation. The unidentified victim and a male colleague were on assignment in the area for a print publication when some of the men approached them, according to Mumbai police commissioner Satypal Singh. The two had walked from a train station to a nearby mill, the woman said in a statement released by police. Two people approached them, then a third came in, claiming to be a railway employee and saying, ""Our boss has seen you taking photos, you will have to come with us."" According to the woman, this third man refused to let her talk to his boss, instead leading them away. Then, sometime near the exit, one of the accused pointed at the photojournalist's colleague as being responsible for a killing in that location a few days ago. ""I pleaded with them to let us go, but they shouted at me and threatened me,"" the woman said. She and her colleague were taken further inside the mill complex. There, they offered their camera and phone, begging to be let go. Instead, ""they tied my friend's hands with (a) belt"" as two others joined the group, the woman said. ""Three people stayed with my friend, and the two took me behind a wall,"" she added. That's where the attack allegedly occurred -- even as the victim said her mother called her phone multiple times, before one of the men switched it off. The woman said she was threatened with, among other things, sharp pieces of a broken beer bottle. Police have since released sketches of all five suspects. The victim was in stable condition at a local hospital, . The attack rocked Mumbai residents, who consider their city safer than the capital, New Delhi. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 221 rape cases were reported in Mumbai in 2012. But figures provided by the government show that there has been a rape reported to police every day in Mumbai between January and March. The average number of reported rapes in a month in 2013 in the city rose to 30.33, from 19.25 in 2012. Delhi Police said the number of reported rapes in the capital had jumped from 179 for the first 3Â½ months of last year to 463 for the same period this year. A rise in the number of rapes reported does not necessarily mean that more are being committed. It may be that recent high-profile cases have encouraged women to come forward with complaints. The case mirrors the December gang rape and death of a 23-year-old university student in the Indian capital. The victim later died at a hospital in Singapore, sparking an outcry that quickly grew to include widespread concerns about women's safety and inequalities, triggering demonstrations in various cities. In response, the nation's lawmakers have introduced tougher laws and punishments for sexual crimes and harassment. Despite such action, frequent episodes of sexual violence are reported in India. Across India, 24,923 cases of rape were reported last year, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Journalist Dharmesh Thakkar contributed to this report from Mumbai, and CNN's Greg Botelho contributed from Atlanta.","NEW: Victim says she and her colleague were approached in a mill compound .

"Washington (CNN) -- On a typical Monday morning, lines of travelers heading toward the security checkpoint at Washington's Reagan National Airport snake past a sign that reads: ""Not much longer. 25 min. approximately from this point."" But wait times could lengthen if millions of dollars in mandated spending cuts force the Transportation Security Administration to trim the number of agents that screen passengers and cargo for bombs, guns and other prohibited items. From military training to educational grants to border patrols to hurricane relief, federal agencies face $85 billion in automatic, government-wide spending cuts this year. It was part of a $1.2 trillion deal struck by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama in 2011 to extend U.S. borrowing authority and cut the deficit. By the Numbers: Automatic spending cuts . That budget measure -- a kind of fiscal doomsday device called sequestration -- was extended for two months this year already. Unless Congress and the president reach a deal to avert them, those spending cuts come due on March 1. Federal agencies are busy trying to find ways to minimize the impact and delay immediate reductions. Lawmakers are wringing their hands with forecasts of doom and gloom, all the while playing a game of political chicken. Democrats, who offered their own plan Thursday, want to replace the automatic cuts with a mix of tax increases and more gradual spending cuts. Republicans want to replace it solely with other spending cuts. Then there are those who may be willing to bring the hammer down and let the cuts occur, hinting that a dramatic curtailment in spending is exactly what the government needs to ease its multi-trillion-dollar debt. ""Tea party people are saying the sequester is a pittance,"" Sen. Rand Paul, a leader of the tea party faction of the Republican party, told CNN's Candy Crowley. ""It's just very much the beginning. $1 trillion? We're going to increase spending by $9 trillion. So even with the sequester, spending goes up by $7-or-$8 trillion over the next several years. We're not even getting close to scratching the surface of the problem."" Still, caught in the middle are thousands of U.S. military members, teachers and federal workers who are at the backbone of government's basic ability to function. Military pay in play in game of political poker . Cuts could hit education, the IRS, border patrols . In education, those cuts could mean $725 million less for a program that allocates funding to districts and schools with high percentages of lower income students, Education Secretary Arne Duncan told lawmakers Thursday. It also could mean cutting funding to 70,000 low-income children who rely on Head Start for early childhood education programs. It might mean fewer teachers and staff, larger class sizes, less tutoring and higher unemployment, Duncan said, adding that he considered such cuts ""morally indefensible."" ""The most vulnerable students will be hurt the most,"" Duncan said. Duncan, along with Office of Management and Budget Federal Controller Daniel Werfel, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee on the impact of the proposed cuts. Earlier this week, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano sent a letter to lawmakers saying sequester cuts could mean a potential cut in border patrol agents; difficulties for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in sustaining current detention and removal operations; increased passenger wait times at airports; reduced Federal Emergency Management Agency funding: furloughs, and more. Spending cuts to hurt homeland security . Donovan testified that Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts, the Federal Housing Administration's ability to process loans and tens of thousands of jobs could all be affected. Air Force bases cancel air shows . Officials at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia and Luke Air Force Base in Arizona on Friday canceled their upcoming air shows, citing both budgetary pressures and the expected consequences of sequestration. ""I cannot in good conscience spend some of our limited resources to host an open house while the Defense Department considers potential civilian furloughs,"" said Brig. Gen. Michael Rothstein, 56th Fighter Wing commander at Luke. The open house and air show was scheduled for March 16 and 17. A statement from the base said officials were taking other money-saving steps, such as deferring non-mission-critical repairs and supply purchases and significantly reducing flying not directly related to pilot training. ""The Air Force has to consider the fiscal challenges affecting the Department of Defense and the nation,"" said Col. Korvin Auch, 633rd Air Base Wing commander at Langley. ""We're taking prudent steps now in order to be good stewards of taxpayer resources while focusing on maintaining readiness."" Senate Democrats offer plan to avert mandatory cuts . Sequester may be inevitable . Despite varying efforts to come up with a solution to avert sequester, some leaders are acknowledging the cuts may be inevitable. ""It is pretty clear to me that the sequester is going to go into effect,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Tuesday. In the last Congress, the GOP-led House passed the same measure twice to replace the across-the-board cuts with another set of federal reductions. But that bill went nowhere in the Democratic controlled Senate. The $110 billion measure proposed Thursday by Senate Democrats calls for replacing the sequester with a combination of increased tax revenue from millionaires, ending agriculture subsidies and reducing defense spending after the war in Afghanistan ends. By the numbers: Recent defense spending . But congressional Republicans have made clear any tax increases to avoid the sequester are a non-starter. House Speaker John Boehner criticized the cuts, even though they were part of the 2011 debt-ceiling proposal he brokered. He has worked to pin the blame for them on Democrats. ""The sequester is bad policy. It's taking a meat ax approach to cutting government spending. That's why the president ought to be forthcoming with a plan to replace his own sequester,"" Boehner said. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta put it a bit more bluntly. ""For those of you who have ever seen (the movie) 'Blazing Saddles,' it is the scene of the sheriff putting the gun to his head in order to establish law and order,"" Panetta said in a speech at Georgetown University. ""That is sequestration."" CNN's Jim Acosta, Ted Barrett, Tom Cohen, Jeanne Sahadi, Matt Snith and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .","NEW: Two Air Force bases cancel air shows, citing budget cuts and sequestration .

"(CNN) -- Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates thinks one of the answers to improving health is in the bathroom. A year ago, his foundation issued a challenge to universities to create a new toilet, launching a worldwide effort to improve sanitation. This week the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced who won the challenge. California Institute of Technology was the big winner and was awarded $100,000 for its idea of a solar-powered toilet that generates hydrogen and electricity. The United Kingdom's Loughborough University won second place and was awarded $60,000 for a toilet that produces biological charcoal, minerals, and clean water. The University of Toronto in Canada garnered third place and $40,000 for a toilet that sanitizes feces and urine and recovers resources and clean water. The new commodes are being showcased at a ""Reinvent the Toilet Fair"" Tuesday and Wednesday in Seattle. The foundation also announced a second round of grants totaling some $3.4 million to organizations that are working to innovative latrines. While many may not want to ponder creative ideas about human waste, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation says these creations are vitally important. About 2.5 billion people don't have access to modern toilets, and this lack of access encourages the spread of diarrheal diseases, which are blamed for the deaths of 1.5 million children each year, according to the World Health Organization. ""Innovative solutions change people's lives for the better,"" Bill Gates said. ""If we apply creative thinking to everyday challenges, such as dealing with human waste, we can fix some of the world's toughest problems."" The fair in Seattle will also bring together researchers, designers and investors from 29 countries, the Gates foundation says. ""Imagine what's possible if we continue to collaborate, stimulate new investment in this sector, and apply our ingenuity in the years ahead,"" said Gates. ""Many of these innovations will not only revolutionize sanitation in the developing world, but also help transform our dependence on traditional flush toilets in wealthy nations.""","Bill Gates announces winner of tiolet challenge .

"(CNN)  -- Esra'a al Shafei, a recent university graduate in Bahrain, is young, Muslim and frustrated. Young Muslims, pictured here in Afghanistan, are increasingly using technology to engage the world. The 23-year-old says the complexity of who she is as a Muslim is being distorted by extremists and the media coverage of them. Channeling her frustration, she started Mideastyouth.com, a Web site she describes as a place for young people in the region to ""show a different side of our religion"" and discuss topics big and small, taboo and not. She represents a generation of Muslims who are using technology to express themselves, connect with others, challenge traditional power structures and create an identity in an era when Islamic extremists often grab the headlines. ""I think the word that clearly defines the younger generation and also separates them from their parents is 'globalized,'"" said Reza Aslan, the author of two books on Islam, including the recently published ""How to Win a Cosmic War: God, Globalization and the End of the War on Terror."" Access to technology lags in countries with large Muslim populations compared with Europe and the United States. Access also varies between those countries depending on a variety of factors such as governmental control and economic development. But the numbers of people using the Web and cell phones are growing -- and quickly. ""The percentage increases of Internet users in places like Iran, Pakistan and Egypt are astronomical during the past five years,"" Aslan said. A recent study by Forrester Research predicted growth rates for Web usage would continue to soar in the region during the next five years. A battle over interpretation . Al Shafei, who spoke to CNN by phone from Bahrain, said her Islamic identity was partly shaped by a childhood that included Christian classmates and American and British teachers. She also grew up in a country that was relatively progressive enough to appoint a female Jewish ambassador recently. ""Islam is much more relaxed here,"" she said. ""But it doesn't mean we're not good Muslims."" She discovered blogs, and the more she read, the more she grew frustrated with the nature of the dialogue. ""No one was talking to each other,"" she said. The conflict between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006 was the turning point for her. ""I was really annoyed by how the Western and Arab media were covering it,"" she said. ""Both sides were sticking to the extremes."" She said she started her Web site that year to provide the world -- and media -- a different perspective on Islam. ""We're not as simplistic as the media would often make of us,"" she said. Al Shafei said the Web site's discussion subjects range from the political to the taboo, including homosexuality, premarital sex and atheism. The anonymity provided by the Web helps foster such discussion, she said. She is, however, careful to avoid talking about some topics, which could get her in trouble. ""I always remind myself that I have my limitations,"" she said. ""There are various issues that I am unable to tackle for security reasons."" Al Shafei said she hopes that Web sites such as hers could help fight extremist Islamic groups by defeating their arguments through cultural and religious dialogue. But she concedes there's catching up to do. ""We have to move faster"" because extremist groups are more widespread in traditional media such as newspapers and radio stations, which are still consumed by more people than new media such as Web sites, she said. The extremists' lure . Some extremists are adept at using technology and new media as well. The killings of journalist Daniel Pearl, U.S. businessman Nicholas Berg and Eugene Armstrong, an American contractor working in Iraq, were all recorded and later broadcast on the Web. It's long been a concern that the Web is being used by extremist groups such as al Qaeda to recruit young Muslims to their cause. However, Bruce Etling, who co-authored recent studies of the Arabic and Persian blogospheres at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society, said he found little evidence of such activity. ""In the Arabic blogosphere we found no specific clusters related to extremism, and when it was discussed, it tended to be in negative terms,"" he said. ""It was a counter-narrative we were surprised to find."" There are several possible reasons why, he explained. It's difficult for extremist groups to maintain a static presence on the Web -- they constantly have to move to avoid being found. Additionally, popular sites such as Facebook have strict terms of usage, which make it difficult for extremist groups -- and their sympathizers -- to build a following. Aslan, who is also the executive editor of the social-networking Web site Mecca.com, said that research has consistently shown that the Internet is not an effective recruiting tool for extremists. He said extremist groups use the Web more as a marketing and communication tool. ""Nobody, absolutely nobody, straps a bomb on their body because they were recruited from the Internet,"" he said. ""It takes an enormous amount of personal face-to-face contact and time in order to recruit a young person into the cause of jihad."" The Web and the streets . Observers say that like other young people around the world, Muslims mostly use technology such as cell phones and the Web for social and recreational reasons, not political. Jared Cohen traveled through the Middle East from 2004 through 2006 for his book, ""Children of Jihad: A Young American's Travels Among the Youth of the Middle East."" He joined the U.S. State Department in September, 2006. He said his travels showed him that the same tools young Muslims are using to socialize also are helping them organize. While at an underground party in Iran a few years ago, he asked the Iranians how they heard about the gathering. They told him that if he were to go to the marketplace during the day and turn on his Bluetooth, he could receive random messages with details on where to go and at what time. Western-style parties and music are prohibited in Iran, so young people hold them secretly to evade security. Cohen said the partygoers were dismissive when asked if they were afraid of the security forces finding out. ""No one over 30 knows what Bluetooth does,"" the young Iranians told him. That knowledge and tech savviness played a significant role in the recent protests after the disputed Iranian election. Protesters used Twitter, cell phones and other social-networking tools to organize and spread word of what was happening on the streets. The impact on Islam: A new identity? The post-election fallout in Iran is one example that portends a broader generational and hierarchical struggle in the Muslim community, some experts say. There are a lot of young Muslims. By some estimates, about 60 percent of Muslims in the Middle East are under the age of 30. ""What the printing press is to Christianity in the 16th century, that's what the Internet is doing to Islam now,"" Aslan said. ""It has opened up the monopoly over the interpretation of Islam that used to solely belong to the religious class."" Some clerical authorities, well aware of the challenges posed to their influence by the powers of the Web, are becoming more tech savvy and are building a digital presence, Aslan says. But their interpretations and authority increasingly have competition from sites created by young Muslims such as al Shafei and online communities found on Facebook and Twitter. However, emerging technology also could be a force that helps forge a new, more global Islamic identity. Syrian Muslims can now talk to Muslims in Pakistan, Indonesia, the U.S. or Europe. ""During the 20th century, the parents of this generation were struggling to define for themselves some conception of a pan-Arab or pan-Muslim unity,"" Aslan said. ""But that was elusive because there are so many things geopolitically that separate the Muslim world. ""With the Internet, those boundaries, those borders are irrelevant.""","The number of young Muslims using the Web is rising, experts say .
They're using it to express themselves and connect with others .
These tools also are providing a way to organize socially and politically ."
"(CNN) -- Phil Mickelson is making a habit of setting pulses racing with inspired birdie filled charges this year and Friday was no exception on the TPC Boston. 'Lefty' completed his first nine holes in a mere 28 shots to put the world's media on 59 alert again before closing with an eight-under 63 for the early lead at the Deutsche Bank Championship. Two bogeys coming home on the front nine, he started on the 10th tee, scuppered the hopes of headline writers, but he did mix that with a superb eagle on the second, nearly holing his approach for an albatross. Playing his last hole, the 43-year-old American need a birdie to equal the course record 61 of Mike Weir back in 2008, but instead made a five for an anti climactic ending after finding trouble off the tee. Nonetheless he had outplayed playing partners Tiger Woods, who is still well placed after a 68 and Masters champion Adam Scott, winner of the Barclays last week, but struggling to an opening 73. Mickelson, who carded seven birdies in his first nine holes, said he always knew it would be a little tougher on the next nine. ""I still felt I could have shot three or four under (for that nine), but I wasn't too worried about shooting 59,"" he told the official PGA Tour website. Englishman Brian Davis later matched Mickelson's eight-under effort to leave them one clear of in-form Kevin Stadler in the second tournament of the money spinning FedEx Cup. Earlier this season, Mickelson narrowly missed a birdie putt on the last green as he opened with a 60 at the Phoenix Open, going on to win the tournament by four shots. And in testing final round conditions at Muirfield, Mickelson conjured up four birdies in the last six holes to claim the British Open title for the first time. It was the fifth major of his career and he admitted afterwards probably the most satisfying, particularly after having to settle for his sixth runner-up spot at the preceding U.S. Open won by Justin Rose. Defending champion Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland admitted to ""silly mistakes"" after opening with a one-under 70, looking to kick start a disappointing season after his heroics of 2012. Meanwhile, lowly ranked Welshman Liam Bond was the surprise leader of the Wales Open at halfway Friday. Ranked 1,528th in the world, 43-year-old only received a late invite to the $1.8 million event and has carded rounds of 69 and 68 to move to five-under. First round leader Espen Kofstad of Norway and South African Tjaart van der Walt were next on four under with European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley also in the hunt after a 69 for three-under.","Phil Mickelson takes early lead at Deutche Bank with eight under 63 .

"(CNN) -- Flo Meiler is 79 years old. She's a grandmother to five, great-grandmother to two. She's also a pole-vaulting, hurdle-jumping track and field star. In 2011, she set the world indoor record in the pole vault for women over the age of 75. She set the world record for the 60-meter hurdles and the 4x100 meter relay that same year. She has also set records in the steeplechase, the discus, the 200-meter hurdles and the hammer throw. In total, Meiler holds 15 world records and 12 U.S. records -- not bad for a woman who picked up pole vaulting at 65. Meiler, of Shelburne, Vermont, and more than 10,000 other seniors are taking their athletic prowess to Cleveland this weekend for the 2013 National Senior Games. CNN spoke with Meiler about her love of the long jump, her favorite world record and why other people thinks she's, well, ""a little nuts."" The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: Have you been active your whole life, or is this a new development? Flo Meiler: Oh, I think I've been pretty active, but more active since I took up track and field at age 60. Believe it or not, I'm more active now. CNN: How did you get into the sport so late? Meiler: I was playing tennis -- singles, doubles and mixed doubles with my husband -- for the senior Olympics, and my training partner now, Barbara Jordan, came over and said, ""We need people in track and field desperately, and I think you would be good at it."" And I said, ""Well, don't look at me, I've never done track in my life."" She said, ""When you're done your tennis, come over and try the long jump."" So that's what I did ... and I fell in love with it immediately. The year afterwards, I competed for the first time in track and field, and I did the long jump. I came in fourth out of 25 women. And in the high jump, I tied for third. Don't you think that didn't motivate me? (laughs) For being a track and field person for the first time? So that got me going. And my training partner is a real go-getter and very hard worker. We both have broken all kinds of U.S. and world records. We challenge each other -- but if one wins, gets a better score, it's fine. We're always in agreement, and we're always good friends. CNN: What is it about track and field that you like? Meiler: Track and field is very challenging. My training partner, she excels more in the 100 and 200 sprints and stuff. I like the pole (vault) and the hurdles -- they're more challenging for me. CNN: What do you like about pole vaulting? Meiler: People think I'm a little nuts, I think (laughs). I was 65 when I first took it up. I was at a senior meet, and I saw some ladies doing it, and it didn't look like they were going very high. I always like challenges, and I said, ""Boy, this looks like a real good challenge for me."" That's why I took it up. It's the most difficult sport, and it's also the most challenging. It's the most rewarding, I think. Believe it or not, in the (women's) 75-and-over (group) I have the world record. I have that under my belt, and that is a fantastic feeling. The height was 6'3"" and a quarter, but I've done 6'8"" before. Not too bad. CNN: That must take a lot of upper-body strength. Meiler: It's mostly upper core. You have to have a strong upper core and very strong arms, because all the strength is in your arms and the upper part of your body. CNN: What's your training schedule like? Meiler: On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I do a lot of track. Some days, we will do 25-meter sprints; then we will increase to 50 meters. Then, we'll go up to 100 meters several times. Then we might do a few 200-meter runs. We change our training day-to-day. On Wednesday, we might practice our hurdles. Barb doesn't do a lot of the throwing events, and I do, so on some other days, I'll do the shot put. Like this morning, I did my javelin few times, and then I did my hammer. And I only took up hammer maybe four years ago, but I really enjoy it. And then my discus -- I really enjoy discus, too. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'll do weights with the machines. And I play tennis also. And do some pushups at home -- they're the women's pushups, not the men's pushups. It takes a lot of training. You have to be very, very devoted. CNN: What's the hardest part about keeping up with it? Meiler: In the wintertime, when it's about 10 degrees outside, and you're underneath the covers, and you say, ""Oh, I'd love to sleep in for another couple hours."" But I know that my training partner is waiting ... and I can't not go. I have to be there. We're very fortunate that we can train together. I always recommend that if someone wants to take up new sport or any other activity, they should do it with a friend, because it is so much more enjoyable because you help each other. You encourage each other. CNN: Are there any events you don't particularly like? Meiler: I'm not too keen on doing the 100- and 200-meter runs ... but I do them all! Sometimes, I do the pentathlon, and that's (five) events. You have to do that in two days. That's quite hectic. Barbara and I and two other girls from the U.S. at the 2012 world meet in Sacramento, we set a world record in the 4x100 relay, so that was quite an accomplishment. CNN: You have so many. What's your favorite record? Meiler: I really enjoyed getting the world record in the 60-meter hurdles in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was an indoor meet. I barely beat my training partner (laughs). We were neck and neck. CNN: What is your diet like? What do you eat to stay healthy and active? Meiler: I take a healthy nutrition shake every morning. It's made with orange juice, and it's got all good nutrients in it. And then I just eat a regular lunch and dinner. I eat almost anything, and I do cheat once in a while. I do like those French fries once in a while (laughs). I have a downfall for chocolate-covered almonds. I watch my weight. When I gain 2Â½ pounds, and I can tell on me right away, and I don't feel comfortable. CNN: What advice would you give to other seniors out there who might want to try something new? Meiler: I keep telling them that it's never too late. If I can take up track and field at 60, anybody can take up another sport at age 50 and up. I recommend anyone who really looks at wanting to be healthy, they have to get going, get off the couch. One of the recommendations I have been mentioning is go to their senior center. My friends go for yoga, and there are a lot of other things they offer. If they really want to improve or do something more athletic, the center will have the resources to help them find what they should do and how safe it can be. CNN: Speaking of safety, have you ever been injured on the field? Meiler: Oh, I've had a few injuries. I've had a few hamstring pulls. But with a couple visits to the physical therapist, I heal very quickly. I think it's because I'm in such good physical condition. The more severe one I got was splitting my knee open on the barrier when I was doing the steeplechase. I got maybe a dozen stitches there. But I healed up within a couple weeks, and I was right back doing the same thing. You're a little hesitant, though, after you get 12 stitches. You say, ""Uh oh, you better be careful.""","Flo Meiler, 79, holds 15 world records and 12 U.S. records in track and field .

"(CNN) -- Whenever the U.S. Transportation Security Administration changes the way it screens passengers, it's bound to cause a stir. This time is no different. The TSA's move this week to allow small pocket knives on airplanes has generated a storm of criticism and concern among aviation professionals and passengers alike. Critics are outraged by a new rule that will allow knives with very short blades onto aircraft. The agency says it believes knives cannot be used to hijack planes because of strengthened cockpit doors and more passenger awareness. ""This policy reversal is against the best interest of the security of crew and passengers in the aircraft cabin and we will stop at nothing to fight it,"" said the Flight Attendants Union Coalition, in a press statement issued Thursday announcing its campaign to reverse the TSA's decision. The coalition represents nearly 90,000 unionized flight attendants at carriers across the country. Former flight attendant Tiffany Hawk is ""stupefied"" by the TSA's decision to allow knives ""especially since the process that turns checkpoints into maddening logjams -- removing shoes, liquids and computers -- remains unchanged,"" she wrote in an opinion column for CNN. Under the new rules, knives with blades that are 2.36 inches (6 centimeters) or shorter and less than a 1/2 inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins as long as the blade is not fixed or does not lock into place. Razor blades and box cutters are still prohibited. The rules also allow passengers to carry two golf clubs, toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry-on luggage. TSA chief John Pistole said the changes, which will take effect April 25 and will bring the United States into alignment with international rules, are in keeping with his ""risk-based security"" approach. Putting less focus on these items will permit airport screeners to focus on looking for bomb components, which present a greater threat to aircraft. New rule doesn't go far enough, former chief says . Sharp objects can no longer bring down aircraft, former TSA chief Kip Hawley told CNN, and the search for knives interferes with the search for objects that can threaten aircraft. ""They ought to let everything on that is sharp and pointy. Battle axes, machetes ... bring anything you want that is pointy and sharp because while you may be able to commit an act of violence, you will not be able to take over the plane. It is as simple as that,"" said Hawley, who oversaw the TSA from mid-2005 through early 2009. Focusing on the wrong threat . Security expert Rafi Ron says the TSA should focus on risky people rather than risky objects. ""When you have someone like you or me who doesn't intend to attack a flight, whether we have a Swiss Army knife in our pocket or not doesn't make any difference,"" said Ron, president of Virginia-based New Age Security Solutions and former head of security of Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel. ""If you have somebody like one of the terrorists (who was involved in the 9/11 attacks) or a terrorist who is still out there, I'm not sure we'd want him to have even a Swiss Army knife,"" Ron said. ""Risk is not measured by the item, whether it is a knife or gun. It is measured by the person holding it. A bad guy with a Swiss Army knife can still cause a lot of damage to the crew and passengers in the cabin before the aircraft can land."" What's critical is to be able to apply a heightened level of search to potentially dangerous people beyond who's on the ""No Fly"" list, he said. The shoe bomber and underwear bomber ""are people who could have been identified as high risk passengers if we had bothered to screen them,"" he said, referring to Richard Reid's attempted airline attack in 2001 and an attempted attack in 2009 by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab. Some clues: ""Both of them bought one-way tickets, paid in cash, both of them didn't check any baggage for a trans-Atlantic flight. They should have been subjected to a different level of search,"" Ron said. Terrorism's ultimate goal . While he sympathizes with the concerns of flight attendants that knives and other objects could be used to hurt people, there are already objects in the cabin that mentally or emotionally disturbed people could use to inflict injury, said Richard Bloom, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's chief academic officer and director of terrorism, intelligence and security studies. ""That has nothing to do with terrorism,"" said Bloom. ""Given that any organization, including the TSA, has only so many people and so much money, what they're trying to do is get less relevant things out of their attention and pay more attention to things that are more catastrophic."" An ever changing list of banned objects . The TSA's evolving list of banned objects has drawn mixed reaction from travelers. ""Let's allow knives on board, but you are not allowed a bottle of water, or a bottle of baby food,"" wrote one CNN.com reader. Another seemed to take a more positive view: ""I almost had my kids' safety scissors confiscated from their little activity kit. Yay for this sensible decision."" Commenter Jose L. Reynoso was more skeptical. ""Yeah sure one man against a bunch of others is no match but, what if ten men carrying knives and bats plot to take over? Wouldn't a massacre be obvious?"" Reynoso wrote. A more flexible aviation security system? A country's security services need to be collecting intelligence on potential terrorists way before passengers board an aircraft, said Bloom. And any airport's security team needs to have flexible and layered screening in place to be able to adjust its processes for high-risk individuals. ""The threat is ever-changing."" CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report .","The latest TSA move to allow some knives and sports equipment is causing a furor .
Flight attendants have created petitions demanding the TSA reverse its policy .
Security experts say the policy doesn't address the need to evaluate travelers, not things ."
"Trion, Georgia (CNN) -- Christopher Wolfe has a Tough As Nails, I Love America attitude. His pride swells along with his tattooed biceps. He's a dying breed, a blue-collar American working on a product as American as apple pie. Blue jeans. ""This is our lifeline,"" Wolfe says. Those jeans you squeezed into this morning? It's likely they began right here at Mount Vernon Mills, one of the last functioning cotton mills in America and the nation's No. 1 producer of denim. In a tiny enclave of northwest Georgia, Wolfe and 1,200 of his colleagues churn out enough denim per week for 800,000 pairs of blue jeans. Most U.S. mills shut down years ago, unable to compete with cheap overseas labor. And in another sign of the global economy, the fabric woven here is rarely sent to American plants to be turned into jeans. Instead, the fabric is shipped mostly to factories in Mexico. The jeans then carry labels that read ""Made in Mexico of U.S. fabric."" Blame NAFTA. Blame outsourcing. Blame corporate greed for the selling out of America's manufacturing soul. ""I'd rather see people over here work, instead of struggling -- instead of giving somebody in another country a chance to make money that [Americans] should be making,"" says Wolfe, 31. He's got a scar across his forehead, a shaved head and goatee. Like a pair of well-worn blue jeans, he's rough and tough. Some workers here are second- and third-generation employees, following in the footsteps of their fathers, mothers and grandparents. Wolfe's dad and brother work at the mill. You can see the pride in their faces: Made in U.S.A., baby. ""We contribute a lot to America,"" Wolfe says with a smile. He's a father of four young daughters. He makes about $9 an hour. He toils for them, for his little girls, so they can have a better a life. ""This mill here,"" he says, ""it feeds my family."" It has been in existence since 1845, when slaves handpicked cotton in the South. Back then, mill workers spun the cotton into fabric and shipped it to factories in the North. It's said Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman came through Trion, Georgia, during the Civil War and decided not to burn the factory down. The reason remains town lore. Some speculate the Union general might've been treated to the charms of Southern hospitality at the local hotel (wink, wink). What's a good Southern tale without -- dare we say it? -- some yarnspinning. ""Boss Man"" who fights for workers . Inside, you can't help but marvel at the scene around you. Hundreds of spools of thread churn all at once, with computer-like precision. There's a million-square-feet of manufacturing space, much of it Canadian rock maple hardwood floors. It's clean with a brilliant shine. Thread shoots every which way, as if Spider-Man came through. Go from cotton field to denim . The sweet, distinct smell of cotton permeates the mill -- like that of nature in a hardwood forest, with the faint hint of a wet Labrador retriever. When you walk through with general manager Don Henderson, the workers pause. They glance at ""Boss Man"". Many stroll over to shake his hand. How you doing? Everything, OK? Henderson is one reason this place is still in business, on American soil. He has an aww-shucks attitude. He'll tell you it's those men and women out there on the floor that keep it going. He's got pride in the plant, in his workers and in his family. His father worked for 39 years in the spinning department. His brother retired from the plant after 42 years, having started when he was 16 and eventually making his way into management. ""If I had the ultimate say-so, we would be right here for the next 100 years,"" says Henderson, 64, who has worked in the plant for 40 years. While the nation's manufacturing base has shrunk, Mount Vernon Mills is a rare exception. The tiny town of Trion -- pronounced Try-On, as in ""our residents always 'try on,'"" 78-year-old Mayor Benny Perry says -- has a staggeringly large annual budget for such a small town. Its $12 million, mostly from taxes the mill pays, provides a state-of-the-art public school, park space and athletic fields. If the mill shuttered, ""it would destroy the town,"" Perry says. In its heydey, the mill had 5,000 workers in the 1940s and 1950s. The company owned everything in town back then, from the tiny mill houses that surround the plant to the town hospital where Henderson and many of his co-workers were born. As a result, Trion doesn't have a quaint town square. The mill is the centerpiece. About two years ago, when the nation's recession hit hard, the plant had to layoff about 200 workers. ""It was awful,"" Henderson says. To save as many jobs as possible and to maximize efficiency, the plant switched to two, 12-hour shifts. That's down from three shifts, five days a week. The denim for jeans goes to companies as wide-ranging as Wal-Mart to JCPenney to Dickies to Polo and other high-priced brands. Henderson's most proud of the mill's ties to cowboys. ""We make the Wrangler rodeo cowboy jeans that all the rodeo guys still wear,"" he says. ""We make the fabric right here and have been for -- gosh -- 30 years."" Henderson holds up one roll of distressed fabric that's nearly ready to be shipped. It's denim that once was used for lower-end clothing. But yuppies like the look. Henderson chuckles and shakes his head. Martha Teague is 63 and has worked in the mill for the past 35 years. She says other company towns had bosses that sold them out, that cared more about the dollar than its people. ""It just gives me a good feeling to be a part of that family of Mount Vernon Mills,"" says Teague, who has a son working at the plant. ""It has educated my children and gives us a house and everything we have really."" Wolfe wheels 13,000 yards of yarn into the dimly lit ""ballroom."" It's placed among a heap of others. ""We're lucky to have what we got. Other small towns, they don't have that."" He turns and walks away in the orange glow of the ballroom. You want to know a secret? A $12 pair of jeans often comes from the same roll of denim as a $150 designer pair.","Cotton mill in northwest Georgia is America's No. 1 producer of denim .

"(CNN) -- A popular female Pakistani singer who defied the Taliban's decree against singing and dancing was shot and killed in northwest Pakistan Monday night, police and hospital officials told CNN. Authorities described the singer's ex-husband as a suspect in the case, and said early indications were that the Taliban were not involved, according to police official Imtiaz Altaf. Ghazala Javed, who recorded scores of songs in her native Pashto language and became a household name among young, progressive ethnic Pashtuns in northwest Pakistan, had just left a beauty salon and was driving home with her father when gunmen on a motorcycle raced towards their car and sprayed it with bullets, Altaf said. Javed was hit with six bullets and pronounced dead at a hospital in Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, according to hospital official Rahim Afridi. Javed's father also was killed, police said. In recent years the rise of the Pakistani Taliban in the region and the group's ban against singing and dancing made it difficult for Javed and other musical artists to perform and record songs in Pakistan. Javed recorded and taped many of her latest songs and music videos in nearby Dubai. Last year Javed made headlines when she asked for a divorce from her husband after she reportedly found out that he had at least one other wife. It was a rare decision in a deeply conservative and male-dominated society where many view a woman's demand for a divorce as a dishonor to the husband. Shortly after Monday night's shooting police released a statement saying Javed's sister had accused her ex-husband and two of his acquaintances .

"(CNN) -- Rob Stutzman doesn't buy too many books. But he not only read Lance Armstrong's bestseller ""It's Not About the Bike"" cover to cover, he also recommended it to several friends. Now, the public affairs consultant from Sacramento, California, wants his money back, and he wants the disgraced cyclist to pony up. Stutzman is part of a class-action lawsuit against Armstrong and his book publishers accusing them of peddling fiction as fact. Joining Stutzman is a Sacramento chef and cycling enthusiast, Jonathan Wheeler, who says he too was moved and inspired by the Armstrong book. Why we cheat . The lawsuit, filed this week in federal court in California, also mentions Armstrong's other book, ""Every Second Counts,"" and accuses the cyclist and his publishers of fraud and false advertising. ""Throughout the book, Defendant Armstrong repeatedly denies that he ever used banned substances before or during his professional cycling career,"" the suit said. And the pair bought the book ""based upon the false belief that they were true and honest works of nonfiction when, in fact, Defendants knew or should have known that these books were works of fiction."" The suit may just be the tip of the iceberg. After years of vehemently denying that he used drugs to boost his performance during his record seven Tour de France wins, Armstrong confessed to Oprah Winfrey last week that he lied. His virtually tearless admission of doping could likely have litigants lining up against him like cyclists at the start of the Tour de France. 7 lessons Armstrong's confession has taught us . Already several are suing or say they will sue. The new federal lawsuit does not specify how much Stutzman and Wheeler are seeking. But it does ask for ""any statutorily permissible damages, attorneys' fees, expenses and costs."" In other words, a lot more than the price of the book. Stutzman, who is a former deputy chief of staff for former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, said he was duped into reading Armstrong's book, drawn in by the cyclist's compelling life story. And the lawsuit said he even met Armstrong years before the confession. ""At that time, Stutzman thanked Defandant Armstrong for writing his book and told him it was very inspiring and that he recommended it to friends who were fighting cancer,"" the lawsuit said. ""In response, Armstrong thanked Stutzman.""

"(CNN) -- Speed and beauty have long been the driving factors in car design, but this year's most exclusive automobiles include a few practical considerations such as alternative fuel sources and smart ideas to improve safety and cut urban congestion.  Still, the first thing about these cars that catches the eye ain't the miles per gallon (or perhaps mile per watt). Yes some of these French, Italian and German automobiles are more environmentally friendly -- but more importantly they look good doing it. Many of the car designs at the 2010 Paris auto show  focused on electric-powered cars. Energy is a central theme of the Automotive X Prize -- a self-described ""$10 million competition to inspire a new generation of viable, superefficient vehicles that people want to buy."" The contest pushed designers to come up with a conventionally powered vehicle that would top 100 MPGe (miles per gallon energy equivalent). Some of the names that grabbed attention in Paris, and at the X Prize competition and elsewhere will captivate many drivers' imaginations: Lamborghini's Sesto Elemento, the Ferrari SA APERTA, Bugatti's Super Sport and the literally electric Jaguar C-X75. The folks at Mini are offering a surprise: A scooter! Renault's electric concept car -- the DeZir -- looks like it has wings to fly. While many of these cars could empty more than a few pocketbooks, they also could save their owners a few bucks on fuel.","Hot cars of '10 include Ferrari's SA APERTA, Bugatti's Super Sport, Jaguar's electric C-X75 .

"(CNN) -- What a difference a slam makes as Sabine Lisicki again found to her cost Friday at the U.S. Open. On the green grass of Wimbledon the popular 23-year-old German swept aside No.1 Serena Williams on the way to the women's singles final where she lost to Marion Bartoli. Fast forward to the final major of the season on the hard courts of Flushing Meadows and 16th seed Lisicki made a tame third round exit to Russian Ekaterina Makarova, while Bartoli has retired and is reporting the tournament for a television company. Lisicki's career was place on hold after a nasty fall at the 2009 U.S. Open which saw her depart the court in a wheelchair and with a severe injury to her ankle. After a lengthy rehabilitation, Lisicki has shown glimpses of the form that had her talked of as a successor to the likes of Steffi Graf, culminating in her dream run to the final at Wimbledon. Early exits in two hard court tournaments in the build-up to the U.S. Open were not ideal preparation, but Lisicki came through her opening two matches against Vera Dushevina of Russia and Argentina's Paula Ormaechea in straight sets. 24th seed Makarova proved a tougher test and was always in the ascendancy in a match lasting a shade over an hour and a half. She closed it out 6-4 7-5 after breaking Lisicki for the third time to move into the last 16 in fine style. It was another grand slam disappointment for Lisicki, who has never reached the fourth round at this level other than at Wimbledon. Earlier, China's Li Na revenged a 2012 defeat at the U.S. Open when she beat British teenager Laura Robson 6-2 7-5, while third seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland also progressed to the fourth round, beating Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia. Men's top seed Novak Djokovic was largely untroubled in beating Germany's Benjamin Becker 7-6 6-2 6-2 to move into the third round. Djokovic saved two sets points as Becker served for the opener at 5-4 before forcing a tiebreaker. The Serbian took it 7-2 and took total command on Arthur Ashe to win in under two hours. ""Becker is a quality player and he should have won the first set. I was fortunate to come out of it, but after that I felt more comfortable on the court,"" said Djokovic. Defending champion Andy Murray of Britain was in action later Friday in a second round match against Leonardo Mayer of Argentina. Murray beat Djokovic in the men's final at Wimbledon but has struggled to find his best form in hard court warm up tournaments ahead of Flushing Meadows.","Sabine Lisicki exits U.S .Open to Ekaterina Makarova .

"Amsterdam (CNN) -- On November 2, 2004, Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh was bicycling to work in Amsterdam when he was shot eight times at close range. He died instantly, but in a fit of rage, his assailant, Dutch-Moroccan Mohammed Bouyeri, also attempted to cut off his head with a machete. Bouyeri killed van Gogh because of a short film he had recently produced with Somali-born Dutch politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali that criticized Islam's treatment of women. The film showed verses of the Quran projected onto the bodies of several naked young women. It was a film designed to provoke. And it did. Ali subsequently went into a self-imposed exile in the United States. News: Six things to know about the attack . Now, seven years later, a short, amateurish film entitled ""Innocence of Muslims,"" purportedly created by Sam Bacile in the U.S., portrays the Prophet Mohammed as a philandering child molester. (""Sam Bacile"" appears to be a pseudonym.) Terry Jones, a Christian pastor based in Florida who has a long history of making incendiary statements about Islam, is promoting ""Innocence of Muslims."" Jones also recently called for an ""International Judge Mohammed Day"" to be held on the 11th anniversary of 9/11, this past Tuesday. News about the film has sparked outrage in the Muslim world. Mobs have attacked American embassies and consulates in Egypt, Libya and Yemen. The U.S. ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens, and three of his staff members were killed in what appears to have been a well-organized attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on Tuesday. The attackers may have used the opportunity presented by the film protests to mount the assault. These attacks came after the accidental burning of Qurans by U.S. soldiers at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan in February sparked massive protests across the country, resulting in the deaths of at least 30 Afghans and six U.S. soldiers, all of whom were shot by men in Afghan security force uniforms. Opinion: Survivor of 1979 consulate attack -- Libya an eerie echo . And these are just the latest in a series of violent reactions to the perceived disrespect of the prophet and the Quran by Westerners -- sometimes intentional and sometimes unintentional -- that, in an increasingly globalized world of almost instantaneous communication, has intensified significantly during the past several years. And Muslim extremists as well as Christian fundamentalists in the West have increasingly intentionally amplified this trend. Politicians and the media in the Muslim world have also played an important, though perhaps unintended, role in stirring up violence in the wake of a number of these perceived attacks on Islam. A YouTube video of ""Innocence of Muslims"" that provoked the Libyan mob to attack the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was initially published in July, but it was not until versions of it dubbed in Arabic appeared online and were broadcast by religious Egyptian news channel al-Nas that protests sprouted in Egypt. A May 2005 Newsweek article claiming that American soldiers at Guantanamo had flushed a copy of the Quran down the toilet went unnoticed for nearly a week before Pakistani politician Imran Khan pointed the article out in a news conference. More than a dozen people were subsequently killed during protests in Afghanistan. (Newsweek later retracted the story.) Similarly, when Jones burned a copy of the Quran at his church on March 20, 2011, two weeks went by without any incident. But then President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan made a speech calling for his arrest. Within 24 hours, protesters stormed the United Nations compound in Mazar-e Sharif in northern Afghanistan, killing seven foreign employees, and demonstrations across the country killed more than a dozen other people. In 2005, the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published 12 cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, setting off a wave of protests and attacks over the next several years in which as many as 200 people have been killed. In 2008, for instance, al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Danish Embassy in Islamabad, which killed a half-dozen bystanders, saying the powerful suicide car bomb was in retaliation for the offensive cartoons. Two years later, Kurt Westergaard, one of the cartoonists, barely escaped from a Somali man linked to Al-Shabaab, al Qaeda's Somali affiliate, who broke into the cartoonist's home in Denmark with a knife and ax. But the violence sparked by the Jyllands-Posten cartoons, one of which depicted the Prophet Mohammed with a turban-wrapped bomb on his head, began a full four months after the images were published by the newspaper and were the result of a carefully orchestrated campaign by two Danish Muslim clerics who toured the Middle East, presenting a dossier about the cartoons to important religious and political figures. Opinion: Libya killings show U.S. at risk in Arab world . Included in the dossier were cartoons that had never appeared in the Jyllands-Posten newspaper, showing offensive images of the Prophet Mohammed. As a result, entering the Jyllands-Posten newspaper in Copenhagen today is akin to visiting a prison, with a heavily barred set of metal gates securing entrance to the building. And just as author Salman Rushdie remains under threat decades after the 1989 fatwa against him for his novel ""The Satanic Verses,"" so too the threat against Jyllands-Posten is likely to endure for many years. On Wednesday, Karzai released a public statement strongly condemning the recent ""criminal act."" This was not a reference to the assault on the U.S. consulate in Libya a day earlier that resulted in the four deaths there but to the release of ""Innocence of Muslims,"" the video that denigrates the Prophet Mohammed. News: Unanswered questions after the attack . Karzai did express his condolences about the deaths at the Libyan consulate when he spoke privately to President Obama. However, his public statement will surely draw attention to an issue that is likely to cause additional violent protests in Afghanistan, which NATO forces are steeling themselves for. With allies like these, who needs enemies?","Peter Bergen: Violence against U.S. over film is part of a pattern of incidents .

"(CNN) -- Less than a month after two lung transplant surgeries to save Sarah Murnaghan's life, the 10-year-old has developed pneumonia in her second set of replacement lungs, her mother posted on Monday. Sarah has developed pneumonia in her right lung, her mother, Janet Murnaghan posted on her Facebook page. Physicians believe it was caused by aspirations from her belly, she wrote, meaning contents from her stomach went through the wrong pipes and into her lungs. ""Yesterday was tough,"" Murnaghan wrote. ""Today she is more stable, but this is definitely a large set back."" The lungs were infected with pneumonia before they were implanted, but this is a new infection. Pneumonia is not uncommon after any type of lung surgery, CNN's Sanjay Gupta said. ""Sarah had an even higher increased risk because she's taking immune-suppressing drugs and because of her cystic fibrosis,"" Gupta said. ""But even with a setback like this infection, nearly 80% of people survive at least one year after lung transplant."" Sarah was born with cystic fibrosis. Her family pushed for a change national transplant policy as they fought for her to be eligible for adult lung donations. Her family had been told she had five weeks to live in May, and she had been on a transplant list for children's lungs for 18 months . After the Murnaghans petitioned, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network's executive committee approved a one-year change that makes children younger than 12 eligible to be on adult lung transplant priority lists. Sarah received her first transplant lungs June 12, one week after she became eligible for adult lungs. The donated lungs were poor quality, but the family proceeded with the surgery because ""Sarah was out of time to wait."" The lungs failed shortly afterward, and Sarah underwent emergency surgery to put her on a bypass machine to keep oxygen pumping through her body. She received a new set of lungs three days later. Family members knew the lungs were infected with pneumonia before the surgery, but they went ahead with the transplant because ""they were Sarah's best and only hope."" Despite the infection, her family had reported steady improvement up until Monday. In the same post, Janet Murnaghan thanks everyone for their thoughts and prayers. ""We have an amazing team of doctors who go above and beyond but also walk this road with us in such a kind and compassionate way,"" she wrote. ""Thankful to God for this day!""","Sarah Murnaghan developed pneumonia in her right lung, her mother posts .

"(CNN) -- U.S. sailors from a carrier strike group whose recent presence in the Persian Gulf drew the ire of Iranian military officials have rescued 13 of the Middle Eastern country's sailors from a hijacked fishing boat, a military spokesman said Friday. The destroyer USS Kidd came to the aid of the ship Thursday in the North Arabian sea, near the crucial Strait of Hormuz, according to the Navy. The rescue prompted the captain of the freed ship to offer his ""sincere gratitude,"" according to Josh Schminky, a Navy Criminal Investigative Service agent aboard the Kidd. ""He was afraid that without our help, they could have been there for months,"" Schminky said. The rescue Thursday came two days after Iran said the United States should not send any more warships into the Persian Gulf. The USS John Stennis Strike Group, which includes the Kidd, moved out of the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz last week, prompting Iranian Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi to warn that ""there is no need for the forces belonging to the countries beyond this region to have a presence in the Persian Gulf,"" according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. ""Their presence does nothing but create mayhem, and we never wanted them to be present in the Persian Gulf,"" Vahidi said. According to the Navy, a helicopter from the Kidd spotted a suspect pirate boat alongside the Iranian vessel. At the same time, the Kidd received a distress call from the captain of ship, the Al Molai, saying he and his crew were being held captive by pirates. A team from the Kidd boarded the Al Molai, took 15 suspected pirates into custody and freed 13 Iranian hostages, the Navy said. The suspected pirates, mostly Somalis, were taken to the Stennis to be held until a decision is made about prosecution, Pentagon spokesman Capt. John Kirby said Friday. Pirates hijacked the Al Molai 40 to 45 days ago, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said in a statement. The crew was ""held hostage, with limited rations and we believe were forced against their will to assist the pirates with other piracy operations,"" according to the statement. The Navy team provided food, water and medical care to both the suspected pirates and the crew of the Al Molai after securing the ship and ensuring everyone was safe, Schminky said. The crew had ""been through a lot,"" he said. ""We went out of our way to treat the fishing crew with kindness and respect,"" he said. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta called the USS Stennis later Friday to congratulate the strike group commander, Rear Adm. Craig Faller, and his team on a ""well executed effort,"" the Pentagon said. ""He said the team did exactly the right thing, and that he's proud of what they were able to do,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said in a release. He quoted Panetta as saying, ""When we get a distress signal, we're going to respond. That's the nature of what our country is all about.""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Acknowledging the toll the unrelenting nuclear crisis has had on people's lives and livelihoods, the owner of Japan's stricken nuclear plant has offered money to some of those in the radiation's reach -- an offer that one city decided to refuse. An official with Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, said Tuesday that the utility made a ""token"" offer to residents in 10 communities near the plant. Nuclear crisis explainer . Starting March 31, money began going out to those in nine of them. But the town of Namie rejected Tokyo Electric's offer, with a local official calling it too meager an attempt to make up for a drastically reduced quality of life and income. ""Our people are suffering, and unfortunately, everything we've built is gone,"" Mayor Tamotsu Baba told CNN. ""Where is our direct apology?"" Baba asked. ""Because the cash certainly doesn't amount to much."" Tokyo Electric says the amount is an initial token payment, not compensation for losses sustained as a result of the nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi. They promise that will come later -- after they have assessed the damage from the accident, which has spread radioactive contamination across much of the surrounding area. The company called the initial offer ""payment for their troubles,"" and would not detail how much money is being offered to each community. But Kousei Negishi, who is the manager of general affairs for Namie, said that it was 20 million yen -- about $12 for each of Namie's roughly 20,000 residents. That amount of cash, said Negishi, is ""not enough."" And it is logistically difficult to force local governments to distribute the money, which he said should be Tokyo Electric's responsibility. Several officials from Fukushima, the prefecture that includes the crippled plant, took their complaints about the company and the evacuation zone to Prime Minister Naoto Kan's Tokyo office Tuesday afternoon. ""We don't know if TEPCO understands what we're going through,"" said Katsuya Endo, the mayor of Tomioka, one of the towns that has been evacuated since the accident. Special coverage . The company said Tuesday that would be worked out between the power company and the Japanese government, which has pledged to support Japan's largest utility in the crisis. One week ago, a report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated Tokyo Electric will face compensation claims of 1 trillion Japanese yen (about $12.13 billion) if the recovery effort takes two months, the financial company's Tokyo spokesman Takayuki Inoue told CNN. That figure would rise to 2.4 trillion to 3 trillion yen if the process takes six months, and up to 10 trillion yen if the recovery takes two years, according to the report. Most likely, tens of thousands of people will have a legitimate claim to this cash. They'll include those who haven't been able to work, who have been forced out of their homes or who otherwise have had their lives turned upside down in the problem-plagued, complicated struggle to contain the emission of radiation into the air, ground and water from the Fukushima Daiichi plant. How to help . The government ordered about 78,000 people who lived within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the plant to evacuate, due to high air and ground radiation readings in those locales. Another 62,000 lived within 20 to 30 kilometers (12 to 19 miles) -- the so-called exclusion zone, where people have been told to stay indoors -- an official from Kan's office said. Namie is located just outside this 30-kilometer radius. Interactive map . Thousands of others have been affected by the crisis. They include fishermen, who have been told not to go within 20 kilometers of the plant and are facing consumers skeptical about the safety of local seafood, especially after authorities announced plans to dump 11,500 tons of radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean. Farmers, too, have been hit hard by restrictions on the sale and distribution of certain crops because of radiation readings exceeding government limits. Tokyo Electric itself has suffered as well. The company has admitted it's been inundated by 40,000 public complaints daily coming into its offices, its stock has plummeted and its faced several protests, including one Sunday in downtown Tokyo that drew about 250 people. Last week, Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata acknowledged the financial difficulties and reports that Japan's government is considering nationalizing the company. ""(But) we want to make every effort to stay a private company,"" he said.","NEW: ""Everything we've built is gone,"" the mayor of Namie says .

"Editor's note: Since the FBI arrested a Brooklyn businessman in late July on federal charges of organ trafficking, CNN has been conducting a worldwide investigation into the sale of kidneys using willing donors and willing recipients from China to Israel to the United States. Nick Rosen says he got $20,000 to donate his kidney and lied to the hospital's transplant team. TEL AVIV, Israel (CNN) -- Four years ago, a young, cash-starved Israeli answered an ad in a newspaper for a kidney donor. ""I decided I wanted to make a positive change in my life and do something different,"" Nick Rosen told CNN. ""So I saw an ad in the paper and it said, 'Kidney Donor Wanted.' And called the ad in the paper, and they asked me my blood type."" Ultimately, Rosen flew to New York and underwent surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center to remove one of his two healthy kidneys. ""Let's say I donated a kidney and received compensation,"" he said. Rosen's story is one of several that have come to light in recent weeks as part of a worldwide CNN investigation into what appears to be a widespread black market in human organs currently under scrutiny by authorities in the United States and Israel. Rosen says he was paid $20,000 for his kidney -- something he admits he lied about in interviews with the hospital's transplant team. Watch Rosen explain how he sold his kidney » . What Rosen did -- and what the man who received the kidney did -- violated a 1994 U.S. federal law that forbids the selling or purchase of live organs for cash. He not only got his money, but made an 11-minute documentary film he called ""Kidney Beans"" to show how easy it was to sell an organ. A portion of the documentary shows him lying on a bed, covered in cash he says he was paid. In a written statement, Mount Sinai told CNN: ""The pre-transplant evaluation may not detect premeditated and skillful attempts to subvert and defraud the evaluation process."" ""Mount Sinai's transplant screening process is rigorous and comprehensive, and assesses each donor's motivation,"" the hospital said. A hospital medical source put it more bluntly: ""We were duped."" According to kidney transplant doctors, the process of pre-screening, blood-type matching and other related medical issues normally takes two months before any surgery. During that time, both recipient and doctor have to make several visits to a team of doctors, social workers and perhaps even ethicists before a final decision is made. Hospitals often ask donors to sign documents which ask whether they have received any compensation for donating a kidney or other organ. But no documentation is required to prove a family connection. The chief of nephrology at Mount Sinai later said hospitals and doctors are primarily concerned with medicine. ""We're not detectives. We're not the FBI,"" Dr. Barbara Murphy said. ""People can, on occasion, deceive us."" But what Rosen did was not unique, according to the World Health Organization, which says 10 percent of kidney transplants worldwide are believed to be illicit. Dr. Eli A. Friedman, a leading kidney specialist, teacher and researcher at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, said the United States leads the world in kidney transplants. About 16,000 of them are performed every year, he said. ""That would mean that somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 transplants in the United States might fall in the categorization of being illegal,"" Friedman said. He added, ""I have had several experiences with patients with data that says they got a kidney from their brother, their sister or from their parent when they don't have a brother or a sister, "" Dr. Friedman told CNN. "" The transplant was performed under false circumstances."" And Friedman said he's been offered bribes of $5,000 to $10,000 by kidney brokers. ""Of course I was very happy to see them leave the office very rapidly,"" he said. The extent of the underground network came to the surface in late July, when FBI agents arrested a Brooklyn businessman on charges of organ trafficking. A federal complaint against Itzhak-Levy Rosenbaum said he had offered to provide a new kidney for a relative of an undercover FBI agent for about $160,000. According to the complaint, Rosenbaum told the agent he could buy the kidney for about $5,000 and gave instructions on exact procedures and methods to avoid detection. The complaint quoted Rosenbaum as bragging: ""So far, I've never had a failure."" Ronald Kleinberg, the attorney for Rosenbaum, told CNN he could not comment on the FBI complaint ""because I have not had enough time to assess the information."" He said CNN's ""assertions are incorrect,"" and that law enforcement's account of Rosenbaum's network was inaccurate. But law enforcement sources said Rosenbaum had been the centerpiece of a kidney-for-sale operation, which he called ""United Lifeline,"" that operated extensively for nearly a decade. The donors and patients in this network were linked by one common theme -- they were Jewish. Investigators say the donors usually came from Eastern Europe, were mostly poor and willing to sell their kidneys to U.S. and Israeli patients. According to one expert on organ trafficking, the FBI had been alerted to Rosenbaum's activities years ago. Nancy Scheper-Hughes, an anthropologist at the University of California at Berkeley and founder of a newsletter called ""Organs Watch,"" said she had told the FBI about Rosenbaum and her suspicions about him seven years ago. ""I think they thought it was a very few bad apples,"" Scheper-Hughes said. The FBI said would not officially comment on her assertions, but an FBI source later said, ""We developed our own leads."" According to Scheper-Hughes, the same day she spoke to CNN, she had learned of another illegal transplant surgery taking place at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. The donor, she said, was a young Korean national who had received more than $25,000 for one of his kidneys. ""This is a kid that does not speak much English, who is terrified and shaken,"" she said. ""And he thought, 'Maybe I've made a mistake to do this, but $25,000 is a good amount of cash.'"" Scheper-Hughes said the cash had been handed over in two increments, with the second paid to a relative in a hospital bathroom. In a statement, Cedars-Sinai spokeswoman Sally Stewart said living donors ""must state they are not receiving payment for their kidney."" ""If at any time during the evaluation process, the transplant team suspects the donor is inappropriately being paid for a kidney, the transplant is canceled,"" she said. But a hospital source later told CNN, ""We do not give lie-detector tests to our patients."" According to Scheper-Hughes, who is in the final stages of writing a book on organ trafficking, much of the world's illicit traffic in kidneys can be traced to Israel. ""Israel is the top,"" she said. ""It has tentacles reaching out worldwide."" Until March 2008, Israeli law allowed Israeli citizens to go abroad for live organ transplants from non-related donors. But there was no way for Israeli authorities to keep track of how many of those cases involved money changing hands, the country's Health Ministry said. Israeli investigators are looking intensively at illegal organ trafficking under the new law, the ministry said. And prosecutors in Nazareth sent nine Israelis to jail in 2007 after uncovering a black-market ring that was buying and selling organs. Gilad Ehrlick, the assistant district attorney for Israel's Northern District, said he was shocked by the case. Secretly recorded conversations showed that Arab and Russian newspapers were targeting low-income Israelis and Palestinians with ads saying there would be payment in exchange for providing a kidney. ""The idea was the people were calling out of despair, out of urgent need who needed a quick way to make money,"" he said.","CNN investigating what appears to be a widespread black market in human organs .

"(CNN) -- A New York airport screener who removed two pipes from a traveler's bag and set them aside Monday morning prompted a security scare six hours later when the next shift saw the pipes and feared they might be pipe bombs, local and federal officials said. The incident at New York's LaGuardia Airport began at 11:30 a.m. when a screener discovered unidentifiable items inside a passenger's carry-on bag. The officer screened the item for explosives, determined them not to be a threat and cleared the passenger through the checkpoint, a Transportation Security Administration official said. But the officer prevented the metal item from going through because of its ""material and appearance,"" a TSA official said. When the next shift arrived, one officer saw the items and mistakenly believed they were test objects, used to check screener proficiency. When that officer later learned they were not test items, the officer alerted others, and the TSA contacted the Port Authority Police Department, responsible for protecting the airport. ""No one could give a good account of what it was, so we did the safe thing and called (the) NYPD bomb squad,"" Port Authority Police Department spokesman Al Della Fave told CNN. The bomb squad removed the devices at 5:30 p.m. -- six hours after they were taken from the passenger. The devices were taken to a remote location for examination or disposal, one official said. ""We have still not been told what it was or what it was composed of,"" Della Fave said. Several law enforcement sources told CNN the objects were determined to be homeopathic medical devices. TSA officials said the checkpoint was not closed, nor was the terminal evacuated, during the incident. The bomb squad was called ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the TSA said. Port authority spokesman Della Fave said the police force will ""speak with their (TSA) supervisors to determine how or why this breakdown in communications took place so it won't happen again."" CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","A TSA officer coming on duty spotted two devices .

"Montevista, Philippines (CNN) -- Bent over amid the wreckage of her family's home, Jane Bucani, 17, leafs through the sodden remnants of her school yearbook, trying to see what memories she can salvage. Her mother, Rosal, picks among the jumble of debris where her kitchen used to be. The broken appliances strewn across the floor are the only indication that this was where she would cook for her five children. And they are some of the more fortunate ones. Up and down the poor, remote Compostela Valley region on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, families like the Bucanis are trying to come to terms with what hit them. Thousands of flimsy houses have been ripped to shreds. Scores of people are dead. Hundreds more are still missing, swept away in flash floods that roared down from the hills. In some places, mudcaked corpses line the streets, covered with cloths and palm leaves. Distraught relatives wail and tug at one another's clothes. Rescuers struggle to aid Philippines storm victims . The merciless force that tore apart lives in the valley and elsewhere in eastern Mindanao was Typhoon Bopha, known locally as ""Pablo,"" the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the island in decades. Rosal Bucani, 48, who lives in the town of Montevista, said she had never experienced anything like it. She didn't hear the warnings to take refuge in evacuation centers. Many of those who did failed to heed them. The area is sheltered from the worst of the weather by mountains, they figured. And besides, the big typhoons that slam into the Philippines every year never come this far south, especially not this late in the year. But Bopha did. And it brought savage winds that uprooted entire banana plantations in low-lying areas, and relentless rain that unleashed torrents of rocks and mud down the mountainsides where shanty-dwelling miners dig for gold. The epicenter of the devastation appears to have been in New Bataan, a town about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of Montevista and close to the steep mountains. The flash floods hit it head-on Tuesday, washing away families huddled in their homes and soldiers stationed in a compound in the town. Large parts of New Bataan and many of the people who lived there are now buried under mud, fallen trees and rubble, said Arnaldo Arcadio, an emergency response program manager for Catholic Relief Services, a humanitarian group. ""The mood is really gloomy,"" he said Thursday after visiting the town, where 90% to 95% of the houses are believed to have been destroyed or damaged. At least 142 people from New Bataan have died -- 110 of whom hadn't been identified as of Friday morning -- Philippine authorities say. And with more than 340 others still unaccounted for in the town, the grim math of natural disasters suggests the death toll will rise further. Residents who evaded death now lack food, shelter and, most of all, drinking water, since the nearest source is 5 kilometers away, according to Arcadio. ""They are just trying to survive,"" he said, noting that the knee-deep mud in many places made it difficult to get around, with several areas of the town completely inaccessible. Philippine President Benigno Aquino III will visit New Bataan on Friday to assess the damage and oversee the distribution of relief goods, the official Philippine News Agency reported. ""I have Mindanao on my mind, especially the number of people missing,"" Aquino said Thursday. ""I am hoping these people will be found safe and sound."" The president said he is saddened that some families will spend the holidays in evacuation centers because their homes were destroyed. Rescue workers have been struggling to reach many of the worst affected areas in Compostela Valley and the neighboring Davao Oriental region. Landslides have blocked roads and knocked out power and communications. Bopha raked across Mindanao and several other Philippine islands before moving off into the South China Sea. It has caused at least 418 deaths in the country, left about a quarter of a million homeless and affected more than 5 million people overall, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, the Philippines' emergency management agency, reported Friday morning. Some 383 people are missing and 445 are injured, the agency said. The typhoon arrived just ahead of a sinister anniversary on Mindanao. A year ago, Tropical Storm Washi drenched northern areas of the island with heavy rain, setting off flash floods and landslides in the middle of the night that destroyed entire villages. Washi, dubbed ""Sendong"" in the Philippines, killed more than 1,200 people and left painful memories in the hardest hit areas, Cagayan de Oro and Iligan City. The approach this week of Bopha, a far more powerful storm than Washi, had residents fearing fresh devastation. Local authorities took preemptive action, relocating thousands of people to evacuation centers and setting up emergency supplies. But in the end, northern Mindanao was spared the worst of Bopha's fury. It was the less prepared communities of Compostela Valley and Davao Oriental, further south and east, that bore the brunt. An ethnically mixed area, the Compostela Valley was inhabited by a multitude of tribes until the 20th century, when a logging boom brought waves of migrants from further north in the Philippines. The timber trade, and later the mining industry, changed the geological and demographic landscape, stripping away the forests and driving many tribes into the hills. The valley is also known for its rich, fertile plain, where rice, corn, bananas and coconuts are grown. But on Thursday, the headline of the Philippine Star, a national newspaper, gave it a new, grim title: ""Valley of the dead."" If you are there, share your story . CNN's Liz Neisloss reported from Montevista, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. Elizabeth Joseph and Michael Pearson also contributed to this report.","At least 418 people have died as a result of Typhoon Bopha, Filipino officials say .

"(Budget Travel) -- If the best architecture aims at eternity, to paraphrase famed English architect Christopher Wren, then these new hotels are bound to be immortal. The 11 hotels on our list all opened within the last four years, and each is an example of awe-inspiring design in its own right. You can stay in a wave-like skyscraper in Chicago, a stack of cantilevered cubes in Portugal, or a hotel tucked into the wild cliffs of an Australian island. And, even better, it won't cost a fortune to spend a night in these architectural wonders. Seven of the 11 are under $200 a night. See more photos of the hotels . Bella Sky Comwell (Copenhagen, Denmark) The two structures that make up the Bella Sky each incline at a slightly different angle. Or as the architects sweetly put it, the towers are drawn to each other, ""yet seem a little shy."" In fact, the creative use of angles is employed both inside the property and out -- geometric angles give the exterior a filigreed look, while inside the hotel there are rooms where there are no 90-degrees at all (there are over 200 different room shapes in the 812-room hotel). The location, in the Copenhagen neighborhood of Orestad five miles from the city center, actually inspired the leaning-tower design. The buildings are so close to the airport that height restrictions dictate that they must not exceed 246 feet. 011-45/3247-3000, bellaskycomwell.dk, from $155 per night. Jumeirah at Etihad Towers Hotel (Abu Dhabi) Queensland architecture firm DBI Design won the World's Leading New Hotel Award for 2011 for this stunning $1 billion residential and retail center. The complex is made up of five towers on a beachside stretch on a peninsula in Abu Dhabi. Constructing the buildings that now dominate the modern skyline posed structural challenges. The towers all curve, meaning each floor slab is a different shape. The 382-room Jumeirah hotel takes up 66 stories of one of the towers. 888/645-5697, jumeirah.com, from $192 per night. Budget Travel: 12 elevators you have to see to believe . Hotel Consolación (Teruel, Spain) Perched atop a ridge, this collection of 10 freestanding, wood-clad modernist cubes, or ""Kube"" suites, opened in 2009. Located in the rural mountain town of Teruel (a three-hour drive from both Barcelona and Valencia), the sleek cubes create a beautiful juxtaposition with the groves of olive and almond trees that surround them. Each suite has a sliding glass wall that opens onto a private terrace, and, inside, sparse interiors combine slate, copper-treated pine, and metal sheeting. The hotel incorporates some classic elements as well: a converted 14th-century hermitage serves as a communal area for guests. 011-34-978/85-67-55, consolacion.com.es, from $185 per night. Southern Ocean Lodge (Kangaroo Island, Australia) Architect Max Pritchard designed this lodge to blend into the dramatic surroundings of Kangaroo Island. Tucked back behind cliffs, the hotel opened in 2008 and consists of 21 suites cascading down a windswept slope, following the natural curve of the land, each with floor-to-ceiling glass walls and sweeping views of the Southern Ocean. Suites were constructed from lightweight materials -- steel screw piles, timber framing, iron cladding -- that could be carried in to create minimal disturbance to nature, and which also could handle the challenge of building on precarious soil conditions (several feet of sand atop solid limestone). Inside are environmentally sound sandblasted limestone floors and recycled spotted-gum walls. The off-the-grid location led to innovations such as sculptural containers for collecting rainwater. 931/924-5253, southernoceanlodge.com.au, from $1,000 per person, per night with a two-night minimum . Marina Bay Sands (Singapore) This trio of 55-story towers opened in 2010 and hold an incredible 2,561 hotel rooms, plus a museum, casino, convention center, waterfront promenade, shops, and restaurants. Architect Moshe Safdie has said that his challenge ""was to create a vital public place at the district-urban scale-in other words, to address the issue of megascale and invent an urban landscape that would work at the human scale."" His way of dealing with that was to design the complex around two central axes to give a sense of orientation. The towers are connected at the top by the cantilevered, two-and-a-half-acre SkyPark, home to gardens, 250 trees, a public observatory and a 492-foot swimming pool -- all perched high in the sky like a fantastical cruise ship forever suspended in midair. 011-65/6688-8868, marinabaysands.com, from $350 per night. Budget Travel: World's 16 most picturesque villages . Yas Viceroy Hotel (Abu Dhabi) This 499-room hotel was the first to be built straddling a Formula 1 racetrack (it opened in 2009 and was renovated in 2011 to become a Viceroy). The structure consists of a pair of 12-story towers joined by a sweeping, 700-foot curvilinear skin of glass and steel -- actually 5,800 pivoting, diamond-shaped glass panels that reflect the sky by day and are illuminated up by an LED system at night. The architects' aim was to reflect artistry and geometries associated with ancient Islamic art and craft traditions, and from a distance the panels create the appearance of a spectacular veil. 888/622-4567, viceroyhotelsandresorts.com; from about $210 per night. Radisson Blu Waterfront Hotel (Stockholm, Sweden) The piece de resistance at this 414-room hotel of white polished stone and rough black stone is its attached conference center -- a glass structure with an exterior made up of 13 miles of semi-transparent stainless steel rods. They reflect the sky and water, radically change the skyline, and are what architect Hans Forsmark describes as ""a reminiscence of the Nordic Light."" The interiors of the hotel, which opened in 2011, follow straight lines and geometric precision. 800/333-3333, radissonblu.com, from $155 per night. Axis Viana Hotel (Viana do Castelo, Portugal) The 88-room Axis Viana Hotel was a striking addition to the folkloric village of Viana do Castelo when it opened in 2008. The exterior is made up of reflective aluminum, black glass, and green stone, and the cantilevered design changes the shape of the hotel depending upon your vantage point. The contrasting interior consists of white finishes and materials including wood and stone. It's all edged by a shimmering outdoor pool and surrounded by views of the Lima River and Mount St. Luzia. 011-351/258-802-000, axishoteis.com, from $100 per night. Hôtel Americano (New York, New York) The 10-story Americano sits on the site of a former parking garage in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. Neighbors were likely pleased with the swap when the hotel opened in 2011. The building looks like a massive metal sculpture -- perfect for the gallery-filled neighborhood -- with floors connected by catwalks and wrapped with stainless-steel mesh. The industrial façade holds 56 rooms plus two restaurants, a lobby café and two basement bars; for urban escape, there is a roof deck with a pool, bar, and peaceful garden terrace. 212/216-0000, hotel-americano.com, from $295 per night. Budget Travel: 12 hot springs worth traveling for . Miura Hotel (Celadná, Czech Republic) Rising like a geometric spaceship in the Beskydy Mountains is this distinctive hotel made of concrete, sheet metal, violet glass, Corian, and stone. Miura opened in 2011 and is divided into three parts, one of which seems to levitate above the ground, plus two side wings containing the 44 rooms. The arrangement means that all of the rooms have views of the surrounding mountains. The striking hotel also has an impressive art collection, with works by Andy Warhol, Damien Hirst, and Czech sculptor David Černý. Known for his large-scale installations, Černý's works here include an almost 30-foot-tall stainless-steel man pushing against the exterior of the hotel. 011-420/558-761-100, www.miura.cz, from $126 per night. Radisson Blu Aqua Hotel (Chicago, Illinois) Architect Jeanne Gang literally made waves in a city full of iconic skyscrapers with her showstopper building. The 82-story glass structure's exterior has undulating concrete balconies resembling the swirls and ripples of nearby Lake Michigan. Such a unique design brought with it a unique construction challenge -- each floor plate is a different shape, which means a different concrete pour was required for every story. To manage it, the concrete was poured into a specially designed flexible metal edge that was reused over and over again -- an important detail for green architecture. Much of the building is designated for private residences, but the 334-room Radisson Blu Aqua opened on 18 floors in November 2011. 312/565-5258, radissonbluchicago.com, from $175 per night.

"(CNN) -- The day my daughter Marley was born, I went straight to the nursery and held her for well over two hours. I just held her and cried because I had never experienced such a love for anyone or anything in my life. I think the nurses thought I was crazy because eventually they told me I needed to go be with my wife. Three days later, before we left the hospital, the pediatric doctor told us she thought Marley might have Down syndrome. My reaction: Are you freaking kidding me? I immediately had a panic attack and was taken to the emergency room. Thoughts were racing through my mind: How could my perfect daughter have Down syndrome? How could they not know for sure? How could the general ultrasound, which said we had a 1-in-18,000 chance of having a child with Down syndrome, be wrong? Why was God punishing me? How could I live with a daughter that was going to be rejected by everyone ... including myself? I entered into a deep depression for the first year of Marley's life. My wife became concerned about me, so I started taking antidepressants and seeing a counselor. I contemplated leaving my wife, or giving my daughter up for adoption, and suicide. I would lie awake at night thinking about my future, and searching for a reason to live. I believed all the negative things the world told me about Down syndrome, and viewed it as a curse on my family. The entire time, I couldn't stop thinking about how this would change my life! Read Barr's original post on CNN iReport . But the truth is, I felt badly about myself. At one point, I wrote a letter to myself asking why things had to be this way. I prayed for God to take my worthless life in exchange for removing Marley's extra chromosome. I would even quietly lie awake at night contemplating how I would feel if she suddenly stopped breathing while she slept. Finally, one Saturday morning, when Marley was about 2 months old, I got up and told my wife I was going for a walk. I had no intention of coming back. I was going to leave my wife and daughter. I couldn't do it anymore. But then, after I left, I started having second thoughts, and that's when I remembered that my wife had signed up for an online support group. I ended up spending the next two hours talking on the phone about my daughter and family with a man I had never met. He had a 2-year-old with Down syndrome. I cannot explain it, but after talking to him for two hours I had the strength to go home and face another day. For the next six months, I got up and faced one day at a time. Years ago, my father said to me, ""If you want to fix a problem, then do something about it."" I followed his advice. First, I tried to gain as much knowledge as I could about raising a child with Down syndrome. Next, I started calling every family I could find that had a child with Down syndrome. I owe a great deal to these families because they were willing to talk to me despite the 12-hour time difference between Bangkok and the States. I also started forcing myself to interact with my daughter. She was desperate for me to start loving her, and she continued loving me until I broke down and did the same. I was scared to accept my daughter because that would mean accepting her disability. But the reality was the only thing keeping me from loving my daughter was my own ignorance. Once I overcame my own selfish expectations for my daughter, I slowly began to see the beautiful girl that would change my life forever. Mom: Down syndrome doesn't change my dreams . And finally, I talked to God. I talked to Him just like He was sitting in a chair beside me because that was the true barrier in my life. I was honest with God throughout the entire process, and that is when I started finding peace. Healing is a process and a journey. I would have never experienced this life-changing transformation if Marley had not been born. It is true, there are difficult times having a daughter with Down syndrome. But it also true that she is very much like any other child. Marley smiles, laughs, plays, is able to meet many developmental milestones (albeit her own pace, with her own style), makes mistakes, and, most importantly, completes our family. She literally brightens my day every time I see her. She's now 2 years old, and at this age all children develop at different rates. Marley can walk; swim; sign and speak words; throw and kick a ball; follow simple directions and throw tantrums. She also knows how to manipulate her grandparents. But she has not learned how to run or jump. She is taking thyroid medication and has a small heart defect. The key is, she is very similar to most toddlers her age and every child with Down syndrome is different just like every child is different. Before our summer break, she passed an entrance exam to start at a British preschool in September with her peers who are not labeled as ""special-needs children."" In my opinion, these limitations we put on children with Down syndrome are outdated and lead to a lack of acceptance in our society. The medical community focuses on so many of the challenges associated with Down syndrome that we develop an unnecessary fear -- but these are only differences. The truth is, I am a better person today because of my daughter, my daughter who has Down syndrome. I am thankful for a wife that was willing to push me to change, and support me when I struggled. Want to respond, or got a story to share? Write a personal essay . Mostly, I thank God for Marley. I remember praying while waiting those first two weeks to get her confirmed diagnosis: ""God, if you heal my daughter, then I will give up my own salvation."" God didn't need my salvation -- that was a gift from him to me, just like Marley is a gift to us. The reality is that I am still saddened that Marley has Down syndrome, but I am beginning to realize that God can bless us regardless of our circumstances. I will never be able to fully understand why Marley has Down syndrome, but I do know she has made a difference in my life, my wife's life, and in the lives of so many in our community.

"(CNN) -- The new iPad may be a hot item in more ways than one. In the five days since the popular tablet went on sale, Apple comment boards have filled with anecdotal reports from owners who say the back of the device grows uncomfortably warm to the touch, especially in the bottom left-hand corner when held in portrait mode. ""Both my wife and I upgraded from iPad 1 to the new iPad,"" wrote a user named dhcwh on Apple's site. ""Not happy about the uncomfortable warmth of the new iDud. Not hot, just annoyingly warm. Seriously considering returning both."" ""Mine is also getting pretty hot,"" said another user, malageno, who bought a 32-gigabyte Wi-Fi model. ""It's not too hot to hold yet, but it seems to be getting hotter the more it's on."" A user named Limitin added, ""My new iPad is also overheating, bottom left like everyone else. The screen is great, but the heat is near unbearable at times and makes my hands sweaty while holding it."" Research by Consumer Reports appears to bear this out. Using a thermal-imaging camera, Consumer Reports engineers recorded temperatures as high as 116 degrees Fahrenheit -- up to 13 degrees higher than the iPad 2 -- on the new iPad while playing a video game, ""Infinity Blade II."" In a preliminary review last week, Consumer Reports had said the new iPad ""is shaping up to be the best tablet we've ever tested."" Many owners of the third-generation iPad have reported no problems, however. And the issue doesn't seem to have cooled interest in the tablet, which features a sharper screen and a more powerful processor than previous iPads. Apple announced Monday it has already sold more than 3 million of the new devices. In a statement Tuesday, Apple said, ""The new iPad delivers a stunning Retina display, A5X chip, support for 4G LTE plus 10 hours of battery life, all while operating well within our thermal specifications. If customers have any concerns they should contact AppleCare."" In its tech specs for the iPad, Apple says the device is not meant to be operated in temperatures greater than 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Some observers, including an unnamed Apple store employee in suburban Los Angeles, have attributed the warmth to the iPad's new battery, which is larger than in previous models. Others blame the device's larger graphics chip, which helps it run video games. Some iPad owners said they returned their devices to Apple stores and exchanged them for new ones. Others said the problem went away after they drained the iPad battery completely and then recharged it. Still others suggested reports of the problem were overblown. ""Personally I think a lot of people are blowing the heat problem ... out of proportion,"" a user named DaveBLondon said. ""Yes it gets hot, but is it too hot that it will burn you? No."" Another user, jimpal, said, ""Yes, it's warmer than the previous iPads. But, what would anyone expect with so much going on in there? It has spectacular graphics, is faster, and has a huge battery. Any form of computer runs hotter when it is doing more."" It's not the first time consumers have grumbled about Apple products overheating, especially when used in direct sunlight. Scattered similar complaints surfaced about the original iPad and the iPad 2, which did little to dent their popularity. Apple has sold more than 55 million iPads since the device went on sale in April 2010.","Some owners of the new iPad complain the device becomes uncomfortably hot during use .

Norman Schwarzkopf, who led allied forces to a routing of Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf War and became one of the nation's most celebrated military heroes of the era, died Thursday, a U.S. defense official said. He was 78. The death of the retired four-star Army general was confirmed by Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who described Schwarzkopf as ""one of the great military giants of the 20th century."" President Barack Obama called the death of Schwarzkopf a loss of an ""American original."" ""From his decorated service in Vietnam to the historic liberation of Kuwait and his leadership of United States Central Command, General Schwarzkopf stood tall for the country and Army he loved,"" Obama said. ""Our prayers are with the Schwarzkopf family, who tonight can know that his legacy will endure in a nation that is more secure because of his patriotic service."" Virtually unknown to the public before the Persian Gulf War, Schwarzkopf became a household name while he oversaw the buildup of 700,000 coalition troops, including more than 540,000 U.S. forces, after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The war began on January 17, 1991, with the start of the nearly six-week air campaign against Iraq that was followed by a 100-hour ground offensive that pushed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's forces out of Kuwait. A Time magazine correspondent described the general, as he prepared his troops along the Kuwaiti border, as a man ""with a John Wayne swagger and a growl like a grizzly."" Schwarzkopf, dubbed ""Stormin' Norman"" by his troops because of his reported temper, captured the public's imagination with his plain, frank talk about the war's progress. He once told a room full of reporters: ""As far as Saddam Hussein being a great military strategist, he is neither a strategist, nor is he schooled in the operational arts, nor is he a tactician, nor is he a general, nor is he a soldier. Other than that, he's a great military man, I want you to know that."" Former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and, therefore, Schwarzkopf's commander, said the general's leadership during the war inspired the nation. "" 'Stormin' Norman' led the coalition forces to victory, ejecting the Iraqi Army from Kuwait and restoring the rightful government,"" Powell said in a statement. ""His leadership not only inspired his troops, but also inspired the nation. He was a good friend of mine, a close buddy. I will miss him."" Schwarzkopf, a highly decorated Vietnam War veteran, ushered in a new era for the U.S. military, whose exploits were broadcast live around the clock. After the war, he was featured in his desert fatigues on the cover of nearly every major American magazine, and he joined thousands of troops for a welcome-home ticker tape parade in New York City. England's Queen Elizabeth II made him an honorary knight, and he received a standing ovation from Congress upon his return to the United States. Former President George H.W. Bush, who is hospitalized, said the general ""epitomized the 'duty, service, country' creed that has defended our freedom and seen this great nation through our most trying international crises."" ""More than that, he was a good and decent man -- and a dear friend,"" Bush said in a statement released by his office. While Schwarzkopf's leadership was heralded, critics raised questions about the decision to quickly end the ground war in Iraq and leave Hussein in power. Schwarzkopf was heavily criticized in the Thomas E. Ricks book ""The Generals: American Military Command from World War II to Today"" for allowing Iraq to use helicopters in no-fly zones established after the war. Iraq used the helicopters to put down a Shiite uprising that had been openly encouraged by the United States. Schwarzkopf told CNN's Larry King in a September 1992 interview that the preferred plan with Iraq was to avoid ever having to invade. ""We never wanted a war,"" he said. ""Once the war started, we were hoping that ... they'd come to their senses and stop right then. ... After 38 days, we got to a point where we could launch the ground war and, by that time, they hadn't withdrawn."" While his role in the Gulf War made him famous, Schwarzkopf told King, war itself and the bloodshed that went with it didn't appeal to him. ""I hate war. Absolutely, I hate war,"" he said. ""Good generalship is a realization that ... you've got to try and figure out how to accomplish your mission with a minimum loss of human life."" In his autobiography, ""It Doesn't Take A Hero,"" Schwarzkopf outlined the reasons that coalition forces didn't press on to the Iraqi capital during the first Gulf War. ""Had the United States and the United Kingdom gone on alone to capture Baghdad, under the provisions of the Geneva and Hague conventions we would have been considered occupying powers and therefore would have been responsible for all the costs of maintaining or restoring government, education and other services for the people of Iraq."" Schwarzkopf wrote that had ""we taken all of Iraq, we would have been like a dinosaur in the tar pit -- we would still be there, and we, not the United Nations, would be bearing the costs of that occupation."" Schwarzkopf supported the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, though he later criticized the Pentagon for what he called mistakes that included sending undertrained Reserve and National Guard troops into combat. Schwarzkopf retired in August 1991, hit the lecture circuit and briefly was a military analyst for NBC. He told King that he was asked to run for U.S. Senate. ""I got off the airplane and they came after me to, you know, run for senator in Florida, and I told them, 'No,' "" he said. ""I'm not a politician. I'd make a lousy politician."" Born in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1934, he was named H. Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. after his father. His father, Major Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, a West Point graduate who fought in World War I, became head of New Jersey State Police, helping to build the fledgling force and eventually leading the investigation of the infamous Lindbergh baby kidnapping. ""The day I was born, my father said ... 'That boy is going to West Point,' "" Schwarzkopf recalled to King. ""And that's the only thing I ever heard my entire young life."" After World War II, according to the book, the younger Schwarzkopf traveled to Iran to be with his father, who was helping advise the training of the country's police force under the shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Schwarzkopf attended a Swiss boarding school and later returned to the New York region to enroll at West Point before heading to Vietnam for the first time in 1966. ""I prided myself on being unflappable even in the most chaotic of circumstances,"" he wrote. ""That guise lasted until Vietnam, where I realized that I was dealing with human lives and if one were lost, it could never be replaced. I quickly learned that there was nothing wrong with being emotional."" He was commissioned a second lieutenant and served two tours of duty in Vietnam, where he received three Silver Stars. In 1983, he led troops during the invasion of Grenada. Schwarzkopf, who died in Tampa, Florida, is survived by his wife, Brenda, two daughters and a son. CNN's Barbara Starr, David Ariosto, Carma Hassan and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Colin Powell says Schwarzkopf's leadership inspired a nation .

"London (CNN) -- Royal watchers eagerly await the arrival of a child who will be heir to the British throne. Here's what you need to know and the latest developments: . • The appearance of a couple looking very like William and Catherine outside the hospital where she is expected to give birth provided a moment of excitement -- but it was a stunt organized by The Sun, Britain's best-selling tabloid newspaper. • As the wait for the royal baby continues, so does the debate over the Duchess of Cambridge's actual due date. Britain's Telegraph newspaper reports Friday, citing ""well-placed sources,"" that medical staff at St. Mary's Hospital -- where Catherine is expected to give birth -- were told the due date was July 19. • A royal source told CNN that her due date was July 13. She and Prince William announced at the start of the year that the baby was due in July, but did not announce the date. Why are some babies overdue? • The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth in the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital, next to Paddington Station in London. It's where William was born, as was his brother Harry. Catherine's mother, Carole Middleton, is likely to be on hand at the hospital. • Could the world's media be camped outside the wrong hospital, though? The Telegraph reported that a contingency plan is in place for Catherine to give birth at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, if she goes into labor while staying at her parents' home in Berkshire, and its swift progress means the journey back to London is impractical. • There's no doubting the media interest in the royal birth. The Sun newspaper is streaming live video of the entrance to the Lindo Wing, as is Stylist magazine. The days-long vigil outside the hospital has also inspired a spew of #GreatKateWait tweets from the waiting media pack -- as rounded up by New York Magazine. • One person who won't be at the Lindo Wing is Home Secretary Theresa May. Asked by a fellow lawmaker whether she would be attending the royal birth, as was formerly customary, she replied: ""In fact, it is no longer the case that the home secretary is required to attend a royal birth. The tradition -- now defunct -- goes back many centuries, she said, explaining that ""the home secretary had to be there to evidence that it was genuinely a royal birth and that a baby hadn't been smuggled in."" • Some people are thinking further ahead already. An Ipsos Mori poll released Thursday revealed almost two-thirds of those surveyed think William and Catherine's child should have a normal job before taking on royal duties. One in five disagrees. However, 70% of those polled think that it is impossible for the children of royalty to have a normal upbringing. The same survey found support for Britain's monarchy remains high, with more than three-quarters in favor of a monarchy over a republic. • There's been plenty of speculation about the baby's name -- and betting is going strong. The famous Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in London, which takes in and finds homes for lost and unwanted pets, has gone a step further and named a litter of kittens after the bookies' favorites: Alexandra, Charlotte, Elizabeth, Victoria, Grace, James and George. • Queen Elizabeth II is among those keen for the new baby to greet the world. On a visit to northern England on Wednesday, she was asked by a little girl whether she wants her great-grandchild to be a boy or a girl. The queen replied: ""I don't think I mind. I would very much like it to arrive. I'm going on holiday."" • Prince Charles' wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, said Monday that the family was on tenterhooks for the baby's arrival -- and suggested it could be very soon. ""We're all waiting at the end of a telephone,"" she said, in an exchange filmed by ITV. ""I hope by the end of the week, he or she will be there."" • The baby will have the title His or Her Royal Highness Prince or Princess (the baby's name) of Cambridge, St. James's Palace said this month. However, it could be as long as 10 days before the baby's name is announced. • Anyone born in Britain on the same day as William and Catherine's baby will receive a special coin from the Royal Mint: a silver penny, dated 2013, that will come in a blue pouch for a boy or a pink one for a girl. • The first indication that the royal baby is on its way will be an announcement in the media that the duchess has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor, royal sources tell CNN. The next public announcement is expected to be that of the birth. It will be made in the form of a formal bulletin, signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to Buckingham Palace. There, the notice will be placed in a gilt frame positioned on an easel -- the same one used to announce William's birth -- and placed in the palace forecourt for all to see. • The first to know about the royal baby will be Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister David Cameron and the governors general of each of the commonwealth nations, along with the rest of the royal and Middleton families. If the baby arrives in the middle of the night, it's unlikely the queen will be awoken, so there is a chance in that instance that an official announcement will not be made until the following morning. • Celebratory gun salutes will be sounded by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park (41 rounds) and the Honorable Artillery Company at the Tower of London (62 rounds) after the baby is born. • William and Catherine did not want to know the sex of their baby beforehand, royal sources say. There has been speculation it is a girl, however, especially after a member of the public said in March that the duchess almost uttered ""daughter"" while at a public event in Grimsby. The woman said the duchess was given a teddy bear and replied, ""Thank you, I will take that for my d--"" but then stopped herself. • The baby will be third in line to the throne after Prince Charles and Prince William, regardless of gender. A rule change in 2011 ended centuries of male primogeniture, which decreed that the crown passed to the eldest son and was bestowed on a daughter only when there were no sons. It means that if the next royal baby is a girl, she will eventually become queen; previously, a younger male sibling would have taken precedence. • The queen's cousin, Margaret Rhodes, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour she hoped the child would have a normal childhood. ""I imagine and hope that its early life, until it's at least in its teens, will be just a jolly, happy, ordinary child's life,"" she said. • It's not known where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to spend the days and weeks following the birth. William is expected to be given the usual paternity leave of two weeks by the Ministry of Defence, royal sources say. He will then return to his job as a helicopter search and rescue pilot. • The revelation that Catherine was pregnant came after she was admitted to a London hospital in December for acute morning sickness.","William and Catherine lookalikes prompt a flutter of excitement outside hospital .

"(CNN) -- However crude the calculation, especially amid all the civilian casualties, the winners and losers in the Israel-Gaza conflict are already reshaping political alliances in the Middle East. Before the last rocket was fired, before U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the cease-fire, there was already a consensus building among stakeholders and analysts that the events of the last week have transformed the fortunes of many in the Middle East. Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, clearly underestimated, deftly navigated what is a minefield of competing interests, including those of his own country. ""For a civilian president in Egypt perceived as a weak leader, he has, much to everyone's surprise, delivered,"" says Aaron David Miller, a Middle East scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center. Egypt and Morsy proved 'pivotal' in Gaza cease-fire talks . Morsy proved he has the leverage necessary to bring Hamas to the table and get its leadership to agree to a cease-fire. Brokering that deal has given him much needed political capital in both the Arab world and the United States. This was a qualified victory as well for Israel and its tenacious Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Just months before an election, Netanyahu's government targeted and killed Hamas' military leader, Ahmed al-Jaabari. Hundreds of airstrikes on Gaza followed, but the real victory here might have been the combat debut of Iron Dome, the U.S.-funded defense shield that kept dozens of Hamas rockets from hitting Israeli civilians. Ironically, though, Hamas has emerged emboldened from this conflict and its truce. ""Hamas has emerged stronger, it has consolidated its control over Gaza and it has gained now more legitimacy,"" explains Miller. In the eyes of the Palestinian people, the militant leaders of Gaza took on Israel more boldly than ever before, firing rockets farther than ever before. And they may yet manage to get an easing of the Gaza economic blockade if a more comprehensive deal can be reached. Timeline: Israel-Gaza conflict . ""Look what they accomplished; they, rather than (President Mahmoud) Abbas, has put the Palestinian issue back on the international stage,"" says Miller. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah faction have lost much in this conflict. He was supposed to be the moderate peace broker who could finally forge a new deal with Israel. Now he cannot even claim to speak for all Palestinians and has shown that he has no leverage with Hamas, his archrival. And then there's Iran, on the outside looking in but always a player when it comes to Hamas. Iran's hand now arguably has been weakened after this episode. The Iron Dome shot hundreds of its missiles out the sky. While Israel has always accused Iran of smuggling weapons to Hamas through the Egyptian border, Iran today implicitly confirmed it. ""Gaza is under siege, so we cannot help them. The Fajr-5 missiles have not been shipped from Iran. Its technology has been transferred (there) and are being produced quickly,"" Mohamed Ali Jafari, the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, is quoted as saying by the Iranian news agency ISNA. The question now: If Israel attacks Iran, can Iran still call on Hamas to retaliate with missiles or have they been rendered ineffective with an ever-improving Iron Dome? In just a matter of days, with one truce, allies and enemies in the region have shifted, and this will certainly affect any future peace negotiations. How the Middle East has changed since the last Gaza conflict .","Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy shows value of his leverage with Hamas .

"(CNN) -- It's been days since three Latin American presidents offered to give Edward Snowden a safe place to hide out from U.S. authorities. But the man who's admitted leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs remains holed up at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport. And the global guessing game over his next steps hasn't stopped. It's still unclear where Snowden will go, and how he'll get there. What's the holdup? Out of Russia: Snowden's options . Sure, we've heard fiery speeches offering asylum from leftist leaders who are eager to criticize the United States. But supporting Snowden's cause and wanting to make Uncle Sam look bad aren't the only parts of the equation, with so many trade and diplomatic relations hanging in the balance, said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. ""They want to make a point,"" he said, ""but I think they're concerned about suffering the consequences, which I think would be serious. The United States has made that pretty clear."" Here's a look at the pros and cons that leaders are facing in five Latin American nations that are among the 27 countries where Snowden is seeking asylum. Venezuela . President Nicolas Maduro was the first leader to say he'd give Snowden asylum. Officials have said they're waiting to hear whether Snowden accepts the offer. Pros: . • Maduro regularly alleges U.S. imperialism, has accused the U.S. government of trying to destabilize his country and even suggested that U.S. officials may have infected late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez with the cancer that eventually killed him. Taking in a high-profile fugitive wanted in the United States would give him another platform to criticize the country. • It's been months since the death of Chavez, who earned major political points at home and a place in the global spotlight with his fierce criticisms of America, including a notorious United Nations General Assembly speech where he called President George W. Bush the devil. Maduro describes himself as Chavez's son. But while he might have the same speechwriters as his predecessor, he doesn't have the same charisma, and it seems like fewer people are listening to his words. Giving Snowden asylum would be politically popular in Venezuela, shoring up support for Maduro among Chavez loyalists. • It also has regional and global implications. ""This for Maduro, I think, really provides an opportunity for him to show himself on the world stage as a regional leader, as the true successor of Chavez,"" said David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. Cons: . • Relations with the United States have been slowly thawing since Maduro's election in April. Last month, things were looking up when U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua. That would change if Venezuela granted asylum to Snowden. ""This will clearly freeze the warming of relations with Venezuela,"" Smilde said. • Despite years of tense Venezuela-U.S. relations, economic ties between the two countries remain strong. Imports and exports between the United States and Venezuela totaled more than $56 billion last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Venezuela's state-run oil company makes tens of billions of dollars annually from exports to the United States. Venezuela is the United States' fourth-largest supplier of imported crude oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Would offering Snowden asylum put that relationship in jeopardy? It might. But this isn't the first time Venezuela has run afoul of the United States. Smilde argues that in offering Snowden asylum, Maduro gains more than he loses. ""Surely there's going to be legislators in the Senate who are going to want sanctions against Venezuela, but I don't think it's going to get very far,"" Smilde said. Shifter says it's unclear whether the benefits are worth the costs. Bolivia . President Evo Morales says he's furious about what happened last week with his presidential jet, which had to land in Austria after European countries allegedly closed their airspace amid suspicions that Snowden was aboard. Now Morales says he's willing to give Snowden asylum as a ""fair protest"" of the incident. Pros: . • Morales has long slammed what he calls U.S. imperialism, kicking out the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. ambassador, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Accepting Snowden would fall in line with the Bolivian president's argument that his country would be better off without any U.S. interference. And in terms of its relationship with the United States, Bolivia has little goodwill left to lose. • The United States' trade ties with Bolivia are weaker than its links with other countries in the region. ""Bolivia's a country that I think has the least real economic interest with the United States,"" Shifter said. Cons: . • Still, there's some economic connection. Exports and imports between the United States and Bolivia totaled more than $2.4 billion last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. • Despite Morales' fierce criticism of European countries and the United States after the plane incident, Shifter said, it's unclear whether he really wants Snowden to come to Bolivia. Nicaragua . President Daniel Ortega says his country will grant asylum to Snowden ""if circumstances permit."" Was that a way to sound supportive, but give himself a way out? It's unclear. Pros: . • Like Maduro and Morales, Ortega is a vocal critic of the United States, and his allegations of U.S. imperialism play well with his supporters. Cons: . • Business is big for Ortega's government, and it's about to get a lot bigger. Chinese investors and Nicaraguan leaders have just signed a deal to build a $40 billion canal through the country. Does that mean Nicaragua is now looking East but not West when it comes to business? Quite the opposite, Shifter said. ""I think the canal project is another factor that makes them even more interested in staying on the good side of the United States,"" he said. • That's not all. Exports and imports between the United States and Nicaragua totaled more than $3.8 billion last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And Nicaragua gets trade preferences from the United States. As concerns about Snowden from business leaders mount, they won't fall on deaf ears with Ortega, Shifter said. ""Ortega has good relations with the business community in Nicaragua. He's somebody that I think also has a pragmatic streak in him,"" Shifter said. ""Rhetorically, at times, he's confrontational, but behind the scenes, he's making deals."" Ecuador . Snowden set his sights on Ecuador with his first asylum request after leaving Hong Kong on June 23. President Rafael Correa railed against the United States in fiery speeches over the issue earlier this month. But the government has said it's still weighing the request, but can't act until Snowden's in Ecuadorian territory. Some speculate that the delay in getting a clear response from Ecuador is what inspired Snowden to apply for asylum in dozens more countries. Pros: . • Ecuador granted asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange last year, and has touted the decision as a clear sign that the South American nation is a defender of human rights. Giving Snowden asylum would give officials another platform to make that case. • Defiant authorities in Ecuador said last month that they wouldn't bow to U.S. pressure in Snowden's case, vowing to reject trade benefits so U.S. officials couldn't manipulate them. Cons: . • When Ecuadorian officials said they didn't need U.S. trade preferences, business leaders issued a swift response: Not so fast. And with about half of Ecuador's exports heading to the United States and trade between the two nations totaling more than $16 billion last year, Correa probably will weigh their comments carefully, Shifter said. ""Correa is a guy who on the one hand, he's very defiant of the United States and wants to be the rhetorical leader of the left in Latin America,"" Shifter said. ""On the other hand, he's got a very broad coalition in Ecuador and is trying to be more pragmatic and attract foreign investment."" • After speaking with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden last month, Correa adopted a more measured tone. ""We have to act very carefully but with courage,"" he said, ""without contradicting our principles but with a lot of care, responsibility and respect, of course, towards the U.S. but also respect for the truth."" Cuba . President Raul Castro hasn't shied away from talking about the Snowden case. He's hailed the former National Security Agency contractor's revelations and stressed that he supports fellow Latin American countries' right to grant Snowden asylum. But there are two key things he hasn't said: whether Cuba will grant asylum to Snowden and whether he'd allow a plane carrying the U.S. intelligence leaker to make a stopover in Cuba on the way to South America. Pros: . • Decades of hostile relations between the United States and Cuba and a tough economic embargo could mean that Cuba would have less to lose than other Latin American nations when it comes to granting asylum. With so many sanctions in place, said Philip Peters, president of the Cuba Research Center in Washington, ""I don't know what more the United States could add."" • Official media in Cuba have painted Snowden as a hero. Cuba could decide to step in, Shifter said, ""if there's an issue where it would have to do with Latin American pride and dignity and sovereignty."" • While granting Snowden asylum might be a step too far, letting a connecting flight carrying him land in Cuba might be an option. ""I think there's a measure of risk in that for Cuba, but it may be OK if he doesn't stay there, if they're facilitating it as a transit stop,"" Shifter said. ""But I think it would make them uneasy."" Cons: . • There are signs that Washington's relationship with Havana is improving, such as a recent agreement to hold talks over bringing back direct mail between the two nations. And Cuba is hopeful about more developments in U.S. President Barack Obama's second term. ""I think that maybe Cuba does not want to complicate this process and risk the advances that have been made recently,"" Peters told CNN en Español. ""I would guess that Cuba does not have an interest in receiving this man, and does not want to complicate the relationship with Washington. Even though it isn't a very good relationship, it is a relationship that has gotten a little better in recent months."" CNN's Mariano Castillo, Patrick Oppmann and Patricia Janiot and journalist Samantha Lugo contributed to this report.","Venezuelan and Bolivian leaders have offered Edward Snowden asylum .

"New York (CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced Thursday he has reimbursed the state of New Jersey for the cost of using a state police helicopter to travel with his wife to his son's high school baseball game. The Republican has come under fire from opposition lawmakers and the public since he touched down Tuesday near the ball field in Montvale, about 80 miles from Trenton, the capital. After initially refusing to reimburse the state, Christie has repaid $2,151 to cover the cost of his flights to the game, Christie said in a news conference. ""What I know about this business is, perception matters,"" Christie said. ""I'm not going to allow the media and the hacks of the Democratic power to ... get away from the matter because they want to have a circus."" Christie claimed he was using the helicopter to balance his responsibilities as a father with his busy schedule as governor. ""I'm governor 24/7, every single day, but I'm also a father,"" he said. Christie, who has taken 33 helicopter flights since assuming office last January, said he has been far more ""judicious"" in his helicopter use than other recent governors, citing Govs. Jim McGreevey, Thomas Kean and James Florio. ""If you look at the way I use this helicopter, it's not like I'm using it as a perk of office,"" he said. The Republican budget hawk added that according to the State Police, the travel does not cost taxpayers money, because as the pilots need the flying time in order to be certified. When asked, the governor reiterated that he will not be running for president in the coming election but has refused to ""rule out"" 2016. The GOP paid for a portion of the helicopter rides, $919, to cover the cost of Christie's flight from the ballgame to Princeton, where he met with GOP contributors visiting from Iowa, according to Andy Pratt of the New Jersey Treasury. Still, some Democrats were not swayed. ""To use these vehicles to shuttle between both a personal and a political activity is an outright abuse of taxpayer dollars,"" said Democrat Assemblywoman Joan Quigley. The former federal prosecutor, who earned a reputation for battling corruption, was elected on a platform of fiscal discipline and eliminating government waste and abuse. During his first year in office, Christie helped to pass a $29 billion budget, narrowing an $11 billion deficit with cuts in public-sector spending, including employee pensions and benefits. The governor has since called for some $200 million in tax cuts. He has focused on spending reductions on public unions -- particularly the state's powerful teachers' unions -- who often have said the governor has used them as an excuse for the state's broader financial troubles.","Gov.

"(CNN) -- Celebrity chef Paula Deen's sons staunchly defended their mother Tuesday, saying allegations of racism are false ""character assassination."" ""Neither one of our parents ever taught us to be bigoted toward any other person for any reason,"" Bobby Deen told CNN's ""New Day"" in an exclusive interview with Chris Cuomo. ""Our mother is one of the most compassionate, good-hearted, empathetic people that you'd ever meet,"" he added. ""These accusations are very hurtful to her, and it's very sad."" In a recent lawsuit deposition, Deen admitted having used the ""N-word"" long ago. The suit alleges discrimination and racism at two of Deen's restaurants. But the Deen sons -- also chefs with TV shows, and part of their family's restaurant businesses -- insisted the depictions of their mother are an effort by the plaintiff to get a chunk of the family fortune. ""I'm disgusted by the entire thing, because it began as extortion and it has become character assassination,"" Bobby Deen said. Official: Food Network will not renew Paula Deen's contract . Jamie Deen said it's ""ridiculous, completely absurd to think there is an environment of racism in our business, and it's really disrespectful to the people that we work with. We have strong, educated men and women of character that have been with us for five, 10, 15, 20 years. To think they would allow themselves to be in this position is simply baloney. It's ridiculous."" When he was a child, Jamie Deen said, his parents taught him the story of his hero, baseball legend Hank Aaron. They explained that ""the challenges (Aaron) had to overcome because of his color was unacceptable."" Paula Deen's fortune has taken a hit in recent days as the Food Network dropped her, as did Smithfield Foods, one of her key sponsors. There are questions now over whether other businesses including QVC and Walmart may cut ties with the star of Southern cooking. Paula Deen: From the frying pan to the firestorm . The lawsuit . Deen and her brother are being sued for alleged sexual and racial harassment by a former manager of Deen's restaurants in Savannah, Georgia. Lisa T. Jackson's lawsuit alleges that Deen and Bubba Hier committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five-year tenure at Deen's Lady & Sons and Uncle Bubba's Oyster House eateries in Savannah. When Dean was questioned under oath for a deposition, she was asked whether she had used the ""N-word."" Deen answered that she had probably used the racial slur when talking to her husband about ""when a black man burst into the bank that I was working at and put a gun to my head."" iReport: Defending Paula Deen . Asked whether she had used the word since, she responded, ""I'm sure I have, but it's been a very long time.""

"(CNN) -- Hamas wants an end to Israel's long blockade of Gaza and raids on the territory in any cease-fire that might put a stop to five days of weaponry plummeting from the sky, a top Palestinian official said Sunday. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, said an Israeli airstrike killed a family of 10 on Sunday. Israel, meanwhile, said Hamas had fired nearly 150 rockets into Israel in a single day, and that the strike was aimed at killing one of the leaders of the militant group's rocket corps -- but Israel was unsure whether he was among the dead. It was the latest violence in what has become a daily nightmare for millions in the region, one that puts Gaza's 1.7 million residents and millions of Israelis in harm's way. But an Israeli special envoy was in Egypt for cease-fire talks late Sunday, the Egyptian government said, and a stream of Arab League, U.N. and European diplomats were darting in and out of the region on similar errands. Nabil Sha'ath, a senior Palestinian negotiator, said Hamas is demanding an end to ""the harassment and draconian siege of Gaza that prevents anything from coming in or going out, so that there will be a normal life for the people of Gaza."" The territory has been under a crippling economic embargo since Hamas won control of the territory from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank. U.S. fears escalation to ground invasion . But Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Sunday that he is in ""continuing contact"" with exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal and called for Palestinian unity during the Israeli offensive. Sha'ath, also a Fatah leader, said Hamas wants Israel to stop targeting the leadership of Palestinian factions and to expand the waters Palestinian fishermen are allowed to trawl from three miles offshore to 30. Sha'ath said the Palestinian goal was to reach not only an end to the latest fighting but a long-term cease-fire between Hamas and Israel. ""The attempt is to reach a real stable situation. That's why they are asking for commitment on Israeli typical aggression and periodic incursions and constant shooting and firing at the fishermen in the sea,"" he said. But rockets continued to fall on Israel on Sunday, and airstrikes continued in Gaza. Fresh sirens sounded Sunday in Tel Aviv, but the Israel Defense Forces reported that it had intercepted at least two rockets headed for the city with its ""Iron Dome"" missile-defense system. A rocket struck a car in the Israeli town of Ofakim, while another hit a woman's carport while she was inside her house in Ashkelon. Iron Dome is a game-changer, Israelis say . And in Gaza, Hamas-run al Aqsa television showed images of children's bodies being carried away from a house blown apart by an Israeli airstrike. They were among a family of 10 who died there, according to a Palestinian ambulance service. On Twitter, the al Qassam Brigades -- Hamas' military wing -- called it a ""massacre committed by Israeli occupation."" But Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, the IDF's chief spokeswoman, told CNN that Yehya Bayaa -- a ""senior Hamas member"" -- was targeted in the strike. The IDF identified Bayaa as one of the leaders of the Hamas rocket-launching unit. ""When I say a senior Hamas member, I mean members that have Israeli blood on their hands -- members of Hamas that planned either the abduction of soldiers or are very much involved in targeting Israelis,"" she told CNN. Q & A: What is Hamas? Leibovitch said the house was Bayaa's home and suspected command center and that the Israeli military was examining video of the strike to look for signs of secondary explosions -- an indication that there were explosives inside. But late Sunday, she said she did not know for sure whether Bayaa had been killed. Israel also said Sunday that it was not to blame for the death of a Palestinian child last week -- a 4-year-old boy whose lifeless body was kissed by Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil during his visit to a Gaza hospital Friday. CNN visited the child's home, which neighbors said had been bombed five hours previously. Neighbors and family members told CNN they heard an aircraft before the explosion. But the Israeli military told CNN on Sunday it did not carry out any airstrikes at the time of the child's death. The IDF said had stopped its attacks for Kandil's visit, raising questions about what caused the fatal blast. One possibility could be the misfire of a Hamas rocket intended for Israel, since CNN's crew in Gaza said it saw two such rockets passing overhead -- apparently fired not far from where the boy lived. GPS: What does this all mean? Israel launched its offensive on Wednesday in response to persistent rocket attacks from militants in Gaza. Early Monday, the Gaza health ministry said 76 people have been killed in Gaza during the ongoing hostilities. It was not clear how many of the dead were combatants. Earlier, the territory's interior ministry said 20 children and eight women were among the dead. More than 660 people were injured, the interior ministry said. The IDF said one Israeli was wounded Sunday. Three Israelis had been killed and 69 wounded over the course of the conflict. Militants in Gaza had fired nearly 1,000 rockets at Israel, the IDF reported. More than 340 had been intercepted, including 41 of the 146 fired Sunday, the military said. Meanwhile, the IDF conducted 130 strikes during the day, it reported. The IDF, which has been touting the ""pinpoint"" precision of its airstrikes via Twitter, said it had hit a slew of what it called ""terrorist"" sites while sparing other damage. ""Terrorists put an underground launch site next to a mosque. We targeted the site. The mosque was unharmed,"" the IDF said in one post, which was accompanied by military video of the raid. The Israeli military has also said that nearly 100 rockets fired from Gaza in recent days have crashed back into the strip. ""Hamas fires from civilian areas and hits its own people,"" it said on Twitter. The Israeli government has called up 75,000 reservists and massed 30,000 troops across the border of the Palestinian territory, the IDF said. In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters that Israel is prepared to significantly escalate its operation against Palestinian militants in Gaza. ""We are exacting a heavy price from Hamas and the (other) terrorist organizations, and IDF is prepared for a significant expansion of its operations,"" Netanyahu said before his weekly Cabinet meeting. The fighting has put new strains on Israel's relationship with Egypt, which is attempting to broker a cease-fire. The Muslim Brotherhood-led government that took power in June has pledged to maintain Egypt's peace treaty with Israel -- the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the turbulent region -- but sympathy for the Palestinians runs deep among Egyptians. On Egypt's border with Gaza, about 500 Egyptian protesters crossed into the territory on Sunday in what their leader said was a show of solidarity with the Palestinians. They raised Palestinian flags and chanted, ""We are the youth of January 25 revolution, Palestine will be free! Open the crossing, Israel is the enemy!"" ""We have broken the siege,"" said Rami Shaath, the group's main organizer. ""The Arab Spring has changed the region. We are happy to go in to support our Palestinian brothers, but it's sad to hear the explosions of the Israeli bombing of Gaza all the way on the Egyptian side. We brought in small amounts medical supplies, food, and water, but our main message is political support to the Gazans."" Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby and 16 foreign ministers from the league's member states will drive into Gaza on Tuesday for talks, a spokesman for the organization said. Meanwhile, Abbas will hold talks in the West Bank with Tony Blair, the envoy for the Mideast Quartet, and with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon during their visits to the region in the coming days, said Saeb Erakat, a member of the PLO's executive committee and an Abbas ally. The United States and several European countries have put the brunt of the blame for the current crisis on Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist movement that has been branded a terrorist organization by the United States, Israel and the European Union. Those Western powers say Israel has a right to self-defense, while Arab and Muslim nations have accused Israel of being the aggressor. Rocket attacks into Israel were the ""precipitating event"" for the fighting under way now, U.S. President Barack Obama said during a stop in Thailand on Sunday. ""We are actively working with all the parties in the region to see if we can end those missiles being fired without further escalation of violence in the region."" Obama said he has spoken with Netanyahu, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, and Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan. He emphasized that ""those who champion the cause of the Palestinians should recognize that if we see a further escalation of the situation in Gaza, then the likelihood"" of peace talks resuming that could lead to a two-state solution ""is going to be pushed off way into the future,"" Obama said. CNN's Sara Sidner reported from Gaza City; CNN's Fred Pleitgen reported from southern Israel; and CNN's Josh Levs from Atlanta. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Kindah Shair, Amir Ahmed, Jessica Yellin, Ben Wedeman and Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: The death toll in Gaza climbs to 76, says the Gaza health ministry .

"(CNN) -- What do Steve Jobs, Hollywood film studios and Silicon Valley venture capitalists have in common? All have, at one stage or another, sought out Ren Ng -- the Malaysian-born inventor of Lytro, a hand-held digital camera that aims to revolutionize photography and simplify the art of taking pictures. Lytro works by employing a micro-lens array to capture the entire light field -- every ray of light traveling in all directions through a scene, which regular cameras cannot do -- before focusing the information captured onto a sensor. Collecting all light data enables users to alter a picture's focus and perspective long after the image has been taken. The technology caught the eye of the late Steve Jobs, who invited Ng to his Palo Alto home to demo the device, and attracted a cool $50 million start-up cash from eager venture capitalists. See also: A light bulb moment for the wireless web . The camera launched in the U.S. last February before Lytro announced it was expanding into Asia and Australia in October. Ng took time out to speak to CNN about his invention and how he transformed Lytro from a Stanford University PhD project into a potentially lucrative commercial reality. CNN: What makes Lytro such a revolutionary invention? Ren Ng: It lets you focus pictures after you take the shot and this really enriches your creativity as it makes a totally new kind of interactive picture. It also lets you share that creativity online with your friends and family ... (and) can be embedded fully into social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+. CNN: What was the inspiration for the Lytro camera? RN: I am a very keen photographer. I have enjoyed taking pictures since I was a kid with my family, but I became more serious about it at university. From the academic side, I was studying pictures from a computer graphic stance and the theory of the light field. On the personal side, I was rock climbing and taking pictures with my friends. We took all sorts of portrait and action pictures and I was thinking at the time that these are inherently difficult to focus correctly. That made me ask questions about the computer graphics of the light field that I was studying academically, and if those could be applied in commercial photography. CNN: How long has the process of invention to market taken you? RN: I started the company in 2006 and I had been working on research for about three years before that. Personally, I've been working on it for about nine years. We've gone through about three rounds of venture capital with some of the best venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. In total we've raised approximately $50 million in investment. See also: How the Rubik's Cube took over the world . CNN: You made a prototype when researching your dissertation, did you realize you were sitting on a multi-million dollar invention? RN: The idea to try and commercialize came very late and it is something that is not very natural to me being an academic. There were two eureka moments during the PhD, if you will. The first was taking these equations (about the optical architecture of the light field) and starting to simulate them on a computer. The second was very similar except it was more physical. We built a prototype camera where you could take a picture using the software developed during the simulation stage. CNN: Does Lytro make skilled photography redundant? RN: I think it's a very compelling idea that you'll never take a bad picture anymore, but that's not what this camera is about. It's not a magical device ... but it does let you take pictures very rapidly and without having to worry about things like focus, like you do with a regular camera. Basically, with a regular camera you have to take time or allow the camera to focus before you take the shot. Because we can allow you to focus after you've taken the picture by capturing the full light field, we can trigger the shutter instantly without delay. And people find that very helpful. CNN: What was it like being invited to meet Steve Jobs? RN: It really was an incredible experience. Not too many people have the chance to do that. Like many people out there I'm inspired by the level of attention to detail, design and execution of Apple products. Getting to meet him was exciting as he's a very inspiring person. We discussed a range of topics and it was terrific to [meet] like that in a one-on-one setting. See also: Teach young people to be innovative . CNN: Has it been easy combining the business and science side of things? RN: It was the hardest thing I've ever done, for sure. Entrepreneurship is a very full body immersion into a very diverse skill set. Being able to execute technically through to a vision of a product that can be compelled to people and then being able to communicate that. I had to develop a lot of these very different aspects, but more importantly I have also met a lot of people who have joined Lytro, invested in Lytro or become partners with Lytro that have helped us to grow this vision of bringing computational photography to consumer cameras. CNN: From your experiences with Lytro, is commercial savvy something that modern inventors require just as much as a scientific or creative mind? RN: I think so, absolutely. More importantly, the company that intends to commercialize an idea will need to have all of those skill sets (technical, business and commercial) represented. I still definitely haven't mastered all of those skills. We have over 100 people working on this to bring it up to market and bring it forward now. But I do think that technical inventors will have to prove their vision of how those technologies will move into products that make sense for markets and for customers. CNN: And finally, what would your advice be to would-be inventors wrestling with tomorrow's big ideas? RN: Think big and have perseverance.","Ren Ng is the Malaysian-born inventor of the Lytro camera .

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for two jailed members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot have asked for the women to be allowed to do community service instead of serving the remainder of their prison sentence, state media said Friday. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina were sentenced to two years in prison for hooliganism after a trial in August 2012. The community service could include working for a charity or the media, official news agency Itar-Tass cited attorney Irina Khrunova as saying. The two women, who have been in prison since March 2012, are due for release in March, state-run RIA Novosti news agency said. Both have had requests for bail denied in recent months, the news agency said. The two women were tried last year along with a third member of the band for performing a song critical of then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in an Orthodox cathedral. Video footage of their ""punk prayer"" was posted online. Yekaterina Samutsevich, the third member of the band, was sentenced at the same time as the others but was freed from prison in October after her defense presented new evidence.

"New York (CNN) -- A federal appeals court in New York became the nation's second to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, finding that the Clinton-era law's denial of federal benefits to married same-sex couples is unconstitutional. The divisive act, which was passed in 1996, bars federal recognition of such marriages and says other states cannot be forced to recognize them. Read the ruling (PDF) The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals determined Thursday that the federal law violates the Constitution's equal protection clause, ruling in favor of widow Edith Windsor, an 83-year-old lesbian who sued the federal government for charging her more than $363,000 in estate taxes after being denied the benefit of spousal deductions. The court upheld a lower court's decision in a 2-1 majority ruling and determined that America's gay population ""has suffered a history of discrimination"" similar to that faced by women in years past. ""What I'm feeling is elated,"" said Windsor. ""Did I ever think it could come to be, altogether? ... Not a chance in hell."" Victory for Windsor, years after her longtime partner's death . The case centered on the money Windsor wanted back, but it raised the more looming question of whether the federal government can continue to ignore a state's recognition of her marriage and financially penalize her as a result. Timeline: Same-sex marriage . ""Homosexuals are not in a position to adequately protect themselves from the discriminatory wishes of the majoritarian public,"" wrote Dennis Jacobs, a conservative judge in New York. A federal appeals court in Boston made a similar ruling in May, but the moves are considered largely symbolic as the issue is expected to eventually be taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court. Man tells senators: Defense of Marriage Act cost me my home . ""This court has a limited jurisdiction,"" CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said. ""But this is a very favorable decision for those who believe that the Defense of Marriage (Act) unconstitutionally discriminates against same-sex couples."" Those who back striking down the law ""believe this decision will give them a very strong position arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court in the future,"" he said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also weighed in on the three-judge-panel's decision, saying it ""provides further momentum for national progress on this important civil rights issue."" Boston appeals court rules Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional . In February, the Obama administration ordered the Justice Department to stop defending the constitutionality of the law, though a GOP-backed group has since taken up the issue in courts across the country. Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Maryland, Washington, Maine and Minnesota are voting on the issue in November referendums. Five states -- Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey and Rhode Island -- allow civil unions that provide rights similar to marriage. Thursday's ruling was celebrated by many top Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, gay and civil rights advocacy groups such as GLAAD and the ACLU, and former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee. Others criticized the ruling, including National Organization for Marriage President Brian Brown. He said 32 states have, by popular vote, backed a traditional definition of marriage being between a man and a woman and expressed hope the Supreme Court will decide the matter. ""This is yet another example of judicial activism and elite judges imposing their views on the American people, and further demonstrates why it is imperative for the U.S. Supreme Court to (act),"" Brown said. For her part, Windsor said she wants Thursday's decision to be ""part of the beginning of the end"" so that married homosexual couples someday will be viewed the same as heterosexual ones in the government's eyes. And she wants the entire issue of a person's sexual orientation to soon become a nonissue when it comes to marriage in American society. ""My sincere hope is that (it will be irrelevant) in my lifetime,"" Windsor said. Bloomberg taps fortune to back Maryland's gay marriage vote . Polls: Majority favor same-sex marriage in Maryland .

"(CNN) -- Following this week's revelation that J.K. Rowling penned a crime thriller under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, the ""Harry Potter"" creator has joined a long line of women who have written novels under a cloak of masculinity. While some authors choose to write under a pen name as a form of artistic expression, many female authors purposefully opt for a male pseudonym to appeal to a wider audience, says Carmela Ciuraru, author of ""Nom de plume: A (secret) history of pseudonyms"". ""Sadly in certain genres, it still helps to be a man -- particularly in crime or science fiction,"" Ciuraru told CNN. ""Sometimes it's easier to be taken seriously as a man, and J.K. Rowling is in a difficult position as her reputation means that her work can't be judged on merit alone,"" she adds. With Rowling's book ""The Cuckoo's Calling"" climbing the charts on Amazon bestselling list, CNN takes a look at renowned female writers, past and present, who have adopted male pen names. Louisa May Alcott (A.M. Barnard) Best known for her seminal tale ""Little Women"", Louisa May Alcott, spent much of her early career writing under the nom de plume A. M. Barnard. Featuring feisty women who did not conform to the ideal of the 19th century female, her early novels ""A Long Fatal Love Chase"" and ""Pauline's Passion and Punishment"" were hidden beneath an ambiguous pseudonym, giving Alcott the artistic license to explore different conceptions of the fairer sex without fear of disapproval. This darker literary alter ego confronted racier themes, and was discovered more than 50 years after Alcott's death by book dealer Leona Rostenberg in 1942. Letters between the author and a Boston publisher in 1855 and 1856 read, ""We would like more stories from you ... and if you prefer you may use the pseudonym of A.M. Barnard or any other man's name if you will."" Nora Roberts (J.D. Robb) After a highly successful career as a novelist under her own name, Nora Roberts decided to adopt a more elusive tag for her ""...in Death"" collection: a canon comprising of 43 published works, with three more set for release later this year. Unlike J. K. Rowling's quick reveal -- a mere three months after joining the literary world as Robert Galbraith -- Roberts kept her pen name under wraps until the 12th installment of her romantic thriller series. Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) Famed for her novels exploring psychological realism, Mary Ann Evans -- better known to the literary world as George Eliot -- was not short of opinions on fellow female writers. Publishing an essay in 1856 entitled ""Silly Novels by Lady Novelists,"" Evans lambasted the glut of unremarkable work produced by women in the era, which she believed diminished the credibility of female writers as a whole. It was this that spurred the ""Middlemarch"" writer on to use a male pseudonym, musing: ""By a peculiar thermometric adjustment, when a woman's talent is at zero, journalistic approbation is at the boiling pitch; when it attains mediocrity it is already no more than summer heat; and if she ever reaches excellence, critical enthusiasm drops to the freezing point."" Christina Lynch and Meg Howrey (Magnus Flyte) ""City of Dark Magic"" came across as a rather intriguing debut novel from novice author Magnus Flyte when it was published in 2012. But it was soon revealed that the brains behind the book were Meg Howrey, an actress and author, and Christina Lynch, a journalist and TV producer. Citing themselves as Magnus's 'wranglers,' the duo maintains his existence as an mysterious enigma, even 'interviewing' him for their blog. Explaining their decision to adopt a single fictitious name for themselves, Howrey said: ""We had both read a raft of articles talking about how men don't buy books written by women."" They may have been proven correct, as their first novel has spawned a successful sequel with the male nom de plume still intact. The Bronte sisters (Acton, Currer and Ellis Bell) Perhaps the most successful literary dynasty of all time, Charlotte, Anne and Emily Bronte collectively produced some of the world's best loved novels during the 19th century. Publishing works under male names beginning with the same first letter as their own, Currer, Acton and Ellis Bell produced their first offering -- a collection of poems -- in 1846, before going on to publish individual novels shortly after. ""Charlotte really believed in their talents, and was actually very controlling about the publication of their work,"" says Ciuraru. ""She was incredibly bold for an unmarried woman, but she was determined that they would publish as men in order to get reviews that wouldn't be condescending.""","J.K.

"(CNN) -- When Annie Leibovitz photographed the heavily pregnant actress Demi Moore for her private album, she never intended for that image to be seen by a wider audience. But the young editor Tina Brown decided to put the picture on the cover of her magazine Vanity Fair. That was 1991. More than two decades later, that very Vanity Fair cover is one of the most memorable images of our time. ""I didn't expect the storm that it created,"" Brown, now editor-in-chief of The Daily Beast and Newsweek Global, told CNN. ""It was a good risk because we put on an unbelievable amount of sales. It became a kind of iconic picture for women."" The cover was one of a series of bold and sometimes controversial decisions that have cemented Brown as one of the most influential magazine editors of a generation. The risks Brown has taken -- from adding celebrity culture to highbrow news magazines to ending the print run of Newsweek magazine -- have brought both success and failure throughout her career. ""Unfortunately taking risks comes so easily to me that you can call it reckless at times,"" said Brown. ""I have to hold myself back a little and think 'wait a minute, be careful because you know you can blow it, too.'"" British-born Brown revived the fortunes of two ailing bastions of the newsstand, Vanity Fair, which she began editing aged just 30, and The New Yorker. In the 15 years Brown edited Vanity Fair, she took its monthly sales from 200,000 to 1.2 million and is credited with saving the magazine with her signature formula of mixing serious news with celebrity culture. She again worked her magic at The New Yorker, which she edited for six years, increasing circulation by 145% on the newsstand and 28% overall. In 1998, she left The New Yorker to launch Talk Magazine, which folded after only three years. Her latest venture is perhaps the most controversial of all. Brown launched news website The Daily Beast -- named after the fictional newspaper in the Evelyn Waugh novel ""Scoop"" -- in 2008 and merged it with Newsweek in 2010. While The Daily Beast is gaining a loyal digital readership -- with up to 16 million unique users a month and advertising up 30% year on year -- Brown's Midas touch has yet to work on Newsweek. Like many weekly print magazines, circulation for Newsweek has slumped -- from three million in 2007 to 1.5 million in 2012. And after 80 years on the newsstand, Brown took the stark decision to make Newsweek an all digital publication, printing its farewell edition on December 31, 2012. Twitter lit up with #LastPrintIssue, which also featured on the last cover of the magazine's final edition. Although it continues as an online magazine, its owner IAC has now announced it is seeking a buyer for the Newsweek brand. At the age of 59, Brown is now running an all digital business for the first time in her career, and divides opinion on whether she can adapt her operation to meet the demands of a fickle online media world. ""Great editors have great successes and great failures,"" says Ken Doctor, digital media analyst and author of Newsonomics, ""[Brown] had remarkable success with Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, but Talk was a spectacular failure. ""She is a 'tweener,' connecting Britain and U.S. sensibilities, connecting celebrity and serious news, connecting print and digital. There are not many people who have done that. ""She has ridden with the times in creating The Daily Beast; she is someone who adapts and learns."" Others, however, see Brown as a great magazine editor of her time, and believe she has yet to master the digital media landscape. ""She is a creature of a different age,"" says Jeff Bercovici, media and technology staff writer at Forbes. ""The formula she brought with her is the opposite of what works online. In the digital world, successful sites have started really small and gradually built up with unknown writers. Her line was to hire expensive writers and do something with panache, but that doesn't work online."" Though she has her critics, Brown marks her own success by the fact that people are still talking about her. ""I don't think any editor wants to put out anything that falls into silence,"" says Brown. ""I do tend to have points of view that are sometimes counter to the wind.""","Bold moves have made Tina Brown one of the most influential magazine editors of a generation .
She ended print-run of Newsweek, making it an all digital magazine alongside news website The Daily Beast .
Can she continue her magazine success in a digital media world?"
"(CNN) -- British journalism is under siege. With no settlement yet on press regulation following last year's judicial inquiry into phone hacking, this week has seen another seminal moment. Once again The Guardian, now clearly one of the crusading newspapers of the world, is at the heart of matters. The detention of the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald by security officials at Heathrow airport in London has unleashed a virulent debate about the place of the free press and the role of the state. The fact that obscure terrorism legislation was cited to hold him for nine hours and confiscate his computer equipment has added a further twist. In the past, police would be required to obtain court orders that could be contested before they could seize journalistic materials. Now the ill-defined threat of terror seems to excuse the tactics of a despotic state. A former editor of The Times in London, Simon Jenkins, wrote that ""harassing the family of those who have upset authority is the most obscene form of state terrorism,"" adding that ""the hysteria of the 'war on terror' is now corrupting every area of democratic government."" On the other hand, the UK's Home Office said Greenwald's partner David Miranda was carrying ""highly sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism,"" and those who oppose his detention should think about what they are condoning. Former Conservative member of Parliament Louise Mensch told the BBC that Miranda's actions were endangering the lives of U.S. and British agents. But Miranda was released without charge, with no suggestion he was seeking to help terrorists, and he is taking legal action against the UK authorities for the return of his property. This has polarized positions into a black and white, good or bad debate. If you support a free press publishing leaked state secrets you are apparently condoning terrorism. If you don't object to his detention loudly, you are condoning the secret state. Unlike the U.S., Britain has no First Amendment to protect the role of the free press. Like so much of the British constitution, it is an unwritten assumption. Reason lies in the complicated middle ground -- unfashionable as that may be. Social media, advocacy journalism, the need to define and claim the narrative and to be heard leaves little room for middle ground, but it is there that this conflict will be resolved. In that gray area, the ethical bridge between these positions will have to be rebuilt. As a start, we should acknowledge some plain truths. First, journalists have responsibilities toward the state, and governments have responsibilities toward a free and open press. Radical transparency, which would release anything and everything, is not what any responsible news organization, including the Guardian, would support. Equally, government agencies, however shadowy, need to recognize that journalism is a legitimate -- indeed essential -- activity in a democratic society, especially when it is inconvenient, embarrassing or blows secrets you would have preferred to remain hidden. Second, if you reveal a country's national secrets you shouldn't be surprised if its security services take an aggressive interest in you. This doesn't mean you were wrong to report them. Family members and loved ones should not have to carry public responsibility for your professional actions. But when they act as couriers for your work, they are more than family members and loved ones -- they are your proxy and will attract as much interest from the authorities. Third, journalism is not terrorism, so terrorism laws should not be used to intimidate journalists. There is no suggestion that David Miranda was planning to hand material to terrorists -- as the authorities well know. Governments embarrassed by the latest rounds of whistleblowing would like to cast a chill across investigative journalism. But it is not in the interests of a free society to allow that to happen. At heart, the issue is the legitimate scope and role of intelligence and security operations in a modern liberal democracy. As a first stab, they should be as small as necessary -- recognizing that serious threats to Western states mean their activities are bound to be, and need to be, of significant scale. What matters is how their powers are used and their accountability. It's what a country's moral authority rests upon. U.S. and UK authorities acting against legitimate newsgathering need to reflect on what it says about their democratic values. Seizing Associated Press phone records or intimidating the families of journalists will have some in Moscow, Tehran, Beijing and Pyongyang rubbing their hands with glee. Many believe the UK's security operations' insufficient scrutiny and accountability make them untrustworthy. Even David Anderson, Britain's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, is calling for a wide public and parliamentary debate on this law. At least that debate seems certain to happen. And it is better that the discussion about the state and journalism centers on a piece of public interest, serious journalism than over the criminal antics of Rupert Murdoch's phone hackers. What may have started last weekend as a clumsy piece of intimidation could have far wider consequences.

"(CNN) -- What a difference a Messi makes. Last weekend ""King Leo"" inspired Barcelona to a seven-goal victory on the opening day of the Spanish soccer season, but in his absence Sunday the reigning champions battled to beat Malaga 1-0. With the four-time world player of the year rested after suffering a bruised thigh in the midweek Spanish Super Cup draw with Atletico Madrid, new coach Gerardo Martino stuck to his word and left $75 million signing Neymar on the substitutes' bench. And without a recognized striker, Barca struggled to make the team's usual dominance of possession pay off -- the winner at Malaga came courtesy of a superb curling shot by defender Adriano from outside the penalty area. Neymar did get another run, but the 21-year-old Brazil star was unable to repeat his goal against Atletico as he was subjected to a series of rough challenges -- and had a late free-kick well-saved. Earlier, Xavi's free-kick was deflected against the Malaga crossbar, but Barca ultimately had keeper Victor Valdes to thank -- as well as the woodwork. Fabrice Olinga scrambled a shot that rebounded to safety off the post, then Sebastian Fernandez headed straight at Valdes when he should have equalized. The win left Barca top of the table on goal difference from Atletico, despite the Madrid side's 5-0 thrashing of Rayo Vallecano earlier Sunday. Raul Garcia scored in each half while Diego Costa, Arda Turan and Tiago also netted in a perfect warm-up for Wednesday's trip to the Nou Camp for the second leg of the Super Cup. Real Madrid can also move onto six points by beating Granada on Monday, ahead of the expected unveiling of Tottenham forward Gareth Bale in what is tipped to be a world-record transfer fee. Levante recovered from last week's drubbing by Barca, holding Sevilla 0-0, while Real Betis Celta Vigo beat Real Betis 2-1 in Sunday's late match despite having Borja Oubina sent off near the end. In Italy, Inter Milan beat Genoa 2-0 in Walter Mazzarri's first match in charge, with Japanese defender Yuto Nagatomo and Argentina forward Rodrigo Palacio scoring in the final 20 minutes. ""We must remember that these lads had gone four and a half months without winning at home, and there were lots of defeats in there too,"" former Napoli coach Mazzarri said, referring to the disastrous form which left Inter ninth in the table last season and well short of European qualification. ""We needed to shake off this fear that we'd concede on the first counter-attack. The players just needed a bit of belief."" Napoli's new coach Rafael Benitez also had a winning start as last season's runners-up beat Bologna 3-0, with two goals from Slovakian playmaker Marek Hamsik and the opener from former Real Madrid forward Jose Maria Callejon. French coach Rudy Garcia was similarly successful in his first match with Roma, coming away from promoted Livorno with a 2-0 win thanks to second-half goals from Daniele De Rossi and Alessandro Florenzi. Lazio, fifth in the previous campaign, bounced back from last weekend's 4-0 Italian Super Cup defeat by Juventus to beat Udinese 2-1. In France, champions Paris Saint-Germain won for the first time this season, beating Nantes 2-1 following two earlier draws. Edinson Cavani, an $84 million signing from Napoli, put PSG ahead in the first half before an own-goal by defender Alex, but Ezequiel Lavezzi pounced for a 74th-minute winner after Lucas' shot was blocked on the line. The result left Laurent Blanc's team four points behind top side Marseille and two behind second-placed Monaco. In Germany, Eintracht Frankfurt notched a first win this season, 2-0 at Eintracht Braunschweig which left the promoted side bottom of the table without a point. Stuttgart's 2-1 defeat by Augsburg left the five-time Bundesliga champions also on three losses.","Sunday's 1-0 win at Malaga keeps Barcelona top of La Liga .

"(CNN) -- Usually when we talk about the 1936 Olympics in Berlin we focus on two men -- Adolf Hitler and Jesse Owens -- and rightfully so. They are the two with an undeniable impact on history, albeit in vastly different ways. But in light of President Barack Obama's recent remarks on ""The Tonight Show"" denouncing Russia's new anti-gay laws, laws that have led to bloodshed in the streets, it is important that we remember Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller. They too were at those games. They too left a mark. You see, the day before they were scheduled to run in the 400-meter relay, their coach, Dean Cromwell, replaced them. They were not injured. They did not break any team rules nor were they disqualified for any violations. They were, however, Jewish, and this was Nazi Germany, which had adopted the Nuremberg laws limiting Jewish citizens' rights a year earlier. Apparently, Cromwell, along with leaders from the U.S. Olympic Committee, decided it would be best if Glickman and Stoller did not compete. At the time I'm sure it seemed like a decision that would only hurt the two men. After all, the 400, led by Owens, still won gold. Today we know better. Today we look at that decision and lower our heads in shame, understanding that it made us complicit with something that evolved into a far worse crime than unjustly replacing a pair of sprinters. In the moment when we should have spoken up, we remained silent. And so here we are again: an Olympics on the horizon, another host country with recently legislated laws persecuting a group of people, and for a while, we were silent. And then Tuesday happened. ""I've been very clear that when it comes to universal rights, when it comes to people's basic freedoms, that whether you are discriminating on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, you are violating the basic morality that I think should transcend every country,"" Obama said, going on to talk about how Russia's treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people goes against the spirit of the Olympics. He did not call for a boycott. But on Wednesday he canceled a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin planned for September. The White House cited Russia's decision to grant asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and ""lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control"" among other reasons. But it also mentioned human rights issues. Recently, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry received a letter from 88 members of Congress -- Republicans and Democrats -- urging him to do something to guarantee the safety of LGBT Americans visiting Russia during that time. That leaves 447 lawmakers we should be asking why they did not sign that letter. Last month Buzzfeed provided the world photos of LGBT people being violently beaten by anti-gay protesters and police in Russia. There are reports of LGBT teens being kidnapped, bullied, tortured and killed. Russian officials have said they don't condone the attacks, but police have stood by while they happened and then arrested the battered victims for being gay. And because it is unclear whether or not the anti-gay laws will be enforced during the Olympics, the safety of all Americans -- because you can be arrested if police think you look gay or even if you support gays -- is in question. Which brings me to: Why aren't the names of all 535 members of Congress on that letter? In talking about the 1936 Olympics, I do not equate what is happening in Russia to what happened to Jewish people during World War II. I just want to remind you that the Holocaust did not happen overnight. It was subtle. Surgical. In silence. These new anti-gay laws are disturbingly similar to the anti-Semitic Nuremberg laws Hitler passed before the 1936 Olympics. And with the Pew Institute finding 84% of Russians believe society should reject gay people, perhaps some saying they object to gays for fear of arrest, the world should question how far Russia intends to go. We should question how far Russia, our lukewarm ally, intends to go and what our participation in the 2014 Olympic Games will look like generations from now. In one of his final interviews before passing away in 2001, Glickman told the San Diego Jewish Press-Heritage that there had been some talk of boycotting the 1936 Olympics because of Hitler, but no one foresaw what would happen to the Jews a short time later. ""There is no way in the world that I would think of going to Nazi Germany,"" he said. ""The Holocaust and those things around Nazi Germany which we all loathe weren't in existence in 1936."" No one can predict the future. But this week Obama showed he learned an important lesson from our Olympic past -- offering silence to appease evil is a senseless endeavor because evil will never be satisfied. Now it's our turn to speak up. There are 447 members of Congress who have yet to sign that letter to Kerry -- we need to be asking why. Photos: Wrecking homes for an Olympic highway .

"(CNN) -- Indonesian police are searching for potentially hundreds of escaped inmates following a deadly prison riot in Medan, the capital of the province of North Sumatra. At least five people died, including two guards and three prisoners. More than 200 inmates, some of whom were jailed on terrorism charges, broke free from the maximum-security facility Thursday when the ""water supply was cut off because of a power outage,"" said Ronny Sompie, the National Police Spokesman Brigadier General. Angry prisoners, unable to bathe or use the bathroom, burned the door to the prison offices, stole guns and took guards hostage. ""The situation is under control and the fire at the prison has been extinguished,"" said Sompie. At least 55 prisoners have been recaptured. Some 800 police and military officials are now searching the surrounding area for escapees. ""It's unclear how many more escaped prisoners are out there. We're still waiting for the data from prison officials,"" Sompie said. The prison, Tanjung Gusta Correctional Institute, houses 2,600 inmates, according to a press statement from the Ministry of Law and Human Rights. The facility's maximum capacity is 1,054. Overcrowded prisons are typical in the country. Indonesia has made major progress in fighting once-rampant terrorism in the country. Since the first Bali bombings in 2002, authorities have arrested, convicted and jailed hundreds of terrorists. One of the terror networks behind past major attacks in Indonesia, Jemaah Islamiyah, has largely been weakened because of the arrests or deaths of its leaders. More recently, Indonesian police killed one of the country's most-wanted terrorists, Dulmatin, in March 2010. The suspected mastermind behind the 2002 Bali bombings, in which 202 people died, had a $10 million bounty on his head, according to the U.S. State Department. In April 2011, authorities in the capital of Jakarta foiled an Easter bomb plot targeting a Catholic church. Police found seven bombs made from about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of explosives. Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation. In October 2012, police arrested 11 people plotting a series of attacks that included the U.S. consulate in East Java as a target. Last month, Indonesian police foiled a plot to bomb the Myanmar Embassy in Jakarta, according to local media reports. The planned attack was reportedly in retribution for violence against Muslim Rohingya by majority Buddhists in Myanmar. Kathy Quiano contributed from Jakarta.

"London (CNN) -- David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, won a partial victory in his legal action against the Metropolitan Police Thursday, but the judge left a loophole that allows the police to continue investigating the materials they seized from him on Sunday. Miranda, a Brazilian citizen, spent nearly nine hours in detention Sunday being questioned under a provision of Britain's terrorism laws, after he was stopped as he changed planes on his way home from Berlin to Brazil. Authorities confiscated Miranda's electronic equipment, including his mobile phone, laptop, memory sticks, smart watch, DVDs and games consoles. The High Court order says that the inspection, copying, disclosure, transfer and distribution of the materials seized must cease, save for the purpose of protecting national security and for the purpose of investigating whether the claimant is a person who is, or has been, connected with terrorism. Opinion: Silence the media, compromise freedom . The Metropolitan Police said it is pleased that the High Court ""rejected an attempt to prevent further examination"" of the seized material. ""We welcome the decision of the court which allows our examination of the material -- containing thousands of classified intelligence documents -- to continue in order to protect life and national security,"" police said. Jonathan Laidlaw, a lawyer representing the Metropolitan Police, told the court a criminal investigation has been launched following inspection of the material seized from Miranda. ""Initial examination of material seized has identified highly sensitive material, the disclosure of which could put lives at risk,"" police said. ""As a result the Counter Terrorism Command ... has today begun a criminal investigation. This investigation is at an early stage and we are not prepared to discuss it in any further detail at this stage."" Speaking outside court, Miranda's lawyer Gwendolen Morgan, of the law firm Bindmans, described the ruling as a partial victory. She said she was not aware of any basis for the criminal investigation, adding that at no point during his detention was Miranda asked any questions about whether he was a terrorist. Miranda and his legal team will decide whether to appeal the ruling after the court provides its full reasoning, she said. The implications of this judgment are ""something journalists worldwide should be worried about,"" Morgan added. Miranda's partner, Greenwald, has been at the forefront of high-profile reports exposing secrets in U.S. intelligence programs, based on leaks from former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. 'Misuse' of terror law . Bindmans, which was hired by The Guardian to represent Miranda, filed the case to seek recovery of Miranda's property and prevent the government from inspecting the items or sharing what data it may have already gleaned from them. The High Court claim followed a written request to the Home Office and Metropolitan Police asking for assurances that the material will not be inspected, copied or shared with third parties. The UK authorities misused Section 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to detain Miranda, Morgan said in the court filing Wednesday. Their action was also in breach of European human rights law, she said. Miranda 'afraid' during questioning . The law firm was seeking an injunction against the government because it has not given the undertakings asked for, she said. ""The purpose of these proceedings is to protect the confidentiality of the sensitive journalistic material that was seized from the Claimant. Confidentiality, once lost, can clearly never be restored,"" she said. The British government has defended its actions in Miranda's case, saying it has a duty to ensure national security. The Metropolitan Police have called what happened ""legally and procedurally sound"" and said it came after ""a detailed decision-making process."" Evidence of pressure from prime minister . New evidence emerged Wednesday that the pressure placed on The Guardian over its reporting on information leaked by Snowden came from the highest levels of government. Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger told CNN on Wednesday how a senior British official who asked The Guardian to destroy hard drives containing leaked information about the NSA was ""acting on behalf of the prime minister,"" David Cameron. Rusbridger said the official has now been identified as Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood, and that he first contacted him in mid-June. ""He said he was acting on behalf of the prime minster,"" Rusbridger said. ""For about a period of a month, it was a cordial conversation."" But by mid-July, Rusbridger said, ""it became an explicit threat of legal action if we didn't either return the disks or destroy them."" The Guardian complied by destroying the hard drives. ""The point, which I explained to the British officials, was that Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian reporter, lives in Brazil,"" Rusbridger told CNN's Hala Gorani, who was sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. ""He has a copy, and we already have another copy in America. So destroying a copy in London wasn't going to stop us from reporting."" Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who heads the Liberal Democrats, Cameron's coalition partners, considered the authorities' request ""reasonable,"" his office said. â€ª""The Deputy Prime Minister felt this was a preferable approach to taking legal action,"" according to a statement issued Wednesday evening. ""He was keen to protect the Guardian's freedom to publish, whilst taking the necessary steps to safeguard security."" Miranda was stopped as he was returning to the couple's Rio de Janeiro home after staying in Berlin with filmmaker Laura Poitras, who has been working with Greenwald on NSA-related stories. Miranda has said he doesn't know what material he was carrying. He doesn't work for The Guardian, but the newspaper paid for his flights because he was helping his partner. He and Greenwald told CNN's Anderson Cooper of their distress and anger about his treatment at Heathrow Airport. ""To start detaining people who they think they are reporting on what they're doing under terrorism laws, that is as dangerous and oppressive as it gets,"" said Greenwald. Opinion: U.K. government and press collide in bullying of reporter's partner . CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote and Mick Krever and Andrew Carey reported in London. CNN's Bryony Jones and Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.","NEW: Police hail court's rejection of ""attempt to prevent further examination of material seized""

"(CNN) -- New Jersey's second winning ticket in the recent $448 million Powerball lottery jackpot has been presented and a third of the big prize claimed, state lottery officials said Monday. Having two winning jackpot tickets in the same state is rare -- the last time anything close to that happened was December 22, 1993, when two players in Washington, D.C., had winning tickets.

"(CNN) -- Have you ever put on a full-body wetsuit? It takes some time. Lots of pulling, tugging and wriggling around to get it in the perfect position. In early June, I raced my first triathlon relay, completing the swim and run portions. It took three people -- my mom, my sister and my relay partner -- to help me get into my wetsuit. I joked that day that it ""takes a village to get me in my wetsuit."" As with any joke, there is a kernel of truth in that statement. Upon hearing that I had been selected for the Fit Nation team, I immediately began to imagine what the upcoming months of training would hold. I envisioned myself running, biking, swimming and eating super-nutritious meals. In all of these scenarios, I was alone. After all, triathlon is not a team sport, right? Wrong. It takes a village to train for a triathlon, and I have an amazing tribe by my side! Reflecting on the sheer quantity, not to mention impeccable quality, of folks who are sharing this journey with me brings tears of gratitude to my eyes. Sometimes you just have to lose control . My relationship with my husband, Scott, has deepened through shared bike rides, running sessions and healthy meal planning. My 7-year old-daughter, Annissa, cheers me on at races, does squats and sit-ups with me and tells strangers her mommy is strong (and famous)! My local mentors, Geoff and Tracy Chandler, were strangers at this time last year. Now I can't imagine my life without them. Geoff has generously offered invaluable advice from his more than 30 years of racing experience. Tracy is my constant training buddy. We meet up for runs, rides and races, and she pushes me to get outside my comfort zone. Professional triathlete and Xterra world champ Lesley Paterson has become my friend and mentor. At her invitation, I participated in her extraordinary training boot camp. More important, I attended a talk Lesley gave about her journey to Xterra triathlon, in which she was brutally honest about her failures as well as her successes. Hearing an athlete at her level speak so openly of her struggles empowered me to take more risks, in triathlon and in other areas of my life. I met local coaches Doug Robinson and Heather Pickey at my second triathlon relay. They offered to help me with my swim form through weekly clinics they hold at my local YMCA. Their expertise and encouragement is taking my swim fitness to the next level. Work out what matters most: your mind . Laura Minor, owner of a local boutique gym, has welcomed me with open arms. I strength train there three times a week with trainer Cori McCorkle. Cori's enthusiasm for my triathlon challenge is undeniable. She spends time researching new exercises geared toward triathletes to maximize my gym time. Laura and Cori are not only helping me build muscle; they are helping me build confidence. I've rekindled old friendships and moved existing friendships forward. Instead of meeting for dinner and drinks, I bike with my friend Jayme and go to Spin class with my pal Sarah. While on vacation in Tucson in April, I met up with my former colleague Melinda for a run. I'm currently making plans for a long bike ride with Damian, a friend from primary school. You can build your own village. Tell friends about your goals and invite them to training sessions. Talk to strangers at the gym, on the track, on the trail and at your race. Introduce yourself, ask them about their training goals, and surround yourself with friends and supporters who help move you forward. And give back. As you gain experience, share your knowledge with new athletes. So what's stopping you? Take the first step and tell the world you are ready to tri. You'll be amazed at how quickly your village will grow. Follow McMahon on Twitter @TriHardTabitha .","When she joined Fit Nation, Tabitha McMahon imagined running, biking, swimming alone .

"(CNN) -- Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel will serve a half-game suspension for an ""inadvertent violation regarding the signing of certain autographs,"" the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the university said Wednesday.

In addition to serving his suspension, Manziel will address the team about lessons learned, and Texas A&M will revise its education concerning student-athlete autographs. ""Student-athletes are often asked for autographs from fans, but unfortunately, some individuals' sole motivation in seeking an autograph is for resale,"" NCAA Vice President of Academic and Membership Affairs Kevin Lennon said in the statement.

"London (CNN) -- Many kids manage to slip away from their parents in shopping centers during summer vacations, but an 11-year-old boy from Manchester, England, got farther away than most this week. He went to Manchester Airport, snuck past passport control and boarding pass checks, went though a metal detector and was on a plane halfway to Rome before anyone realized there was anything unusual going on, an airport spokesman said Wednesday.

""He got himself to the airport. It looks like he evaded some passport checks and some boarding pass checks and ended up in Rome,"" Greenway said. FBI: Stowaway slops onto cross-country flight .

"New York (CNN) -- The New York Times on Saturday endorsed Christine Quinn, a Democrat, and Joseph Lhota, a Republican, ahead of the primary elections to determine who will run to succeed New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The endorsements by the renowned newspaper could have substantial influence on the September 10 primary elections for each party. Quinn, the City Council speaker and one of seven Democrats in the primary race, ""offers the judgment and record of achievement anyone should want in a mayor,"" the newspaper said. ""She has shepherded through important laws protecting New Yorkers' health, safety and civil rights, including measures banning public smoking, protecting tenants and small businesses, and battling slumlords. She sponsored the sweeping 2007 legislation that made the city's exemplary campaign-finance laws even stronger,"" the Times endorsement said. The newspaper gave credit to two other Democratic candidates, Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, and former comptroller William Thompson Jr., but said the editorial board had already been set to endorse Quinn even before what they believed was her impressive performance in a debate Wednesday. ""We are honored to have the endorsement of the New York Times. The endorsement makes clear that Christine Quinn hasn't just talked about being a progressive, she has a long record of fighting for New York's progressive values and she has delivered results every step of the way,"" said Mike Morey, spokesman for the campaign. According to the latest NBC 4 NY/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey released on August 16, de Blasio and Quinn are currently tied in the polls. If no candidate obtains the required 40% of the vote, the top two will hold a runoff on Oct. 1. The crowded Democratic field includes former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner. The Times called Republican candidate Joe Lhota, once right-hand man to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former chairman of the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority, ""the best qualified of the three men seeking the Republican nomination for mayor."" ""Few people know better than Mr. Lhota how city government works. He was an expert budget director for Mr. Giuliani, and then became deputy mayor for operations,"" the Times said. ""In 2011 and 2012, he ran the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which, under his leadership, recovered amazingly quickly from the damage done by Hurricane Sandy,"" the paper said. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","New York Times issues mayoral endorsements .

"(CNN) -- On the surface, water polo appears an elegant pursuit played by extremely polished performers. But beneath the water line, a different storyline is playing out. Limbs bash against each other, punches and kicks are thrown, nails are used to claw at an opponent and every so often, a player inadvertently disrobes another. The thing is, like most players, Australian goal-machine Rowena Webster wouldn't want it any other way. ""We have a running joke that the referees probably only see about 20% of what really happens,"" Webster told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I guess what you can get away with is what you can get away with but there's a lot of pulling, grabbing, bathers get ripped off. ""Anything to get that little advantage over your opponent I guess is a win. We do get our nails checked before each game to kind of limit the amount of scratches we can give to our opponents. ""That's not to say it doesn't happen, and there are a lot of kicks and holds and punches that also do go on under the water. ""We're really friendly out of the water but as soon as we get into that pool anything is possible."" Webster thrives in this school of hard knocks and is the hot shot in front of goal for her national team, known as the Aussie Stingers. Bronze medalists at the London 2012 Olympics, they fell narrowly short of gold at the World Championships in Barcelona, losing 8-6 to host nation Spain in last weekend's final. The 25-year-old was top scorer in Spain with 16 and was selected in the team of the tournament upon its conclusion. She has over 150 caps for her country -- a source of immense pride. ""I feel free when I play water polo,"" Webster explains. ""There's something in me that just lets go of everything, I forget about everything. ""I'm in the moment. I love playing for Australia and I get excited every time I cap up for Australia. I just love being competitive. ""I'm pretty stubborn. I don't even like to lose a game of Monopoly, so winning's always on the top of my priority list."" Not only does water polo require finesse, vision, excellent hand-eye coordination and strength, it also requires bundles of stamina. Players are only allowed to use one hand with which to catch and throw the ball and must tread water for all four quarters of the match -- over half an hour at Olympic level. To do so, they employ a technique that goes by the wonderful name of eggbeating. But what it is exactly? ""The eggbeater is, I guess, what your mum does at home when she's trying to whip some cream up -- we kind of have our legs going,"" Webster explains. ""It's almost like we're pedaling, but we're pedaling out wide, so if you imagine you're pedaling on a bike and then just making sure it's going out wide. ""It's almost like you're sitting on the toilet. You're beating an egg with your legs."" Water polo is a game she has grown into. The Melbourne native's own evaluation of her game in the early days is ""pretty shocking."" But her appetite for the game and determination to improve intensified after the Australian women's team won gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics when the nation was swept away by Games fever. By the age of 13 Webster was playing for her state, Victoria, and by 16 she was representing her country, captaining Australia to the Junior World Championships title in 2007. Yet there is no doubt as to what she regards as the pinnacle of her career to date -- that third-placed finish at London 2012. ""My proudest moment is 100% being at the Olympics and winning a bronze medal,"" she said. ""That's definitely been the highlight of my career and to do it at the highest level was amazing. ""The Olympics is that pinnacle and so just to do it there, in front of a really supportive crowd was just incredible -- I get chills thinking about it now."" When in full flow, water polo can be quite a frenetic business, so Webster and her teammates have engineered unique ways of communicating during the game. ""We yell at each other. It can be a challenge to hear with the crowd and the water in your ears and we also like to point at each other,"" she said. ""Then if that doesn't work, we usually just splash each other!"" While obviously disappointed at missing out on gold at the World Championships, Webster was an integral part of her country's best return since 2007, when the Stingers also took silver. And she hopes Australia's performance can entice more youngsters into the sport that continues to provide her with that enchanting sense of freedom. ""For the sport of women's water polo, I hope that it gets more and more exposure,"" she added. ""I truly believe it's one of the best sports there is to play for men or women and there are such great women's teams out there. ""I hope that a lot of females look towards those idols and say, 'I do want to play this sport and I do want to play for my country.' ""I just hope it gets bigger and bigger and hopefully one day, it'll be a paid sport.""","Rowena Webster is chief goalscorer for Australia's women's water polo team .

"(CNN) -- In 2008, the future looked bright for Breno. A sought-after Brazilian soccer star, the teenager was leaving his homeland and heading to Germany to sign for one of Europe's most famous teams, Bayern Munich. But four years later the defender's career, and his life, had unraveled. In July 2012 he was sentenced to three years and nine months in prison for burning down his Munich villa while reportedly battling depression. ""The time in prison has been very hard for me,"" confessed Breno at a news conference on Monday. Now aged 23, the former Sao Paulo star has been offered a shot at redemption. Having served 13 months of his sentence, Breno is being allowed to leave prison on day release and has been given the chance to rejoin Bayern as part of the coaching staff at the club's youth academy. ""I'm a little nervous,"" added Breno. ""But I'm in good shape now. I'm delighted, and I'd like to thank the prison authorities and Bayern for this chance."" Breno will be collected from the correctional facility in Stadelheim at 0830 every morning by Bayern youth director Wolfgang Dremmler and returned at 1330. Blog: Can Moyes meet Man Utd challenge? The length of his day release could be extended to eight hours in a couple of months, according to Bayern's website. ""I think it's excellent that the prison authorities and all the authorities in Munich involved in the case have helped to open up this opportunity,"" said Bayern president Uli Hoeness. The opportunity Breno has been given at Bayern, and the fitness work he has been doing in prison, could see the former Brazil under-23 player given an unexpected chance to resurrect his career. Former club Sao Paulo were in Munich for the Audi Cup, a preseason tournament held at Bayern's Allianz Arena, and they opened the door for Breno to return to his former club. Reports in December 2012 went as far as to suggest Sao Paulo had already offered Breno a contract, despite his incarceration. A playing career back in Brazil might be the only option for Breno, with Hoeness claiming he will face deportation from Germany on his release from prison. Breno hasn't played a professional match since coming on as a substitute in Bayern's 5-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen on April 17, 2011, but he will be allowed to work on his fitness in conjunction with his coaching duties. ""It means I can train again and maybe play again later on -- that's my dream,"" said Breno, while Hoeness confirmed, ""at the Audi Cup, the people from Sao Paulo confirmed their strong interest in that."" Hoeness assured Breno he will receive Bayern's full backing, despite no long being under contract at the club. ""FC Bayern will do everything it can to help,"" said Hoeness. ""We've been informed by the prison authorities that he has behaved impeccably and has been an exemplary prisoner. His behavior here will be just as flawless.""","Incarcerated player Breno to work with Bayern Munich's young players .

"(CNN) -- Kevin Rudd returned as prime minister of Australia on Thursday, three years after being replaced in the office by his then-deputy Julia Gillard. Rudd challenged Gillard for leadership of the Labor Party on Wednesday and won a 57-45 vote among fellow Labor members of parliament. In the Australian parliamentary system, the leader of the governing party assumes the position of prime minister and on Thursday morning, in Canberra, Rudd was sworn in for a second time. Gillard resigned after the party vote on Wednesday night and announced she will leave politics. A major factor in Gillard's demise -- and in Rudd's Phoenix-like return -- is the election Australia has to hold by the end of this year. Under Gillard's leadership, Labor was facing overwhelming defeat, according to opinion polls. But the same polls show a Rudd-led Labor Party would fare much better at the ballot box. Australian Governor-General Quentin Bryce oversaw the swearing-in ceremony at Government House in Canberra. The governor-general represents Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. Rudd is widely popular with Australian voters, who go to the polls in September to pick a new parliament and government. Gillard had called for the vote herself after months of inner-party friction. Rudd, who was elected in 2007 but was ousted by Gillard in a leadership challenge in 2010, said he returns to the office of prime minister with ""humility, with honor and with an important sense of energy and purpose."" Julia Gillard: Admired abroad, vilified at home . He said the negative politics holding Australia back in recent years ""must stop,"" and that he will strive to achieve this goal as prime minister. He also paid tribute to Gillard as ""a woman of extraordinary intelligence, of great strength and great energy,"" and said she had achieved remarkable reforms despite heading a minority government. In her own news conference, Gillard said she was grateful to have had the opportunity to lead her country. ""This privilege was truly humbling. I thank the Australian Labor Party for that privilege and I thank the Australian people for their support,"" she said. ""When I first put myself forward for consideration for Labor leader in 2010, I had the overwhelming support of my colleagues to do so. I thank them for that. And I thank them for giving the opportunity to me not only to serve the nation but to serve as the first female prime minister of this country."" Tony Abbott, leader of the official opposition Liberal Party of Australia, accused the ALP of focusing on politics over good government. In a news conference, he said the people of Australia ""deserve better than this,"" and appealed for voters to back his party if they want a strong, stable and unified government. ""Just a couple of simple facts,"" Abbott said. ""In 2007, you voted for Kevin and got Julia. In 2010, you voted for Julia and got Kevin. If you vote for the Labor Party in 2013, who knows who you will end up with?"" Referring to the upcoming election battle, Rudd said he had finally decided to contest his party's leadership because ""it's simply not in my nature to stand idly by and to allow an Abbott government to come to power in this country by default."" Reluctant Rudd . The internal leadership vote followed months of rivalry and division within the ALP. Rudd's supporters within the ALP circulated a petition calling for him to challenger Gillard's leadership, but he initially refrained. In the meantime, at least eight of the ministers in Gillard's Cabinet resigned, purging decades of experience from her government. This week, the prime minister had had enough. Despite no official challenge from any rival, she put her power on the chopping block and handed her party the ax. ""I do think it's in the best interests of the nation -- and in the best interests of the Labor Party -- for this matter to be resolved,"" she said as she called the vote. In a jab at her rival, Gillard complained in an interview with CNN affiliate Sky News Australia this week that no one had approached her to mount a leadership ballot in a traditional manner. ""Call me old-fashioned, but the way in which these things are normally done is a challenger approaches the leader of the Labor Party and asks them to call a ballot for the leadership, you shake hands and then a ballot is held,"" she said. Gillard called for any challengers to put their names on the ballot, which would be the last one she would call to challenge her position. Three hours before the vote, Rudd picked up the gauntlet. ""Various ministers have been free and frank in their public advice to me as to the desirability to contest the leadership in recent days. For the nation's sake, I believe it's time for this matter to be resolved,"" he said in a statement sent to journalists. Rudd said he would not use his win against party rivals but would focus on uniting the party. Loser leaves . In March, Gillard threw down a similar challenge to her power as the rivalry sapped strength from her government. Rudd refused back then to challenge her, and she won the vote of confidence from her party and kept her job. March: Embattled Australian PM losing allies despite vote win . But she continued to lose support within her party. In her interview with Sky News, Gillard said the loser of Wednesday's vote should get out of the way for the sake of a functioning government. ""If you win, you're Labor leader,"" she said. ""If you lose, you retire from politics."" In her post-vote news conference, Gillard confirmed she will not seek to retain her constituency seat in the general election.

"(CNN) -- Laszlo Csatary, the Nazi war crimes suspect who was arrested last year, has died, his lawyer told Hungarian media. He was 98. Csatary was accused of sending more than 15,000 Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp in the spring of 1944. ""With the death of Csatary there are no further proceedings in this case,"" lawyer Gabor Horvath told Hungarian state news agency MTI. He said Csatary died Saturday. Csatary was arrested in June 2012 after a Jewish rights organization discovered him living in Budapest. The Simon Wiesenthal Center considered him its most-wanted Nazi war criminal. ""This is a very unfortunate end to a saga that lasted far too long,"" Efraim Zuroff, director of the center's Israel office, said Monday. ""Csatary should have been brought to justice shortly after the war. ... We gave the Hungarian prosecutors evidence two years ago, and this should have been taken care of months ago in Budapest."" Csatary served as a senior Hungarian police officer in the city of Kosice, which is now in Slovakia but was under Hungarian rule in the 1940s, the center said. In addition to the Auschwitz deportations, Csatary was accused of participating in the deportations of 300 Jews to the Ukraine to be killed, Zuroff said. Using the last name Csizsik, Csatary arrived in Canada in 1949, telling immigration officials he was Yugoslavian, according to The Toronto Star newspaper. Canadian authorities later investigated allegations that he had lied to immigration authorities about his past when he arrived there. Canada revoked his citizenship in 1997 and initiated an investigation. Csatary voluntarily left Canada amid deportation proceedings and returned to Hungary. After receiving tips from Zuroff, Hungarian authorities launched an investigation on Csatary in September 2011, the center said. Csatary denied allegations against him to the British tabloid The Sun.

"(CNN) -- Two-time champion Venus Williams is out of the U.S. Open following a battling 6-3 2-6 7-6 (7-5) second-round defeat to world No. 56 Zheng Jie. Former world No. 1 Williams, currently ranked 60th, fought bravely against her Chinese opponent before eventually losing in three hours and two minutes. The marathon encounter was the joint fifth-longest women's singles match in the tournament's history. In recent years Williams has struggled with form and fitness and entered the New York tournament with a back injury. She was diagnosed with the auto-immune disorder Sjogren's Syndrome at Flushing Meadows two years ago. ""I think there's a lot of positives for me out of this tournament. I continue to serve better and recover [from] my back injury with each tournament,"" the 33-year-old told the event's official website. ""I'll just continue to step up and give myself chances. A lot of times I'm putting myself in a good position but not always capitalizing. So I'll get there. I just have to keep working at it."" Williams' compatriot Sloane Stephens is at the opposite end of her career and the 15th seed continued her rise to prominence with a commanding 6-1 6-1 defeat of Poland's Urszula Radwanska. ""I came out with a really good attitude and I think it showed,"" said the 20-year-old, who plays fellow American and 23rd seed Jamie Hampton in the second round. ""I think every point was the only thing on my mind. That's what happens when you really, really, really want to win."" Third seed Agnieszka Radwanska, Urszula's older sister, fared better than her sibling, beating 103-ranked Spaniard Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor 6-0 7-5. In the men's draw defending champion Andy Murray made light work of his first-round match with Frenchman Michael Llodra. The 2013 Wimbledon winner, seeded third, secured a 6-2 6-4 6-3 win to set up a tie with Argentina's Leandro Mayer. ""I felt comfortable before the match. I didn't feel any extra pressure, which was good,"" said Murray, who is defending a grand slam title for the first time. ""I was just ready to play... There were no of unknowns out there on the court. I've played many matches there ... I didn't feel loads of nerves before the match. I just wanted to get on."" American veteran James Blake bid farewell to his home grand slam with an agonizing five-set loss against Croatia's Ivo Karlovic.

"(CNN) -- Arriving for our interview in Berlin this week, Wolfgang Schaeuble seemed eager to be back on the campaign trail. Fresh from his summer break on the North Sea island of Sylt, the German finance minister effortlessly slipped back into what has now become a familiar routine: fielding questions about the eurozone . When asked if he foresaw any more bailouts, Schaeuble said ""No, no I don't see, the problems are not solved but we are in a much better shape than we used to be some years ago."" He pointed to the falling costs of sovereign debt and lower budget deficits across the common currency bloc and ruled out any more haircuts on outstanding government debt. With Germany heading towards elections on September 22, Chancellor Angela Merkel is enjoying unprecedented popularity. Her approval rating is 63% -- more than double that of her nearest rival, former finance minister and now SPD leader Peer Steinbrueck. The chances of a non-Merkel win may be slim. Read more: Full coverage of euro crisis . However, as per Germany's political tradition, whoever emerges victorious will have to form a coalition with one of the other parties, thus clouding the policy outlook for those on the outside looking in. ""I hope we will win,"" Schaeuble told me, then adding: ""We have to fight [but] I think the general mood is in favor of us."" Germany's government is in a curious position of having to serve two constituencies: one it's elected for and another over which it has no formal mandate but a lot of financial sway. As the dominant economy in Europe, Germany has been pivotal in helping to fund and direct troubled member states but its leader has to balance that with her nation's reluctance to be viewed as the rich relative. Read more: Recession over but don't celebrate yet . In this Schaeuble is steadfast: ""If Chancellor Merkel [is] re-elected I am confident that we will continue to work for a stronger Europe -- that's our general position,"" he said. ""We don't want a German Europe but we want a strong Europe and that means every member state including Germany has to increase its competitiveness."" That, he said was about each country doing its duty and ensuring it did ""not to ask for more money by others -- that's the wrong way to get a strong Europe, that's the wrong incentive."" Since Greece was granted its first bailout in 2010 troubled eurozone countries have been granted around 440 billion euros in financial assistance. The cash has been funnelled through the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union in exchange for promises to rein in spending and debt. Germany, which has the deepest pockets, is on the hook for the lion's share of the support -- and as election fever sets in, so has bailout fatigue. Watch more: Sorrell: Why we need strong leadership . Schaeuble reopened old wounds this month by saying Greece would need a third aid program, though when asked by CNN he wouldn't be drawn on the size of the offer, saying it was too early to speculate. However, Greece's Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said the country could be looking for an extra 10 billion euros in aid. It's a figure close to the 11 billion euro shortfall already identified by the IMF, whose 3-year program is set to end next year. As part of a multi-pronged approach to contain the eurozone's existential crisis, leaders have tried to shore up its financial sector by creating a banking union as well as a contingency fund for countries in distress. Read more: Greece may need another 10 billion euros . When combined with the ECB's commitment to ""do what it takes"" to protect confidence in the single currency, such actions may have averted the worst for now. But Schaeuble is under no illusions that without coordinated budgets for the country's using the single currency, the euro will always be vulnerable. I asked him if the move toward closer fiscal cooperation has left the eurozone more politically divided than it has been in its recent history. Schaeuble told me problems arose if there not a solid fiscal framework, saying the bloc has ""made a lot of progress ..to get better conditions, better rules for common fiscal policy."" One thing Schaeuble cannot deny is the benefits to the country's legendary export machine from the weaker currency. Thanks to its flailing adherents, the euro has been less strong than a deutsche mark would have been. However, Schaeuble also pointed to the lower interest rates enjoyed by the countries in Southern Europe. Read more: Tiny nation bucking eurozone's problems . Schaeuble's euro-speak is as fluent and comes from one who has both experience and economic clout. Yet up until now it's a language that hasn't dominated Germany's campaign literature, which has instead been focused on issues like creating jobs, wages and the housing market. Of course the great irony is that while Germany may be looking inwards this election, the world is keeping its eyes peeled for its next move. Just ask Germany's neighbors. They have relied on her in times of crisis, and they will also look to her for the path to recovery.","CNN's Nina dos Santos sat down for a rare interview with German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble .

"(CNN) -- On June 2, 2011, I began my quest for the presidency on the farm of Doug and Stella Scamman in Stratham, New Hampshire. I said then that our country is a land of freedom and opportunity. I spoke of the hard work of the millions of Americans who built our remarkable experiment in self-government. They carved out of the wilderness a land of immense prosperity and unlimited potential. I said then that ""I believe in America."" For more than a year now, I've carried that message across America. As we draw close to Election Day, it is a good moment to reflect on what it means to believe in America. America is a place where freedom rings. It is a place where we can discuss our differences without fear of any consequence worse than criticism, where we can believe in whatever creed or religion we choose, where we can pursue our dreams no matter how small or grand. It is a place that not only cherishes freedom, but is willing to fight to defend it. These are the qualities that define us. America is a land of opportunity. But lately, for too many Americans, opportunity has not exactly come knocking. We've been mired in an economic slowdown that has left millions of our fellow citizens unemployed. The consequences in dreams shattered, lives disrupted, plans deferred, and hopes dimmed can be found all around us. It hasn't always been this way. It certainly doesn't have to be this way in the future. We're all in this together. And together we can emerge from these troubles. President Obama's op-ed: My vision for America . Together with Paul Ryan, I've put forward an economic recovery plan consisting of five central elements that will in four years create 12 million jobs. · We will produce more of the energy we need to heat our homes, fill our cars, and make our economy grow.  We will stop President Obama's war on coal, his disdain for oil, and his effort to crimp natural gas by federal regulation of the very technology that produces it. We will support nuclear and renewables, but phase out subsidies once an industry is on its feet. We will invest in energy science and research to make discoveries that can actually change our energy world. By 2020, we will achieve North American energy independence. · We will retrain our work force for the jobs of tomorrow and ensure that every child receives a quality education no matter where they live, including especially our inner cities. Parents and students, not administrators and unions, need to have greater choice. Our current worker retraining system is a labyrinth of federal programs that sprawls across 47 programs and nine agencies. We will eliminate this redundancy and empower the 50 states and the private sector to develop effective programs of their own. · We will make trade work for America.  We'll open more markets to American agriculture, products, and services. And we will finally hold accountable any nation that doesn't play by the rules.  I will stand up for the rights and interests of American workers and employers. Your turn: What's your vision for America? · We will restore fiscal sanity to Washington by bringing an end to the federal spending and borrowing binge that in just four years has added more debt held by the public than almost all previous administrations combined. We will put America on track to a balanced budget by eliminating unnecessary programs, by sending programs back to states where they can be managed with less abuse and less cost, and by shrinking the bureaucracy of Washington. · Finally, we will champion small business, the great engine of job creation in our country, by reforming the tax code and updating and reshaping regulations that have suffocated economic growth. Nothing is ever easy in Washington, but these goals are rooted in bipartisan agreement, and I will work with members of both parties to accomplish them.  As governor of a state that was overwhelmingly Democratic, I was always ready to reach across the aisle and I can proudly point to the results. I've learned that when we come together to solve problems in a practical spirit, we can accomplish miracles. In this respect, I am offering a contrast to what we are seeing in Washington today. We've watched as one party has pushed through its agenda without compromising with the other party. We've watched gridlock and petty conflict dominate while the most important issues confronting the nation, like chronic high unemployment, go unaddressed. The bickering has to end. I will end it.  I will reach across the aisle to solve America's problems. Our economic crisis not only threatens the well-being of our citizenry, it has larger consequences in other realms. The economic weakness of the past several years has, alarmingly, fostered weakness in our foreign policy posture. Runaway domestic spending has led the president to propose reducing defense spending by hundreds of billions, cuts that his own secretary of defense has said would ""devastate"" our national security. The most important task for any president is set out in the preamble to our Constitution—providing for the common defense. As commander-in-chief, I will roll back the president's deep and arbitrary cuts to our military. Our soldiers should never lack the tools they need to complete their mission and come home safely. I have always believed that the first purpose of a strong military is to prevent war. And preventing war is a supreme national interest. I will ensure that our military is strong enough that no adversary dares to challenge us. Let us remember our history. We have accomplished so much, both in the world and at home. We've defeated tyrannies. We've lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty. We've transformed our own society into a more perfect union. We've created a land of freedom and prosperity. The problems we need to overcome now are not bigger than we are. We can defeat them.  I am offering real change and a real choice. Whose vision do you find more compelling? Vote on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- When the winner of the women's singles at the U.S. Open picks up her check for $2.6 million -- buck for buck the same as the men's champion -- she might well reflect that, if not for Billie Jean King's pioneering efforts, those riches might not exist. Supreme champion on the court, battler for equality off it, King took on the male-dominated tennis establishment and won. She was the driving force behind the formation of the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) in 1973, the same year she famously beat former men's grand slam champion Bobby Riggs in the ""Battle of the Sexes"" match in Houston. ""Everybody should thank her and shake her hand,"" King's fellow tennis icon Chris Evert told CNN's Open Court. ""She put money in our pockets and provided a living for hundreds and hundreds of female athletes. ""Tennis is the frontrunner in all sports in equality, so she deserves all of the credit."" 40th anniversary . Forty years on, King, who turns 70 in November, has been celebrating the WTA's anniversary in a series of events which defined the role of women not just in sport, but in society itself. The fledgling Virginia Slims tennis circuit for women professionals had been established at the start of the 1970s, but the leading players like King and Australian Margaret Court -- the all-time leading grand slam singles winner -- were still paid a fraction of the prize money available to their male counterparts. The men had formed their own union -- the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) in 1972 -- and King was convinced it needed to be replicated for women. Using her famous powers of persuasion, and with help from other key figures such as Dutchwoman Betty Stove, compatriots Rosie Casals and Nancy Ritchey and Britain's Ann Jones, a meeting was convened at the Gloucester Hotel in London, just before the Wimbledon championships. Within a few short hours, the articles of the association were signed and the WTA was born. Player power . ""We finally all came together as one voice and having the power of one -- you know just one group. It made such a difference,"" King told CNN. Martina Navratilova was then just starting out on her incredible career, and it was only later that she appreciated the significance of what had happened. ""My first year playing -- 1973, my first Wimbledon -- I had no idea what the association was, but being American and being a bit older, Billie Jean again had the foresight to get us organized just in time,"" the Czechoslovakia-born Navratilova told CNN. Already an influential figure in the United States and helped by her then husband Larry, an astute lawyer, King had threatened to boycott the 1973 U.S. Open if equal prize money was not awarded. As defending champion, King had considerable leverage and the organizers gave in to her demands. When Court won the 1973 title she received the same prize purse -- $25,000 -- as the men's champion. Male chauvinism . But this concession was the exception rather than the rule in major sports. Such male chauvinism was personified by former Wimbledon champion Riggs, a shameless self publicist, who made a fortune from gambling on his own tennis matches. Seeing an opportunity to make more money, Riggs challenged both Court and King, claiming that even in middle age -- he was 55 -- he could beat the top women players. King ignored him at first, but Court took up the challenge and played him in a match in California on May 13, 1973. King had realized the significance of the occasion and had done her best to encourage the Australian to take it seriously. ""I said, 'Margaret it's not a tennis match, it's about social change, it's about social justice, it's about all the things we're working for,' and she goes, 'I don't'. She wasn't politically orientated! Riggs match . ""So Margaret played him Mother's Day in 1973 and lost (6-1 6-2). it's called the Mother's Day massacre and I just thought, 'Oh no!' "" King needed no second bidding, and the famous ""Battle of the Sexes"" match came to fruition on September 20 in the Houston Astrodome. ""I thought it would set us back 50 years if I didn't win that match,"" said King. ""It would ruin the women's tour and affect the self esteem of all women."" The entrances -- King on a gold litter in the style of Cleopatra, Riggs on a rickshaw pulled by women models in skimpy outfits -- added to the theater. Once the match started, King, at 29 and the peak of her powers, made her opponent eat his earlier words and boasts. With a winner-take-all $100,000 check riding on the outcome, Riggs lost his nerve and was beaten 6-4 6-3 6-3. Iconic moment . ""The drop shot and volley heard around the world,"" said Britain's Times newspaper as an estimated global TV audience of 50 million watched the rout. King and Riggs embraced at the end, and became friends off the court until his death in 1995 of prostate cancer. Prior to the WTA's formation, King had realized the significance of legislation passed through the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and signed into law by President Richard Nixon in June 1972. Title IX made it a requirement under law for male and female students to be afforded equal federal funding in their high school and college studies. ""Before that, young women were not getting anything, there was gender quotas -- like 5% in the medical school at Harvard -- there were really terrible gender quotas and also women could not get an athletic scholarship in the States,"" said King. ""Now because of Title IX, women from all over the world can go to our American colleges on a scholarship and get grants. It's very powerful because it's about equality in education and activities, and sports comes under activities."" Quantum leap . According to 18-time grand slam singles winner Navratilova, King took advantage of the mood of the moment to push through changes which were ahead of their time. ""Billie Jean, she just pushed the clock forward, she sped up the process,"" Navratilova said. ""Any progress is measured by jumps, and that was one of those jumps that pushed the clock forward and allowed us to move forward as women athletes and to make a career out of it so it wasn't just a hobby. "" King was to play competitive singles for 10 more years after her 1973 heroics on and off the court, but injuries took their toll. Her final grand slam singles triumph came at Wimbledon in 1975, her sixth success on the grass at SW19, but victory in the women's doubles at the 1980 U.S. Open competed her set of 39 major titles overall. A firm believer in the team ethic, she played for and captained the U.S. in the Wightman and Federation Cup competitions, while King and her husband Larry were founding partners of World Team Tennis in 1974. Team ethic . The format of that competition sees men and women playing a five-set competition in a mix of singles, doubles and mixed doubles. It has proved a successful formula, with the franchises playing to big crowds across the United States. For King, the whole ethos of the event sums up her attitude to life and equality. ""That's the way I want the world to look: men and women working together, championing each other, helping each other, promoting each other -- we're all in this world together,"" she said. The fight she started for equal prize money in the grand slams took 34 years to reach its fruition when Wimbledon became the last of the four to fall into line in 2007. ""I remember the fight for prize money, I remember how many meetings were set, how many battles we had, and we all seemed to have stood by what we believed was right,"" Maria Sharapova told CNN when a unique meeting of former No. 1s gathered at Wimbledon to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the WTA. Sharapova, who has become the highest earning female athlete in the world, acknowledged that she and the current leading players owe a lot to King. Grateful thanks . ""She had a big role obviously, there is a lot to be grateful for,"" she said. King shows no sign of slowing up, with her commitments to World Team Tennis and various foundations. In 2009, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and found out that President Barack Obama was a fan of hers from time she spent in Hawaii when he was young. ""It's funny because he actually watched me practice at his high school. He told me when I met him for the first time,"" added King, who was honored for her work advocating for the rights of women and the lesbian and gay community. She was divorced from Larry King in 1987 and her current partner Ilana Kloss is a former professional on the WTA Tour. Life's goals . Even as a precocious teenager on the public courts of Long Beach in California in the late 1950s, King had decided her priorities. ""I had an epiphany about our sport. I really wanted to spend the rest of my life fighting for equal rights and opportunities for boys and girls, men and women,"" said King. ""I always knew if I could ever be No. 1 in tennis, I'd have a platform."" King has used that platform to great effect and the current No. 1, Serena Williams, remains her biggest fan. ""Billie Jean has been my ultimate inspiration,"" Williams, who will start the defense of her U.S. Open title in New York next week, told CNN. ""I had the honor of playing when she was Fed Cup captain and I learned so much from her. ""Not just women's tennis but women's sport would be greatly diminished if it wasn't for Billie Jean."" But it's been a journey that has taken its toll even on someone as outwardly tough as King. ""I've stood up but I'm scared a lot. I'm really scared a lot,"" she revealed. ""I felt very alone, very isolated at times but you know what -- I always felt like we were trying to do the right thing then I didn't care so much what people thought.""","Billie Jean King is a 12-time grand slam singles champion .

"(CNN) -- German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble says the eurozone's problems are not solved, but ""we are in a much better shape than we used to be some years ago."" Asked whether he foresaw any further bailouts coming, he replied: ""No, no I don't see."" In a rare interview, conducted in English, he said: ""If Chancellor Merkel (is) reelected I am confident that we will continue to work for a stronger Europe -- that's our general position. We don't want a German Europe but we want a strong Europe and that means every member state including Germany has to increase its competitiveness,"" Schaeuble said. ""A stronger Europe means that everyone has to do its duty and not to ask for more money by others -- that's the wrong way to get a strong Europe, that's the wrong incentive."" His comments come ahead of the September 22 election, as Merkel faces a German electorate weary of Europe's largest economy helping to bail out troubled eurozone nations, whose debt woes have threatened the stability of the currency. Greece, along with three other eurozone countries -- Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus -- remain dependent on rescue loans from the EU and International Monetary Fund (IMF). The 17-nation eurozone has emerged from its longest ever recession, growing 0.3% in the second quarter after 18 months of contraction. Unemployment rates remain high, but worries that the debt crisis could spread to larger economies such as Spain and Italy -- which both saw borrowing costs climb dangerously high last year -- have abated. ""You can see if you look at the rates for sovereign debts they are stable. Markets have confidence in the stability of the eurozone as a whole. And economies are recovering in the whole of the eurozone and the average deficit has been halved in all member states of the eurozone in the last three years."" Schaeuble acknowledged that Greece will need further assistance, but said there will be no further ""hair cuts"" -- such as 100 billion euros in losses Greek debt holders were forced to incur last year -- for Greece or any other eurozone nation.

"(CNN) -- The sea is a demanding environment, so people always ask, ""How are you able to sail if you can't see?"" The answer: I have an acute ""spacial"" awareness and directional ability, and I use the wind's varying pressure and patterns of waves to determine the direction I'm headed. The truth of the matter is at night on the sea, everyone is blind. When the darkness takes over, it can be the most frightening or peaceful of times. A time when you can be at one with the ocean and your vessel, whether a totally blind sailor like me or blessed with 20/20 vision. When I became completely blind in 1984, I first thought sailing would no longer be possible. Then I was introduced to a program called ""Challenged America,"" which is designed to teach people with disabilities of all kinds how to sail. I realized it was something I had to be a part of, and I welcomed one of my truest passions back into my life. Having logged thousands of coastal and offshore sailing miles in my youth, I've been able to add to my experience by sailing and racing on the West Coast with ""Challenged America."" This includes being the captain on two trans-Pacific races from Los Angeles to Honolulu. Ultimately, my blindness isn't my biggest challenge when I take to the open sea -- it's my type 1 diabetes. Many people don't realize the daily, if not hourly requirements that people with diabetes face. But it's a disease that when properly managed can be nothing more than something you live with, rather than something that determines how you live. I didn't discover that I had diabetes until 1968, when I awoke from a diabetic coma in a military hospital in South Vietnam. As an infantry sergeant, I went unconscious during battle, was presumed dead and placed in a body bag. Fortunately, two days later, an alert medic who was putting toe tags on dead soldiers felt my pulse still beating and immediately rushed me to the hospital. I credit diabetes with saving my life, as I later learned that many soldiers in my outfit were killed or wounded. Advances in diabetes have come a long way since then. It's technology like my waterproof Animas insulin pump and new therapies and treatment that have made my journey to this point possible. Even when you are at sea, controlling your diabetes is so much easier than just a few short years ago. Today I'm grateful for the life I've been given. I hope that how I've lived and what I've accomplished serves as inspiration for the disabled and the millions of Americans touched by type 1 diabetes every day. Through the ""Challenged America"" program, I vow to strive for more. I am proud to say that this program not only introduces adaptive sailing to people living with disabilities, but also goes far beyond and has led to opportunities for further education and employment for many individuals. I hope that in sharing my story I motivate others to find a way to make their dreams and passions a reality. My next goal: to sail around the world either solo or with a crew of sailors with disabilities.","Urban Miyares has been legally blind since the 1970s .

"(CNN) -- The United States and Germany are sending Patriot missiles and troops to the Turkish border, a warning to Syria's besieged President Bashar al-Assad. The surface-to-air interceptors would be ""dealing with threats that come out of Syria,"" said U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Threats would include Syrian strikes inside Turkey and fighting between the government and rebels that extends into Turkey. Errant Syrian artillery shells struck the Turkish border town of Akcakale and killed five Turkish civilians in October. ""We can't spend a lot of time worrying about whether that pisses off Syria,"" said Panetta after signing the order Friday. He spoke after arriving Friday at Turkey's Incirlik Air Base, a U.S. Air Force installation about 80 miles from Syria's border. Despite the prospect of U.S. missiles on Al-Assad's doorstep and a weakening regime, U.S. intelligence officials said the Syrian leader is showing no signs of giving up. Al-Assad losing control but showing no signs of leaving . The deployment includes two Patriot missile batteries, used solely for defensive purposes, and 400 U.S. troops to operate them. The United States and NATO hope to have them in place by the second week in January, and a military advance team is going in in the next several days, CNN has learned. The moves come a week after NATO foreign ministers approved the deployment of Patriots to protect Turkey against any threats from al-Assad's regime, rapidly weakening by rebel advances. Also Friday, the German parliament approved the deployment of German Patriot anti-aircraft missiles to Turkey, with 461 Bundestag deputies voting in favor of the deployment, 86 against and eight abstentions. The Netherlands have shown willingness to add Patriot batteries, NATO said Friday, to defend Turkey and ""de-escalate the crisis on NATO's southeastern border."" Patriots are constructed to take out threats from warplanes and tactical ballistic missiles to unmanned aircraft by impacting with them in midair, according to Raytheon Co., which builds them. The U.S. military used to take out Scud missiles during the Iraq war. The United States has accused Damascus of launching Scud-type artillery from the capital at rebels in the country's north. One Washington official said missiles came close to the border of Turkey, a NATO member and staunch U.S. ally. Syria's government called the accusations ""untrue rumors"" Friday, according to state news agency SANA. Damascus accused Turkey and its partners of instigating rumors to make the government look bad internationally. NATO has also said it detected what appeared to be ballistic missile launches within Syria and condemned their possible use as ""utter disregard for the lives of the Syrian people."" Turkey and NATO insist the Patriot system would be used only for defense. U.S. official: Syria uses Scud missiles against rebels . Al-Assad is 'weakening' Al-Assad's departure is the dream of his opponents. U.S. officials said the Syrian president's control is crumbling at an accelerating pace . ""It's at its lowest point yet,"" said one senior US official with direct knowledge of the latest assessments. U.S. intelligence believes the decline has accelerated in recent weeks. ""The trend is moving more rapidly than it has in the past."" The officials agreed to talk on the condition their names not be used because they were not authorized to discuss the information with the media. U.S. officials said they believe al-Assad is still controlling some of his military forces and commanders. He and his top advisers are showing less ability to maintain control than they did six to eight months ago. ""There has been a strongly downward steady progression"" in al-Assad's grip on power,"" said the senior U.S. official . The United States believes ""the wall around him is slowly coming down,"" said the senior official of the strong inner circle around the Syrian president. ""We are saying there are indicators there is weakening around Assad."" But there is no indication al-Assad is making plans to step down, the senior official and other administration officials said. Syrian regime approaching collapse, NATO chief says . A second official said al-Assad and his commanders appear to be fully aware the opposition has made significant military gains in recent weeks and that al-Assad ""is not out of it"" in his understanding of the current situation. Even with the rebel advances, loyalists in the Syrian military appear to be holding firm. Much of the anti-Assad fighting force includes military defectors. There are signs that military defections at the commander level are slowing though the U.S. analysts are not sure why, the second U.S. official said. ""There is still regime control over the military despite the fact they recognize the opposition force has improved,"" said the second U.S. official said. Syrian rebels, government battle . The Syrian civil war started in March 2011 when a government crackdown on civilian demonstrators morphed into a fight between the regime and rebels. The conflict has seized the attention of world powers for months because of the relentless brutality and the specter of the Syrian government mulling the use of chemical weapons. The war has a proxy element, with Sunni countries such as Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia backing the rebels and Shiite Iran backing the Alawite regime. The Alawite faith is an offshoot of Shiism. More than 40,000 people have died in the war. The United Nations said on Friday that many Syrians will continue to be killed and maimed after the war ends because of deadly explosives placed in residential areas across the country. The violence continued Friday, with at least 32 deaths recorded by the opposition Local Coordination Committees said.

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- A tense calm prevailed over Libya's capital Thursday after days of chaos left at least seven people dead -- including a 12-year-old boy. But it's unclear if the violence is really over -- or even who the warring groups are. ICC to Libya: Hand over Gadhafi's son . Sounds of heavy gunfire and explosions echoed across Tripoli on Wednesday night, sending waves of confusion and panic as residents weren't sure who was behind the attacks. Medical sources in Abu Saleem Hospital said two people, including a 12-year-old boy, died Wednesday from injuries sustained in the clashes, the state news agency LANA reported. The hospital also said it was treating a number of injured from the violence. LANA said it was not clear what groups were involved in Wednesday's fighting. It quoted witnesses as saying the densely populated Abu Saleem area was in a state of ""panic and fear"" as fighting closed off main roads in the area, including the one leading to the international airport. It was not clear if the fighting Wednesday was linked to deadly clashes in another southern Tripoli neighborhood a day earlier. Attack at oil protection force . On Tuesday, an armed group attacked the headquarters of the Petroleum Facilities Protection Guard (PFG) in the Salaheddin district of the capital. The Libyan government said at least five people were killed and nearly two dozen others wounded in the heavy fighting. The PFG -- a Ministry of Defense force tasked with protecting Libya's oil field -- said an armed group from the western city of Zintan surrounded at attacked its Tripoli headquarters. Opinion: Libya needs U.S. help for security . It said the group had previously been tasked with securing Al-Sharara field -- one of Libya's biggest oil fields in the south of the country. The attackers used light and heavy weapons, including anti-aircraft weapons, and injured at least six people, PFG said in a statement. The armed group fled the scene after back up forces arrived, the statement said. Tripoli's Supreme Security Committee (SSC), a security body in the capital, said its forces who were protecting the PFG headquarters came under fire by the attackers. A commander of one of its brigades was killed in the attack, the SSC said in a statement. The security body also said the armed group fled to a nearby former military base and positioned snipers on the rooftops of the buildings. Clashes between members of the SSC and the armed group ensued. Read more: Protesters, militia members clash in Benghazi; 28 die . Dozens of casualties were reported by the SSC. It said one of its members was killed in addition to three Ministry of Defense personnel in the clashes. The SSC said Tuesday's violence was related to Wednesday's clashes, but it was unclear exactly how. A sign of the times . While inter-militia clashes in the Libyan capital became less frequent over the past year, the latest fighting underscores one of the biggest challenges facing Libya. Since the 2011 fall of Moammar Gadhafi's regime, the country has been awash in weapons and militias. Some of these militias have been legitimatized by the Libyan government, while others have not. As militias refuse to disarm or work under the authority of the state, Libya is still struggling to build its security forces -- something the prime minister said would take years. The government heavily relies on militias that are mostly divided along regional lines to try to secure the country. More attacks elsewhere . In addition to Tripoli's violence, three car bombs exploded Wednesday evening across the southern city of Sabha, killing at least two people and injuring 17 others, LANA reported. One of the car bombs exploded on a commercial street, a second blew up near a security directorate and the third went off outside a hotel in the center of town, the agency said. CNN's Holly Yan contributed to this report.","At least seven people are killed during clashes in Tripoli this week .

"(CNN) -- Italian climber Riccardo Ricco has become the third cyclist to be kicked out of this year's Tour de France after testing positive for the blood-booster EPO, but by far the most high profile. Riccardo Ricco is the highest-profile of the three riders so far ejected from this year's Tour de France. Ricco, who had already won two stages in the race and was lying in ninth position overall, was taken off the Saunier Duval team bus by police on Thursday and booed by spectators, Associated Press reported. Saunier Duval subsequently pulled all of its riders, including eighth-placed Juan Jose Cobo and stage 10 winner Leonardo Piepoli, out of the race as they sought to investigate the situation. ""It's a team decision not to start the race,"" sporting director Matxin Fernandez told AP. ""He's our leader, we can't act as if nothing happened. We suspend the activities of the team until we know what happened."" The 24-year-old Ricco, considered one of the world's top climbers, tested positive for EPO after the fourth stage, a time trial in the western town of Cholet. He had come under suspicion about what he says is his naturally high hematocrit level -- the volume of red blood cells in his system. High hematocrit levels can suggest use of EPO, but do not confirm it. ""May the cheaters get caught. May they go away,"" said Tour president Christian Prudhomme. ""I said to the riders before the race, behind closed doors, that you have the key (to stop doping in cycling) ... Some didn't get the message."" Ahead of Thursday's 12th stage, Ricco was two minutes and 29 seconds behind overall leader Cadel Evans of Australia -- but was expected to close the gap when the race reaches the Alps next week. He had won the sixth and ninth stages and was top of the King of the Mountains and Young Rider categories to confirm his status as one of the sport's rising stars. Ricco came into the French event in fine form, having finished second overall at his home Giro d'Italia, winning two stages in the process. He follows Spanish duo Moises Duenas Nevado and Manuel Beltran in being kicked out of the race following positive drug tests. Duenas Nevado, of the Barloworld team, was also busted for using EPO on Wednesday, while veteran Liquigas rider Beltran was ejected last Friday after testing positive for the same substance. The controversies have provided even more embarrassment for race organizers, already reeling after Floyd Landis was stripped of his 2006 title for steroid use and Michael Rasmussen was kicked off while leading last year's race for lying to his team to avoid a random drug test.

"Boca Raton, Florida (CNN) -- The third and final presidential debate proved to be a substantive, if not sharp, discussion on the major issues facing the nation as both candidates tried in earnest to persuade the small sliver of undecideds to vote for them. While foreign policy was the overarching theme, it was no surprise that the domestic economy shared center stage as President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney each sought to score points on the No. 1 issue of this election. In two weeks, the long and bitter campaign will come to a close -- barring an election controversy [shudder the thought] -- and Monday night's debate will help frame the discussion in the closing days. Reflecting on the 90-minute matchup in Florida, here are five takeaways: . 1. Heated, but measured disagreements . The level of animosity between the two candidates was apparent but unlike last week, it was capped due in a large part to the debate format and setting. It is much more difficult to bring a level of personal anger to a boiling point while seated at a table. Sitting on high chairs with the ability to walk freely on the stage seems to help fuel rage, while sitting together at a table appears to have a cooling affect. Obama wins final debate, but does it matter? That's not to say there were not prickly exchanges -- OK, very prickly exchanges -- or talking over one another during points of contention, but it rarely rose to the level where it appeared the boxing gloves were going to come out. From Libya to Iran and Syria to China -- and the economy -- the candidates opined about challenges facing the nation in this last chance to reach an audience of tens of millions of voters. A colleague turned to me several times unprompted during the 90-minute exchange and said, ""I wish all of the debates were like this one."" 2. It's the economy, stupid . It was a debate about foreign policy, an important subject that plays second fiddle to the No. 1 issue on voter's minds this election: the economy, the economy and the economy -- OK, in addition to a handful of other domestic issues such as health care, taxes, education, and Social Security. Funniest tweets from the final debate . There was substantive discussion and disagreement on foreign policy during the face-off, but as we noted earlier, the economy received a fair amount of air time. Romney tried to convince voters the economy was a national security issue that has weakened America's standing in the world. And when presented the opportunity, the Republican presidential nominee seized it to again present his five-point plan to revive the sluggish economy that includes creating training programs for workers to helping small businesses grow and thus create more jobs. In turn, Obama highlighted his administration's efforts at improving education, while criticizing Romney's record on education and small business as governor of Massachusetts. Hardly topics that can be classified as foreign policy, yet issues that are paramount to voters. Analysis: No knockout, but more punches . 3. Commander-in-chief card . At strategic points throughout the night, Obama played the commander-in-chief card as a way to show that he has had to make the difficult decisions that only a president faces. At the top of the debate: ""Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe. And that's what we've done over the last four years."" During a contentious exchange on foreign policy: ""Here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief."" And the closer: ""As commander in chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm. But after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation-building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom."" Advantage Obama, he effectively played the card Romney couldn't: being commander in chief. But Romney also saw some benefit in not being president. He didn't have to defend a record and was able to talk about his vision for the country without having to answer for any shortcomings. Presidential debate's global reaction: Disappointment . 4. America's role in the world . My favorite topic of the night: It is a question that allows a candidate to go big in his vision for the future. Of course, each candidate took the opportunity to use it to talk in political terms, but not before offering these words of hope -- Romney: ""I absolutely believe that America has a responsibility and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that make the world more peaceful."" Obama: ""America remains the one indispensable nation. And the world needs a strong America."" Enough said. It was a presidential question, appropriate for the final presidential debate. Read a transcript of the debate . 5. Closing arguments . It is now a race to November 6 as both candidates crisscross the country in search of votes from the small group of battleground states that will decide this election. Obama wakes up in Florida on Tuesday and holds a rally before heading to Ohio for a campaign event with Vice President Joe Biden. Romney travels out West to join vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan for a campaign event in Las Vegas before flying to Colorado for an evening rally. In the moments following the debate, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina was very clear about the political strategy in these final two weeks: ""Persuading undecideds and turning out your vote."" By no means did Messina lift back the curtain and provide insight that we did not already know, but it goes to show you that politics is a very basic game -- the person with the most votes wins. Watch the debate again on CNN.com . As for where exactly Obama will spend most of his time in these closing days, Messina would not commit to particular states but emphasized, ""We are going to be very flexible where we go.""

"(CNN) -- Daniel Hernandez Jr. isn't your typical 23-year-old. On January 8, 2011, Jared Lee Loughner opened fire at a ""Congress on Your Corner"" event in Tucson, Arizona, featuring U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Since he had some medical training, Hernandez ran toward the gunfire to tend to victims, realized Giffords was shot on the left side of her head and used his bare hands to keep her from losing more blood. Six people died and 13 people were injured, including Giffords, who is still recuperating. That was Hernandez's first week interning for Giffords. He was only 20. He's been credited with saving Giffords' life and recognized as a hero, although he rejects the title. Since the tragedy, Hernandez's life hasn't been the same: It's involved interviews, meeting the president and first lady, and national fame. After graduating from the University of Arizona, he was elected to serve on a school board in Tucson but also travels the country as an inspirational speaker. Now, in a heartfelt memoir, ""They Call Me a Hero: A Memoir of My Youth,"" the Tucson native speaks in detail of the shooting, the experiences that have helped shaped him and why he doesn't want to be called a hero. Hernandez spoke with CNN about the book and growing up gay and Hispanic in Arizona. An edited transcript of the conversation is below. Gabby and Mark: The new 'Bradys' of gun control . CNN: It's clear in the book that you aren't comfortable with the word ""hero"" or the attention, so what challenges did you come across when writing this book? Daniel Hernandez Jr.: You know, it's not easy writing a memoir when you don't like talking about yourself. (laughs) That was something I had to overcome quickly. I was very fortunate in working with young-adult writer Susan Goldman Rubin. But, when we were writing, she kept having to remind me, ""I need you to tell me what it was like and how you felt,"" because I was very matter-of-fact and straightforward. Having to talk about my emotions and having to remember very sad and tragic memories was very tough for me. Giving up my privacy to achieve writing what I thought was a good book was difficult, but I didn't want to write something and hold back, because that would've defeated the purpose of writing a memoir. CNN: What inspired you to write this memoir? Hernandez: I was first approached to do a memoir right after the shooting, but the pitch seemed opportunistic and contrived and not something I was willing to do, especially considering six people were just killed and 13 were injured. I didn't want it to seem like I was taking advantage of something so horrific. If it were up to me, I would not be writing a memoir at the age of 21. But the idea of public service and getting young people involved came up, and that interested me, because there aren't too many young gay Latino authors who are writing about their experiences. So that's why I really chose to work on this project. CNN: Whom did you write book for? Hernandez: I've traveled around the country and have met LGBT or Latino young people who think they aren't being taken seriously, who are doing amazing work on social issues, who would say to me, ""We're so excited that you're here. We never see people like us working to make this world a better place."" I was writing to them. Loughner sentenced to life for Arizona shootings . CNN: After the shooting, you were hesitant to do any interviews, but then a friend who helped you with the press said it was important ""to show that a Hispanic man saved the day in a state that has been discriminatory toward Hispanics."" Was this what made you change your mind? Hernandez: Someone who is in my shoes who probably should've never had the opportunity to intern for the congresswoman, because Latinos aren't expected to do well academically. Kelly made me realize that something positive had to come out of this horrific situation, especially someone who typically wouldn't be in this position. I still continue to do interviews because I think it's important for people to see ""this is the face of Arizona, this is the face of America,"" and it's a different face from the one you are used to, but it's one that's in every community around this country. CNN: Is it difficult to be Hispanic and gay in Arizona? Hernandez: It depends on where you are, sadly. For example, I do a lot of driving, and when I'm in rural Arizona, I'll get pulled over a lot but not because I'm speeding but because of what I look like. He'll say, ""You were reported as being suspicious,"" and I'll hand over I.D., but then his whole demeanor will change, and he'll say, ""Aren't you the guy who helped Gabby?"" It's really striking that I went from being a ""suspicious driver"" to being the ""hero"" who helped Gabby. It's one of the reasons that I'm so vocal about staying in Arizona and doing what I can do here. I love Arizona. But if Latinos aren't here to fix these problems, then it's never going to be done. It'll only get worse. The demographics will change soon; the Latino population will soon be the majority, but we need institutions to facilitate that. I want to show that we're here and we care just as much as you do about making Arizona a better place to live for everyone. CNN: Do you have a five-year plan? Hernandez: I'll probably go back to grad school at some point, learn as much as I can from people all over the country. Whether it's volunteering at the school board or writing a book, I'm just making the best out of this horrific situation. Hopefully inspiring some folks to get interested in their community that otherwise weren't involved. Unfortunately, there is no grandiose five-year plan. There used to be, but things have changed because of what happened on January 8. I never thought that I'd be in the position that I'm in now.

"(CNN) -- Every Australian child should learn Mandarin, Hindi or other regional language as the nation's future is tied to the rise of the ""Asian Century,"" Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in a policy speech on Sunday. ""Whatever else this century brings, it will bring Asia's return to global leadership, Asia's rise. This is not only unstoppable, it is gathering pace,"" Gillard said in a long-awaited policy white paper entitled, ""Australia in The Asian Century."" The policy outlines 25 objectives Australia must achieve by 2025 to take advantage of Asia's rise to boost the wealth of Australians. Chief among the goals are that every child learn an Asian language, in particular Mandarin, Japanese, Indonesian or Hindi, and that they leave school having studied Asian culture. Opinion: The speech every woman should hear . ''Children in kindergarten now will graduate from high school with a sound working knowledge of Asia,'' Gillard said at the Lowy Institute in Sydney where she unveiled the white paper. The Prime Minister said ""a hundred years ago we spoke of the working man's paradise. Today we speak of the high school, high-wage road. We have always wanted to do it our way. ""We long saw Asia as a threat to all this - racially, militarily, and economically. Indeed this was precisely the moral paradox of the working man's paradise. A hundred years ago, high wages meant white man's wages. No more,"" she said. While the Australian economy has ridden high on the back of the mining boom and commodity sales to Asia, Gillard said the next economic wave will be pushed by the burgeoning Asian middle classes. Broadening technology in agriculture and raising the global rankings of Australia's schools and universities will help meet increased regional demand from newly wealthy Asian neighbors, Gillard said. ""More middle class people than there are anywhere else on earth will want access to clean food, high quality food, high quality wine the same way we do. This is a huge opportunity for regional Australia. And we want people out there ready,"" she told a media conference after her speech. The Gillard government will create a new ministry of Asian Century Policy to drive the reforms across education, infrastructure, tax and regulatory reform. Australia's prime minister comes out swinging in sexism row . If the objectives are met, Gillard predicts about one-third of the Australian economy will be tied to Asia, up from 25% in 2011, and the average national income will increase to A$73,000 (US$75,700) per person, up from the current A$62,000. The white paper notes that Australia will seek to stay competitive by abandoning its historic fear of low Asian wages and by becoming a ""higher skill, higher wage economy with a fair, multicultural and cohesive society and a growing population."" Kathe Kirby, the executive director of Asia Education Foundation at the University of Melbourne, says the paper sets out a deep vision for Australia's future ""which starts with our young people at school."" ""It encompasses reform in the education sector, schools, universities, vocational education. It's a much broader and deeper plan than we've seen to date. This is not a government report. It's government policy,"" she told Sky News. Gillard also noted the broader geopolitical ambitions for Australia between military ally Washington and economic ally Beijing. In tacit acknowledgment of the criticism of her government's deference to the United States in Asia, she said ""We have an ally in Washington -- respect in Beijing -- and more, an open door in Jakarta and Delhi, Tokyo and Seoul."" ""We in this paper are focusing on the huge economic transformations happening in our region. We are not focusing on the mature economy of the United States,"" she later told a media conference. The United States is Australia's third biggest trading partner and a recent survey by the Lowy Institute shows a majority of those polled believe the U.S. to be Australia's most important security partner. Opposition party members are broadly supportive of the government's ambitions for deeper economic and social engagement with Asia, but skeptical it can be delivered. ""It is full of laudable goals but not very many specific initiatives and certainly no commitment of money to any of them,"" said opposition leader Tony Abbott. ""To some extent this government is scrambling to overcome some serious failures in its relationship with Asia,"" he said, ""most notably the early ban on uranium sales to India, only just reversed, and the catastrophic ban on live cattle sales to Indonesia, which still has ramifications."" Polls show the Prime Minister's goals for greater Asian engagement are broadly accepted by Australians. But there are caveats. According to a Lowy Institute poll, a majority felt Australia did not fall into recession in the global financial crisis because of Asian demand for Australian resources. However some 56% thought there was too much investment from China and 63% were strongly opposed to allowing foreign companies to buy Australian farmland to grow crops or farm livestock.","Australia launches a new policy aimed at tying its economic future to a rising Asia .

"(CNN) -- At least one person has died and 14 are injured after part of the roof collapsed at a soccer stadium in the Netherlands Thursday, local officials have said. Sniffer dogs are being used to search for any others who may be trapped in the wreckage, Moniek Eberhard in the mayor's office for the town of Enschede told CNN. Those injured are thought to be construction workers. It is not known how many people were working in the area when the collapse occurred, at midday local time. Two people were seriously injured and have been taken to hospital, while three were treated at the scene, Eberhard said. The club has grown over recent seasons, and was working to expand the seating at its stadium. Building work was being carried out on the roof above the stands at the FC Twente soccer club's De Grolsch Veste stadium. Speaking at a televised news conference, the club's general affairs manager, Jan van Halst, urged fans not to come to the stadium to see the damage as it might hinder the work of emergency responders. The club, founded in 1965, finished second in the top Dutch league, the Eredivisie, last season, having won it the year before. FC Twente also made its first appearance in the Champions League, a major European tournament, last season. Enschede is to the east of the Netherlands, near the border with Germany. CNN's Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.","NEW: Soccer club official urges fans to stay away from the scene as rescue efforts continue .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Jyoti is the Hindi word for light. It's something Pranav Mehta has never had to live without. And he is lucky. Near where he lives in Gujarat, one of the most prosperous states in India, thousands of rural villages lack electricity or struggle with an intermittent supply at best. Massive solar satellites would beam power back to ground-based receivers on Earth. ""We need to empower these villages, and for empowerment, energy is a must,"" Mehta said. ""Rural India is suffering a lot because of a lack of energy."" By 2030, India's Planning Commission estimates that the country will have to generate at least 700,000 megawatts of additional power to meet the demands of its expanding economy and growing population. Much of that electricity will come from coal-fired power plants, like the $4 billion so-called ultra mega complex scheduled to be built south of Tunda Wand, a tiny village near the Gulf of Kutch, an inlet of the Arabian Sea on India's west coast. Dozens of other such projects are already or soon will be under way. Yet Mehta has another solution for India's chronic electricity shortage, one that does not involve power plants on the ground but instead massive sun-gathering satellites in geosynchronous orbits 22,000 miles in the sky. The satellites would electromagnetically beam gigawatts of solar energy back to ground-based receivers, where it would then be converted to electricity and transferred to power grids. And because in high Earth orbit, satellites are unaffected by the earth's shadow virtually 365 days a year, the floating power plants could provide round-the-clock clean, renewable electricity. ""This will be kind of a leap frog action instead of just crawling,"" said Mehta, who is the director of India operations for Space Island Group, a California-based company working to develop solar satellites. ""It is a win-win situation."" American scientist Peter Glaser introduced the idea of space solar power in 1968. NASA and the United States Department of Energy studied the concept throughout the 1970s, concluding that although the technology was feasible, the price of putting it all together and sending it to outer space was not. ""The estimated cost of all of the infrastructure to build them in space was about $1 trillion,"" said John Mankins, a former NASA technologist and president of the Space Power Association. ""It was an unimaginable amount of money."" NASA revisited space solar power with a so-called ""Fresh Look"" study in the mid-90s but the research lost momentum when the space agency decided it did not want to further pursue the technology, Mankins told CNN. By around 2002 the project was indefinitely shelved -- or so it seemed. ""The conditions are ripe for something to happen on space solar power,"" said Charles Miller, a director of the Space Frontier Foundation, a group promoting public access to space. ""The environment is perfect for a new start."" Skyrocketing oil prices, a heightened awareness of climate change and worries about natural resource depletion have recently prompted a renewed interest in beaming extraterrestrial energy back to Earth, Miller explained. And so has a 2007 report released by the Pentagon's National Security Space Office, encouraging the U.S. government to spearhead the development of space power systems. ""A single kilometer-wide band of geosynchronous Earth orbit experiences enough solar flux in one year to nearly equal the amount of energy contained within all known recoverable conventional oil reserves on Earth today,"" the report said. The study also concluded that solar energy from satellites could provide power for global U.S. military operations and deliver energy to disaster areas and developing nations. ""The country that takes the lead on space solar power will be the energy-exporting country for the entire planet for the next few hundred years,"" Miller said. Russia, China, the European Union and India, according to the Pentagon report, are interested in the concept. And Japan, which has been pouring millions of dollars into space power studies for decades, is working toward testing a small-scale demonstration in the near future. But a number of obstacles still remain before solar satellites actually get off the ground, said Jeff Keuter, president of the George C. Marshall Institute, a Washington-based research organization. ""Like any activity in space, there are enormous engineering challenges,"" he said. One major barrier is a lack of cheap and reliable access to space, a necessity for launching hundreds of components to build what will be miles-long platforms. Developing robotic technology to piece the structures together high above Earth will also be a challenge. Then there is the issue of finding someone to foot what will be at least a billion-dollar bill. ""It will take a great deal of effort, a great deal of thought and unfortunately a great deal of money,"" Keutersaid. ""But it is certainly possible."" And Miller, of the Space Frontier Foundation, said he thinks it will be possible in the next 10 years. ""We could see the first operational power satellite in about the 2020 time frame if we act now,"" he said. ........................... Do you think beaming solar power down from space is feasible?

"(CNN) -- The latest report of an abusive outburst from petulant Maine Republican Gov. Paul LePage is just the most recent in a continuous stream of invective dating back to his 2010 campaign and the beginning of his term in 2011. LePage's language has been described in various euphemistic ways -- colorful, blunt, direct, plainspoken -- but no matter how it is sugar-coated, LePage's language is the offensive frothing of an abusive, tantrum-throwing bully. During the campaign in 2010, LePage said President Barack Obama could ""go to hell."" Now, a local newspaper reported that LePage told a fundraiser audience that Obama ""hates white people,"" and it swept through social and traditional media. Knowing LePage, nobody was surprised or doubted he said it, although he has since denied it. LePage defends himself against accusations of blatant racism by saying his son is black -- referring to a young Jamaican man who came to live with his family as a teen. That also was the excuse for the excuse LePage hid behind when he told the NAACP to ""kiss my butt"" after he was criticized for not attending his first Martin Luther King Day celebration. He vowed not to kowtow to ""special interests"" -- the NAACP -- because he is governor of ""all the people."" LePage has consistently attacked any group or position that opposes his own. He removed a mural from the Department of Labor in the dead of night because he received an anonymous letter from someone claiming the mural made him feel as though he were living in North Korea. Sadly, a federal judge in Bangor upheld his theft of the mural as government speech. LePage hired an out-of-state sign maker to produce and erect a message at the Maine border with New Hampshire that ""Maine is open for business."" In a stroke of poetic justice, the sign was stolen. He has attacked Maine Democrats, infamously and crudely saying that one state legislative leader was the first to stick it to the people of Maine without using Vaseline. He refused to meet with Democratic leadership after the party reclaimed a majority in the legislature in 2012 because the party hired a videographer to record all of his public appearances. An equal opportunity bully, however, LePage has also berated his fellow Republicans when they have dared to work with Democrats on the state budget. Local journalists have been a favorite and consistent target of LePage's mean-spirited retaliation, as well. He has said he wanted to punch a veteran reporter for Maine Public Broadcasting and has stormed out of at least one news conference and a legislative session. When journalists questioned his wife's residency in Florida, thus qualifying their daughter, whom LePage hired fresh out of college for his staff despite rumblings of nepotism, for in-state tuition at Florida State, he threw a fit and rampaged out of the interview. Complaining of biased news reporting, LePage has refused to be interviewed by the Portland Press Herald. At the national level, LePage has been the butt of the ""The Daily Show"" and ""The Colbert Report"" jokes. He is an embarrassment to the people of Maine and has made the state a laughingstock. The list of his offensive and cringe-worthy remarks goes on: Calling state workers ""corrupt,"" comparing the IRS to the Gestapo, saying the worst case of the use of a controversial chemical additive will be that it might give women ""little beards."" However painful it is to see how much LePage has ruined the public's opinion of Maine, I am resigned to the probability that his pattern of bullying and blustering followed by defensive claims of populism is likely to end only when he leaves office. A plea for political civility similar to the one that followed the assassination attempt against former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords may be the only response to LePage that has a chance, although he only insults fellow Maine Republicans who try to cajole him into civility. His abusive bullying is comparable to former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's literal use of gun sights on a graphic to mark the Democrats she wanted targeted. And if there was any politician who matched LePage for abusive language and combativeness, it's the late Louisiana Gov. Huey Long. The best news I've heard about LePage of late is that he might run for Congress rather than a second term as governor. Running at the mouth in the media spotlight of the nation's capital could spell the political doom he deserves, and leave Maine in peace to rebuild its tarnished image as a state with a tradition of independent yet high-minded and civil-tongued politicians.","Paul Grosswiler: Maine Gov.

"Washington (CNN) -- Top congressional Democrats renewed their push Wednesday for legislation that would remove all oil spill liability caps -- a move some Republicans warn would lead to stronger monopolies in the energy sector while increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil sources. Among other things, Democrats are targeting the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, which could limit BP's liability for economic damages incurred by the Gulf disaster to $75 million.  Critics note that the amount is a small fraction of the cost a major oil spill like the Gulf disaster will inflict on communities.  BP has said it will waive the cap on damages and pay ""all legitimate claims"" as a result of the Gulf spill, the largest in U.S. history. Democratic leaders on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, however, said during a hearing Wednesday that the caps need to be permanently lifted under the law.  The issue was also broached during a meeting of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a separate hearing on the hotly disputed matter on Tuesday. ""If you or I ... got into an accident that we caused, (we'd be) responsible for all the damages,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, the Environment and Public Works Committee's chairwoman.  There would be ""no caps in that case, and there should be no caps in this case."" The proposal now under consideration originally would have raised the cap to $10 billion.  Democrats later changed it -- with the backing of the White House -- to eliminate the cap completely. ""The person who makes the mistake ought to be responsible,"" said Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, one of the bill's sponsors.  ""And if the penalty is that they're going to be responsible and have to pay, they're sure going to be a lot more careful about what they're doing."" But Sen. Kit Bond, R-Missouri, argued that the proposal would give the largest energy companies a virtual monopoly by making oil drilling in places like the Gulf of Mexico prohibitively expensive. It will ""kill all competition that big oil faces"" and turn the Gulf ""into big oil's own private pond,"" he asserted.  ""We cannot close down the Gulf ... without putting ourselves at hostage even further to the Venezuelans, the Chinese, Russia (and other oil producers) that don't have to follow"" the same standards. If we get this wrong, Oklahoma GOP Sen. James Inhofe said, it ""could set back this nation's energy future for decades.""  We need to approach the issue ""logically and not emotionally."" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, dismissed GOP concerns about the potential creation of a new energy monopoly.  This isn't about mom-and-pop drillers, he said.  ""This is about safe versus unsafe companies."" ""If you're an unsafe company that's also small, we should (all) be concerned,"" he said.  ""Small safe companies should be able to continue operating in the Gulf without fear."" Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, suggested that Congress should adopt for oil companies the liability standard currently used by the nuclear industry, under which every company is held responsible for any accident. ""All of the operators ... are interested"" in what's happening at other reactors, he said.  Under that standard, ""you wouldn't have the prospect of Chevron or Exxon sitting on the sidelines watching BP"" trying to deal with the current spill. Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, in turn pushed an alternative measure specifically holding BP liable for the current Gulf disaster without permanently repealing liability caps. Menendez slammed Vitter's plan, calling it ""bad public policy and also (probably) illegal."" The $75 million cap is one of several potential limitations on oil companies' liability now being targeted by Democrats.  Several senators have also blasted a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that cut the amount of punitive damages a jury awarded to victims of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill by $2 billion. They've also criticized an 1851 law limiting shipowners' post-accident liability to the value of a sunken vessel.  Rig owner Transocean used the law in the days immediately following the April 20 Gulf explosion to attempt to limit its liability to $26 million.","Top Democrats say removal of oil spill liability cap needs to be permanent .

"(CNN) -- The year is 1969 and Britain is at the peak of its counter-culture revolution -- a time of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. The Beatles are putting together their final album while a relatively unknown musician, David Bowie is making waves with his track ""Space Oddity."" Meanwhile, in Liverpool, a 15-year-old schoolgirl is headed for trouble. Though academically gifted, Jude Kelly is bored at school and overcome with a mix of teenage angst and a vivid imagination. She's beginning to hang around with a rough crowd and soon finds herself in trouble with the law. But one person has taken notice of her downward spiral -- her high school principal. ""The headmaster said to me, 'I don't care if you do maths or biology or whatever, it doesn't matter ... but make sure that you use your imagination for creative good rather than self-destruction',"" recalls Kelly. Fast forward several decades and she's done just that. Today Kelly, 59, is the artistic director of Britain's beloved cultural institution -- London's Southbank Centre. Looking back, it's clear how defining that very moment was. ""As soon as he said it, I knew he was right -- I feel very strongly that young people deserve help, time, space and permission to be expressive."" His advice spurred Kelly to form a drama club with her fellow classmates including Clive Barker, the now bestselling British horror author, and comedian Les Dennis. After high school, her passion for the arts continued to flourish. Studying Drama at Birmingham University, she decided to become a director. It was a bold career choice for women in the 1970s -- but by age 22, she defied naysayers by becoming one of the youngest artistic directors in the country. ""If you have a sense that you want to make the world change, then you've got to go and do it. You can't ask somebody else to change the world for you."" It's hard not to be intimidated by Kelly before meeting her. Her illustrious career has seen her open and run theater houses across the country, such as the West Yorkshire Playhouse and Battersea Arts Centre. Directing over 100 productions including the Royal Shakespeare Company, the National Theatre, Chichester Festival Theatre, the English National Opera, the ChÃ¢talet in Paris while in the West End, she has worked with some of industry's finest thespians, including Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Patrick Stewart. But as Kelly enters her glass office, I'm immediately struck by how her theatrical aura and energetic spirit fills the room. Wearing a sleek black dress over her petite frame, she crosses her legs showing off a simple pair of sneakers -- an unlikely combination that works. Wasting no time, she delves into her passion for combining education with the arts. ""I believe wholeheartedly that in terms of human progress, arts education and arts and cultural expression is a key part of how great societies develop,"" says Kelly. As she leans forward, she talks of creativity being the key to helping troubled youth -- a path she can relate to. ""My experience [is] that if I hadn't found that sense of purpose and identification, and had a way of doing it, that my life could have turned out differently."" ""To lose any generation because they haven't been able to fulfill their potential is a tragedy,"" she adds. So far, during her tenure as head of Southbank Centre and a once wayward teen herself -- she has made it her mission to provide a space for young people to express themselves. To that end, Britain's largest arts center is currently undergoing a massive refurbishment to develop a festival wing which will include a youth village, a children's future center, arts education studios and a backstage space for emerging DJs, dancers, filmmakers and photographers to cultivate their skills. Additionally, the cultural hub offers a schools-in-residence program giving educational institutions the opportunity to move all of their classes to the Southbank location and immerse the students with the subjects while on the premises. ""We are also working with all kinds of urban artists -- hip-hop artists, graffiti artists, parkour, BMX riders -- sort of merging of culture, leisure and art so that young people have a route in [to the arts] via the thing that excites them."" But Kelly's commitment to ensuring the art world is inclusive goes one step further. Not content with the investment made in shaping female minds of the future, in 2011 Kelly established the Women of the World (WOW) Festival. Held each March in honor of International Women's Day, it's an event she calls ""a celebration of everything women and girls can do, have done and could do."" The week-long festival provides an opportunity for women to come together, share success stories and network. It has proven so popular that the WOW festival has spread to a number of cities across the globe, most recently in Baltimore and Sydney. ""Women very often have been amazing pioneers in a sense of saying here's something that is clearly missing on the landscape and it needs somebody to roll their sleeves up and make it happen,"" says Kelly. ""I'm not saying it's only women that pioneer in the arts, but I think that people would be shocked to understand just how many women have put in the scaffolding upon which current arts policy has been created."" From Ethel Smyth, a British conductor and member of the suffrage movement, to Lilian Baylis, a theatrical producer who opened London's Old Vic Theater, Kelly admits, as an artistic director, she has often looked to female role models for inspiration. These days Kelly herself has become somewhat of a pioneer of the arts. She sat on the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad Board, represents Britain on cultural affairs within UNESCO and is the founder and chair of Metal, an artistic laboratory. In 1997 she received the honor of Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her services to British arts and culture. And in February, Kelly was named one of the 100 most powerful women in Britain by BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour. While she doesn't recognize her work as revolutionary, she does believe she has been part of a larger shift in the UK's cultural landscape. ""I think I have been part of a transformative movement, a pioneering movement of people saying that we must never underestimate what human beings are capable of. ""We have got a right, a duty to make more space, more time, more opportunity for the many and not the few.""","Jude Kelly is the artistic director of the London's Southbank Centre .

"(CNN) -- A Georgia judge signed off Friday on the prosecution's request to drop all murder charges against Andrea Sneiderman, whom authorities have said conspired with her boss to have her husband killed. Prosecutors said the murder charges against Sneiderman were ""unjust and unethical"" because they weren't positive they could prove them. Before the decision, Sneiderman was facing malice murder, felony murder and aggravated assault charges related to the death of her husband, Rusty. All three were dismissed. Prosecutors will continue to pursue four counts of perjury, seven counts of making false statements to law enforcement officials and one count of hindering the apprehension of a criminal. Jury selection begins Monday. If convicted of the lesser charges, Sneiderman could still face a sizable prison sentence. One conviction of perjury carries a possible sentence of five to 10 years under Georgia law. Rusty Sneiderman, a Harvard-educated businessman, was gunned down in the parking lot of a suburban Atlanta preschool in November of 2010. He was shot four times while children played less than 30 feet away. Hemy Neuman, the gunman who also was Andrea Sneiderman's boss and alleged lover, is serving life in prison for the slaying. A jury found him guilty but mentally ill in March 2012. A judge ruled during the Friday pretrial hearing to allow statements into the trial made by Neuman to his friend, Melanie White. Prosecutors said Neuman confided in White about his alleged affair with Sneiderman, a fact they say can be bolstered by evidence. But the defense argued that Neuman was a ""certifiable lunatic"" and that his statements aren't reliable. He told psychiatric evaluators that he saw hallucinations of demons resembling Barry White and angels resembling singer Olivia Newton-John who told him that the Sneiderman children were his and he needed to kill Rusty. Judge Gregory Adams has delayed his ruling on the defense's request to let Andrea Sneiderman remove her ankle monitor and be allowed to have contact with friends who are witnesses in the case. The judge denied a defense request to delay the trial six months to a year because of the ""unrelenting"" media attention. Andrea Sneiderman entered a plea of not guilty, with her lawyers issuing a statement saying she ""categorically"" denies each and ""every one of the charges"" filed against her. InSession's Nancy Leung and CNN's Tristan Smith contributed to this report.","Malice murder, felony murder and aggravated assault charges are dropped .

"(CNN) -- For most designers showing off their latest collections at New York's Fashion Week, functionality isn't a main consideration. Models have been known to strut the catwalk in toppling hats, teetering heels and floor-length gowns with enough ruffled trim to sweep an auditorium. But not everyone's focused on runway looks 365 days a year. Hot Fashion Week commodities Prabal Gurung and Sophie Theallet are also creating uniforms for working people. This April, Sephora's beauty advisers in North America will begin wearing uniforms designed by Gurung exclusively for the cosmetics retailer. Women can choose between a black shift dress with a red slit and a black fitted pant suit. Men get sleek black separates that also incorporate slashes of red. Female staff at the Rose Bar in New York's Gramercy Park Hotel are already donning Theallet's drape dresses in spill-proof silk as part of an overall refresh of the hotel's interiors. Complete coverage: New York Fashion Week . The looks are the latest in a long line of collaborations that goes back at least as far as the 1960s, when airlines eagerly sought out high-end designers to give their flight staff a touch of class to set them apart. Halston and Pucci designed uniforms for Braniff Airlines in the 1960s and 1970s; Air France tapped Dior and Nina Ricci in the 1980s. The trend was popularized among bigger corporations in the 1970s with the help of Stan Herman, who was president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America for 16 years and is a pioneer of the ready-to-wear category. As the designer behind uniforms for FedEx, JetBlue, United Airlines, TWA and McDonald's, his creations are believed to cover more bodies than those of any other single designer. ""The most important thing is likeability,"" Herman said. ""If a corporation walks around in a uniform they don't like, they become a grumpy corporation."" A stylish outfit also helps build a brand and incorporate the staff into the design motif of their workplace. ""Art, fashion and music are all important components which shape our culture here at the Gramercy Park Hotel,"" said Damion Luaiye, the hotel's creative director. ""In building these relationships, we strive to create a place where we can work together to add a new, interesting element for our guests, whether it be new dresses for our female staff, artwork for our lobby and Rose Bar."" This marks the hotel's second uniform collaboration with a high-end designer, after a successful relationship with Narciso Rodriguez. The designer also benefits from experiencing a new kind of challenge, said Cindi Leive, editor-in-chief of Glamour. ""I think designers like the uniform challenge because it's exactly that, it's a challenge. To work within certain parameters, it's almost like a reality competition: 'Let me see how I can take these constraints and make them look fantastic.' "" CNN's Ethel Bass and Alina Cho contributed to this report.","Designers Prabal Gurung and Sophie Theallet create uniforms for the working class .

"(CNN) -- How bad is the problem of oversharing online? People are now singing about it in church. A video that's been gaining buzz online in recent days shows worshipers at an unidentified church singing a gospel-styled tune with the apparent title of ""Keep Yo Business Off of Facebook."" In the blurry two-minute clip, shot with a cell phone, churchgoers sway and clap while a man and woman sing about the pitfalls of sharing not-safe-for-church behavior. ""Sundays you act like a saint, but your Facebook posts say you ain't,"" the man sings. The video was posted online in July but has only become widely noticed in recent days after being shared, of all places, on Facebook. The origin of the video and location of the church has so far remained a mystery. Some commenters on YouTube, where posts of the video have attracted more than 200,000 views, have complained that Christian choirs should not be singing about secular topics in church. ""And this is about Jesus how? I mean it might be funny but in the midst of worship service our eyesï»¿ and attention should be affixed on Jesus, not what folks post on Facebook,"" wrote one woman. ""Handle that in mentoring or something."" ""This church is a disgrace,"" said another commenter, who called the song blasphemous. HLN: A look at 'Generation Overshare' But others have found it amusing. ""Amen!ï»¿ Apparently, God hates your duck-face selfies, drunk photos and gossiping... And so do I. LOL,"" wrote one.","Church group sings ""Keep Yo Business Off of Facebook""

"(CNN) -- Baseball. The radio. Summer. There is something about the connection between the three of them that nothing can tear apart. If baseball on the radio sounds a little different lately, there is a reason. Richard Sandomir of The New York Times reported recently on the proliferation of ""drop-in"" advertisements on radio broadcasts of ballgames around the nation. Drop-in ads are paid commercials that air not as traditional advertisements, but as part of the play-by-play. The first walk during a New York Yankees game is accompanied by ""Just walk into CityMD's six convenient locations""; the first run scored in a Texas Rangers game is described by the play-by-play man as ""the First Financial First Run."" It shouldn't be surprising that this is happening. Baseball has always been a relentlessly and unapologetically revenue-seeking enterprise. Have you ever seen photos of the outfield walls in big-league ballparks in the early to mid-20th century? Even NASCAR's marketing strategists would have been envious of the don't-waste-an-inch commercial clutter. Broadcast entities have to find a way to make back the money they spend for radio rights. According to USA Today the average salary of a Major League Baseball player this year -- the average salary -- is around $3.6 million, and everything from ticket fees to concession-stand prices is reflective of the sport's runaway inflation. So no one should be startled by the presence of the drop-in radio ads. Yes, they frequently can be an irritant to the flow of the play-by-play. But ours is a sponsor-and-advertising-driven culture overall; that's not going to go away. And baseball on the radio -- distinct even from baseball itself -- is durable and steady in ways that can't be easily spoiled. Baseball on the radio is one part of the sport that somehow, despite everything, still manages to feel good. On the radio, baseball is less literal than baseball on television. With the measured voices of the most skilled announcers accompanied by the resonant humming undertone of the crowd, the echo from down on the diamond of the crack of a bat against a fastball, and the occasional thump of a foul ball bouncing off the top of the play-by-play booth, there is a kind of romance in a radio broadcast. The sports-page and sports-website coverage of the business of baseball may, of necessity, be dismaying and ugly lately. A visit to the ballpark in person brings on the sticker-shock of those prices on everything from hot dogs to souvenirs to parking spots. Baseball on the radio, though, remains free. Unlike viewers of cable TV or subscribers to satellite radio, fans of home-team games on their hometown radio stations don't have to pay a cent to listen. The sound of it all is very much what the sound has been forever. Because the pace of the game is leisurely, local play-by-play announcers, over a 162-game season, develop a relationship with their listeners unique in sports. They have to talk a lot, even when there's not much going on down on the field, and the audience grows accustomed to, and comfortable with, their relaxed voices and their heard-but-not-seen personalities. And that's just during routine games. At certain moments, radio broadcasts of ballgames can become part of the very fabric of a town -- the authentication of how sports can help define the meaning of community. How good can it get? For a gold-standard example from the history of the sport and of the medium, listen to the KMOX radio broadcast of Stan Musial's final at-bat for the St. Louis Cardinals before his retirement. The date was September 29, 1963, at the old Busch Stadium in St. Louis. On the play-by-play was Harry Caray, in the years before he moved to Chicago to broadcast the White Sox and then the Cubs. Some older residents of St. Louis recall a television simulcast of Caray's call, but it is the KMOX radio version that is indelible in their memories: . ""Here's Musial. Listen to the crowd again."" (The roar is heard behind Caray's voice.) ""A base hit would give the Cardinals the lead."" (The noise sustains.) ""First pitch. Oh, what a cut he had, and he fouled it back. Hey, he really had a swing at that one."" (The crowd begins to clap rhythmically in unison.) ...""The stretch by Maloney. Low curve."" And then, unforgettably, from Caray: ""Take a good look, fans. ... Take a good look. This might be the last time at bat in the major leagues. Remember the stance ... and the swing."" (The rhythmic clapping in the stands grows more insistent.) ""You're not likely to see his likes again."" The procession of the game: ""Fast ball, low and away."" And soon: ""The pitch to Musial."" (Caray's voice rises to be heard above the mounting crowd noise.) ""A hot shot on the ground into right field, a base hit! ...The Cardinals lead, one to nothing, listen to the crowd! Listen to the crowd! Let's see, now! Manager Johnny Keane is talking to Gary Kolb. ""Stan is at first base. He might be waiting for this applause on the hit to die down. ... They'll tear the joint apart when he trots off the field. ... Now listen. Gary Kolb is going to replace Musial. ...There he goes! The end of a great career. A standing ovation for Musial. ..."" Could being in the stands have been any more memorable than listening to that? I remember talking once with a woman in her 80s. She was residing in an assisted-living facility; her husband had died the year before, and the end of their lifetime of long conversations in the evenings had left a void. She told me that, even though she had never been much of a baseball fan, she found herself tuning in, each evening, to the strong-signal WLW Radio out of Cincinnati. For three hours, she said, she would listen to Marty Brennaman and Joe Nuxhall broadcast the Reds' games. Their voices -- reliable, unhurried -- became her companions. A part of life she could count on. ""Take a good look, fans. ... Take a good look."" It's possible, on summer nights, to see most clearly with your eyes closed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Baseball radio play-by-play is working commercials into the announcers' descriptions .

"(CNN) -- Before the Arab Spring came the Damascus Spring. When Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father Hafez Assad in 2000, there was the promise of a modern and more democratic Syria. In his inauguration speech, al-Assad indicated he would be a very different kind of leader to his father. ""I shall try my very best to lead our country towards a future that fulfils the hopes and legitimate ambitions of our people,"" he said. And for a while that promise was kept. His official website says he has built free-trade zones, licensed more private newspapers and private universities, and fought government waste and corruption. He has also worked on social and economic reform. But while there have been some changes during his rule, many say al-Assad's promises have largely not been delivered. Human Rights Watch has called his time as president ""the wasted decade"" with a media that remains controlled by the state, a monitored and censored internet and prisons still filled with dissidents. Two former regime insiders -- now its opponents -- recalled their time with the younger al-Assad. Former vice president Abdel Halim Khaddam said Bashar was often the victim of his elder brother's cruelty. ""His brother Basil bullied him as a child. His father never gave him as much attention as Basil,"" Khaddam said. Al-Assad's uncle Rifaat, who left Syria in 1984 after being involved in a failed coup, also recalled the future president. ""He is very different than his father. Hafez was a leader, the head of the entire regime, while Bashar was never that close to being one and never fell within that framework. He is being perceived as the leader but he follows what the regime decides on his behalf."" Al-Assad himself said reform faltered because of unrest in neighboring states, Lebanon and Iraq. He told the Wall Street Journal last year: ""There are many things that we wanted to do in 2005 we are planning to do in the year 2012, seven years later."" But Abdel Halim Khaddam, vice-president under both Bashar and his father, says the younger al-Assad is both brutal and indecisive. ""Bashar's problem is that he listens to everything but denies and forgets quickly. You discuss an issue with him in the morning and another person comes along and changes his mind. ""Politically, Bashar does not have a consistent ideology; he changes his opinion according to his interests and that of the regime's."" And the regime is a family affair. Al-Assad's younger brother Maher commands an elite division of the army, and is accused of widespread human rights abuses. His cousin Rami Makhlouf is the richest man in Syria. The Assads belong to Syria's Alawite minority, who according to the president's uncle Rifaat, are driven by fears they could be overwhelmed. ""There is no doubt that the Alawites are a minority who are in fear of the outcome and they are driven by that fear factor,"" he said. Despite the brutal crackdown over the last year in Syria, in which thousands have died, al-Assad maintains he is not in charge of Syria's military. He told ABC's Barbara Walters: ""They are not my forces. They are forces for the government. I don't own them. I'm president. I don't own the country. So they are not my forces."" Wouldn't al-Assad, the commander in chief, have had to give the order for any military actions? ""No, no no,"" he said. Not by your command? ""No,"" he said, ""on no one's command. There was no command to kill or to be brutal."" Al-Assad said those members of the armed forces who ""went too far"" had been disciplined. But former vice-president Khaddam is in no doubt who does give the orders to kill: ""Bashar Al-Assad and no one else. He gives out orders to use all means of force to crush the revolution. He is surrounded by close aides and a security apparatus that advise him, but he decides."" It wasn't expected that Bashar would carry on the family's political dynasty. He didn't seem to have the personality for the job; he wasn't deeply involved in military or government matters, according to ""Inheriting Syria: Bashar's Trial by Fire,"" a biography by Flynt Leverett, who worked as an expert on Syria for the CIA in the 1990s and was the senior director for Middle East affairs at the National Security Council in the early 2000s. Because Bashar's older brother Basil was expected to succeed his father, Bashar al-Assad went to London in the 1990s and studied ophthalmology, and headed the Syrian Computer Society. ""Dr. Bashar,"" as he was widely known, liked to windsurf and play volleyball. He is believed to have started dating British-born Asma al-Akhras during this time. Bashar was called back to Syria in 1994 when Basil died in a car wreck. This turn of events made him first in line to rule Syria, and he was appointed president by Syria's rubber-stamp Parliament in 2000 after his father died. Before 2000 ended, he and Asma were married. Will Asma al-Assad take a stand or stand by her man? Shortly after the Arab Spring started in early 2011, al-Assad made apparent moves toward change in Syria. Initially, protesters wanted basic reforms, more freedoms, a multiparty political system and an end to emergency law. Some of these measures have, on paper, been implemented by al-Assad, but they were far too little and, by the time they came about, too late. After almost a year of violent protests, opposition supporters have lost any faith they ever had in al-Assad's ability to deliver reform, and simply want an end to his rule and true democratic elections. Now al-Assad and members of his close-knit regime are digging in for what could be a long war of attrition. CNN's Rima Maktabi contributed to this report.","Bashar al-Assad indicated he would be different kind of leader to his father .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The doctor convicted in Michael Jackson's death did not appeared to be pressured by AEG Live, an expert hired by the concert promoter testified Friday. Dr. Gary Green returns to the witness stand Monday, the 72nd day of testimony in the Jackson wrongful death trial in Los Angeles. Michael Jackson's mother and three children contend AEG Live is liable in the pop icon's death because it hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who is serving a prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter. The company argues that Jackson chose and controlled the doctor and that its executives had not way of knowing about the dangerous propofol infusions Murray was giving him in the privacy of Jackson's bedroom. Jackson died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic days before his comeback concert was to premiere, according to the Los Angeles County coroner. Green, who reviewed the testimony and evidence presented in the previous 16 weeks of the trial, challenged the conclusions of Dr. Gordon Matheson, a medical ethics expert hired by Jackson lawyers. ""I disagree with Dr. Matheson completely,"" said Green, who serves as the team doctor for Pepperdine University athletics. Matheson, the director of the sports medicine department at Stanford University, testified that AEG Live created a conflict of interest because the contract it negotiated with Murray to serve as Jackson's personal doctor for $150,000 a month ""was likely to lead to poor medical decisions."" Matheson, who also is team doctor for Stanford's athletic department, compared it to a football coach telling a team doctor on the sidelines in the fourth quarter of a big game that a star quarterback has to go back in the game despite a suspected concussion. Green challenged Matheson's comparison, saying the school chooses the team doctor, not the patient. Jackson chose Murray, he said. Murray, who had closed his clinics to take the job and was $1 million in debt, would be inclined not to resist the AEG Live executives' pressure to get Jackson to rehearsals despite evidence of his failing health, Matheson testified. Murray himself was conflicted because the negotiated contract was structured so that he answered to AEG, but it also could be canceled if the tour was canceled, he said. ""I think that conflict played out as Michael Jackson's health began to deteriorate."" Green testified Friday that there was no conflict because it was in Murray's interest to keep Jackson healthy so his job could continue. E-mails from the show director Kenny Ortega and production manager John ""Bugzee"" Hougdahl warned AEG executives of Jackson's deterioration during June 2009, including indications he was unable to do some of his trademark dances or remember lyrics to songs he had sung for decades. His makeup artist and a choreographer testified about Jackson's paranoia, his talking to himself and hearing voices, and his severe weight loss. Associate producer Alif Sankey testified that she ""had a very strong feeling that Michael was dying"" after a rehearsal 11 days before his death. ""I was screaming into the phone at that point,"" Sankey testified. ""I said he needs to be put in the hospital now."" The defense expert discounted the significance of an e-mail written by AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware to Ortega that the Jackson lawyers argue is evidence the promoter pressured Murray in the days before Jackson's death. Gongaware wrote: ""We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. We want to remind him what is expected of him."" Green testified Friday that since he saw no evidence the message was ever communicated to Murray, he believed ""it was not influencing."" The AEG Live expert also cited evidence that Murray resisted any interference from the promoters, telling them at one point to ""stay in their lane"" and leave Jackson's health to him. He also kept Jackson from rehearsals at one point, contrary to what the promoter wanted, Green said. AEG Live's next witness will be human resources consultant Rhoma Young, who it hired to provide expert testimony concerning the Jacksons' contention that the company negligently hired Murray.","Jackson lawyers contend AEG Live pressured Dr. Murray to get the singer to rehearsals .

"(CNN) -- The paintings and carvings have been scattered around the caves and bluff faces of the Cumberland Plateau for centuries, left behind by the ancestors of the Native American nations of the Southeast. Now a lengthy survey of the works indicates they're all part of a pattern -- a sweeping, interrelated series that illustrates how the continent's prehistoric inhabitants saw the universe and their place in it, University of Tennessee anthropologist Jan Simek said. ""What's part interesting is it spans an area literally from the Kentucky line down into northern Alabama,"" Simek said. Most of them are between 500 and 900 years old, but radiocarbon dating indicates one painting of a hunter in east-central Tennessee was laid down 6,000 years ago. That would make it the oldest representation in North America known to date, he said. See also: Ancient Mayan pyramid destroyed for road fill . ""There is this cosmology being expressed ... and one of the things we're trying to suggest is the composition has an enormous scale,"" he said. Simek and colleagues from the University of the South, the U.S. Geological Survey and Mississippi State University spent about a decade and a half documenting the rock art of the Cumberland Plateau, which slices across Tennessee between Chattanooga and Nashville. They found common themes, colors and depictions across the 94 sites, 50 of them underground. The aboveground works were drawn largely in red, a color associated with life, and tend to face to the south and west, away from the Appalachian Mountains. Why geologist tasted 2.6 billion year-old water . ""That's looking into some of the most dramatic parts of the sky, especially in the spring and summer months,"" Simek said. ""And we know their relationship was such that they paid attention to celestial phenomena, but they also believed in a universe that was layered."" Some of the images suggest an ""upper world,"" where forces of the weather and mythic representations of the sun and stars influenced human life. Those tended to be at higher elevations. Nearer the surface, ""middle world"" imagery featured people, animals and plants. New insight into ancient Americans . ""Very often some of the humans that are depicted outside of caves are doing otherworldly kinds of things,"" he said. ""Very often, their hands and feet are extended, and they have very elongated digits, as if they're reaching out of the rock or into the rock."" Many Native Americans believed boundaries between the spirit world and the natural were permeable, and things like rocks, trees and water sources -- including caves -- ""were places those boundaries could be crossed.""

Some of the images feature birds a half centimeter (1/5 of an inch) long, Simek said -- yet when you look closely, ""You can see the wing feathers on them.""

"(CNN) -- A United Airlines 787 Dreamliner was diverted due to a mechanical problem, the third such incident for Dreamliners in six days. United Flight 94 was on its way to Denver early Sunday when it was forced to fly back to the Houston airport where the flight had originated, United Airlines said. The cause: an issue with the brake indicator. The plane landed without incident and with no passenger injuries, said Boeing, which makes the Dreamliner. On Tuesday, another United Airlines Dreamliner flight made an unscheduled landing. That flight was on its way from Denver to Tokyo, when it was diverted to Seattle because of an indicated problem with its oil filter. 787 Dreamliner diverted to Seattle after oil filter problem . On Thursday a third United 787 flight was diverted to Newark's Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, United said, due to a ""low oil indication."" That Dreamliner -- which was en route from London to Houston, also landed safely. The incidents come six months after the Federal Aviation Administration and other officials grounded the Dreamliner worldwide due to troubles with its battery system. ""The 787 is a great airplane and we know it will continue to receive heightened attention when reliability events occur in service,"" Boeing spokeswoman Yvonne Leach said Sunday. Can the 'game-changer' still live up to its name? Additional Dreamliners . The 787 Dreamliner began service in the U.S. in 2012. The entire global fleet of 50 Dreamliners was grounded in January after two battery overheating incidents triggered concerns among safety officials. Among the Dreamliner's innovative new designs is a battery system that uses new, lighter lithium-ion batteries. In April, the FAA ordered all 787 operators to make specific modifications. United has been flying its fleet of six 787s since May 20. United is the sole domestic operator of the airplane, which boasts high fuel efficiency due to the light-weight carbon-composite materials used in its wings and fuselage. In an apparent show of confidence in the new airliner, United announced Tuesday it is ordering 20 additional Dreamliners, specifically the 787-10 model, which is a longer version of the plane. The plane represents a new generation of efficient wide-body, long-range airliners, helping to make it among the world's most watched aircraft. Airlines worldwide have committed to buy the plane, and hundreds of millions of dollars are riding on Dreamliner's success. Boeing's rival Airbus flew a similar airliner, its highly anticipated A350 XWB, for the first time on June 14 at its facility in Toulouse, France. The Dreamliner returns: 5 things to know .

"(CNN) -- ""Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last."" I was not yet 4 when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke those words. It has been 50 years. So much has changed. And yet... I am not a little girl. I don't live behind two sets of railroad tracks in the poor black section of town. But I'm still a mediator. I'm still an optimist. I still believe in sharing. I still love the garden. So I guess there's still a little bit of that little girl in me. Our country has changed. It seems almost superfluous to list the progress we've made when it comes to integration and equality. And yet... There are incidents -- events -- tone-deaf statements that serve as constant reminders of the inequalities and injustices we must still struggle with. These are often overlooked, or misread, or used as ""red meat"" to stir strong partisans with fear and loathing. 5 faces of the March on Washington . By ""we"" I don't mean just blacks, or Hispanics, or women -- or any group you care to name. We are in this together. Or should be. Each of us has something to contribute. And each of our groups has something to contribute. But still... E Pluribus Unum: Out of the many, one. And so I come back to the March on Washington -- the date chosen to coincide with the hundred-year anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. The struggle for true emancipation -- economic equality, political freedom, societal access, education, the right to vote, etc. -- has been long and arduous. That we have come a long way, we must acknowledge. And the sacrifice of so many who believed America could live up to its promise, we must honor. As tens of thousands of Americans gather in Washington to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the historic 1963 March on Washington, we must embrace the changes that we've made together. In 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. said the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence were ""promissory notes"" to every future American, but that ""America has given the Negro people a bad check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds.' But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. ... So we have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice."" At March on Washington: The anger, fear, love and hope . Five years later he again spoke of the ""promissory note,"" this time quoting Emma Lazarus: ""We are going to bring the tired, the poor, the huddled masses. We are going to bring those who have known long years of hurt and neglect."" King's last campaign was the ""Poor People's Campaign,"" because, as he argued in one of his sermons, ""If a man doesn't have a job or an income, he has neither life nor liberty nor the possibility for the pursuit of happiness."" I think it's important to remember that civil rights and economic rights are mutually dependent. I mean this in two ways. First, as King expressed it: . ""Oh America, how often have you taken necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes. ... God never intended for one group of people to live in superfluous inordinate wealth, while others live in abject deadening poverty."" I want to make sure we understand that not only are race and economics intertwined, but also that economics changes the political equation. For instance, the 1963 March on Washington called for ""a massive federal public works program to provide jobs for all the unemployed"" and spoke of the ""twin evils of discrimination and economic deprivation."" The only class MLK ever taught . We see this truth played out in the politics of today -- whether the discrimination is against blacks, Hispanics, women, the poor, elderly, LGBT or any other group. We find that political emancipation both requires and demands economic emancipation. And economic emancipation, in turn, depends more and more on educational emancipation. As Lee Sigelman and Susan Welch report in their book, ""Black Americans' Views of Racial Inequality: The Dream Deferred,"" the ""gradual growth of the black middle class, the increase in the number of elected black officials at all levels of government, the growing presence of African-Americans in prominent positions in business and the arts, and the rise in the political and economic prominence of members of other ethnic groups along with women of various races and ethnicities, all have presumably propelled and reinforced the growth of more favorable attitudes toward African-Americans."" A King daughter's long journey . In other words, if we look back on the last 50 years, we have to not just admit, but agree that we have moved closer to the realization of the true American dream, as articulated by King: ""I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Tuesday is the 50th anniversary of the historic 1963 March on Washington .

"(CNN) -- Fifty years ago this week, the civil rights movement rocked the nation's capital. Bayard Rustin, Martin Luther King, Roy Wilkins and the other major civil rights leaders led thousands of activists in a march on Washington. Their goal was to build pressure on Congress to move forward with the civil rights bill that President Kennedy had proposed. The march remains one of the most powerful examples of how social movements can affect political leaders and help break through the gridlock that often seizes Washington. Although politicians and pundits constantly express nostalgia that things were easier in the past, the fact is that Congress has always been a notoriously difficult institution. Where the problem today is that the parties are so polarized there is little room for agreement, in the early 1960s, the parties were so internally divided that bipartisan coalitions were able to stop legislative deals. Brazile: We're closer to the American dream . During the 1950s and early 1960s, an era when scholars and reporters complained about how little was accomplished on Capitol Hill, the main source of obstruction came from Southern Democrats and their conservative Republican allies. The ""do-nothing Congress"" was a familiar complaint then as it is now. Southerners used their power as committee chairmen as well as the threat of the filibuster in the Senate to prevent action on civil rights and to ensure that any bill that did make it through — as occurred in 1957 and 1960 — was so watered down that it was ineffective. Our lessons with Martin Luther King . Much to the chagrin of civil rights leaders, President Kennedy had shied away from proposing civil rights legislation during most of his term. He feared that sending a bill to Congress would hurt him in the 1964 election and cause Southerners to increase their opposition to his other domestic initiatives, like Medicare (in fact, Southerners ended up opposing civil rights and everything else, so Kennedy's strategy did not work). Civil rights activists responded by continually applying pressure on the White House to take action. Activists staged protests throughout the South, hoping that civil disobedience — and the violent responses of Southern authorities — would stimulate national outrage about racial conditions in Dixie. They were right. These efforts culminated in June 1963, when the police tactics of Sheriff Bull Connor and the Birmingham, Alabama, police force against African-Americans, including the use of fire hoses and police dogs against children, were so abhorrent that Kennedy could no longer hold back on proposing a bill. Indeed, liberal Republicans and Democrats were ready to move forward without the president. 50 years after King, hidden racism lives on . After Kennedy had finally sent a bill to the House, civil rights leaders rightfully didn't have faith that Congress would move forward with it, or that Kennedy would work hard to make sure the bill did not die. They had seen a Congress that was so gridlocked on this and other issues, they didn't have much reason to believe that this time things would be different. So ordinary citizens took it on themselves. At the end of August, they conducted the massive March on Washington aimed at the nation but also at the legislators, who were impressed by the force of the protest. John Lewis, then one of the leaders of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, told those assembled on the National Mall: ""By and large, American politics is dominated by politicians who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic and social exploitation. . .. Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march on Washington?"" Opinion: The anger, the fear, the love and the hope . The march was considered to be a stunning success, an act of civil protest that won public support for the cause and convinced a growing number of legislators to support the bill. Michigan Democrat Phil Hart, a liberal who originally did not think the march would do much, admitted that the ""magnificent, moving, and edifying"" protest had been effective. The overall message was clear, one that leaders would continue to communicate over the next few months. If Congress tried to stifle the civil rights bill there would be more protests like this that embarrassed the nation in the eyes of the world, as well as protests in the states and districts of key legislators who were obstructing racial justice. The civil rights bill would take some time to pass. The movement continued to put pressure on Congress, threatening even bigger marches and protests in their states if they did not act. The protests would continue throughout these months. In summer 1964, civil rights proponents finally brought the civil rights filibuster to an end and Congress passed legislation that ended desegregation in the South. LZ Granderson: The man history erased . To be sure, other factors would play an important role in the success of the civil rights bill in the coming months. JFK's assassination had created more political pressure on Congress to finish work on the bills that he had sent them. LBJ's legislative skills helped the White House avoid the pitfalls of the legislative process. But without the massive citizen mobilization that culminated with the March on Washington, the civil rights bill would never have succeeded. The March on Washington, combined with the other grass-roots protests, was a shining example of how gridlock can be brought to an end and how average citizens can shake the political system when key actors are blocking progress on key issues of the day. Today we should take a closer look at this march. In an age when certain members of Congress are unwilling to resolve so many issues — from gun control to immigration — it is worth remembering that in the past, citizens have been able to make a huge difference. Legislators are, after all, creatures of elections. If mass movements can make demands on the leadership and demonstrate the urgency of action, they might be the push legislators need toward the legislation that seems so elusive in 2013.

"Washington (CNN) -- Heralding the long fight toward racial equality that many say hasn't ended, President Barack Obama commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech Wednesday on the same steps the civil rights leader spoke from half a century ago. ""His words belong to the ages, possessing a power and prophecy unmatched in our time,"" Obama told a diverse crowd that gathered under gray skies and intermittent drizzle to attend the hours-long ceremony. King, Obama said, ""gave mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions,"" hailing leaders who braved intimidation and violence in their fight for equal rights. On that August day in 1963, when King and his fellow marchers attended what he labeled ""the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation,"" few in that crowd could have imagined that half a century later, an African-American president of the United States would mark the occasion with a speech in the same location. And during his remarks from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Obama cast his own election to the Oval Office as a consequence of persistence and courage from leaders such as King. 9 things about MLK's speech and March on Washington . ""Because they kept marching, America changed,"" Obama said. ""Because they marched, city councils changed and state legislatures changed and Congress changed and, yes, eventually, the White House changed."" While other, negative changes have forestalled the push toward racial harmony, Obama stressed Wednesday that the work of civil rights leaders had permanently changed the discourse between races in America. ""To dismiss the magnitude of this process, to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed, that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years,"" Obama said. Read Obama's full remarks . Adopting words from another of King's speeches, Obama declared that ""the arc of the moral universe may bend toward justice, but it doesn't bend on its own."" Leaders speaking at Wednesday's anniversary event, including Obama, stressed that income disparity, high unemployment and a shrinking middle class have slashed hopes for attaining equality for millions of Americans, though the president said those facts couldn't erase the forward march of the civil rights movement. ""To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency,"" he said, adding, ""We will suffer the occasional setback, but we will win these fights. This country has changed too much."" In an interview after the speech, he said he wished his policies had done more to improve the gap between those who have wealth and those who do not. ""It certainly weighs on me,"" he told PBS. ""In my first term, essentially, my job was to make sure, as you said, that the economy didn't just completely collapse."" 10 signposts on America's race journey . Other speakers Wednesday marked the great progress toward King's goal of racial accord, though many suggested that the dream was far from realized, specifically citing voter identification laws that critics say prevent African-Americans from casting ballots, and the verdict in the closely watched Trayvon Martin murder trial. ""We have come a great distance in this country in the 50 years. But we still have a great distance to go before we fulfill the dream of Martin Luther King Jr.,"" said U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, adding that progress toward King's goal could be marked by his own election to Congress. ""But there are still invisible signs, barriers in the hearts of humankind that form a gulf between us,"" said Lewis, the only speaker from the 1963 march who also spoke Wednesday. Another leader from King's era of the civil rights movement, Myrlie Evers-Williams, said the United States had ""certainly taken a turn backwards"" in the quest for civil rights. Two former presidents also delivered remarks Wednesday, each representing a distinct era in the movement for equal rights in America. President Jimmy Carter, speaking ahead of Obama, asserted that recent developments in American policy would have disappointed King. ""I believe we all know how Dr. King would have reacted to the new ID requirements to exclude certain voters, especially African-Americans,"" said Carter, a Democrat. ""I think we all know how Dr. King would have reacted to the Supreme Court striking down a crucial part of the Voting Rights Act just recently passed overwhelmingly by Congress."" And another Democratic president, Bill Clinton, argued during his speech for working together against stalemates and inaction, saying King ""did not live and die to hear his heirs whine about political gridlock."" Opinion: Did we really learn the lesson of the March on Washington? ""It is time to stop complaining and put our shoulders against the stubborn gates holding the American people back,"" Clinton said. Neither of the living former Republican presidents attended Wednesday's event. In fact, no elected Republican delivered remarks at the 50th anniversary commemoration. George H.W. Bush and his son George W. Bush both opted out, citing health concerns. The latter is recovering from a recent heart procedure. Before Obama addressed the throngs gathered at the Lincoln Memorial, civil rights leaders past and present remembered the decades-long movement to secure equal treatment and rights for African-Americans. The daughters of two presidents key to enacting the Civil Rights Act were also present: Lynda Johnson Robb and Caroline Kennedy, whom Obama recently nominated as ambassador to Japan. Celebrities and entertainers at the event included Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey, who star as husband and wife in one of the summer's hottest movies, ""Lee Daniels' The Butler,"" about life in the White House through the eyes of the (mostly black) hired help. Winfrey declared that King had seen injustice and ""refused to look the other way."" ""We, too, can be courageous by continuing to walk in the footsteps of the path that he forged,"" Winfrey said. Two musicians who performed at the 1963 march also sang Wednesday. Peter Yarrow and Paul Stookey, from the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, sang Bob Dylan's ""Blowin' in the Wind,"" backed by Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, the parents of Trayvon Martin, whose 2012 shooting death sparked a national conversation about race. Mary Travers, the third artist in the group, died in 2009. Obama's most personal remarks on race ahead of Wednesday's speech came in the aftermath of the July verdict that found Martin's killer not guilty. 5 faces of the March on Washington . In the crowd at the Lincoln Memorial, attendees used the occasion to remember where they were when they first heard King's ""I have a Dream"" speech. ""I grew up in a segregated environment. I never met a white person till I was a junior in college,"" said Betty Waller Gray, who traveled to Wednesday's march from Richmond. ""It was just so emotional to be here today after knowing where I was in 1963. I was just a kid finishing high school back then."" Gilbert Lyons, an employee of the National Park Service, attended the original March on Washington half a decade ago and heard King utter his famous works in person. ""I went home with it in my head. I even spoke to my wife about it,"" he said. ""It stayed with me. And the more I heard about Martin Luther King, the more things he was doing, I said, 'this man is great. He is a gentleman that can bring America back to themselves like they're supposed to be.' We're not supposed to be this race and that race. We are Americans."" The only class MLK ever taught .

"(CNN) -- When Hugh Jackman first called his director for ""The Wolverine,"" James Mangold told him that he had had an inspiration after reading the script. Mangold wanted to make the set-in-Japan film similar to ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" by making the mutant a Josey Wales with healing powers. Jackman hadn't seen the classic Clint Eastwood film, so Mangold sent him a copy. ""I felt like tonally, it would give him a clue of what I was talking about,"" the director said. The director started thinking about the deep affinity between gun-slinging Westerns and swordfighting samurai films. Mangold thought that drawing upon both of them would help ""The Wolverine"" stand apart from the rest of the X-Men series. This installment takes place after ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" as Wolverine retreats from killing the love of his life, Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix, and heads to Japan. It is based on the comic by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, and Mangold thought of it as Hugh Jackman in a Western in Japan, without the horse. To make sense of this movie mashup, the director tweeted images from the top ten inspirations for ""The Wolverine,"" daring fans to identify them. Astute fans of Mangold's body of work (which includes ""Cop Land,"" ""Walk the Line"" and ""3:10 to Yuma"") might have spotted the 1959 Yasujiro Ozu film ""Floating Weeds,"" since the director has cited it as one of the best films of all time as well as a major influence on his first film, ""Heavy."" ""Ozu is the most underappreciated Japanese director, in my mind,"" Mangold said. ""For me, the whole trip that Logan takes south to the Nagasaki area, it's almost the reverse train trip that the older couple take in 'Tokyo Story.' "" ""But it's also about that sense of the beauty and simplicity of rural Japanese life,"" he added. ""When I started scouting Japan, the world of the Ozu films still exists. You ride south; you find yourself in a simple fishing village, and it looks unchanged since the postwar period."" Depicting the atomic bomb being dropped on Nagasaki in ""The Wolverine,"" and the community's recovery, was a useful allegory for Jackman's character: ""Out of all the pain and the catastrophe and loss that he had suffered in his life, he's in a place that keeps going,"" Mangold said. ""They keep living, and they keep loving, despite the atrocities that have happened."" Also on the list of Mangold's top films of all time is 1947's Himalayas-set ""Black Narcissus,"" about a group of nuns establishing a convent. It was an influence on one of his most acclaimed films, ""Girl, Interrupted."" ""In regards to 'Girl, Interrupted,' it's a conscribed universe with these women all trapped in one place,"" Mangold said. ""But in 'The Wolverine,' it's the tone, which is both realistic and dreamy, the sense of travel to the exotic land and the buried sensuality in this new place."" Mangold planted one shot as a direct homage to ""Black Narcissus"" in ""The Wolverine"": when a woman runs out of a building and seems on the verge of throwing herself over a cliff into the sea. ""That's from the final sequence of 'Black Narcissus,' "" Mangold said, ""from when the nun who goes mad is chasing Deborah Kerr around and they show downward with the cliffs."" On the Western front, Mangold cites two classics: 1953's ""Shane"" and Eastwood's 1976 film ""The Outlaw Josey Wales."" "" 'Shane' is because of the dark outlaw who is brought into town, comes into a new village and changes everyone's lives but can never stay,"" Mangold said. ""He's a soldier of fortune, a vagabond. Logan is like that Western hero, a man who can never stop moving."" In ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" Eastwood's character loses his wife and children in the very beginning, and it sets him off on a journey built on his rage and loss -- which echoes not just in Logan's loss of Jean Grey but the perceived loss of his mentor, Dr. Charles Xavier, seemingly destroyed by the Dark Phoenix. ""It's also the journey,"" Mangold said, ""and how the enemy is not clear. It's kind of a labyrinth. And it's also about a wounded soldier trying to get home again. In the end of 'Josey Wales,' it's not like he's victorious against any enemy. He just literally finds a new place to live and love again and the courage to do it."" Then, of course, there are the samurai films such as the ""The Samurai Trilogy"": 1954's ""Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto,"" 1955's ""Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple"" and 1956's ""Samurai III: Duel at Ganryu Island."" ""The imagery is incredibly fantastical,"" Mangold said. ""It's not the kind of desolation you'd find in the Kurosawa films. They're extremely lyrical and colorful, with beautiful sets, beautiful design, beautiful use of color."" Two films noir are also on Mangold's list: William Friedkin's 1971 thriller ""The French Connection"" and Roman Polanski's 1974 neo-noir ""Chinatown."" Mangold said he values all of the films even beyond the inspiration they provided for his latest project. ""All of these movies are huge to me anyway,"" he said. ""And they spoke to me as I was working on the script and preparing for this shoot. But they've been touchstones to me all my life.""","James Mangold's latest film is ""The Wolverine""
The director said he was influenced by a wide array of films .
Mangold drew from westerns to noir in making ""Wolverine"""
"(CNN) -- Clashes broke out Saturday as far-right groups from across Europe gathered in Denmark for a rally they said was meant to make their governments act against the threat of Islamic extremism. Violence flared in the port city of Aarhus as a small group of far-left protesters broke off from a march staged to counter the right-wing rally, said Georg Husted, a spokesman for Aarhus police. Protesters carrying masks pulled up paving stones and started throwing them and other missiles, he said. One police officer suffered minor head injuries after he was struck by a bottle, Husted said, but no civilians were hurt or damage caused to buildings. Police arrested 25 people following the violence, said Husted, most of them from extreme left-wing groups. Between 200 and 300 people attended the far-right rally, according to police estimates, while about 5,000 people gathered for the anti-fascist demonstration. The left wing march was peaceful apart from the actions of a few ""hard core"" protesters who wanted to cause trouble, Husted said. The far-right rally brought together protesters from the Danish Defense League, as well as smaller groups from Scandinavian countries, Germany, Poland, Eastern Europe and the United Kingdom. Those attending want to send a ""clear message to the leaders of Europe,"" according to the English Defence League (EDL), one of the organizers of the far-right event. ""Our governments and our media behave as if Islamic extremism exists only in the head of a few extremists, and claim that it is unfair to make the connection between Islam and extremism,"" an online EDL statement said. ""This is ridiculous, just as it is ridiculous to claim that anyone who criticizes Islam must be an extremist in their own right. We believe in fair criticism of Islam and in the defence of our cultures, our nations, and the rights and freedoms that they have long protected."" Husted said ahead of the rally that police were focused on making sure the day passed peacefully without confrontations between the groups. ""We are going to support anyone who is going to talk and to demonstrate for what they feel, according to Danish law,"" he said. In its statement, the EDL said it does not believe that ""the way to combat extremism is with more extremism."" Racists and neo-Nazis are not welcome, and those supporting the rally have signed an agreement against extremism, it said. The British government has previously banned some marches by the EDL, whose members are widely seen as holding extremist views.","NEW: A police officer is injured as a handful of far-left and far-right demonstrators clash .

""I can only surmise the conditions of their clandestine detention and the adversity they each endure in solitude,"" he wrote. Gu was found guilty in August of the 2011 murder of British businessman Neil Heywood in a Chongqing hotel room. A family employee, Zhang Xiaojun, was also convicted in the killing and sentenced to nine years in prison. TIMELINE: Bo Xilai scandal . The elder Bo is due to face trial on Thursday charged with bribery, corruption and abuse of power. ""I hope that in my father's upcoming trial, he is granted the opportunity to answer his critics and defend himself without constraints of any kind,"" the younger Bo wrote. However, he adds: ""If my well-being has been bartered for my father's acquiescence or my mother's further cooperation, then the verdict will clearly carry no moral weight."" During her one-day trial, Gu issued a statement saying she didn't deny allegations that she poisoned Heywood, but she said she did so because she thought her son's life was in danger, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. Bo: Mother 'silenced' Bo wrote Monday that his mother had been ""silenced"" by the sentence, and was unable to defend herself against the ""opportunistic detractors that attack her reputation with impunity."" ""She has already overcome unimaginable tribulation after the sudden collapse of her physical health in 2006 and subsequent seclusion,"" he wrote. ""Although it is of little comfort to my anxiety about her state of health, I know that she will continue to absorb all that she is accused of with dignity and quiet magnanimity."" Position unravels . Before March 2012, the Bo family was considered part of China's political elite. The elder Bo was chief of the bustling metropolis of Chongqing, in the country's southwest. His wife, Gu, a high-flying lawyer, and their son were the beneficiaries of his family's wealth and connections at the top of Chinese politics. However, their privileged position started unraveling in March 2012, when Bo's right-hand man, then-Chongqing police chief, Wang Lijun, fled to the U.S. consulate in Chengdu with claims that Gu had been involved in Heywood's murder. Bo was subsequently stripped of his posts and disappeared from public view. 'Sheer rubbish' In one of his final statements, Bo condemned the treatment of his family, branding personal attacks as ""sheer rubbish."" ""A few people have been pouring filth on Chongqing and me and my family,"" Bo said. ""They even say that my son studies abroad and drives a red Ferrari. Sheer rubbish! I feel really furious. Sheer rubbish!"" In the weeks after the allegations emerged, photos of Bo Guagua wearing an unbuttoned shirt with his arms draped around female students at an Oxford college party started circulating on the Internet . The photos drew a cool response in China were the sons and daughters of the political elite are often perceived to enjoy special privileges and treatment out of reach of most Chinese. In an open letter published on the Harvard Crimson in April, 2012, Bo hit back at allegations he was living a ""party boy"" lifestyle. He denied ever having driven a Ferrari and said that, contrary to reports that he was coasting through his course, earned ""a 2:1 degree (Second Class, First Honours) overall and achieved a First in Philosophy."" Bo graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in May, 2012. He previously attended Oxford, graduating in 2010, and is reported to have recently enrolled in Columbia Law School.","Bo Xilai's son Bo Guagua issues statement before father's trial .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts State Police sergeant will be on desk duty pending the outcome of an internal investigation over his unauthorized release of photos showing the hunt and capture of one of the Boston bombing suspects. Boston magazine published the images Thursday, along with a story quoting Sgt. Sean Murphy. The sergeant said that a recent cover on Rolling Stone was ""an insult"" to the victims of the April terror attack because, in his view, it didn't portray Dzhokhar Tsarnaev the right way. Murphy was ""furious"" with the Rolling Stone cover photo of Tsarnaev, the Boston magazine story said, so the sergeant, a tactical photographer, provided the publication with grittier pictures from the harrowing hours after the bombing. These included an image of Tsarnaev during his capture with his face buried in his arm and what appears to be a red laser trained from afar on his head. Hours after the Boston magazine story appeared online, Murphy was relieved of duty with pay for a day, and State Police spokesman David Procopio told reporters that a hearing Tuesday before three state police commissioned officers would determine the sergeant's status. After the hearing Tuesday, attorney Leonard Kesten stood beside Murphy along with Dana Pullman, president of the State Police Association of Massachusetts. Pullman told reporters that Murphy had been placed on restricted duty, which he explained meant desk duty. Murphy is no longer a photographer, Procopio said. Kesten said that after the internal investigation into the release of the image is complete, ""terminating"" Murphy ""would be the wrong message to send to everyone."" There's little chance of that happening, according to Massachusetts State Police Superintendent Col. Timothy Alben who also spoke to reporters Tuesday. ""I don't see Sgt. Murphy being terminated for this particular set of circumstances,"" he said. A 25-year veteran of the state police, Murphy had worked most recently in the agency's public information office, covering many major operations, Alben said. The sergeant has been an ""exemplary"" employee with no disciplinary record. ""There no blemish there,"" Alben continued. ""He's a man of character. He's a man of honor."" Alben said he had no reason to doubt that Murphy was ""motivated by his own conscience and his own feelings about what occurred."" Kesten said that Murphy's actions would not affect the prosecution of Tsarnaev. ""The guy was captured live on TV -- helicopter shots,"" the lawyer said. But Alben was firm. ""If we get into a situation where we allow employees to cherry-pick and to choose what confidential information can be shared with the public or the media, impeding investigations or prosecutions, then we've lost integrity of the Massachusetts State Police,"" he said. The sergeant's teenage son also stepped in front of microphones to tell reporters that he was fully behind his father. ""My dad's kind of always been a huge hero to me, and throughout this process he's shown the characteristics that I hope to some day model myself after,"" Connor Patrick Murphy said. ""If I could be one-fourth the man he is now, then I could be happy with my life. Couldn't be prouder."" Different images and portrayals . The Rolling Stone cover showed Tsarnaev with tousled hair and a peaceful-looking face. An image Boston magazine said that Murphy provided showed the bombing suspect bloody, looking down, his shirt raised. ""This guy is evil,"" Murphy was quoted in the magazine. ""This is the real Boston bomber. Not someone fluffed and buffed for the cover of Rolling Stone magazine."" In the span of five days, more than 58,000 people have ""liked"" a Facebook page supporting Murphy, calling him a hero and lambasting the idea that his bosses would harshly discipline him. A message about the outcome of the hearing Tuesday got more than 700 ""likes"" within a couple of hours. What do you think of the Rolling Stone cover? ""If the powers that be do the right thing, they'll give Sgt. Murphy a medal, a long weekend off with pay, a new camera, and an apology,"" Richard C. Martin posted on the Facebook page. His comment alone garnered 160 likes. ""I support Sgt. Murphy for standing up for the victims,"" posted John W. Patterson, calling him ""a true hero for doing what he thinks is right."" But there were a few people who understood why the trooper is in trouble. Darin Vance, a 16-year-old from West Virginia, posted, ""I hate to see him lose his job, but what he did really was illegal; those pictures were not his, since he took them for his employer. Therefore, legally speaking, he stole the picture, and published it. I guess it depends how his contract was set up, but I think all copyrights would have been given over to the state."" Vance reiterated his support for the trooper to CNN on Monday and said he worried the Rolling Stone cover might inspire someone to commit an act of terror hoping to land on the front of a legendary magazine. Page organizer surprised . On Monday, CNN reached a woman who said she was the organizer of the page but would only give a first name -- Lisa. She said she felt compelled to create the page because her father was a Massachusetts State Police trooper. ""I thought this page would only be popular among my friends, but I'm getting private messages from people across the country, in Germany and in England, all over, who believe this trooper did the right thing,"" she said. ""I was so angry when I heard that Sgt. Murphy was going to suffer for trying to stand up for victims."" Fast Facts: Boston terror attack . Before quoting Murphy in several long passages, Boston magazine wrote: ""Here, in his own words, Murphy shares his thoughts on the Rolling Stone cover. He stresses that he is speaking strictly for himself and not as a representative of the Massachusetts State Police."" John Wolfson, Boston magazine's editor-in-chief, said the magazine has hundreds of photos similar to the ones Murphy provided and will publish more in its September issue. He said Murphy was ""conflicted on some level"" about releasing the photos but ""genuinely worried"" about how the Rolling Stone cover will affect the victims' families. The Rolling Stone cover unleashed a wave of intense reaction on social media that played out in brick-and-mortar stores. Three prominent New England-based businesses -- CVS pharmacies, Stop & Shop and Tedeschi Food Shops -- were among those that heard the public outcry and announced they would not sell the print edition of the magazine. Read more: Rolling Stone cover called a 'slap' to Boston . Some have defended the cover, arguing it draws much needed attention to a young man who seemed an unlikely terrorist. Rolling Stone issued a statement saying the story ""falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone's long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage."" ""The fact that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is young, and in the same age group as many of our readers,"" the statement read, ""makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of this issue and gain a more complete understanding of how a tragedy like this happens."" Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to federal charges in connection with bombings and is awaiting trial. His brother Tamerlan, suspected to have helped carry out the attack, was killed during a gunbattle with police. Read more: Suspect pleads not guilty .

"Muscat (CNN) -- The oil market is caught in a pricing tug of war. It is clear emerging markets are beginning a slowdown which will likely cut demand for crude oil over the next year. The panic selling in equity markets from Indonesia to India, Dubai to Sao Paolo is a leading indicator of what may be ahead in 2014. But at this juncture, the likelihood of military intervention in Syria, daily bombings and killings in Iraq, and uncertainty about the flow of crude through Egypt's Suez Canal are far outweighing concerns about the developing world's waning thirst for energy. Energy traders acknowledge the return of the so-called Middle East risk premium -- calculated to be $10 to $15 dollars a barrel. It is based on whether supplies might indeed be interrupted or, in the case of Iraq after four months of intense bombings, production has fallen below market expectations. For a record three years running, North Sea Brent crude has averaged more than $100 barrel. As a result, the dozen members of OPEC, dominated by the major producers of the Gulf, earned one and a quarter trillion dollars in 2012. This was, in part, because of the cloud of uncertainty that hovers over the region. Read more: Egypt's cycle of violence threatens to destroy country's fragile economy . It is a difficult balancing act. An escalation of violence triggered by military attacks on Syria is pushing crude well above what oil kingpin Saudi Arabia believes is a fair price of $100. This fills the coffers of the six Gulf states, who in a post-Arab Spring- environment are spending record amounts to fund economic development, create jobs and buy internal peace. Watch more: Struggling to survive in Syria . If crude gyrates higher -- as it did in 2008, when it surged past $145 a barrel -- future demand could plummet and so too could oil prices. This is what happened in the second half of that year, when prices fell to below $40. Oman's long-serving central bank chief, Hamood Sangour Al Zadjali, told me that many attempts are being made behind the scenes to return calm to the region. But when asked if there could be a further push on the upside for crude as a result of what is transpiring regionally, he said: ""That could be true, and that would be beneficial for us because we still depend largely on oil prices for our budget revenues."" Read more: Iraq: Why violence and oil don't mix . Oman sits near the mouth of world's busiest oil shipping lane, the Strait of Hormuz. It is now producing about 935,000 barrels a day, according to energy officials who spoke to me on background. The Sultanate's 2013 budget was built on oil projections of $85 a barrel, with energy making up 80% of total revenues. The near $25 premium over Oman's projections will wipe out a planned budget deficit, officials told me. While regional oil producers may be swimming in additional funds, the higher prices will hit the economies which are running current account deficits and are subject to the capital flight we see today. Watch more: Britain, France support action in Syria . Indonesia, India, Turkey top the list of the most vulnerable. With their currencies under severe pressure, there is the added danger of skyrocketing inflation due to higher imported energy costs. It may all sound a bit alarmist at this stage, with the mad dash of money out of emerging markets, but strategists suggest this is not the 1997--1998 Asian financial crisis all over again. Watch more: UN: Syria's chemical use unacceptable . Two years ago, countries such as Brazil complained their currencies were overvalued and that in turn was undermining export growth. Now we are in midst of the pendulum, and perhaps overshooting in the other direction. That may be today's narrative in a climate of so much uncertainty, but policymakers and energy planners in the region say it is way too early to call an end to the long term trend of rising emerging market demand. Oman's central banker is one of those. ""We think the growth momentum will continue in these countries and there will be demand for Omani oil,"" Al Zadjali told me. The country is banking on it, with BP and the government putting up to $20 billion into a new natural gas field. More tenders for additional exploration are in the pipeline, officials tell me. Oman, perched on the edge of the Arabian Sea, sees itself outside the region's real danger zones, Syria, Iraq and Egypt. But it is too early to suggest in this geo-political climate whether that will remain the case.","Energy traders acknowledge the return of the so-called Middle East risk premium -- $10 to $15 dollars a barrel .

"(CNN) -- The United States government requested information on more than 20,000 Facebook users in the first half of 2013, according to the social network's latest transparency report. This is Facebook's second transparency report and it includes much more information than the first. In it, Facebook shows the total number of requests made by each country, not just the United States. An alphabetized table of countries shows how many accounts were involved, and the percentage of requests that resulted in Facebook turning over at least some of the desired information to that country. The United States is the most interested in Facebook user data. It made between 11,000 and 12,000 requests for information from more than 20,000 Facebook accounts in the first six months of this year. (The government won't allow Facebook to report the exact numbers, only ranges.) Facebook complied with 79% of U.S. requests. Seventy-one countries submitted requests to Facebook. There were more than 26,000 total requests impacting at least 38,000 individual users. India submitted the second largest amount of requests, followed by the United Kingdom, German, Italy and France. Google has not yet released its report for the first half of 2013, but in the second half of 2012 it fielded more than 21,000 requests from 31 countries for more than 33,000 different users. Though transparency is the stated goal, people can only view Facebook's report if they are logged onto the social network. In the report, Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch said the company had high legal bars for the requests from governments, and emphasized that the company scrutinized each individual request. ""We fight many of these requests, pushing back when we find legal deficiencies and narrowing the scope of overly broad or vague requests. When we are required to comply with a particular request, we frequently share only basic user information, such as name,"" said Stretch. The report does not break out national security requests from the usual criminal inquiries, something that has drawn criticism from Google in the past. In June, following public outrage over revelations regarding electronic surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies, Facebook made a deal with the federal government about what information it could make public. After Facebook coughed up its first transparency report, Google released a statement criticizing the social network and the federal government because it didn't specify how many government requests were criminal versus national security related. ""Lumping the two categories together would be a step back for users. Our request to the government is clear: to be able to publish aggregate numbers of national security requests, including FISA disclosures, separately,"" said Google. In a FAQ under its new transparency report, Facebook does say that the ""vast majority"" of requests were about criminal cases. ""We continue to push the United States government to allow more transparency regarding these requests, including specific numbers and types of national security-related requests. We will publish updated information for the United States as soon as we obtain legal authorization to do so,"" reads the report.","Facebook's transparency report shows the number of requests from 71 countries .

"Doha, Qatar (CNN) -- Security guards outside the Taliban's new offices here said Thursday that they were empty and there was no one available to talk, but the building itself said plenty. The Taliban's white flag, which had flown Wednesday over the building, was lowered behind the walls of the compound, and a sign that had read ""Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan"" -- the name used by the group during its rule in Afghanistan from 1996-2001 -- was nowhere to be seen. Read more: Why is U.S. now brokering peace with Taliban? The symbols -- interpreted as signs that the office was representing an alternative government -- had infuriated Afghan President Hamid Karzai. He announced on Wednesday that Afghanistan was pulling out of peace talks with the Taliban and out of talks with the United States about a long-term foreign military presence in his country after the planned departure next year of Western military forces. Though the peace process remains a priority, ""the Afghan government will never allow for an Afghan peace process to be hijacked by the enemies of Afghanistan for reaching their nefarious designs that they have failed to achieve on the battlefield of war in Afghanistan,"" said Deputy Foreign Minister Ershad Ahmadi. The Afghan government's plans to negotiate this week with a U.S. team in Kabul were suspended ""so that we could signal our serious displeasure about the breach of the written assurances given to us by the U.S. government about the opening of the Taliban office in Doha,"" Ahmadi said in a statement. ""If the Taliban office in Doha is brought back into compliance with the written assurances given to us by the U.S. government, the Afghan government will review its decision about BSA negotiations with the U.S."" It was not clear Thursday whether the changes to the building in Doha would suffice to coax Karzai back to talks. His concerns came after the Taliban claimed responsibility for the deaths of four U.S. troops in a rocket attack on Bagram air base, which led a member of the House Armed Services Committee to lambaste the Taliban. Q&A: Why Taliban would talk as U.S. withdrawal looms . ""They cannot be trusted,"" said Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., R-California. ""And even if they give their word on something you can't know for sure that will filter down."" Karzai has a legitimate complaint, Hunter said. ""We are trying to legitimize the guys who are blowing up Americans and Afghans in Afghanistan."" Still, a senior U.S. administration official told CNN on Wednesday that peace talks between the United States and the Taliban will likely be held ""in the next few days."" The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not say when such talks might take place. Speaking Wednesday in Berlin, U.S. President Barack Obama said he wasn't surprised by Karzai's response. ""We had anticipated that at the outset there were going to be some areas of friction, to put it mildly, in getting this thing off the ground,"" Obama said. But he said that he believes Karzai remains committed to political reconciliation, and that he needs to be. ""We don't expect that it will be easy,"" Obama told reporters. ""But we do think ultimately we're going to need to see Afghans talking to Afghans about how they can move forward and end the cycle of violence so they can start actually building their country."" The Taliban opened the Doha office with a promise to renounce international terrorism and commit to peace negotiations, conditions the United States had set before it would support establishing the office as part of peace talks. The Taliban were expected to raise the issue of a possible exchange of a captured U.S. soldier for Taliban prisoners being held at Guantanamo ""in the coming days"" in Doha, State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said Thursday. She told reporters that U.S. officials were open to discussing the issue, but that no decisions had been made. ""This has been on the table since about Tuesday,"" said Col. Tim Marsano, a spokesman for the parents of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, 27, who was captured in 2009. ""Anytime that there are discussions and negotiations that may lead to the freeing of their son, that is encouraging news, especially after not much encouraging news over the past four years."" Karzai's decision on Wednesday to suspend the talks came a day after NATO-led troops transferred security responsibility to Afghan forces. Reported by CNN's Reza Sayah in Doha, written in Atlanta by Tom Watkins with contributions from Khushbu Shah in Atlanta, Chris Lawrence and Jill Dougherty in Washington, Paul Vercammen in Los Angeles and Masoud Popalzai in Kabul.","The flag has been lowered behind the walls of the compound .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese authorities have ended the waiting game over when political pariah Bo Xilai will face court over corruption charges. But the question remains as to what message his trial and punishment will send to the Chinese nation at a time when the Communist Party is pushing a mantra of anti-corruption and anti-excess. The Bo scandal emerged in March last year, just months before a once-in-a-decade leadership changeover that saw Xi Jinping replace Hu Jintao as president. At the time, the Chongqing chief was considered a high-flyer in the complex hierarchy of Chinese politics. That ended when his police chief fled, seeking asylum with a wild story which later proved to be credible, that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, and a family aide had murdered British businessman Neil Heywood. More than one year later, Bo was charged bribery, corruption and abuse of power. He'll face trial on Thursday, but Joseph Cheng, political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong, says the proceedings won't necessarily be about delivering justice. ""It's a political exercise,"" Cheng explained. ""It is not a trial per se but a political settlement."" Bo's punishment will in part be retaliation for his audacity in challenging Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping and other top party leaders by pushing his own ""Chongqing model"" and engaging in public grandstanding, he said. ""It is part of a political game,"" Cheng said. ""There have been rumors that many other top leaders were supporting Bo, that Bo had ambitions to replace Xi Jinping. Even after Xi was formally installed as party chief last November, political bargaining continued and involved the question of how to deal with Bo Xilai."" Cheng says Xi will be glad to see the end of the matter. ""Xi wants to clear the land mines ahead of the party meeting, which is expected later this year to launch reform and discuss economic and other important issues."" The leadership might want the issue out of the way, but Bo's punishment will send strong signals as to how serious the government is about cracking down on political corruption, some experts said. While the indictment didn't mention the specific amounts, sources tell CNN that Bo is accused of accepting about 20 million yuan ($3.3M) in bribes and embezzling six million yuan ($1M). As Chongqing chief, the charismatic Bo ruled with an iron-fist, cracking down on organized crime while promoting ""red culture"" that his critics said harked back to the authoritarian era under the late Chairman Mao. Admirers credited Bo for advocating social equality and justice by providing affordable housing, and jailing abusive officials and gangsters. Critics dismissed Bo as a ""clown in Chinese politics"" for acting like an authoritarian strongman who resorted to extra-legal measures to get rid of his enemies, and as a ""hypocrite"" who took in populist positions while enjoying a luxurious and privileged life. ""Bo Xilai's case is an individual case,"" said Chinese lawyer Shang Baojun. ""This has more to do with his personality. It doesn't mean anything. He might not be very corrupt, but his strong personality and many ridiculous activities like 'singing red and smashing black' have led to his downfall."" ""My conclusion is, the case itself doesn't mean much to China's anti-corruption campaign, but it sends a warning for people like him who would to anything to achieve their goals."" INTERACTIVE: China's leaders: Who's who . Mo Shaoping, a Beijing-based lawyer who has defended political dissidents, shares the skepticism. ""I believe that anti-corruption in China is a systemic issue, not just about an individual case,"" said Mo. ""Many ordinary citizens believe that all government officials are corrupt, and no one should be allowed to slip through. This may be an extreme view but it reflects the view that anti-corruption in China is a systemic issue."" Bo, 64, is a ""taizidang"" (princeling), a term which refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence. His late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Mao and former leader Deng Xiaoping. Over the past 30 years, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policy making body of the Communist Party. Bo caught public attention in 1993 when he became the deputy party secretary and mayor of Dalian. He was credited with the stellar success and transformation of Dalian from an unremarkable port to a modernized city. He was later appointed governor of Liaoning province in 2001. In 2004, Bo finally got the chance to enter the elite central committee where he moved to Beijing as the minister of trade and commerce. In 2007, he was given a seat on the Politburo and appointed party chief of Chongqing where he became well-known for running two major campaigns known as ""chang hong da hei"" -- singing red (revolutionary songs) and fight black (organized crimes). One was a campaign to promote China's communist past, including public singing of ""red songs"", harking back to old communist values that generated nostalgia for the days of Chairman Mao. The other was a messy crackdown on crime and mafias. The Chinese media is portraying the upcoming trial as a show of determination of the Chinese leadership to combat corruption. Some Chinese netizens agree. ""The indictment to Bo is already an improvement for Chinese legal system,"" wrote Zangrenxiongqi on Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblogging site. ""It shows the determination of the central government to fight against corruption."" ""This is to prove no matter how powerful the person is, as long as he or she violates the law, there will be punishment,"" chimed another netizen. But others remain skeptical. ""This is a fight among interest groups, and it is not the first time that this happens,"" Riyuezhiguangjushi posted on Weibo. ""When Jiang Zemin was in power, he removed (former Beijing mayor) Chen Xitong. It's understandable that Xi wants to eliminate Bo Xilai, even Deng Xiaoping has removed (Communist Party chief and rival) Hua Guofeng. This is politics, no right or wrong. It's just 'those who win become emperors, and those who lose become bandits'."" Bo's trial will be held in Jinan, the capital city of Shandong in eastern China, far away from his power base in Chongqing, where Bo still enjoys residual influence. The Chinese authorities are expected to tightly stage-manage events -- unless Bo refuses to follow the script. A source close to Bo's family told CNN that Bo denies the charges and looks forward to having the opportunity to defend himself in court -- if he is allowed to be heard publicly. That looks unlikely. The Central Propaganda Department has reportedly decreed: ""In coverage of the Bo Xilai trial, the media must use (the state-run) Xinhua wire copy without exception. Do not independently investigate and do not use material from other sources.""","Bo Xilai to face trial Thursday on charges of corruption, bribery and abuse of power .

"(CNN) -- The homeless man with a velvet voice catapulted into a new reality this week. Now how does Ted Williams, who has battled addiction, a rap sheet and the hardscrabble life of the streets, make sure his sudden success doesn't become a curse? A video of him and his ""golden voice,"" filmed by a multimedia producer with The Columbus Dispatch in Ohio, was posted Monday and went viral. Since then, he's been slammed with instant fame, become a battled-over TV talk show guest and received a slew of job offers. The abrupt about-face in his life has left many wondering how he'll handle all of this. ""You're taking someone who has nothing ... to having all the hopes and all the dreams,"" said Dr. Charles Sophy, a psychiatrist, author and medical director of the County of Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services. ""Right now, it's exciting. He can show his mom he's a success. But to sustain it we need to make sure he has what he needs."" What he needs, said Sophy, who has not met Williams, is a thorough evaluation of his history, of what's triggered his past substance abuse, and an adequate support mechanism. ""Giving someone success isn't always the answer to make sure someone feels successful,"" Sophy said. ""Unless someone's sobriety is really tight and well under control, success can trigger a relapse."" One thing Williams may have going for him is the man who's stepped in as his handler. ""I love Ted,"" Alfred Battle, a friend and his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, said in a written statement. ""We have been friends for many years and I have always known what a great talent he is and his well-being is first and foremost."" Battle also happens to be the founder and CEO of Battle Plan Promotions, a nonprofit entertainment company dedicated to developing ""undiscovered talent,"" according to a press release sent out Friday. In that release, Battle said he's been checking in with Williams over the years and offering assistance -- including occasional voiceover and concert announcement gigs -- ""whenever he would let me."" Doral Chenoweth III, the man who filmed Williams and was initially skeptical about Battle's role, has gotten to know the pair in recent days and shared stories he's gleaned of their history. Battle, a concert and event promoter, used to drive by a homeless shelter and camp looking for Williams, known in the community as  ""Radio Man."" He offered him gigs to emcee events or tape commercials.  Williams always wanted to go back to the shelter or camp, where he felt at home, Chenoweth said. CNN tried to reach Battle, but he did not respond to e-mail requests and his voicemail box was full -- perhaps an indicator of how busy and in demand Williams is. On Wednesday morning, Williams appeared in the Columbus studio of WNCI, where he took to the airwaves on the nationally syndicated Dave and Jimmy radio show before taking off for the New York talk shows and into the stratosphere of fame. Come Thursday afternoon, he had completed voiceover work for four commercials for Kraft Macaroni & Cheese. His first spot will air Sunday during ESPN's Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl. The two Columbus radio hosts, Dave Kaelin and Jimmy Jam, said they, too, are a bit worried about what all this sudden attention will mean for Williams. ""He even admitted that when you are a recovering alcoholic, it's the bad times and the good times that might trigger you,"" Kaelin said. ""There's no road map to this. This hasn't happened before. Seventy-two hours ago this man was standing on a corner."" The hosts said they had no idea what to expect when Williams strolled into the studio. But they were touched by his warmth and humility. What has happened since has left them overwhelmed in their own way. Jam said he's gotten more than 500 e-mails with offers to assist Williams.

After the initial tears that fell when they first embraced, Chenoweth said, ""She turns around, and she's mom."" Less than a minute into their taped reunion, in fact, his mother said, ""Please don't disappoint me."" ""I'm through with it all,"" Williams told her.

"(CNN) -- It may have been a simple misunderstanding that led to a horrific lynching. On October 5, four University of Port Harcourt students, Chiadika Biringa, Ugonna Obuzor, Lloyd Toku, and Tekena Elkanah left campus for the village of Aluu. According to Biringa's mother Chinwe, Obuzor was owed some money and he asked his three classmates to accompany him to the village to collect on the debt. Within minutes of their arrival, a rumor spread that the students were not there to collect but to steal. An enraged mob stripped them naked while beating them with sticks and rocks then wrapped car tires around their necks -- a form of torture known as ""necklacing."" As the four men sat on the muddy ground dazed and pleading for their lives, someone doused them with gasoline, lit a match and set them on fire. More: iReporters demand justice over brutal murders . The killing of the ""Aluu four"" was filmed and posted on the web for the world to see and now serves as a stark reminder of what can happen when the rule of law fails and communities turn to vigilante groups to carry out summary executions of criminal suspects, said Eric Guttschuss, Nigeria researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""Vigilante justice and mob justice generally takes place when there is a culture of impunity for crimes and in Nigeria, the Nigerian authorities have failed to crack down on this culture of impunity,"" Guttschuss told CNN. Mob justice is not unique to Nigeria and it would be unfair to characterize it as such. One infamous lynching in particular shocked the world and helped to spark the civil rights movement in the United States. In August 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till was beaten, his eyes gouged and shot in the head. His body was then thrown in the Tallahatchie River with a 70-pound cotton gin tied around his neck with barbed wire. His crime? Allegedly whistling at a white woman. Till's mother insisted on a public funeral service with an open casket showing the horribly mutilated and bloated body of her child so that the world would see the brutality of the lynching. Chiadika Biringa's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. ""I want the world to know how our security failed us. I want the world to know that my son and his three friends are innocent of what they said they did,"" Biringa said. According to news reports, the village of Aluu was on edge after several incidences of armed robbery -- and in a country where critics say corrupt police are sometimes considered more dangerous than criminals, mob justice is how many disputes ranging from pick-pocketing to kidnapping are often resolved. But Chinewe Biringa says her son and his friends were just innocent kids. ""He was a very kind hearted boy and we (were) so close,"" she said. ""If my son sees you 100 times he will greet you 110 times."" Biringa says the boys also had promising futures in music. They had already recorded a song together called ""Ain't No Love in the City"" -- a title she now says seems eerily like a premonition of what came to pass. ""It's almost as if they knew they were going to die,"" Biringa said. Biringa and her husband, Steven, an oil executive at Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), says that he watched the video because he wouldn't have believed it if he hadn't seen his son's killing with his own eyes. ""I want them to know from beginning to end the barbaric nature with which they chose hunt them down,"" he said. ""Even your worse enemy should not be treated in such form in the 21st century that people are still behaving and killing human beings as if they were rats."" The Nigerian police have arrested 13 people and, shockingly, one police officer who was on the scene and may have encouraged and even participated in the killing. While that officer is awaiting trial, the Nigerian police force has denied broader charges of rampant corruption and abuse. Spokesman Frank Mba says while Nigeria's police is not perfect, the police ""are committed to improving our competency through training and retraining and to improve our service, deliver to protect law and order and to stabilize democracy in Africa's largest country."" Guttschuss says it is not enough. He told CNN: ""Generally if you are the victim of a crime and you go to the police, you are asked to fund the criminal investigation. If you don't have the money to fund it and meet the incessant bribe to the police the case is often dropped. On the other hand, the criminal suspect, if he or she has the financial means, can simply pay off the police."" This is why these extrajudicial executions are still all too common across Nigeria. It is impossible to find official statistics, but a quick search of the words in YouTube pulls up dozens of clips showing what happens to someone accused of crime when a mob sets themselves up as judge and jury. This incident however, has seemingly galvanized the public. There are petitions and websites springing up to raise awareness of the issue and to pressure government and police officials. But many also say there are already laws against assault and murder which, when it comes down to it, is what mob justice is all about. For things to change, they say, the culture has to change. Chinwe Biringa believes her son is now a martyr, and hopes that his lynching will lead to change -- much in the way that Emmett Till's killing did. ""If justice is done, then I will be happy,"" she said. ""Because I know my son died a hero. He paid the price for Nigerian students in generations to come.""

"(CNN) -- Sometimes, it pays to eavesdrop on the next table over at lunch. That's how Brian Preston learned about the homeless people living in the woods around his suburban Georgia community. Today, some of those men have jobs and homes thanks to Preston, in a business collaboration that's not only producing expertly crafted furniture but restoring hope. Maybe it's because feel-good stories are hard to come by that the tale of Preston's carpentry outfit, Lamon Luther, has struck a nerve, earning a standing ovation last week from the audience at TEDxAtlanta, a series of independently organized talks modeled after the original TED conference. Turns out that what they needed were some tools and a chance, Preston, 31, told the audience. In return, they're helping keep alive a tradition of American craftsmanship that seems to be disappearing with each generation through Lamon Luther, which is named for Preston's grandfather, a farmer and carpenter from Georgia. It might not have happened if Preston hadn't overheard a conversation in 2009 in a restaurant in his hometown of Douglasville, Georgia, about ""the village in the woods."" Intrigued, he went to see for himself and discovered a makeshift camp where people lived in tents and shared firewood, propane and food that was stored in a hole in the ground. Some had recently left jail; others were builders and craftsmen who had fallen on hard times after the housing crisis of 2007 gutted the construction industry. Photos: 'Down and Out in the South' Preston, a married father of two, wanted to help. It hadn't been that long since his family had experienced rough financial times after losing their residential development business in the housing crisis. He and his wife sold most of their belongings so they could downsize to an apartment and start over. The more he got to know the men in the woods and learned about how they'd landed there, the more he felt he had narrowly avoided a similar fate, he says. ""I remembered calling and begging mortgage companies to help us out and wondering how we were going to put gas in the car,"" he said. ""I knew how easy it was to fall into that. Potentially, we're all just a few steps away from it."" Watch the TEDxAtlanta talk . He began making regular visits to the camp with loads of firewood, propane and other supplies to be divvied up among the residents. But his donations didn't seem to do much to improve the long-term prospects of the men who lived there, Preston said. Frustrated that he was enabling their destitution, he asked how he could help. The answer was simple, one man said: They needed jobs. They had no addresses, no cell phones and no licenses. ""'No one will hire us,'"" Preston's friend, Mitch, told him. It didn't take long for Preston to figure out how he could help in a way that would change his fortune as well. By this time, Preston had a ""safe"" job as creative director of a New Age church designing graphics and doing photography, he said. But he was a craftsman at heart and felt a piece of himself was missing. If a story was ever written about Preston's life at that point, ""no one would want to read it,"" he said. With the help of his wife and her addiction to Pinterest, the online pinboard for sharing decor and design inspiration, he'd returned to carpentry on the weekends, he told the audience. He began selling his work on Craigslist and demand grew steadily to the point where Preston wondered how he could transform his weekend hobby into a full-time job. Then, it hit him. On January 1, he picked up Roger Anthony Curtis, who goes by ""TC,"" from the camp and brought him to a workshop to see whether his carpentry chops were up to snuff after years of wandering around Florida and Georgia homeless. Preston was pleasantly surprised by what he saw and eventually hired two more men from the camp and another who was living in a trailer. Finally, Preston was seeing the change he'd hoped for. Soon, Curtis had saved up enough money to move out of the woods and into a group home, where he doesn't have to worry about the weather, leaky tents or where his next meal will come from, the 52-year-old carpenter said. ""I'm grateful for being able to meet new people and associate with people instead of hiding from them,"" said Curtis, who lived in the woods for eight months before moving out in the spring. ""It's great being able to buy the things that I need, go places I wanna go to and I just enjoy working with my hands again."" Scott Miller, who was the de facto leader of the camp, had earned enough money to move into a group home after just one month working for Preston. ""Now, I'm able to provide for myself,"" Miller, 30, said in an interview before TEDxAtlanta. ""I felt like I was the lowest person on the totem pole. It's really brought my self-esteem way up in life since I've come out of these woods."" Preston's four employees are keeping busy at work and outside the shop as they rebuild their lives. None of them lives in the woods and one who was an absentee father is rekindling a relationship with his daughter. Preston is also seeing bottom line results with orders from clients including Chik-fil-A and smaller custom orders. While he's proud of their work, he believes a lot of the interest comes from Lamon Luther's story, as both the continuation of his grandfather's legacy and the start of a new one for his employees -- homeless or not. ""We like to say, provide hope for the craftsman, not necessarily guys who are homeless. It's more about giving work to out-of-work craftsman who were created to build,"" he said. ""We give them hope,"" he told the TEDx audience. ""If we put these folks back to work we could save entire communities.""","Lamon Luther employs carpenters and builders who lost their livelihoods .

"(CNN) -- The irony was not lost on most viewers of the Greek Prime Minister's statements as he replied to the public outcry over the hasty shutdown of ERT, the country's national broadcaster, with the immediate layoff of over 2,600 employees. Like a wolf in sheep's clothing, Antonis Samaras was chastising a system that his own New Democracy party had helped to ingrain in Greek society and political life. Speaking at an award ceremony organized by the Athens Chamber Of Commerce And Industry (EVEA), he labeled ERT a ""symbol of corruption and waste,"" and claimed it ""controlled the flow of information without any accountability."" Constantly repeating righteous keywords such as ""transparency,"" he tried to justify his decision to pull the plug on ERT's national and regional TV channels and radio stations around the country, which Greek taxpayers had been paying for for the past 75 years. Newly-unemployed former ERT employees rebutted these attacks by issuing a statement revealing publically what had been common knowledge in Greece's journalistic circles: the final word always lies with the heads of the organization -- appointed by Mr Samaras. Namely, they pointed out ""it was the General Director of ERT Emilios Liatsos who decided that the anniversary of the Paraskinio newspaper was more newsworthy than the tortures at GADA."" Last October, in an article that led Greek Public Order Minister Nikos Dendrias to threaten the Guardian with legal action, anti-fascist protesters claimed they had been tortured by the police at the Attica General Police Directorate (GADA). The GADA denied the claims. Back then, the government that now champions transparency, went so far as to suspend ERT's morning show hosts, Kostas Arvanitis and Marilena Katsimi for criticising Dendrias's response to the incident. Only after this week's announcement of ERT's closure, under a Presidential Decree, did its employees feel free to broadcast uncensored. Only in the final hours before the shutdown was economist and writer Yiannis Varoufakis able to reveal on TV that he had been banned from that very channel for two years, and that on one of his appearances, TV presenter Elli Stai had asked him not to mention the words ""debt restructuring."" Of course, a portion of the public were aware of government-imposed censorship, and some even endorsed Samaras' recent drastic move. But in a country where unemployment has reached a record 27.4 per cent and cronyism has been the rule of the day for decades, it's slightly naÃ¯ve to believe the coalition government leader's claims of cleansing and of a will to reinstate transparency. The shutdown was met with mixed feelings, not just among the viewers but also among the journalists themselves, with some complaining about ERT's lack of support towards the rest of the media world that had been facing layoffs and company closures for more than three years. ""The journalists should have already revolted on behalf of the pensioners,"" one commentator said. This attack on freedom of speech, still reverberating in the Greek and international press, has also divided the fragile coalition government itself. The leaders of the other two junior coalition parties, PASOK and Democratic Left, say they oppose Samaras' decision, but are open to a reasonable compromise. The New Democracy leader needs their support for his decision to become law -- the alternative will render the coalition unsustainable. PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos said his party ""doesn't want elections, but we're not afraid of them either."" Speculations about an imminent general election is already circulating in the Greek press, but Venizelos and Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis' need to cling to power is likely to make them go along with Samaras' decision. They might try to buy time, since at the moment international attention and support for ERT is overwhelming. The absolutist way in which Samaras chose to act on his decision triggered a media revolt which was long overdue, with blogs, websites and EBU streaming ERT's service online. Reporters Without Borders' executive director Christophe Deloire deplored the closure, explaining that such media shutdowns are ""usual in dictatorships and rare in democratic countries."" The question of whether Greece, formerly known as the cradle of democracy, still lives up to the title is a persistent one. What is certain is that the current form of democracy is deeply flawed and, unsurprisingly enough, the media and the way they have operated for decades are part of the problem. But switching off the state broadcaster will only exacerbate the problems, derailing democracy. A publicly-funded broadcaster is by definition crucial to media pluralism, simply because it doesn't have to make the financial choices privately-funded ones face -- especially in a country where the owners of private media firms are business magnates, whose aim is to influence the political world. Samaras and his coalition partners lack any credibility that would make a cleansing of the organisation possible. The Greek PM might claim he wants to get rid of the ""corrupt"" and ""sinful"" ERT only to establish a new, efficient organisation with only 1,000 employees, but the question is, given the track record of his party, who believes him? ""We have a short span memory, we Greeks,"" he said last Wednesday. He must surely hope so. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- My early childhood was a bit of a trip. I was born in the United Kingdom, then moved to Portugal, Venezuela and eventually New Jersey. When I was about 7, I had a series of severe ear infections. At the time, my family had no money, and we didn't have insurance, so there was no option to take care of it. I ended up losing full hearing in my right ear and 80% hearing in my left. When I began attending public school, I didn't understand how the severity of my hearing loss would affect me; neither did my parents or my teachers. There were many issues when it came to grades due to miscommunication between the teachers and me. They often thought I was ignoring them. Eventually, when I was 11, my parents started to pick up on it, which led to a doctor visit. My mother and I were told that I had significant hearing loss and that the hearing I had left was not guaranteed to stay. My mother had a hard time dealing with the news at first. It was one more obstacle that we were going to have to deal with as a family, and she knew it was bound to cause a hard time for me at school. When it came time to decide whether to go to a school for the deaf or continue in public school, I made the choice to stay where I was. My mother was a bit uncomfortable with the situation, but my fear of being labeled as different played a big part in my decision. I also decided I was just going to keep my hearing loss to myself. Eventually my friends figured it out. It didn't really change anything between us, but from time to time, some other kids would make fun of me. One day in middle school a kid started making fun of me and mocked his own stereotypical idea of what a deaf person would speak like. One of my good friends, Chad Foster, stopped me from thinking or doing anything negative and told me it wasn't worth it. He said there will always be ignorant people like that in life, and I just have to brush it off -- to be me and that's all that mattered. He also told me he had my back. But I still had trouble looking at school the same way. That incident brought reality into my life at an early age, so I kept to myself with my close friends. My career as a DJ began in college. My parents owned a restaurant, and my father gave me the opportunity to DJ a party one night. I immediately fell in love with the turntables and began to DJ more and more. From there I started DJ'ing at clubs in the tri-state area, from New Jersey to New York to Connecticut, and eventually also in Atlanta and Chicago. I started to get a following in those states, even as I continued to attend Kean University to get my bachelor's degree in biology. Then I had to drop out of college my junior year due to financial trouble in a bad economy. DJ rocks despite hearing loss . However, I stuck with my passion of spinning music, and after nearly a decade, I was granted a great opportunity. Hewlett-Packard took notice of what I was doing and what my movement stood for. We shot and aired a global commercial, which began a positive snowball effect for my career. Doctors tell me there is a procedure that could restore my hearing. One day, when I have the time and money to get my hearing fixed, I probably will have the procedure done. But right now, I need to be on the forefront with my team, fighting for the issues in society that are too often overlooked. I intend to do so through my career in music and philanthropy. Plus, there are just some things in life better off not being heard. When it comes down to it, life's not about all the small negative things you encounter. It's about being yourself and doing what you love to be happy. If you love something so much and have great passion for it, then just go for it. My team and I like to use the expression ""Why not ... ?"" Just ask yourself, why not?","DJ Robbie Wilde lost full hearing in his right ear and 80% in his left .

"(CNN) -- Starbucks continues to brew controversy, as opposing sides of the nation's gun debate clash over the giant coffee chain's policy to support state ""open-carry"" laws for legal firearms and, where permitted by law, to permit guns in their stores. On Friday, the Newtown Action Alliance, a grassroots organization founded by Newtown, Connecticut, residents in support of gun policy reform, posted on its website an open letter to Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, encouraging him to ban guns in all Starbucks stores. ""If you make the decision to ban guns, your company has the chance to honor the 26 innocent lives lost here in Newtown and the 32,000 Americans lost annually to gun violence by becoming a leader in educating the public about firearm safety. We know by having observed and admired your continuing advocacy that your company not only understands but takes pride in its responsibility to promote the growth of a safe and just society,"" the open letter said. ""That is why we would like you to invite you to join us for a cup of coffee at our Starbucks in Newtown at a time and date of your convenience so we can talk about your company's policy and gun violence in America..."" the letter continued. The letter was signed by 13 family members of victims in the deadly December shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, including the family of Lauren Rousseau, a teacher and Starbucks barista who was killed. Many other Newtown residents also signed the letter, as did Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, Sen. Chris Murphy, Sen. Richard Blumenthal. Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson responded Friday by saying, ""We welcome the opportunity to meet with the Newtown family members who have signed this letter to discuss their concerns."" On Wednesday, the group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America -- an organization for what its members term common-sense gun reforms -- called for a national boycott of Starbucks stores on Saturday. On its website, the group is attempting to gather 25,000 signatures calling for a ban on guns at all Starbucks stores, and plans to hand-deliver the petition to Starbucks headquarters. ""Millions of American moms visit neighborhood Starbucks, often with their children in tow. But many moms don't realize that they may be standing next to someone carrying a loaded gun inside Starbucks,"" the group said. The organization allied with the Newtown Action Alliance and other gun law-reform groups on Friday, placing its support behind the signers of the letter to Schultz. Starbucks was most recently brought into the gun debate when gun rights advocates staged a national ""Starbucks appreciation day,"" in support of the coffee shop's open-carry policy. ""Starbucks is allowing us to lawfully carry firearms in their store. Recently, they have been the target of unjust attacks from certain groups that do not support our right to bear arms. We will thank starbucks (sic) for standing up for our right to bear arms by going there on Friday, August 9th,"" said the Facebook page for the event. The Starbucks in Newtown closed that day, but the debate raged on. In a statement to CNN at the time, Starbucks spokesman Olson said, ""These events are not endorsed by Starbucks. That said, our stores are gathering places for the communities we serve and we respect the diverse views of our customers...We comply with local laws and statutes in the communities we serve, abiding by the laws that permit open carry."" Friday's letter to Schultz further challenged Starbucks' stance. ""Since your company has been a champion of admirable causes in the past, such as LGBT rights and environmental sustainability, some gun owners in this country cite Starbucks' stance on this issue as justification of the reasonableness of their choice to carry guns anywhere and everywhere, even into a place as unthreatening as a coffee shop...we as a society must prioritize the sanctity of human life over the individual's 'right to carry,"" the letter said. CNN's Poppy Harlow and Laurie Frankel contributed to this report.","Where state law allows, legal guns are permitted to be carried in Starbucks stores .

"(CNN) -- At least 12 people were killed and dozens were injured Wednesday in separate attacks in Afghanistan, including an insurgent assault near a post for coalition and Afghan forces, local authorities said. In the eastern Afghan city of Ghazni, insurgents killed at least six civilians and two Afghan troops -- and injured 57 other people -- in an attack near a Provincial Reconstruction Team compound Wednesday afternoon, the provincial governor, Mosa Khan Akbarzada, said. The Taliban claims responsibility for the attack, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. The assault began when a suicide bomber detonated his car near the PRT compound, according to Akbarzada. Then six attackers opened fire on Afghan troops, he said. Most of the casualties were women and children, according to Akbarzada. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force confirmed the attack involved a a suicide vehicle bomb, indirect fire and small arms fire. It declined to say whether its personnel were injured. Earlier Wednesday, in a suicide car bomber killed four people and injured 15 more in southern Afghanistan's Helmand province, a government official said. The attacker rammed his car, laden with explosives, into a military convoy in Lashkargah, Helmand province spokesman Omar Zwak said. He believes the bomber was targeting foreign soldiers, but all who died were civilians, he said. CNN is seeking comment from the ISAF on possible coalition casualties. There has been no claim of responsibility for the Helmand attack. Roadside blasts in Helmand province, which is in southern Afghanistan, killed eight people earlier this month. Wednesday's attacks came a day after Taliban fighters opened fire on coalition fuel trucks in southwest Afghanistan, killing six drivers and injuring 10 other people, according to a local official. At least 40 of the ISAF vehicles burned in the attack in Farah province, said provincial government spokesman Abdullrahman Zhwandai. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the Farah attack. Civilian casualties in Afghanistan increased 23% in the first six months of this year, the United Nations said in a report released at the end of July. The increase in deaths and injuries so far this year was mainly driven by the stepped-up use of improvised explosive devices, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said in its report. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","Taliban claims responsibility for attack that killed at least 8 people in Ghazni .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Tino Schaedler's impact as a virtual set designer is the result of years of experience in architecture and visual effects. Tino Schaedler is a digital set designer who has worked on ""The Golden Compass"" and a ""Harry Potter"" film. Described as something of a ""chimera,"" Schaedler seems to thrive on working on a variety of projects. He is a leading authority on progressive film design, an established art director, digital set designer and trained architect. An acclaimed designer, Schaedler has created digital sets on on several big-budget movie productions, including Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""The Golden Compass"" and ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."" Schaedler worked for three years in the offices of Daniel Libeskind and Barkow Leibinger architects before moving into the film industry. During his three-year stint with the renowned architects, Schaedler also took up a teaching position at the University of Fine Arts in Berlin where he taught Studio Digital Analog for three semesters. ""Through my work with the students I realized my interest in film and also for narrative spaces, because that was kind of the bridging element for me,"" Schaedler explained to CNN. He later studied at the Berlage Institute in Amsterdam, UC Berkeley, USA and the Vancouver Film School in Canada. This is where he realized the potential for architectural design and representation using 3D modeling software packages, which he has used extensively to design his new age sets. He has since established himself as a forward-thinking artist, one who embraces rapidly changing technology. Schaedler is a member of the Art Directors Guild in Los Angeles and its Technology Committee. He recently received an award for excellence in production design from the guild for his work on ""The Golden Compass."" Schaedler was born in Hanover, Germany in 1972 and studied architecture at the University of Hanover. In 2007 he co-founded NAU, a cross-disciplinary design collective positioned between architecture and film with Michael J. Brown and Jean-Lucien Gay. He has also been working in a new project entitled ""Immersive Space"" (Cocoon), which is developing new ways of interacting across the web and beyond in 3D.

"(CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot will stand trial beginning January 6 on robbery and murder charges related to a 21-year-old woman's death, a Peruvian court announced Friday. The timetable from the Superior Court of Lima came days after a panel of judges ruled against having the Dutch national face an even more stringent slate of charges, as the victim's family members had requested. Instead, he will face the original charges levied against him -- which, if he is convicted on all counts, could lead to a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. Van der Sloot is accused of killing Stephany Flores in his Lima hotel room last year. Police say he took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. He was charged in September with ""qualified murder"" and simple robbery, which carry sentences of 28 years and two years, respectively. The victim's family asked a three-judge panel for a charge akin to aggravated murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The panel ruled against the family and in favor of prosecutors' original indictment. Van der Sloot's defense attorney, Luis Jimenez Navarro, then told InSession that the judge's decision was a major victory for his client. If van der Sloot is found guilty and sentenced to the maximum penalty, under Peru's jail reduction credits, he might serve only a third of the term. As of early next month, van der Sloot will have spent 18 months in Peruvian prison. Jimenez has previously said that his client could confess to a charge of simple homicide. Despite the panel's decision, the Flores family has remained hopeful that van der Sloot will face more serious charges. A family attorney said that because of the way the justice system works in Peru, the charges could change once the trial begins. Van der Sloot was once the prime suspect in the case of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway, who vanished while on a graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba. He was arrested twice but never charged in connection with Holloway's disappearance, which is still unsolved. He also faces extradition charges to the United States. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted van der Sloot on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother. He was given a total of $25,000, and authorities believe he used that money to travel to Peru and participate in a poker tournament, where he met Flores.

"(CNN) -- Most of us assume that our doctors are trustworthy. They undergo a minimum of seven years of postgraduate schooling, pass rigorous tests and are responsible for our health and the health of our families. But are they as trustworthy as we think? A Michigan oncologist was arrested recently for allegedly running a multimillion-dollar scheme to defraud Medicare. He's accused of administering chemotherapy to patients with no real chance of survival and misdiagnosing patients in order to charge for their expensive treatments. And earlier this month an Ohio spine surgeon was indicted on charges that he persuaded patients to undergo millions of dollars worth of treatments that they didn't need. Among the things he allegedly told patients was that their heads would fall off without his operation. While these egregious stories are truly shocking and uncommon, there are unfortunately many less dramatic examples of untrustworthy doctors that don't make big news. My field of cosmetic plastic surgery has its share of doctors who don't necessarily place their patients' best interests first. I encounter these patients' subsequent problems nearly every week. One middle-aged woman was left with scarred legs resembling a burn patient's after undergoing unnecessary laser liposuction by a cardiologist. Another was abandoned by his ENT surgeon after undergoing a lunchtime facelift and contracting a staph infection. One woman underwent a botched tummy tuck by an emergency room physician, leaving her abdomen a scarred, lumpy mess. How surgeons build new breasts . So what's a patient to do? Here are some tips to make sure your physician, and the advice he or she gives you, are trustworthy: . Research your doctor. The easiest way to do this is online. There are several doctor-rating websites where patients share their reviews and experiences with physicians. You can also check with your state's Board of Medicine to determine whether your physician has had his or her license suspended or revoked. County courts can also provide information regarding any lawsuits your doctor may have been involved with. Keep in mind, though, that we live in a litigious society, and even the best doctors get sued, often more than once. Make sure your doctor isn't practicing outside his/her field. This is mainly a problem in plastic surgery, where doctors of all kinds are ditching their chosen specialties to masquerade as cosmetic surgeons. If you're considering plastic surgery, make sure your surgeon is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, or better yet, is a member of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. If you're considering facial plastic surgery, then the American Board of Facial Plastic Surgery is considered an equivalent in all states. Getting back at your ex -- by getting surgery . Be cautious of doctors who advertise too much. The quality of a doctor is often inversely proportional to the size of his or her ad. Young, new physicians may use ads to introduce themselves to the community, but once word of mouth kicks in, most doctors don't need to pay for a lot of expensive advertising in order to maintain a busy practice. Ask a nurse or other hospital support staff. Hospital workers know who the good and bad doctors are in town. Ask who they go to for advice or treatment. Get a second opinion. If you're undergoing treatment with a specialist and aren't comfortable with the doctor's recommendations, ask your primary care physician what he or she thinks. Or get a second opinion by another specialist in the same field. While stories of unethical physicians are indeed concerning, the majority of doctors are honest, ethical people who place their patients' best interests first. We just don't hear about it in the media. Doctors contribute billions of dollars worth of pro bono care every year. Thousands of doctors staff inner-city and rural clinics to help the disadvantaged at a fraction of what they would earn in an upper-class neighborhood. And we don't often recognize the doctors who get out of bed in the middle of the night to tend to a person injured in a car accident, a woman about to give birth, or an ICU patient on the brink of death. So should you trust your doctor? Yes. After you do your research. Suffering from tattoo regret .

"(CNN) -- Evidence of another deadly attack in Syria has surfaced, this one with an incendiary agent, opposition activists said Friday. Seven people died and dozens were wounded Monday in the attack on a school in northern Syria, they said. The allegation comes as U.S. President Barack Obama considers military action against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after what U.S. officials and chemical weapons experts say was a chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21. Videos that activists said had been shot in the Urum Al-Kubra village of Aleppo province after the Monday attack show people with severe burns, but no other external injuries. Bergen: Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S. Some people reported hearing nothing before chemicals started to burn them. ""It's like they used chemicals, like napalm or something,"" said a doctor at a local hospital who confirmed the casualties. ""It's causing a lot of burns."" CNN has not been able to independently confirm the accounts. An expert who saw the videos, which were broadcast Thursday on the BBC program ""Panorama,"" said they did not appear to show the aftermath of a chemical weapons attack. What do Syria's neighbors think? ""You could see burns around the school, the playground, it looked like there had been a fire,"" said Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, in a telephone interview. ""Chemical weapons don't cause that sort of destruction. Hay, who advises the British government on chemical weapons issues, applauded Parliament's decision not to back British involvement in military action against the government in Damascus. ""I think the U.N. process should be allowed to run to completion,"" he said, referring to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's request that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons carry out an investigation on his behalf. The OPCW oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons and has been signed by 189 countries. Syria has not. Why Russia, China, and Iran are standing by Syria . If the OPCW were to find that chemical weapons had indeed been used, that would pressure China and Russia -- which have signed it -- to support some action against Syria, Hay said. ""These governments have been supportive of the OPCW; it would be very difficult for them to ignore a report produced by the OPCW's inspectors."" It is the indiscriminate nature of chemical weapons that puts them in a particularly abhorrent category, noted Hay, who said he was confident they had been used in Syria. ""All of the features that I saw in all the videos that I've seen, with individuals having no evidence of trauma, having great difficult breathing, suggests exposure to something that is causing asphyxia,"" he said. ""Chemical agents in the nerve-agent category do this."" Still, he added, ""I'd like to see the final proof."" Does the public care about U.N. support? If the OPCW were to conclude that chemical weapons had been used, the debate would then turn to who used them. The manufacture of chemical weapons such as sarin is a technique known to very few, he said. ""It's a very dangerous process because the chemical is so toxic, and you have to make sure that there's protection for those involved in making it. Otherwise, they will die."" Putting the chemicals into a weapon requires another set of skills that are known to very few people, he said. ""It's not something you can do in your lockup or your garage; it would, obviously, point to somebody like a government having these weapons."" Obama's talk about the use of chemical weapons crossing a ""red line"" appears to have put him into a corner, Hay said. ""It's difficult to know how he's going to back out of that one, without some kind of punitive strike."" Hay said he hoped any military action would not be against al-Assad's chemical weapons stockpiles because ""that runs the risk of spreading these agents even further."" Syrian crisis: Latest developments . The alleged use of chemical weapons in the August 21 attack in a suburb of Damascus was only the latest of more than a dozen such reports in recent months, according to Jon Day, the chairman of Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee. ""We have assessed previously that the Syrian regime used lethal CW (chemical weapons) on 14 occasions from 2012,"" he said Thursday in a two-page report to Prime Minister David Cameron. If what Day described as ""a clear pattern of regime use"" of chemical weapons has indeed been established, why did the latest report spark a more bellicose response from world powers? Part of the answer lies in the scale of the event, in which hundreds of people are reported to have died, said Dr. Howard Hu, a consultant on chemical weapons for Physicians for Human Rights and dean of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. In addition, the evidence is strong, he said. ""This time, there was enough videotaped evidence of victims subsequent to the attacks to provide a level of detail that allowed observers like myself to see signs that were consistent with an acute response to a nerve agent. And that level of specificity, I think, also increased the level of certainty and urgency to this."" Hu noted the August 24 report by Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders. It cited information from three hospitals it supports in Syria's Damascus governorate that said some 3,600 patients had arrived at one of the hospitals within a three-hour time span showing neurotoxic symptoms, and that 355 of them died. ""Medical staff working in these facilities provided detailed information to MSF doctors regarding large numbers of patients arriving with symptoms including convulsions, excess saliva, pinpoint pupils, blurred vision and respiratory distress,"" said Dr. Bart Janssens, MSF director of operations. Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday that U.S. intelligence information found that 1,429 people were killed in the attack, including at least 426 children. Patients were treated with atropine, a drug for neurotoxic symptoms. Janssens said the group could neither confirm the cause of the symptoms nor identify who was responsible. However, he added, ""the reported symptoms of the patients, in addition to the epidemiological pattern of the events -- characterised by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time, the origin of the patients, and the contamination of medical and first aid workers -- strongly indicate mass exposure to a neurotoxic agent. This would constitute a violation of international humanitarian law, which absolutely prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons."" Hu said that the reports of medical personnel winding up with some of the same symptoms suffered by their patients ""is very consistent with a toxic CW agent causing secondary effects. So, put it all together, it's a very, very compelling case."" Charles P. Blair, a senior fellow on state and non-state threats at the Federation of American Scientists, said Thursday that the August 21 report stands apart from the others in the number of reported casualties. But questions remain about all of the reported cases -- as to what agents may have been involved and who was responsible, said Blair. ""I think it's likely the Assad regime has (used) sarin on potentially two occasions, maybe three that we know if, but it's done so using very, very small quantities of it,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""And it's used primarily to dislodge entrenched opposition forces and probably to test the international community"" to see how it responds, he said. That would not explain the apparently large use reported in the August 21 attack, which crossed the administration's oft-repeated ""red line,"" he said. ""If it was a chemical attack, if it was the Assad regime, it was such an egregious and completely irrational use of chemical weapons that the administration had to respond,"" he said. But that has left the administration in a dilemma, he said. ""There's nobody on the ground right now that they can identify that they can back safely without the risk of that group being overrun or taken over by the jihadist groups in Syria."" In other words, the jihadists could wind up being empowered if the Obama administration carries out an attack, he said. ""If they don't play this right, the leadership in Damascus could be jihadist -- with a large chemical weapons arsenal at their disposal."" Blair proposed three theories about why the Syrian regime might have carried out the attack: . -- It is playing an ""incredibly complex chess game, playing like what Spock used to play -- it makes sense to them, but we can't even figure it out;"" -- The regime is beginning to disintegrate and the attacks were carried out by rogue elements and was not authorized; . -- The leadership has lost touch with reality. Attacking the regime would be a risky move, he said. ""You don't know the response. They could launch Scuds at Israel full of sarin."" Another concern: the command and control over the country's vast stocks of chemical weapons could be delegative, meaning that subordinates in the field may have the power to launch the stocks if certain conditions are met. ""So, if the United States destroys x,y and z, it could actually trigger a response from commanders in the field."" And Blair added that he was not persuaded that chemical weapons have indeed been used. ""There's nothing available in open sources that they definitively have been,"" he said. Verification is critical given the U.S. government's history of being duped about the alleged weapons of mass destruction that preceded the U.S.-led attack on Iraq. ""Words can't describe how catastrophic it was,"" Blair said. ""Most people in the community are skeptical.""","It does not appear to be a chemical weapons attack, expert says .
Professor says he's confident chemical weapons have been used, but wants proof .
Russia, China have signed the Chemical Weapons Convention ."
"(CNN) -- Even before Manchester United and Chelsea kicked off at Old Trafford on Monday, there was ample intrigue. With Chelsea making no secret about its interest in United striker Wayne Rooney, would the Englishman start? Rooney, who United repeatedly insist isn't for sale despite the 27-year-old putting in a transfer request at the end of last season, did make the starting 11 and played the full 90 minutes. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, meanwhile, didn't start a recognized striker, leaving $78 million man Fernando Torres on the bench. He again omitted Chelsea's player of last season, creative midfielder Juan Mata. In the end, both teams maintained their unbeaten start to the young season thanks to a mostly dour 0-0 draw. In David Moyes' first home game in charge since replacing Alex Ferguson, the scoreless tie was the first in the league at Old Trafford in four years. The pre-game hype thus made for more fun than the game itself and the post-game comments from both managers provided yet more entertainment. With reports of a club other than Real Madrid making a late bid for Tottenham winger Gareth Bale, a smiling Moyes didn't deny United was the team in question. ""Manchester United will always be interested in the best players,"" Moyes told Sky Sports. ""We're always looking to try to improve the team and the owners have given me every opportunity to bring in whoever I want."" Mourinho didn't rule out Chelsea making a third bid for Rooney, although he acknowledged the support the England international received from the crowd would make it difficult for him to leave. Rooney's shift was full of commitment, particularly evidenced when he tracked back late to dispossess Ramires. He was arguably United's best player. ""(United fans) supported him all the way so I think this is a real special club with special fans and I think probably now he decides he wants to stay,"" Mourinho told Sky. Chelsea went top of the standings with seven points through three games, having contested a game more than its rivals when the fixture against Aston Villa was moved up due to the Blues' upcoming Super Cup clash against Bayern Munich. United, Chelsea and Manchester City are thought to be the title contenders this season and City was the first team to flinch when it lost 3-2 at newly promoted Cardiff on Sunday. ""I told the players before the game we want to win, we will play to win but if you don't win, you don't lose,"" said Mourinho. ""I think the players understood this completely."" The first half Monday never took off. If ever a game needed a goal, as the saying goes, this was it. United striker Robin Van Persie struck the side netting and somehow teammate Antonio Valencia escaped a yellow card from Martin Atkinson when he hacked down Oscar. As the half drew to a close, Rooney almost slipped in van Persie but his pass was too heavy. United began the second half with more urgency and Danny Welbeck -- who scored two goals in United's league opener last week versus Swansea -- should have done better when Rooney found him inside the box. Chelsea's no-striker formation failed to match the potency of the Spanish national team and Torres entered in the 60th minute. United wanted a penalty when it felt Tom Cleverley's shot struck Frank Lampard in the arm but Atkinson didn't budge. ""I think that's two in a week that Chelsea has had ... which have been good shouts,"" Moyes said, referring to an incident in the Villa game last week. Rooney's rising shot in the 77th minute forced Petr Cech into a diving save and from the ensuing corner, Welbeck mistimed his header. Chelsea was by this time happy with a point, further shown when Mourinho replaced Kevin de Bruyne with not Mata but defensive midfielder John Obi Mikel. Three points for Madrid . In Spain, Real Madrid made it two wins from two league games to match Barcelona after beating Granada 1-0 away. Karim Benzema, the French striker linked with Arsenal, accounted for the scoring with a 10th-minute goal. Real Madrid could have added to its lead, but Isco hit the post and Cristiano Ronaldo was denied by keeper Roberto.","Premier League title contenders Manchester United and Chelsea draw 0-0 .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- Four boys were killed Saturday when hurricane-force winds caused a roof to collapse at a sports center outside Barcelona, Spain, authorities said. A police officer inspects the site of the roof collapse Saturday near Barcelona, Spain. Nine people, including two adults, were injured. At least six others in Spain and four in France have died in storms that have socked the region, authorities and Spanish media reported. The sports complex collapsed  shortly after 11 a.m. (5 a.m. ET) in Sant Boi de Llobregat, a suburb just west of the city, near the Prat airport. The boys who died, who were 9 to 12 years old, were among 17 youngsters playing baseball outside when strong winds began blowing. The adults took 11 of the children into the building, authorities told CNN sister network CNN+. The winds caused the metal roof and part of the building's concrete siding to collapse on those inside, said a reporter for CNN+.  Watch rescuers dig through the rubble » . The six boys who stayed outside were not hurt. Earlier official reports that said they had been injured were wrong. Emergency workers thought they had rescued all survivors and recovered all bodies from the building by early afternoon, the CNN+ reporter said. Spanish media have reported winds of up to 99 mph in parts of Catalonia, whose capital is Barcelona. Strong winds have also had much of northern Spain on alert. The winds would signify a Category 2 hurricane, which has wind speeds that range from 96 to 110 mph, according to the Saffir-Simpson scale. The winds toppled garbage containers and other objects in Madrid. Various northern airports had delays, as did high-speed train service between Madrid and Barcelona, authorities said. A Civil Guard officer in northwestern Spain died when a tree fell on him as he tried to clear other fallen trees, and a woman in Barcelona was crushed by a wall that caved in. The severe weather, which began Friday night, has also pummeled southwestern France, knocking out power for about 1.2 million homes, according to Electricite de France. On Saturday, two drivers in the city of Les Landes were killed when heavy winds downed trees that fell on their cars. A 78-year-old man also died after being struck by debris near his home, police said. In Gironde, a 73-year-old woman who was on a respiratory machine died after her home lost power. Regions hit include Pyrenees-Atlantiques, Hautes-Pyrenees, Gers, Haute-Garonne, Gironde, Lot-et-Garonne, Aude and Pyrenees-Orientales, officials said, with fallen trees and damaged roads hindering access.

"(CNN) -- Once again, the Murnaghan family is complete. After six months in the hospital fighting for her life -- during which her parents fought to change national policy on organ donation to save their now 11-year-old daughter's life -- Sarah Murnaghan returned home to Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday. ""She just wanted to be with her brothers and sister,"" her mother, Janet, told reporters. ""I mean, she really just wants to be with her family. It's been hard."" Then again, life has never been easy for young Sarah. She suffers from cystic fibrosis, a disease of the secretory glands that's passed through genes -- even if the parents of the person afflicted don't have it. According to the National Institutes of Health, the disease often affects sufferers' lungs, pancreas, intestines, liver, sinuses and sex organs. In mild cases, a person with cystic fibrosis may not be diagnosed until they are teens or, perhaps, adults. But for others, it can have a debilitating impact. That was the situation with Sarah, who has been in and out of hospitals her entire life. Speaking Tuesday, Janet Murnaghan credited the diagnosis with making her daughter especially tough. ""It's a disease that's really demanding -- ... it takes everything from the minute you're diagnosed until you're at the point where Sarah is at,"" the mother said. 'She's spent her whole life fighting. It's just a different mentality than your average kid."" Even then, the past year has been particularly difficult. Sarah's lungs had deteriorated rapidly -- much faster than anyone in her family expected -- and in May doctors told the family that Sarah had less than five weeks to live. Despite her dire condition, though, Sarah couldn't get a lung transplant. She was the first candidate on the priority list for children in her region. But children's organs rarely become available. In 2012, there were just 10 transplants in Sarah's age group, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. Comparatively, there were more than 1,700 adult transplants in the same year. Her family felt transplanting an adult lung was their best hope. But it wasn't possible: Sarah fell just shy of the requirement that anyone who gets adult lungs must be at least 12 years old. Perhaps taking a cue from their daughter, the Murnaghans fought vigorously to change that stipulation -- and like her, they succeeded. On June 5, a federal judge issued a restraining order to prevent the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from having the agency that oversees transplants apply the policy. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius then directed the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to waive the rule. Even after that move, the Murnaghan family is vowing to keep working so youngsters get every medically sound opportunity available to get transplants. ""Kids on the system have died at three times the rate,"" Janet Murnaghan said. ""So we're not letting go of it."" June happened to be a particularly tough month for the Murnaghan family in many ways: Not only were they initially waiting for a policy change, but Sarah -- then 10 -- was clinging to life. Their dreams appeared to come true that month as well, when she received transplanted lungs -- from an adult . But it didn't take, the family revealed later. For several days, a machine kept Sarah alive. She got another chance in the form of a second lung transplant, which again came from an adult. Speaking more than two months after that happened, Janet Murnaghan said ""the lungs are doing fabulous."" ""She's weaned off the oxygen,"" the mother said. ""But she has the tracheotomy, (which) is helping her breath... They just can't do it by themselves yet."" With her discharge and ambulance ride home from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Sarah is back where she belongs. But it's not like things are all of a sudden easy for her. She still has trouble walking, relying on a walker to move. She will head off to rehab several times a weak. But Sarah will also start school -- from home, initially -- the week of September 9. If all goes well, things will keep on progressing, says her father, Fran Murnaghan, who adds hat the goal is ""getting more back to regular life. ""Each day, she gets stronger,"" he said. ""We'll be doing more and more normal things."" Given all that she's gone through, for Sarah, doing ""normal things"" will be an extraordinary accomplishment.","Sarah Murnaghan has cystic fibrosis; her condition and her lungs deteriorated rapidly .

"(CNN) -- The phenomenal success of ""Modern Family"" has been a game changer for its entire cast, including actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson. The show's high ratings, three consecutive Emmy wins for outstanding comedy series and broad fan base have given all its stars a massive platform. Ferguson is using his for a cause that's both political and personal: the fight to legalize same-sex marriage. The 37-year-old Montana native doesn't just play Mitch, a gay man in a loving, committed relationship on TV; in a way, he is Mitch. After dating for more than two years, Ferguson and his boyfriend, Justin Mikita, decided to take the next step. During a recent trip to Mexico, Ferguson ""popped the big Q."" Mikita said yes. After much consideration and debate, the newly engaged couple decided to go public with their private news, not because they don't enjoy their privacy -- they certainly do -- but because in doing so they knew they could shine a light on a cause dear to their hearts. Ferguson and Mitka started the Tie the Knot foundation. Its mission is simple: sell bow ties to raise money for marriage equality. The ""Modern Family"" actor recently spoke with CNN about his organization. CNN: When you go to www.tietheknot.org, the first thing you see is a hilarious video of you and Justin announcing your engagement. Jesse Tyler Fergusson: I feel like when you tackle any subject with comedy, humor and wits, you're going to get a lot further than if you just give the dry facts of the cause. CNN: It definitely gets your attention. It couldn't have been an easy decision to put your private life out there like that. Ferguson: We kind of felt like the only way to legitimize why we wanted to do this was to announce that we were actually engaged. It made me very nervous; I didn't want to exploit something that was very personal and private between Justin and me. But, in the context of our foundation, it felt like (it was) the right time to tell people. CNN: My favorite part was your struggle with labeling your relationship. Ferguson: I hate ""lover""! I think it sounds so pretentious and like that ""Saturday Night Live"" skit with Will Ferrell and Rachel Dratch in the hot tub eating turkey. I've always found the term fiance in gay or straight relationships to be completely strange. It doesn't sound English or American at all. I love calling Justin ""the lover I've taken on,"" but he doesn't care for that. So I just say ""boyfriend."" I think there's something really sweet and innocent about it. CNN: A lot of boyfriends, and girlfriends in Maine, Maryland and Washington got some good news on Election Day when same-sex marriage was legalized in those states by popular vote. Ferguson: I have such mixed feelings about it. Obviously, I'm so happy these states won marriage equality. It's also very tough for me. I went through it with Proposition 8 (in California), seeing the majority vote on the minority's rights. It's incredibly hard to swallow. I just feel like it shouldn't be up to the majority to vote on a minority's civil rights. I'm thrilled that we are slowly making progress, and we have to make progress however we can. But I do look forward to the day we stop putting it in the hands of the states and make it a national thing. This is America and (marriage equality) should be part of the ""United"" part of our country. CNN: What do you see as the biggest challenge between where things are now and the protection of same-sex marriage under federal law? Ferguson: We're in a great place. There's a forward movement on this issue, and for many young Americans it's a nonissue. But one stumbling block is the lack of education about marriage equality. I feel like there's a fear that the definition of marriage will be changed. Nobody's looking to change the meaning of what it means to be married. We just want to add to who has the right. It's the same thing as women wanting the right to vote. They weren't going to change the meaning of going to the polls and putting the card in the ballot; they just wanted the right to vote. CNN: And whether you're voting or getting married, who doesn't like to wear a nice bow tie, right? Why did you pick this accessory as the cornerstone of your foundation? Ferguson: I selfishly wanted to get involved in the fashion world anyway, but in a way that didn't feel like a huge undertaking. So I thought about what I like to wear and also what is literally the smallest piece of clothing I could possibly design. So we came up with the bow-tie line. It was Justin's idea to incorporate it into the foundation. We thought -- why don't we kill two birds with one stone? We'll start a bow-tie line and funnel the proceeds into a foundation for marriage equality. Then Justin came up with the idea of Tie the Knot, which just perfectly marries those two ideas. CNN: I think people will appreciate the symbolism. Also, it matches your character in ""Modern Family."" I imagine your cast mates have been supportive. The chemistry there really seems to go beyond the set. Is that the case? Ferguson: I mean it really is. People are always trying to test us and break us and find out the darkness, but there's really nothing to tell. We're kind of on this roller coaster together, and it's a very bonding experience. We're watching our families grow. I've gotten engaged since meeting these people. Ty (Burell) has had two kids. Julie (Bowen) had twins. Sofia (Vergara) got engaged. We'll go to a birthday party or get together at someone's house and bring our husbands, wives, fiances, boyfriends and girlfriends, and it feels like a huge extended family. CNN: I bet when one of your family members finds themselves at the center of a crazy headline or serious crisis you all react. Do you turn into Papa Bear? Ferguson: There's obviously some sense of protection because we know being (in) the media's eye how vulnerable that can be when you're going through something. So we all rally around one another and protect one another. We're always checking in with one another, and some walls definitely go up to protect some people. It's exactly what you would expect from people who have your back. CNN: I can only imagine what a ""Modern Family"" gay wedding will be like. I bet you and Justin get asked a lot when the big day is. Ferguson: About once a day! We're in the process of planning it. It could be as early as this spring, and it could be the following spring. We're kind of waiting for some pieces to fall into place and to see what my work schedule is like next summer. I'm also really excited to be married. I don't want to have a three-year engagement. I proposed to Justin because I wanted to be married. I don't want to be a professional engaged person. CNN: Are you planning something more traditional or, dare I say, modern? Ferguson: Well, we're not going to be redefining the marriage ceremony. I grew up Catholic but don't practice any longer. I haven't been to the Catholic Church in years so I would feel really weird to try and bring in those traditions -- it's just not us. It's going to be a very nontraditional, very organic, very simple ceremony. We're not going to have a wedding party or try to find someone amazing to officiate. I think it will be a very short, very sweet and simple and hopefully beautiful ceremony. I don't even have any gay friends who have gotten married, but several of my straight friends had very untraditional weddings, and those have always been my favorite. CNN: Have you decided about starting a family? Ferguson: It's something we've talked about. It's one of those early date questions. ""Do you want kids?"" And we both do. But I'm just excited to get married and sit in the marriage place for a little while. I don't want to jump into kids right away. But, yeah, we both really want kids very much.","Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Justin Mikita launched Tie the Knot foundation .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistan government minister has personally offered a $100,000 reward for anyone who kills the man who made the anti-Islam movie that is drawing ire throughout the Muslim world. Railway Minister Ghulam Ahmad Bilour announced the bounty at a news conference Saturday, but he made clear to CNN he was speaking for himself and not as a government representative. Asked whether he was concerned about committing or condoning a crime as a government official, Bilour said, ""I am a Muslim first, then a government representative.""

How could we make such announcements?"" Khan said. ""Our party has been fighting against militancy and extremism for years. How could we invite Taliban and al Qaeda to kill someone? Taliban and al Qaeda are our enemies who have killed our loved ones."" ""We have lots of concerns over the statement of our colleague,"" he added.

"London (CNN) -- Brazil stands at a crossroads in its efforts to preserve the Amazon rainforest as the government considers controversial legislation governing land use. For most of the past decade, it has made a dramatic reduction in the rate of deforestation, providing a model of how it could be tackled in other rainforest areas such as Indonesia and Congo. The Amazon rainforest covers a huge area, roughly half as large as the United States, with about 60% of it in Brazil. It is estimated that nearly a fifth of the Brazilian forest has been lost since 1970; figures from Brazil's space research institute, INPE, show that 4.1 million square kilometers (1.58 million square miles) of Brazilian forest were still standing in 1970, compared with 3.35 million square kilometers (1.29 million square miles) today. Like in many developing nations, there is pressure on the natural environment from commercial and agriculture interests. According to INPE, in 1995, nearly 30,000 square kilometers (about 11,550 square miles) were cleared -- that is an area about the size of Belgium or the U.S. state of Maryland -- but in 2011, the rate of loss had been reduced to just over 6,000 square kilometers (about 2,400 square miles). Last year saw the lowest annual clearance since yearly INPE surveys began in 1988, and Brazil is aiming to reduce deforestation even further to 3,500 square kilometers annually by 2020. See interactive maps of Brazil's land use . Brazil's environment ministry credits its success to a combination of support for sustainable activities and near-real-time satellite monitoring of forest regions that allows it to target illegal operations with extra agents. But environmentalists worry that these results, brought about by efficient use of technology allied with a political will to slow clearing, could now be put at risk by an overhaul of Brazil's Forest Code. Protesters say the new code, which could come into effect after a crucial vote Tuesday, reduces protection and weakens enforcement laws. ""The changes in the new Forest Code will reduce this protection. Combined with the strong presence of 'ruralists' in the Congress -- congressmen linked to the agri-business sector -- there is good reason to be very concerned for the future of forests in Brazil,"" said Jessica Miller of Greenpeace Brazil. ""Deforestation in the Amazon has many drivers. Loggers come first to take the most precious timber and finance the building of rough, illegal roads. Then come cattle ranchers, burning what is left and planting grass. Cattle ranching is often used to guarantee the ownership of the area by land grabbers,"" she said. At present, Brazilian government statistics show that about 30% of the country's land is given over to agriculture. The power of the rural lobby is acknowledged by those close to the Brazilian government, but the environmental fears are also rejected. Luis Antonio Carvalho, special adviser to the Brazilian environment minister, Izabella Teixeira, said, ""It is true that the rural caucus representatives have much power; everybody knows that. Much of the GDP comes from the Brazilian agriculture and livestock. It is a sector of great importance for the country. ""The new proposal includes all the government's requirements. It sets out regulations to restore the land. It includes components such as social interest, public utilities and low environmental impact. ""But I think this is the best proposal that can come out for both sides. Environmental groups are concerned, but the rural caucus, on the other hand, are worried, too. So it is clear that neither side will be satisfied with any code that the government approves."" Carvalho said farmers must keep 80% of their forested land -- they will be able to clear only 20% -- and may have to use some of their land for reforestation. But farmers are worried about the future of their businesses and are keen to modernize the existing code, which dates to 1965. No one from the Brazilian farmers' body, the CNA, which represents 2,300 rural trade unions, was available for comment, but the group's website calls for a balanced approach that safeguards conservation and food production ""because this production depends on the welfare and progress of the Brazilians."" Protecting the rainforest has attracted celebrity backing for more than two decades. Pop singer Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, set up the Rainforest Foundation in 1989 after seeing the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and its impact on indigenous peoples. Both the Rainforest Foundation and Greenpeace have urged Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff to use her veto to block the law change. They are concerned about the threat to the huge range of animals and plants found in the world's rainforests: Scientists from the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity estimate that at least two-thirds of all Earth's terrestrial species are found in tropical forests. Spring 2012 also marks a significant junction half a world away in Indonesia, which has significant forest areas. In May 2010, Norway signed a letter of intent pledging about $1 billion to help Indonesia reduce deforestation. But there have been delays in implementing the plan, and Greenpeace says it is not working. The agreement was designed to help Indonesia with its commitment to the U.N.'s global REDD+ program (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). It called for the establishment of an ""independent institution for a national monitoring, reporting and verification system,"" a two-year moratorium on all new concessions for forest clearance and enforcement of laws on illegal logging. Rainforest home to vast treasury of life . Central Kalimantan, an area of Indonesia that has seen widespread forest destruction, was chosen as a pilot project. Studies by South Dakota State University and the environmental think tank World Resources Institute show that the lowlands of Kalimantan and Sumatra have lost more than 40% of the rainforest cover since 1990. In the same period, more than 17% of Indonesia's total forest area has disappeared. The studies also show that there has been a resurgence in clearing since 2000, but it has not reached the levels of the 1990s. Attempts to halt deforestation in Indonesia are much less advanced than in Brazil, which started its drive in the 1980s. Greenpeace says there are major loopholes in the Indonesian moratorium, saying the safeguards are inadequate with no review of existing concessions, and criticizes the lack of a good monitoring system. ""In short, in our opinion and analysis, the moratorium has not been working well in halting deforestation in Indonesia,"" said Yuyun Indradi, Greenpeace forest campaigner in Indonesia. ""The land rights issues are also a major problem in forest governance ... creating more and more conflict and human rights violations. It means the existence of indigenous peoples and local peoples are at risk as, currently, the government tends to give more priority to the large scale industries of forestry, plantation and mining,"" he said. The Indonesian government insists that it is committed to REDD+ and introducing a host of measures to slow deforestation and reduce emissions. In a keynote environment speech in September, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono dedicated his remaining three years in office to enhancing the forests of Indonesia. ""We must attain both development and the management of our forest simultaneously,"" he said. ""This is because forest management is tightly intertwined with the livelihood of our people, with our food security, with the availability of wood and fuel. ""Apart from the moratorium, we have built indicative maps that are important to the implementation of REDD+. These maps will also facilitate the resolution of decades-long problems of land use and land tenure."" A spokesman for the Indonesian government adds that it is working on the maps and new concessions permits, and to determine the extent of forest damage and how to control it. But can Indonesia match the progress made by Brazil? Greenpeace's Indradi says Brazil's strong point has been to implement better forest governance, backed up with good monitoring and serious law enforcement. It is the monitoring issue that is also acknowledged as key by the World Resources Institute. ""Reliable monitoring and information are essential for protecting forests,"" said the institute's Fred Stolle. ""Indonesia recognizes the value of good data and is working to develop such a system. ""What the world really needs is consistent, real-time deforestation data for all forested countries."" Sofia Fernandes contributed to this report.","Brazil has made a dramatic reduction in the rate of deforestation .

"(CNN) -- The patient slammed his fist on the table in Dr. Otis Brawley's office. ""Dammit, I'm American,"" Brawley remembers him saying. ""You can't tell me I have prostate cancer and that we're just going to 'watch it.'"" Brawley is the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, a world-renowned cancer expert and practicing oncologist. If you're going to get someone's opinion on a cancer diagnosis or course of treatment, he's a good choice. And in this case, he was recommending no treatment. It's a scenario that may happen more as science reveals cancer's secrets, the biggest one being that what we now call cancer maybe shouldn't be called cancer at all. ""The word 'cancer' often invokes the specter of an inexorably lethal process,"" a working group for the National Cancer Institute wrote in a recent recommendation. ""However, cancers are heterogeneous and can follow multiple paths, not all of which progress to metastases and death."" Basically, cancer is scary, but some kinds may be more boogeyman-in-the-closet scary than serial killer scary. To understand fully, you have to look at the history of cancer diagnosis, Brawley says. In the 1850s, a group of German pathologists did some of the first biopsies on people who had clearly died of cancer. They took samples of their tumors and decided what breast cancer looks like, what lung cancer looks like, etc. Today, Brawley says, there is a patient who has a lesion that's approximately 5 millimeters in diameter -- smaller than a pea. There's a doctor taking a biopsy of that lesion and a pathologist who's analyzing the sample using 21st-century technology. The problem, Brawley says, is that they're still comparing the samples to the cancer definition that was created more than 150 years ago. ""He's going, 'This looks just like what those Germans said is breast cancer,' "" Brawley said of the pathologist. ""But it's 5 millimeters in size. What killed the woman 160 years ago had spread all throughout her body."" We all harbor abnormalities, says H. Gilbert Welch, Dartmouth professor of medicine and author of the book ""Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health."" And new technology is increasingly able to find these abnormalities. When we do, our inclination is to act, even when the remedy turns out to be far more harmful than the disease would have been, had it run its course. There is a growing consensus, backed by mounting scientific evidence, that Americans tend to be overtested, overdiagnosed and overtreated across a variety of conditions. Some experts estimate that unnecessary interventions account for 10% to 30% of U.S. health care spending. Part of the problem is our medical culture, Welch says. The physician may be engaging in what is known as ""defensive medicine,"" which entails ordering tests to guard against malpractice suits, should something go awry. There may also be perverse economic incentives at play -- that is, in a fee-for-service system, doctors are compensated for the quantity of tests and procedures they order. But a recent study of physicians with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs found that salaried physicians who received no income from an increased volume of services and who had limited liability concerns ordered as many heart stress tests deemed ""unnecessary"" as doctors in more traditional settings. The researchers theorized that the doctors had ""an exaggerated perception of benefit"" of the tests. In an editor's note on the study, Dr. Deborah Grady observed that while the study sample was small, ""neverthless, it suggests that the culture of overdoing is ingrained."" Simply put, physicians are trained to think that the way you take care of people is to ""find stuff and to take care of that stuff,"" Welch says. Patients aren't exactly helping the issue, either. Energized by public awareness cancer campaigns, many patients have been empowered to find cancer early through screening and to intervene as soon as possible, Welch observes. ""To raise awareness and to get people to participate in screening, we have to whip up fear; we must introduce a bit of 'dis-ease' into the population,"" he said. ""In a way, we have to make them feel as if the world may be a more dangerous place and that they ought to be worried about their future."" Brawley's patient, the one he refused to treat, eventually found another doctor who would treat his prostate cancer. ""Patients will doctor-shop until they get what they want,"" Brawley said. It's an issue many people have difficulty wrapping their heads around: Some patients who are diagnosed with cancer do not need to be treated, because that cancer is never going to bother them. The problem is that we don't know who those people are. ""There is a lot of work and research in this area in trying to better characterize which tumors will matter,"" Welch said. The National Cancer Institute working group made several recommendations for the medical community in addressing cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment. One was a change in the terminology doctors use to talk about cancer, especially when the cells they've found may not be dangerous. ""Use of the term 'cancer' should be reserved for describing lesions with a reasonable likelihood of lethal progression if left untreated,"" they wrote. They also noted that the public should be made aware that overdiagnosis is common in cancer screening. Doctors know that approximately 10% of localized lung cancer tumors and 20% to 30% of localized breast cancer tumors that are found through screening would never cause harm, Brawley says. ""That tumor would just stay there: never grow, never spread."" The rate is even higher for prostate cancer at 60%. But isn't screening used to catch some aggressive cancers in people that we would otherwise see too late to treat? Some overdiagnosis is acceptable, Brawley says. ""We cure and treat some people who don't need to be treated. And in return, we save some lives."" But screening has its own dangers. Whenever you test a population, you will have some false positives. For example, if a woman is told that her mammogram is abnormal, that diagnosis might be straightened out days or weeks later, and she might find out that she does not have cancer. The diagnosis will create anxiety and lead to additional unnecessary testing. Good health is more than absence of physical abnormality; it's also a state of mind, experts say. ""In my experience, it's not the diagnosis of cancer which really kills people,"" said Ezekiel Emanuel, a former oncologist, vice provost for global initiatives and chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. ""It's the uncertainty."" The National Cancer Institute group recommended reducing the frequency of some screening examinations, focusing that screening on high-risk groups (e.g. screening smokers for lung cancer) and raising the requirements that would lead to a biopsy or other follow up care. ""We've been taught that cancer is a terrible thing and the way to deal with it always is to find it early and cut it out,"" Brawley said. ""We're starting to realize that that is not true in all cases."" Childhood cancer survivors have significant chronic disease .","National Cancer Institute scientists say the word ""cancer"" is sometimes misleading .
Not everyone who is diagnosed with cancer should be treated, experts say .
Unnecessary tests and treatment may account for 10% to 30% of health care spending ."

But if a sampling of public sentiment Wednesday morning is any indication, the rest of New York doesn't seem to be so sure the former congressman should continue his quest to become the city's next mayor. ""Wow, this guy is such a ... I don't want to use any bad words,"" New Yorker Eric Patel said Wednesday. ""But how can you repeatedly do this thing, and he has no shame. And he's like, 'Oh, I'm still running for mayor after all this.'"" Weiner said Tuesday that he would remain in the mayoral race despite the emergence of new lewd text messages and photos, including some sent after he was forced to resign from Congress in 2011 after the emergence of similar messages -- which he at first said were placed on his account by Internet hackers. Calls for 'Carlos Danger' to withdraw pour in . His wife, Huma Abedin, stood by him at a news conference Tuesday responding to the scandal. ""We discussed all of this before he decided to run for mayor, so really what I want to say is, I love him, I have forgiven him, I believe in him, and as we have said from the beginning, we are moving forward,"" she said. Huma Abedin, a Hillary Clinton adviser, emerges from privacy to spotlight . To be sure, Weiner still has his supporters. ""Stay STRONG, hang in there, we got your back like you've had ours all these years!!!"" Facebook user Linda Flores posted on Weiner's Facebook page. ""So he is a pervert ... who cares,"" another supporter, Vince Tricoli, wrote on the page. ""Why is his marriage our business? Am I missing something?"" Twitter user jaclynf12h wrote. But such sentiments are harder and harder to find among the endless stream of critical messages on social media that frequently crack wise at Weiner's expense. ""Damn son, are you OK in the head? You wanna be an anonymous pervert you gotta stop running for office"" Facebook user David Gibson said on Weiner's page. Twitter user LOD19m, wrote, ""When I try to picture Anthony Weiner presiding over a disaster like 9/11 or Sandy, all I see is a man in an NYPD windbreaker and no pants."" As news of the lewd messages spreads, Weiner is under increasing pressure to drop out -- including from New York newspaper editorial boards and other candidates. A New York Times/Siena College poll last week placed him second among candidates for the Democratic nomination. And despite his pleas Tuesday for another chance, New Yorkers appear increasingly unwilling to forgive or forget.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- ""I was a walking time bomb. I knew I had to get on that plane if I wanted to be around to see my grandkids."" Sandra Giustina is rolled into surgery to correct her atrial fibrillation at Max Hospital in New Dehli, India. Sandra Giustina is a 61-year-old uninsured American. For three years she saved her money in hopes of affording heart surgery to correct her atrial fibrillation. ""They [U.S. hospitals] told me it would be about $175,000, and there was just no way could I come up with that,"" Giustina said. So, with a little digging online, she found several high quality hospitals vying for her business, at a fraction of the U.S. cost. Within a month, she was on a plane from her home in Las Vegas, Nevada, to New Delhi, India. Surgeons at Max Hospital fixed her heart for ""under $10,000 total, including travel."" Giustina is just one of millions around the world journeying outside their native land for medical treatment, a phenomenon known as ""medical tourism."" Experts say the trend in global health care has just begun. Next year alone, an estimated 6 million Americans will travel abroad for surgery, according to a 2008 Deloitte study. ""Medical care in countries such as India, Thailand and Singapore can cost as little as 10 percent of the cost of comparable care in the United States,"" the report found. Companies such as Los Angeles-based Planet Hospital are creating a niche in the service industry as medical travel planners. One guidebook says that more than 200 have sprung up in the last few years. ""We find the best possible surgeons and deliver their service to patients safely, affordably and immediately,"" said Rudy Rupak, president of Planet Hospital. ""No one should have to choose between an operation to save their life or going bankrupt."" Planet Hospital, which works with international clients as well as Americans, books patients' travel and arranges phone interviews with potential surgeons. Patients are greeted by a company representative at the airport in the country where they've chosen to be treated; a 24-hour personal ""patient concierge"" is also provided, a level of service that's standard among many of the top medical travel planning companies.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta meet some medical tourists » . ""Our patient concierge was amazing,"" said Giustina. ""He came to the hospital every day, gave us his personal [telephone] number and after my operation, he arranged private tours of India."" Just two days post-op, Giustina and her husband, Dino, toured local markets and landmarks including the Presidential Palace and the Taj Mahal. ""I was able to fix my heart and tour India, which is something I thought I'd never do."" Walk through a patient wing at Max Hospital in New Delhi on any given day and you're likely to see people from around the world. In one visit, CNN met patients from the United Kingdom, Nigeria, Jordan, Afghanistan and the United States. They're alike in choosing surgery abroad, but their reasons differ. Many South Asians and Africans said they travel abroad because they do not have access to care in their homeland. Some Canadians and Europeans said they chose to travel aboard, despite having national health plans, because they are tired of waiting -- sometimes years -- for treatment. Patients from the Middle East said they come to India because the technology as well as the staff is more advanced. For most Americans CNN spoke to, it came down to finding the best value. ""If I could have afforded my procedure in the United States, I would have taken it, but that was not my option,"" Giustina said. ""I had to get online and look for a Plan B."" Read about hot destinations for medical tourism . The private hospitals in India market themselves as having upscale accommodations, Western-trained surgeons and state-of-the-art medical equipment. CNN spent time at Max Healthcare in New Delhi and saw operating rooms similar to those in many U.S. hospitals. If fact, Max's neurosurgery room had an inter-operative MRI scanner, which is technology hardly seen at hospitals in the United States. The lobby had marble floors, a book café, coffee station and a Subway sandwich shop. The patient suites were equipped with flat screen TVs, DVD players and Wi-Fi. This hospital also catered to families traveling together. The suites had adjoining rooms with a kitchenette, coffee maker and a sofa bed. Max neurosurgeon Dr. Ajaya Jha said the hospital can provide high-quality care at low prices because the staff work hard to cut waste.  Watch Dr. Gupta visit an Indian spice market » . ""I've seen hospitals in the U.S. where they open up something costing $10,000 and say, 'Oh it's not working. OK, give me another one.' We would never do that here. Even for 100 rupees (about $2) -- we would say, ""Do we need to open this suture? Do we need to open this gauze?' We are very conscious of cost."" Hospital officials negotiate hard to keep costs low for high-tech medical machinery and other supplies, Jha said. ""In the U.S. people are making careers out of carrying laptops and documenting things that are not really useful in the long term for the patient."" The salary of a U.S. surgeon is five times that of a surgeon in India. ""We [surgeons in India] want to make a profit, but we don't want to profiteer. We don't want squeeze people and I think American industries should also think that way,"" Jha said. Critics of medical tourism warn patients to be diligent when researching treatment aboard. ""I've found that industry voices tend to crowd out those of us who are more cautious about the legal risks,"" said Nathan Cortez, assistant law professor at Southern Methodist University, who is conducting a case study investigating what legal recourse patients have outside America. Patients don't think about their legal vulnerabilities, Cortez said. ""Some countries limit patient access to medical records so they can't really learn what happened during the surgery. And a lot of practitioners in other countries just refuse to give you your medical records. So people have to weigh the risk versus benefits."" While most tourism patients from America are uninsured, major U.S. insurance companies are considering providing ""medical tourism"" coverage to their customers. Several have already launched pilot programs. ""I think what's really important about medical tourism is that you make the choice for what's right for you and what's important to them,"" said a spokesman for U.S. health insurer WellPoint Inc. Experts say that every patient considering traveling abroad for surgery should inquire about postoperative care, legal rights and the safety standards and certifications of the hospital. Foreign health care providers should be willing to discuss the procedure and answer question ahead of time. ""What really helped me feel good about the process was that my doctor in the U.S. spoke to the cardiologist in India prior to my trip,"" said Giustina. ""They were so open about everything; I knew I'd be in good hands."" Just weeks from returning from abroad, Giustina says she has only one regret, ""I shouldn't have waited so long! I feel like a new person again, no more pain.""","Study: More than 6 million from U.S. will travel abroad for treatment in the next year .

"(CNN) -- Game 7 of the NBA Finals will be all about heart, Miami Heat superstar LeBron James said. The four-time MVP is seeking his second NBA crown when his Heat hosts the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday night. Both teams are well-prepared, he said, and they know each other well. They know what will work on offense, what to do on defense. What gives a team an edge will be each player's mental makeup. ""I think it's about heart and determination at this point,"" he said Wednesday. James sparked the Heat to a comeback win in Game 6, hitting a key 3-pointer in the final 20 seconds of regulation. He had a triple-double -- 32 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds -- as the Heat won 103-100 in an overtime game many commentators have called one of the best NBA playoff games ever. In the last game, the Heat took off after James took off his signature headband. But when the final game of the season starts, James will be wearing it. ""He has been a part of this journey, the ups and downs of my career so far, so we'll see what happens."" he said. James became not only a different looking man down the stretch, he became a different player. ""He was about doing whatever it took,"" Heat guard Dwyane Wade said. ""And I'm sure we get in that moment again, he's going to do whatever it takes again."" The Spurs may have been deflated by giving away a 10-point fourth-quarter lead, but rebounded emotionally, thanks to an unusual early morning team dinner after the game, which ended after 11 p.m. Star center Tim Duncan said instead of each player going back to his hotel room and ordering room service and beating himself up, the team went out. It helped to talk things out. ""It's always good to be around teammates and kind of get some stuff out in the open. We did exactly that,"" he said. Early in the season, the Spurs sent Duncan and three other players back to San Antonio for rest instead of to a contest in Miami that ended a six-game road trip. The Spurs were fined $250,000. There were no fatigued Spurs on Wednesday, he said, after a season of more than 100 games over nine months. ""We're not tired in any way,"" said the 37-year-old Duncan, who played 44 minutes on Tuesday. ""There's no being tired at this point. We've got one more game to win, and that's all that matters."" For James, if the Heat don't win, it's a season down the drain. After all, he said he left the Cleveland Cavaliers three years ago and joined Wade with the Heat for one reason -- to win championships. Winning his first crown last year was hard, he said. But this year has been harder. He told reporters Wednesday he would be antsy and nervous before Game 7, but that's how it should be. ""The moment is going to be grand. ... I'm happy to be a part of it."" CNN's Rachel Nichols contributed to this report.","""It's about heart and determination at this point,"" LeBron James says .

"Melbourne (CNN) -- The curious timing of North Korea's Unha-3 rocket launch, outside of its usual spring-summer launch window, raises questions about the political motivations behind Pyongyang's attention-grabbing move. On Wednesday morning, just before 10 a.m. local time, South Korean news agency Yonhap and the Japanese government reported that the rocket had been launched. It came just days after North Korea extended the launch window due to technical issues. Read more: North Korea rocket breaks up in flight . Taking heed of launch and the usual caveats about reading North Korean government behavior, we can discern three motives underlying Pyongyang's latest move: international bargaining, domestic legitimacy and strategic leverage. This year, Northeast Asia is experiencing a unique convergence of elections and leadership transitions in the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. This follows the change of leadership in North Korea in December 2011. Read more: Photos of North Korea's newest rocket . With Barack Obama's re-election in Washington and Xi Jinping named as the new Chinese President, the region awaits the outcomes of the Japanese election on December 16 and the South Korean presidential poll on December 19. Proliferation-related negotiating activity is on hold, leaving a diplomatic vacuum until the new governments are settled. While North Korea appears to have no intention of relinquishing its nuclear or missile capabilities, its habitual tactic of engineering crises to leverage aid from the international community in exchange for de-escalation or proliferation freeze agreements is predicated on negotiations actually taking place. Read more: The limits of North Korea's media openness . External aid fills gaps in the domestic economy and satisfies vital needs such as food and energy that the regime cannot provide for indigenously. The gambit fails if there are no negotiations. A December rocket launch sends a strong signal from Pyongyang to its regional interlocutors to ensure that North Korea does not get overlooked amid the bureaucratic maelstrom that usually follows changes in government. It will test the resolve of the new leadership teams and yield clues as to how they are likely to react individually and coordinate together in relation to North Korea in future. Read more: One week in North Korea . Whichever candidate wins the election in Seoul is likely to move away from Lee Myung-bak's disastrous ""reciprocity"" policy toward greater engagement with Pyongyang. Japan is likely to adopt a more hawkish approach to North Korea if the Liberal Democratic Party wins the election, as polls currently suggest. How North Korea fits within the Sino-American relationship will also be of interest to Pyongyang, with Xi Jinping and his new Politburo Standing Committee at the helm in Beijing. A successful rocket launch would also represent a sterling commemoration of the first anniversary of Kim Jong Il's death on December 17, much as the unsuccessful April launch was intended for propaganda purposes as a celebration of Kim Il Sung's centenary. By demonstrating technological prowess, it would legitimize the regime's ""strong and prosperous country"" rhetoric and bestow prestige on North Korea's young new ruler, Kim Jong Un. Similarly, Washington's prickly reactions to Pyongyang's provocations play into the Kim regime's anti-imperialist ideology, the staple of its propaganda output. Read more: Witness to the cult of North Korea's Kim dynasty . Kim Jong Un's domestic legitimacy will grow if Pyongyang proceeds with tentative and embryonic economic reforms hinted at during the past year -- the 6.28 policy --in North Korea's agricultural sector. Any economic reform program in North Korea risks creating new socio-economic cleavages -- grassroots entrepreneurialism and linkages to the global economy could foster powerful domestic actors who may develop interests that differ to those of the ruling regime. For Kim Jong Un, legitimacy and prestige will be paramount if his government chooses to walk the path of economic adjustments. One should also not discount the strategic motivations for the timing of the launch. In the past year South Korea has announced its deployment of cruise missiles with a range of 1,000 kilometers, capable of hitting targets anywhere in North Korea, along with tactical ballistic missiles and drones with a range of 300 kilometers. It's no stretch to interpret North Korea's rocket launch in terms of a classic arms race, as a missile test in response to its adversary's upgraded missile systems. The demonstration of a viable long-range rocket will add another piece to North Korea's nuclear deterrence posture. Pyongyang has yet to master long-range, multi-stage missile technology, despite a long developmental phase punctuated by a number of unsuccessful tests. A successful launch may herald a movement from the developmental phase of the long-range missile program closer to deployment. This would increase Pyongyang's strategic and diplomatic leverage in relation to its northeast Asian neighbors and its ability to use this event as a bargaining chip to extract further aid from the international community. Foreign policy decisions are generally arise from a mixture of motivations. The unique confluence of leadership transitions across the region in late 2012 coincides with a North Korean state at an interesting point in its evolution. North Korea's rocket launch suggests important clues about the manner in which Kim Jong Un and his government are attempting to navigate the swirling regional, strategic and domestic currents.","Report: North Korea launches long-range rocket Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Aisha Tyler is not your typical comedian. The 42-year-old is a 6 foot tall woman who snowboards, camps, raps about her lack of a rear end, and can't dance. ""I will never be the lead in Step it Up 17: Old lady gets to Krumpin',"" she writes in her new book. ""I have made my peace with this."" While she might lack rhythm, the Dartmouth grad speaks fluent French, with some functionality in Russian and Swahili. Tyler was the first black recurring character on Friends, has filled in for the late movie critic Roger Ebert and taken on gamers who questioned her nerd status. A few funny things happened on the way to the native San Franciscan finding success as Lana Kane in the edgy animated FX series ""Archer,"" and hosting ""The Talk"", and the CW's ""Who's Line is It Anyway?"". She (regrettably) wore two-toned hair and a see-through dress on the red carpet, survived throwing up on a guy during their first date, and bombed countless times on stage. In ""Self-Inflicted Wounds,"" her second book, Tyler argues that the path to success is paved with epic failures. And she's not afraid to share her own hard-luck stories for a laugh or to show that fear of striking out should never keep you from swinging for the fences. CNN recently caught up with the host of the podcast ""Girl on Guy,"" which inspired the book, out now. The edited conversation is below. CNN: How did an Ivy League grad, with a degree in political science and environmental studies, become interested in comedy? Tyler: Well, I think I was always interested in comedy. I was always a very, kind of, fiction-obsessed kid, and a big reader, and just loved make-believe. And then in high school I started to do improv, and sketch comedy, and did that all the way through college. I was always interested in performing ... I just came from a really academically driven family. I was really focused on school, so it just never seemed like a real job to me. And so after I got my degree in government and environmental studies, I thought, ""Well, now I have a degree and I can take a risk and see if it will pay off because I can always go back to a traditional job."" CNN: Throughout the book, you share stories of your self-inflicted wounds. In some way it is an anti-self-help book, showing how failure can help in your success. Why write about the failures? Tyler: I always tell people that success is not the absence of failure, success is persistence through failure. So it does show how failure can help. I mean I think there are a lot of people who are crippled by a failure. Crippled by something that goes wrong in their lives. And we're crippled by a fear of failure. And the people who say, who say, you know ""I don't want to try this. I would like to be a comedian, but I'm afraid I'm going to fail. I want to write a book, but I'm afraid I'm going to fail."" And well I say, ""You are. You are going to fail. There's no doubt about it that something's going to go terribly wrong."" An indivisible aspect of being alive, of being human, of being on this planet, and if you're not failing, you're not innovating. If you're not failing, you're not risking. So go for it, and then use the failure as a fuel, use it as a way to become mentally tough because it's absolutely unavoidable. CNN: What is it that you want people to most understand about you? Tyler: That I'm not trying to live up to anybody else's expectations of who I am. I'm going to, not that I'm striving consciously to be an iconoclast, but I'm definitely also not striving to meet some set parameters either as an actress, or a comedian, or an artist, or anything. I'm just trying to do what I find compelling. CNN: What would you tell your younger self about who you are now? Tyler: I would probably tell my younger self, ""Don't worry about it. You're always going to be a weirdo, and at some point that's going to be OK. That's eventually going to be your calling card, or your badge of courage, that you're going to be a weird kid."" I mean even now, when I stand on stage, earlier in my career anyway, when people didn't know I did stand-up, I would get up on stage and I would be a 6-foot-tall black woman, people had very specific expectations about what was going to come out of my mouth. And I've never ever been able to satisfy those expectations, and I realized very early on that I wasn't going to change who I was to fulfill a set of expectations that people had about me. And I just plowed ahead until my audience found me. So I never stopped being a weird kid. Just that I found weird people who liked what I did. CNN: How has being different shaped your journey? Tyler: I hated when I was a kid being told that, ""Black people don't do that."" And the white kids at school didn't accept me because I was black, and the black kids in my neighborhood didn't accept me because they thought I thought I was white. So that was fine. I was in a no-man's land. And that meant I just got to do what I thought was interesting. And that's just who I've been since then. And it's guided all of my decisions, which is I have never stopped to think, ""Oh, you know, does this fit?"" I just do what I want to do. CNN: What do you believe in? Tyler: I believe in hard work. I think that everything flows out of that. It doesn't mean that you're going to be successful, or traditionally successful because sometimes the world is just unfair, and untalented people get promoted and talented people get left behind, but if you are doing something that you love and you put a lot of hard work into it, you will be rewarded, and that's been the thing I've hewn to for my entire adult life. CNN: Anything else? Tyler: You can't control where you were born, the family you were born into, what you look like, you can't control any of those circumstances, the only thing you can control is how you react. So for my entire life that's been the rule that has governed my decisions. I can't control what's fair and unfair, I can't control the nature of the business, or the nature of society, or the nature of the world, but what I can control is how I choose to see the world and what I choose to put back into it.","Comedian Aisha Tyler jokes about her biggest embarrassments in her new book .

"(CNN) -- A riot on a tiny island in the Pacific that killed no one would usually go unnoticed by the world. But when some 100 asylum seekers burned down their shelters in an Australian refugee processing center Friday on Nauru Island, it did not. Instead, it drew attention to a new restrictive law made in Australia the same day banning ""boat people"" from living in the country. ""As of today asylum seekers who come here by boat without a visa will never be settled in Australia,"" said Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in a statement announcing the law. The asylum seekers did not revolt because of the new law, an immigration spokeswoman said. They may have not even known about it when the mayhem broke out. They are stuck on the island without papers for Australia. The United Nations has called the conditions on Nauru ""unbearable,"" noting that asylum seekers have been gone on hunger strike before because of them. Their alternatives: Go back to where they came from, places such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Iran, or wait in limbo on a lonely island. The unrest began as peaceful demonstrations earlier in the week, but then things got out of hand, the spokeswoman said. The new law will put more people in their position -- marooned on an island with little choice of where to go next. On Saturday, Australian authorities intercepted the first boat smuggling refugees since the law was passed. It was sailing near the Christmas Islands and was crammed full with 81 people, who will face that fate. Starting immediately, all ""boat people"" will be taken to the sparsely populated jungle island of Manus, which is a part of Papua New Guinea. Australian officials Sunday said 15 Vietnamese asylum seekers on Manus were returned home. Middle of nowhere . Nauru Island, where the insurrection broke out, is the epitome of the middle of nowhere. It is roughly 2,000 miles from Australia's shores, where Rudd said in no uncertain terms that ""boat people"" are no longer to tread. There is not much room to roam on Nauru. It is just three miles across at its widest point. And there are not many people to talk to. The nearly 600 ""transferees,"" as they are called, make up 5% of the island's total population. And they speak various languages from Farsi to Pashtun. More than 150 miles of open ocean separate them from their nearest neighbor, which is another tiny island. One-way street . Manus presents a similar situation. People arriving there will have to wait for authorities to determine that they are true refugees, not just people seeking a better life in a richer country. ""If they're found to be genuine refugees, they will be resettled in Papua New Guinea,"" Rudd said. Rudd described the country in optimistic terms as ""an emerging economy with a strong future."" Those who settle there may find it to be more of a jungle island populated with mostly native peoples, as the CIA World Factbook says. Not much of a replacement for the immigration melting pot they had hoped for. Australia is prepared for an unlimited influx of new asylum seekers to the neighboring country, with its cooperation. ""Our governments will expand existing facilities on Manus Island, as well as establishing further facilities in Papua New Guinea,"" Rudd said. ""There is no cap on the number of people who can be transferred to Papua New Guinea."" Those not recognized as legitimate refugees would be sent packing again. The government has kicked off an ad campaign on traditional and social media in various pan-Asian languages to warn of the possibility of getting stuck in the new asylum cul-de-sac. It has drawn hefty criticism from some Australian politicians as being inhumane. As a consolation, if fewer boats arrive as a result of the policy, Australia plans to raise the number of legal asylum seekers it takes, Rudd said. Human trafficking and votes . The new law is designed to discourage ""boat people"" from paying human traffickers thousands of dollars to ferry them to Australia on unseaworthy crafts. ""Our country has had enough of people smugglers exploiting asylum seekers and seeing them drown on the high seas,"" said Rudd, who previously served as foreign minister. He is also tired of watching Australian crews risk their lives to fish passengers from waters in front of the Christmas Islands, where rusting buckets carrying them invariably capsize. The number of illegal immigrants arriving by boat spiked between 1999 and 2001, according to the Australian parliament, only to flatline after a few years. There has been a recent uptick, which has become an irritant to some Australians. Rudd, who heads the left-wing Labor Party, faces an election in September, and his opponent's Liberal Party has dominated in the polls. His party recently voted down former Prime Minister Julia Gillard who was widely unpopular and put Rudd in her place to court favor with voters before time runs out. The new law, which Rudd's government delivered, could also play well with more conservative Australian voters and garner Rudd's party more votes. Riots over . Back on Nauru, things have calmed down. Authorities have moved the asylum seekers to an alternative location and have set up tented temporary housing. The flames spared the kitchen, so there is food to go around for the ""transferees."" And the rioters may face legal consequences for their actions, Australia's immigration minister said. They could wander from the refugee camp to jail. ""The sort of crimes that appear to be committed are serious -- with prison sentences,"" Tony Burke said. But they have returned to the camp. There is no place else for them to go on the tiny island, or much of anywhere else.

"(CNN) -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's new initiative, Internet.org, is a global partnership aimed at ""making Internet access available to all."" Is that an attainable goal? Perhaps. It's certainly very ambitious. There are several major hurdles to overcome. Opinion: Zuckerberg's big idea is no charity . For many of the 5 billion people who live in less developed parts of the world, the two largest barriers to becoming Internet-connected are the cost of devices and the cost of connection. The next obstacle is the expense of maintaining a device. In many countries, electricity is still difficult to come by, with brownouts common. In Africa, for example, people experience an average of 56 days of power outage a year, almost 15% of the year. Even if a network is running, the cost of electricity itself is very expensive. The cost of a kilowatt hour of electricity in Africa can vary anywhere from $0.06 in South Africa to $0.68 in Chad. A phone like an iPhone 5 requires about 3.73 kWh a year to charge depending on use, meaning it could cost as much as $2.53 a year to just charge the phone. While this does not sound like a lot of money, the average income for a person in Chad is about $2,000, which means that 0.1% of annual income would be spent just on the electricity to power a phone. Of course, this cost increases with more use. Typical usage in developing areas like Africa focuses on low consumption actions like sending SMS messages, phone calls and mobile banking. More demanding usage like streaming video, downloading and playing games, and spending time connecting on social networking sites, would require the most energy intensive part of the phone -- the screen -- to be on longer, which would raise the yearly costs of charging the phone. Increasing the battery life and decreasing the energy requirements of transmission are great goals to strive for -- as Internet.org plans to pursue -- but they do not address the underlying issue of being able to afford a charge in the first place. When the average yearly income is so low in developing countries, there is not much disposable income after housing, food and transportation costs. The fact of the matter is that most of the 5 billion people who are poor would rather spend their money on basic necessities like food and medicine than on the Internet. For example, a few years ago I visited an orphanage in Lusaka, Zambia, that had no Internet connection even though a major fiber line is about 50 yards away. While the heads of the orphanage understood the importance of the Internet, and while many of the children would have liked to explore the Web, funds were better spent caring for the orphans. Even giving the connectivity away does not help pay all the other costs associated with accessing the Internet. If we really want to get the next 5 billion people connected, we will have to steer governmental and consumer electronic interests to work together on a solution. Innovating new and inventive techniques to provide infrastructure, low-cost devices and energy generation stand the best chance of making a difference. Maybe Internet.org can look into devices like kinetic chargers, solar powered cell phones, and pico cells, which can make a far bigger impact to connect the underserved populations of the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason A. Buckweitz.","Mark Zuckerberg is starting an initiative to bring Internet access to 5 billion people .

"(CNN) -- On the surface, Zack Hix is like many 18-year-olds. The Simpsonville, South Carolina, teen's favorite foods are cheeseburgers and pizza. He listens to rock and punk music. He loves to race mountain bikes, play video games, watch Georgia Bulldogs football with his dad and -- perhaps most importantly -- draw. But Zack also suffers from a laundry list of mental health issues, including both intermittent explosive- and obsessive-compulsive disorders, which make him different from other kids his age and threaten to inhibit his ability to function as an independent adult. Zack is diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression, in addition to the IED and OCD. He also has Tourette syndrome and tics that are the result of a Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infection in the fifth grade. Artistic self-expression through drawing helps to balance Zack's struggles. Together, the Hix family is on a journey to turn a series of Zack's characters into a career as a cartoonist. ""If we can make a go of this and he can work for himself doing what he loves to do -- chances are he is not going to be able to work in a traditional setting; they're so up and down with how they function -- maybe he can support himself after high school and not have to sit back and collect disability as a person who cannot hold a job,"" his mother, Kim Hix, said. The Good Boy Roy crew -- including Roy, Zman and Rocker Rick -- are charismatic, athletic and musically talented. They are likenesses of Zack and those close to him. Life's joys and tribulations also inspire Zack's art, whether it's expressing his faith in God, standing up to bullies or maintaining a positive outlook on life. ""The images come to my head,"" he says. ""I just capture them and put them on paper."" 'I know that it is the illness' Kim Hix, 46, is the president of Good Boy Roy, in addition to her roles as part-time personal trainer, an advocate for children in court proceedings and, of course, full-time mother. ""When Zack does awful things, I know that is the illness,"" she says. ""He is so loving and sweet and thinks of others."" She knew early on that Zack was different, she says. He wouldn't sleep alone, screamed to the point where she thought he was going to hurt himself and had trouble processing the reasons he was disciplined. The family had no history of mental disorders, so Kim Hix started taking Zack to doctors. ""We didn't know what to think,"" she says. ""We were kind of bewildered."" Zack's father, Doug Hix, says it sometimes feels like they are isolated and on an island, but points out that many people have it worse. Kim Hix says Zack's struggles continue to affect the family, especially Kelsie, 14. ""None of this is in your control really,"" says Kim. ""You can't fix these things. If it's a bad day, if it's chaotic, you pray a lot and when you wake up you hope the next day is better."" No broad brush on his symptoms . Zack has seen psychiatrist Dr. Robert Richards since elementary school. Richards doesn't use a broad brush to describe Zack's symptoms, he says, because the disorders manifest themselves differently according to the individual, the responsiveness to treatment and the resources available. But Richards did classify Zack's problems as severe. Still, the teen has a ""high-level of sensitivity and intuitiveness,"" Richards said. His drawings could be a way for him to express his view that people should be treated with kindness. ""If you look at other aspects of personality growth and development, he has a strong capacity for empathy,"" says Richards. Dr. Ken Duckworth, a psychiatrist and the medical director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, says the two most important variables in treating mental disorders and illness are family support and the patient's willingness to accept help from loved ones. Kim says Zack is family-oriented, always wanting to be near and spend time with his parents. ""I can't tell them how much I love them in words,"" says Zack. Doug Hix, who has been married to Kim for 21 years, works for an engineering company. At times, his work puts him on the road for two or three weeks a month. When he is home, Doug says he makes spending time with his children a priority. He and Zack race mountain bikes, follow the Atlanta Braves and never miss a University of Georgia football game. ""When he's at a calm state, when he's the Zack that we know and love, he's a great kid,"" Doug Hix says. ""If his med levels are where they need to be, he can focus. Interaction with faculty and student body, it's spot on. You'd never expect anything."" It's those other times -- when he can't remain calm -- that trouble his parents. Zack's OCD can cause him to grasp onto single thoughts. He'll want to do things perfectly and not being able to can sometimes propel him into a rage that can last for hours, his mother says. The episodes have occurred since Zack was a child. Enter Good Boy Roy . Zack has drawn pictures since he was old enough to hold a pen. He has always gravitated toward cartoons, Japanimation characters and superheroes, his parents say. Drawing seems to provide Zack the context his compulsions won't allow, and his mother says he's always used artistic expression to apologize after acting out. The characters are based on Zack and those close to him. Volleyball Girl was inspired by his younger sister, Kelsie, and Handsome Hen takes after the man who introduced Zack to ""The Simpsons,"" his uncle Henry. In 2009, Zack took a stack of Good Boy Roy drawings to his mother and asked what she thought. She liked them enough to have one printed on a red T-shirt, his favorite color. Zack wore the shirt everywhere. Kim Hix had already considered making Good Boy Roy a business, but when she saw how proud the T-shirt made Zack, she wondered if it might be a way for Zack to support himself after high school if his mental health issues prove to be barriers to employment. ""I have always been a fixer,"" she said. ""That has been my job since Zack was born, trying to get him help and get him the resources that can help him progress."" Since 2010, Zack's mother says he has made about $12,000 from merchandise and custom design sales, so the business is very much part-time. He has also illustrated a children's book, ""A World Without Circles."" The book's publisher has asked Zack to work on a children's book about bullying, something he experienced during middle school related to his Tourette's syndrome, his mother says. Zack plans to graduate from high school in 2014 and hopes to continue spreading Good Boy Roy's message. He wants Roy, Zman and Rocker Rick to be known worldwide so they can inspire others with disabilities to find work. Meanwhile, Kim Hix is learning how to juggle building a business with her own career and being a mother and wife. It's still very much a work in progress, but she hopes Good Boy Roy will reach other families dealing with mental health disorders and let them know they're not alone. ""Good Boy Roy, the business and brand, was launched to share with the world this story of hope, determination and overcoming challenges; [to] reach parents of children like Zack, to let them know they are not alone in their heartache and uncertainty; [to] let the kids know that anything is possible, and being different is OK.""","Zack Hix is the creator of the cartoon characters in Good Boy Roy .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Summerhill, a rundown neighborhood near downtown, sits in the shadow of Turner Field, home to baseball's Atlanta Braves. Vacant buildings abut empty lots, which are rented for parking during games. The area feels like a ghost town during the day -- it's not the sort of place you want to be at night -- but it can fill in fast. The Braves played the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday. Police set up roadblocks while tailgaters cracked beers and music blared. As fans flooded the streets, they were struck by something new. Painters, moving over walls like mechanical ants, were transforming nearby buildings into brightly colored murals. They were there for a project called Living Walls. Twenty artists converged on Atlanta this month as part of the annual conference, now in its fourth year. They come with one goal: to put art in the streets, in places it usually isn't, with the hope of sparking a conversation and effecting change. This year, 10 of the artists are local; 10 are international. ""It's been so dead around here,"" said Reandra Davis, 62. She sat under an umbrella in a Summerhill lot, where she has sold parking spaces for some 35 years. Davis' spot gave her a clear view of at least one of the buildings being painted. ""It's beautiful where it used to be desolate. It brings everything alive,"" she said. From graffiti to galleries: Street vs. public art . 'A change brings on new things' The Israeli artist known as Know Hope matched his wall. The artist wore blue pants and a blue shirt. Both were covered in white paint, which he had used to draw birds against a blue background. ""You can take your art and it can become part of real life,"" he said. ""When you place it in a certain environment, it becomes a part of the daily lives of the people that live in the space."" Know Hope, 27, was one of several artists this year assigned walls in Summerhill. They clustered around three blocks on Georgia Avenue. Spray cans were stacked in cardboard boxes on the street. Drops of yellow, blue and orange paint peppered the sidewalk. The murals were so large in some cases that the artists used cherry pickers to move around -- stopping to spray there, paint here. Conference organizers provided the equipment and materials and worked to secure permission. Unlike graffiti, these murals are legal -- a distinction many in the neighborhood were keen to draw. ""I don't like seeing graffiti. That's just something that messes up peoples' buildings. This is more like art,"" said Willis J. Matthews, 66, a house painter. He has been hired over the years to buff over graffiti on some of the same Summerhill buildings the artists painted. Jerome Nelson, 50, manager of a local restaurant, likewise said he had covered graffiti in the past, but would be happy to see more murals. ""It makes you want to take care of your 'hood a little better now. You know, if you're constantly waking up every morning -- seeing the same old thing that's been here for years -- you think that's how it goes. But a change brings on new things,"" he said. 'What we're doing is extremely political' As part of its conference, Living Walls hosts parties, lectures and a bike tour of the newly minted walls. The project has not been without controversy. Two of the pieces created last year were subsequently painted over because of complaints. In one case, neighbors objected to nudity. In the other, some thought the image looked demonic. ""After those two, I realized that what we're doing is extremely political,"" said Monica Campana, 30, co-founder of Living Walls. This year, she said she warned artists their work could be short-lived. They were asked to submit sketches ahead of time, but no subject was off limits. ""Whatever you decide to do, it has to be part of this area,"" Campana said she told the artists. Apparently, none minded. The French artist Roti, who did one of the murals that got covered, came back to paint again this year. He worked on a so-called recycled wall, a space previously painted by another artist. ""I love the ephemeral aspect of street art or graffiti. I don't believe that things should stay put,"" said Campana. ""Even though it sucked that we had to lose two walls, it's like Roti says, those two walls had beautiful lives. They were short lives, but they were very intense lives. They did what they needed to do and they made people think,"" she said. ""It created a dialogue."" Roti, whose first name is Pierre, comes from a graffiti background and continues to work in that medium. He declined to give his last name because he said some of what he does is not legal. Unlike some Summerhill residents, Roti, 24, sees little difference between graffiti and murals. He aims to provoke in either case. ""Graffiti's a sport. They're just taking it to a whole new level,"" said Campana. Like this story? Like CNN Living on Facebook . Is there interesting art on the streets of your town?

"(CNN) -- A national group opposed to same-sex marriage aimed to fight it by driving ""a wedge between gays and blacks"" and identifying ""glamorous"" Latino artists and athletes to advocate traditional marriage, according to newly released confidential memos. The strategies were among several pursued by the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), which has actively campaigned against same-sex marriage efforts. The Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization, said it obtained the documents, part of a civil action in Maine, on Monday and published them on its website. ""This court-ordered disclosure shows NOM fighting a losing battle with strategy and tactics that are racially and ethnically divisive, filled with false political calculations, and out of touch with the majority of fair-minded Americans,"" Human Rights Campaign said in a statement. Most of the memos were written in 2009. The president of NOM did not dispute the authenticity of the memos, saying in an online statement, ""Gay marriage is not a civil right."" The memos highlight several efforts to fight same-sex marriage initiatives, which NOM contended were backed by the ""pro-gay Obama agenda."" ""The Latino vote in America is a key swing vote, and will be so even more so in the future because of demographic growth,"" one NOM memo states. ""Will the process of assimilation to the dominant Anglo culture lead Hispanics to abandon traditional family values? We can interrupt this process of assimilation by making support for marriage a key badge of Latino identity."" Plans included Spanish language radio and TV ads, pamphlets and YouTube videos. NOM also targeted what it termed ""Democratic power bosses"" it claimed were inclined to put the interests of gay rights groups ""over the values of African-Americans."" ""The strategic goal of this project is to drive a wedge between gays and blacks -- two key Democratic constituencies,"" another memo states. ""Find, equip, energize and connect African-American spokespeople for marriage; develop a media campaign around their objections to gay marriage as a civil right; provoke the gay marriage base into responding by denouncing these spokesmen and women as bigots. No politician wants to take up and push an issue that splits the base of the party."" NOM argued ""gay marriage is the tip of the spear, the weapon that will be and is being used to marginalize and repress Christianity and the Church."" The organization said Tuesday it was proud of its ""strong record"" on minority partnerships. Brian Brown, president of NOM, touted the group's work with prominent African-American and Hispanic leaders. ""Gay marriage advocates have attempted to portray same-sex marriage as a civil right, but the voices of these and many other leaders have provided powerful witness that this claim is patently false,"" Brown said in a statement. ""Gay marriage is not a civil right, and we will continue to point this out in written materials such as those released in Maine. We proudly bring together people of different races, creeds and colors to fight for our most fundamental institution: marriage."" NOM has been instrumental in the campaign to stop same-sex marriage laws, including Maine. Lawmakers there in early 2009 approved a measure legalizing such marriages, but voters in the state later that year passed a referendum to overturn the new law. An effort is currently under way to put a similar measure on the ballot this coming November. A coalition on Tuesday launched Mainers United for Marriage, which wants Maine to become the first state to win marriage for same-sex couples through a ballot measure. The release of NOM documents follows the successful 2009 efforts to overturn Maine's same-sex marriage law. The court case came about after the Maine Ethics Commission opened an investigation based on a fund-raising complaint from Fred Karger of Californians Against Hate.

"(CNN) -- It's not often that I agree with Sarah Palin. But when she comes around to a liberal point of view on an issue, that is to be noted with praise. So, good for you, Sarah, for flip-flopping on the issue of hard work. Palin took to Facebook recently to praise the remarks of liberal actor Ashton Kutcher, who has in the past donated tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats and participated in a star-studded video pledging, ""to serve our President (Obama) and all mankind."" So how did this Hollywood liberal become the darling of Sarah Palin? By speaking out on behalf of a truly liberal value: hard work. ""I believe that opportunity looks a lot like hard work,"" Kutcher said in a speech he gave at the Teen Choice Awards. ""I've never had a job in my life that I was better than. I was always just lucky to have a job. And every job I had was a steppingstone to my next job, and I never quit my job until I had my next job."" Palin and other conservatives lept to embrace Kutcher's comments, as though they were conservative. They are, of course, profoundly liberal. It is liberals who honor, extoll and reward hard work. That's why President Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and virtually all Democrats support raising the minimum wage -- to honor and reward those who choose work over welfare, and ensure an honest day's work pays enough to feed a family. That's why President Obama and the Democrats cut taxes on working people by $3,600 over four years. And that's why President Obama won the votes of working-class Americans (those making less than $100,000 a year) by a full 10 points. But perhaps Palin and others on the right have seen the light. Perhaps Kutcher's bracing and bold statement of liberalism has moved them. If so, let's see them walk the walk. Because at the present moment Republicans seem to honor wealth and punish work. How else can you explain that they want a tax code in which a billionaire heiress pays nothing on her inheritance, while the hard-working maid who makes the heiress' bed pays taxes on every nickel she earns? Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney pocketed $42 million during 2011 and 2012. He did not earn that money from work -- he accrued it through wealth. His investments garnered him tens of millions while he ran around the country campaigning. And yet Romney paid merely 12% in taxes. By contrast, a cop married to a teacher, each making the median income of around $50,000 a year, pays a marginal tax rate of 25%. Even with deductions they are almost certainly paying a greater percentage of their income in taxes than mega-millionaire Romney. Palin, who famously quit on the people of Alaska when she got too big for the gig of governing her beautiful state, is an especially unfortunate spokesperson for the value of hard work. One hopes she takes Kutcher's liberal advice to heart, and supports working people in word and deed. And if Palin liked Kutcher's Teen Choice remarks, she'll love this statement: ""Success may not come quickly or easily. But if you strive to do what's right, if you work harder and dream bigger, if you set an example in your own lives and do your part to help meet the challenges of our time, then I'm confident that, together, we will continue the never-ending task of perfecting our union."" Those are not the words of Ashton Kutcher. No, the liberal extolling hard work and patriotism in those comments was Palin's president -- and mine and Ashton Kutcher's and every American's president: Barack Obama. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.","Sarah Palin praised Ashton Kutcher for his speech about the importance of working hard .

"(CNN) -- Welcome to our new look at what you're saying over the past week. 'The system isn't really encouraging' Our weekend piece on why youths aren't being tested for HIV got more than 1,000 comments. Commenter Bradgina said they've found that just getting an HIV test from some doctors can be a hassle, and they go to the clinic under an assumed name: . ""It's still like pulling teeth getting doctors to test for HIV,"" they write. ""One doctor actually asked me, 'Do you know how hard it is to get HIV from a woman?' To which I replied, 'I don't think I ever said anything about being involved with a woman. ...' And he then offered me a test. Wow. I had to pretend to be gay to get an HIV test."" Bradgina later added that ""the system isn't really encouraging of getting tested on a regular basis anyway."" 'That will never happen, and you're all nuts' Another weekend piece, on fitness tips from swimsuit model Kate Upton's trainer, sparked a lively debate on Upton's body and curves. ""I get a little annoyed when people whine and scream about this model or that model 'being fat,' wrote commenter dragonfire77. ""They're in a physical condition that is orders of magnitude better than the 'average' American, and infinitely healthier than those twig-like, death-warmed-over models you see walking the catwalk at your average fashion show."" Commenter Deanna weighed in, ""I have a feeling that every single person who is criticizing this woman is a troll, with body hair and belly fat. Let's see you look this hot in a bathing suit. That will NEVER happen, and you're all nuts."" 'Don't blame guns at all' Another debate, with more than 1,100 comments, followed a story on Chicago's homicide rate and the lack of a Level I trauma center on the city's violence-plagued South Side. ""Don't blame guns at all,"" wrote commenter LMT556 in the highest-voted comment on the story. ""Poverty and single parent households are raising a violent culture."" But ""not all who are single parents or live in poverty raise violent kids,"" replied commenter JoAnn Smith. ""My mom raised 11 kids, 9 boys (and) 2 girls, and guess what only one of my brothers decided to do what he wanted to do and now he is dead because of his actions. ... You cannot solely blame the poverty and single parenting on violence. I know people that grew up with two parents and they are just as hardheaded as those who lived in a single parent household. These parents need to stop acting like they are their kids' friends and discipline a child when needed."" 'Hurry up and find a way to grow organs' More than 300 commenters also shared their thoughts on the story of Molly Pearce, a California woman who needs four organs transplanted in order to survive. Some shared messages of support for Pearce, while others discussed organ donation and the meaning of ""brain dead."" ""Articles like this make me wish they would hurry up and find a way to grow organs for people who need them,"" said commenter DS. ""I know they're working on it but I still wish we had the technology already so the poor folks waiting for someone to die wouldn't have to anymore.""","More than 1,000 comments were posted on our youth and HIV story .

"(CNN) -- Satire and mockery are part of politics. Sometimes they attack not the policy but the person, going from nuanced to nasty. But surely not ""everything goes."" Promoting violence and applauding abuse -- there's just no excuse for it. The latest uproar occurred at the Missouri State Fair, when a rodeo clown wearing an Obama mask invited the crowd to cheer if they wanted to see ""Obama run down by a bull."" ""As they were bringing the bulls into the chute and prepping them,"" Perry Beam told USA Today, ""...they bring out what looks like a dummy. The announcer says 'Here's our Obama dummy, or our dummy of Obama. They mentioned the president's name, I don't know, 100 times..."" Beam was there with his wife and a foreign exchange student who got a lesson in American political ""civility."" The reaction was bipartisan. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a and Sen. Claire McCaskill, both Democrats, weighed in with disapproval. And Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a Republican, said on Twitter he found the performance ""disrespectful."" That's an understatement. ""We are better than this."" One hopes so. What are we to make, though, of a Slap Hillary website, suspiciously resurrected by an anti-Hillary PAC? The PAC sent out tweets to reporters in hopes, I suspect, of stirring up the red meat base, get publicity, and solicit money. It provocatively asked journalists, ""Have you slapped Hillary today?"" First posted 13 years ago, the site shows a cartoon of Hillary's face. When a button is pressed, a hand slaps her so hard she reacts like a bobble doll, her head bouncing from side to side as her eyes cross. The ""SlapHillary Team,"" which hosts the ""game,"" says they are ""a grass roots, nonprofit organization."" BuzzFeed's Andrew Kaczynski did some research and found its treasurer, Christopher M. Marston, is a Republican campaign finance consultant and former member of the Bush administration. The Super PAC defended itself and posted a link to a ""Slap Palin"" website. The PAC isn't contrite, saying on its website, ""We didn't see the liberal media bemoaning this ""Slap Palin"" game when it came out! They only care when it's the candidate they support for president."" There's something suspicious about the ""Slap Palin"" site -- a paucity of comments, just 19 in 2008 and only two last year, indicates a set-up. A little more research revealed that the ""Slap Palin"" is hosted on a computer at the same address in downtown Washington that hosts a ""Slap Clinton"" and ""Slap Obama"" site. We can perhaps relegate the ""Slap Palin-Clinton-Obama"" anonymous owner to the fringe. But what are we to say when a former administration official and current campaign consultant to one of the major parties promotes violence against public figures? It doesn't matter if the website -- or rodeo clown -- encourages violence against a Democrat or a Republican, a male or female. It's wrong. It's vile. It's one of the few true evils in politics. Those who promote or approve ""slapping"" or ""shooting"" or ""running over by a bull"" any public official should be shamed and shunned. Virtual violence needs to be denounced and never justified because it's political. Still, given the extent of domestic violence -- 25% of American women will experience domestic violence in their lives -- encouraging people to slap or abuse female elected officials is particularly pernicious. Slapping women so hard their heads bobble is not a game, not even virtually. We need to go further, and condemn activities that show no respect for elected officials. Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman of Texas' 36th District issued an invitation to the rodeo clown to appear at a rodeo in his district. ""Liberals want to bronco bust dissent,"" Stockman said. ""But Texans value speech, even if its speech they don't agree with."" This isn't about liberals or conservatives, Congressman; it's about respect for elected officials, and coupling violence with ridicule. It's one thing to use free speech to parody or satirize a politician, and another to couple violence with a deliberate showing of disrespect. When Harry Truman was campaigning in his home state of Missouri (where the rodeo clown performed), he took questions from a high school audience. A teenage boy asked him a question about their town councilman, called him, ""Our local yokel."" Truman lit into the boy. Politics is a noble art, Truman said. It's difficult to forge consensus and lead fighting factions for the common good. But this is what politicians do. They deserve respect. The boy was chastened, and apologized. Knowing, however, that a public scolding by a man of his stature could affect the boy's self-esteem for a long time, Truman talked with him after the assembly, and invited him to write and tell him about his grades. They corresponded until the boy graduated college. We have to make our civic discourse civil again. We have to recognize that virtual violence masquerading as ridicule is vicious; it's a toxic atmosphere we allow by our silence. We hear a lot about what's wrong with Washington. What's wrong isn't Washington. It's us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","A website, Slap Hillary, invites the public to slap a cartoon face of Hillary Clinton .

"(CNN) -- President Obama has proposed expanding high-speed Internet access in public schools across the country. That seems like an obviously good idea, to me and probably to you too. But of course, there is a rub: money. The initiative is expected to cost $4 to $6 billion. The federal government is hardly flush with cash these days. How then will it pay the price of doing something good? The president is suggesting that the Federal Communications Commission raise the charges on cell phone users -- that is, basically, all of us (there are today more cell phones than people in the United States) -- by $4 a year for the next three years. That is small change, to be sure, in a world of trillion dollar deficits. Who among us would begrudge today's youth better Internet access for a penny or so a day? And that may well be the ""right"" answer, from a moral and public policy perspective. But it is still worth pausing to make an important bigger point. We see here the same old deal with the devil that our government has been making for decades now. Liberals like President Obama propose doing something good -- better Internet access for all today, health insurance for all Americans some days back. But, heaven forbid, we cannot ask wealthy Americans to pay disproportionately for the change. Indeed, we cannot even touch the income tax -- the one major American tax that at least pretends to be progressive -- to pay for any new social wants and needs at all. The fact is that the changes we made to the income tax in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 -- the ""fiscal cliff"" fix deal from the wee early days of 2013 that raised the marginal rate on married couples earning more than $450,000 a year (yes, $450,000 a year) back to its 2001 level of 39.6%, and so on -- are supposed to be permanent. Even if ""permanent"" means something like a wedding vow in my home state of California -- a year or two? -- it is clearly too early to revisit that political hot potato. Raising tax rates on the rich is a once-a-decade affair at best. Raising taxes on the middle class has become more like our daily bread. All of the 2013 changes to the income and other taxes -- such as the gift and estate tax, which was ""permanently"" made largely irrelevant for 99.7% of Americans -- brought in far less revenue to the government than the expiration of the ""payroll tax holiday."" This latter change happened quietly, without need for any congressional action, as with the proposed mobile phone fee. As a bottom line, payroll taxes on all wage earners increased by 2% of earnings up to approximately $110,000. The social security ""contribution"" -- not labeled a tax, mind you -- thereby went up by as much as $4000 for a married couple. We're talking over $10 a day, now. This politically well hidden tax increase brought in almost twice as much revenue to Uncle Sam as all other 2013 changes combined. And so the fundamental things continue to apply as time goes by -- it is the middle class that pays, and the more hidden the ""surcharges,"" ""user fees,"" ""contributions"" and so on, the better. Back to the episode du jour. Obama's proposed increase in mobile phone fees is especially well hidden, as a ""charge"" that the FCC alone can impose, without congressional action, on account of the ""Gore tax"" from 1996, whereby then-Vice President Al Gore helped give the FCC this power. Obama's proposal continues a trend of various forms of ""excise"" and user taxes -- on cigarettes, gasoline, alcohol, and telephone use, on both state and federal levels -- that is rising and accelerating. Obama was unable to deliver on his campaign pledge to raise income taxes in his first term, but he did raise federal cigarette taxes, for example, by 64 cents a pack in 2009, to just over a dollar, and he recently proposed nearly doubling that level. Meantime, there are already 17% worth of various taxes and users fees on cell phones, which the new proposal would only increase. States and localities have been raising sales taxes for years now. No one who follows government or tax policy will be shocked if we one day, likely sooner rather than later, get a national sales or ""value-added"" tax (VAT) to ... well, to fund all the good that government does. Now I happen to be a liberal who supports all this government good. But I am also a tax lawyer and professor who see the reality of the new class warfare in the U.S. Here's that reality: The middle class is being gouged to pay for programs for all, including the poor. That may all be fine and good, until one day we realize that you cannot keep getting blood from a stone, and the middle class becomes poor, too. Then we will be left with only the rich to ask for a fair share -- unless, of course, the rich have gotten ahead of the curve, and are no longer hanging around in America for the asking. But they wouldn't do that, now, would they? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Edward J. McCaffery.","President Obama's plan to fund ConnectEd is to charge cell phone users .

"(CNN) -- Does our government trust us? If our government trusts us, why does it take people like Edward Snowden and Bradley Manning to reveal the actions our government is taking in our name? Government should be able to withhold information in certain situations if disclosure truly compromises ongoing intelligence operations or clearly risks lives. But that exception must be narrowly construed, and the burden should rest on the government to prove that the information at issue should be kept secret from Americans. Recently, two seemingly unrelated events show our government's continuing efforts to keep information from us. In the first instance, the government released hundreds of hours of tapes that Richard Nixon had secretly recorded of White House conversations between April 9, 1973 and July 2, 1973. While political pundits had a field day combing through these tapes, lost in all this were two things. One, the content of these tapes has been kept secret from us for more than 40 years. Two, the government still won't release more than 700 hours of additional tapes, citing national security and privacy concerns. Could there really be information in these 40-plus-year-old tapes that threatens our nation's security or invades someone's privacy? And even if there is, shouldn't our government be called upon to provide us more reasons to justify its secrecy? In the case of Bradley Manning, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison for providing WikiLeaks with 700,000 classified files, we became aware of a wide range of actions taken by our military, State Department and intelligence community. We learned, for example, that the U.S. military had been keeping detailed data about the number of Iraqi civilians killed by our forces. Before this leak, our government had denied it kept such figures. We learned that our government was spying on U.N. officials in violation of international law and our State Department had been encouraging foreign governments to not investigate our torture of prisoners who had been subject to rendition. Manning also released the infamous video of a U.S. Apache helicopter attack in Baghdad in which civilians and a reporter were killed. Reuters had previously requested this exact video under the Freedom of Information Act but the government had denied access. Not only does it appear that our government doesn't trust us, but it also seems that some agencies within our government don't even trust each other. A few months ago, James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, was asked by Congress whether the National Security Agency was collecting data on Americans. Clapper answered under oath, ""No."" Of course, a short time later, Snowden revealed that Clapper was not being truthful. When you look at our nation's Declaration of Independence, one of the clauses that has always stuck with me is, ""Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. ..."" But how can we consent to our government's actions if we are not told what it's doing? Conversely, how can we object to our government's conduct if it isn't revealed to us? Shockingly, even some members of Congress seem to be in the dark about our government's activities, even though the administration has provided information in a restricted fashion. On Sunday's morning TV, Sen. Bob Corker, the senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, commented that he and others in Congress aren't sure of the full extent of the NSA's surveillance programs that were leaked by Snowden. Corker said, ""And that's why I wrote a letter to the president this week to ask that the head of this organization (NSA) come in and brief folks from top to bottom."" Keep in mind this is months after Snowden's leaks. This begs the question: Does anyone actually know the full scope of what our government is doing? Just this week, our government finally released former President Gerald Ford's testimony recorded more than 30 years ago during the criminal trial of Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme, the woman convicted of trying to assassinate Ford. Did the government release this information on its own? Nope, it took a federal lawsuit by the Eastern District Historical Society to pry it free. If our government continues to hide information from us, the Edward Snowdens and Bradley Mannings of the world will not stay silent despite threats of imprisonment. More Americans will take matters into their own hands when they see our government engaging in policies and programs that violate our Constitution, laws and principles. It is truly our government's choice. Trust us and be more transparent, or inspire more Snowdens and Mannings. I hope our government chooses to trust us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Why does it take Edward Snowden to reveal actions of our government?

"(CNN) -- Fifty years ago this month, I chanced to hear the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. I was a mild-mannered kid with a speech impediment and a love of math. That day, I was focused on solving math problems, not issues of justice and equal rights. But King broke through to me when he said this: If the children of Birmingham march, Americans will see that what they are asking for is a better education. They will see that even the very young know the difference between right and wrong. I chose to march, and found myself among hundreds of children jailed for five terrifying days. Mind you, I was not a brave child. But even at 12 years old, I believed and hoped that my participation could make a difference. Twenty-five years later, I had made my way to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. My colleagues and I had an outrageous dream: Perhaps a young research university -- just 20 years old -- could alter the course of minority performance in higher education, particularly in the sciences. Baltimore philanthropists Robert and Jane Meyerhoff shared our vision. TED.com: How to escape education's death valley . And now people ask: What magic have we hit upon that has enabled us to become a national model for educating students of all races in a wide range of disciplines? How did we -- as a predominantly white university with a strong liberal arts curriculum -- become one of the top producers of minority scientists in the country? Rather than magic, there are a number of educational principles at work. And what my colleagues and I have found is that they all grow out of one key truth: The world does not always have to be as it is today. TED.com: Hey science teachers, make it fun . To start, we faced up to some particularly tough questions: Why weren't more students from traditionally underrepresented groups succeeding? In what ways was the university responsible? What questions weren't we even thinking to ask? The lessons we learned took shape in the Meyerhoff Scholars Program, which has grown into a national model for producing minority students who earn advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and math. TED.com: Our failing schools -- enough is enough . In fact, a number of campuses across the nation have been replicating the program, including most recently the University of North Carolina and Penn State. Along the way, we discovered that the strategies that helped minority students initially could be just as effective in helping students across racial and economic groups and across the disciplines -- throughout the arts, humanities and social sciences: . Work from strengths and set high expectations. Too often, we focus on deficits. We see poor preparation or lack of family support, rather than seeing underdeveloped talent and tenacity. At UMBC, we look at a student's background as context, not as destiny. We set high expectations, and both challenge and support students to ensure their success. Build a community of scholars. We help students develop strong peer networks and encourage them to see one another as partners, rather than competitors. It is effective -- and powerful -- when students support and hold one another accountable. Engage students in meaningful research. When asked who contributed most to their academic success, students will almost always mention a faculty member. Faculty-student connections are critical, and it's especially important that faculty engage students in meaningful research. We like to say: It takes researchers to produce researchers. Hold yourself to quantifiable progress. We constantly evaluate the outcomes of our work, and that evaluation is data-driven, not anecdotal. For example, we know that the various features of the Meyerhoff Scholars Program -- peer support groups, intensive advising, early research experiences -- work in combination. UMBC's students graduate, and they go on in large numbers to earn Ph.D.s in science and engineering. But which elements of our approach are most critical and cost-effective? We're currently working on a project funded by the National Science Foundation to tease that out. If we don't look critically at what works -- and what does not -- we can't recalibrate and continue to improve. Keep at it. A graduate recently wrote me to share a quote from Aristotle: ""We are what we repeatedly do; excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."" To fuel that kind of persistence, hold fast to this one key truth: The world does not always have to be as it is today.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama knows we live in a two-tiered America. In July, the president, who is himself an example of how anyone can or should be able make it in the Land of the Free, went on the road to make the point over and over again that the nation's widening gap between rich and poor is tearing at the very fabric of society. ""Even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits,"" the president said in prepared remarks delivered in Illinois, ""nearly all the income gains of the past 10 years have continued to flow to the top 1%."" ""I will seize any opportunity I can find,"" he told The New York Times later that month, ""to work with Congress to strengthen the middle class, improve their prospects, improve their security."" Any opportunity? OK, then. Here's one: How about paying your interns? As Emily Jane Fox, a former unpaid White House intern herself, reports for CNNMoney, the White House is coming under pressure from groups like the Fair Pay Campaign to pay the college students who work 9-to-6 jobs (at least) for no money. Fox told me it cost her ""a couple thousand dollars"" to take a White House internship in 2010. ""Think about it,"" she said. ""You're there for three months. You're relocating to a new city. You have to pay rent. You have to pay transportation costs to and from the White House."" Plus: She had to buy a suit. Can't afford an internship? Try asking for donations . ""You have to be able to afford to be a White House intern."" Maybe intern pay and the health of the middle class, on first glance, seem unrelated. I saw a few tweets saying it's no big thing that the White House doesn't pay interns. ""No. It's called 'paying your dues,'"" one woman wrote. ""Give school credit or something!"" But internships are an important (maybe essential) part of the modern rÃ©sumÃ©. Without one, it's difficult to find some of the most desirable and high-paying jobs. Fox, for example, said her White House internship has come up in pretty much every job interview she's done. And she says it probably got her into graduate school. Potential interns who can't cough up thousands of dollars in living expenses are left out of the mix, or have a much harder time making the situation livable, meaning the best internships and the best jobs are more likely to go to the upper middle class and rich. It's just one of many ways middle-class and poor Americans are being left behind in the age of income inequality. The system seems rigged to ensure that wealthier Americans have a much better chance at success than their poorer counterparts. There are always great rags-to-riches examples that defy this trend. Our pop culture eats that stuff up. But statistics paint a more sobering picture: Only 9.5% of kids born into the bottom income quintile in Washington will rise to the top fifth of earners, according to a recent study from Harvard University and the University of California at Berkeley. The numbers are even worse in cities like Memphis and Atlanta. With college expenses skyrocketing and internships offering young workers little or no compensation, it's no wonder it's becoming more difficult to climb out of poverty and into the middle class. ""When the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther and farther apart, it undermines the very essence of America."" Yep, that's Obama, again. The White House isn't alone in offering an unpaid internship program -- and internships are far from being responsible for America's gap between rich and poor. Opinion: You don't have to be an unpaid intern . (CNN, for those who are wondering, does pay its interns). But the executive branch could use this opportunity to make a statement about equality of opportunity in America by offering paid internships, as many others do. Not everybody can be like Google, which, according to the site Glassdoor.com, pays some interns $6,800 per month. But look at the news site ProPublica, which made headlines when it started a Kickstarter page to raise $22,000 to hire an intern to write stories about internships. There are ways to make this work financially. And to be fair. Meanwhile, the Fair Pay Campaign is right to point out the hypocrisy of the Obama Administration lobbying for a higher minimum wage while paying some of its young workers nothing at all. The president can set an important example on this. Hard work should be rewarded with fair pay. And the playing field for new workers should be as level as possible. Otherwise, we're just encouraging the rich-poor gap to grow. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","CNNMoney reports interns at the White House are unpaid .

"(CNN) -- The answer to J. C. Penney's endless woes is right in front of its corporate eyes. The answer is wearing a plain white T-shirt. And the answer has a name: . James Dean. Penney's -- the century-old chain of midmarket department stores that were once a solid downtown presence in big cities and small towns in every state -- is floundering. It seems to be in utter turmoil, and has been for a while. Some members of its board of directors have been at each other's throats; one of those directors, William Ackman, resigned last week after publicly upbraiding the others. The CEO's office might as well have a revolving door. Last fiscal year, according to The Wall Street Journal, Penney's lost $1 billion as sales dropped 25%. After a previous CEO was fired, the company took out advertisements apologizing to its customers for what the shopping experience had become. The in-store staff was reported to be demoralized and confused as the once steadfast and prosperous chain struggled to figure out what it even is. What Penney's needs right now, more than anything else, is some defining. Enter James Dean. He died in an automobile crash in 1955 at the age of 24. He had made just three movies: ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" ""East of Eden"" and ""Giant."" But his mystique and glamour have only become bigger over the decades. James Dean, now and forever, is the very picture of youthful cool. He never grew old -- so he never grows old. What does this have to do with J. C. Penney? For years after Dean's death, there were young men all over the United States who went to Penney's for one reason: . They believed -- the rumor was widespread -- that the T-shirt for which Dean was known was a Penney Towncraft T-shirt. Plain. White. No logo. No words on it. No special tailoring. It was what James Dean -- born in Marion, Indiana, smack dab in the middle of J. C. Penney country -- favored. Or, at any rate, that was the legend -- what today might be called an urban legend. It was passed from one guy to another, without anyone being quite sure where he'd first heard it. Back then -- I can vouch for this -- young men fervently believed it, and it brought them to Penney's. Penney's, at least in their minds, was James Dean Land. Their conviction about Dean and the Penney Towncraft T-shirt was like the unshakable conviction among young Americans in the early 1960s that the lyrics to ""Louie Louie"" were dirty. Because of the pervasiveness of the belief, it became accepted reality. To quote from ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" -- which starred another beloved James, James Stewart -- ""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."" Penney's should aggressively embrace this. It should print the legend. It should pay whatever it takes to the estate of James Dean to purchase the rights to an image of him in a classic white T-shirt. And he should become the face of the chain. What has it got to lose? Nothing else is working. It has struggled with various strategies to lure shoppers, especially young shoppers. It all has failed. But James Dean is everlastingly young, perpetually rebellious. ""Live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful corpse"" is a phrase often associated with him, although he did not originate it. If Penney's were to make Dean the consistent image of the company, the stores themselves might find a fresh chance at life in the victory lane. Let Walmart and Kmart and Target and Sears and Macy's and Sam's Club and all the faceless stores in all the faceless malls be just that: faceless. Penney's needs to separate itself from the pack. James Dean, and that T-shirt, are the antithesis of, even the antidote to, so much of what ails contemporary culture. Frantic self-promotion and garish logos and slogans plastered on every surface and the ""look-at-me"" attitude of modern life -- what is a more stark rejection of that than a plain white T-shirt? If you can get customers into your store to buy one thing, they just may stay to buy other things. The trick is getting those customers to come back through the front door. James Dean did it once for Penney's, without even trying. The chain ought to roll the dice and see if he can do it again. As it is, the recent face of Penney's has been the face of its feuding board of directors, bickering with each other as if they are auditioning for a movie called ""Rebels Without a Clue."" As James Dean once cried out from a movie screen: ""You're tearing me apart!"" That has to come to an end. The stores deserve to survive and thrive, to be the reliable part of American life that they were when they were steady on their feet. Right now, J. C. Penney's problem is that no one really knows what it stands for. Let it decide it wants to stand for that which is eternal and cool. And let it turn for help to He Who Is Eternally Cool. Would it be a risk for Penney's? Would it be taking a big chance? Sure. But, as Dean himself once reportedly said: ""Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today."" That goes for businesses, too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: J. C. Penney is in trouble; could James Dean be the answer?
He says urban legend was that Dean wore Penney's plain, white Towncraft T-shirt .
He says Penney should use that; adopt Dean as face of its brand, win back customers .

"(CNN) -- Ted Cruz's excellent birther adventure has been a moment of absurdity, irony and comeuppance, for him and for many in his party. Cruz, the freshman GOP senator from Texas and a tea party darling, has made a name for himself as an incendiary obstructionist in the usually genteel Senate. He may run for president in 2016. Which means, under the Constitution, that he has to be a ""natural-born citizen."" He is indeed a natural-born citizen -- of Canada. Born in Calgary to an American mother, Cruz learned that he has unwittingly held Canadian citizenship all his life. What was in doubt, thanks to a few birthers from the right and some mischievous eggers-on from the other side, was whether he could also claim American citizenship by birth. It turns out he can, given his mother's status. Initially, Cruz issued affronted denials that he was anything but American. Then, upon discovering that he was ""technically"" also Canadian, he scrambled to disavow and formally renounce any tie to his native land -- even though dual citizens can technically become president. Cruz's comical predicament illuminates three things about the politics of American identity in this era of demographic flux. First, it is a reminder that people of color, whatever their party, are still more likely than whites to be presumed foreign. John McCain, born in the Panama Canal, and Mitt Romney, born to a father born in Mexico, never faced conspiracy theories about whether they were ersatz Americans or Americans with divided loyalties. Barack Obama, of course, did. And for a moment, at least, so did Cruz. They're the lucky ones. Millions of regular Americans who don't care about their qualifications for the presidency are nonetheless subjected daily to suspicion based on their non-whiteness. Second, those who live by race-tinged insinuations can die by them, too. Cruz felt that he had to act swiftly to nip rumors of his outsiderness in the bud because he realized just how viciously they could spread out of control. He realized this because it was members of his own party who had incubated and propagated such insinuations about whether our son-of-a-Kenyan president was insufficiently committed to the American way. What goes around comes around, and when Donald Trump (who declined to rule on Cruz's status because he hadn't ""studied it enough"") is an arbiter of national authenticity, nobody is safe. Perhaps the most delicious aspect of the Cruz citizenship flap is that his form of alleged alienness was Canadian. What could be worse, for an anti-government rugged individualist, than a blood association with the land of free health care and the home of brave bureaucrats? What could be worse, for a party struggling to diversify, than to have this Latin-Texan hopeful smothered in the blandness of a Canadian Eh? Perhaps Ted Cruz, chastened by his brush with un-American identity, will proceed with greater empathy for those on the margins of American life. Perhaps leaders in his party will learn to forego the short-term electoral benefits of whipping up white fear of decline and white mistrust of people who may seem foreign. And perhaps activists from the other party will resist the temptation to brand any nonwhite conservative as a traitor or a fraud. Or perhaps not. What is certain is that the rest of this century will bring only more and more visible instances of political leaders who embody the ethnic complexity and impurity of citizenship in the United States. The party that figures out best how to embrace that complexity and convert it into an asset will be not just the majority party. It will be the most American party. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Liu.","Eric Liu: Ted Cruz's excellent birther adventure has been a moment of absurdity, irony .

"(CNN) -- ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."" -- Martin Luther King Jr. Why so long? As I watched the announcement by Attorney General Eric Holder this past week in San Francisco -- that federal prosecutors would no longer invoke mandatory minimum sentencing laws for certain low-level, nonviolent drug offenders -- I kept asking myself: ""Why so long?"" Pardon me if I am underwhelmed by the sudden turnaround, especially in light of the evidence having been overwhelming for the past 40 years that we have been on the wrong path. These mandatory minimums were a bad idea when they were first proposed. Not because I say so, but because the evidence leads to almost no other conclusion. I came of age during America's crack epidemic and I have seen the results of this scourge on our society in my own family, where family members have suffered, their lives affected and dreams shattered. But putting them on lockdown because a judge had no discretion whatsoever was never the answer to any prayer. Not for my family, not for the millions whose ""lives have been wasted due to the drug war and the types of police tactics that have been deployed in the get-tough-on-crime movement,"" as author and law professor Michelle Alexander noted. As reported last week, amid the crack epidemic a generation ago, state and federal lawmakers had enacted a wave of tough crime measures that resulted in a nearly 800% increase in the number of prisoners in the United States, even as the population grew by only a third. The result? An increase in the number of African-American and Hispanic men convicted of drug crimes, with black men about six times as likely as white men to be incarcerated. Or in the vernacular we used back in the day when fighting against these discriminatory laws, ""Crack is used in the streets, cocaine in the suites."" And yet, one had to get caught with 100 times more powder cocaine than crack to get the same sentence. I call that racist. Even in the Obama era, although President Obama initially campaigned on a one-to-one ratio in this area of sentencing, what he signed into law in 2010 was 18-to-1. Better, but not nearly good enough. The attorney general chose the right place to make his announcement. In California the impact these draconian laws have had on prison overcrowding and related issues is front page news almost daily. The once ""Golden State"" has been ordered to release nearly 10,000 inmates from its overcrowded prisons by the end of the year to resolve a problem of ""cruel and unusual punishment"" that's been brewing for years due to, what else? You guessed it, an overly aggressive increase in sentencing. So, with all of this data, why so long for this major shift on crime? The answers are plentiful but the motive may be singular. I would like to believe that it's about a shift in our morals; that our nation has finally come to the conclusion that being the world's leader on lockdowns is neither socially sustainable nor a just way to treat fellow citizens. But, alas, I'm not that naive. It's about money. Pure and simple. As a nation, we have a habit every bit as addictive as the habits of many of the folk we've locked away. We've been addicted to the drug of incarceration, and now we can no longer afford our expensive habit. Things are ""breaking bad"" for us too. Time for rehab. Of course, like most addictions, this habit won't be easy to break. But let's hope this time around we get the help we need and come to our senses about how to better spend our dollars. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tavis Smiley.","Tavis Smiley: I'm underwhelmed at Holder's decision to avert mandatory minimum sentences .

"(CNN) -- We know the devastating force of Class 5 hurricanes, which have sustained winds exceeding 156 miles per hour (or 70 meters per second), like Hurricane Katrina. Now, imagine winds that are 2,000 times faster, stripping a galaxy of its future light and heat. Devastating doesn't begin to describe it. Data from the new Atacama Large Millimeter Array, a growing array of radio telescopes in the high desert of Chile, have mapped a ""superwind"" flowing out of a nearby galaxy. This galaxy, named NGC 253 (because it is the 253rd object in the New General Catalog of galaxies), is a bit like our own Milky Way galaxy in that it has a large disk of cold gas (atoms and molecules of matter) out of which stars are constantly forming. But NGC 253 is a galaxy on steroids: It is forming stars at about 100 times the rate of the Milky Way. That's why it's called a ""starburst"" galaxy. This made it a great target to observe with ALMA, which can see light from the gas from which those stars form. This light is not visible with the human eye. It's electromagnetic radiation like visible light but with a much longer wavelength. To observe it, we use radio telescopes, which look a lot like your basic satellite dish, only much bigger and more numerous. (Eventually, ALMA will consist of 66 dishes, each 40 feet in diameter.) Astronomers used ALMA to measure the amount of carbon monoxide molecules in NGC 253's superwind and to extrapolate the total amount of cold gas being blasted out of the galaxy. What's the big deal? Well, for the first time, the new ALMA analysis shows enough mass in this wind to carry away a large fraction of the gas in the galaxy. This suggests an answer to a longstanding mystery about why galaxies today do not have more stars. Let's delve more into this mystery by looking at galaxies grow. Over the 13.7 billion years since the Big Bang origin of the universe, familiar building blocks of matter -- electrons, protons and neutrons -- cooled and combined to form atoms. Then, as this gas cooled further, some of the atoms combined to form molecules. Meanwhile, gravity amplified regions of high density so stars and whole galaxies formed out of the cold, dense gas. But straightforward calculations describing this process tell us that today's galaxies should be filled with more stars, shining more brightly, than we see. Something must disrupt the ordinary, gravity-powered process of coalescence and star formation. What's missing? Cold gas. The new ALMA data show clearly that the gas from which those stars would form is being blown out of the galaxy. It's a funny kind of death by excess: The very high number of stars forming in NGC 253 generates a lot of heat, blowing winds off their surfaces, and these streams of heated stellar material unite to push away the surrounding gas that has not formed stars. When a superwind disrupts the gas clouds that might have formed more stars, we call it ""feedback,"" because if the star formation rate is very high, the superwind is strong, so a lot of gas is heated and/or ejected from the galaxy, so fewer stars form, and the superwind dies down. Conspicuous over-producers like NGC 253 are doomed, it seems, to cut off their own star production. Think of it as appetite control. Gravity has none. Gravity just keeps pulling on mass (particles, atoms, molecules, dark matter). If gravity were the only important effect, the clouds of gas would keep condensing and forming many more stars than we see. But the superwind keeps this from happening. Alberto Bolatto of the University of Maryland, who led the ALMA study of NGC 253, explained, ""For the first time, we can clearly see massive concentrations of cold molecular gas being jettisoned by expanding shells of intense pressure created by young stars. The amount of gas we measure gives us very convincing evidence that some growing galaxies blow out more gas than they take in, slowing star formation down to a crawl."" A talented science team was behind this result. But it wouldn't have been possible without the new ALMA telescope array, which was built by the U.S. National Science Foundation in partnership with Europe, Japan, Canada, Taiwan and the host country, Chile. ALMA is the largest ground-based astronomical project ever, taking more than 20 years from conception to operation and costing about $1.3 billion, with roughly one-third funded by the National Science Foundation. It is a model of international cooperation: Each partner supplied a share of the antennas, and an international organization oversees telescope operations. ALMA is sited in Chile because the Atacama Desert is ideal for millimeter astronomy. Its extreme dryness and high altitude -- about 16,500 feet above sea level -- mean greater atmospheric transparency to the high-frequency radio waves ALMA was designed to detect. (The wavelength of this light is about 1 millimeter, hence the ""M"" in the name.) People often debate the value of astronomy. It won't cure cancer or eradicate poverty. But it has its practical value, well beyond the primary goal of understanding how the present-day universe -- and our Earth, Solar System and Milky Way galaxy -- came to be. Astronomy pushes technology advancement. Those digital images you take with your camera or phone are possible because of tools that were developed for astronomy about 30 years ago. Think we need a work force better trained in science and technology? Astronomy gets kids -- and the curious inner kid in all of us -- interested in science. In Chile, astronomy is an important part of the high-tech economy. Could we live without knowing about the superwind in NGC 253? Sure. But, like art, astronomy is part of what enriches our lives. For some of us, learning where we came from is what it's all about.

"(CNN) -- There may still be doubts whether the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons against its own civilian population; but there is however conclusive evidence that it has effectively used the toxic stuff to poison the minds of western policy makers and paralyze the debate over intervention. This is so much so that it has diverted attention from what is happening on the ground in and focused it on the red line that the U.S. has drawn itself behind and seems unable to enforce. In the meantime, the massacres and destruction continues with impunity and the regime is triumphantly declaring victory over its opponents and gleefully celebrating the impotence of the United States. It all started in July last year with the Syrian regime itself throwing the cat among the pigeons by leaking information and acknowledging the existence of chemical weapons for the first time. This was followed by three messages by the Syrian foreign ministry's spokesperson: One was that the chemical weapons would not be used by the regime against its own population; two was an implication that the weapons would be used against an outside force while the third and most important message was that the regime was securing the weapons so that they do not fall into the hands of the rebels. This was enough in itself to trigger so many reactions in the west, especially in the US. First and foremost, it evoked the WMD debate over the justification of the Iraq invasion, the effect of that was to create for the Syrian regime a host of unwitting allies among those that were opposed to the Iraq invasion and against any further intervention. U.N. inspectors face enormous obstacles in Syria . The issue of chemical weapons became a debate about intervention which then triggered reassuring statements by the Obama administration that there was no intention of intervening in Syria except if the red line of using chemical weapons on civilians was crossed. These statements, in August 2012, unintentionally also resulted in reassuring the regime that it could carry on its suppression of the revolt with no fear of intervention as long as chemical weapons were not used. In May 2012, a couple of months before these statements, the deaths of 108 people in one day at Houla, according to the United Nations was considered as a massacre the repetition of which would warrant an intervention. The regime emerged from the episode with what it considered as a green light to continue with suppressing the revolt and the tolerance level was raised to an average casualty rate of between 100 and 200 every day, equal to or double that of Houla. If President Barack Obama's huffs and puffs are not convincing anymore, their credibility is further undermined by one of his top military men, General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who recently criticized the president for mentioning the red lines and the possibility of intervention. At the same time Gen. Dempsey was laying down military options so costly and long term that their net effect would further strengthen the hand of the anti-intervention lobby. But there was an even better message from the Pentagon for the Assad regime in November 2012: despite its opposition to intervention, the Pentagon indicated that it could lay down plans for intervention in Syria to secure the chemical weapons stockpiles ""to prevent them falling into the wrong hands"" should the regime lose control with the emerging chaos. One can imagine the relief in Damascus when this is interpreted as the U.S. and its military only worrying enough to think of intervention if and when the regime weakens and there is a possibility of its fall. The flipside of this means that the U.S. cannot see beyond the regime and that it would therefore prefer President Bashar al-Assad to stay. Recent comments by Gen. Dempsey about the opposition being incapable of taking over post al-Assad echo similar statements made last October by then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Better still, this meant that the green light and the licence to kill its own citizens and regain control of the country was still in effect no matter what public statements say; and now even that red line about the use of chemical weapons has all but lost its significance. The regime knows full well it can gain endless time by manipulating the mandates and bureaucratic arrangements of U.N. weapons inspectors. It is also further reassured by seeing the issue become part of party political rivalry. Chemical weapons are not the only tool in the regime's mind games with the West. In the summer of 2011, while teenage female bloggers and peaceful protesters were being arrested by the thousands, the regime released an estimated 1,500 Islamist prisoners from its jails including some connected to al Qaeda that it has a long experience in dealing with to create chaos in both Iraq and Lebanon. This manoeuver also bore fruit and wreaked havoc both on the ground and in the western debate over Syria, all this while the oil still flows to the regime's port of Tartus through territories held by those very Islamists that give a boost to the regime's narrative of fighting terrorism. Now that Syria is back on the international agenda, it may also be the time to re-evaluate what is happening there and look beyond the red herrings that the regime throws at us with the aim of diverting attention from its crimes. The cost of non-intervention is now alas too obvious to elaborate upon. After more than 100,000 dead, refugees and displaced in the millions and much of the country destroyed, the international community can no longer watch a regime killing its people and do nothing about it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nadim Shehadi.","The Syrian regime has poisoned the debate over intervention, writes Nadim Shehadi .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A top executive at AEG Live's parent company asked days before Michael Jackson's death if the singer was having big problems -- enough to warrant a straitjacket, according to testimony from Jackson's wrongful death trial. CNN obtained the video testimony played for jurors this week at the trial, which is in its seventh week in Los Angeles. ""Trouble with MJ. Big trouble,"" AEG CEO Tim Leiweke wrote to AEG Chief Financial Officer Dan Beckerman on the night of June 20, 2009. ""He is having a mental breakdown."" Beckerman, who became AEG's CEO after Leiweke left this year, replied: ""I figured something might be wrong given how jittery Randy has been this week. Is it 'pre-show nerves' bad or 'get a straight jacket/call our insurance carrier' bad?"" The reply was referring to AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips. On June 25, Jackson died from what a coroner ruled was an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol administered by Dr. Conrad Murray. Two weeks after that, Jackson's ""This Is It"" comeback tour, produced and promoted by AEG Live, had been set to launch in London. Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, the concert promotion branch of AEG, arguing the company is liable for his death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Murray. They say executives pressured Jackson to attend rehearsals despite his deteriorating health and ignored red flags that should have warned them about the dangers posed by Murray. AEG Live lawyers say that it was Jackson who chose and controlled Murray and that company executives had no way of knowing he was giving Jackson nightly infusions of propofol to treat his insomnia. The Leiweke-Beckerman e-mail exchange followed an ""intervention"" that Phillips held at Jackson's home to find out what was wrong with the singer, according to testimony. Leiweke forwarded to Beckerman an e-mail chain between Phillips, show director Kenny Ortega and others involved in the production. Production manager John ""Bugzee"" Houghdahl started the exchange about Jackson, which he titled ""trouble at the Front."" ""I have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks. He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now,"" Houghdahl wrote about Jackson. AEG's lawyer showed jurors a clip Thursday of Jackson performing several 360-degree spins while rehearsing his song ""Billie Jean."" It was not clear what day it was recorded. Ortega had sent Jackson home from a rehearsal the night of June 19, 2009 because of his strange behavior. ""He was a basket case and Kenny was concerned he would embarrass himself on stage, or worse yet -- get hurt,"" Houghdahl wrote. ""The company is rehearsing right now, but the DOUBT is pervasive."" Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle asked Leiweke during his deposition why he wrote to Beckerman that there was ""big trouble"" with Michael Jackson. ""We were aware that he had missed several rehearsals,"" Leiweke said. He said he couldn't remember if he was referring to Jackson or Phillips when he wrote to Beckerman that ""He is having a mental breakdown."" In a video of his deposition played for jurors, Beckerman said: ""I was just trying to understand: Is it stage fright and the show will go on, or is it, 'I can't go through this; I'm not going to step on stage'?"" Jackson stepped on stage just two more times in his life after that day. His rehearsals at the Staples Center on June 23 and 24 were filmed and became the basis for the ""This Is It"" documentary of his last months.","""He is having a mental breakdown,"" AEG Live CEO Tim Leiweke wrote .
CFO: ""Is it 'pre-show nerves' bad or 'get a straight jacket/call our insurance carrier' bad?""
At his deposition, Leiweke said he didn't know if ""breakdown"" referred to Jackson .

"(CNN) -- In 1961, my senior year in a rural Central Pennsylvania high school, I competed in the oratorical contest with a speech titled, ""The Plight of the American Negro."" My teacher informed me if I wanted to win, I had chosen a wrong and contentious topic. While I was raised in the North, attitudes about Negroes were similar to those in the South. From a relatively inactive movement in early 1960, dramatic events for racial equality captured national attention between 1961 and 1963 -- Freedom Rides, Interstate Commerce Commission's desegregation order, Voting Education Project, integration of the University of Mississippi, Gov. George Wallace's intervention against desegregating the University of Alabama, Dr. King's Letter from Birmingham Jail, national awareness of White Citizens Council and Ku Klux Klan brutality. When I arrived in the capital as a college student to take summer classes in 1963, I heard about a national demonstration planned at the Lincoln Memorial for late August. Washington was not only below the Mason Dixon line, but it was then in many ways a outhern city. Few blacks attended Washington's white colleges and universities. Black collegians attended Howard University. At my college, there were two black undergraduates, one of whom was from Africa. Job opportunities for non-college educated blacks were mostly in servile roles. College educated blacks were principally offered positions as teachers in colored public schools and ministers in colored churches. The Kennedy administration, fearing unrest, discouraged the demonstration. Lead organizers A. Philip Randolph and openly gay Bayard Rustin were not deterred. On Wednesday, August 28, 1963, I joined an estimated 250,000 black and some white Americans at the Lincoln Memorial for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. For me, it was important that I attend. Being a Jewish-American, the Holocaust was a recent and painful reminder of unfettered prejudice. Negro lynchings without arrests reminded me of the horror of the pogroms that Jews experienced in Europe, while authorities looked the other way. The March was a magical moment. Ordinary folks, mostly dressed as if they were going to church arrived from rural towns and large cities. Despite the repression exercised by authorities in the South, they were not intimidated. The magnitude of the largest crowd ever assembled on the National Mall inspired everyone. The statue of the Great Emancipator symbolized the long sought aspirations for a better life, equality and equal justice. It was a hot day with lots of speeches. While Dr. King is recognized today as America's preeminent civil rights leader, his numerous co-organizers also spoke that day. One was Rabbi Joachim Prinz, president of the American Jewish Congress. Jews were among the early white supporters of civil rights. Rabbi Prinz was a German Jew who emigrated to the U.S. to escape Nazi persecution. His speech lived up to his honored placement between Mahalia Jackson's spirituals and Dr. King's speech. When Dr. King began ""I Have a Dream,"" I was struck as if by lightning. It was akin to hearing Moses speak to the heavens. His speech was a defining moment for those assembled and for Americans watching television in living rooms across the nation. The March led to a Civil Rights Act of 1964 and a Voting Rights Act of 1965. In the late 1980s, I came out as a gay man and became increasingly involved in LGBT civil rights. I met Barbara Gittings and Frank Kameny, the mother and father of the LGBT civil rights movement. They helped organize the Annual Reminders at Independence Hall and Liberty Bell each July 4 from 1965 to 1969. The Annual Reminders, the first organized demonstrations for gay equality, laid the groundwork for the Stonewall Riots in 1969. While working on ""Gay Pioneers,"" a documentary to chronicle this history, I learned that the March on Washington had empowered early gay activists. They followed Dr. King's protocol of non-violence, decorum and picketing. It informed me of the March's pivotal impact on gay activism. Gay pioneer Jack Nichols stated, ""We had marched with Martin Luther King, seven of us from the Mattachine Society of Washington in 1963, and from that time on, we'd always had our dream about a (gay) march of similar proportions."" The first Annual Reminder on July 4, 1965, in Philadelphia had 40 participants. It was the largest demonstration for gay equality in the history of the world. By the 1969 Annual Reminder, the number swelled to 160 picketers. From 1979 to 1993, a series of national marches on Washington for lesbian and gay rights drew, at first, tens of thousands and later hundreds of thousands of people -- culminating in the April 1993 March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation that attracted an estimated 1 million demonstrators. In the years between the 1963 March on Washington and 1993, the AIDS epidemic and societal changes propelled by the African-American and women's civil rights movements helped launch LGBT from nascent to engaged activism. For me, the March 50 years ago was a transcendent moment in a lifelong engagement for everyone's civil rights. On August 28, 1963, Dr. King ascended a Mount Sinai. His biblical Dream forever changed institutional oppression, our nation and the world.

"(CNN) -- Just a few miles south of the Virginia state line, Mount Airy, North Carolina -- a former stagecoach stop along the Ararat River -- is thought to have inspired Mayberry, the fictional town where ""The Andy Griffith Show"" was supposedly set. By no coincidence, Mount Airy is also the birthplace of Andy Griffith, the actor who played Sheriff Andy Taylor in the series. Griffith died Tuesday at the age of 86 on North Carolina's Roanoke Island, his family said. But the actor's legacy in this small community, once propped up by a local economy fixed on textiles and tobacco, seems ever-present. ""We're the quintessential small town that lost all those things. Tourism has really saved us,"" said Tanya Jones, the executive director of the Surry Arts Council, a group that supports the region's local arts. ""Andy is the hook. He is the reason people come to Mount Airy,"" she said. ""We are devastated."" Officials, stars and fans react to the death of Andy Griffith . The region is also packed with many of the same landmarks that filled the actor's television story-lines. Mount Pilot, the fictional nearby town often referred to in ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" was likely a reference to Pilot Mountain, a state park and neighboring town of Mount Airy. Growing up in Mount Airy, Andy is part of your world . ""This is where he grew up,"" said Ronda Nunn, a waitress at Snappy Lunch, a restaurant built in 1923 that was also mentioned in the show. ""He put Mount Airy on the map."" The landmark eatery -- a favorite of fictional characters like Andy, Aunt Bee and Opie -- was filled Tuesday with local residents, arriving to talk about the news of Griffith's death and to pay their respects. ""We have a line as we speak out the front,"" said Diane Doss, 59, a Snappy Lunch employee for more than two decades. ""People would come visit here from everywhere,"" she said, adding that Griffith's star power also drew in big name celebrities like Oprah Winfrey. ""I once served eggs to Lou Ferrigno,"" Doss added, speaking of the actor who played The Incredible Hulk. ""Andy just really has meant a lot to this town"" and to those who came to it because of him, she said. Mount Airy -- with a population of about 10,000 -- is also home to the Andy Griffith Museum, a 1,500-square-foot building filled with memorabilia collected by the actor's friend, Emmett Forrest, whose name may have been used for Mayberry's handyman, Emmett Clark. The museum drew nearly 55,000 visitors in its first year after opening in 2009. Lifelong dream to visit Mayberry comes true . Best known for his role as the small town sheriff of Mayberry, Griffith later starred as a folksy southern attorney in the television legal drama, ""Matlock."" He also had roles on Broadway, in movies and was as a Grammy Award-winning gospel singer. Authorities say the former actor died on Roanoke Island, where he lived with his wife, Cindi. ""Andy was a person of incredibly strong Christian faith and was prepared for the day he would be called Home to his Lord,"" Cindi Griffith said in a statement Tuesday. ""He is the love of my life, my constant companion, my partner, and my best friend. I cannot imagine life without Andy, but I take comfort and strength in God's grace and in the knowledge that Andy is at peace and with God."" White House mourns the death of Andy Griffith .

"(CNN) -- Could it really be: Might Egypt end up exactly where it began? The decision by an Egyptian court to release former President Hosni Mubarak from prison and place him under house arrest for now adds to the impression that Egypt has come full circle, returning precisely to where it stood before the people toppled Mubarak, bringing an end to his 30-year-long dictatorship. It might seem that way, but that is the wrong conclusion. Egypt is a very different place from what it was before Mubarak fell. And after 2Â½ years of tumultuous upheaval, so, too, is the rest of the Middle East. To say the revolution has not gone as planned is to state the obvious. Mubarak's release is an important and rather disheartening symbol of the reverses faced by those who wanted to see dictatorship replaced by democracy. Since the last day Mubarak was president, Egypt has experienced the toppling of two regimes, a failed attempt at democracy, and an enormous amount of bloodshed. In the process, the country has learned many lessons. The innocence of 2011 is gone. There is a new maturity, a new realism. There's no sign of Jeffersonian democracy anywhere in the Arab Middle East, but there is a new notion that those who govern require the consent of the people before they can enjoy legitimacy in their position. A regime may be able to stay in power without that seal of popular acceptability, but it will be tagged as a dictatorship; it will remain unstable and hated. Its survival will constitute an affront to the dignity of the nation. No government wants to be seen that way. No citizen wants to be ruled that way. The Middle East may not look like what most people wanted it to, but it has been transformed. That's why before the Egyptian military moved in to remove Mohamed Morsy from the presidency, it made sure it had strong popular support. More people signed a petition calling for Morsy to step down than voted for him in the presidential election. Egypt is now governed by a prime minister handpicked by military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, but el-Sisi relies on public approval in a way Mubarak never did. The situation, to be sure, lends itself to dangerous populist manipulation and nobody would ever confuse the current structure with a democracy, but it includes important elements that could eventually produce a more democratic future. Even now, with the military in control, the notion that the people support the army is el-Sisi's greatest argument in defense of his position. The people have been empowered in a way they never were before. The mindset of those who lived under decades of dictatorship has been changed. Much else has changed. Since the intoxicating optimism of Tahrir Square, people have learned that revolutions are hard to control. The disastrous experiment under the Muslim Brotherhood-dominated government, the economic free fall and the violence Egyptians have endured have offered a stark lesson to Egypt and its neighbors. Those who would like to see more inclusive regimes, more democratic elements of government in other Middle Eastern countries, have watched Egypt. They have also watched the catastrophe that is befalling Syria. The revolutionary drive will now be tempered with cooler calculation. Reform won't come after a few weeks on the square chanting slogans for freedom. Perhaps reformers in Egypt would become more circumspect. True reform will require systematic, gradual plodding. Democracy requires more than elections. Democratic institutions and a democratic mindset must be developed before it can succeed. A foundation of consensus is needed. Another enormous change since the Mubarak days is the transformation of how people in the Middle East perceive key players in the region. The Muslim Brotherhood, for example, has not only lost power -- it also has seen its reputation deeply eroded. It has shown itself as incompetent and untrustworthy in the eyes of many. The Brotherhood's Morsy, elected with only 24% of eligible voters, behaved as if he had an overwhelming mandate. He tried to propel the Muslim Brotherhood's agenda, pushing a constitution written by his Brotherhood allies, appointing Brotherhood members to key positions, allowing an atmosphere of intimidation and persecution against non-Muslims, and trying to put himself above the law. As a result, his initially strong approval ratings fell steadily until millions took to the streets demanding his resignation. Before he was overthrown, 70% of Egyptians told pollsters they worried the Muslim Brotherhood was trying to ""Islamicize"" the country against their will. The Muslim Brotherhood has now been tested. It failed. That Egyptian experiment will reverberate in a time of turbulence. It's not only the Muslim Brotherhood whose image has changed. Syria's Bashar al-Assad was once viewed as a moderate, even a reformer. With more than 100,000 dead in that country's civil war, he is now viewed as a ruthless dictator, even if the popular uprising against him now includes many Islamist fighters, whose ideology is rejected by supporters of democratic change. The Arab uprisings, even if Mubarak becomes a free man again, have weakened other organizations. Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite group, has tarnished its name by joining the fight on Assad's side. Hamas, the Palestinian version of the Muslim Brotherhood, still has control of the Gaza strip, but it no longer enjoys the support of the bulk of the Egyptian public. It may look as if Mubarak is re-entering the same stage he left; as if nothing had changed. But the former Egyptian president is walking onto a changed world. The last two years have rerouted the course of history. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","A court in Egypt ordered the release of former president Hosni Mubarak from jail .
Frida Ghitis: Could it really be -- might Egypt end up exactly where it began?
She says there's a realization that legitimate rule requires consent of the people .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- The former wife of Nelson Mandela visited him Sunday in the hospital where the ailing anti-apartheid icon is clinging to life, the South African Press Association reported. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who was married to the former South African president from 1958 to 1996, described what it's like to see her former husband of 38 years struggle to live in an exclusive interview with UK network ITV News. ""It is extremely painful to see him going through what he's going through now. But it's God's wish,"" Winnie Mandela told ITV. Nelson Mandela, 94, remains in critical but stable condition at a Pretoria hospital where he has been battling a recurring lung infection since June 8. Opinion: In an African slum, talking to Mandela . His condition worsened last week with family members saying his health was ""delicate"" and ""anything is imminent."" But daughter Zindzi Mandela told ITV between hospital visits that her father is alert and recognizes when a new person enters his hospital room. ""The one time he did speak was to tell my mom to sit down ... because she was standing at the edge of his bed,"" she said, laughing. As his condition has deteriorated, South Africans have gathered outside the hospital, praying, lighting candles and leaving notes for the man they refer to as ""tata,"" the Xhosa word for father. Those tributes continued Sunday as a Salvation Army band played hymns near the hospital and well-wishers gathered to be close to their beloved Madiba. Winnie Mandela shot down any suggestion that the family was discussing whether to end life support. ""It was nonsense to suggest we needed to take a decision to pull the tubes,"" she told ITV. Obama challenges students to follow Mandela legacy . Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting against apartheid, the country's system of racial segregation. He was elected the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed. Even as he has faded from the spotlight, he remains popular and is considered a hero of democracy worldwide. The front page of South Africa's Sunday Times earlier this month carried the headline ""It's time to let him go,"" quoting a longtime friend of the former president as saying the time may have come for South Africans to say goodbye. ""Once the family releases him, the people of South Africa will follow. We will say thank you, God, you have given us this man, and we will release him too,"" friend Andrew Mlangeni told the paper. But Zindzi Mandela told ITV that what happens now is out of the family's hands. ""When people say the family must let go, and we say let go of what? In fact he is deciding what's happening with himself. It's between him and his maker. It's not to do with us whatsoever,"" she said. CNN's Faith Karimi and Samira Said contributed to this report.","Ex-wife Winnie Mandela says former husband's struggles are ""extremely painful"" to watch .

"(CNN) -- On Thursday, Google's much-discussed new privacy policy goes into effect. To say that the change has stirred concern on the Web would be an understatement. Public officials and Web watchdogs in the United States and elsewhere have expressed fears that it will mean less privacy for users of the Web giant's multitude of products, from search to Gmail to YouTube to Google Maps to smartphones powered by the Android operating system. Google points out that the products won't be collecting any more data about users than they were before. And, in fairness, the company has gone out of its way to prominently announce the product across all of its platforms for weeks. The major change is that, instead of profiling users separately on each of its sites and products, Google will now pull all of that information together into one single profile, similar to what's found on Google's dashboard page. The result encapsulates perhaps the most basic conundrum of the modern Web. More information means better service (and potentially, more targeted advertisements). But that service (in this case more accurate search results, more interesting ads and new features that work across multiple sites) requires you to give up some of your privacy in return. Federal Trade Commission Chairman Jon Leibowitz has called it ""a somewhat brutal choice."" Google, not surprisingly, takes a different tack: The payoff for the company collecting your data is cool new services. For example, they could push cooking videos to you on YouTube if you'd been looking for recipes through Google search, privacy director Alma Whitten wrote in an editorial for the Sacramento Bee. ""We just want to use the information you already trust us with to make your experience better,"" she wrote. ""If you don't think information sharing will improve your experience, you don't need to sign in to use services like Search, Maps and YouTube. ""If you are signed in, you can use our many privacy tools to do things like edit or turn off your search history, control the way Google tailors ads to your interests and browse the Web 'incognito' using Chrome."" Wednesday is the last day for people to tweak those Google settings before the new policy begins, although they can change them afterward as well. Here are a few tips on how to keep your data a little more private on some of Google's most popular features. Don't sign in . This is the easiest and most effective tip. Many of Google's services -- most notably search, YouTube and Maps -- don't require you to sign in to use them. If you're not logged in, via Gmail or Google+, for example, Google doesn't know who you are and can't add data to your profile. But to take a little more direct action ... Removing your Google search history . Eva Galperin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation has compiled a step-by-step guide to deleting and disabling your Web History, which includes the searches you've done and sites you've visited. It's pretty quick and easy: . -- Sign in to your Google account . -- Go to www.google.com/history . -- Click ""Remove all Web History"" -- Click ""OK"" As the EFF notes, deleting your history will not prevent Google from using the information internally. But it will limit the amount of time that it's fully accessible. After 18 months, the data will become anonymous again and won't be used as part of your profile. Six tips to protect your search privacy (from the EFF) Clearing your YouTube history . Similarly, users may want to remove their history on YouTube. That's also pretty quick and easy. -- Sign in on Google's main page . -- Click on ""YouTube"" in the toolbar at the top of the page . -- On the right of the page, click your user name and select ""Video Manager"" -- Click ""History"" on the left of the page and then ""Clear Viewing History"" -- Refresh the page and then click ""Pause Viewing History"" -- You can clear your searches on YouTube by going back and choosing ""Clear Search History"" and doing the same steps. Clearing your browsing history on Google Chrome . -- Click on the ""wrench"" icon at the far right of your toolbar . -- Select ""Tools"" -- Select ""Clear browsing data"" -- In the dialogue box that appears, click the ""clear browsing data"" box (there are other options you may want to use as well) -- Select ""Beginning of Time"" to clear your entire browsing history . -- Click ""clear browsing history"" Gmail Chat .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- The battle over Texas' attempts to change its law on abortion ran well into the night at the state capitol in Austin, with thousands milling around, all wanting to be heard during a public hearing. People representing both sides of the issue signed up to testify Tuesday at a House committee meeting on HB2, a bill that would impose strict new regulations on abortions in the state. The measure seeks to ban abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, mandate abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers, and require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing abortion services. Critics said the measure would shut down most abortion clinics in Texas, denying access to many, while proponents say it will raise the standard of care for women in Texas. It was a heated night and middle ground was hard to come by. Anti-abortion activists, all wearing blue shirts, joined together in shared prayer, telling stories of how abortions destroy lives. ""In 1979 I paid a registered physician $300 to kill my second child. I hated myself it almost destroyed me,"" Susan Collins said. Texas governor says 'no mob rule' in Legislature on abortion . Nearby, abortion rights activists, dressed in orange, tried to drown out their opponents with drumming, cheering, and chanting slogans about personal liberty. The opinions of many were summed up by a young woman who yelled, ""I'm (expletive) tired of men trying to tell me what I can and cannot do with my body!"" The initial House bill failed last week after a day and night of drama in which state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, talked for more than 10 hours in an attempt to run out the clock on the legislative session. But Gov. Rick Perry called a special session so the legislature could take up the measure again. Can Rick Perry overcome last presidential run? Almost 2,000 people signed up to speak for three minutes, but by the end of the night, fewer than 100 were able to share their thoughts with the committee. Registered nurse Vivian Femmy, who works at a pregnancy crisis center, said she supports the measure. ""I have been there on the front lines with the woman we are talking about today,"" she said. ""I am pro-choice, and I am pro-woman. I am pro-woman getting the kind of abortion care that is the finest care she can get. I support this bill because of what it will do to improve medical standards."" Elizabeth Grune arrived at the capitol at 8 a.m. and finally got her chance to speak at 6:45 p.m. ""Christians, we need the separation of church and state,"" she said. ""I don't believe in abortion but it is legal and as such all women deserve equal access."" The room used by the House committee filled almost immediately, and most people watched the proceedings in nine other rooms. One man who had been waiting to speak against the bill for hours angrily stormed out of the committee room when testimony was closed. ""My grandmother died from a back alley abortion!"" he shouted. Many abortions rights activists fear the legislation would restrict access to safe abortions and make women turn to more dangerous methods. Outside of the hearing room in an outdoor courtyard, it was prayer circles versus drum circles for more than eight hours. At the end of the night, with more than 1,000 people still waiting to testify, the bill cleared the committee with an 8-3 vote. The Texas Senate must now vote on the version of the bill in one of its committees before both bills can be brought to the full House and Senate floors. A final vote is expected next week.

"Washington (CNN) -- What will the Obamas get the royal wee one? Sources tell CNN they're planning a special gift but just what that will be is a topic of animated debate inside the White House and the State Department. Judging by the secrecy around the process, you'd think they were guarding state secrets. No baby buggy will do. The president and first lady must find a special gift to honor the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. Kate and William bring home royal baby boy . Presidents have a spotty history when it comes to giving gifts for the births of British royals. When Prince William was born in 1982, the Reagans gave him a child-size Chippendale-style corner chair with a needlepoint seat. But when his younger brother, Harry, was born two years later, they gave nothing. According to the Reagan Library, there was some criticism over the cost of William's chair, though it was less than $1,000, according to reports. Harry Truman was president when Prince Charles was born in 1948. The United States had recently fought World War II by Britain's side, but still all Harry and Bess sent to mark the occasion was a telegram. They received a polite reply in return. Photos: First look at royal baby . Calvin Coolidge did even less for the birth of the current queen in 1926: he sent nothing. So the pressure is on the Obamas to improve the record. Nancy Mitchell of the Washington Center for Protocol says a gift is meant to help in ""building or cementing relationships,"" and she believes the Obamas should send two: an official one from the American people and a personal one from them as a couple. Kate follows in Diana's footsteps . For the official gift she suggests a piece of moon rock because the new prince was born under the full moon; an American-made teddy bear, as the toy's namesake is Teddy Roosevelt; or a sapling from a great American tree to plant on palace property. Says Mitchell, ""Wouldn't it be lovely when the prince is 80 years old and King of the UK, and he looks out the window and says, 'This tree and I are the same age. This tree was presented by the United States the day I was born.'"" For a more personal gift from the Obamas, Mitchell would endorse American crafts such as a rocking chair or a quilt made of 50 squares, one for every state in the union. Prince George William Phillip Edward? Another option on her list: a hobby horse, though she emphasizes it must be made of American wood, from a tree ""that fell by natural causes. We don't want to be accused of chopping down a tree to make a gift for the prince."" She also suggests original art from the book ""Where the Wild Things Are,"" because both the president and first lady have said it's one of their favorite books, and Max, the main character, is crowned king in his fantasy. Just as important as what to give is what not to give. In this category: no political gifts, obviously, especially no ""silver spoons"" -- too many opportunities for puns. And Mitchell suggests no gender-specific gifts because the royals just went through the process of changing the rules of succession to allow for a female heir, so this wouldn't be the right time to highlight the fact that the heir is a boy rather than a girl. Finally, Mitchell says, ""I pray that the Obamas don't pop down to the gift shop of the White House ... I noticed there is a bib, a blanket, a onesie with the White House seal on it.""","Gifts for William and Catherine's baby must honor special U.S.-UK relationship .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, whose artwork is shown in museums around the world, is taking a different direction with his latest project -- a heavy metal album. Ai wrote and sang each of the nine tracks on the debut album, which is called ""Divina Commedia"" after a poem by Italian poet Dante, and will be released next month. ""The lyrics are about the current political situation,"" he told CNN by telephone from Beijing. One song is about Chen Guangcheng, the blind activist who fled to the U.S. embassy in Beijing after escaping from house arrest last year. Another mentions Wang Lijun, the police chief who also sought shelter with U.S. officials last year, in Chengdu, a move which exposed the scandal engulfing disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai and his wife, now convicted murderer, Gu Kailai. Ai Weiwei: Despite flaws, America should be proud . Outspoken and provocative, Ai is perhaps best known for his work on the famous ""Bird's Nest"" stadium built for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. His critical stance toward the Chinese government gained attention after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that left nearly 90,000 dead, including many children who died when their shoddily-constructed schools collapsed. A recent exhibition of his work at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC featured hundreds of children's backpacks lashed together in the shape of a snake, which Ai said represented the bags left behind by the students. While a departure from his acclaimed sculpture and installations, the album is not his first foray into the world of music -- last October he filmed a parody of ""Gangnam Style,"" the surprise worldwide hit by Korean rapper Psy. In that clip, Ai limited his musical involvement to dancing, but other clips can be found on the Internet of the artist flexing his vocal cords. Ai told CNN the decision to branch out into music stemmed from his detention in 2011 when his guards would ask him to sing a tune to pass the time. Ai was taken into custody in April and detained for 81 days amid a government crackdown on political activists. He was accused of evading a huge amount of taxes, charges Ai has said were trumped up. Ai was released but with heavy restrictions on his movements and the Chinese government still holds his passport. While Ai describes the tracks as ""heavy metal"" or ""hard rock"", it was an encounter with pop star Elton John that encouraged him to finally complete the album. John dedicated his performance in Beijing in November to Ai, who at the time said he was deeply touched by the gesture. Ai cited few musical influences and said he knew little about Western popular music despite a stint living in New York in the 1980s: ""When I grew up all the music we had was revolutionary stuff."" Ai said he would try to release the album in China next month, along with a music video, but he was gloomy about its prospects. ""I am completely censored,"" he said. ""I will put it online so people can download it but I think the authorities will just delete it.""","Dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei to debut a heavy metal album .

"(CNN) -- Doctors say there may be a glimmer of hope for a 12-year-old girl in Arkansas who is infected with a rare but deadly brain-eating parasite. Not a single person is known to have survived such an infection in the past decade, but Kali Hardig is hanging on in critical condition, according to doctors at Arkansas Children's Hospital. Hardig's mother took her to the hospital nine days ago. Hardig had a fever and a headache, but something else didn't seem right. Doctors checked her spinal fluid, and that's where they found a microscopic amoeba called Naegleria fowleri. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. It's usually found in people who have been swimming in warm, fresh water. You cannot be infected with the organism by drinking contaminated water, the CDC says. ""This infection is one of the most severe infections that we know of,"" Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC. ""Ninety-nine percent of people who get it die."" Why 'nightmare bacteria' on the rise . Dr. Sanjiv Pasala, one of Hardig's attending physicians, says they immediately started treating Hardig with an anti-fungal medicine, antibiotics and a new experimental anti-amoeba drug doctors got directly from the CDC. They have also reduced the girl's temperature to 93 degrees. Doctors have used that technique in some brain injury cases as a way to preserve undamaged brain tissue. Today, doctors checked the girl's cerebral spinal fluid and could not find any presence of the amoeba. Pasala said that while other cases have not met with such favorable results, what may have made a real difference is that the girl's mother got her to the hospital so quickly. Willow Springs Water Park in Little Rock is the most likely source of Hardig's infection, according to a news release from the Arkansas Department of Health. Another case of the same parasite, also called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, was reported in 2010 and was possibly linked to Willow Springs. ""Based on the occurrence of two cases of this rare infection in association with the same body of water and the unique features of the park, the ADH has asked the owner of Willow Springs to voluntarily close the water park to ensure the health and safety of the public,"" the news release said. What's in your pool water? The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the CDC. ""Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations,"" the government agency's website states. ""After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days."" Getting this amoeba is extremely rare. Between 2001 and 2010, there were 32 reported cases in the United States, the CDC says. Most of the cases occurred in the Southeast. Here are some tips from the CDC to help lower your risk of infection: . • Avoid swimming in freshwater when the water temperature is high and the water level is low. • Hold your nose shut or use nose clips. • Avoid stirring up the sediment while wading in shallow, warm freshwater areas. • If you are irrigating, flushing or rinsing your sinuses (for example, by using a neti pot), use water that has been distilled or sterilized.

Doctors say it is still too early to know whether Hardig can survive or to know how much of an impact the amoeba has had on the girl's brain.","Kali Hardig, 12, is in critical condition at Arkansas Children's Hospital .

"(CNN) -- Florida's effort to reunite families with the remains of their relatives believed to be buried on the grounds of a now-defunct reform school is being challenged by county officials. Commissioners in Jackson County, Florida, have filed a court motion to thwart the efforts of the state attorney general, who filed a motion earlier this month seeking the excavation of nameless graves on the grounds of the Dozier School for Boys in the Florida panhandle town of Marianna. It's yet another chapter in the long, sordid past of the reform school. Inmates sent there have told tales of brutal beatings, sexual assaults, murder and boys who simply disappeared. The graves, marked only by white tubular steel crosses, have been there since the early 1900s. Even though the graves are on state property, the county objects to the proposed exhumations because it said it has not been determined who will pay for the efforts of the county medical examiner, who would be directing the effort. In its circuit court filing, the county also said that notice has not been made to the family members of those who died. Glen Varnadoe has been one of the leaders in the effort to have the graves exhumed. He said his father and his uncle were sent to the reform school in 1934 after they allegedly stole a typewriter. Mystery surrounds graves at boys reform school . Thirty days later, he said, his uncle, Thomas Varnadoe, was buried on school property. Varnadoe said his father told him that they were regularly beaten during their time at the school. One night, his father said, he was awakened by guards who brought him to a freshly dug grave site in the woods, where school administrators told him that his brother had just been buried. He was only told that his brother died from pneumonia. Varnadoe said he simply wants his uncle's remains so he can bury him properly. And he said he is willing to file a civil action against Jackson County to make that happen. ""I'm angry, and I'm aggravated,"" Varnadoe said. ""I think they're going to be in for a tough fight."" ""Look how they buried these people,"" he said. ""If they want me to go away, then point me to Thomas Varnadoe's grave, and I'll have him disinterred and moved, and I'll leave these people alone."" CNN's calls to the Jackson County Commission went unanswered. For years, stories and allegations of beatings, torture and murder have surrounded the century-old school. State authorities have said in the past that there were 31 burial sites at the school, and a 2009 state investigation found no wrongdoing in connection with those deaths. The case of the unnamed, unmarked graves has gotten a large amount of public attention in recent months, after a research project by the University of South Florida uncovered evidence that about 50 bodies are buried beneath and around the 31 crosses that make up the cemetery in the middle of the woods on the school's property. In the wake of the university's findings, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, asked the Department of Justice to investigate. Earlier this week, Nelson toured the cemetery site. ""This is something that may be another part of our sordid past. This place was set up in the early 1900s and it was a different era back then when it came to civil rights,"" Nelson said. The mystery surrounding the graves first made headlines in 2008 when Florida's then-governor, Charlie Crist, ordered an investigation after a group of men, known as ""the White House Boys,"" came forward with stories of how they were beaten with leather straps by school administrators inside a small, white building on school property. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement's 2009 report said most of the 31 boys known to have been buried in the school's cemetery were killed in a 1914 fire at the facility, while others died in a 1918 flu outbreak. At the time, the law enforcement agency said it could not determine where another 50 boys, who it said died at the school as a result of illnesses or accidents, were buried, blaming poorly kept school records. FDLE closed the case due to the lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct, and no charges were filed. Investigators say the records do not explain why the boys were buried on school property in the first place. The boys who attended the school were considered ""young offenders"" of state law and were placed in the school in order to be ""separated from older more vicious associates,"" according to the 2009 report citing the Florida Children's Commission of 1953. Florida's Department of Juvenile Justice closed the school in 2011, blaming budget cuts. Glen Varnadoe is quite happy that the school is closed. He said he's spent a considerable amount of his own money trying to have the remains of his uncle returned to him and his family. ""I don't know why you'd want to try to prevent anyone from returning a loved one after having been buried the way they have been buried,"" he said. ""You tell me what their motive is.""","County officials want to block Florida from exhuming graves at a former reform school .

"YENEGOA, Nigeria (CNN) -- The crowd of young men gathered around as police officers unloaded a small arsenal from the bed of a truck: buckets of bullets, boxes and boxes of machine guns and rocket launchers. Militant commander Ebikabowei ""Boyloaf"" Ben has pledged commitment to dialogue. The scene played out to cheers over the weekend as 1,000 militants and their commanders in the oil-rich Niger Delta region laid down their arms in exchange for a government amnesty program that promises them a pardon and a job. The program has been in place since August 6. The government held up Saturday's public surrender of weapons -- the biggest so far -- as a sign that it was proceeding successfully. It hopes that, before the program runs its course on October 4, it will earn the cooperation of thousands of other armed groups that have cut Nigeria's oil production in the region to its lowest levels since 1999. But missing from the amnesty ranks is the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), an umbrella organization for many of the armed groups. It has declared the drive a charade and accused the government of purchasing the weapons. ""In the midst of such sheer deceit, MEND will be compelled to resume with ferocious attacks on the oil industry at the end of our cease-fire on September 15, 2009,"" the group said Saturday. MEND had declared a 60-day truce in July following the release of its leader as part of a separate amnesty deal with the government. Before the current amnesty offer, Nigeria military had been clearing the western Niger Delta region in a major operation against armed groups, specifically MEND. The armed militant groups demand that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be reinvested in the region instead of enriching those whom they consider corrupt politicians. They have destroyed several oil facilities, forcing Nigeria to cut its oil exports by as many as 1 million barrels of oil per day, or 40 percent. The recent violence -- which has included attacks on pipelines and hostage-taking -- has limited shipment of crude oil supplies out of Nigeria, Africa's largest producer. ""As we lay down our arms today, the struggle continues,"" Ebikabowei ""Boyloaf"" Ben, a top militant commander, said on Saturday. ""But this time, it will be constructive negotiations and dialogue, which we believe is the way forward.""  Watch former rebels celebrate amnesty » . The amnesty is the first step to bring peace to the region, the government says. Oil accounts for 80 percent of Nigeria's budget revenue. The amnesty will allow oil to flow again and development to begin, officials hope. ""Before now, the promises may not have been well meant. But this time we believe the promises are well meant,"" said Timipre Sylva, the governor of Bayelsa state, where the weapons surrender took place. Lucky Ararile, the chief coordinator of Amnesty Implementation Committee, urged militants to take up the offer. ""If they don't accept amnesty, the law will take its course,"" he said. Many of the young men at the ceremony had spent their entire lives living and fighting in the rivers and creeks of the Niger Delta. The key to stop them from picking up their guns again is work, they said. ""We are jobless. That's why we did the militant game. So all we need is jobs,"" Mayus Bayolou said. The details of the rehabilitation and development programs promised for those accepting the amnesty remain unclear. Militant leader ""Boyloaf"" Ben said he will now try to find a legitimate business, but warns of dire consequences if the government reneges. ""I believe the next generation to come will do things more bloody than we have,"" he said.","Militants and commanders in oil-rich Niger Delta region join amnesty program .

"(CNN) -- As Bradley Manning thinks about his 35-year prison sentence, he likely may be contemplating the availability of treatment for his gender identity disorder while in federal custody. Prisoners with GID are hardly a new phenomenon. Many prisoners before Manning have legally sought the right to become the gender they believe they should be through various means: cross-gender hormones, cross-dressing, and sex-reassignment surgery. The question with prisoners becomes whether the state must provide the desired hormones or sex-reassignment surgery. The United States Supreme Court has held that prisoners are entitled to medical care that meets minimal standards of adequacy. But when prison officials refuse to provide certain medical services, a prisoner must establish that state officials are deliberately indifferent to ""serious medical needs"" and therefore are in violation of the Eighth Amendment's ban against ""cruel and unusual punishment."" The application of the Eighth Amendment to prisoners is a relatively new concept. The Supreme Court first addressed the issue in 1976, but in doing so established that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the ""unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,"" which is covered by the Eighth Amendment's proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. So what constitutes ""serious medical needs""? Courts have held that these can be conditions diagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment. However, courts have also held that the prisoner need not receive ""ideal care"" or ""the care of his choice."" Instead, prison officials have some authority to choose among different treatments. The issue with GID then becomes this: Is it possible that the only appropriate medical treatment for patients (prisoners and civilians alike) with GID is either hormone therapy, or, more drastically, sex-reassignment surgery? Generally, if a treatment is ""medically necessary,"" it will be provided to prisoners. Several medical authorities have stated that in some cases, sex-reassignment surgery is a ""medically necessary"" treatment for some individuals with GID. Medical authorities say that severe emotional distress is the result of untreated GID. That distress can lead to self-mutilation and possibly suicide. Certainly some members of the public will ask the question: ""Isn't prison supposed to be unpleasant?"" Even more ardent opponents might pose the hypothetical: ""If medicine recognizes 'prison-a-phobia' (a fear of incarceration), and the only accepted treatment is release from prison, is an afflicted prisoner constitutionally entitled to release from prison, as medically necessary treatment to which he is entitled?"" One could also argue that such arguments stretch the logic to an absurd -- and inapplicable -- extreme. For prisoners who claim they are entitled to either surgery or hormone treatment under the Eighth Amendment, the issue is even thornier: Does a failure to provide cross-gender hormones or sex-reassignment surgery constitute deliberate indifference to a serious medical need? If so, prisoners could be constitutionally entitled to either or both. In 2012, a federal district court in Massachusetts held, in a groundbreaking opinion, that prison officials violated the Eighth Amendment by refusing to provide a prisoner sex-reassignment surgery. Even more fascinating, in the same case, Kosilek v. Spencer, the state was already providing feminizing hormones to the prisoner, but the court deemed this constitutionally inadequate treatment. How did the federal court arrive at this decision? First, it reviewed medical literature, which provided that, in certain cases, sex-reassignment surgery is the only treatment for GID. That literature included the World Professional Association for Transgender Health's ""Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People."" Those standards provide that in persons with profound GID, ""sex reassignment surgery ... is medically indicated and medically necessary."" The standards also provide that such surgery is not ""elective"" or ""optional"" in any meaningful sense. Once the court established that medical necessity, there was little to prevent prisoner Michelle (formerly Robert) Kosilek from making his case. The court concluded that Kosilek had a serious medical need; that sex reassignment surgery was the only adequate treatment for it; and that the Department of Corrections was aware of his ""suffering serious harm ... if not provided such surgery."" By this logic, Kosilek successfully established an Eighth Amendment violation, and the court ordered his sex-reassignment surgery ""forthwith"" -- legalese for ""right away."" Courts since Kosilek have arrived at different conclusions. Society may ultimately reject this logic in the case of prisoners. For example, a prisoner with appendicitis would be entitled to a ""medically necessary"" appendectomy. Why? Because the consequences of this appendicitis, left untreated, include a very real risk of death. There is no risk of death, or even serious bodily harm (other than self-inflicted) in the case of untreated GID. The benefits are largely mental, emotional, and/or spiritual, and that's why it will be unpopular: Most civilians may not consider the peace of mind of our nation's incarcerated criminals -- at the cost of their tax dollars -- ""medically necessary."" So what will Bradley Manning's options be? Will he be entitled to sexual hormone therapy, or sex-reassignment surgery? Will he have the right to have the federal government (i.e., taxpayers) fund this treatment? The answer will turn on whether federal courts will choose to follow the logic of the Kosilek court, and hold that the government's refusal to allow and pay for sex-reassignment surgery for prisoners with GID constitutes ""cruel and unusual punishment."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Danny Cevallos.","Danny Cevallos: Bradley Manning case may test law on gender identity change in prison .

"(CNN) -- Much has been made in recent years about America's growing gap between rich and poor. I'm sure you feel beaten over the head with statistics comparing the struggling 99% with the top 1% of earners, those chosen few whose economic and political clout of rich few has increased to levels not seen since the Great Depression. So I'll spare you the stats and simply ask one question that's not considered nearly often enough in the post-Occupy era: Is America's current income distribution fair? Forget about how we got here. Forget the Wall Street suits and the cardboard-holding protesters. Obama and Romney. Bloomberg and Buffett. Pretty much delete 2007 to 2013 from your brain. Is the system fair? And what information do you need in order to decide? For intellectual guidance, I'm turning to the work of the late philosopher John Rawls, whose 1971 book ""A Theory of Justice"" was written about eight years before this rich-poor gap in the United States started to widen. Rawls argues, in a roundabout way, that a society is unfair if its citizens would not agree to be randomly reassigned to another income class. Michael Norton, an associate professor at Harvard, explained it to me this way: Imagine you're moving to a new country, but when you do, you will randomly be assigned to any income level that currently exists in that society. Would you move? If so, it's fair. If not? Well ... This idea is great as far as thought experiments go, but how should I know whether I would make that gamble? Like most Americans, I tend to come into contact with people who are very much like me, economically at least. Most of my friends have gone to college. Many hold jobs in highly skilled industries. There's a range, and I do live in a neighborhood with a serious homelessness problem, but I don't engage the full spectrum of modern American wealth -- from the very poor to the extremely rich -- in my day to day life, and I bet that you don't either, if you're honest. It's hard to assess the state of inequality if it's partly invisible. Would I play that John Rawls lottery? I'm not sure. So I'm going to test this theory in real life. And I'm going to call it the Rawls Test, named for the philosopher whose work inspired this journey. This week, I'll be going to an undisclosed location, which happens to be the most unequal place* in America. I'm going to meet people from all five income brackets, spend time with them, trying to get a real understanding of the economic challenges they face. Step away from the statistics. And then I'll decide: Is this the America I want to live in? Do you? Does everyone in this country have a more or less equal chance of success if they work hard and want to get ahead, as politicians from both parties argue they should? Consider this a referendum not on this undisclosed place but on inequality in America writ large. The Rawls Test and the stories that will follow originated with you. This summer, I asked readers of this column to vote on five stories you wanted me to cover as part of the Change the List project. Income inequality was the top pick, with 16,789 of 32,546 voters putting this issue in their top five. This test is just the start of a big conversation on the topic. I invite you to follow the journey on a Tumblr called ""Rawls Test,"" or on Twitter. I'll be tweeting with the hashtag #rawlstest. If you have questions about the project or for the people I encounter, please ask. At the end of the experiment, I'll ask you to consider this fairness question with me. Then, if needed, we can get into the messy details about what would make our society better. Until then, think about the Rawlsian lottery and whether you might play it. And wish me luck! *Data note: There are many ways to measure the ""most unequal place"" in the United States. By one measure, which I'm not disclosing for fear of giving away the location, I'm in the most unequal place in the country. By others, I could be in New York. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Income inequality will be the focus of the next Change the List story .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched a major review of the country's defense strategy on Wednesday, as the embattled regional power tries to adapt to a post-Arab Spring world. Netanyahu took the rare step of summoning the entire Cabinet to discuss the new five-year strategy, his office said. ""We must be ready for the changing threats that are being directed at the State of Israel,"" he told ministers as the meeting began, according to the statement from his office. ""We must see to it that the security which Israelis have enjoyed over past three-and-a-half years continues under the changing conditions."" The toppling of Egypt's long-time President Hosni Mubarak last year destabilized Israel's southern border, while the civil war in Syria could affect its northern frontier. Egypt has been struggling to clamp down on militants in the Sinai desert, which borders Israel. An increased defense budget is needed to counter new threats all around the country, a former Israel Defense Forces deputy chief of staff said Wednesday. ""The Muslim Brotherhood is forming a ring around Israel, out of Sinai and other places so with all this we need more money for the home front,"" said the retired officer, Uzi Dayan. If the Sinai is not demilitarized, it becomes a new front, Dayan said. Syria could become a Sunni Muslim state if secular dictator Bashar al-Assad is forced out, he added. ""If ... weapons from there get into the hands of terror organizations, this is a threat,"" he said, as is the ongoing possibility of missiles from Lebanon and Gaza. ""In the long run the Americans are leaving Iraq, leaving Afghanistan, so there is new pressure from the east. So these are the new threats -- not to mention the main threat posed by Iran,"" he said. The government review will affect the defense budget starting next year, Netanyahu said. It is not expected to be completed in a single day, he added.","PM Benjamin Netanyahu launches a rare full-Cabinet review of defense spending .

"(CNN) -- There is little about the horror that unfolded in a dark Aurora, Colorado, movie theater that Eugene Han and Kirstin Davis can forget. There's the sound of the gunfire, of the screams, of the chaos that followed as accused gunman James Holmes opened fire in a rampage that left 12 people dead and 58 wounded, among them Han and Davis. One year later, the couple are taking back THAT day, replacing the fear they felt with the love they have for one another, when they marry on Saturday -- a year to the day of the shooting rampage . ""My thought process was that everyone has a date that they want to get married on that means something special to them,"" Han said Thursday on CNN's Piers Morgan Live. ""For us, it was a night of terror and all that. So we wanted to change the date and, you know, make it our own."" Surviving THAT night . It's an ending for the couple that almost wasn't. THAT night, July 20, 2012, Han and Davis were on a date to see the midnight screening of the new Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The two had known each other for years, having gone to elementary school together. But now, in this theater, they were a young couple, enjoying one another and the possibilities of their relationship. Then, according to authorities, a heavily-armed Holmes walked through the emergency exit door and into the dark theater. ""When James Holmes walked in that night, I knew something was going to happen because no one really walks through an exit door -- especially through an exit door,"" Han said. Maybe it was the warning his parents had given him as a child: Be aware of your surroundings. Maybe it was instinct. But in that moment, when the gunman opened fire, Han dropped from his seat to the floor. When he looked over for Davis, he saw she was still in her seat. He reached up and pulled her down on to ground. ""So I made sure that James Holmes couldn't get to her. If anything, at least, put my body between her and the shooter,"" he said. The bullets ""went through chairs like butter,"" hitting Han in the hip and the knee. Davis suffered minor injuries, cuts and scrapes. For months, as Han underwent medical care, Davis was by his side. Their bond, they say, strengthened. Setting the date . The marriage proposal came months later, in a private moment as the couple vacationed in Texas. Later, Han thought about the year and all that they had endured. Today, Han can run and walk. But he also carries a constant reminder of THAT day -- shrapnel in his hip. As they drove back to Colorado, Han asked Davis if she wanted to get married on THAT day. ""I kind of scared her at first, and she had to think about it,"" he said. She, too, thought about all they had gone through. She thought about how he saved her. She thought about how she could have lost him. Her answer: Yes. Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1964, the year Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the Civil Rights Act was passed in the United States, and Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life in prison. Mine was a relatively idyllic childhood in the affluent and segregated northern suburbs of Johannesburg. Like many white South Africans, I lived in an ignorant cocoon of privilege, with no idea that having two live-in maids, a full-time gardener and a driver was unusual. It was perfectly normal for my African nannies, Rosina and Phina, to live with us rather than with their own children, and there was no need to learn their language or even their last names. It was only as a teenager that I began to realize something was horribly wrong. Phina and I were walking along the road of our pristine ""whites only"" neighborhood when we saw a police van stop. Two armed white police officers got out and began interrogating the black passers by. They roughly shoved several of them into their van, screaming obscenities all the time. I was terrified and asked Phina what was going on. She explained that the police were on a ""pass"" raid, and any black person in a white suburb without an identity book stamped with official permission to live and work in Johannesburg was a criminal and liable to arrest. From that day on I was no longer innocent to the evils of apartheid. A teacher in my segregated public elementary believed in schooling her privileged white students in the injustices happening all around them. Suddenly Phina and Rosina became real people to me, and I learned for the first time about Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress. Songs like ""Free Nelson Mandela"" became part of our consciousness, but Mandela himself was still a mythical figure: the blanket of South African government censorship, which made it a crime to publish the words of prohibited leaders and organizations, or to write about the South African Security Forces or prison conditions, kept us in relative ignorance. The Soweto riots happened on June 16, 1976. Police shot into huge crowds of schoolchildren of all ages protesting a directive they could not be taught in their own language. Hundreds of people were killed; the cruelty and brutality of the government's reaction was met with rioting that spread to other townships. It was the beginning of the end of colonial, racist South Africa. The shooting death of 13-year-old Hector Peterson galvanized the world. Yet we knew little about it, even though Soweto was less than 20 miles away. In high school, history teacher Mr. Lowry, who had been arrested several times for anti-apartheid activism, insisted we wear black armbands every June 16th. We complied. But it was only in April 1994, in my late 20s and standing for hours in a long line of black and white South Africans to vote in the country's first democratic election, that I came close to truly understanding the unforgivable nature of apartheid. Next to me was a dignified 75-year-old man who had taken two buses and walked 10 miles to the voting station to vote for the first time in his life. On my other side was Salaminah, the lady who was helping raise my children, and who had become an integral part of our lives. Only now, at the age of 55, was she considered a real citizen in the place where she and her ancestors had lived for hundreds of years. We whites had lived in a place that denied people their basic human rights. Why had it taken so long to change this inhumane system? How had we allowed it? I stood in that line experiencing a mixture of jubilation and guilt. Had I really lived for 29 years in a country that had denied the majority of its people the right to vote? It was also a time to truly appreciate the enormous sacrifice and achievement of Nelson Mandela and his comrades. Mandela's release from prison in February 1990 had been both a highly anticipated and enormously feared event. Many members of the white South African minority were terrified of the kind of displacement and retribution that has historically followed revolutions and major changes in government. So you can imagine everyone's relief when, rather than calling for a revolution, Mandela instead preached reconciliation, and spoke of a Rainbow Nation and the importance of Ubuntu -- we are human through the humanity of others. It was then that the brilliance of Mandela as a peacemaker, a politician and a statesman emerged. To really understand the psyche of Mandela is to grasp his profound lack of bitterness, a quality that is almost inhuman for a man who spent 27 years as a prisoner of the South African government. It seems Mandela consciously cultivated that quality. He wrote: ""As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn't leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I'd still be in prison."" As chronicled in the Clint Eastwood movie ""Invictus,"" this is a man who donned a green rugby jersey during the Rugby World Cup in 1995 to send a message to racist white South African rugby players and fans that everyone in the ""Rainbow Nation"" of the new South Africa would be rooting for their victory. This is a man who in 1995 visited Betsie Verwoed, the 94-year-old widow of one of the prime architects of apartheid, and a man who invited his white jailor as a VIP guest to his inauguration as the country's first black president. I first met Mandela at a business awards gathering. The second time was at the opening of the SOS children's village in Cape Town where he presided as guest of honor. He was charming, talking to me about my job while holding my hand. He was still extremely energetic at 79 and very handsome. His only ailment was watery eyes, the result of 13 years spent doing hard labor at the limestone quarry on Robben Island, where he spent 18 years of his 27 years of imprisonment in a small cell. I also met the president at the Mandela House in Johannesburg when he greeted the Manchester United soccer team, who were visiting South Africa. It was amazing to see these superstar athletes awestruck at being in the presence of the most famous politician of this generation. It was 1997, and the transformation of the country's psyche was palpable. We were no longer the pariahs of the world, and suddenly Mandela had lifted South Africa from disgrace to worldwide acceptance and applause. He had done so gracefully and relatively peacefully. That is probably why nearly everyone introduced to Mandela would tear up, so moved were they by his stature and accomplishments. Mandela's family suffered. His daughters Zenani and Zindzi and their mother Winnie were exiled to Brandfort, a town hundreds of miles away from Johannesburg. They grew up without their father, sleeping on the floor. Mandela lost three of his six children, one of whom died while he was in prison. In June of 2010, his beloved great-granddaughter Zenii was killed in a car accident at the start of the World Cup Soccer Tournament. Now, at 94, nearly 95, like most mortals in their twilight years, Mandela is frail, and in the hospital yet again, in serious condition. All this is not to say that Mandela's emphasis on facilitating a peaceful transition of power in South Africa has not been criticized. Many believed, and still do, that Mandela was too conciliatory and that too little was done to transform the South African economy. Indeed, to a large extent, economic power still remains mainly in the hands of whites and a small black elite. The country is grappling with enormous problems, including high unemployment and growing corruption. Indeed, the new South Africa that owes its relative peace and prosperity to the transformative vision of Nelson Mandela is still a work in progress. But, whatever the future brings for the Rainbow Nation, Mandela will always be the man who turned a nightmare into a vision, a vision into a dream and a dream into a reality.

"(CNN) -- One of the men taken into custody in connection with the suspected kidnapping of a 2-year-old boy and a double homicide in Rhode Island was arraigned Monday, police said. He is Daniel Rodriguez. The initial suspect in the case, Malcolm Crowell, has been released and there are no plans to charge him, according to Johnston Police Chief Richard Tamburini. An Amber Alert was issued for the boy on Sunday and he was found wandering the streets of Providence. The mother and daughter, Evelyn Burgos, 40, and Vanessa Perez, 25, both were shot to death, officials said. Police said Crowell helped police recover the boy, who Tamburini said is Burgos' son. Police now list the boy's name as Isaiah. Earlier, his first name was listed as Isaih. The child appeared to be in good health when checked out at a hospital, Johnston Police Deputy Chief Daniel Parrillo said. ""A patrolman found him while on patrol just walking on the sidewalk,"" he said. Police now say Crowell, 22, was helpful in the recovery of the child.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Covering the trial of Bo Xilai, a man once tipped to rise to the summit of Chinese politics, reminded me of the time I reported on a similarly explosive story in the early 1980s -- the trial of the so-called ""Gang of Four"" in China. This notorious group was led by Jiang Qing, Mao Zedong's widow, and three of her ideological allies. A former movie starlet, Jiang Qing rose to the top tier of the Communist Party leadership thanks mainly to her close ties with the ""Great Helmsman,"" the architect of the infamous Cultural Revolution, a campaign to enforce Communism that led to the persecution of millions of people. But a month after Chairman Mao's death in 1976, the four, together with their associates, were arrested and charged with ""heinous"" crimes, including plotting to assassinate Mao and attempting to pull off an armed rebellion. It took more than four years to bring them to trial. For China watchers, it was worth the wait. It turned out to be China's ""trial of the century,"" replete with political intrigue, drama and endlessly memorable quotes. ""Attacking the Ghosts of Mao,"" read the headline of one of our Newsweek magazine stories published in January 1981. It was the first major story I covered as a foreign correspondent in China. Controlled coverage . ""Covered"" is a misnomer. More than 600 people -- mostly government officials, representatives from the public, relatives of defendants and trusted Chinese reporters -- were allowed in court, by invitation only. Foreign journalists like me need not apply, I was told. Nevertheless the trial turned into a huge story, covered extensively in and outside China. At that stage, China was just emerging from the dark clouds of the totalitarian Maoist era. The political system was opaque and the media was severely controlled. To our surprise, however, the Chinese newspapers, radio and TV were saturated with ""gavel to gavel"" reports, as a fellow reporter put it. The trial dragged on for nearly two months. We relied largely on officially vetted accounts and rare TV footage, aware the authorities had allowed extensive but filtered coverage not for the sake of transparency but to demonize the defendants and legitimize their incarceration. I remember spending many nights watching CCTV's extensive excerpts of the court proceedings with Chinese friends and fellow reporters. We spent as much time parsing what actually took place inside the courtroom, then reached out to unofficial sources to find out what was actually left out of the official narrative. Much like events in Jinan this week, the Gang of Four trial took a melodramatic turn as it winded down. During the televised coverage, the former actress feistily defended herself against charges of treason by claiming that everything she did had Mao's approval. ""I was Chairman Mao's dog,"" Jiang Qing shouted at the panel of judges. ""Whomever he told me to bite, I bit."" In her final speech, that lasted for about two hours, the 66 year old said she was ""prepared to die"" fighting for her husband and leader. In early 1981, Madame Mao, as she became known, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, later commuted to life imprisonment. But several years later, she committed suicide while under house arrest. Transparent or not? Watching the Bo trial this week, I wondered what has changed and what has not since Jiang Qing's trial three decades ago. ""This was an open process for China, giving Bo the chance to challenge his accusers and present his own case so publicly,"" said David Zweig, a professor at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ""It has been great drama. This is no Stalinist trial."" True, the five-day trial turned out to be more interesting and substantive. I had expected a brief and heavily scripted political ""show trial."" But Bo the accused was given ample time to speak out and cross-examine adversarial witnesses. For that Bo himself credited and thanked court officials, especially the chief judge. ""The judge is a professional with a law degree, not like (Gang of Four trial chief judge) Jiang Hua, who was a Long March-era cadre,"" said Chinese film producer Li Weijia. ""Also, Bo had defense lawyers, who I understand were picked by Bo and his family. This could not have happened during the trial of the Gang of Four."" The Chinese authorities hailed this as an ""open and public trial,"" posting photos, video clips and excerpts from court transcripts on the court's Twitter-like Sina weibo account. ""It's a major breakthrough,"" claimed political analyst Victor Gao. ""It demonstrates the government's eagerness to show they have nothing to hide from the public about the trial. It helps enhance transparency and may bode well for greater political reform and judiciary reform."" Filtered truth . But other observers say the court proceeding was only partially open, noting that the court's micro-blog was tightly vetted. ""I think we are clearly still getting a filtered truth,"" said Donald Clarke, a professor at The George Washington University Law School in the United States. ""The Weibo transcripts are not complete."" Clarke noted that the transcripts released on the first day were more copious than those released on the second and subsequent days. ""So it seems like somebody somewhere decided to release less information,"" he explained. ""It is inconceivable to me that somebody pretty senior in the propaganda apparatus is not making decisions about what to put in the publicly released transcripts."" With only 19 ""trusted"" Chinese journalists allowed into the courtroom, we again had to seek out other sources of information to fill in the blanks and cross-check the court's micro-blogs. The official narrative left out parts that may put Bo in good light, two people with knowledge of the proceedings told CNN. At the closing session on Monday, sources said, Bo spoke for nearly half an hour, much longer than the court transcripts suggested. Bo explained he was retracting his signed confessions because he made them under ""severe pressure"" during the 17 months he was detained and repeatedly interrogated. After he spoke, Bo's five family members stood up, clapping and saying: ""Well put, Xilai! We will always stand by you."" While we could not get the whole truth from the micro-blog, Li Weijia suggested the trial offered some hope. ""We could get a sense of what was going on inside the courtroom, especially when Bo said 'no' to some of the charges in front of the judge and his relatives."" Business as usual . Yet some things have not changed, even with the significant progress China has made in reforming its legal system in recent years. In 1981, for instance, the Chinese court nonchalantly billed the landmark judicial process as ""The Trial of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing Counter-Revolutionary Cliques"" -- pronouncing the defendants guilty of ""counter-revolution"" even before the trial. Three decades later today, there is still no presumption of innocence at a trial. Holding a trial typically presumes guilt, because a preliminary investigation is supposed to have already determined that before going to trial. In Bo's case, observers say President Xi Jinping's new administration will be treading carefully. ""They want to win the case whereby Bo Xilai will be disgraced for the rest of his life so that he will never have a realistic chance to make a political comeback,"" said Gao. ""But they see no incentive in having 'blood' on their hands. They just want a quick and effective way to dispose of this case and turn a new page."" The court is expected to hand down a guilty verdict. ""Leniency to those who confess, severity to those who resist,"" goes the guiding principle of China's socialist legal system. Given Bo's defiance and refusal to confess, it seems the only question worth pondering is about how severe the sentence will be.","The so-called ""Gang of Four"" was led by Jiang Qing, Mao Zedong's widow .

"(CNN) -- British authorities have charged a veteran children's television host with more than a dozen counts of child abuse stemming from an ongoing investigation into another TV personality. Australian-born Rolf Harris was charged with nine counts of indecent assault dating to 1980, the Crown Prosecution Service announced Thursday. Another four counts accuse Harris of making indecent images of children in 2012, when he was first questioned by police. Harris, now 83, hosted children's shows and a painting program on Australian and British networks and painted a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II for the monarch's 80th birthday in 2005. He was arrested as part of the long-running Operation Yewtree, the investigation set up after a documentary leveled allegations of sexual abuse against now-deceased ""Top of the Pops"" and ""Jim'll Fix It"" host Jimmy Savile. ""Having completed our review, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest for Mr. Harris to be charged with nine counts of indecent assault and four of making indecent images of a child,"" Alison Saunders, chief prosecutor for London, said in a statement announcing the charges. ""The alleged indecent assaults date from 1980 to 1986 and relate to two complainants aged 14 and 15 at the time of the alleged offending."" Harris had been released on bail after his initial arrest in March. He's scheduled to appear in court on the charges September 23, prosecutors said. Operation Yewtree was launched after an ITV documentary in October led to a flood of allegations against Savile, who had been seen as an eccentric but charismatic man who raised millions of pounds for charity. The claims stretched from 1955 to 2009. Savile died in 2011 at age 84.","Rolf Harris faces 13 counts, some of which date to 1980 .

"(CNN) -- A farm linked to the recent outbreak of cyclospora has stopped sending lettuce to the United States, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Taylor Farms de Mexico ""voluntarily suspended production and shipment of any salad mix, leafy green, or salad mix components from its operations in Mexico,"" the FDA website says. The company says it will not sell these products again until it receives FDA approval. As of Monday, 539 people in 19 states have been sickened by cyclospora, a rare type of parasite that causes intestinal illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At least 32 people have been hospitalized. The salad mix from Taylor Farms was linked specifically to cyclospora cases from Iowa and Nebraska. The CDC is not yet sure that all of the states' cases are part of the same outbreak. FDA investigators traced the outbreak to four ""illness clusters"" of restaurants, which FDA spokeswoman Theresa Eisenman later identified to CNN as Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations. The probe didn't find indications that any bags of salad mix with the rare type of parasite were sold at U.S. grocery stores. ""Nothing we have seen prior to this announcement gave us any reason to be concerned about the products we've received from this supplier,"" the restaurants' parent company, Darden, said in a statement. Darden also insisted ""it is completely safe to eat in our restaurants."" Taylor Farms has been cooperating with U.S. officials, the FDA said, adding that tests will be conducted at the company's processing facility in Mexico ""to try to learn the probable cause of the outbreak and identify preventive controls."" The last inspection there, in 2011, turned up no notable problems, according to the federal agency. The company's CEO, Bruce Taylor, told CNN this month that its plant in Mexico produced and distributed about 48 million servings of salads to thousands of restaurants in the Midwest and Eastern United States in June. ""We have an extensive testing program in Mexico to test water sources and raw product for coliforms, E. coli, salmonella and listeria,"" Taylor said. ""All our tests have been negative, and we have no evidence of cyclospora in our product."" As of Wednesday, there had been 153 cases of cyclospora inspections reported in Iowa, according to that state's public health department. There have been 86 reported cases in Nebraska. Texas currently has the most reported cases with 215, according to the CDC. Authorities have not singled out a common source for the Lone Star State's outbreak, which is largely centered in and around Dallas and Fort Worth. Despite the lack of a connection, a Dallas woman sued Darden on Friday -- soon after the FDA implicated the restaurant company -- ""for all general, special, incidental and consequential damages"" tied to her July 1 visit to an Olive Garden in Addison, Texas. Suzanne Matteis contends in her lawsuit that four days after eating spaghetti with meat sauce and a salad from Olive Garden, she suffered severe intestinal issues. She says a clinic near her home took a stool sample and diagnosed her with a cyclospora infection. Matteis says she's still not feeling completely recovered. ""I think I'm getting better, but I still don't have a lot of energy. I'm pooped. I'm worn out,"" she told CNN. While he wasn't aware of the lawsuit until CNN alerted him, Darden spokesman Mike Bernstein said his group's restaurants in Texas have a different supplier than its restaurants in Iowa and Nebraska. Iowa health authorities said last week that the prepackaged salad mix of iceberg and romaine lettuce, carrots and red cabbage was no longer in the state's supply chain. ""Bagged salads and all other vegetables are safe to eat,"" the state's health department said. People get the disease by eating food or drinking water that's been contaminated with feces from the parasite. The ailment -- which strikes in places where cyclospora is common such as tropical or subtropical regions but occasionally in the United States as well -- causes symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss and nausea that can last anywhere from a few days to more than a month. CNN's Jacque Wilson, Val Willingham, Greg Botelho, Amanda Watts and Caleb Hellerman contributed to this report.","NEW: Taylor Farms has voluntarily stopped shipping lettuce from Mexico, FDA says .

"(CNN) -- As Secretary of State John Kerry pursues new peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, he and President Obama will need broad-based support in efforts for peace, which will come only through bridging the gulf between those who identify primarily with Israelis and those who identify primarily with Palestinians. As a rabbi and the director of a Jewish human rights organization, I have seen how that gulf inhibits all of us in our ability to support the peace process. A few cases in point: A pro-Palestinian activist was struggling to understand why the Jewish community reacts so strongly against calls to boycott and divest from Israel. After all, she told me, boycotts are an accepted nonviolent tactic for achieving a political goal. Didn't I know about the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa? Or the fight for the rights of migrant grape workers in California? What about the Montgomery bus boycott? But the word ""boycott"" carries terrible associations for Jews. I explained to her that it is linked in our minds to the boycotts of Jewish businesses in Nazi Germany, which presaged the deportations and murders. Then there's the history of blood libel, the false accusations of Jewish violence against Christians that often prompted boycotts and worse. The very word boycott triggers this communal post-traumatic stress, regardless of the intentions of those advocating for such tactics. Not long after, the director of a national Jewish organization complained to me that protests against the occupation, including calls for boycotts and divestment, seek to smear Israel's image and de-legitimize the country's right to exist. Although I don't support boycotts of Israel, I challenged him to consider that the worst damage to Israel's image and credibility might come from the occupation itself. The failure of the two sides to communicate has implications far beyond whether pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian advocates can get along. Within the United States, we have seen a breakdown in relationships between Jewish communities and other minority communities who have long been natural allies for an open, diverse and equitable America. The inability to break out of one-sided rhetoric also limits both sides' willingness to accept the painful concessions that will be necessary for peace. Those who sympathize primarily with the Palestinians must recognize that the trauma of the Holocaust and of thousands of years of anti-Semitism remains an open wound for the Jewish community. We will never ""get over it."" Acknowledging this trauma does not mean that criticism of Israeli policy is off limits. Instead, those protesting the occupation need to clamp down on any rhetoric that crosses the line into anti-Semitic stereotyping, that denies Jewish history and identity, or that dismisses the suffering and human rights of Israelis. There can be no space within the anti-occupation movement for negative portrayals of Jews, calls to wipe out Israel, or diatribes against ""Zionists,"" a word that most Jews understand as a barely veiled reference to all of us. When Hamas militants shoot rockets at towns and villages in Israel, the Jewish community needs to hear condemnation from those who most often ally themselves with Palestinians. Those who sympathize primarily with Israel must similarly reject dehumanizing rhetoric about Palestinians or Muslims. It is vital to acknowledge the day-to-day suffering of Palestinians, who contend with the theft of private land, long and demeaning checkpoint lines, and violence from settlers and soldiers. Responding with disbelief to painful narratives, or countering with stories of Israel's scientific and medical achievements, paints the Jewish community as tone deaf to the suffering of others. When the Israeli government issues building permits for a new settlement, demolishes a Palestinian home, or levies only minor penalties on Jews who attack Palestinians and their property, mainstream Jewish leaders need to condemn these actions as unjust and destructive of the possibility for peace. Those on both sides who are unwilling to change their rhetoric should come clean about whether they are actually committed to peace. Those who tolerate language that demonizes Jews or who justify violence against Israeli civilians must ask themselves whether they are actually most interested in achieving a better future for Palestinians, or whether they are indulging in dangerous anti-Semitism. Those who dismiss Palestinian suffering or who rationalize violence against Palestinian civilians must ask themselves whether they are serious about a two-state solution, or whether they are simply looking for excuses to sustain the occupation indefinitely. Each side also needs to look forward instead of back. Jews must acknowledge that this moment is neither the Germany of the 1930s nor the Israel of the second intifada. The very prominence of boycotts, protests and appeals to the United Nations -- whether we approve of these tactics or not -- reflects a decision by the Palestinian majority to pursue nonviolent efforts to achieve a state. Those who take up the Palestinian cause must acknowledge that the state of Israel and its more than 6 million Jewish citizens are here to stay. Both sides need to stop arguing about whose fault it is that previous negotiations have failed. It's easier to attack and defend than to seek to understand the other side's legitimate needs and emotions. But there's no easy way around it. Creating a just and peaceful future for Israelis and Palestinians requires doing it the hard way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of .","Israeli-Palestinian peace talks need support that comes from understanding of both sides .

"(CNN) -- They're tall, they're historic and they're one of the most significant collections of freestanding treasures of ancient China. No, they're not the Terracotta Warriors of Xi'an. They're the ""diaolou"" of Kaiping, more than 1,800 centuries-old watchtowers that dot the rice fields around the city of Kaiping in the Guangdong Province. Despite the city's gorgeous landscape and a UNESCO World Heritage Site listing, Kaiping sees relatively few visitors each year -- for China, anyway. Last year's record 600,000 visitors was disappointing for local officials, who lament that Kaiping is more deserving of visitors than more well known cities in China, which can hit that number in a week. China's official desire to raise Kaiping's profile is understandable -- the city offers a rare and tranquil travel experience that doubles as a history lesson on unique Chinese architecture. Fusion architecture . The multistory watchtowers were built in the beginning of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as a defensive response to incessant bandit raids. Heavy flooding in the area also played into the need for towers and three types of diaolou emerged over the centuries; defensive, residential and communal. ""Most diaolou were designed with reinforced structures, thick walls and small windows,"" explains Liwen Huang, marketing manager for the Tourism Administration of Kaiping Travel Resource Development Center. At the beginning of the 20th century, Kaiping became a major source of overseas emigres. Many Kaiping natives eventually returned to the homes with newly acquired wealth, and built diaolou with Western touches incorporated into the architecture. Residential diaolou became a way for owners' to display their wealth via flamboyant designs. Along with the ancient diaolou's historic significance, the unique fusion of Chinese and Western architecture was a major factor in UNESCO's 2007 decision to confer World Heritage Site designation upon the structures. China's ancient donut-like homes: Where to see the tulou . Baroque, Roman and Gothic influences are clearly visible in many of the watchtowers. ""Chinese who went overseas brought these exotic elements back home, as they found Western architecture splendid while they were abroad,"" says Huang. In some cases, local builders worked from images on postcards that were sent from abroad, creating unique designs. Li Garden . The best example of a luxurious diaolou can be found at Li Garden, in the Beiyi Xiang district. Built in 1936 by wealthy Chinese emigrant businessman Weili Xie (he had four wives and more than 20 children), the 11,000-square-meter complex is composed of one diaolou, six villas, two gardens, waterways and bridges. The luxurious interior was built with materials imported from overseas. Quanzhou: China's forgotten historic port . The complex was equipped with then-modern Western elements, such as flushing toilets, sinks, marble tile and fireplaces -- this at a time when most Chinese were living in tiny cottages with outdoor toilets. The garden has 20-meter steel pillars, a huge golden pavilion shaped like a birdcage and a green pond for turtles. Each window was built with at least four panes of glass to protect against firearms. What to eat while in town . Sweets are a specialty of Kaiping street stalls. Grass jelly: Made of mesona chinensis, a Chinese herb, grass jelly is one of Kaiping's most popular summer snacks. The jelly tastes best when served with shaved ice, syrup, honey or condensed milk. The sweetness balances the mild bitterness of the herb. Tofu pudding: A popular local dessert, tofu pudding has a delicate, creamy texture. Locals add a little sugar to make it more flavorful. Maltose sticks: A short wooden stick is used to stir, then mount melted maltose -- turning it into a delicious golden, sticky snack. How to get there . Fly to Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, take a taxi to Tianhe Coach Terminal Station, which should cost about RMB120 ($20); buses depart from Tianhe Coach Terminal Station to Kaiping from 7:30 a.m. to 7:15 p.m.; tickets cost RMB38 ($6).","The watchtowers in Kaiping, China, were originally built for defense against bandit raids .

"(CNN) -- The Mississippi River rolls muddy and wide beneath a gray, spitting sky. The St. Louis Arch, symbol of the once unimaginable promise of the nation's westward expansion, looms above the barges pushing past and the summer traffic below. Across the water, at 35 years old, Lolanda Ohene is staring at the skyline and wondering what has happened to her future. ""I thought I'd be more successful right now,"" she says, ""have better health insurance, better (working) conditions, just better everything, because I'm in America."" She laughs softly. ""We're supposed to have better quality everything here, but we don't."" Ohene is a forklift operator at a warehouse and one of the countless working Americans struggling with the long, slow economic recovery, characterized by the latest jobs report, which once again shows unemployment above 7%. The rate has not dipped below that number since November 2008, two months before Barack Obama became president. His defenders point out that the nose dive in jobs began under President Bush; his detractors counter that Obama has not exactly proven a wizard at reversing the trend. Forget the politics: The bottom line is that sustained unemployment of more than 7% is wreaking havoc in ways that many economists fear are being overlooked as the nation grows numb to the dreadful monthly numbers. ""It's a total employers' market,"" says John Schmitt, a senior economist at the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research. He argues that the first and foremost effect is an erosion of the bargaining positions for workers everywhere. ""If you are looking for a job, you take whatever is offered. If you have a job, you don't complain. If wages are going to be frozen, if benefits are going to be cut, you suck it up. There's not much you can do."" Other profound changes emerging from the 7% landscape: The Labor Department reports four times as many workers are now being offered temporary or part-time positions than full-time jobs; reports have abounded for many months about how even the full-time positions now don't pay as well as those lost in the Great Recession. Certainly, President Obama is sensitive to all that. He has been barnstorming the country in recent weeks leading sing-along choruses of ""The Let's Save the Middle Class Rag,"" the song that got him re-elected. But aside from the politics, there are practical reasons he, his Democrats, and Republicans, too, need to see the 7% floor broken, and soon. As Schmitt puts it, ""Seven out of a hundred workers that would like to have a job don't have one. That's an enormous amount of lost resources in the economy. That means people aren't producing goods and services, aren't consuming goods and services. ..."" And they aren't paying taxes. At least not at the rate that governments require to keep up with benefits for a population trying to claw out of an economic hole. That's why, back in St. Louis, Mayor Francis Slay gets agitated over people growing accustomed to such a high unemployment rate. ""For people to accept that as the norm would be very, very dangerous,"" he tells me as we sit in the office of St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley, who chimes in. ""I think it is not the American way of life. We can do better than that. We've got to continue to invest in our infrastructure. You've got to have amenities."" And both men know, you can't do any of that with a crippling unemployment rate hanging around year after year. Missouri, by the way, has a current unemployment rate just under 7%, but across the river in Illinois, it's over 9%. To be sure, some progress is being made. Look at the charts from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and you'll see creeping improvements in the jobs numbers over the past few years. But the National Conference of State Legislatures in its spring report said while most states are no longer teetering on the edge of economic calamity, there is still ""a dose of uncertainty, as states continue to plod their way through an extended economic recovery."" What everyone wants, of course, is ""full employment."" That's a term economists don't like much because while it describes a simple idea (everyone who wants a job has one), the details are squishy. For starters, ""full employment"" does not and will never mean 0% unemployment. People are always changing jobs, looking for new positions, or taking breaks, so some percentage of the population is expected to be out of work at any given time. Furthermore, some economists -- not many, but some -- believe that whenever an unemployment rate stabilizes for a period of years at any number, like say 7% or above, that is by definition ""full employment"" because the economy is essentially ""full"" of workers or it would hire more. William Dickens, however, is not one of them. ""I have a lot of problems with that."" Dickens is a distinguished professor of economics at Northeastern University in Boston, who has written and researched extensively into the causes and effects of unemployment. ""Before the recession, (full employment) was typically estimated to be in the range of 4 to 6%. Since the recession, there are indications that number may have gone up. My own estimates suggest it is somewhere between 5 and perhaps a little bit over 6% now, although nowhere near 7 or 7Â½%."" The ways in which those numbers can change are complicated. Imagine a chalkboard filled with elaborate, baffling equations and you'll get the gist even if you don't get the picture. But it all comes down to the idea that 7% is not even close to ""full employment"" in the eyes of most economists, and some parts of the population are disastrously far from even that mark. Last year, for example, African-American males faced an unemployment rate of 15%. And here is the thing: Young workers -- all those bright-eyed, optimistic kids with their iPhones -- who are being pounded by the employment situation now, will likely never recover from the beating. Read that again: They will never recover. ""There is evidence that entering a troubled labor market has a permanent scarring effect,"" Dickens says. ""Somebody who enters a labor market during a downturn, they're going to see lower wages throughout their career."" All that is the damning legacy of that stubborn 7%-plus that keeps coming out each month. Blame whomever you wish politically, but even if the number has started looking benign after all these months, there is no denying the economic tidal wave rumbling beneath it. Even now, it is washing around Lolanda Ohene, as she stands on the riverbank while her friend Vernon Glenn roams up. He is 27, works in a factory and has a strategy for economic survival: ""Just got to try to keep your head up high and save all you can, if you can."" She smiles and turns back to the river. Until that number changes, it is as good a plan as any.","The U.S. unemployment rate has stalled at more than 7% .

"(CNN) -- Is the music festival as scene of warm beer, ear-drum-shattering amplification and mud-splattered mayhem under threat? With Britain's Eton-educated Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, spotted at Cornbury -- aka Poshstock -- this year, Glastonbury tickets costing upward of $300 and yurts and hempseed smoothies present at even the most ordinary events, all the evidence is there. At these popular upscale music and culture fests in Britain (the country seems to specialize in them) and Europe, guests are as well-bred as the organic cows minced up for the burgers, the music avoids topics of social revolution and the booze may be bubbly, but it also tends to be French. Cornbury Music Festival, Oxfordshire, UK . ""A homespun melting pot where music-lovers share pies and a glass of champagne with superstars, toffs, rockers, crooners [and] Morris dancers."" That's how Cornbury describes itself. Known as ""poshstock,"" especially since British Prime Minister David Cameron was spotted there this year (albeit apparently hiding behind a pair of fake Ray-Ban sunglasses), the festival places great emphasis on comfort. With accommodation options including yurts (yes, the surprise accommodation hit of the decade has even made it to this bastion of the British establishment) and fully furnished cabins, you feel as if you're checking into a charming little boutique hotel here, rather than attending a three-day open-air music festival. Yoga workshops are available, should you suffer any back strain catching a glimpse of acts including Van Morrison and The Proclaimers. The VIP tent has plush sofas and a hair salon if you get too out of sorts. Cornbury Music Festival; every July; day tickets from £15 ($23); +44 (0)844 581 0777 . Festival No 6, Portmeirion, Wales . ""Your weekend will be spent in the most stylish ... setting imaginable,"" declares Festival No 6 -- without modesty, true, but also without too much exaggeration. Held in the achingly (literally, to some) quaint Welsh village of Portmeirion, a purpose-built resort modeled on an Italian village, venues include a ballroom and a ""piazza."" Accommodation ranges from Portmeirion Castle (now, a castle really isn't Glastonbury 1978) to, inevitably, ""luxury yurts."" Among performance highlights at this year's ""intimate, bespoke banquet of music, arts and culture,"" to quote the giddy festival organizers again, are the Brythoniaid Male Voice Choir, travel writer Jan Morris and harpist Georgia Ruth. Festival No 6; every September (13-15 in 2013); tickets from £170 ($265) Aphrodite Festival, Paphos, Cyprus . Held in the grounds of the city's medieval castle, Aphrodite is a global highlight on the opera lover's calendar. Singers might hit the high notes but you shouldn't get carried away by all the extravagant emotion depicted in the opera performances -- the prevailing mood here is genteel, just in the way it isn't at, say, the Bloodstock Open Air heavy metal festival in Derbyshire, UK. Highlight of this year's Aphrodite lineup is the Donizetti opera L'Elisir D'Amore, performed by the Opera Future Verona. Pafos Aphrodite Festival; every September (6-8 in 2013); tickets from €25 ($33) Galtres Festival, North Yorkshire, UK . ""We British love our stately homes,"" says the 45-year-old director of this Yorkshire event, James Houston. ""Give us a fine tune, a glass of something nice to drink and a posh house, and we're the happiest folk in the world."" Thus is the posh-festival ethos perfectly articulated. Apart from the venue, Duncombe Park stately home, the culinary approach here is about as starkly different from the lukewarm beer and equally lukewarm food of what some would regard as a properly grimy festival. Everything is resolutely local, seasonal, ""artisan"" and Fairtrade, from the tea and cakes from the Deliciousness Tea Shop, to the Full of Beans coffee and the really rather annoyingly titled Boogie Breakfasts. Galtres Festival; every August (23-25 in 2013); tickets from £20 ($31) Øya Festival, Oslo, Norway . The Festival Outlook website calls Øya ""boutique,"" which sounds about right. You won't find soggy burgers, or even organic ones. All forest herbs and fungi, Scandinavian grub is front of the queue for discerning foodies at the moment, and Øya shows it off with pretentious elan. Head chef at Oslo's Michelin-starred Maaemo restaurant, Esben Holmboe Bang is one of the culinary crew keeping hungry -- but picky -- festival-goers happy. The festival venue is a historic Oslo park containing the ruins of a medieval church. True, there's a camping ground -- but it has a pool and Wi-Fi. With a nod to pre-organic-certified festivals of old, this year's lineup included graying rockers Blur and Kraftwerk. Øya Festival; every August; day tickets from 725 kroner ($130) Tomorrow Land, Boom, Belgium . Held in the aptly named Belgian town of Boom, Tomorrow Land is a three-day dance festival with a difference. No doubt other substances will be consumed to augment the electronic beats, but the food is hugely different from the greasy takeaways that so often accompany a clubbing night out. The pop-up onsite restaurant Maison Bru serves food by the eponymous Michelin-starred Belgian chef Wout Bru; there's a festival bakery; and gluten-free food can be ordered in advance for those sensitive types. Tomorrow Land; every July; tickets from €82 ($110) Henley Festival, Henley, UK . ""Black ties. Sharp suits. Designer dresses. Generous servings of decadence, garnished with sophistication."" Thus the Henley Festival sets the scene for festival-goers ""in the know."" Or, to put it another way, well off festival-goers. This posh Oxfordshire bash completes the Henley Royal Regatta every year, a rowing race whose entrants and spectators share a good concentration of blue blood. You can spear moules frites and other French delicacies prepared by celebrated father and son chefs Albert and Michel Roux while listening to Madness and the Beach Boys, among other acts. Henley Festival; every July; tickets from £52 ($80) Verbier Festival, Verbier, Switzerland . All pretty evening gowns and penguin suits, this elite classical music event takes place every summer in a little Alpine town in that home of all things pricey, Switzerland. Big ticket performers have included Julian Lloyd Webber, Bryn Terfel and the young Russian classical star Evgeny Kissin. Tapas on slate platters are among the superior servings at two pop-up restaurants. Interval chat could cover limited-edition time pieces and travel -- to other tax havens around the world, that is. You won't find many camping enthusiasts here -- where would one hang one's designer gown? -- but there are plenty of upscale chalets to rent in the village and around. Verbier Festival; from July to August each year; tickets from 50 francs ($55) Port Eliot Festival, Cornwall, UK . The word ""twee"" inevitably suggests itself when describing this festival of music and the arts set in and around yet another stately home. A sample of the non-headbanging performances on show include the poet Luke Wright, gentle satirist of yummy mummies and inbred aristocratic politicians, and a capella versions of pop songs from the 50 Degrees Choir. Exhibits, when you tire of all that noise, have included a collection of dolls owned by various legendary fashion designers. Metallica, watch out!

"(CNN) -- By all accounts, it was a storybook wedding. Eighty of the bride and groom's closest friends and family watched as the beaming couple exchanged rings under a bridge on New York City's shoreline in Astoria Park. Except these weren't your run-of-the-mill fairytale nuptials. In Joanna Scutts' storybook, the bride dazzled her husband-to-be in a gold-sequined, boatneck sheath on their wedding day. ""I knew I didn't want a white dress, as it was really important to me to feel like myself at the wedding -- and I never wear white,"" she said. ""I'm a pale-skinned redhead, and any shade of white makes me look dead."" Scutts is one of many brides choosing to walk down the aisle in a nontraditional colorful dress. In this week's People Magazine, Jessica Biel reveals the custom pink Giambattista Valli Haute Couture gown that she wore when she tied the knot with Justin Timberlake in southern Italy on October 19. Biel certainly isn't the first celebrity to color outside the bridal lines: Reese Witherspoon graced the cover of People Magazine in April 2011 wearing a blush Monique Lhuillier gown for her second marriage; Sarah Jessica Parker famously wore black on her wedding day with Matthew Broderick; and Sofia Coppola married Thomas Mars in August 2011 in a violet Azzedine AlaÃ¯a dress. ""Brides today want their wedding to be a reflection of their personality -- they're no longer embracing tradition for tradition's sake,"" said Nicole Sewall, the managing director of BHLDN, Anthropologie's bridal and special occasion brand. ""We've seen a lot of brides throw the wedding rules, as we know them, out."" Sewall says BHLDN brides have embraced color in a less dramatic sense; vintage crÃ¨me, nude tones and very pale pink are all popular choices. This matrimonial trend is old hat on the runway. In recent years, Christian Dior, Vera Wang and Chanel have showed bridal gowns in various shades of red, while Elie Saab has played with pewter and metallic hues. When Rani Totman launched her bridal line, St. Pucchi, in 1985, her entire collection of 16 dresses was in color. ""Many cultures believe that the color white indicates purity or virginity and so some women feel that they are required to wear white rather than the colored gowns they would love to wear,"" said Totman. ""My brides, who have repeatedly opted for color, are ones that do not let this general belief affect their decision."" Totman said her color palette was influenced by her upbringing in Thailand, where many of the brides she knew wore colorful wedding attire. In many non-Western cultures, including Southeast Asia and India, weddings are often opulent affairs draped with multicolored fabrics. Just as many women emulated Princess Diana's and, now, Kate Middleton's gowns, another royal set the Western precedent for the ""white wedding"" in 1840. According to Dalhousie University, the modern bride can attribute the 170-plus-year-trend to Queen Victoria, who married Prince Albert in a white gown at The Chapel Royal in St. James' Palace. Since then, the Victorian era wedding gown has come to represent Christianity and female sexual purity. Scutts says her wedding planning, as well as her dress, was definitely rooted in both her and her husband's ""feminist resistance to much of wedding tradition."" The ceremony did not have a religious element. According to a recent Pew survey, 13 million Americans identify as either agnostic or atheist; while one in five Americans is religiously unaffiliated. Shannon Flynn, a 34-year-old freelance writer from Clifton Park, New York, also opted for a nontraditional, nonreligious wedding. Though, unlike Scutts, she did entertain the notion of the traditional white dress. ""Stepping into a layered gown with corsets and organza and lord knows what else, man, it made this jeans and T-shirt gal almost roll up into the fetal position and start sucking my thumb,"" said Flynn, describing the one -- and only -- trip to a traditional bridal salon with her parents. Flynn ultimately decided on a vibrant red cocktail dress with matching high heels. ""Putting on a show that didn't reflect our beliefs or interests seemed silly,"" said Flynn. ""I grew up Catholic and the 'white dress' symbolizes something I'm not. I guess, even though I am now nonreligious, it would have felt a bit like a lie."" Despite shying away from the traditional pomp and ""till death do us part"" circumstance, Scutts and Flynn had one tradition they both supported on their wedding day: It's the bride's time to shine. ""The only rule as far as guest dress code: Don't wear red!"" said Flynn. ""I tried on a heap of dresses in all kinds of colors, wanting something that still stood out and said 'bride' -- or at least, 'dressiest person there,'"" said Scutts.

"New York (CNN) -- New York City restaurant owners were back to business as usual on Tuesday, selling pitchers of soda and other super-sized drinks that would have been banned without a judge's 11th-hour intervention. A citywide ban on the sale of sugary drinks in containers holding more than 16 ounces was set to go into effect Tuesday before state Supreme Court Justice Milton Tingling blocked the city's restrictions on Monday, calling them ""arbitrary and capricious."" ""It's no harm, no foul for us,"" said Josh Lebowitz, owner of Brother Jimmy's BBQ in Manhattan. ""We'll go back to our old way of doing business."" In preparation for the expected ban on large sugary drinks at restaurants, fast-food eateries, movie theaters and stadiums in New York City, Lebowitz purchased 1,000 16-ounce cups to replace the 24-ounce ones used to serve soda at his five restaurants. But after Monday's ruling, Lebowitz says those 16-ounce cups will remain in their boxes. ""We'll hold onto them for the time being,"" he said. ""We're not going to use them."" Tingling's ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed by a group of business associations -- including the National Association of Theatre Owners of New York State and the American Beverage Association, which hailed the decision as a ""sigh of relief to New Yorkers and thousands of small businesses in New York City."" The city wasted no time in appealing Tingling's decision. How New Yorkers feel about big soda ban . ""We are moving forward immediately with our appeal,"" said Michael Cardozo, the city's corporation counsel. ""We believe the judge was wrong in rejecting this important public health initiative. We also feel he took an unduly narrow view of the Board of Health's powers."" Mayor Michael Bloomberg touted the sugary drink ban as a step toward eradicating New York City's ""obesity epidemic."" ""We are confident that we will win [the appeal],"" Bloomberg said at a press conference at Lucky's Cafe in Midtown Manhattan, where owner Laki Anagnostopoulos has decided to comply with the city's sugary drink restrictions despite the court's decision. ""It's not about money at the end of the day, it's about making a change,"" said Anagnostopoulos' son, Greg, adding that the restaurant has eliminated 24-ounce to-go cups and 20-ounce bottles of soda from its menu. Other businesses were not as ready to comply with the restrictions in the wake of the court ruling. ""We have maintained our position from the beginning that any regulations to eliminate New Yorkers' rights to purchase beverages in sizes of their choice is not in the public's interest,"" Dunkin' Donuts said in a statement. ""With the ban now declared invalid, customers in New York City will find all their favorite beverages in the sizes they want available at Dunkin' Donuts."" Iman Kimel, owner of Frames Bowling Lounge in Manhattan, had a so-called ""plan B"" for when he was no longer able to offer patrons pitchers of soda -- sell pitchers of juice instead. The high-end bowling alley's chef developed recipes for cranberry-apple and mint, carrot and citrus juices, among other blends. Ethicist: Health bans and 'sin taxes' can easily backfire . Until the law dictates otherwise, though, Frames will continue to offer pitchers of soda -- which come with a standard birthday party package. ""As long as we can sell soda in larger quantities, we will,"" said Frames marketing manager Frayda Resnick. Tingling wrote that his decision was based on the fact that the ban was ""laden with exceptions."" In addition, the law would have exempted a variety of retailers, including 7-Eleven, seller of the iconic ""Big Gulp"" drinks, because it is regulated by the state, not the city. ""The effect would be a person is unable to buy a drink larger than 16 ounces at one establishment but may be able to buy it at another establishment that may be located right next door,"" Tingling wrote. Bloomberg said that the city's legislation was aimed only at the businesses that the city has the right to regulate. ""We just think the judge was totally wrong,"" Bloomberg said, adding that the city can only enact legislation ""where we have the right to do it."" CNN's Mary Snow and Melanie Hicken contributed to this report.","NYC businesses continue to sell large sodas .
