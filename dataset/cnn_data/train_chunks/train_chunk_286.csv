"(CNN) -- Zac Efron is ready to talk. The 26-year-old actor best known for ""High School Musical"" went to rehab in 2013 but was elusive about what he sought treatment for. Now, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Efron is coming clean about his battle with alcohol and drug use. ""It's a never-ending struggle,"" the actor said of his issues with addiction. ""I was drinking a lot, way too much."" There were drugs as well, he added. The problem erupted for Efron as he tried to work his way from being the teen star of ""High School Musical"" and ""Hairspray"" to more adult roles with movies such as ""The Lucky One"" and ""The Paperboy."" ""I had done films back-to-back-to-back. I was burnt out,"" he said. ""There was something lacking, some sort of hole that I couldn't really fill up. I was just so deep into my work, it was really the only thing I had."" That period of his life left him feeling isolated, he said, but in hindsight he can see how it helped him grow. ""I mean, you're in your 20s, single, going through life in Hollywood, you know?"" he told The Hollywood Reporter. ""Everything is thrown at you. I wouldn't take anything back; I needed to learn everything I did."" Part of that learning experience has been aided by therapy, and joining Alcoholics Anonymous. ""I just started going, and I think it's changed my life,"" Efron said. ""I'm much more comfortable in my own skin. Things are so much easier now."" This year, Efron is hoping that a buttoned-up lifestyle -- complete with daily workouts and a 9 p.m. bedtime, or so he says -- paired with his newfound wisdom will help him steer his career in the direction he wants it to go. Earlier this year he starred in and produced the comedy ""That Awkward Moment,"" and on May 9 his comedy with Seth Rogen, ""Neighbors,"" will arrive in theaters. ""It's impossible to lead an honest and fulfilling life as a man and not make mistakes and 'fess up to them when you need to,"" Efron said. ""I'm a human being, and I've made a lot of mistakes. I've learned from each one.""","Zac Efron admits to struggle with alcohol and drugs .

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- Paul the Octopus, who correctly predicted the outcome of games during this year's World Cup soccer tournament, has died. The eight-tentacled cephalopod oracle died of natural causes, the aquarium where he lived said Tuesday. He was 2 and a half. ""We are consoled by the knowledge that he enjoyed a good life here ..."" said Stefan Porwoll, manager of the Oberhausen Sea Life Center in western Germany. ""We had all naturally grown fond of him and he will be sorely missed."" Paul enthralled millions of people around the world by correctly predicting the outcome of several World Cup matches this year. The life and times of Paul the Octopus in images . His caretakers set him up to make predictions for a particular match by draping boxes in his tank with the national flags of teams that were set to play each other. The boxes contained octopus food. The caretakers divined Paul's pick by watching to see which box he opened first. ""Paul amazed the world by correctly predicting the winners of all Germany's World Cup clashes, and then of the final,"" Porwoll said in a statement. His prescience attracted a legion of news reporters and photographers. It also inspired a special clothing line and mobile phone applications, the center said. A documentary film on Paul is scheduled to debut soon. And donations made in Paul's name helped pay for a permanent sea turtle rescue center on the Greek island of Zakynthos. The sea center has Paul's body in cold storage as it finalizes funeral plans. ""We may decide to give Paul his own small burial plot within our grounds and erect a modest permanent shrine,"" Porwoll said.

"(CNN) -- If you've ever traveled by air, you've probably gotten soaked on an airline ticket. But not like this. Qantas Airlines Flight 94 to Melbourne had to turn back to Los Angeles about an hour into its trip Wednesday morning when a water pipe started leaking on the upper deck of the plane, according to Australia's Channel Seven Network. The jet is an Airbus A380, the world's only complete double-decker airplane. Video from the network showed water running down the aisle of the plane. The water made its way through the floor and showered economy-class passengers below, the network reported. Crew members moved passengers and gave them blankets to stay dry, the airline said in a statement. Qantas said the passengers were never in any danger, and they're being put up in hotels while the airline talks to the plane's manufacturer, Airbus, about what might have caused the situation.

"(CNN) -- This year marks the 20th anniversary of the opening of the Channel Tunnel linking France with the United Kingdom, and the 50th anniversary of the deal which led to its creation. To mark the occasion, we're taking a look at some of the world's greatest tunnels. Channel Tunnel (UK and France) Connecting the United Kingdom with continental Europe (it has entrances/exits in Folkestone, Kent, and Pas-de-Calais in northern France), the tunnel has the world's longest undersea section -- 37.9 kilometers (23.5 miles). Though a marvel of the modern age, it wasn't a new idea when it was built. French engineer Albert Mathieu proposed a tunnel under the English Channel in 1802, although his plans included an artificial island mid-channel where horse-drawn carriages could make maintenance stops. ""This tunnel defined the term 'mega project,'"" says Matt Sykes, tunnel expert and director at engineering company Arup. ""It fundamentally changed the geography of Europe and helped to reinforce high speed rail as a viable alternative to short-haul flights."" Length: 50 kilometers (31 miles) Fast fact: Though both the English and French put in work to build the Channel Tunnel, the English side tunneled a greater distance. More info: Euro Tunnel . Laerdal Tunnel (Aurland, Norway) The Laerdal Tunnel in West Norway is the world's longest road tunnel and cost $153 million to build, which works out at $6,250 per meter. The length of the tunnel prompted engineers to include various features designed to alleviate claustrophobia and tiredness. ""The sheer length of tunnel -- which takes 20 minutes to drive through -- led to innovation in the use of behavioral science and driver psychology in the design to reduce driver fatigue and improve safety,"" says Sykes. ""This resulted in large, colorfully lit caverns every six kilometers, providing points of interest and a unique driver experience."" Length: 24.5 kilometers (15.2 miles) Fast fact: Engineers separated the tunnel into different sections to give the illusion that drivers are traveling through a number of smaller tunnels. In these smaller sections drivers can take breaks, or even have a wedding ceremony, as one adventurous couple has previously done. More info: The Fjords . Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line (Tokyo) It's easy to mistake this tunnel for a bridge because part of the structure comprises a 4.4-kilometer span as well as a 9.6-kilometer subsea conduit. The Aqua Line crosses Tokyo Bay and connects the cities of Kawasaki and Kisarazu. It reduced the journey time between the two from 90 to 15 minutes. ""This project required the world's largest undersea tunnel boring machines and set the precedent for constructing two-lane road tunnels,"" points out Matt Sykes at Arup. ""The resilience of the construction was demonstrated during the 2011 Tohoku-Pacific Ocean earthquake, which caused severe damage to Tokyo Bay."" Length: 14 kilometers total (8.7 miles) Fast fact: Constructed atop the Tokyo Bay Aqua Line is an island that functions as a rest area and mall. The man-made island, called Umi-Hotaru, is a popular scenic point with an observation deck that gives a great view of Tokyo Bay. More info: Nippon Civil Consulting Engineers . Eisenhower Tunnel (Colorado) Colorado's Eisenhower road tunnel is one of the world's highest, located 3,401 meters (11,158 feet) above sea level, at the highest point on the U.S. interstate highway system. It played a significant role in the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema was hired as a construction worker in 1972. Her supervisor misread her name as James, but realized his mistake and reassigned her to administrative duties after workers -- many of whom were former miners -- cited the common superstition that a woman's presence can bring bad luck to a mine. Bonnema sued and was allowed to return to the tunnel. A new equal rights law was subsequently passed. Length: 2.72 kilometers (1.7 miles) Fast fact: Prior to the tunnel's official opening in 1972, a drunk driver believed he should be the first person to take a vehicle through and was arrested for trespassing. Charges were subsequently dropped because the signs prohibiting traffic were considered inadequate. More info: Colorado Department of Transportation . Spiralen Tunnel (Drammen, Norway) The dramatic Spiralen road tunnel, built in 1961 and comprising six spirals covering 1,649 meters (5,413 feet), leads to one of the most spectacular viewpoints in the industrial town of Drammen. ""Despite being an expensive country, Norway builds some of the cheapest tunnels,"" says Alun Thomas, head of tunnels at engineering consultancy Ramboll. ""This is because the engineers strip the design down to the bare essentials required for the flow of traffic in the tunnels. Maximum benefit for minimum effort -- that's good engineering."" Length: 1.65 kilometers (1.02 miles) Fast fact: The tunnel opens out to a dramatic view of Drammen Valley and has a beer garden, restaurants and open-air museum. Guoliang Tunnel (Henan Province, China) Before the construction of this impressive tunnel, the only way to access the village of Guoliang was via a narrow path carved into the side of the Taihang Mountains. In 1972, a group of 13 villagers decided to construct a tunnel, which they dug by hand. Three died during the construction process but the tunnel transformed the village and became a tourist attraction in its own right. ""This tunnel is beautiful and a tribute the tenacity of the villagers who built it,"" says Thomas at Ramboll. ""For me it emphasizes how tunnel construction can enhance the environment as well as bringing huge benefits for society. At the same time, one should remember the cost and the fact that several villagers were killed during construction."" Length: 1.2 kilometers (0.74 miles) Fast fact: The tunnel was built jagged and steep due to the village's primitive tools, earning it the nickname: ""The road that does not tolerate any mistakes."" SMART (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) ""SMART is a combined road and flood relief tunnel,"" explains Thomas at Ramboll. ""It can be completely flooded to get rid of storm water and turned back into a road in a few hours."" The tunnel, the longest in Malaysia, was built to solve the problem of flash flooding in Kuala Lumpur. SMART can operate in three ways. When there's no flooding, it serves purely as a road tunnel. When there are floods, rainwater can be diverted into a lower channel, and the upper level will remain open to traffic. When exceptionally heavy floods occur, the tunnel closes to all traffic and watertight gates open to allow floodwater to flow through. Length: 9.7 kilometers (6.02 miles) Fast fact: The tunnel is expected to prevent billions of dollars of possible flood damage and costs from traffic congestion. Since it opened in 2007, flood-prone areas such as Masjid Jamek, Dataran Merdeka, Leboh Ampang and Jalan Melaka have been spared inundation. More info: SMART Motorway Tunnel . Bund Sightseeing Tunnel (Shanghai) This underwater Chinese tunnel is short and sweet, but spectacular and slightly strange. It spans the Huangpu River and connects Shanghai's Bund to Lujiazui, location of the Pearl TV tower. Passengers were originally going to be ferried from one side to the other on a moving walkway, but automated cars were installed instead. Length: 646.7 meters (2,122 feet) Fast fact: A company that had worked with Disney was originally supposed to help design the tunnel, but was deemed too expensive. Instead a Shanghai-based company created the tunnel's psychedelic lights and trippy audio-visual effects. The ride is apparently meant to represent a journey to the core of the earth, and the tunnel currently ranks as one of Shanghai's top five tourist attractions. Seikan Tunnel (Japan) The Seikan is a railway tunnel in Japan, but what makes it unique is the fact that a 23-kilometer (14.2 miles) stretch of the tunnel is 140 meters (460 feet) below sea level. It's the longest and deepest rail tunnel in the world, and spans the Tsugaru Strait, connecting Aomori Prefecture on the island of Honshu to the island of Hokkaido. Work on the tunnel started in 1964 and was completed in 1988. Length: 53 kilometers (32.9 miles) Fast fact: In 1976, construction workers hit a patch of soft rock and water gushed into the tunnel at a rate of 80 tons per minute. The leak took two months to fix.

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court offered dramatically different views on Tuesday over the constitutionality and scope of Virginia's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage. The Virginia petition and similar ones across the county confront a questioned unanswered by the U.S. Supreme Court: whether the Constitution guarantees equal protection for same-sex civil marriage. A ruling from the three-judge panel of 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals could perhaps come as early as next month. It would affect marriage laws in those states within the court's jurisdiction: Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Only Maryland has legalized same-sex marriage. A federal judge in February struck down Virginia's ban on constitutional grounds, the first time that had been done in a traditionally southern state. Ban formalized in 2006 . The prohibition has effectively been in place since Colonial days, but only incorporated into the state's constitution in 2006. That ruling continued a near-unbroken string of state and federal court victories nationwide in the past year, giving marriage-equality supporters unbridled encouragement that their ultimate goal will be achieved: striking all laws limiting the rights of homosexuals to wed. A state judge in Arkansas on Friday struck down a similar prohibition, and same-sex couples in Little Rock had lined up over the weekend to get marriage licenses. Gay and lesbian couples in Virginia cannot marry in the state until the current case is fully resolved. That may not happen until the Supreme Court decides whether to review the constitutional issues pending in several states, a process that may not begin at the earliest until later this year. Court asked to defer to voters . What the three judges in Richmond seemed to agree on Tuesday was that both sides of the issue were using the intermediate court as ""way-station up (Interstate) 95"" to the Supreme Court, where the social, political, and legal debate will ultimately and almost certainly be resolved. In the 70-minute argument, lawyers opposing same-sex marriage urged the judges to defer the issue to voters and ""the democratic process."" Austin Nimocks of the Alliance Defending Freedom said procreation and stable families were a key component of state laws supporting ""traditional"" marriage between one man and one woman. Judges weigh in . But Judge Roger Gregory repeatedly pressed counsel to explain why loving gay and lesbian couples should be treated differently, saying those arguments were ""disingenuous."" ""You can be in prison and still get married. Yet because of a person's sexual orientation, (gay couples) can't marry,"" said Gregory, who was appointed by George W. Bush. ""That sounds like a totalitarian system"" opponents of same-sex marriage were advocating. But Judge Paul Niemeyer suggested because the idea of same-sex marriage is a relatively recent issue in the courts and public consciousness, states could recognize gay and lesbian couples as ""Relationship B,"" different from the long-held concept of marriage between opposite sex couples. He questioned whether this ""brand new relationship"" is fundamental to constitutional protection, or something states should have the discretion to address as they see fit. The third member of the panel, Judge Henry Floyd, named to the court by President Barack Obama, asked few questions and his vote could swing the outcome. 'Second class relationship' Theodore Olson, among a group of lawyers representing the same-sex plaintiffs, told the court the state's law viewed his clients as being in a ""second class relationship."" Virginia's governor and attorney general, sworn into office in January, have reversed course from previous administrations and say they will not defend the current ban. ""I concluded that based on precedent marriage is a fundamental right protected by the U.S. Constitution,"" said Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring. Other states have also refused to defend current bans, including Kentucky, Nevada, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage within its borders: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Massachusetts on Saturday will mark the 10th anniversary becoming the first state to legally wed gay and lesbian couples. A separate federal appeals court last month heard challenges to same-sex marriage bans in Utah and Oklahoma. Appeals courts in coming weeks and months will hear similar lawsuits over current bans in Nevada, Texas, Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan. 'Equality for all Virginians' The challenge to Virginia's ban was brought by several plaintiffs, including Timothy Bostic and Tony London of Norfolk. ""The time has come for us and our state"" to recognize same-sex marriage, said Bostic after the court session. ""We truly want equality for all Virginians."" Also bringing suit are two Richmond-area women, whose marriage was formalized in California, but is not recognized in the commonwealth. ""I continue to be raised in a loving family,"" said Emily Schall Townley, the 16-year old daughter of Mary Townley and her partner Carol Schall, who have been together nearly three decades. ""These are my two moms and this is my family."" Supporters of traditional marriage between one-man and one-woman have criticized the rulings in Virginia and other states, for expanding the right to homosexuals. ""It appears that we have yet another example of an arrogant judge substituting her personal preferences for the judgment of the General Assembly and 57 percent of Virginia voters,"" said Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council. Supreme Court rulings . Last June, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume after it ruled private parties did not have ""standing"" to defend a voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. More importantly, the high court also rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in its 5-4 ""Windsor"" decision, citing equal protection guarantees to conclude same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits, such as tax breaks. Various individuals and gay rights groups have launched more than 70 pending marriage equality lawsuits in about 30 states. As far as the broader constitutional issues that have a chance of being heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in the next year or so, this week's Virginia case stands out -- if only because of history. It was an appeal of the so-called ""Loving"" case from Virginia in the late 1960's that led the justices to unanimously declare inter-racial marriage the law of the land.","Judges in Richmond express different views on hot-button issue .
The Virginia appeal is similar to others across the country .
They confront a question unanswered by the Supreme Court on equal protection .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Charles Grassley on Thursday asked Attorney General Eric Holder to provide a legal analysis that endorsed the swap of five Taliban figures held at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. It was the latest salvo in clashes between Congress and President Barack Obama over what to some lawmakers appears to be the President's tendency to act without consulting Capitol Hill. Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he was rebuffed earlier this year when he asked the Justice Department to release its legal analysis for when the President issues executive orders. But on Bergdahl, the lone remaining captive from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who was released over the weekend, he thinks the department needs to explain itself. A U.S. official told CNN the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel opinion on the Bergdahl matter was verbal and, as typically happens, likely will be issued in the form of a written opinion later. The department often refuses to release such opinions because they are considered protected under attorney-client privilege and the presidential executive privilege. Grassley, in his letter to Holder, nonetheless makes his case that while ""it is too late for Congress to express its concerns about these transfers in time to prevent them ... this measure of transparency will at least allow the American people to better understand the administration's purported basis for ignoring the legal requirement that Congress be notified in advance, and shed additional light on this controversial decision."" Grassley also said sharing the Justice Department's legal advice may also ensure the President abides by his oath"" to carry out the law. At issue is the administration's decision to ignore a restriction in the current defense policy law, signed by Obama last December, which requires 30-day notice to Congress before transferring terror detainees from Guantanamo Bay. Obama attached a statement when he signed the law that called the restrictions on transfers an illegal infringement on presidential executive powers and declared the right to ignore them when national security interests required it. Susan Rice said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that the Defense Department was given advice by the Justice Department before the swap. Hints of the legal advice provided to the Pentagon can be found in statements issued in recent days by the White House. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement that the administration's interpretation of the law determined that the 30-day notification requirement ""should be construed not to apply to this unique set of circumstances, in which the transfer would secure the release of a captive U.S. soldier, and the secretary of defense, acting on behalf of the President, has determined that providing notice as specified in the statute could endanger the soldier's life."" Hayden's statement said that because the 30-day notice would have required the Pentagon to delay the swap, the notification requirement would interfere with the President's constitutional power to protect Americans abroad and protecting U.S. soldiers. Hayden added: ""Because such interference would significantly alter the balance between Congress and the President, and could even raise constitutional concerns, we believe it is fair to conclude that Congress did not intend that the administration would be barred from taking the action it did in these circumstances.""

"(CNN) -- Rescuers have expanded the search for two tourists missing more than three days after the boat they were traveling on sank in Indonesia, as survivors recounted their ordeal at sea. The 23 other passengers and crew were rescued on Sunday, pulled from the water by local fishermen and search and rescue teams. The survivors spent more than 36 hours in the water. The two missing people are believed to be Spanish, other passengers on board said -- though officials at the Spanish foreign ministry could not confirm this. The tourists -- mostly from Europe -- were on what was supposed to be an exotic getaway: a cruise from west to east, departing from the island of Lombok -- which lies opposite Bali -- in the province of West Nusa Tenggara and ending in Labuan Bajo, in East Nusa Tenggara, with a number of stops along the way. Under normal conditions, the journey would take four nights to complete. Boat hits rocks . Everything appeared fine when the vessel, named Versace Amara, set sail last Thursday. Three days into the trip, the boat ran into trouble. Budiawan, head of the rescue mission, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, says it's believed the boat hit rocks off Sangeang, at about 1 a.m. local time on Saturday morning. Water began leaking into the vessel, forcing the passengers and crew to abandon ship. The vessel was carrying 20 tourists, three crew and two local guides. Budiawan said authorities were first notified of the incident on Sunday morning and immediately deployed rescuers to the site. The nearest town is Bima on the island of Sumbawa -- a two-hour boat ride away from where the boat sank. Recounting the disaster, one of the survivors said the group decided to split into two. ""There was a coastline visible, a deserted island about five kilometers (3.1 miles) through rough water,"" Tony Lawton from New Zealand told CNN affiliate the Seven Network. ""The 10 strongest swimmers decided to swim for the coast and they thought they'd probably survive it and luckily they did, but it was very close."" In the end, Lawton said the group got within half a kilometer of shore but were exhausted. They were able to wave at a group of fishermen on the beach, who went out to retrieve half of them on Sunday afternoon. Search officials say the other five were picked up by rescue crews. All from the first group were taken to hospital in Bima. Another 13 passengers and crew stayed in the water near the sunken boat, using lifebuoys and life vests to stay afloat. They were retrieved by local fishermen on Sunday evening, in the waters of Sape. They've since been treated in hospital, and eight are staying at a hotel in Bima, waiting for officials from their respective consulates to arrive to help them. Lack of equipment . Another survivor, Spanish national Rafael Martinez, criticized the lack of equipment on the boat. ""There was no security, no radio, no GPS, no navigation equipment. There were nothing,"" he told CNN affiliate Trans7 Indonesia. ""Only life jacket, but life jacket, it doesn't work. If you're in the middle of the ocean with a life jacket, what happens? Nothing."" ""This problem should have been solved very, very easy,"" another unidentified survivor told the Seven Network. ""We could have had a boat coming to rescue us in one hour, if they would have had any machine, radio, GPS or anything that all the boats will have. But without everything, maybe people are dead."" However, the tour operator rejected the survivors' claims. Tajudin Sam, owner of Eriksa Travel Agency, told CNN there was equipment on board to call for help. ""I admit no GPS, but the boat had two radio communications and was working well,"" he said. Tajudin said the boat was only three months' old and modeled on a traditional Phinisi sail boat -- but with a motor. He did admit he did not have a full list of the passengers' names and passport numbers. ""We normally do not make copies of the passports of the tourists for the cruise,"" he said. ""Passengers usually write down their own names and passport numbers on a list -- that's why in this case, some tourists wrote only their first names. I cannot read some of their handwriting clearly."" The two tourists still missing are believed to be male adults. Budiawan said it's believed the missing men, who were with the second group, became separated owing to strong currents. CNN's Chieu Luu contributed to this report.","Two missing, 23 other passengers and crew were rescued on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Scientists at the Large Hadron Collider managed to make two proton beams collide at high energy Tuesday, marking a ""new territory"" in physics, according to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The $10 billion research tool has been accelerating the beams since November in the LHC's 17-mile tunnel on the border of Switzerland and France. The beams have routinely been circulating at 3.5 TeV, or teraelectron volts, the highest energy achieved at the LHC so far, according to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Watch live Web cast from CERN . The first two attempts Tuesday failed, said Steve Myers, CERN's director for accelerators. He said the beams were lost before they reached their full energy. Experiments at the LHC may help answer fundamental questions such as why Albert Einstein's theory of relativity -- which describes the world on a large scale -- doesn't jibe with quantum mechanics, which deals with matter far too small to see. The collider may help scientists discover new properties of nature. The as-yet theoretical Higgs boson, also called ""the God particle"" in popular parlance, could emerge within two or three years, Myers said in November. Evidence of supersymmetry -- the idea that every particle has a ""super partner"" with similar properties in a quantum dimension (according to some physics theories, there are hidden dimensions in the universe) -- could crop up as early as 2010. The collider has been dogged by problems. It made headlines late last year when a bird apparently dropped a ""bit of baguette"" into the accelerator, making the machine shut down. The incident was similar in effect to a standard power cut, said spokeswoman Katie Yurkewicz. Had the machine been going, there would have been no damage, but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures, she said. The collider achieved its first full-circle beam in September 2008 amid much celebration. But just nine days later, the operation was set back when one of the 25,000 joints that connect magnets in the LHC came loose and the resulting current melted or burned some important components of the machine, Myers said. The faulty joint has a cross-section of a mere two-thirds of an inch by two-thirds of an inch. Should Tuesday's experiment go as planned and scientists are able to establish 7 TeV collisions, the plan is to run them continuously for 18 to 24 months with a short technical stop at the end of 2010, CERN said. ""It will be the beginning of a long period of running the accelerator with beams at this energy,"" Sutton said. ""It's the period in which experiments will really start to collect data in this new energy region, where the potential for discoveries may be made."" Sutton compared the experiments to Christopher Columbus sailing for the New World in 1492, when he knew what he was looking for but didn't know what he might find. ""It's going into a new energy region,"" she said. ""It's a new territory in particle physics, so we're really just standing on the threshold of that, which is exciting for everybody here, of course.""","Large Hadron Collider to begin smashing proton beams at high speed .

"(CNN) -- A mohawk-wearing anarchist nicknamed ""Cyco"" was among five men arrested after allegedly conspiring to blow up a bridge about 15 miles south of Cleveland, according to court documents released Tuesday. Douglas L. Wright, 26, joined alleged co-conspirators Brandon L. Baxter, 20, a.k.a. ""Skabby,"" and Anthony Hayne, 37, a.k.a. ""Tony"" and ""Billy,"" in a plot authorities say homed in on the Brecksville-Northfield High Level Bridge, which spans the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and carries a four-lane highway. The men were arrested Monday evening in an FBI sting, but posed no real danger to the public because the explosives they had were inert and were controlled by an undercover FBI employee, the bureau said in a news release. The men have been charged with conspiracy and attempted use of explosive materials to damage physical property affecting interstate commerce. Connor C. Stevens, 20, and Joshua S. Stafford, 23, also were arrested, though their charges remain pending. Authorities say at least three of the men are self-proclaimed anarchists who had considered ""a series of evolving plots over several months."" ""The defendants stand charged based not upon any words or beliefs they might espouse, but based upon their own plans and actions,"" U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach said in a statement. They allegedly conspired to acquire plastic explosives (C-4) and build two bombs, affixing them to the bridge's support columns to be remotely detonated on Monday. Wright, Baxter and a man referred to as C.S. allegedly agreed to pay $900 for the devices, as well as separate riot gear, according to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court. At first, they'd considered using smoke grenades to distract local law enforcement in an effort to ""topple financial institution signs atop high rise buildings,"" the complaint says. Wright allegedly was interested in ""The Anarchist Cookbook,"" which describes the construction and use of explosives. ""We can make smoke bombs, we can make plastic explosives. ... It teaches you how to pick locks. It does everything,"" he is alleged to have said. According to the complaint, authorities were first alerted to the beginnings of the alleged scheme last year when an undercover FBI employee attended a protest group's event. The employee was deployed, the complaint said, because of ""an initial report of potential criminal activity and threats involving anarchists who would be attending."" During the event on October 21, 2011, an undercover FBI employee observed ""four suspicious males with walkie-talkie radios around their necks,"" the complaint says. Some of the men also donned black masks while carrying anarchist flags and ""acted differently than the other people in attendance."" The men were ""constantly moving through the crowd expressing displeasure at the crowd's unwillingness to act violently,"" it says. ""During a briefing between protesters and organizers, the organizers explained who would be arrested, emphasizing that they wanted everyone to conduct peaceful civil disobedience,"" the complaint adds. ""One of the original four men turned away and said 'f--- that' before the group of men walked away."" During the course of the alleged plot, however, Baxter later expressed reservations, saying that blowing up a bridge ""would not stop money flowing to the 'one percent,'"" the complaint says. The reference is catch-all phrase commonly employed by the Occupy movement in describing America's wealthy, particularly those atop the financial services industry, suggesting they hold disproportionate influence over the rest of the country. ""Occupy Cleveland,"" a local branch of the loosely organized protest that began last year in New York's Zuccotti Park, tweeted on Tuesday that it was ""shocked by these allegations."" ""We continue to be committed to creating social change through non-violence,"" the group said. Federal authorities say the year-long operation focused on the five suspects and had not targeted the broader Occupy movement. ""The FBI and the Department of Justice are not and do not investigate movements,"" Dettelbach told reporters Tuesday. ""We investigate crimes."" CNN National Security contributor Fran Townsend said she would expect no others to be named in the case. ""Typically in the course of an investigation, you let that investigation run until you identify all those you believe pose a threat and then you wrap them all up at the same time,"" she said. The men, whose attorneys could not be immediately reached for comment, were slated to appear before a federal magistrate in U.S. District court later Tuesday.","The suspects first planned to ""topple financial institution signs atop ... buildings,"" officials say .

"(CNN) -- Cambodia's war crimes court Friday rejected the appeal a man who ran a Khmer Rouge regime torture prison and instead increased the man's sentence to life imprisonment. Kaing Guek Eav, commonly known by his alias, Duch, was appealing his 2010 conviction and 35-year sentence arguing that he was just following orders of senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge regime. Duch was 67 at the time of his convictions, which was for war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture. He was was the head of the S-21 prison where about 14,000 people died. Few people taken to the prison made it out alive; only about a dozen were found by the Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in 1979. The judge, in announcing Duch's sentence in 2010 saiid he took into consideration that the defendant had expressed remorse, admitted responsibility and cooperated with the court. The judge also took into account the ""coercive environment"" of the Khmer Rouge, he said. Duch pleaded guilty and asked for forgiveness. In the trial, he argued that international law did not apply to him because he was just following orders. The tribunal began its work in 2007 after a decade of on-and-off negotiations between the United Nations and Cambodia over the structure and functioning of the court. The 2010 verdict was the court's first. At least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of Cambodia's population -- died under the 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime from execution, disease, starvation and overwork, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia.","""Duch"" ran a notorious torture prison in Cambodia in the 1970s .

"(CNN) -- Former workers at a California slaughterhouse involved in one of the largest meat recalls in years have been charged with knowingly processing and distributing meat from cancerous cows, according to court documents released Monday. Jesse J. Amaral Jr., also known as ""Babe Amaral,"" was the former President and General Manager of the Rancho Feeding Corporation in Petaluma. He and his former employees, Felix Sandoval Cabrera and Eugene Corda, have all been charged with conspiring to sell and distribute ""adulterated, misbranded, and uninspected"" meat. Prosecutors allege that Amaral directed Corda and Cabrera to circumvent inspection procedures for certain cows with signs of epithelioma of the eye, also known as ""cancer eye."" This included directing employees to carve ""USDA Condemned"" stamps out of certain cow carcasses and to process them for sale and distribution, despite having been rejected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinarian. Corda and Cabrera are also alleged to have replaced the heads of sick cows with those of healthy ones, placing the healthy heads next to the bodies of cows whose eyes had signs of cancer. The switch occurred during the inspectors' lunch break, prosecutors said. Massive recall . Between January 2013 and January 2014, Rancho processed and distributed meat from approximately 101 condemned cattle and approximately 79 cancer eye cows, according to court documents. Nearly 9 million pounds of meat from the Rancho plant was recalled in February. The recalled beef may have reached 35 states and Guam, the Department of Agriculture said. Nestle USA also issued a voluntary recall in February of some types of Hot Pockets, saying that it had determined that ""a small quantity of meat from Rancho was used at Nestle's Chatsworth, California, production operation,"" which is devoted entirely to Hot Pockets sandwiches. Maximum sentence of 20 years . Amaral is also charged with sending false invoices to farmers, telling them that their cattle had died or been condemned and charging them ""handling fees"" for disposal of the carcasses, instead of compensating them for the sale price, prosecutors said. If convicted, Amaral, Cabrera, and Corda could face up to 20 years imprisonment and $250,000 in fines. CNN's attempts to reach the former workers and an attorney representing them were unsuccessful. An attorney for Amaral, Jeffrey Borstein, told CNN in May that his client didn't intend to hurt anyone. ""He takes responsibility for mistakes in judgment that were made. He made mistakes in judgment,"" Bornstein said. ""He regrets not being better able to recognize, respond and stop some of these alleged bad practices earlier. He's extremely remorseful."" USDA investigation . In June, after a CNN report exposed issues surrounding the beef recall, the U.S. House of Representatives authorized $1 million in additional funding to ""provide for a swift completion"" of the Department of Agriculture's investigation into the Rancho Feeding Corporation. Cabrera was a foreman responsible for Rancho's ""kill floor,"" where cattle were slaughtered, and Corda worked to receive and transport cattle for inspection and slaughter. The plant has since been sold. Opinion: Recalls and near misses -- Who's protecting us?

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN)  -- A problem with the landing gear, tire or brakes may have caused a Continental Airlines jet to veer off a runway into a 40-foot-deep ravine during its takeoff at Denver International Airport, a source told CNN Monday. A source tells CNN that it is possible a wheel locked up while the Continental jet took off from Denver. More than three dozen people were injured in Saturday's accident, most from bruises and broken bones as frightened passengers tried to flee a fire on board. There were no fatalities. The source said early indications show a problem with the landing gear, tires or brakes could have caused a wheel to lock up. The National Transportation Safety Board did an ""initial readout"" of the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder recovered from the wreckage Sunday, a government aviation official said. Robert Sumwalt, a National Transportation Safety Board member leading the investigation team, said Monday at a news conference that both recorders contained ""good data"" and that the voice recorder was audible. ""Tonight, we should have some overall characterization of what was said in that cockpit,"" he told reporters. He would not confirm that a problem with the landing gear, tire or brakes may have caused the accident, saying the investigation was still in its early stages. Sumwalt also said he could not identify the captain and first officer, nor say whether either was hospitalized or who was actually flying the plane. Neither has been interviewed yet, though federal investigators are arranging for an interview with the first officer. A knowledgeable source told CNN the captain was hospitalized in serious condition. On Monday investigators were to begin interviewing crew members, pilots and passengers to help determine what caused the accident. From the air, a crack is visible wrapping around the middle part of the plane. ""The captain has not been interviewed at this time,"" Sumwalt said. ""We want to do it as soon as we can but want to be respectful of the captain's mental condition. ... We want to make sure he or she is mentally ready."" When pressed about when that interview would take place, he said, ""Everybody wants to get the NTSB interview over with as soon as possible. ... The pilots want to get it over with because it's something you get nervous about."" Preliminary findings may come within a week, Sumwalt said, but a full investigation could take a year. Gabriel Trejos was about to board Continental Flight 1404, bound for Houston, with his wife and 1-year-old when gate officials announced the plane was experiencing ""engine problems,"" Trejos told CNN affiliate KUSA. But, ""shortly after that, they said everything is fine. There's going to be an on-time flight,"" Trejos said.  Continental spokeswoman Julie King, however, said she was unaware of any announcement of engine problems on the flight. The Boeing 737 taxied down the runway at Denver International Airport and accelerated. It was dark, 6:18 p.m., and the Trejos' baby, leaning against the window, giggled at the lights on the tarmac. ""All of a sudden, it was too much light,"" said Maria Trejos, who is four months pregnant. ""We felt the plane veer to the left. My husband was holding my son and we felt some bumpiness and I thought it was just turbulence,"" she said. ""I looked to the side and all of a sudden there was this giant fireball behind my husband's head. I have this image of him just grabbing my son's head and just pulling him toward himself and all of a sudden we felt this heat."" She felt a bump, she said. ""And it felt like we were airborne for a couple of seconds.""  Watch Maria and Gabriel Trejos describe the crash » . The plane skidded off the runway, its wheels disintegrating. It slammed into a ravine, its fuel tanks leaking, and caught fire. Luggage fell out of overhead bins that had begun to melt. Passengers panicked and shoved and stepped over each other. One yelled, ""The plane is going to explode!"" said Gabriel Trejos, who was clutching his child and feared that the buckling seats would ""squash"" them both. The couple fought their way into a line of people scrambling to get out of the back of the plane. Some were trying to get their luggage first. ""I just wanted to get out of there,"" Gabriel Trejos said. He noticed that the escape chute in the middle of the plane had fewer people huddled near it. The Trejos dashed for that and escaped. All 115 people on board survived the crash.  Forty people were injured, two critically, authorities said. Bone fractures and bruises were the most common complaint, and there appeared to be no burn victims, fire officials said. Of the dozens taken to hospitals, five people remained hospitalized late Sunday, Sumwalt said. In the airport after the ordeal, passengers used terms like ""rag doll"" to describe how they felt during the nightmare. ""It was incredibly violent,"" Jeb Tilly told CNN affiliate KPRC. ""It was a big left-hand turn and we sort of started bouncing a lot as if we were in a roller coaster, you know, you're kind of getting tossed around in your seat. ""And then there was a lot of silence all of a sudden. We took a big drop and when we hit the ground, that's when the thing really got kind of screwy,"" Tilly continued. ""I think that's when the plane cracked in half at that point and all the overhead baggage compartments broke open and fell down."" At a news conference late Saturday, Patrick Hynes, chief of the airport division of the Denver Fire Department, said crews responding to the scene ""had a difficult time narrowing down exactly where the airplane ended up,"" but found it north of a firehouse. When they arrived, firefighters found the plane on fire in a ravine about 200 yards from the runway, with its wheels sheared off and fuel tanks leaking, Hynes said. ""They [firefighters] described a surreal scene when they pulled up, heavy fire on the right side of the aircraft, all chutes deployed from both sides of the aircraft, people evacuating and walking up the hillside towards them,"" he said. Hynes said the entire right side of the jet was in flames and ""a heck of a firefight"" followed. ""There was significant extension of fire into the cabin portion,"" he said. ""There's significant fire damage inside with the luggage compartment described as melting and dropping down into the seats."" Hynes said fuel from the aircraft leaked for several hours after the accident. CNN's Kathleen Koch and Susan Roesgen contributed to this report.","NEW: Investigators should be able to listen to cockpit audio by tonight .

"(CNN) -- The bitter back-and-forth between former President Bill Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama has led a prominent black lawmaker to tell the former president Monday to ""chill a little bit."" Sen. Barack Obama marches in a Martin Luther King memorial parade in Columbia, South Carolina, Monday. The two Democratic front-runners, Illinois Sen. Obama and New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, are locked in a battle for the key South Carolina primary this Saturday. As their campaign sparring continues, the Illinois senator seems to be spending almost as much time responding to Hillary Clinton's husband as he does to the candidate herself. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, one of the most powerful African-Americans in Congress, weighed in on the feud Monday, saying it was time for Bill Clinton to watch his words. Bill Clinton has delivered full-throated attacks on Obama in recent days, accusing him of overstating his opposition to the war in Iraq, complaining about Obama's union supporters in the Nevada caucuses last weekend and blasting his relatively mild praise for Republican icon Ronald Reagan during a Las Vegas newspaper interview. Obama adviser David Axelrod said the Clintons have been playing ""good cop, bad cop,"" with him wielding the club while she stays positive. And Obama said Monday that Bill Clinton ""continues to make statements that aren't supported by the facts."" Bill Clinton's attacks on Obama, Clyburn said in a CNN interview, were unfair because a former president's viewpoint ""carries with it extra weight.""  Watch Clyburn tell Clinton to 'chill' » . ""I think they would say in 'Gullah Geechee' country he needs to chill a little bit. I hope he understands what that means,"" Clyburn told CNN. ""I can understand him wanting to defend his wife's honor and his own record, and that is to be expected. But you can't do that in a way that won't engender the kind of feelings that seem to be bubbling up as a result of this."" ""Gullah Geechee"" refers to African-Americans who live in South Carolina's Low Country region near the Atlantic coast. ""He is revered in many sections of the African-American community, and I think he can afford to tone it down,"" Clyburn added. Black voters make up roughly half the Democratic electorate in the state, and Obama seems to have reversed Clinton's early lead in that demographic, posting a huge edge over the New York senator in most recent polls of African-American primary voters. It's a delicate situation for the Clintons, who have spent the month dealing with verbal missteps that have made waves in the African-American community. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Clyburn said he was disappointed with comments from Hillary Clinton that some took to suggest President Lyndon Johnson had more to do with passing the Civil Rights Act than Martin Luther King Jr. ""We have to be very, very careful about how we speak about that era in American politics,"" the South Carolina congressman said at the time. ""It is one thing to run a campaign and be respectful of everyone's motives and actions, and it is something else to denigrate those. That bothered me a great deal."" He also expressed frustration over Bill Clinton's recent remark that the characterization of Obama's record on Iraq as consistently antiwar is a ""fairy tale."" Last week, Clyburn said it was time for both Hillary Clinton and Obama to move on. Clyburn insists he will not endorse any presidential candidate, upholding a pledge to the candidates and to the Democratic Party that he would stay out of the race ahead of his state's key January vote. After losing the caucus tally in Nevada this weekend, the Obama campaign took aim at the former president.  In an interview that aired on ABC Monday morning, Obama himself took on the former president, saying that he feels as if he's running against both Clintons. In the interview, Obama said the former president has been misrepresenting both ""my record of opposition to the war in Iraq"" and ""our approach to organizing in Las Vegas,"" as the dispute over Saturday's Nevada caucus vote continues to grow.  Watch Bill Clinton accuse the Obama campaign of strong-arm tactics » . ""It's very clear that Bill Clinton is playing fast and loose with the facts,"" adviser Axelrod said. ""It's been a little crass. As someone who supported him and respects him, I think it's disappointing."" The Clinton campaign attributed the Obama camp's anger to sour grapes over the Saturday caucus vote results. ""We understand Sen. Obama is frustrated by his loss in Nevada, but the facts are the facts,"" said campaign spokesman Phil Singer. ""President Clinton is a huge asset to our campaign and will continue talking to the American people."" And Bill Clinton himself showed no sign of backing down. During a campaign stop in Buffalo, New York, Sunday night, the former president went after Obama for his comments to a Reno, Nevada, editorial board last week that President Reagan had been a transformational president. Obama ""said President Reagan was the engine of innovation and did more, had a more lasting impact on America than I did,"" Bill Clinton said. ""And then the next day he said, 'In the '90s the good ideas came out from the Republicans,' which will be costly, maybe, down the road for him because it's factually not accurate.""

"Lamu, Kenya (CNN) -- In many ways, it seems like time has given Lamu a wide berth. The East African island, perched placidly off Kenya's coast, is home to one of the oldest continuously inhabited Swahili towns -- an ethnic group in East Africa who have lived here for more than 700 years. There are no cars on the island -- the streets are too narrow and winding. Instead, locals rely on donkeys for transport on the land, and dhows to travel throughout the archipelago. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Lamu was once the most important international trade center in East Africa -- as is evidenced by the Arab, Indian, Persian and European influences in the local architecture. The most Swahili feature, however, is the use of coral stone, which reigns supreme throughout the island. Not only is coral stone strong, it's a few degrees cooler than cement, making it an ideal building resource in a region known for its sweltering heat. In fact, coral stone has a long history in the construction of Lamu, as is evidenced by the Takwa ruins -- the remains of what was once a thriving trading town. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Takwa attracted merchants from across the globe. ""The Arabs were here, the Indians were here, the Chinese,"" says local historian Mohamed Ali. ""The Swahili people used to trade with a lot of foreign people."" Much like Lamu's more modern buildings, the relics of this ancient commercial hub are mainly made from coral stone and lime -- though foreign influences abound. ""The Indians introduced arches and balconies,"" notes Ali. Foreigners -- lured by the charming architecture and relaxed way of life -- continue to flock to Lamu town, with many buying and renovating the old Swahili mansions, or simply building new ones. As a result, locals often find themselves outbid when buying property. Local artisan Swabry Maawy, for instance, recalls the difficulty he had in procuring his dream house. ""I was so in love with this house. I put in an offer and people from Europe put their offer. I put in another offer, they put in another offer, and somehow I got it. It was very expensive for me,"" he says. He hopes to preserve the past with the building, especially as he sees more foreigners investing in Lamu's future, a new twist on its historic role as a hub for international trade.

"(CNN) -- Why was Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 flying over war-torn eastern Ukraine? ""We, along with hundreds of other airlines, have flown that route safely for quite some time,"" Hugh Dunleavy, commercial director for Malaysia Airlines, told CNN's Saima Mohsin over the weekend. ""Primarily we flew that route because we were advised that this was a safe corridor and there would be no incidents."" Dunleavy said the plane, which was traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, adjusted its altitude on its way across Europe under the direction of air traffic control. Now, he said the airline is reassessing the route it uses for that flight. And since Thursday's crash, commercial airlines that usually cross eastern Ukraine on their flights to Europe, Asia and elsewhere have been detouring away from the volatile region. But far beyond Ukraine's borders, analysts say the incident could pave the way for new guidelines for how close planes can fly to conflict zones. ""The rules in aviation are written in blood, or a tombstone mentality if you like,"" CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said. ""What happens is, people die, and things get safer."" David Soucie, a CNN safety analyst and former FAA safety inspector, said the situation highlights the need for change in an antiquated system that has what he calls a ""flaw in the evaluation of the risk."" Eight unanswered questions . ""There had been aircraft shot down just prior to this,"" Soucie said. ""Someone should have taken action."" Last week Eurocontrol, the agency responsible for coordinating European airspace, said Ukrainian authorities had closed airspace in the region below 32,000 feet, but it was open at the level Flight 17 was flying (33,000 feet). ""There's a lot of questions to be asked in a lot of different places,"" O'Brien said. ""Malaysia, for example, what about the airline policy? What did they inform crews and flight dispatchers about flying through that particular part of the world? And why didn't government officials close off that airspace completely? 32,000 feet, that's a completely arbitrary number."" The president of Dubai's Emirates airline is calling for an international meeting of carriers to come up with a response to the downing of the plane, Reuters reported on Sunday. The U.N.'s International Civil Aviation Organization can't close airspace, Emirates President Tim Clark told Reuters, ""but they can issue advisories and they may be a little more active."" And national regulators ""may start getting involved a little more than they have,"" Clark said, according to Reuters. ""They have perhaps left airlines to their own devices."" The airline chief's comments are a good sign that changes soon could be in the works, O'Brien said. Les Abend, a CNN aviation analyst and commercial pilot, said before last week's crash, pilots weren't worried about missiles hitting planes they were flying. ""None of us, I think, would have conceived that kind of devastation from a surface-to-air missile,"" he said. ""Evading missiles (is) not part of our training. That's just something that's not in our vocabulary at this point and time."" But now, he said, guidelines for pilots will likely change. ""Now we've got a new threat that we've got to deal with,"" he said. ""Now we've lost lives."" Malaysia Airlines retires flight number, offers full refunds . Who were the victims?

Ford, who is reprising the Han Solo role that brought him fame in the first ""Star Wars"" in 1977, broke his left leg in an on-set accident at London's Pinewood Studios on June 12, according to his publicist. The 71-year-old actor underwent surgery and began rehab on his leg last month, spokeswoman Ina Treciokas said in a statement to CNN. The two new faces Ford will see when he returns to the production are American actress Crystal Clarke and British actor Pip Andersen. They were chosen through an open casting call by Lucasfilm and Disney executives starting seven months ago, according to a statement. Producers considered 37,000 hopefuls who showed up in 11 U.S. and British cities, and another 30,000 who submitted online applications, they said. ""The Star Wars universe has always been about discovering and nurturing young talent and in casting Episode VII we wanted to remain absolutely faithful to this tradition,"" Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said in the announcement. ""We are delighted that so many travelled to see us at the open casting calls and that we have been able to make Crystal and Pip a part of the film."" Clarke was born in Belleville, New Jersey, but later moved to Nashville, according to her biography on the Internet Movie Database. The bio and producers' announcement did not list her age, but she will graduate this year from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow, her bio said. Her professional acting resume is short. Clarke's first feature film role will not hit theaters until next year, when she acts opposite Pierce Brosnan and William Hurt in ""The Moon and the Sun."" Pip Andersen's budding career is built on his skills as ""a practitioner of parkour, a discipline that involves propelling oneself through any given environment with incredible grace and agility,"" the release said.

"Chicago (CNN) -- Kain Colter actually got this idea sitting in a college classroom at Northwestern University. The 21-year-old quarterback, soon to graduate with a degree in psychology, is taking the day off from training for the NFL draft to take the stand at a National Labor Relations Board hearing today and testify against his own university and on behalf of fellow football players. The goal: an attempt to revolutionize the way collegiate athletes are treated. Colter, with the help of a team of lawyers and the National College Players Association, is leading an effort to unionize the Northwestern football team. Backed by the overwhelming majority of the team, Colter will kick off a days-long hearing before the National Labor Relations Board in Chicago. ""Student athletes don't have a voice,"" Colter said at a press conference last month. ""They don't have a seat at the table. The current model resembles a dictatorship with the NCAA putting rules and regulations on students without their input."" A union would certainly change that. It would put the athletes in a position to bargain, to demand things that college athletes have never had before -- like stipends, continuing medical coverage after graduation, more concussion testing and even a portion of the profits of the multibillion dollar windfall created by college football and basketball. Never before have current players been so vocal in standing up for themselves. It's a bold move, given the incredibly controlling nature of collegiate athletics. ""These guys at Northwestern are really an inspiration, not just to other football and basketball players and athletes, but these are young men standing together, 70 to 80 guys and they're taking on a multibillion industry because they know it's the right thing to do,"" said Ramogi Huma, president of the NCPA, which last season organized the All Players United wristband protest in support of NCAA reform at Georgia Tech, Northwestern and the University of Georgia. ""If they win, it immediately sets a standard,"" Huma said. Colter came to Huma with this idea last year, and Huma has been helping him with resources to see it through. If they win, it could have a huge effect on the structure of the NCAA. Despite some quiet resistence at Georgia and Georgia Tech against the players who participated in the All Players United wristband protest in September, Northwestern leaders have been vocally supportive of the leadership exhibited by the team. They don't, however, agree with the idea. At the NLRB hearing, it's expected to present a handful of experts who will argue that college sports are not a commercial venue. ""Northwestern teaches its students to be leaders and independent thinkers,"" a lengthy statement says, in part. But it continues ""we believe that a collective bargaining process at Northwestern would not advance the discussion of these topics. ... Our student-athletes are not employees, but students."" The NCAA, which is not a party to the case, also put out a statement opposing the move. ""This union-backed attempt to turn student-athletes into employees undermines the purpose of college: an education,"" said Donald Remy, the NCAA's chief legal officer, in a statement. ""Student-athletes are not employees, and their participation in college sports is voluntary."" A seat at the table . So, could it work? New York University labor law professor Richard Epstein said it could, but he cautions that it may take away what fans like about college sports. With unions come bargaining, the potential for strikes and lack of stability. Imagine pickets instead of rivalry games, he said. ""It's just very difficult to be confident that if you try to put this on the opposite side of the NCAA, it's going to improve things,"" he said. However, he does think they have a shot at winning this fight. NYU recently settled a case with graduate students who argued they were both students and employees of the university and deserved rights. But even if the athletes at Northwestern succeed, it could be years before they see any change, and it's unclear how it would affect other teams. It's very likely the players who took the risk to stand up and say something will never see the benefits. The hearing that starts Tuesday is expected to last through the week. The judge has a month to make a decision, and appeals, which could take years to hash out, may potentially go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. ""Comprehensive reform will always be elusive unless players have a seat at the table, just like the NBA, just like the NFL,"" Huma said. There's been growing support for NCAA reform, mostly because of former UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon suing the NCAA for rights to his own likeness. And of course there's long been a debate about whether the for-profit sport athletes deserve a cut of the money they generate. Lost in that, though, are stories like former Northwestern player Jeff Yarbrough. When he was recruited in 2003, he was among the top six fastest teens in the state of Illinois. But he fractured both legs during his college career and doctors had to put metal rods and screws in both shins. He's in so much pain, he can barely run. He's only 27 years old. ""I'm like a 45-year-old man. I can't move,"" he said. Huma said most people don't know that the NCAA doesn't even mandate that colleges cover the cost of medical expenses for current players, and there's no help at all for former ones. Each year, $30 million is generated by Northwestern football, Huma said, ""yet (players) have no guarantee that medical costs will be covered."" Yarbrough wants to have the rods removed from his legs, but the procedure could cost him $20,000 to $30,000 in out-of-pocket expenses, money he doesn't have to spare working as a teacher in Chicago.

"(CNN) -- Emeka Okereke is a hard man to pin down. When we spoke earlier this month, he had just arrived in Lagos from Abuja, a few days after returning to Nigeria from Chad and just before heading to Accra to put together a photography exhibition in the Ghanaian capital. ""It's been a long time since I spent three months in one place,"" said the celebrated 33-year-old Nigerian photographer, whose work has been exhibited in art festivals across the world. ""I believe so much in movement -- movement in the physical sense, movement in the metaphysical sense, so I am always moving; this is basically who I am."" Describing himself as a ""border being"" who is always in motion, award-winning Okereke works and lives between Paris, Berlin and Lagos. But his constant need for movement is most clearly manifested through Invisible Borders, an artist-led project he co-founded in 2009 with the aim of finding new ways of portraying the complexities of life in contemporary Africa. Read this: Glorious colors in the desert . Once a year, the project brings together a troupe of about a dozen African artists and photographers to brave tough terrains, adverse weather and brusque border officials as they embark on a road trip across parts of the continent. Traveling for several weeks inside a crammed minivan, the intrepid participants use photography and art to capture the stories of the people they encounter, encourage cultural exploration and cut through geographical divides. ""We're talking about trans-African exchange,"" explains Okereke. ""Transcending those limitations and those pre-definitions that exist about the continent,"" he adds. ""What we're saying is that as artists we're not road builders; we don't build roads but we may as well build a trans-African highway of the mind."" The first ""Trans-African Road Trip Project"" was competed four years ago when the team traveled from Lagos to Bamako, the capital of Mali, and one year later they headed further west, all the way to Dakar, Senegal. For the third edition, in 2011, the group journeyed eastwards, passing through Nigeria, Chad and Sudan to reach the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. Last year, Invisible Borders planned to travel from Lagos to Lubumbashi in DR Congo but the trip was cut short after suffering a number of setbacks. ""Rather than continue and hurrying through places to Congo, we decided to spend more days in Cameroon and Gabon,"" explains Okereke. ""We thought we would get more out of the road trip that way; besides, it is not really about the destination but the journey itself."" Read this: Photos show Congo in new light . Four years into the project, the experience has been both demanding and thrilling, intense and inspiring. The group's refusal to pay any bribes often results in hours of waiting at border crossings. When not stuck at customs, there is the problem of the elements; last year, the tenacious artists spent four days stuck in the mud, pushing and digging all the way through the sinking soil to make it out of a neglected road near the Cameroonian and Nigerian border. And then there's the risk of upsetting authorities; in 2011, the artists were arrested in Chad's capital N'Djamena for eight hours after taking photos in one of the city's markets . But it's not all about ordeals. The journeys are also full of high points. ""One of the times that was very inspiring and very surprising was our getting into Khartoum,"" said Okereke. He admits that the prospect of visiting the Sudanese capital had made the team nervous, because of the images of conflict that have shaped the narrative around Sudan in recent years. ""Sudan is not a place people just wake up one morning and try to go to -- it is the place you hear in the news, "" said Okereke. ""But when we got into Khartoum it was just amazing,"" he recalls. ""Everybody was just so welcoming and lovely; it had nothing to do with the war you'd heard in the news. That made us think that we have to keep doing this project even 50 years from now because there is a whole lot to know about our continent and about our neighbors."" Read this: Africa's magnificent views . Throughout its journeys, the team makes several stops in major cities to join forces with local artists, conduct workshops and exchange ideas. As an extension of the road trip, Invisible Borders members also often return to the cities they've visited to exhibit the work they created whilst passing through there. The goal, Okereke said, is to engage with young minds and create a network of people that will push forward broader discussions about 21st century Africa. ""Everywhere we go to there is a lot of optimism, especially from the young people,"" said Okereke. ""A lot of people are waiting to be inspired; a lot of people are waiting to find something to get into,"" he adds. ""And this is what is beautiful now about Africa -- when people see something like this, they immediately imagine themselves being able to do it as well."" For its next journey in 2014, the team has set its most ambitious goal to date: completing its first intercontinental road trip, from Lagos to Sarajevo, Bosnia. ""The reason why we're making this is because we believe that part of Invisible Borders and trans-Africanism is to be proactive,"" said Okereke. ""We think that now it's a good time to address the relationship between Africa and Europe and talk about it,"" he adds. ""To make a road trip toward there and sort of try to touch that line between Africa and Europe.""","Every year a group of African photographers, artists, takes road trip .

"(CNN) -- China's passion for Transformer robots might not follow computer logic, but it's no secret. The stories are geek legends -- from repairmen building 20 giant autobots out of junk in a small village in Shandong to the true romantic who spent 10 months building an eight-meter-high Optimus Prime to propose to his girlfriend. Then there was the reality series that picked four Chinese actors for minor roles in the upcoming ""Transformers 4: Age of Extinction,"" a good part of which is supposed to take place in China. It makes sense, therefore, that the Transformers 30th Anniversary Expo is being held in Macau this week. Running June 1 to October 5 at the Venetian Macao, the new Transformers Expo showcases more than a thousand toys and collectibles in 10 different zones of the resort's giant event space. Features include a replica of AllSpark (we're told it's the soul of a Transformer) and a laser grid to test visitors' sense of balance. There's also a 3D hologram and a seven-meter-tall likeness of Autobots leader Optimus Prime. A large number of the exhibits have been lent to the Expo by two ""super collectors"" from Hong Kong and Shanghai. For anyone hoping to build up their own battalion of robots in disguise, the Expo seems like a good place to start. Anniversary keepsake figurines of Optimus Prime, Grimlock, Starscream, Soundwave and Bumblebee have been produced just for the exhibition and are being sold on site. Those who want all five will have to keep coming back -- a different figurine is being sold every month.

"(CNN) -- Users of social-networking sites such as Facebook risk losing control of their personal information because they are not fully aware of the implications for their privacy, a freedom of information expert warned Wednesday. Facebook was forced to revert to its old user-ownership policy following a backlash from users. Data-protection specialist Mark Gleeson told CNN that social networking users should be very careful about what information they post on the Web. He said users should make sure they understand who could access their profiles, and how that information could be used. They also should familiarize themselves with sites' privacy options, he said. ""It is very important to take steps yourself to understand what is going on with your personal information,"" Gleeson said. ""Once it's out there it's very difficult to get it back. You can lose control over it."" Facebook, currently the world's most popular social-networking site, was forced to back down Wednesday after many members revolted against a change to its user information policy, which would have granted the site permanent rights to all photos and postings even after a user had closed down an account. But Gleeson, of UK law firm Addleshaw Goddard, said the case raises other issues of privacy concerning social networking, such as the security of personal data and whether information could end up in the hands of marketing companies. He also said that employers have been known to visit such sites to check personal details about prospective workers. Young people, for whom communicating with friends via social-networking sites is often second nature, should be particularly careful about what they post online, Gleeson said. ""They don't have the level of suspicion that other people have about the Internet because they just see it as a way to communicate and understanding the implications won't be in the forefront of their minds,"" he said. Gleeson said the Facebook backlash may have blown up out of a misunderstanding over the site's attempt to clarify content ownership. But he said the way the company went about the change provoked alarm among some users of the site. ""It comes down to how you deliver the message,"" Gleeson said. ""If you change your terms and conditions and remove a section and leave it at that without bringing it properly to people's attention you're going to get suspicion."" iReport.com: Your thoughts on Facebook's about-face . Data-protection laws differ from country to country. But Gleeson said Web sites generally face a balancing act between meeting their legal requirements to explain their policy towards personal information -- often in the form of dense terms and conditions pages written in ""legalese"" --  and providing the same information in a way accessible to users. ""One of the requirements of data protection is that personal information is processed fairly and lawfully. Fairness is all about telling people what you are going to do with their information and being clear and transparent,"" Gleeson said. ""The difficulty is that in many cases you've got a tension between insuring that you tell people what you need legally to tell them against making that clear and understandable."" iReport.com: Too much information posted online? But Gleeson said it was in sites' interests to treat their users fairly. He said the Facebook case demonstrates that social-networking services need to keep their users on their side -- or risk losing them to rivals. ""It's always in the interests of reputable sites to treat information fairly and treat their users fairly because the last thing you want to be seen to do is alienate people,"" he said. ""When people feel that they can't trust a site then they will go elsewhere.""","Expert: Social-networking site users risk losing control of personal information .

"New York (CNN) -- Women have long dominated the heated discussion around gender equality. But one group not engaging in the conversation is men, says Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. What's more, in her new bestseller ""Lean In,"" Sandberg argues gender parity is impossible without them. ""I think it is too hard for men to talk about gender,"" says Sandberg. ""We have to let men talk about this ... because we need men to talk about this if it is ever going to change."" And with men at the helm of most large companies, engaging the other 50% of the population in the gender debate is the key to gender equality, she says. ""I don't think men should be part of ""Lean In"" or part of equality because it's nice for women. They need to be part of it for themselves ... as managers and as peers in the workforce this is a competitive advantage for men."" If 86% of the top jobs are held by men and they tend to be older than the women who have just joined their companies, inviting this group of decision makers to help mentor women into top roles is the logical way forward, explains Sandberg. ""[For] every man out there, it should be a badge of honor to mentor young women. Not something you're ashamed to do, not something you're afraid someone will assume something bad, but a badge of honor that you are willing to spend your time giving the benefit of your experience to young women in the workforce. They need it."" As a female leader who has only worked for men and been mentored by men, her track record and success is proof in itself. ""I've never worked for a woman. Most women, if they get senior, have never worked for a woman, because again, 86 percent of the top jobs are held by men. I've had great mentors and great sponsors and part of Lean In is trying to help people find the right way to develop those mentors and sponsors."" As a Harvard graduate, she was selected to join the World Bank by her former professor, Larry Summers and later went on to become his Chief-of-Staff at the U.S. Treasury after working at McKinsey and earning her M.B.A. In the midst of moving to Google and then Facebook, Sandberg wed and had two children, a boy and a girl. But Sandberg's book -- what she calls ""a sort"" of feminist manifesto -- hasn't been without critics. The Facebook executive received overwhelming reactions from female columnists at USA Today and the New York Times as well as authors specializing in gender workplace issues. One notable reaction came from Avivah Wittenberg-Cox, who runs a global management consultancy, 20-first, that helps companies achieve greater gender balance. In a recent Harvard Business Review article, Cox argues Sandberg is insulting women by suggesting they need to be more like men to succeed and even suggests she's blaming them. ""We've never, in all of human history, seen a generation of brighter, better educated or more ambitious women,"" she writes. ""They have the keys. We just still haven't figured out how to adapt our organizations to optimize their talents."" But Sandberg explains her point is quite the contrary. ""I'm not telling women to be like men. I'm telling us to evaluate what men and women do in the workforce and at home without the gender bias."" What's more, Sandberg has also noticed it is women, not men who've been most vocal about the book. INTERACTIVE: 10 most powerful women in tech . ""Most of the debate about ""Lean In"" has been women, especially the first couple weeks before the book was out. The most surprising thing was that no man said a word. I couldn't find a man writing a line, not saying a word."" Sandberg isn't just pointing out the stalled feminist revolution; she also offers a solution with Leanin.org, a not-for-profit foundation that will help spur change by offering women the ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals. Funded by her book and corporate sponsors, the foundation will allow professional women to review social science research, share stories and receive online training and practical advice on career development -- to help women ""take a seat at the table"". ""Lean In is not about fixing women. And it's certainly not about any one person doing this on their own,"" she asserts . ""Lean In is about all of us coming together to understand the stereotypes that are holding women back and fix them. And to start having an honest conversation about women in the workplace.""","Men need to engage in the workplace gender equality debate, says Sandberg .

"(CNN) -- I can't fully understand why a bigoted rancher in Nevada warrants as much media coverage asâ€”or more coverage thanâ€”a presidential trip to Asia, the delay of a major job-creating infrastructure project or the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. But apparently it does. And like nearly all stories that involve race and politics, the media has covered rancher Cliven Bundy in a way that makes an honest conversation about race in America even more difficult. Take, for instance, a conversation CNN anchor Carol Costello had with my colleague, Republican National Committee Communications Director Sean Spicer, on Friday morning. Somehow Costello made the illogical conclusion that a racist rancher's rant has implications for the Republican National Committee's minority engagement efforts. Republicans ""don't really invite minorities in,"" she insisted without evidence. Spicer explained that the RNC is working to help the entire party listen and connect with the black community and with Americans of all backgrounds. He noted that not only is the RNC building long-term relationships and a permanent presence in black communities, but also that the RNC has hired a number of black staff members, both those focused on engaging with the black community and those who are not. That wasn't good enough for Costello. She didn't believe the RNC actually hired black staff members, especially senior level staff. So she demanded that Spicer name names of black people working at the Republican National Committee. She wanted a list of black staffers. That crosses a line. Is Costello hosting a news program or a dog and pony show? Carol Costello: GOP's problem wooing African-American voters . As a senior-level staff member at the RNC who happens to be black, my job is to help the committee by developing communications and media strategy. My job is not to be put on display every time a news anchor wants to determine whether a political organization has the right number of people of color. How does that advance the discourse on race and politics in America? That would be pandering. It's wrong. Costello, and others in the media who do the same thing, are perpetuating a double standard. When black Republicans appear in the media, they suggest that Republicans are just checking a box by putting a black person on screen. When we don't put ourselves on display, they assume we don't exist. That's pretty revealing of their personal biases. That's also a dangerous double standard. Which brings us to the even bigger issue at hand. When someone who isn't even a Republican elected official or candidate says something disgusting and offensive, the media goes into overdrive to discuss how this is terrible for the Republican Party. But when Democrat elected officials, including a sitting governor and sitting vice president, say something racist or offensive, you don't hear a peep. They get a free pass. The latest example comes from President Obama's home state. Last week, the campaign of Democrat Gov. Pat Quinn promoted an article on Twitter that labeled black Republicans as race traitors and said they were akin to Jewish Nazi sympathizers. Yes, a sitting Democrat governor's campaign was publicizing racist material. If you didn't hear about it, that proves my point. It was abhorrent, but national coverage was almost nonexistent until CNN.com finally posted an article late Thursday. But did the media demand Democrats apologize and ask the Democratic National Committee for comment? Did they consider asking DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a prominent Jewish leader, to denounce the governor? Absolutely not. It was reminiscent of their ambivalent coverage when Vice President Joe Biden, during the 2012 campaign, told a group of black voters that his political opponents would ""put y'all back in chains."" That was disgusting rhetoric, but the vice president is a Democrat, so it wasn't breaking news. It was just Joe being Joe, as his fans in the media like to say. Again, it's a double standard. Racist language has no place in our political discourse. It's unacceptable whenever and wherever it's used. And yes, journalists, that includes the Democratic Party. Americans aren't hearing the full story when you're only covering one side of it. If we're going to defeat the racism that persists in America, we have to have intelligent conversations about it. The media should neither elevate it nor reduce it to some petty partisan game. But more often than not, media outlets are failing to meet that standard. That was the case on Friday. Let's hope next time it's different. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Tara Wall says CNN and the media have been unfair in its criticism of GOP and race .

"(CNN) -- A man who police said was 107 years old was killed in a confrontation with SWAT officers Saturday night. Police were called to a home in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where suspect Monroe Isadore was. ""When they arrived, they were able to determine that an aggravated assault had occurred against two people at the residence,"" Lt. David E. Price, a Pine Bluff police spokesman, said in a statement. The two victims were led out of the house. It was not clear what role the suspect had in the aggravated assaults or what they were. When officers approached a bedroom where Isadore was hiding, he fired through the door, authorities said. None of the police officers was hit by the gunfire. They retreated to a safer area and called for additional help, including SWAT officers who started negotiations with the suspect. SWAT officers slipped a camera into the room where Isadore was holed up and saw he was armed with a handgun, Price said. After unsuccessful negotiations, officers slipped gas into the room through a window, he said, and Isadore fired rounds at them. The officers broke the bedroom door and hurled in a distraction device, and Isadore fired at them again, according to the spokesman's statement. Officers returned fire, killing him. It's unclear what distraction device was used. No more information was immediately available. CNN called the police department, but could not reach anyone. In 2010, there were about 53,000 people over age 100 in the United States, according to the latest Census numbers. Only 8% of them were older than 104.

"(CNN) -- President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt is on a mission -- to return his country to its rightful place as the ""indispensable"" Arab state after what he saw as the dangerous chaos of Muslim Brotherhood rule under his predecessor, Mohamed Morsy. He also is determined to resist the spread of Islamist militancy, now entrenched in Sinai and spilling into Egypt from Libya. Since leading the ouster of Morsy a year ago, el-Sisi has hounded the Muslim Brotherhood underground; hundreds of its members have been arrested and many sentenced to death. Morsy himself languishes in jail and is on trial for inciting murder and other offenses. El-Sisi is not the first Egyptian leader to fear Islamist militancy. In fact all but Morsy have suppressed it and one -- Anwar Sadat -- ultimately was its victim. And not coincidentally all but Morsy-- stretching back to Gamal Abdel Nasser -- were military men before becoming President. These two imperatives -- a sense of Egypt's historic role and the traditional animosity of the Egyptian military toward Islamist radicalism -- have propelled Egypt to take a central role in the on-off cease-fire talks to end the latest Gaza conflict. It helps that Egypt's intelligence service has deep experience of dealing with the Palestinian factions and Israel. Egypt's central role also is dictated by geography. It is the only Arab state to share a border with Gaza. If that border is to be reopened, Egypt will have to agree to any international monitoring mission to prevent banned goods -- the sort that would allow Hamas to re-arm -- from entering Gaza. But el-Sisi's government does not see itself as an ""honest broker"" between Israel and Hamas. El-Sisi shares the Israelis' loathing of Hamas, which itself sprang from the Muslim Brotherhood back in 1987 and which was recently labeled a terrorist organization by an Egyptian court. Egypt and Israel vs. Hamas . The Egyptian government is not directly negotiating with Hamas, but with a Palestinian delegation of which Hamas and Islamic Jihad are a small part. Any concessions won by the Palestinians will be claimed by the Palestinian Authority as much as Hamas. While Morsy embraced Hamas and warned Israel that it would ""pay a heavy price if it continues its aggression,"" Egypt and Israel are now in lockstep against a shared adversary. The last thing el-Sisi wants is any sort of Hamas victory, imagined or otherwise, that would appeal to the Arab street. One Israeli minister described the close cooperation with Cairo as ""an odd but very welcome moment"" after the hostility of the Morsy government. Who's who in Hamas? Perhaps that is why the first Egyptian cease-fire proposal was so readily accepted by Israel. In the words of one diplomat in the region, ""The Israelis knew Hamas would reject it, so they could accept it and look good, knowing that in a few hours they'd be able to resume the demilitarization of Gaza."" El-Sisi wants to see Gaza demilitarized as much as Israel does, not just because of Hamas but because of other actors there such as Islamic Jihad. Egypt faces a host of its own security problems that would only be aggravated by a strong militant presence in Gaza. Jihadist cells -- which Cairo claims have been aided by Hamas -- are now entrenched in the Sinai, a vast area that borders Gaza and whose lawlessness has challenged successive Egyptian governments. Which Mideast power brokers support Hamas? Islamist militant groups are also sprouting up along the western border with Libya. Last month, more than 20 Egyptian soldiers were killed when gunmen crossed the desert border and attacked a checkpoint at Wadi el-Gedid. El-Sisi responded by promising that ""terrorism will be uprooted from every part of Egypt."" But the attacks have continued. A gun battle Tuesday between security forces and suspected militants in the region of Matruh on the Mediterranean left nine dead, according to the Egyptian Interior Ministry. El-Sisi blames the Muslim Brotherhood for opening Egypt to an influx of jihadists. Despite its obvious motivations, Egyptian mediation is not without risk. CNN Exclusive: Inside the mind of Hamas' political leader . Goal of independent Palestine ingrained . The government's control of local media may have muffled sympathetic coverage of Gaza's plight and Hamas' resistance to Israel. One talk-show host, Mazhar Shahin, declared the Egyptian people were ""not ready to sacrifice even a single hair from the eyebrow"" in defense of Hamas. But Egyptians see the pan-Arab news channels, they see the destruction and suffering in Gaza, and even if there are no polls to prove it, they likely expect their government to lead the way in relieving it. For decades, pursuing the goal of an independent Palestine has been ingrained in Egypt's foreign policy. El-Sisi himself subscribes to that goal -- but with little urgency. He said last Saturday: ""We have a real opportunity to end this conflict for once and for all but we must give the Palestinian people real hope in a Palestinian state and its capital Eastern Jerusalem."" Then he added as a caveat: ""It might sound too early to talk about this but it must be our final goal."" Even so, Egypt cannot assume that the Palestinian Authority (PA) will be pliable negotiators. PA President Mahmoud Abbas is all too aware of the support in the West Bank for Hamas, whose flags have been hoisted by the hundreds at recent protests. The longer the conflict went on, the more the PA tilted toward Hamas' demands -- and especially its insistence on the immediate lifting of the blockade of Gaza as the price for a permanent cease-fire. What is Hamas' endgame in Gaza? The only game in town . Egyptian diplomacy will be tested to the full in reconciling Israel's insistence on the demilitarization of Gaza as the first step and the Palestinians' demand that borders -- land and maritime -- be reopened immediately and demilitarization form part of later negotiations. What is Israel's endgame in Gaza? But ultimately Hamas knows -- as do the other Palestinian factions -- that Egypt's is the only game in town. Hamas won't negotiate with the Israelis directly (the feeling is mutual). Nor will the Israelis have anything to do with Hamas' chief backers -- Qatar and Turkey. Israel wants el-Sisi to succeed. He's the sort of Egyptian leader with whom it can do business. And he's now a critical figure in an alliance that includes the Gulf monarchies (Qatar excepted) and the United States in seeking to stem the tide of Islamist militancy. But Israeli officials -- and many other observers -- believe there is another reason that el-Sisi aims to make himself the ""indispensable"" partner: to use that role to win much-needed international aid and credit for an economy on life-support. El-Sisi inherited a mess, with fuel subsidies alone costing the state nearly $20 billion a year, tourism collapsing and foreign exchange reserves dwindling. In overthrowing the Muslim Brotherhood, he quickly won financial backing from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, worth $12 billion according to some estimates. IMF in the future? If the el-Sisi government can introduce much-needed reforms to cut bureaucracy and begin to reduce subsidies, it may be able to negotiate the $4.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund that the Morsy government failed to secure. But it will need help fast: a sharp reduction in fuel subsidies last month generated scattered street protests. And yet subsidies still eat up one-third of the national budget, while education consumes less than six per cent. Exactly a year ago, el-Sisi gave an interview to the Washington Post, just after ousting Morsy. ""The pains and suffering of the people are too many. A lot of people don't know about the suffering. I am the most aware of the size of the problems in Egypt,"" he told the Post's Lally Weymouth. ""That is why I am asking: where is your support? The title of the article should be 'Hey America: Where is your support for Egypt?'"" He may now feel it is more deserved than ever. 3,300 rockets, 1,900 lives -- but is Mideast peace as far away as ever? Why are so many civilians dying in Hamas-Israel war? Has Gaza conflict brought new low in U.S.-Israel relationship?","Egypt takes a central role in the cease-fire talks to end the latest Gaza conflict .

"New York (CNN) -- In her ""uniform"" of a crisp, classic white shirt, Carolina Herrera exudes the kind of elegance and easy grace that has defined her fashion label for more than 30 years. It's a look that has been sought after by some of the world's leading ladies, from style icon Jackie Onassis to actress Renee Zellweger and comedian Tina Fey, who stepped out in a navy Herrera gown at this year's Oscars. Herrera's rise to the top of the cutthroat world of fashion started in 1981, when she launched her flagship Carolina Herrera brand in New York. Today, her empire encompasses the signature fashion collection, a bridal collection, fragrances and accessories. Herrera has more than 280 stores in 104 countries and all this brings in billions of dollars. Herrera says she was more interested in horses than fashion growing up in Caracas, Venezuela, where here father was Governor. But adds that she was lucky to always be surrounded by exquisitely dressed women. Today, the women in her life include her four daughters, two of whom also work for the Carolina Herrera brand. Here, Herrera speaks exclusively to CNN about style, business, family and getting ahead in a man's world. On building a business ... (Fashion is) a very difficult business, as you know, because fashion is a business. If you don't sell, then you are not in the business. You might be the best designer and you are so creative and new, have the most beautiful ideas, but if they all stay in your room and they don't go out to be worn by someone, then you are not in business. The most difficult (part) of this business is to have the right teams, because I (could not have done) everything I have done alone. If I (didn't) have my teams behind me, I wouldn't be sitting here. Fashion is a collaboration with many people. More from Leading Women: Women-only hotel floors take off . On the Herrera team ... I have a team, a fantastic president who takes care of the numbers of the company. If you ask me to take care of that side, I would be sitting there crying because I don't know what to do. If I ask her to design clothes, she wouldn't know how to do (it). But I always tell the young designers that you have to separate the creative side with the business side. You have to have somebody very capable to run the business side. Because then, you're successful. On style ... Style is something so different in everyone. But a style is something that you do that is totally different from the other or something that you're wearing that is the same as the other person but it looks different on you. It's a special touch. Some people have it and some people cannot. On juggling work and family life ... We women manage to do many things at the same time. Men, no. Men do one thing at a time. I see my husband say 'why are you doing all these at the same time? You're going to do something wrong here.' I say, 'No.' Because women, we are able to do that. Because we have children; we have to work sometime; we run a house; we have a husband and everything works. It's a question of organizing yourself. More from Leading Women: Women! Embrace your inner geek . On the Carolina Herrera brand ... I think women in Carolina Herrera ... I like them to be sophisticated and I like them to be classic with a modern twist. You can be dressed by Carolina Herrera New York, but you can have the accessories from CH and it's like a lifestyle. On dressing for your age and figure ... It's about finding the style for the right figure or the right age. Sometimes you see women that don't realize that age is changing your style, and they don't change. What you wore when you were 15 doesn't look that well when you're 30 and certainly looks terrible when you're older. So, you have to change with the times. It's the same thing with a fuller figure or a very thin one. On the white blouse ... The white shirt is one of the easiest things to wear, because you can dress it up or you can wear it with jeans or you can wear it with a ball gown. I mean with a ball skirt. It's so easy. For me it's like a security blanket. When I don't know what to wear, I say a white blouse. You can give your own look to it.

"(CNN) -- ""Two professors, both alike in dignity, in fair Geneva where we lay our scene."" When it is finally written, the story of one of the greatest scientific discoveries of our age may begin something like this. Last month, two eminent professors -- Peter Higgs and Francois Englert -- were jointly awarded one of science's greatest honours: the Nobel Prize in Physics. The award came on the back of the dramatic announcement last year that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), based in Geneva, had made an astonishing discovery: a new particle, a Higgs Boson, had been comprehensively proven to exist. Physicists around the world rejoiced -- some wept openly. Years of speculation, theory and research had suddenly been validated. In typical Scandinavian understatement, Staffan Normark, permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said ""This year's prize is about something small that makes all the difference."" The discovery came as a major puzzle piece in the way physicists understand the universe. The ""Standard Model"" of physics, which some regard as a ""theory of almost everything"" suffered from a significant ""missing link"" before the discovery of the Higgs Boson. Now there seemed to be a reason why particles have mass; now we had a key to understanding our 4% of the universe and perhaps access to understanding the other 96% of the universe as well. But just as one set of answers were being revealed, more questions immediately presented themselves. CNN Labs spoke to some of the world's top physicists about what the discovery of the Higgs Boson means, and what questions now need to be addressed. Joel Butler, a scientist at the prestigious Fermilab laboratory in Illinois said: ""The big question is why the Higgs (particle), with a mass more than 100 times that of the proton, is so light. That question is not answered by our picture of the universe"" Jon Butterworth, Head of Physics and Astronomy at University College London, says that in his view: ""There are issues like what is dark matter? (And) why is the universe mostly matter not antimatter?"" Hitoshi Murayama, a professor of physics at UC Berkeley, says: ""The main question is this: we have never seen an elementary particle without spin. Electron, quarks, photon, etc all have spins ... The Higgs boson may actually have spin but it is spinning in extra dimensions of space we cannot see. We really need to know the true nature and context of this newly discovered particle."" To answer these questions the Large Hadron Collider will soon be joined by another massive experimental facility -- the International Linear Collider (ILC). Like the LHC, the ILC will be a vast machine that stretches for miles beneath the earth. A site for the ILC has yet to be determined. The history of science is replete with machines that have helped scientists make significant breakthroughs, providing the kind of quantifiable, testable, reproducible data science requires to progress. From Marie Curie's ionization chamber used in the discovery of spontaneous radioactivity, to Cathode ray tubes which led to the discovery of the electron, to Geiger counters and more recently the Large Hadron Collider, discoveries have come from equipment both big and small; simple and complex. The ILC sits as the latest in a long line of machines designed to advance physics, but what exactly will it do that the LHC cannot? Tim Meyer, Head of Strategic Planning and Communications at TRIUMF, Canada's national laboratory for particle and nuclear physics, says that it will be able to produce many more Higgs particles than the vast collider in Geneva, and will offer new levels of accuracy. ""The ILC will be able to study the Higgs precisely,"" he said. ""It will be a Higgs factory and will be able to make measurements of the Higgs' properties with 3% relative precision as opposed to the LHC's 25% relative precision, people believe ... The ILC could 'crack open the Higgs' and reveal the mysteries of nature's first spin-zero particle."" Brian Foster, the European Regional Director for the International Linear Collider, says that it is not impossible that the vast machine could help us discover an overarching theory of everything. ""If we are lucky, the ILC can detect a whole new family of particles that might help us to realize Einstein's dream of uniting all the theories of physics into one overarching and conceptually simple theory,"" Foster says. A decision to begin construction on the International Linear Collider is currently expected by 2015.

"(CNN) -- Ryan Kelly Chamberlain II, a San Francisco man accused of having explosive materials at his home, is in custody, an FBI source said Monday. Chamberlain was arrested in Crissy Field, a scenic waterfront area where the Golden Gate Bridge spans the Pacific entrance to San Francisco Bay, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Police have cordoned off the area to search Chamberlain's white Nissan Altima, the official said. Authorities had been looking for him since the weekend. Chamberlain, 42, was last seen Saturday south of San Francisco, the FBI said. ""We don't know the intent or motive yet,"" FBI agent Peter Lee told reporters over the weekend, stressing there was no threat to public safety. The FBI said then that Chamberlain should be considered armed and dangerous. Chamberlain's block was closed for some 15 hours over the weekend as investigators searched and cleared the area, CNN affiliate KTVU reported.","NEW: Chamberlain was arrested in Crissy Field, a law enforcement official says .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- The recent election in Ukraine was a step in the right direction, Russian U.N. Representative Vitaly Churkin told members of the Security Council Wednesday, but unless Ukraine halts military action in the eastern part of the country, Russia cannot engage in dialogue. Ukrainian U.N. Representative Yuriy A. Sergeyev, in turn, accused Russia of ""stoking the flames of separatism"" in the eastern part of his country. The majority of Security Council members commended Ukraine's presidential election, won by billionaire Petro Poroshenko with 55% of the vote. ""Despite successful elections which could be the beginning of a new chapter for Ukraine, violence rages on, causing loss of life and injuries."" said Jeffrey Feltman, the U.N. under-secretary-general for political affairs. More clashes reported in eastern Ukraine . Ukraine's National Guard base in Luhansk was attacked Wednesday by what Ukraine's Interior Ministry described as ""terrorists."" ""There have been losses among military personnel as well as among the attackers,"" said a statement by the ministry. The Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine is at the heart of the separatists' bid to declare independence, which is mirrored in the neighboring Donetsk region. There dozens of pro-Russian separatists were killed after Ukrainian security forces launched an assault on Donetsk International Airport on Monday, following the militants' seizure of a terminal. The Ukrainian military's move against the militants at Donetsk airport has been interpreted by some as an indication that newly elected President Petro Poroshenko will take a tougher stance. The presence of military aircraft may be intended as a reminder of the security forces' capacity to act. Russian troop withdrawal . The Pentagon and NATO are saying Russia has moved at least a few thousand troops back from its border with Ukraine, but a Pentagon spokesman said tens of thousands of combat-ready troops remain. The Kremlin last week announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered tens of thousands of Russian troops to return to their bases but said the pullback could take some time. NATO said Wednesday that there was ""ongoing evidence of equipment and supplies being packed or prepared for movement"" in the area. ""A small number of units have now withdrawn from the border. The activity we are observing continues to suggest a slow withdrawal of forces,"" a NATO military officer said. However, he said, many of the Russian troops remain in the border area and are capable of operations at short notice. ""Thousands of troops have withdrawn, but tens of thousands remain,"" he said. NATO is monitoring the situation and would welcome a complete, verifiable Russian withdrawal, the NATO military officer said. But, he added, ""Any withdrawal does not erase or reverse what has happened in recent months. Russia has violated the trust of the international community by illegally invading Ukraine. The security dynamic in Europe has been fundamentally changed."" Ukraine is not part of NATO, but other former Soviet states such as Poland do belong to the alliance. Russia is opposed to any move by Ukraine to forge closer ties with NATO. Where are the OSCE monitors? Four members of Europe's Special Monitoring Mission who went missing in the eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk are being held by a pro-Russian group, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Yevhen Perebynis said Wednesday. ""The negotiations for their release are in process,"" Perebynis said during a briefing in Kiev. The team members, who are Swiss, Turkish, Estonian and Danish, were on a routine patrol Monday east of Donetsk when last heard from, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. U.N. Undersecretary-General for political affairs Undersecretary Jeffrey Feltman said the OSCE does not know who is holding the four monitors. The last time an OSCE team went missing in Donetsk, its members turned up in the hands of militant separatists in the town of Slovyansk. They were freed just over a week later. There were fears Wednesday that another group of 11 monitors had gone missing after being stopped at a roadblock in Marinka, west of Donetsk, but the group reestablished contact with the OSCE after returning to Donetsk, according to an OSCE statement.

"(CNN) -- Two brothers previously jailed for cannibalism and then released, have been arrested again after police discovered a child's severed head at their home in a remote village in northwest Pakistan. Mohammed Arif Ali was arrested early Monday after neighbors alerted police to a ""foul smell"" coming from his house in the village of Kahawar Khan in the Bhakkar district of Punjab, district police chief Ameer Abdullah Khan told CNN Tuesday. When they went to investigate, they discovered the decapitated head of an infant next to a burning stove. The head, which is now being examined at a hospital in the nearby village of Darya Khan, looked to be around five days old, Abdullah said . Arif Ali was arrested at the scene, while his brother, Mohammed Farman Ali, was apprehended by police hours later on the outskirts of their village. Police said both men confessed to eating human flesh. The brothers were released from prison last year after serving a two-year jail term for similar offenses -- they admitted dismembering a woman's body they had stolen from a graveyard in Darya Khan where they lived at the time. With no explicit law on cannibalism in Pakistan, the two men were convicted of desecrating a dead body and other public order offenses in a case that provoked widespread revulsion across Pakistan, according to CNN affiliate Geo TV.

"Bangkok (CNN) -- The morning after Thailand's military came clean and admitted their operation to restore order was in fact a coup, the capital appeared normal with shops open and commuters heading for work -- though schools were shuttered. Surprisingly, there was not much of a military presence on the streets, with the exception of the heavily-armed troops stationed outside key buildings in the city, including the Defense Ministry and the Army Club. We spotted only four soldiers in their camouflaged fatigues during our journey around Bangkok -- though more were undoubtedly deployed overnight following the imposition of a curfew between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. Every now and then vehicles with darkened windows arrived at the Army Club, where the coup was declared, to deliver those people summoned by the military administration. Anyone who didn't accept this invitation faced an arrest warrant. Military officials haven't provided much explanation about the reasons for the summonses, saying only that it's necessary ""to ensure smooth operation of restoration of peace and order."" There were rumors that TV stations were slowly returning to air after being switched off by the military, though foreign news stations such as CNN and the BBC remain blacked out. Meanwhile, protest sites belonging to both ""red shirt"" supporters of ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and the ""yellow shirt"" protesters associated with Bangkok's urban elite and middle class have emptied -- the detritus from their long struggle all that's left. These cities within a city have stood for months. The yellow shirts' former camp by the Democracy Monument is now a mountain of rubbish and abandoned tents awaiting removal by the army of municipal workers with their trucks and cranes. Many of the refuse workers seemed cheerful as they started the massive cleanup operation, seemingly oblivious to the seismic political shift going on around them. It certainly doesn't feel like a coup as you would imagine it. But after months of protests -- and periodic outbreaks of violence -- many ordinary Thais seem content to let this play out for the time being, with many of the opinion that anything that avoids further chaos and might help to resolve the political conflict is a good thing.","Not much of a military presence on the streets of Thailand's capital .

"(CNN) -- A flood warning remained in effect for northeastern North Carolina on Saturday as heavy rains left some businesses underwater and scores of roads closed. Flooding in North Carolina, New York, Pennsylvania and New England killed at least eight people, officials said. Bertie County in North Carolina was the hardest hit with waters as high as stop signs in some areas. Most roads were closed or partially closed. ""A lot of people cannot get to their homes,"" said County Manager Zee Lamb. Rescue shelters were set up and animals in a small zoo were taken to higher ground. ""The county library is under 5 feet of water in the town of Windsor,"" Lamb said. ""You cannot get to the courthouse by road. I got here by boat today."" Many businesses in the city are underwater, Lamb said, adding that the county has asked for state emergency assistance. Historic homes in the town were also damaged. Townspeople were surprised by the extent of the flooding, according to the county manager. ""[Hurricane] Floyd [in 1999] was supposed to be the 100-year-old flood,"" Lamb said. ""Eleven years later, we have another major flood."" The storm system dropped heavy rain in the Northeast part of the country as the remnants of Tropical Storm Nicole interacted with an upper-level low and a frontal boundary. Flood watches and warnings were in effect from the mid-Atlantic states to Maine. High-wind warnings were in effect from Massachusetts to Maine, with wind gusts up to 60 mph. Boston was already feeling the effects, although the rain was expected to clear by Saturday morning. Philadelphia and much of eastern and central Pennsylvania were deluged by rainfall and a motorist died after driving into floodwaters near Skippack Creek, state troopers said. Troopers saw the vehicle floating near a golf course, but were unable to reach the female driver, who was later found dead. Police said a 72-year-old woman was trapped for more than eight hours inside her car in Cumru Township before she escaped.

"Beijing (CNN) -- In the latest twist of a widening anti-corruption campaign, Chinese authorities have detained a popular and controversial television anchor with the national broadcaster, state media reported. Rui Chenggang's anchor chair was left empty for Friday night's newscast on China Central Television after prosecutors detained the star journalist shortly before airtime. It appeared that Rui, known for his ""big get"" interviews as well as nationalistic sentiment, was taken into custody less than an hour before the start of ""Economic News,"" which his co-anchor presented alone. Speculation about Rui's troubles began last month when his longtime patron Guo Zhenxi, the head of state-run CCTV's financial news channel, was detained for allegedly accepting bribes. Several other senior figures at the channel were also implicated, the government said. 'Face of New China' Rui, 37, denied through an assistant last month that he was under investigation. He tweeted at the time to his 10 million followers on Sina Weibo -- China's equivalent of Twitter -- a philosophical conversation between two ancient Zen masters that implied time would eventually clear his name. State media cited CCTV sources on Saturday as saying that Rui's detention was closely linked to Guo's case, as well as an investigation into his own possible profiting from using CCTV resources. Rui, who's known for wearing designer suits and driving fast cars, commands more social media followers than any other CCTV personality and has been called the ""face of the New China"" by his admirers. His official CCTV bio says he has interviewed hundreds of business and political leaders around the world. The New York Times has profiled him and even the popular American comedy program ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" has featured him in an episode. Fluent in English, Rui began his broadcast career at CCTV's international service, but his stardom soared under Guo after the young journalist jumped to the network's financial news channel in 2008. An unapologetic self-promoter, he has authored two popular autobiographical books touting his friendship with the world's rich and powerful. Controversial figure . Rui became a more divisive public figure as his celebrity grew. He successfully led a controversial campaign to kick Starbucks out of Beijing's Forbidden City in 2007, calling the American coffee shop's presence in the historic palace museum an encroachment on Chinese culture. He grabbed a global spotlight in 2010 when U.S. President Barack Obama said he would give the final question at a news conference in Seoul to South Korean media. ""I'm actually Chinese, but I think I get to represent the entire Asia,"" Rui said before asking a long-winded question on how Obama might prevent his policies from being misinterpreted. At an economic forum in northeastern China the following year, Rui asked Gary Locke, then the U.S. ambassador to China, a question that some critics called a nationalistic publicity stunt. Others applauded it as a sign of an increasingly confident China standing up to the United States. ""My colleagues told me you flew economy class from Beijing to Dalian,"" Rui asked Locke. ""Was that a reminder that the U.S. still owes China money?"" Locke replied that it was standard government policy for American diplomats and other officials to fly coach. 'Tigers and flies' Rui's reported detention came on the heels of the downfall of several former high-ranking officials, including a retired top general of the 2 million-strong People's Liberation Army. Gen. Xu Caihou, a former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission that runs the world's largest standing army, was expelled from the ruling Communist Party and handed over to prosecutors after being found to have accepted bribes, state-run Xinhua news agency reported early this month. Xu was also a member of the Politburo, China's decision-making body, before retiring in 2012. State media have characterized Xu as a big ""military tiger"" caught in the massive anti-graft campaign launched by President Xi Jinping, who is also the commander in chief. Xi banned official extravagance -- from banquets to year-end gifts -- and vowed to target ""tigers and flies"" alike in his fight against corruption. He resolved to spare no one, regardless of position. CCTV recently touted the capture of 35 ""tigers"" since Xi took power less than two years ago. Zhou Yongkang . Some China watchers have noted ties between an increasing number of disgraced officials and Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar who has been rumored to be under investigation for some time. Guo, the CCTV executive who was Rui's patron, has long been considered belonging to the Zhou faction. State media have reported official probes into many of Zhou's family members as well as former associates in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and southwestern Sichuan province -- three places Zhou once ruled. If he is actually charged, Zhou would become the highest-ranking official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the People's Republic. Some 182,000 officials were disciplined in 2013, while courts nationwide tried 23,000 corruption cases, according to the Communist Party's disciplinary commission. State media have cited the trial and conviction last year of former high-flying politician Bo Xilai -- which Bo supporters called politically motivated -- as one prime example of Xi's determination to clean up the party. Top China aides ousted from Communist Party . 'Endemic corruption' Longtime China observers, however, point to the limits of Xi's war on corruption. ""Corruption is so widespread and so endemic that campaigns are just not going to do it,"" said Frank Ching, a Hong Kong-based commentator and columnist on Chinese politics. ""Something has to be done about the system."" ""There have been public calls for a law to require officials disclosing their assets. There has been no indication that they are going to do that. In fact, a number of people calling for this law have ended up in prison,"" Ching said. ""I think people will be much more convinced of the seriousness of this anti-corruption campaign if there were a move to enact such a law.""

The latest polls are clear -- President Barack Obama will carry his home city and state and scoop up its 20 electoral college votes in his battle for re-election by a large majority. Illinois will vote Democrat, as it has for the past five elections. Obviously Chicago is amongst the last places to get an unbiased opinion on this year's presidential race. This is the absolute heart of Obama country. It is the place where Obama lived and taught law. The city where he started his political life, first elected to the state legislature then, in a few short years, honing his policies for national office. Full coverage: CNN's Election Center . Illinois is where he announced his run for the presidency. Four years ago, in Chicago's Grant Park, the new President-elect Obama delivered his victory speech in front of tens of thousands of screaming supporters. So if this mid-western city is so firmly in the Obama camp, why am I here? What can I hope to learn from a place so biased they should just weight his vote rather than count it? It is the perfect place to start my American Quest. See more: American Quest in pictures . Chicago is the third largest city in the U.S. Here, the buildings rival New York's in size and beauty. The hardy mid-western people play on the national stage. Chicago is a confident, muscular city whose people need none of the tinsel show-and-tell of the west, nor the power posturing of the east. Boeing, McDonald's, United Airlines and Kraft foods are some of the global companies headquartered in the metropolitan area. Here, they make things. Early today, as I stood by the Buckingham Fountain, just yards from where Obama addressed his adoring base four years ago, the city was at its resplendent best. Debate analysis: Biden, Ryan slug it out . A crisp breeze blew in from Lake Michigan and a rainbow appeared in the fountain's spray, forming a perfect arc over the magnificent skyline. Chicago was putting on a show of contended bravado. By starting here, we gauge how the faithful view their man, before we delve into those parts of the country where the doubters, naysayers and downright critics live. This American Quest will take us from Chicago to the swing states of Iowa and Colorado. We will sojourn in the strong Romney state of Utah, home of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, whose followers are known as Mormons. And we will end up in California, a state which even though it will almost certainly vote Democrat, we can learn much of the trends for the future. Five States: Two Swing. Two Democrat. One Republican. Austan Goolsbee was head of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers and is now a professor in Chicago's prestigious Booth School of Business at The University of Chicago, where Obama taught law. He told me we will find many different types of economies as we travel by rail to California. Read more: The 25 funniest tweets about the VP debate . Some states, like Illinois, with its wide variety of industries, have rebounded strongly from the recession. At 9.1% unemployment, it is above the national average and amongst the worst in the country. But the state's mainstay, Chicago, has bounced back. A diverse economy across services and manufacturing has helped insulate it from the severest bite of the economic chill. As we travel across America, Goolsbee points out that we will see how the rise in commodity prices has benefited other Great Plain states like Iowa, which should benefit the president in this swing state. Then we will head to Colorado, which Goolsbee calls ""ground zero"" in the White House race because of its mixture of new business and old. This is where the economy is being reborn through new business like health care and technology. Map: Voices from around the world . But more depressingly, out of the window of our train we will see neighborhoods in Nevada built with more optimism than pragmatism, now abandoned to economic fate and foreclosure. More than half the state's homeowners are ""underwater,"" owing more to the banks than their properties are worth. We will end our journey in California. Lively. Maverick. Trendsetting -- and amongst the most diverse states socially and economically. The Golden State's manufacturing and high tech industries will warrant close inspection. This journey is more than just about ""the economy, stupid"" although that is by far the single biggest concern. Expect issues of birth control, same sex marriage, gun laws and more to be on our menu. And throughout we will return to the comfort of our Amtrak train, to muse on our findings as we cross these United States. When I asked him what he thought of our plan to cross all of these states by rail, Goolsbee said he thought we were crazy. Personally, I can't wait to see all this for myself.","CNN's Richard Quest is traveling across the U.S. for American Quest, which will air from October 29 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- London's Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew recently opened an attraction that gives visitors the chance to walk among the treetops and examine tree canopies from a new perspective. The walkway at Kew is designed to give visitors a new perspective on trees. The Xstrata Treetop Walkway, which opened at the end of May, is the latest design from London Eye architects Marks Barfield. Rising to a height of 18 meters and stretching across 200 meters, visitors can walk between 50 of Kew's mature broad-leafed trees. The walkway can be found in the woodland area designed by 18th-century landscape gardener Capability Brown. Constructed from 12 steel trusses connected to 10 circular ""node"" platforms, the weathered steel chosen for the project already blends beautifully with the natural environment. The architects describe the end result as ""a surprisingly natural, 'bark-like' texture."" Tony Kirkham, head of RBG Kew's arboretum and project manager for the Xstrata Treetop Walkway, said, ""As a trained arborist, I have had the privilege of being up in the tree canopy; experiencing trees at height and birds and other wildlife from a completely different perspective. It's fantastic that we are able to give visitors the same experience."" In what has been designated ""Year of the Tree"" at Kew, Kirkham hopes that giving visitors a new perspective on the trees will help them understand the importance of nurturing them.","London's Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew opens treetop walkway .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- The business deal looked fairly straightforward. Last week, American basketball star Kobe Bryant agreed to become the new celebrity face of Turkish Airlines, a growing international carrier. Though he has admitted to never having visited Turkey, the Los Angeles Lakers guard said in a news release that ""Turkey is a country rich in natural beauty and thousands of years of cultural history, and I'm proud to partner with Turkish Airlines to bring that majesty to people around the world."" Within days, however, Bryant's decision was being denounced by Armenian groups in North America and in Los Angeles, which is the hometown not only of the Lakers, but also of the largest ethnic Armenian community outside of Armenia. ""Turkish Deal Will Make Kobe the Face of Oppression and Injustice"" and ""Kobe Bryant's Direct Flight to Inhumanity,"" announced the website of the Armenian Youth Federation. Armenian diaspora groups in North America have launched a media and Internet campaign urging Bryant to drop his Turkish Airlines deal. In Toronto, about 30 Canadian-Armenians protested against Bryant, holding signs that said ""Kobe: Do the Right Thing,"" outside the stadium where the Lakers played the Raptors on Sunday. What appeared to be a standard and presumably lucrative celebrity endorsement has run headlong into a passionate dispute over a bloody chapter in history that took place in the highlands of eastern Turkey nearly a century ago. Armenian groups and many scholars argue that starting in 1915, Turks committed genocide, when more than a million ethnic Armenians were massacred in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. Modern-day Turkey officially denies that a genocide took place, arguing instead that hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians and Muslim Turks died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of World War I. The genocide debate is an annual source of tension between Turkey and the United States, two NATO military allies. Every year, the White House beats back efforts in Congress to pass a resolution which would formally recognize the 1915 massacres of Armenians as genocide. In March, Turkey temporarily withdrew its ambassador to Washington in protest, after the House Foreign Affairs Committee narrowly voted in favor of a nonbinding resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide. The resolution was subsequently blocked from reaching a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives. American officials worry that Turkish anger over the genocide resolution could impact US use of the Incirlik airbase in southern . Turkey, which is a vital logistical hub for troops moving to and from Afghanistan. The Turkish government has expressed concern in recent days, over reports that outgoing House speaker Nancy Pelosi may try to bring an Armenian genocide resolution to vote in the final days of the current lame-duck Congress. Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu phoned his American counterpart Hillary Clinton on Friday, to ""emphasize the seriousness of the situation,"" a Turkish diplomatic spokesman said. ""Even though this is a lame-duck session, what we understood is that this is a serious possibility and we had concerns for different reasons,"" said Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Selcuk Unal, in a phone call with CNN. This month Pelosi came under fresh pressure to schedule a vote from an unlikely lobbyist -- reality TV star Kim Kardashian. The Armenian-American celebrity urged her 5.6 million Twitter followers to call Pelosi to urge her to schedule an Armenian Genocide Resolution vote. As part of his two-year contract to be Turkish Airlines' new ""Global Brand Ambassador,"" Bryant is expected to make television and print commercials, as well as a number of public appearances for the company.","Armenian diaspora in N.

"Brasilia, Brazil (CNN) -- With just a little more than a week until the first kickoff of the 2014 World Cup, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff hosted a dinner for international journalists and countered criticism that too much money was spent on stadiums while infrastructure projects languished. Rousseff told her guests that many of the country's ambitious infrastructure plans were never intended to be finished for the World Cup, but the mega sporting event was simply used as an excuse to get projects off the ground. ""Nobody builds a metro in two years,"" she said on the a terrace of the presidential residence, Palacio da Alvorada, designed by renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. Of the 143 billion reais ($63 billion) earmarked for infrastructure projects, only 8 to 9 billion reais were meant to be used specifically during the Cup. ""The rest isn't for the Cup, it's for Brazil,"" she said. With the June 12 kickoff just around the corner, Brazil has seen a series of protests and strikes against World Cup projects, as well as criticism over construction delays and cost overruns. Drug gangs rule favelas away from World Cup crackdown . But Rousseff said Brazilians would start to go football crazy as soon as the national team steps on the pitch in the inaugural match against Croatia. She pointed to a 49% jump in the sales of televisions as a sign that Brazilians were anxiously awaiting the event. ""That's how we watch the games. Not in the stadium. We get everyone together in front of the biggest TV,"" she said. ""If Brazil wins, we go to the street."" The President fielded questions and told stories over a buffet dinner that featured Brazilian beef, French wine, a traditional seafood stew known as muqueca and tapioca ice cream -- although she skipped dessert herself. When asked whether she thought it was a mistake to host World Cup matches in 12 different cities instead of the minimum eight cities required by FIFA, Rousseff said the international football association chose the cities and added that now was not the time to ask what could have been done differently. FIFA has always said Brazil insisted on the 12 cities to ensure the whole country was involved in the World Cup. It's a delicate moment for Rousseff, who will run for a second term in October's presidential elections. For many Brazilians, the success of the World Cup and even of the Brazilian team are tied up with her electoral prospects. Rousseff is the favorite, but her margin has steadily declined, making it highly likely that there will be a runoff vote. A survey released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center found 72% of Brazilians were ""dissatisfied with the way things are going in their country"" and 61% said they thought hosting the World Cup ""was a bad thing"" because it took money away from schools, health care and other public services. At the Tuesday night dinner, Rousseff said she didn't think the World Cup should be politicized and even went on to talk about her time as a political prisoner during the Brazilian dictatorship, something she rarely discusses. ""I spent the 1970 World Cup in jail. I think something like a World Cup is independent from politics,"" she said. A victory for the Brazil squad would be a success for the country, not for her presidency or her party, she said. Rousseff also reiterated her view that the recent demonstrations were a sign of a functioning democracy and said they would be allowed as long as there wasn't any vandalism, violence or attempts to disrupt the games. Over the leisurely dinner that lasted for more than three hours, the President also talked about some of her favorite TV series -- ""Downton Abbey"" and the first two seasons of ""House of Cards"" -- and authors, such as Jane Austen and Leonardo Padura. The President appeared relaxed and smiling throughout the evening, even telling the table of journalists about the time she ""escaped"" on the back of a red Harley-Davidson with a friend and drove around Brasilia unbeknownst to her security detail. Rousseff said she has high hopes for Brazil in the Cup and plans to attend the opening and closing ceremonies, but will watch the other games on TV. And if Brazil's football archenemy Argentina were to win? ""You would hear the biggest silence in the country,"" she said. ""But I don't think it will happen."" INTERACTIVE: Brazil by the numbers .

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- Stuart Miles, founder of Pocket-lint.com, has been scouring the world's biggest mobile technology show in Barcelona for the latest gadgets and innovations. Here are the gadgets that caught his eye: . A cinema experience on your phone: Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 7.1 surround demo, by DTS . There was a time when a mobile phone speaker was a joke. But things are changing, and phones and tablets due out in the second half of 2013 will pack a number of features designed to give them enough power to become your home entertainment hub. The new Qualcomm Snapdragon processor comes with the ability to replicate a 7.1 surround sound speaker system -- even through a pair of standard headphones. Dubbed Headphone:X, the technology is very clever, especially when you add in the processor's ability to play 4k video. Better photography: Nvidia Tegra 4i HDR camera demo . Nvidia is Qualcomm's biggest challenger in the mobile processor space. Aside from games - the company is due to launch its own Tegra 4-powered Android console called Project Shield later this year -- it has been showing off real-time High Dynamic Range photography capabilities that automatically adjust a picture for light and dark areas on the fly. It's something that today's cameras struggle to do, and certainly something where you need lots of power under the hood. A superior tablet: Sony Xperia Tablet Z . There are many tablets on show at Mobile World Congress this year, including ones that are also trying to be a phone. The Sony Xperia Tablet Z caught my eye for a number of reasons. Firstly it's a real change in product design from Sony -- in a good way -- but secondly the tablet, like the company's new Xperia Z phone, is waterproof, making it ideal for the bath, or those that find themselves working out and about in tough conditions. Tell us: What's your dream smartphone feature? Safer shopping with a Paddle . Paddle is a shopping system that tries to make shopping online easier and safer. The idea is that e-commerce sites add a ""buy with Paddle"" button at the checkout, simplifying the payment process. It does this by generating a QR code for you to read with a dedicated app on your phone. Once you scan the code, all the merchant details are ready for you to check, and because the app has all your payment details, all that's left is for you to press ""buy."" The fact that you have to scan a QR code on the screen also means there is an extra level of security. It's currently being internally tested by Marks & Spencer in the UK. Streaming music in cars: Ford Spotify AppLink . Ford has teamed up with Spotify to bring the music-streaming service to its Ford Sync AppLink cars in Europe, starting with the EcoSport later in the year. Ford SYNC AppLink allows drivers to control smartphone apps from the driver's seat, using voice control. Understanding voice in the car is going to be one of the key battlegrounds for cars in the near future. Ford says it has spent a lot of time making sure the EcoSport has a good microphone and the capacity to actually hear the instructions you give, meaning you can keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel. Read more: How your phone will know when you're sick . A mobile phone that is ... a phone: Nokia 105 . While the flagship handsets get more and more powerful, Nokia isn't forgetting those that don't need a 5-inch display, a powerful processor, or the ability to download a play a host of games. It has launched a phone that costs just â‚¬15 (about $20) and has 35 days of stand-by from a single charge. What's clever is that it's a phone that is actually just a phone. Sometimes keeping things simple really works. Free apps on your phone: Firefox OS . When the original iPhone launched, it didn't have apps, it had web apps -- free programs that bring the best of the web to your phone. Apple soon realised that a better and more lucrative way of doing things was to create paid-for apps, and the rest is history. Jump forward five years and Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox browser is trying to bring back free web based apps with a mobile operating system completely built on HTML 5. The beauty here is that the OS will be free, and the handsets needn't be powerful. With lots of backing from major players, it's already punching above its weight. Certainly one to watch.","Among new gadgets showcased in Barcelona is a processor that can deliver surround sound from a mobile phone .

"(CNN) -- Americans in two dozen states from the Midwest to the Southeast and Northeast are shivering this week courtesy of a distorted polar vortex. The rush of cold air it's sending southward is the biggest visitor from the North Pole since Santa Claus. The gifts it brings, however, are chilling and generally unwelcome. Much of the United States has plunged into a deep freeze from record low temperatures. CNN International senior meteorologist Brandon Miller answers a few pressing questions about this phenomenon. What is a polar vortex? What distinguishes it? The polar vortex, as it sounds, is circulation of strong, upper-level winds that normally surround the northern pole in a counterclockwise direction -- a polar low-pressure system.  These winds tend to keep the bitter cold air locked in the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is not a single storm. On occasion, this vortex can become distorted and dip much farther south than you would normally find it, allowing cold air to spill southward. How frequently does this polar vortex distortion occur? The upper-level winds that make up the polar vortex change in intensity from time to time. When those winds decrease significantly, it can allow the vortex to become distorted, and the result is a jet stream that plunges deep into southern latitudes, bringing the cold, dense Arctic air spilling down with it. This oscillation is known as the Arctic Oscillation and it can switch from a positive phase to negative phase a few times per year. This oscillation -- namely the negative phase where the polar winds are weaker -- tends to lead to major cold air outbreaks in one or more regions of the planet. Where on Earth can this happen? The polar vortex can lead to major cold air outbreaks in any portion of the Northern Hemisphere -- North America, Europe and Asia. This will lead to cold snaps in multiple locations, though not always. How dangerous is a polar vortex distortion as compared to a tornado or hurricane? Completely different type of systems. A cold air outbreak caused by the polar vortex is much more widespread and lasts longer than a single storm. With the widespread drop in temperature, however, you can see significant winter storms develop, especially when the cold air is initially advancing into a previously warm region -- much like the nor'easter this past week. When was the last big one to hit a densely populated area? Serious cold snaps happen several times a year, though in different regions of the world and with different severities. Last March saw a significant decrease in temperature as a result of the polar vortex pushing into much of Europe. Many locations experienced an Easter holiday that was much colder than their Christmas holiday. The United Kingdom, for instance, had its coldest March in 50 years. If you get caught up in one, what should you do? Again, it's not a ""storm"" that you get caught in. But when faced with significant cold temperatures, you should stay inside whenever possible, layer clothing if you must be outside, winterize your home and car, etc. Is it a side effect of global warming and should we expect more events like this? This is a hotly researched topic. In short, yes, it could be. It seems counterintuitive that global warming could cause significant cold snaps like this one, but some research shows that it could. We know that different types of extreme weather can result from the overall warming of the planet, melting of the Arctic Sea ice, etc. This includes extreme distortions of the jet stream, which can cause heat waves in summer and cold snaps in winter. Parts of Western Europe have been battered by the worst storms for two decades during the past week -- are they related to the weather system in the United States? They are related in a sense, but I wouldn't say ""caused by."" The storms in Europe are the result of a persistent pattern that has seen the jet stream parked near the United Kingdom and Ireland, which has brought a train of storm systems over the British Isles. This is the same jet stream, of course, that has plunged deep into the southern portions of the United States.  So, the jet stream has been ""stuck"" in a position that is allowing cold Arctic air to spill into much of the United States and Canada. But it is in a position that is bringing warmer, moist air from the Atlantic over Northwest Europe, resulting in the stormy conditions.","Polar vortex is circulation of strong, upper-level winds that normally surround the North Pole .

"(CNN) -- Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its latest ""Middle East and North Africa Economic Outlook"" report. The document aims to provide a detailed overview of the main political, economic and social trends facing the region. Alongside an economic analysis of the cost of the Syrian conflict, the report found that many countries are still struggling to stabilize three years after the Arab Spring. However growth in other countries may be helping the region turn a corner. CNN's John Defterios sat down with the IMF's Middle East and Central Asia Director, Masood Ahmed, to probe the report's findings further and ask how we can expect the countries featured to develop in the near to medium term. He started by asking about the reports findings on growth in the region. Masood Ahmed (MA): (Right now), many oil importing countries in the Middle East and North Africa are growing at between 2.5% and 3.5%. Many of these countries were (previously) growing at 6% and 7%. Egypt (and) Tunisia, if you go back to 2008 and 2009 were growing at those rates. How do we get back to those rates and how do we generate more jobs? First of all, create a degree of more certainty for the private sector. The private sector right now is still holding back because of the transitions. That will work its way through in the next year or so. Second, start embarking on some of the reforms that will improve the prospects for small and medium sized enterprises t come in. John Defterios (JD): People think, 'Oh 2 to 3% (a decent rate of growth for developed countries) and that's with instability'. What do you need to get these economies on a more stable track? MA: The kind of growth you need to get these economies on a stable path is kind of in the neighborhood of 5% and 6% rather than 2% or 3%. Why? Because that's the level of growth that will create the jobs that an accruing number of young people that are coming into the labor market need. JD: You mentioned youth unemployment, in most of these countries it's 25% or even more in Arab Spring transition countries. MA: Youth unemployment has been chronically high in our region. But over the past three years because growth rates have slowed down, the number of young people without jobs has actually increased by 1.5 to 2 million people. That in itself means those young people are impatient for a job. But their presence serves sometimes as a deterrent for undertaking the reforms that will generate jobs for them. It's easier to write checks, increase transfers or try to hire them on the public payroll but it's not sustainable. JD: The Syrian spillover effect, most people don't think of this in an economic context but you have. MA: Syria at the moment is obviously a tragedy for the Syrian people but more than that if you look at its neighbors, Lebanon, Jordan and then to a lesser extent Iraq and Turkey, they're all hosting Syrian refugees. In the case of Lebanon and Jordan, this is probably one percentage point or more of GDP in terms of impact already. Beyond that, there's regional trade that's been affected, there's tourism that's been affected and then there's the spread of uncertainty and conflict, sectarian tensions also spilling over across the borders. JD: In your report you underline the inflationary threat. Good news that Dubai landed the 2020 Expo, Qatar has the 2022 World Cup but it could push up prices. MA: You do see some signs of overheating in the short term in Qatar, you do see increases in property prices, particularly real estate in Dubai, and these are things to watch out for. (But) overall, inflation rates in the GCC (Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf), including in these two countries, remain quite manageable. These are, as you've quite rightly pointed out, areas where you need to keep a vigilant eye.","IMF releases latest Middle East and North Africa Economic Outlook report .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Millions of Indonesians cast their ballot for their next president in a neck-and-neck race between Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo, a former furniture businessman who has drawn comparisons to U.S. President Barack Obama, and Prabowo Subianto, a well-connected former military man. Official results may take two to three weeks. Unofficial quick counts showed a slight edge for Widodo. One survey group, Lingkaran Survei Indonesia, showed 53.3% for Widodo and 46.7% for Prabowo with 99% of its data, and another group, Center for Strategic International Studies reported 52% for Widodo over 48% for Prabowo, with 95% of its data. Another independent survey group, Saiful Mujani Research and Consulting indicated 52-53% for Jokowi over Prabowo's 46% with 99% of data. Quick counts in Indonesia are usually accurate with a slim 1-2% margin of error, said Kevin Evans, a political analyst. Unlike previous Indonesian elections though, this race is a tight one. ""Officially it will take us a few weeks to know if we are the actual winner so it must be official,"" Prabowo told CNN. ""I am very confident, very confident,"" he said after voting. ""You saw how enthusiastic the people are, how happy they are. Of course, this is my home village but most of the reports I get from all over Indonesia, we are doing very well."" Over 185 million eligible voters across 17,000 Indonesian islands were eligible to vote. The campaign . Both candidates have been dogged by allegations leading up to voting day for the world's most populous Muslim nation. Earlier this year, Widodo had enjoyed double-digit lead in polls only to watch that advantage erode following smear campaigns suggesting that he is of Chinese descent, or even a Christian -- a deal breaker for many in this Muslim-majority nation. Prabowo, a career military man, had not been able shake off persistent questions about his human rights record. The current president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, will end his 10-year tenure, as Indonesian law prohibits a third term. Yudhoyono leaves office with sagging popularity as growing violence against religious minorities and high-profile scandals tarnished his presidential legacy. Voters are looking for firm leadership that they haven't received under the current president, said Douglas Ramage, an analyst from Bower's Asia Group. The next president will be inaugurated on October 20. The economy question . Yudhoyono leaves behind a slowing economy hampered by trade and budget deficits. The first and foremost issue -- like all elections -- is the economy. Indonesia's economy has slowed to 5-6% growth, which the World Bank says is not enough to provide jobs for the 15 million Indonesians joining the work force. The two candidates have touted the usual talking points, pledging economic growth, more jobs and better infrastructure. ""It has the people, it has the resources, it has favorable demographics, it has rapid urbanization and it has a rising middle class,"" said Ndiame Diop, the World Bank lead economist for Indonesia. ""And it has very good macro-economic management. I think those are ingredients that really lift the country."" But there are concerns over whether the next leader will cut roughly $30 billion in annual energy subsidies. Analysts also worry over a rise of protectionism within the country. ""Both candidates believe Indonesia deserves a bigger share of their national wealth,"" Ramage said. ""Both candidates are presenting a more inward-looking vision of Indonesia."" ""Prabowo might be giving voters what they want to hear: a version of a muscular and assertive Indonesia whose wealth has flowed out of Indonesia and been seized by foreign countries. That message may be resonating with voters."" Questions over Prabowo . Prabowo, a former son-in-law of Indonesian president Suharto, has sought to project an image of a take-charge leader. Having never served in public office, the former lieutenant general has campaigned hard on his military service. And that has appealed to the nation which has had a history of military leaders. ""I think Prabowo has the character of a firm leader and at this point what Indonesia needs is a leader who is very strong,"" said Budi Satria, an Indonesian voter. ""When I say firm, it doesn't mean someone who just speaks loudly, but someone who is decisive."" Prabowo's military record has made him subject of scrutiny for his alleged involvements in controversial campaigns in East Timor, West Papua and a crackdown on pro-democracy activists in 1998. He was removed from his military post that year. In 2000, Prabowo was denied a visa to the United States, believed to stem from his human rights record. He has defended his record, describing himself as ""the staunchest human rights defender in this country."" It hasn't swayed Andreas Harsono, human rights researcher based in Jakarta. ""Of course he makes statements about human rights, but it is murky,"" said Harsono of Human Rights Watch. ""Someone who is accused of making human rights abuses and fired from his job as a general, now talking about human rights, is problematic."" One Indonesian poll indicated about a third of voters know about the human rights questions pertaining to Prabowo. ""I do think that human rights and the question over Prabowo's record has made impact on voters, particularly on swing voters' or undecided voters' political behavior,"" said Usman Hamid, a former student activist in 1998 and masters candidate at Australian National University. Economic class schisms . Earlier this year, Widodo appeared to be a virtual lock for the presidency as he enjoyed double-digit leads in various polls. As a political newcomer to the national stage, he climbed the ranks as mayor of Surakarta to become Jakarta governor. Projecting an image as a reformer, he became known for his spontaneous visits to slums, which drew media attention, and unannounced drop-ins at government offices to catch under-performing workers. ""We want to see this election proceed in a clean, honest way so that it can produce a clean and honest leader who is willing to serve the people,"" he told CNN. As the campaign wore into the summer, Widodo's polling numbers took a hit. ""The Prabowo camp has been effective at negatively defining Jokowi as weak on policy substance and basically not ready for the national stage,"" Ramage said. ""In campaigns, you have to define your opponent first, and Prabowo did that very effectively."" The bulk of his support came from the poorer Indonesians. ""I choose Jokowi because I can see that he cares for the poor and marginalized,"" said Wulan, an Indonesian voter in Jakarta. Meanwhile, the bulk of Indonesia's upper class tends to back Prabowo, according to polling data. But the race may boil down to swing voters. ""The 15% swing voters will be crucial, said Hamdi Muluk, a University of Indonesia professor who specializes in political psychology. ""These voters, they come from the middle class, they're very skeptical and more knowledgeable... it's the key to win the election."" CNN's Kathy Quiano reported from Jakarta and Madison Park repoted and wrote from Hong Kong. Intern Casey Tolan contributed to this article.","Unofficial quick counts show slight edge for ""Jokowi"" Widodo over Prabowo Subianto .

"(EW.com ) -- One thing that makes television so great (and different from film) is the luxury of multiple years and seasons to explore different moments and experiences in a character's life as they naturally progress. Because of that, TV shows frequently evolve drastically from their tidy season 1 concepts, which can make their original titles a bit confusing. With some minor spoilers ahead, here are six TV shows that might have benefited from a name change during their runs: . Veep . When the HBO comedy premiered back in 2012, ""Veep"" was the perfect fit for Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Vice President Selina Meyer dealing with a life in politics and the politics of life. The show is fictional, but ""Veep"" still follows the general rules of American government, so it was natural to assume that Selina would seek her boss' job at some point, and season 3â€²s plot on the campaign trail foreshadowed such a change. Then came the two-part finale, when Selina was actually appointed president as the current commander in chief resigned to take care of his sick wife. Like another TV VP, ""House of Cards'"" Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), Selina becomes president without a single vote cast for her (which looked like the only way she was gonna become president anyway after losing primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire). But now that she's not the ""Veep,"" should the show still have the same name? Alternative title: Peep . Glee . ""Open delight or pleasure; exultant joy; exultation"" â€” that's how the dictionary defines ""glee,"" but the Ryan Murphy musical series was more referring to the high school glee club joined by a bunch of reject teens in Ohio in season 1. Now that Lea Michele is a household name, so is the idea of actually joining a school singing group. For the record, I was the veep (callback!) of my high school's glee club before the show was on the air and before anyone really knew what a glee club was; most schools just refer to them as choirs. And although the New Directions were really a show choir and not a glee club, the idea that singing gives you open delight or pleasure still resonated in the title. But halfway through the fifth season, the show moved completely out of Ohio to New York City to further follow the young characters once they got outside the choir room. Oh, and after years of threats and attempts, Sue Sylvester disbanded the glee club before they left the Midwest for good. I'm sure that playing Fanny Brice on Broadway and having a TV show written about your too-good-to-be-true life ('cause it is a TV show) would bring me exultant joy, but Rachel Berry ain't in the glee club anymore. Well, actually, no one is. And if the show wants to show what it really means to be a struggling young actor without a college education in the Big Apple, it needs to get a little dark. Alternative title: Gloom . Cougar Town . Though better than ""The Courteney Cox Show That Didn't Suck,"" the title of the ABC (and later TBS) sitcom was a little misleading. The show takes place in a fictional Florida town nicknamed ""Cougar Town"" because of the high school mascot, but the show isn't about the whole town; it's about Cox's character Jules, single mother exploring the truths about dating and aging after just getting a divorce. The title was justified in the first season with a relationship with a younger man played by Nick Zano, but by season 3, Jules was engaged and then married to a man her own age. By that point, the concept of the show was quite different than the pilot, and the creators actually did try and change the name multiple times. Options like Sunshine State, Grown Ups, Wine Time, The Sunshine State, and Family Jules all sounded too much like other properties, and a Twitter contest was even launched before season 3 for fan submissions. At least the producers had a sense of humor, though, with the subtitle ""Not Happy About It"" running in promos and the opening sequence, referring to their frustration with the lack of action on the network's part. The show will return for a sixth and final season sometime in 2015 on TBS, and it's still called Cougar Town. Alternative title: The One About the Show With a Bad Title . Beverly Hills, 90210 . After the show premiered in 1990, what quickly became the most popular ZIP code in America was actually one of five ZIP codes that makes up Beverly Hills, California, and the creators of the show were quick to defend the numerical sequence that was making them much larger numerical sequences at the bank. The show takes place in the fictitious West Beverly Hills High School, not because the real Beverly Hills High wouldn't allow it, but because the school is actually located in 90212. Later on in the series when the group attends (the, again, fictitious) California University, the exact location is left up to the imagination of the viewer, but most would assume it also fit the same code. Not exactly. California University was really filmed on the campus of Occidental College in Eagle Rock, California, a.k.a. 90041. And who could forget the beach apartment that Donna and Kelly shared in later seasons? For those unfamiliar with California geography, Beverly Hills is not near the beach at all. That all took place in Hermosa Beach, 90254. Alternative title: Beverly Hills, Etc. Family Matters . Ask anyone on the street if they know ""Family Matters,"" and you might get mixed responses. Ask anyone on the street if they know who Steve Urkel is, and whoa, mama, you'll probably get a more positive reaction. ""Family Matters"" began as a family sitcom centered on matriarch Harriette Winslow, with Jo Marie Payton reprising her role from ""Perfect Strangers"" for the spin-off. However, halfway through the first season, the family's neighbor Steve Urkel was introduced as a love interest for daughter Laura and not only took over the show, but pretty much all of pop culture at the moment. The show ran for nine seasons and more than 200 episodes, eventually introducing Steve's suave alter-ego Stefan Urquelle and his female cousin Myrtle Urkel, also played by Jaleel White. Alternative title: Only Urkel Matters . Two and a Half Men . The CBS sitcom has seen its fair share of ups and downs over the years. At one point, it was nominated for multiple Emmys while bringing in millions of viewers each week, but it will probably end up being more remembered for the controversial cast shakeups. As the title suggests, the show was about two men (Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer) and the young son (half man) of Cryer's character, played by Angus T. Jones. After eight seasons, Charlie Sheen went all #winning on everyone and left the show, having his character killed in the premiere of the ninth season, and was later replaced by Ashton Kutcher (still a man). After Sheen left, Jones went all religious on everyone in 2012 and called the show ""filth that contradicts my moral values."" After some contract negotiations and a brief recurring status, Jones officially left the show at the end of season 10 and was replaced by Amber Tamblyn (not a full or half man) as the long-lost lesbian daughter of Sheen's character. Since the show has lost one and a half of those two and a half men, it would seem an update would make sense. Alternative title: Two and a Half Casting Changes . See the original story at EW.com.

Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In 1998, Kevin Warwick became what some people call ""the world's first cyborg."" To be exact, Warwick, a professor of cybernetics at Reading University, had a radio frequency ID chip implanted in his arm. Years before RFID chips became common, this small implant allowed him to turn on lights by snapping his fingers, or open doors without touching them. Once, after connecting his nerves to an array of electrodes in 2002, he let his wife use her brain waves to take control of his body. It was the first time the nervous systems of two humans had communicated electronically. ""It was quite an intimate feeling,"" he says. This isn't just for fun, Warwick tells Motherboard.tv, VBS' technology channel. He is certain that without upgrading, we humans will someday fall behind the advances of the robots we're building -- or worse. ""Someday we'll switch on that machine, and we won't be able to switch it off,"" he says, sounding a note of alarm that clashes with the cheery visions of futurists like Ray Kurzweil. That might explain why he has very little technology at home, and counts ""The Terminator"" among his biggest influences. Warwick doesn't want to turn into a robot: He wants to be a better human. Augmenting human ability, not turning into an automaton, is, after all, the premise of the ""cyborg."" One of the term's earliest uses, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was in a 1960 New York Times article: ""A cyborg is essentially a man-machine system in which the control mechanisms of the human portion are modified externally by drugs or regulatory devices so that the being can live in an environment different from the normal one."" See the rest of ""The Cyborg"" at VBS.TV . Today, the argument for cybernetics may seem more imperative than ever. Already the latest bionic technologies are allowing deaf children to hear and disabled war veterans to run again. Technologists, meanwhile, see ""augmented reality"" applications for smartphones as doing something similar for our brains, fortifying them for life in a world overflowing with data. For now, Warwick, who will be awarded the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine in 2011, is using his research into brain interfaces and autonomous robots to provide better insight into how memories are formed, and learn how to better treat brain diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. ""Technology, directly integrated with the brain, can help overcome some problems people have,"" says Warwick. Brain implants could keep people fit, making sure, for instance, ""you don't eat that chocolate cake that you want."" But the possibilities may also be stranger than we have yet imagined. Someday, says Warwick, humans could become ""a curiosity for the machines."" "" 'Look at that -- that's where we were in historical times,' they will think to each other.""","Kevin Warwick had radio frequency ID chip implanted in his arm in 1998 .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Civilians, including women and children, have been killed in an attack on a caravan of refugees in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region, the Ukrainian military said Monday. The civilians were trying to escape fighting between pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian military but were not in an established humanitarian safety corridor when they came under fire, a military representative said. The civilians were being escorted by the Ukrainian military from the towns of Khryaschuvate and Novosvitlivka when they were attacked at 9:40 a.m. local time (2:40 a.m. ET), the Kiev-recognized Luhansk Regional Government said. A government representative confirmed that there had been ""heavy gunfire"" in the area and that the victims had been unable to call for help as mobile phone towers were down. Ukrainian Col. Andriy Lysenko told CNN that ""terrorists"" had attacked the caravan with guns from Russia. Lysenko later told media that preliminary information indicated that the attack had been an ambush. The caravan was almost destroyed, and tens of people were killed, he said. Lysenko said that people had been registering to leave with the caravan for several days before the attack. Ukraine's state information agency reported that Grad launchers and mortars had been fired at those trying to leave the war zone. There had been 25 battles in the past 24 hours, with government forces regaining part of the city of Luhansk, Lysenko said. ""Luhansk is almost fully encircled, and the operation to free it is going on right now,"" he said. The rebels had used Uragan rocket launchers for the first time, Lysenko said. Ukraine on Sunday reported gains against the rebels, saying the army had entered Donetsk and raised the Ukrainian flag in front of the district's police offices. Ukrainian forces also regained control of the strategic town of Yasynuvata in Donetsk in the southeastern part of the country, according to the official Twitter account of President Petro Poroshenko. On Monday, Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported that the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic had announced the death penalty would be introduced ""for the gravest crimes."" Once the war ended, the group would step ""on the path of humanization of the criminal law,"" RIA Novosti quoted a DPR minister as saying, after a meeting of its council Sunday. Humanitarian agencies say thousands of people in the region don't have access to water, electricity and proper medical aid. Ongoing fighting downed power lines and stopped Donetsk city's water treatment plant from working Sunday, the City Council said. The Donetsk City Council announced on its website that the water supply would be cut off starting at 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET). In a new statement Monday, it said the supply remained disrupted, with fighting hindering repairs. Ukrainian officials acknowledged Sunday that a convoy of more than 260 Russian vehicles on the border is, in fact, carrying humanitarian aid, a statement on the Ukrainian Cabinet website said. Ukraine received an inventory of the supplies Saturday, which was signed by the head of the regional International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegation to Russia. But Col. Lysenko said Monday that failure to reach an agreement on safety with the ICRC had prevented a detailed inspection. The convoy initially sparked fears that Russia was trying to use a humanitarian convoy as a cover for sending in more aid and weapons for pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine, which Russia and the rebels denied. The ongoing fighting -- sparked last year by a political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia -- has left more than 2,000 people dead and just under 5,000 wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April, according to estimates from U.N. officials. What's happening in Ukraine? Progress reported in cease-fire talks . The foreign ministers of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France met in Berlin on Sunday to discuss the crisis in Ukraine. ""We discussed the question of how we can find ways to reach an urgently needed cease-fire in eastern Ukraine,"" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said. ""We discussed the question of how we can improve and optimize controls at the Russian-Ukrainian border."" Steinmeir said progress had been made in certain areas and the parties were looking at further talks. Russia's Foreign Ministry released a statement saying the talks focused on ""the earliest possible termination of the hostilities, border control, humanitarian aid delivery to southeastern Ukraine, and creating the conditions for the earliest beginning of the process of political settlement."" ""Some progress was made on all these issues,"" it said. The United States and the European Union have applied steadily increasing sanctions against Russian officials, banks and other interests since March, when Russia annexed the Black Sea Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Russia's move came a month after Ukraine's parliament ousted pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych left office after violent protests against his government in the capital, Kiev. Those protests were motivated in part by his decision to back out of a trade deal with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia. Aid or invasion?

"(CNN) -- Few items inspire universal teenage angst quite like the school report card, that mishmash of letters and numbers that could periodically mean the difference between family praise and punishment. Sometimes, however, it can also inspire new business opportunities. A few years back, Boniface Githinji was studying computer science at the University of Nairobi. Shortly after his return home for the holidays, he ran into one of his neighbors who started complaining about his child doing what so many other kids around the world with bad grades resort to: hiding their report cards from their parents. This got the young Kenyan programmer thinking: ""I thought, we can actually come up with a solution to that problem,"" says Githinji. ""Virtually every parent owns a cell phone in this country -- and that doesn't have to be a smart phone to receive SMSs,"" he adds. ""And so since I was doing computer science training on how to program and make software, we came up with a simple service to make it easy for these schools to send report cards by SMS."" That service has today become Sematime, a Nairobi-based SMS service provider. With just a click of a few buttons, schools can send report cards to parents on their mobile phones, allowing them to keep better track of their children's education. In addition, schools can also use the platform to distribute exam results, fee balances and general communication messages. Githinji, 26, says the service is designed to make parents become more involved. ""If you are not up on how your kid is performing in school, then that kid to some extent probably feels not loved,"" he says. ""And then as a parent I want to know how my kid is performing so I can take some measures. I can go speak to the teacher and get to know why is he not performing well."" So far, more than 1,500 schools use Sematime, forming a huge percentage of the startup's clientele base. The rest is composed of small and medium businesses in Nairobi, which use the service to send information, bills and invoices to large groups through text messages. Githinji, who started the company in 2011, says the biggest problems initially were raising capital and convincing schools about the service. But he found a crucial ally in Nailab, a Nairobi-based startup accelerator that helps budding entrepreneurs develop their tech ideas. ""I probably wouldn't be here if it weren't for Nailab,"" he says. ""It's an organization that tends to start ups, people who want to do something but they don't have the facilities, they don't have the internet."" Githinji has had a pretty successful start. His company made about six million Kenyan shillings last year -- that's about $68,000. But even with his financial success so far, he remains grounded. ""In terms of feeling accomplished, I think it is a long, long way to that point,"" says Githingi. ""It has not been as easy, the only thing that has been keeping us going on is a passion,"" he adds. ""You have to have a passion for what you do because you have challenges; sometimes you run out of money, sometimes customers run away from you. ""I think it is just beginning -- we have a thousand things we want to do and we can't wait to get started."" READ THIS: The African company that trumped Apple .

"(CNN) -- U.N. peacekeepers and troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo are trying to bring peace to an eastern Congo town where a cattle-rustling dispute led to the deaths of 30 people. At least 15 people were wounded in Friday's unrest, part of ongoing violence in this area of the country, the United Nations said. The United Nations called for an immediate end to fighting between the Bafuliru and Barundi/Banyamulenge communities in the province of South Kivu. Martin Kobler, the chief of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, said troops would be deployed to Mutarule to assist the Congolese army and local officials. Eastern Congo, a mineral-rich region, has been at the center of a political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda, for two decades. Government troops have also battled rebel groups such as M23, which was defeated in November. The persistent violence has led to thousands of families who cannot farm and leave their homes for refugee camps, according to the United Nations. The international body also blames a lack of government spending on agriculture, education, health and infrastructure for the worsening situation.","The United Nations sends in peacekeepers after 30 people are killed .

"(CNN) -- Kevin Smith used to think he led a comfortable middle-class existence that included a car and a home in a subdivision in Raleigh, North Carolina. But then he lost his job and felt himself slipping into the have-not corner. He, like a majority of Americans who responded to a new survey issued Wednesday, believes the gap between America's rich and poor is getting wider. He isn't resentful of people who sleep in mansions and drive swank cars, but he is angry at a system that he says allows the greedy to take advantage of people. ""I am not angry at rich people,"" said Smith, 51. ""I am angry at the people who manipulate the system."" America's top 1% of the population saw their incomes skyrocket by 275% between 1979 and 2007, according to the Congressional Budget Office, creating a disparity that is foremost in people's minds. Conflict between rich and poor is at an all-time high, at least in the way of public perception, a new Pew Research Center poll shows. The survey found that 66% of adults believe there are ""very strong"" or ""strong"" conflicts between the two groups. That number spiked 19 percentage points since Pew last posed that question in 2009. ""As a result, in the public's evaluations of divisions within American society, conflicts between rich and poor now rank ahead of three other potential sources of group tension -- between immigrants and the native born; between blacks and whites; and between young and old,"" the survey said. Author Richard Morin said he was surprised by the magnitude of change and by the uniformity of it. It wasn't just a bunch of young liberals saying it, Morin said. Old and young, rich and poor, liberal and conservative alike agreed that tensions were running high between the social classes. ""That tells us something is very different about the social landscape,"" he said. However, the poll did find that younger adults, Democrats and African-Americans are somewhat more likely than older people, Republicans, whites or Hispanics to note strong conflict between rich and poor. For example, among Democrats in the Pew survey, 73% responded that class conflicts were serious; among Republicans, 55%. Obviously, Morin said, the downturn in the economy has been a driving force behind public perceptions. Then there was the spread of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the media attention to economic issues. ""These data suggest that it may have left its mark,"" he said. But that doesn't necessarily mean the poor are piling on grievances toward the rich. Nor is there growing support for government intervention to close the gap. ""In fact, other questions in the survey show that some key attitudes toward the wealthy have remained largely unchanged,"" the Pew poll said. ""For example, there has been no change in views about whether the rich became wealthy through personal effort or because they were fortunate enough to be from wealthy families or have the right connections."" In the survey, 46% said they believe that most rich people ""are wealthy mainly because they know the right people or were born into wealthy families."" Almost as many, 43%, said people were rich because of their own hard work, ambition or education, not much different than the 2008 results. Caroline Gray of Winnetka, Illinois, is only 16 but she is keenly aware of public perceptions. ""I think there definitely is much stronger conflict than there ever was before,"" she said. ""I live in a suburb of Chicago that is very wealthy. I see bad attitudes."" For one, she said, people who are wealthy tell her they are not willing to be taxed on their hard-earned money to help the poor. ""Somehow,"" Gray said, ""they think that they are better.' Chad Hale, executive director of the Georgia Avenue Community Ministry in Atlanta, senses a greater climate of fear and anxiety among the 275 families his program helps in the way of food. ""It feels like class tensions are rising,"" he said. ""I see it when I look at how those in power act in terms of resources. Those resources are allocated less and less to those who don't have. ""I think there is a general perception that overall, those who have the most have gained it at the expense of those who have the least by paying the least wages possible, by being greedy,"" Hale said. Discussion of class conflict reminds Hale of the comic strip ""Wizard of Id"" when it dealt with the topic of the war on poverty. ""I'm winning,"" the king replies. ""Those who have the most are winning, and they intend to keep it that way,"" Hale said. ""That's the general sense of the way things are in America.""

"Rome (CNN) -- About 30 bodies were found in a migrant boat rescued early Monday between Sicily and the North African coast, the Italian navy said. Italian media reported the boat had 600 people onboard. Italy has seen a series of tragedies as migrants in crowded boats cross from North Africa to Europe. In October, Lampedusa made international headlines when more than 300 African migrants died when their ship sank off its shores. As the closest Italian island to Africa, Lampedusa is a frequent destination for refugees seeking to enter European Union countries. Many of the migrants are from African nations while others have fled war-torn Syria. Hundreds more have been rescued from often unseaworthy vessels and taken to the tiny Mediterranean island's overcrowded detention center.","Italy has seen a series of tragedies as migrants cross from North Africa .

"(CNN) -- In the end, it was always Robin. That was the big bombshell from Monday night's final episode of ""How I Met Your Mother,"" which piled on one surprise after another. When Ted finally finished the story for his kids, they called him on it: His story wasn't all about how he met their mother (she was barely in the story), it was about how much he loved Robin. As many had theorized, the mother of Ted's children (whose name was Tracy McConnell, by the way), had been dead for years by the time he told his story. So, in the last of many flash-forwards in this finale, Ted went to the street in front of Robin's apartment and showed up with that blue French horn, the same one he stole for her in the first episode. Robin, of course, had long ago divorced Barney -- the first big shocker of the night. Barney, however, we would learn, became a father, and in one of several touching scenes from the episode, finally found the love of his life in baby Ellie. Marshall and Lily, pregnant with their second child in the present day, went on to have a third, but Lily was heartbroken when Robin decided she couldn't be as much a part of their gang anymore, due in part to Barney continuing to be, well, Barney around her. And what about the mother, aka Tracy? We finally did see that moment of the two meeting at that train station, and it was played perfectly by Josh Radnor and the Emmy-worthy Cristin Milioti. They wouldn't get married for several years, having postponed their wedding when Tracy got pregnant with their first child. Ted shared with his kids that he learned he had to love their mother with everything he had in him, through good times and bad, especially during her illness. Needless to say, the show stayed true to form, as it had in all its nine years, wearing its heart on its sleeve. And if your eyes stayed dry through the entire episode, you're probably a stronger person than most viewers. Of course, the big Robin twist didn't exactly sit well with everyone online (people such as Rocco Horvath @RoccoRacingAMA, who tweeted, ""It took me so long to get over the fact Ted and Robin weren't going to end up together and now this?! Mixed Emotions""), and the finale seems to have split viewers more than any since ""Lost."" Other viewers were more forgiving. ""#HIMYM creators stayed true to the story,"" tweeted fan John Eisele. ""Finale fit the show, even if it is not what I wanted. Can't stop thinking about it. #HIMYMFinale."" What do you think? Do you wish Tracy had stayed alive and Ted didn't ultimately end up with Robin? Or do you think it was a fitting ending? For that matter, what do you think about Barney and Robin splitting up?

"Iowa (CNN) -- The day did not start well. Lightning, thunder and torrential rain poured down over Bloomfield, Iowa, where I had come to watch a civil war reenactment. In 1864, here in Davis County, the Confederates made one of their most daring and northerly guerrilla raids of the war. Each year, enthusiasts from the Unionists and Confederates remember that battle. Amtrak train: No better way to connect with U.S. voters . I have chosen to leave Amtrak's California Zephyr train in Iowa, because this swing state is in play -- with President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney jockeying for the lead. While Iowa's six Electoral College votes may be few, at this stage of the campaign every one counts. And Iowa has split the last 10 elections five to five Republican and Democrat (although more Democrat since 1988). Crucially it has voted for the winner in seven of those ten races. This swing state could be a barometer of the way other swing states are trending. So I am at the battle ground, watching the men and women dressed in period costumes and waiting for the storms to subside (they will fight in the rain, but holding metal tipped muskets in the air is too dangerous with lightning).The attention to detail is impressive. Honest Abe's 19th century wisdom for 20th century problem . The players each have individual characters and play them with gusto, rarely coming out of role. One soldier would only answer me as if we were still in 1861. Another believed Abraham Lincoln had the right answers for today too. With muskets set aside, it soon became clear why this is a swing state. A Unionist soldier said it was only now that people like him were really focusing on their choices. His Confederate rival bemoaned the deceit in the campaign, which made it hard to know who was telling the truth. And the civil war nurse, tending to her potions and lotions, admitted it was hard to know who was best. American Quest begins in Obama country . At the core of the election, all agreed, was the role of government in America. Getting government ""out of our lives"" was the constant refrain. Government had gone too far, they believed. ""A return to the Constitution"" was needed I was told, again and again. There needed to be more respect for individual freedoms. ""Government"" was the problem, not the solution. Nowhere was this more crystallized than on the issue of gun control. I would hardly expect men and women running around the Iowa countryside brandishing civil war weaponry to favor stricter gun laws, but they believed their ""right to bear arms,"" enshrined in the second amendment, was under threat. Although neither candidate has really taken up the issue of gun control, here there was a stronger anti-Obama tone. Romney was the candidate of choice. Amish life: An America without sound bites . This ""role of government"" theme is now at the heart of the election. It permeates all issues: Economic: Should the government have rescued the banks in 2008? Social: Is it the government's business to legislate on marriage? In commerce the phrase I keep hearing is, ""get government off the backs of business,"" and in issues seen as highly personal, the refrain is ""that's none of the government's damned business."" Americans seem to want everything and nothing from their government at the same time. It is the great contradiction of this country, which makes covering its elections so fascinating.

"(CNN) -- World number one Novak Djokovic came back down to earth with a bump Thursday after being demolished 6-2, 6-2 by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the third round of the Toronto Masters. His honeymoon period following victory at Wimbledon and his recent wedding was quite literally over as he bowed out without even a wimper against the Frenchman, making 18 unforced errors and dropping his serve four times. The defeat had been on the cards, though, after needing close to three hours to beat Gael Monfils in the first round. ""Congratulations to Jo,"" Djokovic told the ATP's official website after the defeat. ""He played some great tennis. Served very well. He was obviously the better player on the court. I hadn't played even close to what I intended before going to the court. Just nothing was going. No baseline, no serve, no return. Generally a very bad day, very poor performance. Couldn't do much.""

"(CNN) -- There were goals, there was choreographed dancing, there were moments of great footballing beauty, but Colombia -- one of the teams to excite most at this thrilling World Cup finals -- is going home after Friday's quarterfinal defeat at the hands of Brazil in Fortaleza. Strikes from the center-back pairing of captain Thiago Silva and David Luiz put Brazil into an unassailable lead and, despite a late penalty by James Rodriguez, the tournament host held on to win 2-1. The home fans' jubilation was dampened, however, by an injury to Brazil's star striker Neymar, who was stretchered off in what seemed like considerable pain in the game's closing moments and will miss the rest of the tournament. The result marks the first time Brazil has reached the semifinal stage since winning the title in Japan and South Korea in 2002, and sets up an intriguing clash against Germany on Tuesday -- a repeat of that year's final. ""I think Neymar won't be able to play,"" coach Luiz Felipe Scolari told reporters after the game, before the team's doctor revealed the 22-year-old forward had a fractured vertebra from being kneed in the back by Colombia's Juan Zuniga. Germany overcame France in the day's earlier quarterfinal in Rio de Janeiro thanks to an early goal from defender Mats Hummels. In the sweaty evening heat of the Estadio Castelao, however, it was another pair of defenders who were the unlikely heroes. Silva opened the scoring after seven minutes, tucking home a Neymar corner with his knee, and the Paris Saint-Germain star was then in thick of it once more at the other end moments later, blocking a shot from Juan Cuadrado. Silva was criticized heavily after apparently refusing to take the sixth penalty in Brazil's round of 16 shootout victory over Chile last Saturday. He was all action here, however. Marshaling the back line and flying into tackles when required. But a yellow card midway through the second half means he will be suspended and miss the semifinal. The Colombia players composed themselves as the first half progressed, coming more into the game despite the rough-house treatment handed out to star player James Rodriguez. On at least four occasions the Monaco star was subject to the stray boot of Brazil's midfield enforcer Fernandinho. Still, the home team continued to have the better chances. Hulk and Fred came close with a snap-shot that Colombia keeper David Ospina palmed away and a header that flashed over respectively. The second half commenced at a far slower pace and there was little of note until Silva was booked for blocking a kick out from Ospina. Colombia did have the ball in the net after 66 minutes as Mario Yepes bundled the ball over the line after a scramble in the Brazilian box. But a linesman's offside flag cut short the nascent celebrations. Moments later there was a goal, although it was to come at the other end. Hulk was fouled by Rodriguez 35 yards from goal and Luiz stepped up to crash a spectacular free-kick beyond the despairing Ospina. It was a remarkable strike that dipped and swerved as it arrowed into the top corner of the net. There seemed no way back for Colombia now. But ""Los Cafeteros"" were handed a lifeline with 12 minutes to go after goalkeeper Julio Cesar scythed down substitute Carlos Bacca. Rodriguez did the honors from the penalty spot, sending Cesar the wrong way to score his sixth goal of the tournament -- two more than closest rivals Neymar, Lionel Messi and Thomas Muller. All of a sudden, the game was back on. Colombia pressed and threw caution to the wind with Yepes playing as an auxiliary striker. But when one final corner kick delivery drifted beyond Cesar's goal in the 95th minute there was time left for little else. Scolari's side has now overcome the barrier that has proved too high at the last two World Cup tournaments. However, Brazil has not yet looked like a team certain to become world champion for a record-extending sixth time -- as its demanding public expects -- despite having world-class talents like Neymar, Silva and Oscar. Yet somehow they find themselves only a game away from next Sunday's final. Stuttering performances and the occasional stroke of good fortune against Croatia and Mexico in the group stages and once more against Chile has hardly inspired confidence in ""A Selecao."" Poor showings from the likes of strikers Hulk and Fred have been singled out for particular scorn, although the former put in a solid performance against Colombia. Much was also made in the Brazilian media of 2002's winning coach Scolari -- a man who prides himself on being a father figure to his players -- bringing in a psychologist to speak to his team after many broke down in tears during the national anthems and once again after the dramatic penalty kicks victory over Chile. Was this team soft and mentally weak? Are the expectations of 200 million football-mad Brazilians proving oppressive and too much to bear? ""Big Phil"" truculently replied earlier this week that journalists who didn't like his methods could ""go to hell."" Whether said reporters took heed or not, surely lack of maturity is not an accusation that can be leveled against Brazil now. The men in yellow were nothing if not committed, controlled and tactically astute, biting into tackles and closing down with an intensity that ruffled their opponents. Several gestured towards the crowd throughout the contest to increase the noise and crank up the pressure. Colombia, by comparison, can hardly have been accused of being afraid. Jose Pekerman's team has played with a style and confidence throughout the tournament that has been a joy to watch for neutral observers. The delight the entire squad takes in their choreographed dancing celebrations, meanwhile, speaks to the relaxed vibe created by the coach, previously a World Cup quarterfinalist with his native Argentina in 2006. Tellingly, however, Colombia has only ever beaten Brazil twice and never in Brazil -- a run that extends all the way back to 1945 and the formative years of the Copa America. That record will now last at least until the two sides meet next in qualification for the next World Cup in the coming years. Still, today's Colombia players will be heading back homes as heroes, the bright hope of a new generation as the country itself moves on from a dark past. It was 20 years ago this week that defender Andres Escobar was murdered in Medellin upon returning from the 1994 World Cup in the U.S. where he scored a cruel own-goal. Thankfully, those dark days are largely gone and Colombian hopes will be high when the campaign for Russia 2018 begins. Brazil, however, is still involved in 2014 and will be going to the semifinals in Belo Horizonte.","Brazil beats Colombia in World Cup quarterfinal in Fortaleza .

"(CNN) -- A lawyer who served in the Clinton administration and more recently was an adviser to California's lieutenant governor pleaded guilty to a child porn charge in a San Diego federal court Monday. Wade Rowland Sanders admitted to having 600 images of minors on his computer, including a video depicting ""several prepubescent females engaged in sexual conduct with an adult male and performing oral sex on one another,"" according to a statement from U.S. Attorney Karen Hewitt. FBI agents raided Sanders' home last May after they suspected his home Internet service account was used to download several pictures and a video showing underage girls having sex with adult men, according to an investigator's sworn statement. ""Sanders admitted that he had downloaded child pornography using the program Limewire but that he deleted the files once he noticed that they had been downloaded,"" FBI Special Agent John Caruthers said. A search of Sanders' computer found the child porn files saved on his hard drive in two ""My Documents"" folders, Caruthers said. At least one of the young girls in the photos was identified and is a ""known victim,"" the investigator said. When Sanders, 67, is sentenced on March 30, he could get up to 10 years in prison and be ordered to pay a $250,000 fine. The minimum sentence for the charge is five years with supervised release for his lifetime and registration as a sex offender, the prosecutor said. FBI agents discovered the illegal downloads as part of a nationwide initiative called Project Safe Childhood. The multi-agency program, which began in 2006, is ""designed to combat the growing epidemic of child exploitation and abuse,"" the U.S. Attorney's statement said. Sanders was a U.S. Navy Swift boat captain during the Vietnam War, where he earned the Silver Star, Bronze Star and Purple Heart. He retired from the U.S. Navy as a captain. Sanders was chosen by fellow Swift boat veteran John Kerry to introduce him at the 2004 Democratic Convention, when the senator accepted the presidential nomination. He briefly entered the 2000 congressional race in a San Diego district, but withdrew citing lack of funding. He ran as a Democrat. Sanders served as the senior adviser to California Lt. Gov. John Garamendi for Veterans and Military Affairs until the time of his arrest, according to the U.S. Attorney's office. He was also in the Clinton administration as a deputy assistant secretary of the Navy. When Garamendi's office announced Sanders' appointment in July 2007, it said he was a practicing lawyer and a community activist. ""He is a member of the San Diego Police Department Senior Oversight Committee and has served on many non-profit boards,"" the lieutenant governor's office said.","Wade Rowland Sanders admitted to having 600 images of minors on his computer .

"(CNN) -- In 1951, a doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital removed two thin slivers of tissue from a dying woman's cervix. Cells from that biopsy would later multiply wildly and continuously -- a feat never seen until that time -- and become the cornerstone of research for diseases ranging from polio to Parkinson's disease. The woman's name was Henrietta Lacks. The cells, culled from her cancerous cervical tumor, are called HeLa. ""Her cells were part of research into the genes that cause cancer and those that suppress it; they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson's disease,"" wrote Rebecca Skloot in her book, ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks."" ""They helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization."" HeLa cells are arguably one of the most important contributions to medicine ever made. And they're still the most commonly used cells in research today, Skloot told CNN. But although the cells have been a boon for the scientific community, they have been a persistent source of pain for the Lacks family. Henrietta Lacks had no clue her cells would be used for research, and neither did her family. Decades after her death, scientists took tissue samples from other members of the Lacks family and tested them, never disclosing why they were doing it. For years companies have capitalized on discoveries made because of HeLa cells, and the family has not received any compensation. The third blow came earlier this year when scientists in Germany revealed that they had mapped the full HeLa genome and posted the results to a public database. The Lacks family did not consent to release the information. ""It was repeating this history, this chapter of the family being thrust into some kind of research without their consent,"" said Skloot. But a new agreement between the National Institutes of Health and the Lacks family, the details of which were published in the journal Nature Wednesday, is meant to alter the narrative about HeLa. As part of the agreement, the NIH and the Lacks family will control access to the HeLa genome -- including an even more specific analysis recently completed by scientists at the University of Washington -- so that researchers receiving NIH funds would have to apply to use the data. Labs not funded by the NIH would not be required to adhere to the agreement. ""We urge the research community to act responsibly and honor the family's wishes,"" said Kathy Hudson, deputy director for science, outreach and public policy at the NIH and Francis Collins, director of the agency, in a commentary published in Nature. ""Downloading the HeLa sequence through controlled access is the right and respectful thing to do."" In some respects, the damage is done. Snippets of information about the HeLa genome have been widely reported over the years, and with them, sensitive information about the diseases to which the Lacks family may be susceptible. ""What happened with Henrietta Lacks is beyond-the-pale horrible, and we don't want that to happen again,"" said Dr. Robert Klitzman, director of the Masters of Bioethics Program at Columbia University and author of ""Am I My Genes?: Confronting Fate and Family Secrets in the Age of Genetic Testing."" ""We owe it to people to give them a choice: 'Do you want to do this research even if it is a potential risk to your privacy?'"" The privacy problem is not unique to the Lacks family. Parents shocked to learn examiner kept son's brain . For patients, a routine hospital visit to draw blood or excise a growth could result in excess cells or tissue being stored and later used for research, albeit with identifying information removed. ""Let's say scientists have all this leftover blood containing patients' genes and next year they discover that a certain mutation makes someone more likely to get a disease, but we never asked you if you want us to look at your blood,"" said Klitzman. ""Science is advancing. We have hundreds of thousands of specimens of DNA, so this is going to be a major ongoing problem."" A report issued in 1999 by the RAND Corporation estimates that more than 307 million tissue specimens are stored in the United States, with approximately 20 million added annually. Conventional wisdom has been that as long as the samples are anonymous, even if the genetic information is shared publicly, the patient is protected. Not necessarily, says Klitzman. Using current technology, some of which is easily found on the Internet, genetic information could be paired with seemingly insignificant demographic information to stitch together a person's identity. In July 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed rules to protect patients whose genetic material could be used for study, and invited public comment. According to the notice, ""...rapidly evolving advances in technology coupled with the increasing volume of data readily available may soon allow identification of an individual from data that is currently considered de-identified."" But since the notice was issued, ""no resolution has been released,"" said Klitzman, leaving a gaping hole in protections for patients. ""Future cures will come of this,"" said Skloot. ""But it needs to be handled in a way that protects people's privacy so people know what they're getting into when they donate. We aren't in a place where people understand what's happening."" As for the family whose experience sparked this whole debate, their agreement with the NIH gives a sense about where they stand. The Lacks family is willing to give scientists what they want, provided their genetic information is respected. ""They get so much pride out of what HeLa cells have done for society and the world,"" said Skloot. ""They want HeLa cells to continue to do good. They just want to be part of the conversation.""","Scientists took cells from Henrietta Lacks' cancerous cervical tumor in 1951 .
Those cells, called HeLa cells, have been used in many scientific discoveries .
The family is concerned about their privacy, and has not been compensated .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Malaysian police are still searching for a Pakistani national over the alleged theft of money from bank accounts belonging to four people aboard missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, according to Malaysian investigators. ""We are still trying to locate this Ali Farran, who last worked as a car mechanic,"" Assistant Commissioner Izany Abdul Ghany of the Kuala Lumpur Commercial Crime Investigation Department said Monday. Authorities have arrested two people in relation to the alleged theft: an HSBC bank officer and her husband. The bank officer is accused of using Internet banking to transfer money from four passengers' bank accounts into another passenger's account. About $10,000 (35,000 Malaysian ringgit) was then allegedly transferred to a fifth account belonging to Farran, police said. In total, about $35,000 (110,600 Malaysian ringgit) was reported missing from the accounts of two Chinese passengers, Ju Kun and Tian Jun Wei, and two Malaysians, Hue Pui Heng and flight steward Tan Size Hian. Police have yet to charge the couple, who have been in police custody since their arrest on Thursday. ""We have extended the remand order for the two until Wednesday to facilitate in the investigations,"" Izany said. HSBC's Malaysian branch said it notified police of potential fraud involving the accounts. ""HSBC is deeply sorry for this incident and apologizes to the families of our customers for the distress this will cause and assures them there will be no losses on these accounts,"" a spokeswoman said. Flight 370 went missing en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8. Extensive land and sea searches have failed to find any sign of the Boeing 777-200ER, which was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew. It's believed the plane crashed into the southern Indian Ocean, west of Australia. This month, Australian officials announced that Dutch company Fugro Survey would take over the next phase of the search, which was likely to start in September. The company will use two ships equipped with towed deep-water vehicles, as well as side-scan sonar, multibeam echo sounders and video cameras, to search an area of 60,000 square kilometers (23,000 square miles) and depths of up to 7,000 meters (four miles).

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration proposed updated guidelines on Friday that would allow religious-affiliated organizations opposing contraception to opt out of a federal mandate requiring that they provide their employees with insurance coverage for birth control. The draft rule would give women at non-profit, religious-based organizations, like certain hospitals and universities, the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies at no charge. The compromise is consistent with last year's announcement by President Barack Obama on the contraception mandate, administration officials said. It also continues his administration's attempts to resolve the contentious issue of how non-profit organizations can decline to provide contraception coverage to their employees on religious grounds without facing a penalty. ""Today, the administration is taking the next step in providing women across the nation with coverage of recommended preventive care at no cost, while respecting religious concerns,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement. ""We will continue to work with faith-based organizations, women's organizations, insurers and others to achieve these goals,"" she said. As part of the new initiative, groups that are insured -- such as student health plans at religious colleges -- would be required to let their insurer know that certain participants would like contraception coverage. ""The insurer would then notify enrollees that it is providing them with no-cost contraceptive coverage through separate individual health insurance policies,"" the HHS statement said. Although the agency has not estimated final costs of the plan, it said that offering free coverage would actually lower expenses over the long term, partly due to improvement in women's health and fewer childbirths. Case fuels debate over when life begins . Because the insurer would be covering the costs, the changes would allow religious organizations morally opposed to contraception to avoid paying for it. An original mandate on providing contraception was part of the new federal healthcare law spearheaded by Obama, the Affordable Care Act. It required that insurers provide, at no cost to those insured, all forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Houses of worship were exempt immediately and the administration widened those exemptions last year to include other religiously affiliated organizations, like universities and hospitals. That still left groups across a wide spectrum of faiths, many of which teach that contraception is morally wrong, covered by the mandate. They denounced it as an infringement of religious liberty. A group of 43 Catholic organizations challenged the rules in federal court in May. The administration had long defended the mandate, saying that it did not violate religious liberties. The new proposal also clarifies the definition of a religious employer. Instead of using a multi-part test that requires an employer to show ""religious values as its purpose"" and to ""employ persons who share its religious tenets,"" the proposed requirement would follow the International Revenue Code's definition that includes ""churches, other houses of worship, and their affiliated organizations."" Following an uproar among religious institutions that didn't want to pay for contraceptives, the Obama administration in March offered several alternatives. The plan unveiled on Friday is a result of that effort. The updated rules proposal will be open for public comment through April 8. The administration would then decide whether to make it final. A source with knowledge of the matter but not authorized to speak on the record said administration officials planned to discuss the new plan with faith-based organizations on Friday. The source also said the administration called key leaders, including presidents of Catholic universities, before the announcement. Women's groups, including Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America, heralded the announcement . ""Today's draft regulation affirms yet again the Obama administration's commitment to fulfilling the full promise of its historic contraception policy,"" said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL. ""Thanks to this commitment, most American women will get birth control coverage without extra expense."" ""This policy makes it clear that your boss does not get to decide whether you can have birth control,"" said Cecile Richards, President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, took a wait-and-see approach. Lawyers for Catholic hospital argue that a fetus is not a person . Today, the administration issued proposed regulations regarding the HHS mandate"" he said in a statement. ""We welcome the opportunity to study the proposed regulations closely. We look forward to issuing a more detailed statement later."" Not all groups characterized it as a compromise, however. Frank Pavone, National Director of Priests for Life, a group that launched a federal lawsuit against the mandate last year, said he was far from happy with the update and welcomes the opportunity to provide feedback. ""We at Priests for Life remind the administration that religious liberty does not just belong to religious groups and individuals; it belongs to all Americans,"" Pavone said. ""We see only one acceptable change regarding the mandate: rescind it completely."" The Family Research Council, a conservative pro-life group, released a similar statement. ""The proposal does not expand religious freedom to all organizations and does nothing to change the current policy that forces religious entities to pay for insurance plans that include abortion-inducing drugs, sterilizations and contraception,"" said Anna Higgins, director of the group's Center for Human Dignity. The issue of Obama's health care act mandating contraception coverage became a hot-button political issue during last year's presidential race. CNN's Jessica Yellin, Eric Marrapodi and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.","Proposed rules would permit certain groups like hospitals, schools to decline to provide contraception coverage for religious reasons .
But women would still get coverage; outside provider would pay for contraception separately .

"(CNN) -- If you've been dreaming of your own scrambler phone since watching Bond movies as a kid, your time has come. As more business is done by email and more sensitive personal data is passed by phone, the demand for secure communication is growing. Employers can't always stop staff using their own insecure laptops for work and many of us are asked to provide a credit card number over the phone on a weekly basis. Governments want to know who we're talking to and marketing firms make it their business to know. Enter stage left a veteran of internet privacy. Phil Zimmermann is known for inventing the standard in email encryption -- PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) -- in the 1990s and for giving it away to the world for free, much to the annoyance of the U.S. government, which considered encryption software to be weaponry at the time and therefore restricted for export. Now he has a new bag of tricks which, from next month, will allow customers to scramble their mobile phone calls, text messages, emails and even video calls. His company Silent Circle has a suite of four products that go live on September 17, and will be available to download worldwide to iPhones, Androids, desktops and laptops. Silent Circle's chief operating officer Vic Hyder is one of two former Navy SEALs working with Zimmermann and PGP Corporation co-founder Jon Callas. He says one of the driving forces for establishing the firm was U.S. armed forces personnel not being able to make secure calls home when posted overseas. ""With 25 years in the Navy, I know all about that,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to take care of your personal business."" The software is for use over a private network, subscription to which costs $20 a month. This is because the encryption works on a peer-to-peer basis, so both parties ideally need to be within the system. It still works if only one person uses the app, but in that case a message will only be scrambled as far as Silent Circle's servers. Once downloaded, the software generates a code that scrambles messages on that device. The code is used only once and then destroyed. If, say, someone steals your laptop and somehow breaks the code, they still can't read your other messages. From nabbing data from open Wi-Fi networks as people send crucial emails in airports, to planting a virus that captures every keystroke as you enter your passwords, industrial espionage has become almost easy. ""We have a fashion designer who sends her designs to her production facility in China,"" says Hyder. ""Before the first template's come out, it's already been sold in Pakistan or Bangladesh."" See also: 3-D printing -- the shape of things to come . Another customer is a Canadian bank, Hyder, says, which wants to offer secure lines to its customers so that it isn't liable for their account data being disclosed over the phone if it gets into the wrong hands. Silent Circle, itself based in National Harbor, in Maryland, and in Silicon Valley, has located its servers in Canada because it feels the country has superior privacy laws. Governments around the world have various regulations allowing government agencies to look at certain private electronic communications. Jonathan Evans, the head of British spy network MI5, recently defended proposals allowing greater surveillance of internet use, saying it was needed to keep pace with criminals and terrorists adopting new communications technology. But growing government surveillance has raised privacy concerns. PGP was originally designed as a human-rights tool and civil liberties groups are likely to welcome Silent Circle as a boon for Arab Spring-era democracy campaigns. Eric King, head of research for privacy campaign group Privacy International, in London, said he expected the product to be genuinely secure and easy to use. ""Phil and his team have pedigree in this field, so this is probably good news for anyone that values their privacy -- from businessmen in London to human rights defenders in Syria,"" he said. He added, however, that he awaited independent reviews of the service. Zimmermann has always felt strongly about the right to private communication in the digital age and feels that it should be simple -- you dial a number and no one else can listen; you shouldn't have to be a rocket scientist to make your conversations secure. ""I should be able to whisper in your ear, even if your ear is a thousand miles away,"" he said in a promotional video for Silent Circle. Hyder said the company had received interest in its products ""from Hong Kong to Chile, from the Czech Republic to Uganda."" He added that he expected some governments would be concerned about their citizens keeping their communications private. ""They would have to block the website -- but that would be good marketing for the service,"" he joked.","Silent Circle encryption software will be available for phones and computers .
Secure calls for military personnel serving overseas was one driver for the product .

"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico (CNN) -- It's the life Sara Wise always dreamed of: a place with unbeatable weather, sunny beaches, good medical care and an active social life -- and all at very affordable prices. The former manager of retail businesses didn't find what she wanted in her native U.S., but rather just south of the border in Mexico. For the last six years, the 63-year-old Minnesotan and her 70-year-old husband Mike Wise, both retired, have been enjoying the warm weather and friendly beaches of Puerto Vallarta, a resort on the Pacific coast. They have a very active social life and say they have more friends in Mexico than they ever did in the United States, mainly because Puerto Vallarta is full of people just like them. According to local government estimates, there are around 35,000 U.S. and Canadian citizens living in Puerto Vallarta, many of them retired like Mike and Sara. ""We get together and we have happy hours, we have wine and appetizers, we have coffees in different neighborhoods and we get together at different restaurants,"" Sara Wise says. Medical care is another factor they considered when they decided to move here. To their surprise, they found more options for quality health care and at much more affordable prices than in the United States, including procedures like surgeries and advanced dental care. ""The accessibility to the doctors is something that we never experienced in the United States and from what we understand it's getting more difficult, not less,"" Mike Wise says. ""And the cost is somewhere between a quarter to a half of what things cost in the U.S."" Puerto Vallarta has adapted to this relatively new, foreign clientele. Around town, doctors and dentists put out signs in English, and often have English-speaking employees. Kimberly Altman, 63, a retiree from California who has been living in Puerto Vallarta for three-and-a-half years, says a doctor's visit is usually $40. ""No matter what they do, $40 per visit and you can get to see them the very same day you need them. It's very convenient in a lot of ways,"" Altman says. Mike Altman, 68, Kimberly's husband, says affordability goes well beyond just medical care. For him, part of the beauty of living in Puerto Vallarta is how far dollars go when it comes to real estate. ""We have an ocean view, 3,000-square-foot condominium that I can afford on my Social Security. How's that? We have 24-hour security and indoor parking,"" Altman says. According to the U.S. Department of State, 1 million American citizens of all ages live in Mexico, and 20.3 million visited as tourists -- making it the No. 1 destination for U.S. travelers. The number of expats living in Mexico has continued to grow, local officials say, despite safety concerns from the drug violence which has made headlines around the world.

"Vero Beach, Florida (CNN) -- Enough with the texting, a Florida judge told Kaitlyn Hunt after hearing testimony about thousands of text messages -- some of them explicit -- the Florida teenager reportedly sent to her underage girlfriend after being ordered not to while awaiting trial on charges of having sex with the girl. Judge Robert Pegg sent Hunt, 19, to jail Tuesday, ordering her held on bond pending trial. She'll also be limited to communicating with her lawyers, guards, fellow inmates and perhaps a few choice visitors. Hunt was 18 when she was charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after allegedly having sexual relations with the girl, who was 14. Pegg made his ruling after an Indian River Sheriff's Office detective testified about the contents of an iPod that Hunt had given the younger girl -- including more than 20,000 text messages, ""explicit"" videos and nude pictures -- despite a court order that the two not communicate, electronically or otherwise. ""It's overwhelming that Ms. Hunt has chosen to violate the conditions of her bond deliberately and willfully on several occasions,"" Pegg said in explaining his decision. In addition to the extensive exchange of messages since March -- which began days after the no-contact order was issued -- Detective Jeremy Shepherd further testified that he'd learned the two had secretively met as recently as a few weeks ago. Under cross-examination, Shepherd noted that in some cases, the younger girl initiated contact, though he emphasized that Hunt had given her the iPod on which they illicitly communicated. And the detective added, the younger teenager ""has not told me the full truth in a couple of my interviews."" After Shepherd left the stand, Hunt's lawyer, Julia Graves, did not dispute that there ""has been some contact with the victim"" and her client. ""We're not going to contest all the evidence,"" Graves said Tuesday in court. ""But what we would ask for is that the defendant (be able to be) bonded out, to be placed on house arrest without any electronic communication of any kind. ... We think that would keep the judicial process safe."" The judge, though, thought differently. ""She simply can't be trusted to abide by the court order,"" Pegg said of Hunt. The court hearing Tuesday was graphic and, for Hunt, emotional. She held a tissue in her handcuffed hands that she repeatedly used to wipe tears from her eyes. The proceeding marked the latest turn in a story that first captured the nation's attention months ago. In a written statement Wednesday, Graves slammed the prosecutors for disclosing sordid detail. Hunt's family says the relationship was consensual, with their lawyer claiming authorities wouldn't have gone after her if it had involved a male and a female instead of two teenage girls. In Florida, a person under the age of 16 is not legally able to consent to sex. Hunt's parents went public with their story after their daughter was charged. They essentially accused the alleged victim's family of going after their daughter because she is gay, while Hunt spoke out about her fears of paying for a relationship that she didn't think was wrong. ""I'm scared of losing my life, the rest of my life,"" she said earlier this year, ""not being able to go to college or be around kids, be around my sisters and my family."" The younger girl's family, though, said that wasn't true and insisted that they were only trying to protect their own daughter. ""We had no other alternative but to turn to the law, use it basically as a last resort,"" the victim's father, Jim Smith, had previously told CNN affiliate WPEC. Sheriff: Teen sex case is about age, not gay rights . This debate has been playing out publicly since Hunt was charged, during which time prosecutors offered her at least two plea deals. The most recent one -- offered in July, according to Bruce Colton, the state attorney for Florida's 19th judicial circuit -- would have led to Hunt being subject to a curfew and having to do community service, but avoiding jail time and not having to register as a sex offender. But Hunt's defense team didn't accept either plea deal. Then, on August 6, the victim's father alerted authorities to the iPod and its contents, Shepherd said. He interviewed the underage girl the next day, when she told him she'd given Hunt her locker combination and found the iPod in her locker on the last day Hunt was in their school. This type of iPod allows people to exchange text messages and other media. On some of those texts, Hunt indicated that she understood that such communications violated the court order. ""No matter what, if they find out that we talked, I'm going to jail until the trial starts,"" she wrote, according to Shepherd. Pictures on the iPod showed the young couple together and a nude Hunt. There was also video of a naked Hunt touching herself in a sexual manner, the detective testified. Authorities determined these images originated at Hunt's home in the weeks and months after the no-contact order had been issued, said Shepherd. Graves, in her Wednesday statement, upbraided prosecutors for using frank and graphic detail in a court filing. ""What happened to a (statements) like 'numerous texts and inappropriate language' without details?"" she wrote. With the school year starting, she said, ""I can only imagine the chatter at the school."" In the end, Graves wrote, two teen students were ""involved in a consensual relationship."" ""Yes one that under the current law is a crime, but still consensual. It was brought to an abrupt end and the older 'adult' teen faces up to 30 years in prison."" She said the younger girl ""cannot comprehend the seriousness of the matter because it was something she consented to."" ""Her opinion is ignored by the State,"" Graves said. The girl has been ""interrogated by the Sheriff's Department, taken to a church that labels being gay a sin, has the Bible thrown at her, all of her things in her room boxed up and taken from her, is apparently hit by her parents, and clearly yelled at for lying by her father in the presence of Detective Shepherd at the school in a subsequent interview."" Under the circumstances, she's been confused, scared, and feels no one is listening to her, Graves said. ""She already tried to speak to Kaitlyn's mother Kelley who shut her down. So she turns to the only person who could (possibly) understand in her eyes and a person she clearly does not want to see hurt and that is Kaitlyn. She wants to try to save her and in doing so she just causes the walls to continue to tumble down."" Hunt, who turned 19 last week, was booked into detention Monday night after her bail bond company declined to secure her $5,000 bond any longer and picked her up. Her family has not commented on the latest developments in the case. The original charges against Hunt carry a maximum of 15 years in prison upon conviction. Based on the newly revealed evidence, prosecutors filed a new charge against Hunt for ""transmission of material harmful to minor by electronic equipment.""

"(CNN) -- African art has long been about more than just tribal masks and traditional carvings, and now contemporary African artists are being recognized globally. The Johannesburg Art Fair recently showcased the works of 400 African contemporary artists, attracting more than 10,000 visitors. Organizer Ross Douglas told CNN there had been an explosion of interest in African art in recent years. ""Africa has always had a strong tribal art and a strong craft component, and that will always stay, he said. ""But that doesn't mean there can't be a contemporary market existing alongside that, and if you look in South Africa at the contemporary market in the last four or five years, it's absolutely exploded. ""If you look at the number of young black artists doing well, making a living, it's extraordinary. Five years ago it just didn't exist."" But the attention being bestowed on contemporary African art is a relatively new phenomenon. Auction house Bonhams says its New York sale last month was the first commercial auction dedicated solely to contemporary African art in the United States, and it says the UK's first auction only took place last year. While auction house Phillips de Pury's Africa art sale and exhibition will take place on May 15 in New York. The sale will include works of contemporary art, photographs, design and editions which reflect the spirit of the continent. Somali sisters journey from civil war to New York fashionistas . Giles Peppiatt, director of African art at Bonhams, said these kinds of sales were still too rare. ""In some ways it's remarkable -- here we are in 2010 and this is the first auction of its type in New York,"" he told CNN. ""It's never been done before. Actually I was very surprised by that,"" But he says he's not surprised by the growing interest in African art. Bonhams says the auction has generated considerable buzz. Prince Yemisi Shyllon, who has an extensive collection of Nigerian art, was one of those in attendance. Shyllon told CNN, ""I don't promote Nigerian art in terms of the value. I promote in terms of the benefits and the joy it can confer to the world."" But monetary value is unavoidable at an art auction. About half of the 140 pieces at the Bonhams auction sold, with prices ranging from $1,000 to $92,000. The value of African art could increase as international interest develops and the buying pool expands. ""At the moment the majority of the collectors are people who have an interest or contact with Africa,"" said Peppiatt. ""We aren't yet seeing these people buying these works without that connection. ""Look at the other markets -- no one buys a van Gogh because he's Dutch or because the buyer's Dutch. It doesn't matter where the artist was born or what nationality he was. But I think with the African art it still does matter. It hasn't yet broken into the international market."" Ghana's beads back in vogue . While the rest of the world is catching up with African art, the artists themselves continue to push artistic boundaries. South African Lawrence Lemaoana was one of the artists exhibiting at last month's Johannesburg Art Fair. His work is all about challenging the traditional. ""I look at the ideas of stereotypes, and the idea of men sewing and the idea of how that's a feminine activity ... [and ask] how do we subvert that into something that's really not feminine? So I am sewing and I am making artwork that's quite edgy,"" Lemaoana told CNN. ""Artists are not limited to painting and traditional ways of making art. There are other possibilities of speaking a language and finding new and innovative ways of communicating."" Nkepile Mabuse, Isha Sesay and Mark Tutton contributed to this report .","Market for contemporary African art has exploded in the last five years, says expert .

"New York (CNN) -- Buddy ""Cake Boss"" Valastro's gastronomical gifts were of little help when his 32-foot Boston Whaler got lost in heavy fog in New York Harbor. ""People were scared,"" Valastro told CNN of the harrowing journey Friday night with his wife, another couple and nine young children. ""I didn't know which way to look -- left, right. I couldn't even see in front of me."" Both New York fire and police department units located and safely towed Valastro's boat to Liberty Landing Marina in Jersey City, New Jersey, NYPD Sgt. Carlos Nieves said. The vessel typically docks at Liberty Landing, which sits on the other side of the Hudson River from New York City and not far from the Statue of Liberty. Police said authorities received an emergency call about 9:30 p.m.: A boat was stranded and its captain disoriented just south of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The vessel was lost in thick fog in Ambrose Channel, a busy shipping channel that put it in danger of colliding with large commercial ships, police said. Valastro said they were lost about 20 minutes before he called for help. The ordeal started about 8:30 p.m. after Valastro and his friends had dinner in Highlands, New Jersey, and were taking the boat back home. ""I can't see the city,"" said Valastro, who had owned a boat for about six years. ""I'm thinking it's dark... We wind up going into this deep, deep fog where you couldn't see 10 feet in front of you. We started to get really scared."" At one point, Valastro said, a bigger vessel about 30 feet away was headed straight for his boat. ""I saw him but I don't think he saw us,"" he recalled. ""We had to get out of the way... I turned quick. It got really, really scary. I said,' You know, it's time to call for help."" The boat moved slowly in the dense fog, he said. The children cried. Some were seasick and vomited overboard. ""My wife was flipping,"" he said. ""I couldn't pick a worse bunch of people to be on the boat stuck in the fog with. All the kids were under 10 years old ... then my wife and my friend's wife and my friend... After we got rescued, we started joking and having some fun. But it was no joke. "" Nieves said police inspected the boat and found no alcohol on board or equipment violations. Valastro showed no signs of impairment, police said. Valastro said a fire department vessel responded about 10 minutes after his distress call, followed later by a police boat. ""I want to bake them a cake,"" he said. ""I want to do something good for them. They didn't even realize who I was until the end. It was all business. I'm not the kind of guy to say, 'I'm the Cake Boss. The Cake Boss in distress. May Day."" Valastro, who starred on the hit TLC show ""Cake Boss,"" now appears in the competition series ""Next Great Baker"" on Tuesdays. A fourth-generation baker, he runs Carlo's Bake Shop in Hoboken, New Jersey. After Friday's odyssey, the Cake Boss tweeted: ""Next time we go out at night need to check the forecast #mywifewantstokillme"". 2 tread water for 14 hours off Florida coast until chance rescue .","Buddy ""Cake Boss"" Valastro, his wife and friends were rescued after his boat was stranded .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraq's state-owned oil exploration company has made the country's first oil find in 30 years, an Oil Ministry spokesman said Monday. The company found at least a billion barrels of crude under the ground in a southeastern province near the border with Iran, spokesman Assim Jihad said Monday. The discovery in Maysan, about 350 kilometers (215 miles) south of Baghdad, is a ""significant achievement"" for the country, Jihad said. Despite vast reserves and reliance on oil for government income, exploration in Iraq has been hindered by decades of conflict. With the world's fourth-largest oil reserves, Iraq's government depends on oil revenues to fund more than 90% of its budget. The discovery comes seven months after exploratory drilling began, Jihad said. Iraq produces 3.2 million barrels of oil a day, exporting 72% of it, he said. In 2010, Iraqi officials estimated the country had 143 billion barrels of extractable oil, most of it in the southern oil fields.","Iraq announces first oil discovery in 30 years .

"(CNN) -- It is widely recognized that the signing of the Armistice in 1918 did not put an end to the drama that began in 1914. Traditional geopolitical rivalries continued but now overlapped with competing ideologies of fascism and Stalinism to foster a climate of permanent war. That is why many observers at the time described the period 1914-1945 as a modern version of the Thirty Years War. Yet this second Thirty Years War soon gave way to the four decades-long Cold War. For a very brief moment the demise of the Cold War appeared to bring to an end the conflicts unleashed on the battlefields in 1914. But this ""End of History"" moment was brief. Today we are in the midst of a conflict originally designated as a ""War on Terror"" but which has been rebranded by the American government as the ""Long War"" and more recently as ""Overseas Contingency Operation."" The conflicts unleashed in 1914 were not confined to the military sphere. They were also a battle of ideas and a clash of cultures. The story that began in 1914 was influenced by a crisis of meaning that afflicted the political and cultural elites of western societies. A powerful mood of estrangement and disorientation dominated cultural life. In this moment of confusion even artists and intellectual sought meaning through fighting for a cause -- even a military one. Some of the most enthusiastic supporters of the war were motivated by a disposition to react against what they took to be the soulless world of capitalist modernity. Stefan Zweig, the renowned Austrian novelist, playwright and well-known pacifist lived to see two world wars. When the Great War broke out in 1914, he along with almost all European intellectuals, supported his nation's war effort. Later, with a hint of embarrassment he recalled the sense of excitement and celebration that the news of the impending conflict provoked among people. ""And to be truthful, I must acknowledge that there was a majestic, rapturous, and even seductive something in this first outbreak of the people from which one could escape only with difficulty,"" he recalled. World War I would be the last time that a significant body of intellectuals and artists would seek existential meaning on the battlefield. But conflicts over norms and values, which were crystallized through their quest for meaning continues to this day. Indeed on hindsight it is evident that the Great War was a catalyst for eroding the prevailing system of meaning and helped intensify a clash of values. That is why the origins of what is currently described as the Culture Wars can be situated at some time around August 1914. Culture became politicized and geopolitical ambitions were framed through appeals to a ""way of life."" Today, very few respectable intellectuals would be caught waving the flag. Instead of the flag, competing groups flaunt their identity and instead of celebrating their way of life they acclaim their lifestyle. With the demise of old ideologies the politicization of culture has acquired an increasingly unrestrained character. It is worth noting that most of the high-profile divisive issues -- family life, gay marriage, abortion, assisted suicide, multiculturalism -- express conflicts over cultural values. These symbolic struggles over the constitution of legitimate lifestyles continually exacerbate the fragmentation of social life. What's more disturbing is that such struggles increasingly extend into global affairs. The current conflict between Russia and its Western opponents is almost entirely conducted through the medium of culture. The denunciation of Putin as an authoritarian homophobe is self-consciously countered by the claim that Russia stands firm as the bastion of traditional values. Like Putin, many Muslims also take their stand on hallow grounds of tradition. Young Western Muslims self-consciously reject the values of the communities where they grew up and embrace a call to arms for a war of cultures. Jihadist videos often communicate a simple message -- which is that the Jihad provides quest for meaning. As I write, the war drums are again beating. Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the head of ISIS, has declared the establishment of a new caliphate in the Middle East. His object is to abolish one legacy of World War I, the border between Syria and Iraq. There is still no end in sight to the Great War.","The period 1914-1945 was once described as a modern version of the Thirty Years War .

"(CNN) -- Like what you've seen so far? Well, the World Cup will dish up even more soccer superlatives as the ""Round of 16"" kicks off on Saturday. After surviving the ""Group of Death,"" the U.S. soccer team will have to duck a knockout punch this week. Or throw one themselves. With the complicated math of group play gone, the elimination principal will take to the pitch with the squads. That means it's win or go home. Team USA has to knock Belgium out cold to advance to the quarterfinals. That's not until Tuesday. But wait! Leave that TV on! Nascent U.S. footy fans shouldn't get tempted to take a break along with the home team they've newly fallen in love with, or they'll miss big games like Mexico vs. Netherlands on Sunday -- and the ultimate futbol acrobats on Saturday: . They're the beauty in the ""beautiful game,"" the big kahuna, the unmatched five-time World Cup champions, the team sportscasters call ""The Scratch"" -- that has proven that soccer can be better than you-know-what: Brazil. Here are this weekend's four knockout matches with viewing times and channels -- and at bottom, a fun way to find a love match and score yourself at the cup. 1. ""The Scratch"" Brazil vs. Chile, noon ET Saturday on ABC, Univision . Despite the home field advantage, the Brazilian team is getting the jitters as rival Chile approaches, Brazil's coach told the BBC. But that's ""normal,"" he said. It doesn't seem to calm their nerves that FIFA ranks Chile's team 14th and Brazil's 3rd in the world. -- Or that Brazil has won 48 of the two teams' 68 previous face-offs. -- Or that it scored 159 goals vs. 58 for Chile in those matches. -- Or that Brazil has shot seven goals in this tournament so far to Chile's five. -- Or that Brazil has fired 23 shots on target at the goal at this World Cup compared to 10 for Chile. Forget all of it. It doesn't matter. FIFA ranked Spain No. 1, and they've already gone home. If Chile gets just one more point than Brazil -- just the right ankle-breaking dance to the goal by maestro forward Alexis Sanchez -- or if their impenetrable goalie Claudio Bravo holds off one last goal attempt by Brazil. Then Brazil goes home, too. Er, uh, wait. They're home already. But they'd have to sit in the stands in front of the whole country without that sixth championship star on their jerseys. 2. The bite . Colombia vs. Uruguay, 4 p.m. ET Saturday on ABC, Univision . It's almost like Colombia never lost star striker Radamel Falcao to injury even before the cup started. They ate up their competitors in Group C play and go to the knockout round euphoric. And at the same time, Uruguay literally lost a lot of its bite this week when FIFA suspended forward Luis Suarez for four months for ... well ... biting another player. He's a massive scorer -- saved his team after it lost to Costa Rica 3-1 in Group D play. He shot both goals, when Uruguay downed England 2-1. Uruguay's team is raving mad at FIFA for sending Suarez home. Maybe it will give the team the fire in the belly it needs to keep from joining him at Colombia's hands. In their previous matchups, Uruguay has come out on top much more often. And they've still got forward Edinson Cavini, whom FIFA calls ""a born goalscorer."" And he has a reputation for being much more laid back than Suarez. Sports clothier Adidas has had some fun with the infamous chomp. 3. Big cheese or whole enchilada . Netherlands vs. Mexico, noon ET Sunday, ESPN, Univision . Call it Offense vs. Defense. The Netherlands are to Europe what Wisconsin is to the United States in its clichéd role as a cheese maker -- although in reality, the European Union says Germany and France make more of it. But Holland has the stuff to be the big cheese of global soccer this year. The guys in screaming orange jerseys have shot the most goals in this year's World Cup -- 10, compared to the top two seeds -- Germany's and Brazil -- which have seven each. They dominated their group, roundly stomping reigning world champ Spain 5-1 in their first game. Mexico has played more defense than offense, scoring only four goals so far but also allowing only one. They held Brazil to a 0-0 tie. But Mexico may have just turned up the heat. It looks like their scoring hope Javier Hernandez just got cranked in their 3-1 win against Croatia. If they beat the Dutch, they would reach the level of their best ever performance at the World Cup. They've only previously made it to the group of eight twice before. 4. Pleased to meet you. Now, please, go home! Costa Rica vs. Greece, 4 p.m. ET Sunday, ESPN, Univision . They've never met on a World Cup pitch before. And it's no wonder. This is only Costa Rica's third appearance at a World Cup, and only Greece's second. Greece has shot only two goals so far this tournament but also allowed only one. Costa Rica has shot twice as many, while allowing only one and putting away major contenders Italy and Uruguay. Sound like Greece is the underdog? Consider that FIFA ranks the team 12th in the world and Costa Rica 28th. Remember many good things come from Greece, even if they are from Brazil: . 5. Scoring apps . No, no, not apps to keep score of the game. Apps to find the right match -- as in people to date. Tinder and Blendr are dating apps for smart phones, and they're booming in Brazil at the World Cup. With more than 600,000 fans pouring into Brazil for the tournament, Tinder says usage and downloads here have jumped 50%. Many locals are using it to meet visitors from around the world. At bars and open-air fan game viewing sites, people are checking their smart phones to see how many new matches they have -- and the apps turn up plenty of people to meet. Time for a chat. Maybe with a particular goal in mind? --------------------------------------- . CNN's Rick Martin and Shasta Darlington contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- France confirmed for the first time Saturday that Islamist militant Abdelhamid Abou Zeid was killed amid fighting by French forces in northern Mali late last month. Abou Zeid's death in the Ifoghas Mountains had been widely reported but the French government declined to confirm it pending the results of DNA testing. The death of one of the major figures in al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ""marks an important stage in the struggle against terrorism in the Sahel,"" said a statement from the office of French President Francois Hollande. Report: Al Qaeda kills French hostage held in Mali . Abou Zeid was considered one of the group's most ruthless commanders, having seized at least a dozen foreigners for ransom. The French president's office said there was no new information regarding a second man reported to have been killed in the fighting in northern Mali, jihadist commander, Moktar Belmoktar. DNA testing was also being conducted to confirm his death. Belmoktar is believed to be behind a large scale attack at an Algerian gas plant in January that left dozens of hostages and militants dead. At the beginning of this year, Abou Zeid joined other Islamist forces making a push southward toward the capital, Bamako. But when the Islamist advances prompted a French intervention, he moved to the area around the less accessible city of Kidal, close to the virtually impenetrable Ifoghas Mountains. French minister: 'Tons' of Islamists' heavy weapons found in Mali . French and allied forces, including Malian and Chadian troops, have made significant inroads in recent weeks combating Islamist extremist fighters in Mali. But fighting continues in the remote northeastern part of the West African nation. Nearly 50 aerial sorties were flown in the past few days, most of them in the Ifoghas Mountains region and along the Niger river between Gao and Timbuktu, the French Defense Ministry said Thursday. French ground forces, supported by troops from Chad, have been hunting armed terrorist groups in amongst the valleys of the massif, the ministry said. French involvement in the conflict began on January 11, the day after militants said they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali, and were poised to advance south toward Bamako, the capital. In total, 4,000 French soldiers are deployed in Mali, according to the French Defense Ministry website, alongside 6,300 troops from Chad and the African-led International Support Mission to Mali. Islamist extremists carved out a large haven in northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party MNLA.

"(CNN) -- The unbearable stench of rotting flesh. The search for relatives under heaps of rubble. The desperate pleas for food and water. This is the scene playing out across much of the eastern Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan tore through. Just a few days ago, Tacloban was a bustling city; now, it's a devastated wasteland. How did this happen? Here's a moment-by-moment account of how the typhoon plowed through the Philippines and changed the lives of millions forever. CNN OPEN STORY: Typhoon Haiyan's impact . Anxiety before the storm . Even before Super Typhoon Haiyan struck Friday morning, forecasters warned it might be the strongest storm in recorded history. It was 3.5 times more ferocious than Hurricane Katrina -- and big enough to stretch from Spain to Sweden. More than 700,000 Filipinos heeded warnings and evacuated to Red Cross shelters, Philippine Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon said. But even emergency shelters proved no match for the storm. ""People died there as well,"" Gordon said. The first hit . The deafening winds started howling around 5 a.m. Friday. That's when the super typhoon made landfall in the eastern Philippines. But it wasn't the abysmal 380-kph (235-mph) wind gusts that pulverized Leyte province. It was the epic 5-meter-tall (16-foot-high) wall of ocean water that crushed the city of Tacloban, smashing houses and floating them away. Within seconds, the storm surge ripped children out of their parents' arms and washed them out to sea. Three of Marvin Isanan's daughters -- ages 8, 13 and 15 -- were among those torn away. Isanan and his wife later found the bodies of the two younger girls. ""Only the eldest one is missing,"" Isanan said through tears. ""I hope she's alive."" INTERACTIVE: 'The one building that survived the storm' Deadly debris in the water . Moments after the storm surge came the next danger -- countless hazards in the rushing water, now up to two stories high. Bernadette Tenegra's daughter was impaled by wooden splinters from smashed houses. The mother tried to help, but her daughter insisted she leave her behind, Tenegra said. ""Ma, just let go. Save yourself,"" Tenegra quoted her daughter's last words to the Philippine Daily Inquirer. CNN's Andrew Stevens and Tim Schwarz and a team of storm chasers chronicled Haiyan's wrath from a hotel in Tacloban. But they quickly realized they would have to jump into the water and double as rescue workers to save those on the ground floor. ""The water came up with such alarming speed that it caught these people off guard,"" storm chaser James Reynolds said. He can't shake ""the chilling sound of a woman screaming desperately as she was smashing a window with her hands."" Armed with mattresses, they ferried an elderly woman and a disabled woman across waist-high stormwater. But one of Reynolds' colleagues, Mark Thomas, suffered a massive leg injury when a rusty, jagged piece of sheet metal sliced his shin to the bone from under the water. Apocalyptic scene . As the mammoth flooding began to subside, it left behind a catastrophic scene -- heaps atop of heaps of rubble where people were still trapped. By Saturday, officials found more than 100 bodies scattered on the streets of Tacloban. And that's just one city. The Philippines has thousands of islands. And calculating the damage across all of them -- not to mention getting crucial aid to survivors -- has been greatly hindered by power outages, damaged airports and debris-covered roads. The Philippine Red Cross chairman said Saturday it may be another day or two before aid can arrive in Tacloban. ""It really is an awful, awful situation,"" Gordon said. Desperate for food and water, some residents broke into grocery stores to keep their families alive. Others found themselves suddenly without families. ""Our house got demolished,"" one woman told CNN affiliate ABS-CBN. ""My father died after being hit by falling wooden debris. We are calling for your help. If possible, please bring us food. We don't have anything to eat."" One man said he was still trying to find six family members. ""My child has been buried in that island,"" he said. Pleas for aid . For days, residents decried what they called incredibly slow aid responses -- including by local authorities. But there's a reason for that, Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez said Tuesday. ""We were paralyzed here in the city government,"" the mayor said. ""Out of 300 policemen, only less than 30 were able to make it and showed up. And many are still missing."" Some residents have gone days without food or water. In an act of desperation, many walked hours to the Tacloban airport searching for sustenance and a chance to escape. ""Get international help to come here now -- not tomorrow, now,"" Magina Fernandez said. ""This is really, really, like, bad. Bad. Worse than hell."" The countless dead . No one knows how many people Haiyan killed. By Tuesday, officials had counted 1,774 of the bodies, but say that number may just be scratching the surface. Some say a death toll of 10,000 is entirely possible. ""We have bodies in the water, bodies on the bridges, bodies on the side of the road,"" the Philippine Red Cross chairman said. The Tacloban mayor added that untold numbers of bodies are also hidden under rubble. More concerns ahead . The thick stench of decomposing bodies forced many survivors to cover their faces with towels or shirts. But between grieving the dead and fighting for their own survival, it may be among the least of their worries. But the next concern is sanitation -- and whether those bodies could lead to a wave of disease. Surrounded by rubble, children swarmed around a public well in Tacloban.

"(CNN) -- When President Xi Jinping arrives in Seoul this week, the Chinese leader will have passed over North Korea in favor of its arch rival. Although Beijing remains North Korea's strongest ally, Xi is breaking with tradition by visiting South Korea first, rather than Pyongyang. ""It's clearly a rebuff to Kim Jong Un,"" said David Kang, professor of international relations and business at the University of Southern California, referring to North Korea's leader. Xi is expected to be in South Korea for two days to discuss trade and regional security issues, including North Korea. Trade between the two countries surpassed $270 billion in 2013. And China remains South Korea's main trading partner. Since Xi and President Park took office in their respective countries last year, the two nations have solidified a steady relationship, with several political and economic shared interests. The two have expressed similar concerns about North Korea's nuclear ambitions in particular. Nuclear priority . Both China and South Korea pledged their commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula when the two heads of state met at a nuclear summit in the Netherlands in March. But this increasingly cozy relationship could be a concern for Pyongyang. On Wednesday morning, North Korea launched two short-range rockets off its east coast, according to South Korea. The secretive regime also fired ""projectiles"" into waters off its coast on Sunday and on June 26, prompting speculation about whether North Korea was expressing displeasure with the upcoming meeting between Xi and Park. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said he didn't see any connection with the launches and Xi's upcoming visit, according to Yonhap, South Korea's semi-official news agency. With closer ties between South Korea and China, ""North Korea is worried it can be isolated in northeast Asia,"" said Kim Hankwon, director of the Center for Regional Studies at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. North Korea has begun talks with Japan and struck economic deals with Russia which could indicate that Kim Jong Un is trying to ""reduce dependency on China,"" he added. Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions have tested China's patience at times. ""Most North Korean provocations hurt China's military and security interests,"" said Kim. ""The U.S. has increased its military and security influence over northeast Asia -- their rationale was North Korea's nuclear threats."" This has brought more U.S. involvement in east Asia, much to China's chagrin. Despite Beijing's disagreements with North Korea, there may not be much change in their decades-long alliance, Kim added. ""China is angry at North Korea's military provocation. That does not mean that China has changed its strategy towards North Korea."" Beijing tries to strike a balanced relationship with the Koreas, talking to the South about economic issues and the North about political topics,"" Kim said. Common ground . Apart from the issue of North Korea, China and South Korea have bonded through their distrust of Japan. ""China and South Korea share a number of issues concerning Japan including the comfort women, and the announcement of [Japan's Prime Minister] Abe reinterpreting the constitution,"" said Kang, director of Korean Studies Institute at USC. On Tuesday, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe confirmed the ""reinterpretation"" of the country's pacifist postwar constitution, which will allow the Japanese military to assist in conflicts overseas. Both China and South Korea issued predictably chilly responses to the announcement. The two countries bitterly disagree with the way Japan has addressed its military past, especially over the issue of so-called comfort women, who were forced into sexual slavery by Japan's imperial forces before and during World War II. Both countries are also involved in territorial disputes with Japan over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands and Dokdo/Takeshima islands. North Korea fires two short-range rockets into sea .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Members of Iran's national soccer team wore green arm and wrist bands Wednesday during their World Cup qualifying match against South Korea. Members of Iran's National Soccer Team sport green bands in their game against South Korea on Wednesday. The team does not normally wear green bands. Many Iranians are viewing the team's bands as a sign of support for Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi, although that has not been confirmed. Green is the campaign color of Moussavi and has been widely worn by his supporters who have staged massive rallies in Tehran before and after last week's presidential election. Moussavi is disputing the results of the vote that gave President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term and is calling for a new election. The players took the wrist bands off when the team came out for the second half of the game that was taking place in Seoul, South Korea. It is unclear whether the players were asked to remove the wrist bands. The match ended 1-1.","Many Iranians viewing team's bands as a sign of support for opposition leader .

"Sevaré, Mali (CNN) -- The town of Niafunke, on the banks of the River Niger, was made famous by the legendary Ali Farka Toure, one of a legion of great guitarists to emerge from Mali. But nowadays, Niafunke is known as a battleground as Mali disintegrates and a mix of hard-line Salafi Islamists and ethnic Tuareg rebels tighten their grip on the northern two-thirds of the country. Malik, an English teacher from the town, knows just how hard-line the new arrivals are. He said a friend was brutally beaten on a Niafunke street after Salafists caught him with a flask of alcohol in his pocket. Malik also enjoys beer, a cigarette and music -- all ""vices"" abhorred by the Salafists of a movement known as Ansar Dine -- so he fled. His story is all too typical. Mali, traditionally a tolerant society, has become bitterly divided in the wake of a rebellion by the Tuareg, a nomadic people who inhabit the north of this country as well as areas of Niger, Libya, Burkina Faso and Algeria. Niafunke was one of the initial towns the Tuareg attacked in January, sparking a coup by disgruntled Malian soldiers. The soldiers, running low on ammunition and food in the face of rapid rebel advances, abandoned their northern bases en masse. They felt that political elites in the far-off capital of Bamako had virtually abandoned them. Into the chaos has stepped Ansar Dine, a Tuareg-led Islamist militant group whose primary objective is to impose sharia law in Mali, and an exodus of well-armed Tuareg from Libya, where many fought for Moammar Gadhafi. No longer welcome in post-Gadhafi Libya, these battle-hardened Tuareg fighters traversed Saharan pistes to return to their homeland in northern Mali, which is known as Azawad in their indigenous language. Gadhafi's spy chief goes on trial in Libya . The separatist National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, or MNLA, formally declared its independence from Mali in April, and last month it announced that had joined forces with Ansar Dine. The MNLA cooled to this alliance when the two could not agree on how it would share power, but Mali, one of Africa's poorest countries, is now in a state of protracted limbo. And it's this uncertainty -- this messy, unpredictable war in a country known as Africa's crossroads -- that threatens the region and has created concern that northern Mali could become a new terrorist haven. Stalemate of suspicion . Nearly 400 miles northeast of Bamako, along a winding, dusty highway dotted with spartan roadside villages, is the town of Sevaré. Malian security forces have erected a series of checkpoints around the town that amount to internal border crossings. To travel farther north, toward rebel-held territory, invites extreme suspicion. Those on ancient, creaking buses bound for Gao or Timbuktu have their belongings meticulously pulled apart by cautious local police. At Sevaré's southern edge, passengers queue up in the stifling midday heat at a garbage-strewn checkpoint to press their case for heading into rebel-held lands. There is scant sympathy for their plight. After passing through the city, they are then subject to another checkpoint on its northern fringe. Beyond Sevaré is the town of Konna, on the banks of the Niger. It is supposedly held by a dispirited mix of Malian troops, gendarmes, national guard and police. It is the last population center claimed to be in government hands. But Muhammed, a young Tuareg employed by a British nongovernmental organization, described Bamako's hold on Konna as more tenuous than the central government was admitting. Douentza, 75 miles away, is now in the hands of the MNLA. The famed city of Timbuktu, not so long ago a popular tourist destination for adventurous Europeans, is now ruled by Ansar Dine. MNLA forces are more prevalent in Azawad's southern hinterlands, while the better-funded, better-equipped Ansar Dine is primarily in control of the cities. The Salafists have closed bars, attempted to ban smoking and forced women to wear veils in a bid to implement gender segregation. Mousa, a multilingual art dealer from Timbuktu who has spent considerable time in the United States hawking the work of local Malian artisans, made a hurried departure well before the rebel takeover. He went from doing a roaring trade with Western tourists to becoming an internal refugee in a matter of months. ""I left before the rebels entered the city,"" he said. ""After hearing about their attacks in the (far) north, I knew they would come (to Timbuktu)."" He now lives in uncertainty in a town near Sevaré. Not all Tuaregs back the cause of an independent Azawad. Zeidan ag Sidi Lamine, a former rebel now living in Bamako and part of the Malian government, said talks with the rebels were possible if it would accept the country's territorial integrity. He said Ansar Dine and the MNLA must accept ""that tolerance of religious difference is non-negotiable, and the nation's diversity must be preserved,"" respectively. When asked whether he would he would be willing to take part in peace talks with either group, Sidi Lamine instantly responded, ""Of course I would accept."" But he believes that the self-declared ""Islamic State of Azawad"" is destined to unravel for two reasons: because the more nationalist MNLA did not consult the local population before declaring independence, and because it would be impossible for Ansar Dine to enforce sharia law over the long term due to Mali's inherent diversity. Mousa, the art dealer, says that the revolt was partly motivated by another important factor and that it would not be easily undone. ""It is racism, plain and simple,"" he said. ""The Tuaregs do not want to be ruled by Bambaras, Fulanis or Songhais,"" three of Mali's principal peoples. The reality driving this Tuareg revolt is more likely a complex hybrid of several factors, including ethnic nationalism, political isolation and a lack of economic opportunity. On top of that is the austere brand of Islam being espoused by Ansar Dine. The military stalemate is compounded by political paralysis. Amadou Sanogo, the army captain who overthrew President Amadou Toumani Touré in March, had pledged to retake the embattled north. He has since technically stepped aside in favor of interim President Dioncounda Traore. Traore, however, is in a Paris hotel after being beaten unconscious in a May 21 attack that occurred in the presidential palace. In Traore's absence, Mali is being effectively led by interim Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra, a former NASA engineer who holds U.S. citizenship. Diarra has hinted at trying to push the rebels back, and there are reports of troops being mobilized from southern garrisons to Sevaré, which could serve as a launch pad for a counterinsurgency campaign. But the town's threadbare garrisons suggest the army and gendarmerie would be ill-prepared to take the offensive. Only a handful of armored personal carriers and technical fighting trucks were evident. Most soldiers and gendarmes buzz around town on motor scooters more suited to running errands than fighting a war. A magnet for jihadists . For the United States, the collapse of Mali poses multiple headaches beyond the humanitarian crisis that many have been striving to prevent. Its counterterrorism program here is in abeyance, just as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, and other freelance jihadists expand their presence. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has made millions of dollars through ransom payments for Western hostages. This money is thought to have been spent on a more sophisticated arsenal that may, according to some Western intelligence estimates, include ground-to-air missiles looted from Gadhafi's arsenals. While specifics regarding this more sophisticated weaponry remains speculative for the time being due to a dearth of verifiable intelligence in the Azawad region, what is known is that this sprawling, ungoverned area is becoming a magnet for regional and even transnational jihadists, according to several witnesses. Basically, Mali remains in political freefall while quarrelsome rebels attempt to consolidate their control over an area the nearly the size of Texas. After early efforts regarding a possible military intervention were rebuffed by Sanogo's junta, the West African regional body ECOWAS is taking the issue to the U.N. Security Council. Mahamadou Issoufou, the president of neighboring Niger -- a nation long plagued by its own Tuareg revolts -- has been sounding the alarm bell on the looming danger of jihadists controlling territory in Mali. Jean Ping, the chairman of the African Union, also plans to raise the Azawad issue at the U.N. in coming days. It's a situation that the late guitarist Toure, whose album ""Talking Timbuktu"" won a Grammy, would not recognize. ""For some, Timbuktu is a place at the end of nowhere,"" he once said. ""But that's not true. I'm from Timbuktu, and I can tell you that it's right in the center of the world.""

"(CNN) -- Rick Perry's announcement that he won't run for an unprecedented fourth term as Texas governor next year increases already rampant speculation that he'll launch another bid for the White House in 2016. Considering how the Republican's 2012 campaign faltered, there's plenty of skepticism about the viability of a possible second presidential run. Perry: 2016 'certainly an option' The longest-serving governor in Texas history didn't reveal much about his political future as he announced on Monday that he wouldn't seek re-election. ""I will also pray and reflect and work to determine my own future path,"" Perry told friends and supporters at an event in San Antonio. He added that ""any future considerations I will announce in due time and I will arrive at that decision appropriately."" Advisers hint at future as Perry exits as governor . CNN National Political Correspondent Jim Acosta asked Perry after the event about his plans for time off. ""No time off, man,"" Perry replied. He acknowledged on Fox News Sunday -- the day before his announcement -- that he is keeping his eye on the next presidential campaign calendar, saying that is ""certainly, that's an option."" Perry advisers also are not shooting down suggestions that the governor is aiming for the Oval Office. The ill-fated 2012 run is the only black mark on a successful 30-year career in politics. Can Perry overcome his last presidential run? He officially jumped into the race the previous August, later than the rest of the Republican field and announced his candidacy the same day of the GOP's Iowa straw poll in Ames, won by Rep. Michele Bachmann. The best days of his campaign were the first ones, when he quickly topped polls for the Republican nomination. But the effort soon swooned due to weak debate performances and gaffes. Perrry's most damaging episode was the ""oops"" moment at a Michigan debate when he couldn't remember the third federal agency he pledged to eliminate if elected president. ""He was supposed to be the conservative coming in from Texas, the new Ronald Reagan. He bombed in the debates, and I'm being kind when I say he bombed in the debates,"" said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. Perry continued to fade and posted distant finishes in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. He suspended his bid in mid-January, prior to the South Carolina primary. If Perry couldn't handle competitors like Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and other candidates in what was considered a weak Republican field last time out, would he fare any better in 2016? The roster could be stronger if Republican stars like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker jump in. But if he runs, Perry would presumably enter the race at a much earlier date and wouldn't be fighting high expectations, which were placed on his candidacy from the start last time. He can also cite history. ""I would remind you of this: Ronald Reagan ran more than once; John McCain ran more than once to get the nomination, Mitt Romney ran more than once to get the nomination. There's still a conservative base of the Republican Party that likes Rick Perry,"" King said. ""Would he need to do a hell of a lot better if he ran again? Yes. But should you rule it out completely? No."" Republican strategist and CNN contributor Kevin Madden also said experience matters. ""There's nothing that helps a candidate run and win a nomination like the experience of having run and lost a nomination. The benefit of experience for candidates that have gone through the brutality of the process is a crucial advantage. That knowledge of what went right and what didn't could serve Rick Perry well this time around,"" said Madden. Madden was a top adviser and spokesman in Romney's unsuccessful bid for the 2008 GOP nomination, and the 2012 edition, in which Romney captured the nomination before losing the President Barack Obama last November. He said Romney's campaign leadership took Perry seriously since he could raise money and would make a splash entering a fluid competition for the nomination. ""But he was destined to fade. The entire campaign had the feeling of being thrown together at the last minute. You simply cannot just waltz into a presidential campaign and win without painstakingly planning it out well in advance,"" Madden said. If Perry runs again, his first big test with Republican voters would be in Iowa, where the caucuses traditionally kick off the presidential nominating calendar for voters. Matt Strawn knows something about Iowa politics. He served as the state's Republican party chairman in the last presidential cycle. ""With a wide open GOP nomination contest and an unsettled a GOP electorate, it would be foolish to write off a candidate with Governor Perry's record of economic success,"" Strawn told CNN. ""Americans love a comeback story. And a successful Perry presidential campaign would certainly be that,"" added Strawn.","Longest-serving Texas governor announced this week he would not seek re-election .

"(EW.com) -- There is a reason that Lois Lowry's 1993 book won the prestigious Newbery Medal and inspired millions of readers—as well as other dystopian YA best-sellers like The Hunger Games: It features children asking important questions and challenging draconian authority. But there also might be a good reason that the novel—which imagines a (literally) colorless, thought-controlled society that has banished memory of the past—took so long to finally come to the screen. Brenton Thwaites (Maleficent's Prince Phillip) plays Jonas, a young man who sees flickers of color in the dreary Brave New World of sameness around him. Because of his gift, he's chosen to be the next Receiver of Memories, the one person who bears all the pain—and pleasure—of humanity's past so that the government's status quo can be preserved. Unfortunately, his apprenticeship under the outgoing Receiver, a.k.a., the Giver (Jeff Bridges), is built upon cerebral gobbledygook that the screenplay and director Phillip Noyce never quite find a way to package visually. Instead, we get flashes of life's beauty and man's cruelty, and when desperate, more and more underlined dialogue about the power of human emotions and the shackles of sameness. Bridges, who spent nearly 20 years trying to bring the novel to the screen, seems trapped playing the passive seer, and Meryl Streep's villainous turn as the Jane Campion-haired Chief Elder will test the blind devotion of Golden Globe voters. In the end, the film practically collapses under its own...hmm, what's the opposite of 'weight'? In any case, it falls apart with a slapdash final act that doesn't work as drama or action and only serves to undermine Jonas's heroics. It's treated as a quest so non-Herculean that you wonder why the Giver didn't do the job himself years ago. Maybe he just lost interest too. EW Grade: C- . See the original story at EW.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- They're not exactly gym buddies, but a personal trainer in Poland can now say he worked out with the President of the United States. Jean Ekwa was at the Marriott gym with Barack Obama in Warsaw and confessed to some eavesdropping in an interview with CNN's Brooke Baldwin. Someone in the hotel workout room captured every grunt and stretch of Obama's routine, then leaked the video on Wednesday. Ekwa said Obama was lifting 25-pound free weights. ""As for the technique, I can't honestly say that it's perfect,"" Ekwa, a personal trainer, said. Ekwa noted that everyone present in the gym had been scanned by the Secret Service. He said when he first saw the roughly 10 agents at the gym, he didn't think he would be allowed in. ""All the people there tried to play it cool,"" he said. ""On the inside I was very excited. I didn't want to do anything that would end up with security guards breaking my arm or something."" While Ekwa couldn't give Obama top marks, fitness guru Tony Horton called his form ""pretty good."" ""I'd give him a solid B-plus, maybe an A-minus,"" Horton, creator of the P90X workout, said Thursday on CNN's New Day. Horton, whose workout has been adopted by Republican Reps. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Aaron Schock of Illinois, advised Obama to ""breathe a little bit more."" But said he was glad Obama decided to hit the gym while abroad. ""I'm just thrilled that our President shows up to Poland and ends up doing a workout for a half an hour before going to bed instead of grabbing a Scotch and a cigarette,"" Horton said. Comments online ran the gamut, as some Twitter users knocked the weight of the President's dumbbells while others cheered him for staying active. Gawker, meanwhile, published a list of Obama's biggest workout mistakes: from ""wearing long pants"" to not lunging far enough during his exercise. The viral website even called him out for using the elliptical machine. Horton instead focused on the importance of the President's commitment to fitness, which he said helps keep his mind sharp. First lady Michelle Obama has pushed Americans to get in shape and is working to end childhood obesity by encouraging kids to get active through her ""Let's Move"" campaign, which she launched in 2010. Setback for first lady in food fight with Congress . The candid video might have caught Obama off guard, but likely not unaware, former White House videographer Arun Chaudhary said. It shows Obama calmly perusing the rack of free weights, which he used to lunge and lift and perform an intense set of curls. ""President Obama is somebody who just acts the same on and off camera and has this unique ability just to sort of not care about it,"" Chaudhary said. ""He is very aware that everybody in that gym has a cell phone and that they're probably taking a video."" Chaudhary backed up the Secret Service's claims that Obama was safe, assuring that all hotel guests were without a doubt screened by the President's security detail. ""I think it's unusual for us to see the President working out in a gym, but as a security level it's not different than him getting pancakes at a diner in Iowa,"" he said. ""For me, this gym tape is almost ... no different than (White House photographer) Pete Souza's photo of the first lady and the President touching heads in the freight elevator on Inauguration Day,"" Chaudhary said. The video does show a lanky Obama in a different light than his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, who has been photographed shirtless hunting, fishing and riding horseback. ""This is not him strangling a tiger on top of a horse while he's shirtless,"" Chaudhary said of Obama. ""This is someone doing what they do in a non-glamorous way.""","Jean Ekwa worked out alongside President Obama in Poland and said he was lifting 26-pound weights .

"(CNN) -- Concluding its investigation into the unintended anthrax exposure at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the CDC says it has found another more ""distressing"" problem due to lab workers not following protocol. The CDC held a news conference to discuss the conclusion of its investigation Friday. It determined that while it is ""not impossible"" that the staff was exposed to viable B. anthracis (anthrax), it is ""extremely unlikely"" that this happened. The lab workers' health is being monitored, and they were given antibiotics as a precaution. No one who may have been exposed has gotten sick. The incident was discovered on June 13. The CDC report says the potential exposure happened between June 6 and June 13. A lab that had been preparing the anthrax samples for use in two other labs on the CDC's Atlanta campus ""may not have adequately inactivated the samples."" That means the other labs were working with samples thought to be harmless; therefore, workers didn't wear protective equipment they would otherwise have been using when handling such infectious material. Procedures in two of the three labs may have exposed workers to the anthrax, the CDC said. Hallway and lab areas have since been decontaminated. The leader of one of the labs was reassigned shortly after the incident was revealed. CDC spokesman Tom Skinner would not confirm the name of the person who was reassigned. There are three types of anthrax infection: cutaneous (through the skin), inhalation (through the lungs) and gastrointestinal (through digestion). According to the report, the exposure happened because the lab that was handling the dangerous material initially didn't use an approved sterilization technique. It didn't have a written plan reviewed by senior staff to make sure all safety protocols were followed, and there was a limited knowledge of peer-reviewed literature about the process that would make it less dangerous. The lab also did not have a standard operating procedure that would make sure the transfer of the material would be safe. Bottom line, ""the scientists failed to follow a scientifically derived and reviewed protocol that would have assured the anthrax was deactivated,"" according to CDC Director Tom Frieden. It ""should have happened, and it didn't."" During the investigation ""multiple other problems were found,"" according to Frieden. What to know about anthrax . Investigators found another troubling case that involved a dangerous transfer of material. This happened six weeks ago. But what's ""most distressing,"" according to Frieden, is that he had found out about it ""less than 48 hours ago."" In this case, a culture of nonpathogenic avian influenza, meaning a type of the flu that is not that dangerous, was unintentionally cross-contaminated with a potentially deadly kind of flu -- the highly pathogenic H5N1. This strain has killed millions of birds and infected over 600 people over the last decade. In the case of this contamination, the CDC says none of the lab workers were exposed to the dangerous virus. It was, however, shipped to a lab run by the United States Department of Agriculture. The CDC has closed the labs that were involved in the incidents. The lab where the flu contamination occurred won't reopen until the lab puts better safety procedures in place, Frieden says. The lab involved in the anthrax incident will remain closed for such dangerous microbes until Frieden personally approves its reopening under conditions that prevent any such mishap from happening again, Frieden said. The CDC has also stopped moving any biological material out of its two highest-level labs while their procedures are being reevaluated. As a result of these problems, the CDC has created a high-level group of leaders who will work on lab safety issues. It has also started putting together an external advisory group to take a closer look at lab safety. And the CDC is carefully reviewing all the other procedures for labs working with dangerous pathogens, and it has put together a rapid-response command structure to hopefully help the labs avoid future incidents. ""I will say that I'm just astonished that this could have happened here,"" Frieden said. He stands by his labs, which are considered some of the best in the world, and he stands by his scientists. But he added that he is ""upset,"" ""angry"" and has lost sleep over the incidents, and he is ""working around the clock"" to make sure it never happens again.

"Doha, Qatar (CNN) -- When the CEO of a major international airline says that half of the passengers on his planes are ""uncomfortable,"" you might think the carrier in question had a major PR disaster on its hands. But what Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of Air France-KLM apparently meant by ""uncomfortable"" was more of the Gallic, philosophical variety; that people are just unsettled when they sit on his planes and not even an extra few inches of legroom can placate their metaphysical disquiet. ""If I give them more space, they will probably be happier, but it will not change their uncomfortable feeling because they are not comfortable in the air,"" he said, talking to CNN's Richard Quest at the recent International Air Transport Association (IATA) AGM in Doha, Qatar. Many flying economy class on any airline however might think de Juniac is spot on; that flying is just an uncomfortable, cramped experience and the worst part of travel today. That sentiment is borne out in some recent research by U.S. PR firm Ketchum. It ranked the public reputation of the airline industry in the United States as only just above banking, the government and the tobacco business in terms of positivity: 42% of people had a negative view of airlines, while 61% had a positive perception of the travel and tourism business. In the hyper-competitive world of airlines, some have better reputations than others, be that through the power of the brand or genuine, good customer experiences. For Air New Zealand -- a company that has helped to boost its image by using hobbits and cabin crew in body paint in its in-flight safety videos -- passengers cannot be thought of enough by airlines. ""The industry is not customer-focused, we're too fixated on operations,"" said Christopher Luxon the airline's CEO. ""We do have things to mitigate long-haul travel, like our skycouches, but we do have (as an industry) a pretty low innovation rate."" Many of the in-flight innovations are of the variety that make headlines and feed into the aspirational nature of flying, such as new first class cabins. But these are a long way from what the majority of fliers will experience. And for de Juniac the experience is key and currently lacking. From the moment a ticket is booked on a website all the way through to the moment the passenger arrives at their destination, it needs to be improved, he believes-- even if some things are out of an airline's control, such as long immigration queues and poorly equipped airports. ""The experience of travel is from 'home to home,'"" he said. ""We (as an industry) need to do better."" However some question whether or not the industry as a whole needs to do better to collectively to boost its image. ""The reputation of airlines in America are particularly bad, but elsewhere in the world it's seen as pretty good because it is still aspirational to fly,"" said Rowena Olegario, senior research fellow at Oxford University. She also noted how hard it could be for many airlines and those in the aviation business to rally together to boost the idea of flying if many within it lament the experience themselves. ""(They) should be the champions of the industry but what I've been struck by (while at the IATA AGM) was how they complain about flying,"" said Olegario. In that respect, there is at least some egalite between those squashed in economy class and some of those who sit towards the front of the planes running the airlines.","Airlines only just more popular than banks, says survey .
Industry figures admit airlines must do more to create better travel experience .
""The industry is not customer focused,"" says Air New Zealand CEO ."

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has banned dishes containing delicacies like shark fin and and bird's nest from official banquets as part of a government crackdown on official extravagance. Chinese authorities published new regulations that ""explicitly ruled out dishes containing shark fins, bird nests and wild animal products in official reception dinners,"" the official Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday. Xinhua also said that cigarettes and up-market liquors are not allowed to be served at official dinners and officials below provincial level should not stay in hotel suites on business trips. The new rules aim to ""regulate the use of public funding on receptions,"" Xinhua added. President Xi Jinping has made tackling official corruption a priority since taking power earlier this year. In September, the government announced that officials would not be able to use public money to send mooncakes as gifts - a traditional part of China's Mid Autumn Festival celebrations. Some hotels in Hong Kong and China have also removed shark's fin soup from their menus and airlines like, Cathay Pacific, have banned the product from cargo holds. Up to 73 million sharks are estimated to be killed each year, according to a 2006 academic study quoted on the website of campaign group Hong Kong Shark Foundation. Their carcasses are usually discarded and campaigners say the practice is wasteful and cruel. Shark's fin soup is widely served in restaurants in Chinese communities worldwide and is a dish often served at weddings to mark the importance of the occasion and impress the couple's extended families and friends.

"(CNN) -- Alex Rodriguez's fight against his 211-game suspension by Major League Baseball has officially begun. The Major League Baseball Players Association on Wednesday filed a grievance on his behalf, appealing the suspension that MLB levied two days earlier after an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs, association spokesman Greg Bouris said. The New York Yankees third baseman can play while the suspension, which was to take effect Thursday, is appealed. He has been in the Yankees' lineup since returning from injury Monday, and went 1-for-5 at the plate Wednesday night in a 6-5 loss to the White Sox in Chicago. A-Rod: 'I'm fighting for my life' MLB on Monday suspended Rodriguez and 12 other players, accusing them of having ties to the now-shuttered Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in South Florida and taking performance-enhancing drugs. Rodriguez, 38, has denied the accusation. He received the longest suspension of the 13 players: 211 regular-season games, which would have seen him sit through the 2014 season. The 12 other players accepted 50-game suspensions without pay. Opinion: How A-Rod let us down . Speaking to reporters Monday, Rodriguez declined to answer questions about whether he had used performance-enhancing drugs. ""I think we'll have a forum to discuss all of that, and we'll talk about it then,"" he said. The league said Rodriguez's punishment is based on his alleged use and possession of banned performance-enhancing substances, including testosterone and human growth hormone, for multiple years. Officials also accuse him of ""engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct or frustrate"" their investigation into the matter. Rodriguez is considered one of the game's greatest sluggers. He has 647 home runs -- the fifth most ever -- in 19 seasons. He holds the largest contract ever in American sports, signing with the Yankees in 2007 for $275 million over 10 years.

"(TIME.com) -- Did you have a nasty case of food poisoning this year? Chances are that fruit or vegetables were the culprit. Every year, one in six Americans gets sick from food, 128,000 people are ill enough to go to the hospital for their symptoms, which typically include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Major food recalls and reports of food-related illness seem to be a monthly, if not weekly occurrence, with a bout of illness from contaminated ground beef reported just this week. Over the last three days, Whole Foods Market recalled batches of its Whole Catch Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon, and Sprouters Northwest of Kent, Washington, recalled 1953 pounds of alfalfa, clover, brocco sandwich sprouts, and spicy sprouts due to potential contamination with Listeria. Taking a closer look at the problem, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a comprehensive report detailing the common sources of foodborne illness in the United States from the years 1998 through 2008. The largest culprit? Leafy greens. Based on data from nearly 4,600 outbreaks of food illness, researchers estimated the number of cases attributable to 17 different food categories and found that produce accounted for 46% of cases. Leafy vegetables such as spinach and cabbage were responsible for the majority of the illnesses, and most were caused by norovirus, which is spread to produce from water contaminated by fecal matter. TIME.com: FDA proposes major regulations for food safety . Although contaminated meat and poultry triggered fewer illnesses, they accounted for the most deaths -- at 19% -- from listeria and salmonella infections. In the last ten years, there have been three major listeria outbreaks linked to sliced processed turkey, and salmonella was responsible for the most recent sickness among several people who consumed kibbeh, a Middle Eastern dish with raw meat, from a restaurant in Detroit. Despite the findings, the CDC says that people shouldn't avoid eating fruit and veggies. ""When properly cleaned, separated, cooked, and stored to limit contamination, fruits and vegetables safely provide some essential nutrients that would otherwise be lacking in most American diets,"" the report authors write. The goal of the report, in fact, isn't to scare consumers but to aid regulatory agencies in their efforts to prevent contamination and improve food safety. Although the report doesn't pinpoint where along the production chain food gets contaminated, the CDC says its previous research found most infections are caused by norovirus that is spread by sick food handlers. In a report on foodborne norovirus outbreaks during 2001 to 2008, the CDC found over 80% of outbreaks were associated with food prepared in commercial settings like restaurants, delis, or catering businesses. TIME.com: Illnesses from imported foods on the rise . Health officials hope the timing of the report brings more attention to needed changes in how food is handled and processed in the United States. The CDC's report follows the Food and Drug Administration's recently released food safety rule proposals earlier this month. The FDA released two major requirements for improving food safety for public commentary, and will be holding a public meeting on the rules at the end of February. The draft proposals -- the first in 70 years -- will allow the FDA to take on a preventative rather than reactive role in dealing with food contamination. One of the rules focuses specifically on produce, which the CDC found is the main cause of foodborne illness in the United States. The FDA proposal will require strict standards for growing, harvesting, packing and holding fruits and vegetables as well as increase sanitation for irrigating fields and washing produce and strengthen rules for maintaining worker hygiene. It will also increase surveillance for materials used in soils like fertilizers and manure, provide better management of animals that enter crop fields, and improve cleanliness of processing equipment.

"(CNN) -- The CEO of pizza giant Papa John's has apologized to a Sanford, Florida, customer after a delivery man accidentally dialed the customer and left a racist rant on the man's voice mail. The apology came after a customer posted on YouTube a video of the voice mail message, which featured the delivery man using racial slurs as he complained to another Papa John's employee about the size of tips he receives from African-Americans. The customer, who is not identified and is not shown on camera, shows the receipt for $15.26 and said he gave the delivery man a $5 tip -- more than 20% -- on Sunday. Then the customer plays the roughly four-minute message. ""I guess that's the only requirement for being a (n-word) in Sanford,"" the driver told a colleague. ""... Yeah, they give me five bucks there -- fine outstanding African-American gentleman of the community."" The driver's colleague can be heard laughing. During the message, the delivery man can be heard singing the racial slur repeatedly. The video went viral, generating an outcry on social media. Papa John's CEO John Schnatter took to social media, posting an apology on Facebook and Twitter for ""the reprehensible language used by two former employees."" ""Their thinking and actions defy both my personal and the company's values and everything for which this company stands. The employees responsible for this absolutely unacceptable behavior were immediately terminated,"" Schnatter wrote on Monday. ""My heartfelt apology goes out to the customer involved, his family, and our community at large. I am very sorry that anyone would be exposed to these hurtful and painful words by any person involved in any way with our company."" Schnatter said he also personally reached out to the customer to ""share my own thoughts and offer my deepest apology."" The incident came as Sanford remains in the national spotlight because of the 2012 shooting death of an unarmed black teenager. The shooting raised questions about race relations and sparked large protest in Sanford after police declined to arrest George Zimmerman, who said he shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in self-defense. Zimmerman goes to trial next month on a charge of second-degree murder in connection with the killing. In 2012: Papa John's apologizes for receipt's racial slur . CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- As I waited in the cafe at Lifetime Athletics in Atlanta, the sound of laughter filtered through the front door. It was just past 8 a.m. on a Friday, and the CNN Fit Nation team was already having a good time. ""Our team came together quickly,"" Ron Cothran said later. ""By the end of the morning it seemed as if we had all known each other for years."" Every year CNN selects six iReporters to race in a triathlon with Dr. Sanjay Gupta and the Fit Nation team. We give them a road bike (with all the necessary accessories), a wet suit and a gym membership to help them prepare for the Nautica Malibu Triathlon on September 14. As they train for their first triathlon with support from our fitness and nutrition coaches, they blog, tweet and share their workouts online. CNN readers follow along as the team gets ready to swim a half-mile in the ocean, bike 18 miles and run 4 miles along the Pacific coast. 6 people who will inspire you this year . That Friday morning was the start of the team's second day at Kick-off Weekend, where they met each other, their coaches and the CNN Medical Unit for the first time. ""After a couple of sessions with April, our coach, any fear and uncertainty that I had prior to arriving in Atlanta had gone away,"" Cothran said. ""That weekend solidified in my mind... the plan that is being laid out for me and my team will be more than sufficient to make us successful."" Their confidence was evident as the Fit Nation team ordered breakfast -- veggie egg white omelets or a protein smoothie -- and headed down the hall to a nutrition lecture. As they settled in, the friendly banter continued. For the past few years, the Fit Nation team has been called the ""6-Pack."" This year they're branding themselves a little differently. ""We came up with the name 'Sassy Six' as our team name because we all have a little sassiness inside of us,"" says Sia Figiel. ""That compelled us to believe in ourselves enough to submit that video -- even though we'd all been beaten by our struggles with weight and health and other emotional issues (before)."" Figiel knows these struggles well. The Samoan woman once weighed nearly 400 pounds. When she developed type 2 diabetes, she decided enough was enough and has since lost 100 pounds. Each member of the team has a different story to tell. But they all have the same goal: to learn how to live a healthier lifestyle, and to inspire others to do the same. ""A journey to wellness can be long and lonely when done individually,"" Connie Sievers says. ""I have started the journey to wellness before, but when I was confronted with stress I reverted back to my unhealthy habits. (Now) the power of the entire CNN Fit Nation team will be there to hold me accountable, encourage me, pick me up and put me on the right track again."" Sievers will find strength in Mike Wilber, who is taking advantage of this opportunity to no longer be ""the guy who wanted to do things but physically couldn't."" Wilber will be inspired by Karen Manns, who wants to lose 50 pounds by the time September rolls around. And all will try to inspire friends and family at home. ""What does Fit Nation mean to me? It means responsibility to my fellow 'Sassy Six' team members, friends, family and supporters all over the world,"" Wilber says. ""My story is reaching a global audience, which is amazing to think about. I cannot let the people who are supporting me down."" ""I know now that I am not alone,"" Fiegel adds. ""That I am supported and encouraged. And I wish to be that for anyone out there who is reading this and has lost hope and is considering giving up."" During Kick-off Weekend, the team underwent several physical fitness tests, spoke with Gupta about their goals, and climbed Stone Mountain just outside of Atlanta. They left the city Sunday ready to start their training. ""We have a long hard road ahead of us, but the camaraderie we have is undeniable and confidence we have in our abilities as a team is growing,"" Jamil Nathoo said. ""Together, we know we can do this.""","The Fit Nation team has named themselves the ""Sassy Six""

"(CNN) -- A diet of bread and water is the punishment for dozens of Arizona inmates who allegedly defaced American flags placed in their jail cells. The 38 male inmates are part of the Maricopa County jail system, which is under the control of controversial sheriff Joe Arpaio. For their alleged unpatriotic acts, the sheriff said Thursday, they'll survive on bread and water for seven days. ""These inmates have destroyed the American flag that was placed in their cells,"" Arpaio said. ""Tearing them, writing on them, stepping on them, throwing them in the toilet, trash or wherever they feel. It's a disgrace ... this is government property that they are destroying, and we will take action against those who act this way."" The flags are part of a push for patriotism in county jail cells that includes listening to the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" every morning and ""God Bless America"" every night over the intercom system. Arpaio implemented the American flag jailhouse initiative in November. At the time, he announced a push to hire more veterans, saying his office employs more than 600 men and women who have served in the military. He manages about 8,000 inmates. ""Sheriff Arpaio is a Korean War veteran and a big patriot,"" said Chrisopher Hegstrom, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Office. Arpaio's tough, headline-grabbing punishments have earned him diehard supporters and fiery opponents along the way. He's issued pink underwear to the men detained in the county's jails and said he is saving taxpayers money by removing salt and pepper from prison meals. This month, the county announced that his racial and ethnic profiling will cost it at least $22 million. A court ruled in May that his office routinely profiled Latinos during traffic and immigration patrols. His office has a history of targeting vehicles with occupants of Latino heritage, scrutinizing them more strictly and detaining them more often, U.S. District Judge Murray Snow ruled. Arpaio has denied any discrimination or civil rights violations, and is appealing the decision. He was elected to his sixth term as sheriff for the Phoenix area in November 2012.

"Washington (CNN) -- An estimated 25 million passengers will fly over the 12-day Thanksgiving travel period, peaking on Sunday, December 1, when 2.56 million are expected to fly, according to Airlines for America, an industry trade group. All told, Thanksgiving air travel is expected to increase by 1.5% over last year, the association said. The high-volume period begins Friday, November 22, and goes through Tuesday, December 3. A4A Vice President John Heimlich said airlines are adding seats to accommodate the holiday demand, and planes are expected to be more than 85% full on the busiest days. Other peak holiday travel days will be Wednesday, November 27, with a predicted 2.42 million passengers, and Sunday, December 1, with 2.56 million fliers. Thanksgiving Day is November 28. The A4A has characterized 2013 as a year in which the airlines' ""razor thin"" results have become ""paper thin."" During the first nine months of 2013, the 10 largest U.S. carriers reported net earnings of $4.5 billion, resulting in a net profit margin of 4% -- up from $312 million, or 0.3%, in 2012.

"Jindo, South Korea (CNN) -- A passenger describes women screaming in the darkness. A father learns his child is trapped. A son, fearing death, tells his mother he loves her. Investigators haven't said what caused a South Korean ferry boat carrying hundreds of passengers to capsize on Wednesday. But as rescuers searched frigid waters for nearly 300 missing people, text messages purporting to be from missing passengers surfaced, describing the harrowing moments after the ferry started to roll. CNN affiliate YTN reported on several messages, purportedly from passengers aboard the sinking vessel to their loved ones. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the messages or when they were sent. It's also unclear what happened to the people who sent them. On Thursday, the semi-official Yonhap News Agency reported that police now believe the messages supposedly sent after the ferry sank were fake. Yonhap cited the Cyber Terror Response Center of the National Police Agency as saying that investigators had checked the cell phone records of missing passengers and found none had made any calls or texts after the ferry sank. It's unclear if other texts, purportedly sent earlier in the incident, were also believed fake. The messages, widely reported in South Korean media, painted a chaotic picture of the situation aboard the ferry as hundreds of passengers waited for help and some purportedly reached out to loved ones. 'We are not dead yet' ""No phone connection so there is no Internet connection. So just sending text message. There are few people on the ship, can't see a thing, it's totally dark. So there are few men and women, women are screaming,"" says one purported text message from a passenger obtained by CNN. ""There are a few people in the ship,"" the student writes to his mother, ""and we are not dead yet, so please send along this message."" A son reaches out . ""Mom, in case I won't get to tell you, I'm sending this. I love you,"" another message says, according to CNN affiliate YTN. The mom, apparently unaware of what was happening, responds, ""Why?"" Then, ""I, too, love you, son."" A father offers his child advice . In another exchange described by YTN, a father advises his teenager to go outside to reach rescuers. ""No -- I can't move because it is tilted too much. Moving is more dangerous,"" the teen replies. Later, the teen writes, ""No, Dad, I can't walk now. There are no kids in the hallway. And it is too tilted."" 'The ship got hit by something' ""I was on my way to Jeju Island,"" a passenger writes in a message to his brother, according to YTN. ""The ship got hit by something and is not moving and the coast guards are on the way."" CNN's KJ Kwon reported from Jindo, South Korea. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Words like ""landmark"" and ""historic"" are being used to describe this week's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. More than 40 heads of state, the President, dozens of American CEOs, celebrities, activists and several members of Congress -- myself included -- are participating in the three-day event. Every issue affecting the continent, from combating wildlife trafficking to food security, is on the agenda. Yet, of the 53 hours of official meetings scheduled for the summit, only two are dedicated to the critical issue of governance. That is scant treatment for what is perhaps the greatest impediment to security and economic growth in Africa. It also sends the wrong message about our shared priorities and values. In Africa, electing fresh, new leaders is not something people do often. Consider this: The 10 current longest-serving African leaders have held their offices for a total of 252 years. Three of these leaders (Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea, and Omar el-Bashir of Sudan) have not been invited to the summit because they are in poor standing with the United States. Of those receiving an invite, Rwanda's Paul Kagame and Uganda's Yoweri Museveni were unwisely hailed as ""new African leaders"" during the Clinton administration, while others came to power when Jimmy Carter was in the Oval Office. Needless to say, presidents serving in their 25th year generally don't promote free and fair elections and good governance. Elections are a pillar of democracy and good governance. When conducted freely, fairly and regularly, they give citizens their most effective tool for holding their leaders accountable and pressing policy makers for action and reform. In fact, the World Bank has shown that political competition, primarily through elections, is associated with improvements to a country's business environment. Not only do elections bolster economies, they can improve security. Take, for example, Liberia. Decades of protracted conflict and a deadly civil war resulted from corruption and massive human rights abuses by war criminal Charles Taylor, along with the political exclusion of whole swaths of the country's populace. But inclusive and democratic elections in 2006 brought to power Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female head of state. Now, Liberia is experiencing a much-needed period of political reconciliation and improved security. While Liberians certainly still face a number of challenges -- including the recent Ebola outbreak -- inclusive elections have proven to be a stabilizing force in West Africa. Despite the overstay of too many African leaders, there are reasons for hope. Eleven African countries are planning to hold elections next year, and 15 more countries have an election scheduled for 2016. In the next two years, more than half the leaders in sub-Saharan Africa are slated to stand for re-election. Each election day in these countries over the next two years will be a defining moment for the future of governance across the continent. 5 reasons Obama's Africa leaders' summit matters . The United States cannot be absent during this critical transition. We should support programs that improve the transparency of elections and encourage the peaceful transfer of power, which, unfortunately, far too many Africans have yet to see. Most importantly, the United States should push back on those leaders who seek to amend their constitutions to create imperial, indefinite presidencies. Two leaders most recently accused of seeking such constitutional changes -- Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso -- are in town for the Summit. Allowing them to return home without pressing for free, fair and regular elections would be an affront to the citizens of these two countries. Opinion: Africa and U.S.: Invest in human rights . President Obama once pressed for good governance aggressively. In 2009, when he traveled to Ghana and addressed that country's parliament, he took a ""no excuses"" approach toward African leaders. In an interview just before landing on the continent, the President noted that, ""I'm a big believer that Africans are responsible for Africa ... for many years we've made excuses about corruption or poor governance; that this was somehow the consequence of neo-colonialism, or the West has been oppressive, or racism. I'm not a believer in excuses. ... I think that it's very important for African leadership to take responsibility and be held accountable.""

"(CNN) -- Video aired in court Tuesday showed a team of masked men dressed like ninjas break into a Florida home -- with one of those men singling out Leonard Gonzalez Jr. as the group's ringleader who held a gun over Byrd Billings and shot him. Gonzalez, 35, is on trial for first-degree murder, with prosecutors alleging he and six others donned black masks and clothes before creeping into a Beulah, Florida, home on July 9, 2009, and killing Melanie and Byrd Billings execution-style. The Billingses had 16 cameras around their home, set up to keep tabs on the 13 special-needs children for whom they cared. Nine of the children were home during the invasion. One of the videos aired in court Tuesday shows the scene from one girl's bedroom as a red van packed with people arrives outside the house. The girl gets up out of bed as the masked men enter the house, then hides under the covers pretending to sleep after hearing the commotion nearby. Another camera depicts several people in a room, including a shirtless Byrd Billings and his wife. One man hovers over Byrd, gun in hand, and shoots him twice in the leg before leading Byrd and Melanie Billings upstairs. Frederick Thornton, who has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for his role in the invasion, identified the shooter in the video as Gonzalez. It was in the master bedroom, prosecutors say, that Gonzalez fatally shot the couple as one of their special-needs children watched from inside the room. Earlier Tuesday, Tony Eisa testified that he had turned down Gonzalez' request to be the getaway driver for the scheme. Prosecutors contend that the testimony of Eisa and others offering similar stories prove Gonzalez actively recruited people to be part of his plan, thus making him guilty of premeditated murder. ""He wanted me to be the getaway driver,"" said Eisa, recalling that Gonzalez was sweating and ""looked like he was up doing drugs."" ""I put my hand around the back of his neck, and escorted him out the door."" The defendant's wife, Tabitha Gonzalez, testified that the family's business, a karate school, had gone under. Prosecutors argue this indicates that financial gain was Leonard Gonzalez's overriding motive, as he headed the team plotting to steal the Billings family's safe, which they believed contained as much as $13 million. A small safe containing prescription medication, family documents and some jewelry was taken from the house, and later was found in the backyard of a woman who said she was a friend of Gonzalez, authorities have said. Two sources familiar with the investigation told CNN that a second safe at the home contained at least $100,000. ""He was so broke ... that his mother had to buy him a car, which turned out to be a big red van that was used in the murders,"" prosecutor Bill Eddins said in his opening statements of Gonzalez, who had six children with Tabitha. Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan has said Gonzalez once worked for a car dealership that Byrd Billings owned, and court documents state that Gonzalez received financial support from the family for his martial-arts studio. The Billings were known for their efforts caring for special needs children. A tearful Ashley Markham, the couple's daughter, testified Tuesday that she talked to one of those children minutes after her parents died. ""He was just screaming into the phone,"" she recalled. Of the eight people arrested in the case, seven males faced charges of murder and home invasion robbery. Two of them have already pleaded guilty to second-degree murder charges. The woman is accused of being an accessory after the fact. The remaining males, including a 16-year-old charged as an adult, have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The trial in Escambia County Circuit Court in Pensacola is expected to last three to four days. If convicted, Gonzalez could be sentenced to death.

"(CNN) -- Microsoft's revenue has been growing -- slowly, but growing. Profits have been growing faster than revenue, as the company clamps down on expenses. The company's core business software like Office 2010 has been showing great results for more than a year now, and the Xbox had its best holiday season ever, as Microsoft sold a million in a single day after Thanksgiving. Plus, it's got more than $50 billion in cash. So why has the company's stock stubbornly refused to move for the last decade? Why do big investors keep calling for CEO Steve Ballmer's head? The problem comes down to a simple statistic that should scare the heck out of Microsoft and its investors: . Five years ago, 95% of devices connected to the Internet were Windows PCs. Right now, less than 80% are, and some folks expect the number to drop below 20% in a few years. That's a historic shift, and is just one of many signals that the personal computer is no longer dominant in the ever-shifting world of consumer technology. Credit the explosion in smartphones, led by Apple's iPhone and a bunch of other phones running Google's Android (which is more popular than the iPhone by sheer numbers). Apple's iPad has also made a big dent, taking up the equivalent to about 10% of the PC market -- and it's less than 2 years old. Microsoft is nowhere in the worlds of smartphones or tablets. But this year, the company hopes to change all that. Next month, the company will let the masses download and test a not-quite-finished version of Windows 8, which Ballmer has called the most important product in company history. Windows 8 is going to be a little bit all over the place. On the surface, it will have a cool, modern look and feel that's meant to be used with touchscreen tablets. Call it an iPad killer if you will. It's cutting edge and friendly, filled with bright, colorful squares and sliding screens, and it's going to have a lot of features that will be familiar to iPhone and iPad users, like an app store. If you buy a Windows tablet, that's probably what you're going to see and use most of the time. But Windows 8 will also run on regular old PCs, and underneath the new tablet-friendly interface, it will look and feel a lot like the old version of Windows. If you're using a desktop PC or laptop PC at work, you'll probably end up using the old interface. It's a tricky balancing act to pull off, and lots could go wrong -- for instance, it's not exactly clear how smooth it will be to switch between the two types of Windows, or if you'll even be able to get the old Windows on certain types of tablets (that is, tablets that run the power-efficient ARM processors used by the iPad and most other tablets today). But if past Windows launches are any guide, Microsoft will help its cause by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on high-profile TV ads, viral whisper campaigns and ""co-marketing"" money for its PC hardware partners and the resellers who push Microsoft software to big corporations. But Windows 8 is only half the equation. Microsoft came out with a surprisingly good smartphone platform way back in fall 2010 -- in some ways, it was better than the iPhone from the moment it launched. But for a variety of reasons -- including mediocre phones that run the operating system, lack of support from big carriers like Verizon and some big gaps with features and apps -- it flopped. A year later, Microsoft 's Windows Phone platform is still at less than 2% market share, way behind Apple, Android and even the struggling BlackBerry. But this year, Microsoft has teamed up with Nokia, the biggest cell phone maker in the world, to push a new line of Windows Phones.

"(CNN) -- From elephants getting pedicures to hipsters holding their own Olympics, here's a look at some recent stories from CNN's affiliates around the world that are interesting, unique or just plain bizarre. Half-a-billion dollar drug bust . In Australia, police have busted a major drug ring, seizing half a billion dollars' worth of crystal methamphetamine and heroin stuffed into terra cotta pots, Nine Network reports. More than 674 pounds of meth and 555 pounds of heroin were seized as part of an operation that began a year ago when the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration tipped off officials in Australia. See some of the haul in the video above. Elephants get pedicures . Zookeepers at the Hongshan Forest Zoo in east China used a 2-foot-long file to give elephants there a pedicure. And they fed them apples while they got pampered! But the pedis weren't for beauty, as the CCTV report explains. Zookeepers say elephants' toenails wear down when they live in the wild, but because they don't have to travel long distances in captivity, their nails grow fast and need to be maintained to prevent bacteria infections. Watch more of the pedicures in the video above. Humans aren't the only ones that need a little spoiling sometimes. Germans compete in hipster Olympics . Some hipsters in Germany take cool to a whole other level. They're so cool, they have Olympics to prove it. Dozens of people turned out for the second annual ""Hipster Olympics,"" in the capital, Berlin. About 2,500 people gathered to watch the hipsters compete.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Controversial Dutch filmmaker Geert Wilders condemned as ""crazy and cowardly"" Britain's refusal to let him enter the country Thursday. Geert Wilders shows his passport and boarding pass at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport before leaving for London. Wilders, a Dutch lawmaker who produced a much-criticized film about Islam last year, flew to London for a screening of the movie despite being told a day earlier he would not be admitted. ""I still believed and hoped that they would change their tune,"" he told CNN by telephone, saying he was speaking from a detention room at London's Heathrow Airport. He said he was met by customs officers as soon as he left the plane. ""They took me to a detention center,"" Wilders said, and there he was interviewed ""for 45 seconds"" before they took his passport and left.  Watch Wilders condemn British government » . He called it a ""very sad day"" for ""freedom of speech in the European Union."" Wilders had been invited to screen his film, ""Fitna,"" at the House of Lords on Thursday evening. The 15-minute film features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from Islam's holy book, the Quran, to paint Islam as a threat to Western society. The British ambassador to the Netherlands told him Wednesday that he would be refused entry into Britain because the beliefs expressed in the film would threaten public security. Do you agree with the UK's decision to bar Wilders? Have your say . Britain's Home Office said barring Wilders is allowed under European Union law, which permits states to refuse entry on the grounds of public policy, public security or public health. ""The government opposes extremism in all its forms,"" said a Home Office spokesman, who would not be identified, in line with policy. ""It will stop those who want to spread extremism, hatred and violent messages in our communities from coming to our country."" Wilders is a member of the Dutch parliament for the right-wing Party for Freedom. He released ""Fitna"" online in March 2008 to immediate controversy. The 15-minute film features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from Islam's holy book, the Quran, to paint Islam as a threat to Western society. Caroline Cox, a member of Britain's House of Lords who is not affiliated with a political party, invited Wilders to screen his film at a private session in parliament. She told CNN that she wanted lawmakers to see the film to provoke discussion. ""We're showing it on the basis of freedom of speech,"" said Cox, who has been a free speech advocate throughout her career. ""It's a serious showing, with serious concerns and serious consideration."" Cox said she disagreed with the government's decision to bar Wilders, who was also scheduled to discuss the film. ""I think it's appalling,"" she told CNN. ""(For) the British government to prevent a European parliamentarian coming to speak to parliamentarians over here is very disturbing. I think it will be ready by many people as a sign of appeasement to threat and intimidation."" After its release, the movie drew complaints from the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, as well as concern from the United States, which warned it could spark riots. Dutch authorities filed charges against Wilders last month, accusing him of inciting racial hatred in speeches and in the film. ""Fitna"" opens with a controversial caricature of the Prophet Mohammed wearing a turban shaped like a bomb, followed by translated portions of the Quran. The passages are interspersed with graphic images of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States, juxtaposed with audio from 911 calls made by the victims trapped inside the World Trade Center in New York. The video includes images of other terror attacks; bloodied victims; beheadings of hostages; executions of women in hijab, the traditional full-body covering; and footage, with subtitles, of Islamic leaders preaching inflammatory sermons against Jews and Christians. In his interview with the BBC, Wilders said he does not hate Muslims but opposes the ""Islamization"" of the European continent. The title ""Fitna,"" is Arabic for ""strife"" or ""conflict"" of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group. Five years ago, Dutch director Theo van Gogh was stabbed to death by a member of a radical Islamic group after his short film ""Submission"" used verses from the Quran written on women's bodies to criticize the treatment of women in Islamic cultures. His co-producer on the project, Somali-born former Dutch lawmaker Ayaan Hirsi Ali, lived under government protection for several years after van Gogh's killing. She now lives in the United States.","Controversial Dutch filmmaker refused entry to Britain .

"Rancho Palos Verdes, California (CNN) -- The next version of Windows will look a lot like Windows Phone 7. But the familiar PC design is still there under the hood. Microsoft unveiled the design for Windows 8 at the All Things Digital conference here on Wednesday. The software giant plans to provide a more extensive demonstration at a conference for application developers in September. Windows 8, which may not be the final name for the operating system, won't be available in stores this fall, as optimists had predicted, said Steven Sinofsky, the Windows division president. Analysts expect it to be released next year. The vast majority of PCs sold run Windows, but the tablet market currently belongs to Apple. Microsoft put a large focus on tablets during the Windows 8 presentation. Microsoft has been taking stabs at tablet PCs over the last decade. The company failed at its attempts to effectively adapt the Windows desktop, Start menu and all, to touchscreens. In a grand concession, Microsoft is now borrowing a page from Apple's iOS and Google's Android. Windows 8 takes the colorful tiles and finger-swipe gestures from the Windows Phone operating system and expands them to a larger screen -- in this demo, 10.6 inches diagonally. Like a smartphone, the system lights up to a ""lock screen,"" which has some alerts and diagnostic information set atop a background picture. Once inside, small squares represent each app containing snippets of information. A finger swipe on the right side of the screen opens a menu of buttons for functions like search, sharing and a shortcut to the home screen. Swiping on the left side switches between open apps. Microsoft will ask developers to write software tailored to the new look. But the system will also run older Windows programs. They open to a screen that resembles the classic desktop, but windows can be dragged with a finger. Sinofsky, the Windows head, stressed the importance of not abandoning the established and reliable technologies from the PC era. ""A mouse has a precision that your finger can't approach,"" he said. ""The mouse and the keyboard are just tools. They're not evil in and of themselves."" Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, who took the stage after the Microsoft folks, entertained the idea of building a Windows tablet. Thanks to a recent partnership, Nokia has ""a very unique relationship with Microsoft,"" and Windows 8 looks ""beautiful,"" Elop said. Companies with less unique relationships with Microsoft aren't as enthusiastic. For example, Acer CEO J.T. Wang told Bloomberg that Microsoft was trying to set restrictions on software licensees. Microsoft comes into tablets as the underdog. The modern tablet war is already a year old, and new entrants are marching. BlackBerry maker Research in Motion is targeting businesses with its PlayBook, and Hewlett-Packard plans to install its webOS software on the computers, printers, phones and tablets it makes. HP may also license webOS to other hardware manufacturers, HP CEO Leo Apotheker said here on Wednesday. Windows 8 is still in development, so it's unclear how well the system will run on tablets. The demo was silky smooth, but the touchscreen Microsoft used was connected to a hidden desktop computer, rather than contained within the portable hardware. Microsoft says Windows 8 will be able to run on processors designed by ARM Holdings, in addition to Intel chips. That's an important addition because ARM's technology is winning among most smartphone and tablet makers. ARM President Tudor Brown predicted on Monday that his chips will be used in at least half of all mobile devices sold, which includes laptops.","Windows 8 looks much like Windows Phone but also has the familiar desktop look .

"(CNN) -- Samir Khan was proud to be a traitor. In a way, he was among the most dangerous of al Qaeda terrorists. By turning his back on the country he grew up in, he gained credibility and coupled that with his intimate knowledge of Western culture to become a driving force behind a powerful al Qaeda propaganda machine. The one-time North Carolina resident, who U.S. and Yemeni officials say was killed with Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in a drone strike Friday morning, used his knowledge of computers to help produce a glossy, Western-style magazine called Inspire that touted the edicts of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP. Just what motivates a man who has spent much of his life growing up in the United States to wage jihad against it? Many of the answers are provided by Khan himself in an article he penned for Inspire titled, ""I Am Proud to Be a Traitor to America."" In the article, Khan details his journey from North Carolina to Yemen, writing that ""Washington's imperialism"" was something he could no longer tolerate. ""What they have done and continue to do in the Muslim lands is what I felt, totally unacceptable to my religion."" He details how he relied on his U.S. right to free speech to become more vocal about his anger toward U.S. foreign policies. He also writes that he was aware he was being watched by the FBI, something that played a role in his decision to flee. (A senior law enforcement official tells CNN Khan was being investigated by the FBI office in North Carolina, which determined it didn't have enough evidence to seek an indictment against him.) ""I decided to take up the pen and write out my thoughts and feelings regarding America's cowboy behavior in the Islamic lands"" wrote Khan. ""I knew that I had to stay under the guidelines of the laws regarding freedom of speech, but at the same time, I knew the real truth wouldn't be able to reach the masses unless and until I was above the law."" Khan fled to Yemen in 2009 and intelligence officials believe it was soon afterward that he became the editor of Inspire magazine. The official explanation of Khan's presence in Yemen was that he had gone to ""teach English,"" which had become code in intelligence circles for attending radicalization classes. The publication of the magazine was also concerning to intelligence officials as it became a significant tool in AQAP's recruiting effort and a signified a dangerous shift by providing the know-how for sympathizers to carry out attacks. ""The primary focus of the magazine is to inspire individuals to not just fly to Yemen and join the group, but rather to provide them with the inspiration, the ideological framework, the targeting philosophy and the practical mechanics of building a bomb or conducting a shooting,"" said Ben Venzke, CEO of IntelCenter, a private company that provides intelligence analysis to governments. ""To do it all, without ever having to step foot in a training camp but never having to come in physical contact with a terrorist,"" Venzke said. ""And this allows AQAP to not only conduct attacks against the U.S., but at no cost financially or in terms of security to the group, they are able to add this force multiplier to their operations, because if even one person follows the direction of the magazine, that's a great success."" The deaths of both al-Awlaki and Khan are believed to be a significant blow to the future of the magazine. Clearly, AQAP understood its value. In a recently released supplement to Inspire marking the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Khan identified an AQAP leader, Sheikh Abu Basir, as saying, ""The media work is half of the jihad."" He also quotes someone he describes as a ""brother"" as saying, ""A powerful media production is as hard-hitting as an operation in America."" It's a significance not lost on intelligence professionals, who see Khan's death as a ""two-fer,"" with al-Awlaki being the primary target. ""Khan is unique in the sense that like al-Awlaki, he spoke English and had an appeal to the Western mind. He knew how to write and had the technical ability to use the Web,"" said former U.S. National Security Adviser Fran Townsend, now a CNN contributor. CNN Terrorism Analyst Peter Bergen added, ""The fact that the editor of the magazine (Khan) has also been killed is a problem for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly as it relates to their Western recruitment effort, because the two people who principally spoke to the Western world are now dead."" Townsend suggests intelligence officials will be looking closely at those who are willing to step up and fill the role -- that is, if AQAP can find anyone with the same command of the language and computer skills to do it. ""That will be a strong indicator of how resilient the organization is,"" she said. ""Over time, replacements tend to be less experienced."" In Charlotte, North Carolina, Khan family friend Jibril Hough told CNN that Khan's father did not agree with his son's views. ""His father is feeling a number of emotions, not just today, but over the past few years,"" Hough said. ""Emotions such as embarrassment, frustration and heavy sadness, because it was his son. Regardless of the disagreements that he had, it was his flesh and blood."" Hough, who runs an Islamic center where Samir Khan had occasionally prayed, expressed disappointment that the U.S. government opted to kill U.S. citizens who were not themselves known to be violent rather than capturing and trying them. ""That is the American way -- or should be the American way."" CNN's Pam Benson, Joe Sutton and Terry Frieden contributed to this report .","Khan was a driving force behind a powerful al Qaeda propaganda machine .

"(CNN) -- At about 33 feet long, weighing 4 to 5 tons and baring large blade-shaped teeth, the dinosaur Torvosaurus gurneyi was a formidable creature. ""I suppose it wouldn't be a good idea to cross the way of this dinosaur,"" said Christophe Hendrickx, doctoral candidate at the New University of Lisbon in Portugal. Thanks to Hendrickx and paleontologist Octavio Mateus, Torvosaurus gurneyi may have the distinction of being the largest terrestrial predator found in Europe. Hendrickx and Mateus describe this dinosaur in a new study in the journal PLOS One. The remains of Torvosaurus gurneyi were discovered at the Lourinha Formation, a fruitful site of dinosaur bones north of Lisbon. Before this study, bones that scientists say belong to the new species were thought to belong to Torvosaurus tanneri, a North American dinosaur species. But comparisons between the remains of the Portuguese and North American specimens suggest that they warrant distinct species names. For instance, Torvosaurus tanneri had at least 11 teeth, while Torvosaurus gurneyi had fewer, scientists said. Torvosaurus gurneyi lived about 150 million years ago. The continents had previously all been one land mass, but by the time of this dinosaur, the Iberian Peninsula had broken off from North America, Hendrickx said. ""The study provides compelling evidence in support of the hypothesis that temporary connections between North America and Europe existed during the Late Jurassic, and these allowed for intercontinental faunal mixing,"" Gregory Erickson, a Florida State University paleobiologist not involved in the study, said via e-mail. Subsequent geographic isolation led to the development of distinct species, Erickson said. The Tyrannosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus from the Cretaceous period -- defined as 145.5 million to 65.5 million years ago -- were larger than Torvosaurus gurneyi. But this European giant seems to have been a powerful predator. The dinosaur appears to have been a carnivore that probably ate herbivorous dinosaurs. Its teeth were nearly 4 inches long; its skull was thought to be about 45 inches long. The environment where it lived was tropical, with temperatures ranging from 86 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. A diverse collection of dinosaurs roamed the area. ""The fauna was certainly dominated by dinosaurs,"" Hendrickx said. Specimens that most likely belong to this species include an upper jaw bone, teeth and partial tail vertebrae, remnants discovered in 2003. Hendrickx proposes other material found at the same site in Portugal also belongs to Torvosaurus gurneyi. A tibia and femur seem to fit the profile, as do embryos that Hendrickx, Mateus and colleagues described in the journal Nature last year. Torvosaurus gurneyi could have been covered with proto-feathers, given evidence from closely related dinosaurs, the scientists said. But as for its colors, no one yet knows. Erickson called the discovery exciting. It demonstrates that large theropods -- meat-eating dinosaurs -- lived in Europe during the Late Jurassic. ""Torvosaurus gurneyi was the T. rex of its time,"" Erickson said. Hendrickx named the species after James Gurney, an artist and writer known for the illustrated ""Dinotopia"" book series about -- guess what? -- a society of people and dinosaurs.

"(CNN) -- CNN reported Monday on the heart-rending story of Emily Bauer, a teenager from Houston, who suffered a debilitating stroke after consuming what has come to be known as ""synthetic marijuana."" Although the role that synthetic marijuana played in Emily's medical condition is not yet clear, what is clear is that these new chemicals might not even exist if it weren't for the prohibition of marijuana, a plant that has been widely consumed throughout the world for thousands of years. A few years ago, people started using synthetic marijuana to evade drug tests -- and it caught on, once news reports publicized its existence. And even though President Obama and 41 governors have signed legislation criminalizing various forms of synthetic marijuana, this stuff isn't going away -- that is, until we legally regulate marijuana itself. To understand drug use by teenagers, we must acknowledge that they have grown up with drugs everywhere. We urge young people to be ""drug-free,"" but Americans are bombarded with messages encouraging us to imbibe and medicate with a variety of substances: We use caffeine to boost our energy, we drink alcohol to relax, and we use prescription and over-the-counter drugs to help us work, study and sleep. And despite the draconian punishments associated with illegal drugs, 44% of today's teens will try them before graduating from high school. Marijuana itself is the most widely consumed illegal drug -- more than 100 million Americans have used it and 20 million have been arrested for it since 1965. Not surprisingly, given the laws of supply and demand, enterprising chemists have discovered an endless array of marijuana-like chemicals that can be sprayed onto potpourri-like plant matter and sold as ""incense."" People who have tried synthetic marijuana often report psychoactive effects that are comparable to marijuana, but notably less pleasurable. Almost no one would touch this synthetic stuff -- actually, it wouldn't even exist -- if it weren't for the criminalization of the marijuana plant itself. Attempting to ban one new substance after another is like a game of whack-a-mole: Each time one gets banned, another untested and potentially more dangerous drug pops up to replace it. The synthetic marijuana that Emily Bauer consumed was likely one of the ""second generation"" of synthetic marijuana chemicals. Since Congress and state legislatures banned a host of them over the past two years, the companies producing these products have simply changed their chemical formulations to one of thousands of slightly different chemicals with marijuana-like effects. These new synthetic marijuana products are not an example of effective legal regulation, but an example of underregulation. Like aspirin or soft drinks, they are not subject to age, licensing, or other restrictions. Oddly enough, the rush to criminalize synthetic marijuana and other synthetic drugs comes at a time when public opinion is dramatically shifting in favor of decriminalizing, and even legally regulating, marijuana. More than three-quarters of American voters believe marijuana should be decriminalized, which 14 states have done. They also believe it should be available for medical use, which 18 states and the District of Columbia now allow; and about half think it should be legally regulated more or less like alcohol, as Colorado and Washington are doing. After decades of marijuana prohibition, elected officials and the public are finally realizing that regulating the production and sale of marijuana is the best way to reduce the harms of the illicit marijuana market and the harms of marijuana use itself. It's important to note that the marijuana legalization initiatives overwhelmingly passed by voters in Colorado and Washington last November create strictly regulated regimes -- with age restrictions (21 and older) accompanied by meticulous government oversight of producers and retail distributors. On the other hand, synthetic marijuana -- whether underregulated or outright prohibited -- hasn't ever been subject to an appropriate level of regulation. Before rushing to criminalize a new drug, legislators ought to ask: What specific regulatory options would help to reduce the harm to individuals, families and society? We need to ask what's the best way to solve the problem -- how to reduce drug abuse and addiction -- and use the best evidence to guide us. And the evidence clearly shows that effective, legal regulation reduces the harm of drugs better than prohibition ever does. We have already learned a lot from regulating other substances, such as alcohol and tobacco. Product labeling requirements, as well as marketing, branding and retail display restrictions, are proven to reduce youth access to tobacco products and impulse tobacco purchases. Tobacco has contributed to more deaths than alcohol and illicit drugs combined. As a result of education initiatives and marketing and age restrictions, smoking has declined dramatically over time -- despite its legality for adults -- in one of the greatest public health success stories of the last generation. Outright criminalization only drives the demand for the drug to the illicit market. Under prohibition, regulators have no control over where the product is sold, who sells it, or to whom they sell it. Arresting young people, moreover, often causes more damage than drug use itself. After 40 years of the ""war on drugs,"" the evidence clearly shows that it is ineffective to use the criminal justice system to send public health messages. Prohibition simply creates new public health problems and maximizes the harm associated with illegal drug use. Indeed, drugs, whether marijuana or synthetic marijuana, should not be legally regulated because they are safe -- they should be legally regulated precisely because they can be harmful.

"(CNN) -- This journey began with such a simple idea: a day of peace. We all want a world without war, without conflict, without human suffering. A single day is a window of opportunity. On September 21 last year, Peace Day 2011, my organization, Peace One Day launched the 365-day countdown toward a global truce -- what we hope will be the largest reduction in global violence in recorded history, both domestically and internationally, and the biggest ever gathering of individuals in the name of peace. It would be the global community's legacy, not mine. What we want to tell individuals is that the power to change the world lies in their hands. I don't believe in cynicism, in apathy; it doesn't get you anywhere. Cynicism kills potential and possibility. And if we're not working towards a better world, what's the point? When I was younger, I read a book by Frank Barnaby, this wonderful nuclear physicist. He said that media had a responsibility, that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and move things forward. And that fascinated me. I was concerned about what was going on in the world. I couldn't understand the starvation, the destruction, the killing of innocent people. I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life; I thought, well maybe I could do something. Maybe I could become a filmmaker. Maybe I can use the form of film constructively. TED.com: In defense of dialogue . I thought I could go and film older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of what was going on around the world. But I realized that a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough, that there needed to be a mountain to climb, there needed to be a journey that I had to take. And if I took that journey, it would be completely irrelevant whether it failed or succeeded. The point is that there would be a hook: Is the destruction of the world inevitable? Is humankind fundamentally evil? As we become a global community, are we becoming indifferent to one another? When it comes to the fundamental issues that humanity faces, solutions involve shifting consciousness towards cooperation. A single day is an achievable starting point. Making that starting point a self-sustaining, institutionalized celebration is what we work towards at Peace One Day. TED.com: Poems of war, peace, women and power . Each year, September 21 marks Peace Day -- a day for wide-scale community action, and a day for United Nations agencies and aid organizations to safely carry out life-saving work. By 2007, 100 million people were active on Peace Day and since then, Peace Day agreements by all parties to conflict in Afghanistan have resulted in the immunization against polio of 4.5 million children in areas hitherto unreachable or hard to reach due to conflict. On Peace Day 2008, the U.N. Department for Safety and Security recorded a 70% reduction in violent incidents in Afghanistan. For Peace Day 2012, we are inviting all sectors of society to observe a day of Global Truce -- individuals in every country, at home, in schools, in the workplace, in our local communities, and those engaged in armed conflict on the international stage. Everyone has a role to play. The Global Truce 2012 campaign will only work if the people get behind it-- if you get behind it. Please join the campaign via www.peaceoneday.org and ask as many people as you can to do the same, via social media or via the new free Peace One Day App. Individuals can make a difference.

"(CNN) -- Voters in Honduras have elected a new president, but it remained in question Monday whether the international community would recognize conservative candidate Porfirio Lobo Sosa. Lobo's legitimacy remains in doubt because Sunday's elections were held under the rule of interim President Roberto Micheletti, who assumed power after a June 28 coup ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya. Many nations said before the election they would withhold recognition if Zelaya were not returned to power. Divisions remained Monday. The United States, Colombia and Costa Rica said they would recognize Lobo. Argentina, Brazil and Spain said they would not. Zelaya, who had called for an election boycott that apparently failed, said he would not recognize the results. The United States on Monday urged Honduras to take the next steps toward resolving the crisis, such as having the nation's Congress vote on whether to restore Zelaya to power. That vote was one of the provisions of a pact that representatives for Zelaya and Micheletti signed in late October. ""While the election is a necessary one, it is not a sufficient one,"" said Arturo Valenzuela, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal has not made the election results official, but the vote showed that opposition National Party candidate Lobo defeated Elvin Santos of the Liberal Party. Zelaya and Micheletti are Liberal Party members, and their rift splintered the party and may have hurt Santos. Lobo vowed Monday to bring the divided nation back together. ""Nobody wins with this situation,"" he said in an interview with CNN affiliate Televicentro TV. ""We all lose. It's unjust to maintain a polarized country."" Lobo said Monday he had not talked with Zelaya but had indicated earlier he was willing to meet with the deposed president. Zelaya, who had been flown to Costa Rica on the day of the coup, has been staying at the Brazilian Embassy in Honduras' capital since returning secretly to the country September 21. Asked if he would meet with Zelaya, Lobo said, ""I will do all that is necessary to bring peace to Honduras."" Some analysts say Lobo has little choice, given the isolation Honduras has been under since the coup. ""Lobo Sosa will probably move to create a unity government and grant Zelaya political amnesty in order to end the political conflict following Zelaya's ouster,"" said Heather Berkman, an analyst for the Eurasia Group consulting firm. Lobo's victory Sunday was a political redemption. He narrowly lost the presidential election to Zelaya in November 2005, winning 46 percent of the vote. ""Four years is a short time,"" he said jubilantly at his victory speech early Monday. Zelaya supporters said this year that Lobo was one of four presidential candidates who supported the coup. Lobo, whose name means ""wolf"" in Spanish, has an easy and toothy smile and intense eyes. His nickname is Pepe. He turns 62 later this month, has been a member of Congress since 1990 and was its president from 2002 to 2006. He earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Miami. ""I am a simple type, originally from Juticalpa, Olancho,"" he says on his Facebook page. ""I am of few words but much action. My parents inculcated in me a love for work since I was very young. I have been a cattleman, a farmer, a businessman."" In addition to the presidency, at stake in Sunday's election were three vice presidencies, 128 congressional seats and posts for mayor and other municipal seats. The other three presidential candidates were Bernard Martinez of the Innovation and Unity Party-Social-Democracy (PINU), Felicito Avila of the Christian Democrat Party (CD) and Cesar Ham of the Democratic Unification Party (PUD). A sixth candidate, Carlos Reyes, withdrew in early November. The United States issued a statement Sunday, commending Honduras for the election. ""Turnout appears to have exceeded that of the last presidential election,"" the statement said. ""This shows that given the opportunity to express themselves, the Honduran people have viewed the election as an important part of the solution to the political crisis in their country."" The United Nations, the Organization of American States, the European Union and most nations -- including the United States -- had condemned the coup over the summer and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated immediately. It looked like a solution to the crisis had been reached October 29, when Zelaya and Micheletti agreed to a deal brokered by the United States. The pact said Congress would vote on whether to reinstate Zelaya to power after consultation with the nation's Supreme Court and other bodies. That vote is scheduled for this week. The Supreme Court ruled last week that Zelaya could not return to office without first facing trial on charges that he acted unconstitutionally when he tried to hold a vote that could have led to the removal of presidential term limits. The Supreme Court had ruled that the vote was illegal and Congress had forbidden it. The coup came on the day that the term-limits vote was to have been held. Micheletti and his supporters have insisted that Zelaya's removal was a constitutional transfer of power, not a coup. Some leaders of large Latin American countries, particularly those that have been ruled under dictatorships in recent years, are concerned that allowing the election results to stand could embolden other ""adventurers"" to try to stage coups. Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said Monday the election was ""a mockery"" carried out ""in the most absolute illegality,"" the state-run Telam news agency reported. Argentina was ruled by a right-wing dictatorship from 1976 to 1983. Micheletti stepped down temporarily last week to try to distance himself from Sunday's elections. He said he would resume office Wednesday. In a letter to the nation Sunday night, Micheletti congratulated Hondurans for the peaceful and substantial turnout. There were no official tallies Monday of how many Hondurans voted. Despite fears of unrest, election day was calm and without major incident. About 35,000 police and soldiers were deployed across the country. Amnesty International on Sunday urged Honduran authorities to reveal the identities, whereabouts and charges against all people detained over the weekend. The new president is scheduled to be sworn in January 27. CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Voting took place under rule of president who took power after June coup .

"(CNN) -- The World Cup's most prolific goal scorer has hung up his golden boots. Germany striker Miroslav Klose, who scored a total of 16 goals at four World Cup finals, announced his retirement from international football on Monday. The 36-year-old scored two goals at this summer's tournament to surpass former Brazil striker Ronaldo's record of 15 as Germany lifted the trophy for the first time in 24 years. Polish-born Klose scored five goals at the 2002 World Cup in Korea/Japan and five more in Germany four years later -- a feat that earned him the Golden Boot that year. Four more followed in South Africa in 2010 before two goals -- a crucial equalizer in the group game against Ghana and a second in Germany's 7-1 rout of hosts Brazil in the semifinals -- completed his tally. Klose also has the distinction of being Germany's all-time top goal scorer with 71 goals from 137 internationals. ""The success of the team stood and always stands for me in the highest place,"" Klose said in a statement published on the German national side's official website. ""With the national team I achieved our greatest goal, a goal which we had together within the squad. ""In addition, I achieved personal goals and those who know me know that I am very ambitious, but I am a striker and the task of a striker is to score goals. ""Therefore the records never concerned me, but it was always about giving my best for the team."" German national coach, Joachim Low heaped praise on the retiring marksman. ""He has given everything for Germany,"" Low said in a statement. ""I have the greatest respect for Miroslav's decision as well as (his) incredible national team career that will be hard to beat ... I am happy and grateful that I was able to work with Miroslav Klose. The striker announced in July that he will play club football for one more season before retiring altogether. Klose, who joined Lazio from Bayern Munich in 2011, signed a one-year extension to his contract with the Serie A side in May.

"Moscow (CNN) -- The computer contractor who exposed details of U.S. surveillance programs was on the run late Sunday, seeking asylum in Ecuador with the aid of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, the organization and Ecuador's Foreign Ministry announced. Edward Snowden left Hong Kong after Washington sought his extradition on espionage charges, according to WikiLeaks, which facilitates the publication of classified information. ""He is bound for the Republic of Ecuador via a safe route for the purposes of asylum and is being escorted by diplomats and legal advisers from WikiLeaks,"" the group said. Ecuador's foreign ministry said it had received a request for asylum from Snowden, and a CNN crew spotted a car with diplomatic plates and an Ecuadorian flag at the Russian capital's international airport. Ecuador has already given WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange refuge in its embassy in London for a year after he unsuccessfully fought extradition to Sweden in British courts. In Washington, the response was swift. The Obama administration asked Ecuador, Cuba and Venezuela, not to admit Snowden or to expel him if they do, a senior Obama administration official told CNN on Sunday. It also urged countries through which he might pass not to accept him. The Justice Department said it was ""disappointed"" in the decision by Hong Kong authorities to allow Snowden to leave the semi-autonomous Chinese territory, arguing it had followed the proper legal steps to have him held and sent back to the United States. U.S. and Hong Kong officials had ""repeated engagements"" over the case, and Attorney General Eric Holder discussed the matter with his counterpart in Hong Kong last week, the department said. ""At no point, in all of our discussions through Friday, did the authorities in Hong Kong raise any issues regarding the sufficiency of the U.S.'s provisional arrest request,"" a statement from the department said. ""In light of this, we find their decision to be particularly troubling."" And a source familiar with the matter told CNN that the U.S. government has revoked Snowden's passport. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said it was routine to revoke the passports of people charged with felonies. She would not comment specifically on the status of Snowden's passport but said anyone wanted on a felony charge, ""such as Mr. Snowden,"" should be stopped from ""any further international travel, other than is necessary to return him to the United States."" Among those accompanying Snowden is former Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, now the lawyer for WikiLeaks and Assange, according to a statement from the organization. ""The WikiLeaks legal team and I are interested in preserving Mr. Snowden's rights and protecting him as a person,"" Garzon said. ""What is being done to Mr. Snowden and to Mr. Julian Assange -- for making or facilitating disclosures in the public interest -- is an assault against the people."" Garzon added in a statement Monday that Snowden has sought his legal advice. Garzon said he has not yet decided whether to represent Snowden. Assange sought asylum in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. He has repeatedly said the allegations are politically motivated and that he fears Sweden would transfer him to the United States. There are no charges pending against Assange in the United States. But a U.S. Army private who military prosecutors say leaked a vast cache of classified documents to WikiLeaks is now being court-martialed on charges of aiding the enemy, and he faces life in prison if convicted. Snowden has admitted he was the source who leaked classified documents about the NSA's surveillance programs to the British newspaper the Guardian and to The Washington Post. The documents revealed the existence of programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of overseas residents. NSA chief: Snowden 'betrayed' our trust . Snowden gave up a comfortable life ""in order to bring to light what he believed was serious wrongdoing on the part of our political officials,"" said Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian columnist who co-authored the stories. ""And he's now at best going to spend the rest of his life on the run from the most powerful government on Earth."" The disclosures rocked the Obama administration and U.S. intelligence, raising questions about whether the NSA was infringing on American civil liberties. Snowden told the Guardian that he exposed the surveillance programs because they posed a threat to democracy, but administration officials said the programs are vital to preventing terrorist attacks and are overseen by all three branches of government. ""We have not in a single case had a place where a government official engaged in willful effort to circumvent or violate the law. Zero times have we done that,"" Gen. Keith Alexander, the NSA's director, told ABC's ""This Week."" Snowden was a Hawaii-based computer network administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton, an NSA contractor. Alexander said Snowden ""betrayed the trust and confidence we had in him"" and is ""not acting, in my opinion, with noble intent."" ""This was an individual with top-secret clearance, whose duty it was to administer these networks,"" Alexander said. ""He betrayed that confidence and stole some of our secrets."" He said the super-secret communications intelligence agency has changed passwords and procedures since Snowden's disclosures -- ""But at the end of the day, we have to trust that our people are going to do the right thing."" Greenwald said Snowden has been extremely judicious about what he has revealed. ""I know that he has in his possession thousands of documents which if published would impose crippling damage on the United States' surveillance capabilities and systems around the world. He has never done any of that,"" Greenwald told CNN. ""If his goal were to harm the United States, there were all sorts of things he could have done, from uploading those documents on the Internet to selling them to a foreign intelligence service."" Hong Kong: Extradition request didn't comply with requirements . Snowden left Hong Kong ""through a lawful and normal channel,"" the government of the semi-autonomous Chinese territory said Sunday. The U.S. government announced Friday that it was charging Snowden with espionage and theft of government property and asked Hong Kong to hold him for extradition proceedings. In a statement Sunday, Justice Department spokeswoman Nanda Chitre said Hong Kong authorities had informed U.S. officials of Snowden's departure. ""We will continue to discuss this matter with Hong Kong and pursue relevant law enforcement cooperation with other countries where Mr. Snowden may be attempting to travel,"" she said. Hong Kong said the American request for a provisional arrest warrant ""did not fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law"" so it asked for additional information. Because Hong Kong didn't have enough information, ""there is no legal basis to restrict Mr. Snowden from leaving Hong Kong,"" the government said. But a Justice Department official said Sunday that the United States had met requirements and disputed the assertion from Hong Kong's government. ""They came back to us with a few questions late Friday and we were in the process of answering those questions,"" the official said. ""We believe we were meeting those requirements. As far as the relationship with Hong Kong goes, this raises questions and we will continue to discuss with authorities there."" Hong Kong's lack of intervention came after Snowden told the South China Morning Post that U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking computer networks in Hong Kong and mainland China for years. The territory's government said it has requested ""clarification"" about that in order ""to protect the legal rights of the people of Hong Kong."" Snowden 'told the truth in the name of privacy,' Paul says . President Barack Obama, top legislators and national security officials defend the surveillance programs Snowden detailed as necessary to combat terrorism and argue that some privacy must be sacrificed in a balanced approach. In a chat session moderated by the Guardian last week, Snowden said he went ahead with the leak because Obama worsened ""abusive"" practices instead of curtailing them as he promised as a candidate. Obama has been receiving updates on the Snowden case from national security aides, a senior administration official told CNN. But Snowden's revelations also sparked criticism from U.S. spy chief James Clapper, who told the Senate Intelligence Committee in March that the NSA didn't ""wittingly"" collect data on millions of Americans. After Snowden's revelations, Clapper told NBC that he answered ""in what I thought was the most truthful, or least untruthful manner"" to the question from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told CNN's State of the Union that both Clapper and Snowden will be judged by history. ""Mr. Clapper lied in Congress, in defiance of the law, in the name of security. Mr. Snowden told the truth in the name of privacy,"" said Paul, the son of former Libertarian-turned-Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul. Paul said that unlike civil rights protesters who broke the law and submitted to the courts to make a statement, Snowden faces a ""disproportionate"" penalty. But he added that Snowden's actions may be judged more harshly if he ""cozies up"" to an oppressive government overseas. ""If he goes to an independent third country like Iceland and if he refuses to talk to any sort of formal government about this, I think there's a chance that he'll be seen as an advocate of privacy,"" Paul said. ""If he cozies up to either the Russian government, the Chinese government, or any of these governments that are perceived still as enemies of ours, I think that that will be a real problem for him in history."" CNN's Phil Black reported from Moscow. CNN's Matt Smith and Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Next Tuesday and Wednesday, the nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on two momentous cases. In one, the court will be asked to decide whether same-sex couples have a right to marry in California despite the passage of a referendum against it. In the other, the parties will argue over the Defense of Marriage Act, which, among other things, makes it legal to deny Social Security, pension and tax benefits to gay and lesbian couples. Where do you stand on these issues? CNN Opinion on Wednesday begins a special series of pieces on the topic. We're inviting you to examine your own views and to see which states have laws corresponding to your stances. Our columns over the next several days will include pieces by John Sutter, who finds that America has a state-by-state patchwork of rules on marriage, employment and legal protections applying to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans and calls for changes. Other writers will argue against many of those changes, in accompanying opinion pieces. The cases before the Supreme Court proceed against the backdrop of rapidly shifting views over the rights extended to LGBT Americans. In 2008, a CNN poll found that 53% of Americans believed marriages between gay and lesbian couples should not be recognized by the law as valid. Last year, a similar CNN poll found that 54% now favor such marriages. In 1998, 51% of Americans said someone who is homosexual could change their sexual orientation. By last May, 34% held that view. Opinion: Gay marriage, then group marriage? President Barack Obama, who said during his 2008 campaign that marriage was ""between a man and a woman,"" in May declared his support for same-sex marriage, and the administration has now put its weight behind supporters of gay marriage before the Supreme Court. In that case, two lawyers who argued opposite sides of the landmark 2000 Bush v. Gore case, which decided that presidential election, Republican Ted Olson and Democrat David Boies, are united in pushing for legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Prominent Washington attorney Charles Cooper will lead the defense of Proposition 8, the California referendum against same-sex marriage. But while same-sex marriage grabs the headlines, there are many other issues relating to gay rights. Should states prohibit people from being fired because of their sexual orientation? A majority of them do not, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Listen: Voices from the Southern closet . Should public school teachers be allowed to talk in class about homosexuality? Should states ban gays from adopting children? All of these questions can be explored in the interactive calculator CNN created to help shed light on the difference in legal protections among the 50 states. The calculator enables you to enter your own views and find out which states correspond most closely. We hope this coverage will prompt debate, and we look forward to hearing what you think.","Supreme Court to hear two momentous cases on same-sex marriage .

"Washington (CNN) -- Maryland's highest court has ruled that a lesbian couple married out of state can legally file for divorce, even though Maryland's own same-sex marriage law does not take effect until next year. The issue is whether states without legalized same-sex marriage can recognize gay or lesbian weddings outside their borders. The appeal involved a Prince George's County couple, Jessica Port and Virginia Anne Cowan. ""Maryland courts will withhold recognition of a valid foreign marriage only if that marriage is 'repugnant' to state public policy. This threshold, a high bar, has not been met yet,"" the seven state Court of Appeals justices said in their 21-page opinion. ""The present case will be treated no differently. "" The couple were married in a 2008 civil ceremony in San Francisco, during a short window when California recognized same-sex marriage. A voter referendum in California later outlawed same-sex marriage, but a federal appeals court recently ruled against that ban. It said such a ban was unconstitutional and singled out gays and lesbians for discrimination. The case appears to be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The couple, who did not have children, settled in suburban Washington. They eventually separated and filed for divorce in Maryland when their relationship went sour, their attorneys have said. But a Maryland judge denied the couple's filing, ruling in 2010 that the divorce could not be recognized under the current state constitution. The ""same sex marriage in which parties hereto participated is not valid pursuant to Maryland law,"" the judge said. ""To recognize the alleged marriage would be contrary to public policy of Maryland."" Port and Cowan appealed, and the justices unanimously ordered the county court to grant the divorce, saying that ""a valid out-of-state same-sex marriage should be treated by Maryland courts as worthy of divorce."" Gay rights group praised the ruling. ""There are many same-sex spouses who married elsewhere who now live in Maryland,"" said National Center for Lesbian Rights Legal Director Shannon Minter. ""This ruling ensures that they have all the same rights as any other married couple in Maryland. This is a powerful decision that will provide enormous security and protection to thousands of families."" Susan Sommer, director of constitutional litigation at Lambda Legal, said, ""The high court of Maryland confirmed today in this divorce case that out-of-state marriages of same-sex couples are entitled to legal recognition under longstanding principles of comity, allowing this couple the same access to a divorce as other married couples whose relationships have ended."" While the case highlights state differences in the recognition of same-sex marriages, analysts have said it will probably have little influence outside Maryland because federal law allows states to ignore how other states define marriage. ""This is simply going to be a case about the Maryland state constitution,"" said Mark A. Graber, a law professor at the University of Maryland School of Law. Gay rights activists say the matter often leaves same-sex couples in legal limbo when moving between states, claiming that Maryland state courts have also inconsistently ruled on issues relating to same-sex marriages. ""Divorce is never easy, but when a couple has made the decision to end their marriage, there is no reason why the state should prevent them from ending their legal relationship and moving on with their lives,"" said Erik Olvera, a spokesman for the National Center for Lesbian Rights. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley signed into law a bill that allowed same-sex couples to wed. The law, however, isn't scheduled to take effect until January 1. The measure's opponents have pledged to challenge it by holding a referendum during November's election. The Maryland Marriage Alliance group says it's gathered thousands of signatures and is approaching the threshold required to put the issue on the ballot, adding further uncertainty to the Port and Cowan case. ""If anything, it shows the nuttiness of the interim period,"" Graber said of the unclear nature of Maryland state law in apparent transition. A recent public opinion poll conducted by Annapolis-based firm OpinionWorks found that a slight majority of residents would vote for repealing the new law. Of those responding, 43% ""would vote to make same-sex marriage illegal in Maryland, while 40% would vote to make it legal,"" the poll said. The poll had a sampling error of plus or minus 4%. ""Although this result is within the poll's margin of error, it is the intensity of feeling among same-sex marriage opponents that causes the overall result to lean slightly towards repeal,"" said Steve Raabe, OpinionWorks president. Currently, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In February, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill into law that legalizes same-sex marriage, but it does not take effect until June. Opponents there have pledged to block the bill, also calling for a referendum. Five states -- Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey and Rhode Island -- allow civil unions that provide rights similar to marriage. North Carolina residents voted this month to outlaw same-sex marriage, which was already prohibited in the state. A 1996 federal law known as the Defense of Marriage Act would not force states to recognize same-sex marriages allowed in other states. That law -- now being challenged in federal court -- was not the case in the current dispute, the Maryland high court said. ""Some states have elected not to recognize valid foreign same-sex marriages for purposes of domestic divorce proceedings,"" the court said. ""Those states, unlike Maryland, expressed clear public policies."" CNN Legal Affairs Producer Bill Mears contributed to this report.","The appeal involves a couple married in California .

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis is a first in many ways. He's the first Latin American pontiff; the first Jesuit; the first Francis -- and the first non-European in 1,272 years. The last time someone from outside Europe led the Roman Catholic Church was the year 741. That's when Pope Gregory III, born in Syria, ended his 10-year reign. Before him, there were popes from Bethlehem (St. Evaristus, from 97 to 105), Jerusalem (Pope Theodore I, from 642 to 649) and modern-day Libya (Saint Victor I, from 189 to 199). And, of course, the church counts Peter, disciple of Jesus from the Holy Land, as the first pope. Several other Syrians have also served as pontiff. The majority of popes have been Italian. Over the centuries, the length of reign has varied widely. Pope Pius IX reigned the longest, more than 31 years, from 1846 to 1878. See the longest-reigning popes .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned a suicide bombing Monday at a military airfield, the latest incident in a spike in violence after the burning of Qurans by NATO troops last week. At least nine people were killed and 12 wounded in the early-morning explosion near the front gate of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force base at Jalalabad airport in eastern Afghanistan, according to Gen. Abdulla Hazim Stanikzai, the provincial police chief. There were no NATO casualties. The Taliban insurgency said the attack was in retaliation for the Quran burning and said it hoped the attacks will continue ""with the anger of the public."" Another attack of ""some significance"" was reported later Monday in Naranghar province, near the Pakistani border, said Lt. Cmdr. James Williams, an ISAF spokesman. A statement from the Taliban said its fighters also attacked U.S. troops and border police in southern Naranghar on Monday evening, claiming to have inflicted a dozen deaths on the U.S. and Afghan force while losing five of their own. But Williams said that while some insurgent casualties had been reported, there were no deaths among allied troops. The Qurans that were burned were among religious materials seized from a detainee facility at Bagram Airfield last week. U.S. President Barack Obama apologized to Karzai last week, calling the burning an inadvertent error. In a statement issued on the bombing Monday, Karzai condemned the ""inhuman and un-Islamic"" act and urged that ""the ruthless enemy would earn nothing but growing public hatred and punishment before Allah, the Almighty."" Gen. John Allen, commander of NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said insurgents tried to attack the ISAF installation and failed, instead taking more innocent lives. The Taliban also claimed Monday to be behind the poisoning of food at a dining facility at Forward Operating Base Torkham, near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. It too was a retaliatory attack, the group said. ISAF confirmed that food at the base appeared to have been contaminated over the weekend, though it was unclear whether it was deliberate. ""Nobody got sick. A dining facility worker came to his leaders at the FOB and said that something had been poisoned,"" said Maj. David Eastburn, an ISAF spokesman. ""The dining facility was shut down, and we brought in environmental health, who found traces of chlorine bleach in the coffee and fruit. Soldiers are now eating pre-prepared rations, and no one was affected. There is a full investigation that is narrowing down who was responsible."" Capt. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman in Kabul, said it's not clear whether the incident was a deliberate attempt to poison troops or ""was just inadvertent, perhaps using more Clorox in the cleaning process than they should have."" The Taliban has frequently exaggerated its claims or claimed responsibility for attacks that later turned out to be the work of another group. Even so, Monday's bombing and news of the contaminated food come on the heels of a week of violent protests over the Quran burning. The violence has left at least 39 people dead, including four American soldiers, and hundreds more wounded. In northern Kunduz province over the weekend, protesters attacked a police chief's office and a U.S. military base, authorities said. Some threw hand grenades at the base, known as Combat Outpost Fortitude, with resulting blasts wounding seven U.S. personnel believed to be Special Forces members, they said. Demonstrations outside the United Nations office in Kunduz on Saturday left four civilians dead and prompted the U.N. mission there to say Monday that it is temporarily relocating its international staff. Two U.S. soldiers were gunned down last week at a base in eastern Afghanistan by a man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform. Allen pulled military advisers from Afghan ministries after Saturday's shooting deaths of two other U.S. officers inside the heavily secure Ministry of Interior. Authorities are searching for the suspect, identified by Afghan police as a junior officer in the ministry's intelligence department. The suspect had been fired by the Interior Ministry but rejoined the intelligence services as a driver a couple of months ago, a senior Afghan counterterrorism official said Monday. ""We do not know how he was allowed into the office, as the command and control center requires a password for access,"" said the official, who is not authorized to speak to the media about the topic. ""There is something fishy there."" The official said he believed that the gunman used a silencer on his weapon, as no one heard the gunshots. He said he doubts that an angry exchange led to the shooting, because the ""way he entered was not accidental."" Kirby said it's not clear whether the shooting was linked the the Quran burning. ""We don't know what the motivation was behind the murders, and we don't know all the facts surrounding how this individual got into this space and frankly was able to get out as quickly and apparently as easily as he did,"" Kirby said Monday. Allen has told his commanders he will not authorize the return of personnel to Afghan ministries until new security measures are in place and working, according to an official who has access to the latest intelligence and is involved in administration discussions but declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the situation. The religious materials, including Qurans, were removed from a detainee center library at Bagram Airfield because they had ""extremist inscriptions"" on them and there was ""an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications,"" a military official said. The ensuing attacks have put pressure on already strained U.S.-Afghan relations at a time when the United States is working to reduce troop levels and transition security as part of its plan to withdraw by 2014. Pentagon officials on Monday acknowledged the significance of the attacks but denied they are affecting the U.S. or NATO mission there. ""These events, they're troubling. They're worrisome. They've gotten everybody's attention,"" Kirby said. ""Yes, tension is high here in Kabul right now, but across the country at large, the mission continues, and we're seeing the protest activity decline."" The number of protests in Afghanistan has gone from 24 on Saturday to three on Monday, only two of which were because of the Quran burning, Kirby said. CNN's Barbara Starr and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","A suicide bomber targeted a NATO base, an official says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Police in Los Angeles and Philadelphia dismantled tents and arrested Occupy protesters who refused to leave city property early Wednesday. Los Angeles police moved in at 12:30 a.m. About an hour later, the City Hall lawn was cleared and closed for cleanup. About 200 people were arrested in the operation, which utilized some 1,400 officers, said Police Chief Charlie Beck. Police described the operation as fairly peaceful, and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa early Wednesday praised officers' professionalism. The Los Angeles encampment, which has been in place for some 60 days, had become the largest one remaining after police raided New York's Zuccotti Park on November 15 and dismantled the nearly two-month-old camp there. In Philadelphia, 52 people were arrested, said police spokeswoman Christine O'Brien. The evictions at Dilworth Plaza came about 1 a.m., Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said in a statement. Scuffles broke out after police ordered some protesters to clear the street, CNN affiliate WPVI said. O'Brien said police remained at the scene Wednesday, and the plaza was being cleaned. WPVI reported several streets were closed until further notice. Four people were injured, Nutter said in the written statement. One police officer sustained a shoulder injury, another cut his hand while making arrests, and a third cut his leg while taking down a tent. A protester was injured when a police horse stepped on her toe, O'Brien said, and was taken to a hospital. On Monday, Nutter gave protesters camped at Dilworth Plaza a 48-hour notice to vacate the site, citing a pending construction project. With the Los Angeles and Philadelphia evictions, Occupy encampments remained in a handful of cities including San Francisco; Asheville, North Carolina; Oklahoma City; and Washington, according to media reports and websites set up by the movement in some cities. In Los Angeles, officers in riot gear and armed with batons closed off streets around City Hall, using bullhorns to warn scores of agitated Occupy LA protesters to disperse. ""This has been declared to be an unlawful assembly. You have seven minutes to gather your belongings and decide to leave,"" one officer said. During the raid, more than a dozen protesters sat in a tight circle in the middle of the park with their arms linked. Some cried. Some wore masks. A white police truck drove through the center of the park, announcing orders to disperse in English and Spanish. Some campers left willingly. One carried a skateboard under one arm and what looked like a rolled-up sleeping bag in the other. Officers were met with profanity but no violence. ""This is what a police state looks like!"" some of the protesters chanted. Villaraigosa said the police action was ""a measured approach to enforcing the park closure."" On Sunday, he gave the group a 12:01 a.m. Monday deadline to take down their camp, saying ""an encampment on City Hall grounds is simply not sustainable indefinitely."" But the protesters held their ground. Four people were arrested, but police pulled back. The demonstrators sought a federal court injunction to block their removal, claiming that enforcement of the city's ""anti-camping"" provision is left up to the whim of the police. The City Council has ""expressly affirmed"" that the demonstrators are within their First Amendment rights, their complaint said, and Villaraigosa, in ordering them to leave, overstepped his authority. The case remained pending Wednesday. In announcing the Wednesday police raid, the mayor said the park will be closed, and then reopened to ""all Angelenos to exercise their First Amendment rights."" The protesters are welcome back, but they cannot camp out -- the same arrangement as at New York's Zuccotti Park. The Occupy Wall Street movement that began in New York in September has spread across major cities worldwide as a call to action against the unequal distribution of wealth. In recent weeks, cities have begun clearing encampments, citing economic, health and public safety concerns. While only a handful of protesters remained at Zuccotti Park, hundreds meet on a regular basis in the atrium of a building on Wall Street. One problem faced by the Occupy movement is that its tactics ""are really costly to themselves,"" meaning its members, said Michael Heaney, a University of Michigan professor who studies social movements. ""Basically what they've done is, they've built a movement around a tactic that requires a high level of commitment on the part of its members"" in terms of arrests and legal action or perhaps having their property confiscated. That tactic -- camping in public spaces -- can succeed for a while, he said, ""but the police will inevitably crack down."" In order to survive, he said, the Occupy movement needs to adopt some other tactics in order to change the system through internal pressure, not just external pressure, he said. Those might include lobbying, for instance. The civil rights movement, he said, used tactics such as marches and sit-ins, but also formulated a legal strategy and lobbied for the Civil Rights Act. But in the Occupy movement, it's precisely the current tactic that has inspired people, he said, making it tough for the movement to reorient itself. In addition, members have ideological reasons to reject alternative tactics, he said. ""The people that are at the heart of the Occupy movement are more committed to their way of organizing than they are to achieving the policy goals they say they support,"" Heaney said. ""... They care more about doing social action in the way they want to do it,"" meaning a non-hierarchical, ""leaderless"" approach. In addition, he noted, policy change in the United States can take decades -- allowing gays and lesbians to serve in the military, for example. ""In order to achieve policy change, you need institutions and interests committed over a period of several decades to bringing about those changes."" Still, the Occupy movement has been ""the most successful anarchist movement in history,"" he said, and is able to organize people effectively. But, he said, it's hard to see a clear path to its next stage.

"Chandrapur, India (CNN) -- My latest film, ""Mary Kom"" is about to hit the screens. In it, I play quite literally one of India's strongest women -- the only woman boxer to have won a medal in each one of the six world championships. Her's is an inspiring story of a young woman who fought odds that were heavily stacked against her to achieve her dreams. She came from a small town but never let the lack of opportunities or any form of discrimination stop her. With her story still ringing in my head, I set off to a small village near Chandrapur in India's Maharashtra state on International Youth Day at the behest of UNICEF to visit a new generation of strong young Indian women with some very inspiring stories. The girls I met are part of the Building Young Futures program, or Deepshikha as it is locally known, run in partnership with UNICEF, Barclays and the Government of Maharashtra. The program is determined to challenge the difficulties many girls face across India, providing them with the knowledge and skills required to become strong financially independent women and also very importantly, to become the agents for change and development in their communities. Bursting with potential . In my eight years as a UNICEF Ambassador championing the cause of adolescent girls, I am so proud of the work we've been able to do together. I passionately believe that young people are bursting with potential, that they can transform society. But they need help. We need to urgently invest in their future and help them realize their potential and I am determined to help make that happen. Consider the numbers and you will see why this is such a critical requirement: There are approximately 1.2 billion adolescents in the world today, according to the United Nations, of which 243 million of them are in India. I remember the dreams I had when I was a teenager. With support, opportunities and a lot of hard work I've been able to make them happen. But I know that many youngsters aren't so lucky. In Maharashtra, like many other states in India, girls are held back by not completing education, early marriage, ignorance around health issues, and lacking financial understanding and a voice for decision making. We owe them a better life, which in itself will have a positive impact on our nation and society as a whole. If we can educate more girls, provide them with employment opportunities and give them the right life skills, their world will open up! Girls transformed . As I sat in a circle with a group of girls playing a team game about working together and sharing responsibilities, delegating and planning, I could see the true impact of this program. Games like these, alongside Barclays volunteers sharing their financial knowledge, are what help the girls plan, set up and develop their own enterprises. At the end of the session, the girls came together to sing an anthem created especially for them about how ""they are taking charge."" I had goose pimples just listening to the power and determination in their voices. They had overcome so many hardships and yet they were ready to take on new challenges and improve the quality of life for themselves and everyone around them. I was truly inspired. I was invited to their marketplace to see the businesses some of the girls have set up with their new found business and saving skills -- making bags, saris and sanitary napkins -- each a story of a girl transformed, taking charge of her life and starting something of larger social relevance. It was a shopping trip with a difference. So what are the ingredients for a strong girl? How can we make sure that ""all girls and boys can make their own name and fate and be independent,"" as one girl told me. Here's my list: . • Teach a young adult not what to think but how to think . • Encourage young people to dare to believe, to realize dreams . • Foster a young girls confidence to voice her own opinions and solve her own problems . • Instill an understanding of saving, money and business to become financially independent . • Nurture an interest in their community so their impacts can be shared . Alongside all this, add a bit of magic, encouraging the girls to share their new power and use it to do good for the community. These girls go out and teach other girls and the ripple of empowerment spreads. It's a real, tangible, positive effect where is there for all to see. Walking along a path in this quiet village in the middle of nowhere, it is easy to see how a girl can get lost -- lost for life. I was there to meet Sadhana, 23, who had invited me into her home. She was far from lost. One of five sisters, her parents had initially been indifferent and felt burdened by them. The girls were not expected to have a future. Her father was paralyzed and was not able to take care of the family and that's where his young daughter stepped in. Today Sadhana provides for her parents and her family by saving and building a tailoring business herself, as well as doing much good in her village. Her strength is palpable. As I was leaving, her father told me she had become the son he never had. I replied that he didn't need a son, he already had his daughters! Sadhana told me she learned that she ""cannot do anything sitting at home,"" that she must ""come out and take charge of my own destiny."" I thought that was a great message for young people everywhere on International Youth Day. With programs like Building Young Futures, these positive stories and messages will only grow in number.","Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra traveled to western India for International Youth Day .

"(CNN) -- Captain Thomas Hudner traveled to North Korea with hopes of finding the remains of an old friend shot down more 60 years ago during the Korean War. Instead, he returned home with an offer of talks for the U.S. government. Leader Kim Jong Un is said to have been personally moved by Hudner's story and has ordered his military to do all they can to help find his comrade's remains. A surprising level of co-operation coming just months after Kim's regime made threats of a nuclear war with the United States. North Korea: A sneak peek through the keyhole . December 4, 1950, Hudner was wingman to the U.S. Navy's first African-American pilot, Jesse Brown. Brown was shot down deep within enemy territory and was trapped in his cockpit. Hudner risked his life -- deliberately crash landing his own plane -- to try to rescue him. Brown died on the side of a mountain in the brutal Korean winter but Hudner made him a promise he'd be back for him. Hudner did return to Korea but bad weather prevented him reaching the crash site. Despite his disappointment, Hudner says his 10 day visit has made him aspire to more. ""Our mission is just a part of a grand overall mission of preventing nuclear war and other types of war that could set us back to where we were 63 years ago."" Hudner has sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry relaying North Korea's wish to resume the joint recovery work of U.S. remains that stalled in 2005. Around 8,000 Americans are still MIA in the country but consecutive U.S. governments have frozen the search for bodies due to Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. North Korea's Kim Jong Un honors country's war veterans . In his letter, Hudner said the officials of the Korean People's Army told him ""they wish for this humanitarian mission to continue regardless of the larger political issues. These men are soldiers and professionals whom I have looked in the eyes and come to trust."" Hudner and fellow Korean War veterans were surprised by the level of respect and hospitality they received from officers of the Korean People's Army who were escorting them throughout their trip. ""Sometimes you get with groups of veterans of other nations,"" says Hudner, ""and there's a guardedness that they have. They don't want to say too much, they don't want to get too close to you but these... they're very friendly. It's almost as if we're old allies getting together."" Hudner acknowledges his hopes of this trip contributing to better relations may be naive but is considering the invitation to return to North Korea in September. An advance team sent to the Chosin or Jangjin Reservoir by the KPA was stranded by the floods last week, but the KPA believes roads and helicopter landing pads can be repaired in a couple of months. The KPA does insist though it wants a representative of the U.S. Joint P.O.W/M.I.A. Accounting Command (JPAC) to accompany any future expedition to search for Jesse Brown's remains. This would require a decision by the Obama administration to actively re-engage with North Korea.

"(CNN) -- The killings we've seen at a Connecticut elementary school, and more recently at the Boston Marathon, are fortunately rare events. Mass killings have remained at a stable level for the past two decades. But they are just the tip of a chilling violence iceberg that has titanic financial and social costs to society. More such occurrences are always around the corner. So why, despite our best social efforts, have we systematically failed to melt that malevolent iceberg? In my book ""The Anatomy of Violence,"" I argue that the answer goes well beyond gun control and is hidden away below most people's radar screen. The true culprit is bad biology. Bad brains result in bad behavior. A new body of knowledge is documenting beyond reasonable doubt that we need to put the brain on trial as a prime suspect. You've heard of neuroeconomics, and likely neurolaw. Now it's time for ""neurocriminology"" -- the application of neuroscience tools to dissect violence all the way down to its root causes. Nearly 200 twin and adoption studies have shown that a full half of aggression, crime and violence can be chalked up to genetic influences. Once genes are invoked, biological influences inevitably hold sway. Genes translate to altered brain functioning that in turn transforms behavior. More than 100 brain imaging studies have now documented structural and functional brain impairments in aggressive adolescents and violent adult offenders. Brain dysfunction is just as much a cause of crime as bad neighborhoods and poverty. Yet it has been ignored because while it's easy to see bad neighborhoods, it's harder to peer inside a person's head. By ignoring these biological influences, we are turning our backs on finding an antidote and instead face more future violence. The seeds of sin are sown early in life -- and not just by genes. Toxic early environments also worsen brain functioning. Mothers who smoke or drink during pregnancy double or triple the odds of their babies becoming violent offenders decades later, even after accounting for other social influences. Birth complications also predispose to adult violence, especially when combined with negative home environments. Born bad? Not exactly. But early biological predispositions beyond the individual's control propelling them on a flight path to violence? Absolutely. We aren't exactly what we eat, but not eating enough can make for malevolence. Poor nutrition during pregnancy almost triples the rate of antisocial personality disorder in adulthood. Children with poor nutrition at age 3 are more aggressive and antisocial in the teenage years after controlling for a host of social adversity factors. All of these early influences impair brain structure and function, and they contribute to the brain impairments we find in criminals and psychopaths in later life. Kids' brains may hold clues to future criminals . Is biology destiny? No, it's not. We can change these biological menaces that threaten to create the violent offender. We know from dozens of randomized controlled trials that medications ranging from stimulants to antipsychotics to mood stabilizers are surprisingly effective in reducing aggression in children and adolescents. There's no question that medications that reduce testosterone in adult sex offenders also diminish sexual drive and also incidents of sex offenses. Biological interventions need not be draconian, and it's never too early to stop the rot. Providing nurse visitations to poor mothers where advice is given on reducing smoking and alcohol use cuts juvenile delinquency in half 15 years later. Early environmental enrichments that include better nutrition, more exercise and cognitive stimulation from ages 3 to 5 both improves brain functioning at age 11 and also reduces crime at age 23 by 35%. We can prevent violence by enhancing early brain development and reducing exposure to toxins. While it's never too early to stop the rot, it's never too late, either. Two randomized controlled trials in England and the Netherlands have shown that supplementing the diets of young prisoners with omega-3 reduced serious offending by 35%. Omega-3 is a long-chain fatty acid critical for brain structure and function. It's not a final solution, but isn't it worth further consideration? We all too often wait until it's too late. We prefer to avoid awkward scientific findings on the biology of violence that question our concepts of free will and punishment and harken back to the bad old days of eugenics and brain lobectomies. These are the two edges of the sword that have killed off advances in violence prevention in the past decades. In my book, I argue that we should instead grasp the neuroethical nettles that threaten to choke the growth of the new field neurocriminology, recognize that there is more to crime than bad environments, and attack the brain basis to violence. If we were to promote a minimal biological baseline for the healthy brain development of every child in society to reduce the likelihood of future violence of the type we saw at Sandy Hook Elementary School, is that really eugenics? Not it's not. Better brains can make for better behavior for some, and a better future for all. More on the criminal brain: Nature vs. nurture .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Ohio's governor granted temporary reprieves to two death row inmates just hours after a federal appeals court blocked the execution of one of them -- adding to the mounting confusion over the state's capital punishment system. Lawrence Reynolds is on death row for killing his neighbor in  1994 during a robbery in suburban Cleveland. Earlier Monday, the state's attorney general's office asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow Thursday's execution of Lawrence Reynolds Jr. to go forward as scheduled. However, Gov. Ted Strickland announced he would delay Reynolds's execution until March, at the earliest. Another death row inmate, Darryl Durr, scheduled to be executed in coming weeks, also was granted a reprieve until at least April 2010. The conflicting moves came after the botched execution attempt of Romell Broom last month, which raised serious questions about the state's lethal injection procedures. ""Additional time is needed to fully conduct a thorough and comprehensive review of an alternative or backup lethal injection protocol that is in accordance with Ohio law,"" Strickland said in his announcement. No explanation was offered on why Ohio's executive branch switched its official position in such a short period of time. The state was expected to ask the Supreme Court for dismissal of the pending appeal. Reynolds was sentenced to death for beating and strangling Loretta Mae Foster, his 67-year-old neighbor, during a home invasion in suburban Cleveland. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati had blocked Reynolds' execution Monday, citing problems accessing Broom's veins in a failed execution attempt last month. Technicians tried for two hours on September 15 to find suitable veins to insert the chemicals. Strickland has delayed the execution indefinitely. Broom will get a hearing before a federal judge next month. His lawyers argue allowing a second execution attempt would be unconstitutional. Reynolds' lawyers have argued the state's lethal injection protocols violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Judges on the appeals court were at odds over the Reynolds appeal. ""Given the important constitutional and humanitarian issues at stake in all death penalty cases, these problems in the Ohio lethal injection protocol are certainly worthy of meaningful consideration,"" wrote Judge Boyce Martin. Judge Jeffrey Sutton dissented. ""Why assume an execution protocol is unconstitutional when one of the humane features of the protocol -- that the state will not continue trying to access a usable vein beyond a sensible time limit -- is being followed?""","Lawrence Reynolds Jr. was set to be executed Thursday for killing neighbor in 1994 .

"(CNN) -- Many people are wondering why there are so few clues about the fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, beginning with the lack of a distress call. This lack of a call, however, is not particularly perplexing. An aviator's priorities are to maintain control of the airplane above all else. An emergency could easily consume 100% of a crew's efforts. To an airline pilot, the absence of radio calls to personnel on the ground that could do little to help the immediate situation is no surprise. This investigation may face many parallels to Air France 447, an Airbus A330 that crashed in an area beyond radar coverage in the ocean north of Brazil in June 2009. Like the Air France plane, the Malaysia Airlines aircraft was a state-of-the-art, fly-by-wire airplane (a Boeing 777) with an excellent safety record. The Air France flight's string of events was precipitated by onboard faults that were automatically transmitted to the airline's headquarters during its final minutes. While they lacked any flight parameters, these maintenance fault messages gave key clues, though not a definitive cause of that accident, before any wreckage was found. Flight data recorders are key . The recovery of the Malaysia aircraft's flight data and cockpit voice recorders would be important in determining the cause of the accident. Flight data recorders contain data from more than 1,000 aircraft parameters, including altitude, vertical speed, airspeed, heading, control positions and parameters of the engines and most of the aircraft's onboard systems, captured several times per second. The cockpit voice recorder archives the last hours of not just cockpit voices and sounds but also all radio and onboard inter-airplane communications. A multinational team of expert investigators will be looking far beyond just the flight recorders. The detailed history of the flight crew and the airplane will be closely reviewed as well who was traveling on two reportedly stolen passports. Once the wreckage is located, an examination of the debris and its distribution will tell investigators if the airplane was intact upon impact and the angle at which it hit. Metallurgical and chemical analysis of the parts will determine the stresses and angles that caused the parts to fail, and if explosives were present. These findings of fact will drive the creation of theories by investigators about what caused the loss of the airplane and its passengers. As an example of investigators' capabilities, we can look at the case of Pan Am 103, a B-747 brought down over Scotland in December 1988. Investigators were able to identify in amazing detail the sequence of events and even the individual suitcase and radio that held the explosives that destroyed the airplane. Opinion: When passenger jets mysteriously disappear . Difficulty of the search . Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's route heading north from Kuala Lumpur was over sparsely populated and heavily forested mountainous areas of Malaysia and the Gulf of Thailand. Reports of a possible course reversal observed on radar could be the result of intentional crew actions but not necessarily. During Air France 447's 3Â½-minute descent to the Atlantic Ocean, it too changed its heading by more than 180 degrees, but it was an unintentional side effect as the crew struggled to gain control of the airplane. The distance between the north shore of Malaysia and the southern shore of Vietnam of 250 miles is about equal to the distance between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The flight's last telemetry data, as reported by flightaware.com, shows the airplane at 35,000 feet. Even with a dual engine failure, a Boeing 777 is capable of gliding about 120 miles from that altitude. This yields a search area roughly the size of Pennsylvania, with few clues within that area where remains of the aircraft might be. The visual search for any pieces of the airplane that may be floating or visible through dense jungle is under way and indeed a daunting task. In the case of the Air France plane, it was five days of intensive searching before the first floating wreckage was found. It took nearly two years to locate the remains of the aircraft on the ocean floor 12,000 feet below, broken into thousands of pieces by the impact with the water. Location of the wreckage may be aided by underwater locator beacons on the airplane's flight recorders, if they have not been damaged in the impact like those on the French plane were. In contrast, the Gulf of Thailand has a maximum depth of only 260 feet, with the average being about 150 feet. If the aircraft is in the water, it should make recovery easier than the long and expensive effort to bring up key parts of the Air France plane from the 2Â½-mile deep ocean, where most of the airplane and many of its victims remain. The wreckage of the Air France flight was located in April 2011, with the flight recorders recovered and analyzed that May. The cause of the crash was the crew's loss of control of the airplane after the speed sensor probes became clogged while flying through a storm in the tropics. It caused the loss of reliable airspeed indications, the autopilot to disconnect and the flight controls to degrade. The investigation of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be sure to take many months, if not years. We will know the truth of what happened when the aircraft is found and the recorders and wreckage are analyzed. In the meantime, speculation is often inaccurate and unproductive. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bill Palmer.","Pilot Bill Palmer: It's not surprising that there was no distress call from Flight 370 .

"(CNN) -- Human Rights Watch on Thursday issued a first-person account of the incarceration and torture in Bangladesh of one of its consultants -- an outspoken human rights advocate, journalist and blogger. Tasneem Khalil holds his baby in an undated family photo. ""The Torture of Tasneem Khalil: How the Bangladesh Military Abuses Its Power Under the State of Emergency,"" recounts Khalil's 22-hour incarceration last May in the southern Asian country. Khalil was blindfolded and taken at gunpoint from his home in front of his wife and infant child, according to the account. He was beaten and threatened during the ordeal, retold in the 39-page report. Human Rights Watch says the report ""highlights abuses under the country's state of emergency and the interim government's failure to restrain the security forces."" ""I have a moral responsibility to tell this story,"" said Khalil, who has done free-lance reporting for news organizations including CNN. ""I'm going to tell my story again and again and again,"" Khalil told CNN. ""It's not only my story."" Khalil is one of tens of thousands of people, the report says, who have been detained by security forces after a government with a ""reform agenda"" came to power in January 2007. It says Khalil was punished for criticizing ""the security forces' role in extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and other abuses."" He described being taken to a small room that resembled a ""torture cell"" and being severely beaten. Then his interrogators took off his blindfold to have him write a ""confession"" of his crimes. ""I was sitting in front of a table and three batons were on the table along with some stationery. One was a wooden baton, about a meter long. The other two were covered with black plastic. Poking out of the end of these two were metal wires,"" Khalil recounted. ""I'm not sure if they used electricity on me. The pain often came like shocks, but they were hitting me so hard that I'm not sure whether it was just the force that hurt like this or if it was electricity."" Khalil is now a consultant for Human Rights Watch in Sweden, which gave him and his family asylum after the ordeal. ""Rampant illegal detention and torture are clear evidence of Bangladesh's security forces running amok,"" said Brad Adams, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch who was quoted in a news release about the report. ""Tasneem Khalil's prominence as a critical journalist may have prompted his arrest, but it also may have saved his life. Ordinary Bangladeshis held by the security forces under the emergency rules have no such protections."" Khalil was freed ""after tremendous international and national pressure,"" the group said. Human Rights Watch is calling for the government in Bangladesh ""to make the protection of human rights as much of a priority as its fight against corruption."" ""While few would dispute that corruption, organized crime, politicization of the bureaucracy and political violence had to be addressed in Bangladesh, the interim government must realize that reform cannot be built on midnight knocks on the door and torture,"" said Adams. ""A peaceful democratic society requires respect for basic rights."" Adams said there have been ""no serious attempts"" to hold people accountable for torture and arbitrary detentions. It urged the international community to persuade the government to deal with these matters. ""The security forces have been arbitrarily detaining and torturing people, but there have been no serious attempts at holding those responsible for these criminal acts to account,"" said Adams. ""Why hasn't the government made the protection of Bangladeshis from this scourge a priority? Are they reformers, or do they just say they are reformers?"" Bangladesh government officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Khalil, contacted in Sweden by CNN, said he wants justice for himself and the many others who have gone through the same ordeal. ""I absolutely want to see the people responsible for my torture and for my detention tried in a court of law in a transparent way. I want justice,"" he said. At the same time, he said, ""I am fully aware this is not going to happen"" at this time, given the mindset of the government. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Iranian authorities on Tuesday released one of three people detained along with Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian last week, a source close to the family of the released detainee told CNN on Wednesday. The released detainee is the husband of an Iranian-American photojournalist who remains in custody with Rezaian and his wife, according to the source. Authorities have yet to identify the photojournalist, and Iranian officials have yet to explain why the journalists were detained. According to The Washington Post, Rezaian, 38, holds American and Iranian citizenship. He has been the paper's Tehran correspondent since 2012. His wife, Yeganeh Salehi, is an Iranian citizen who has applied for U.S. permanent residency. She is a correspondent for the UAE-based newspaper the National, The Post said. Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, the director general of the Tehran Province Justice Department, has been quoted by Iran's official IRNA news agency as saying that a ""Washington Post journalist has been detained for some questions and after technical investigations, the judiciary will provide details on the issue."" He did not specify on what grounds the correspondent, whom he did not name, was being held. Iranian security forces are vigilant about all kinds of enemy activities, Esmaili added, according to IRNA. Rights activists and fellow journalists have condemned the arrests of the journalists and demanded their release. According to research by the Committee to Protect Journalists, there are 35 journalists in prison in Iran. Rezaian's mother made a videotaped plea for the release of her son and daughter-in-law Tuesday. She warned that his health would be compromised without medication for high blood pressure. ""I do not know where my son and daughter-in-law are,"" Rezaian's mother said in a video clip posted on the Washington Post's website. ""As a mother, I am extremely worried about their well-being."" Rezaian's mother noted that her son's love for Iran ""is so infectious that he has made a career out of sharing its beauty with others."" ""Since he was a little boy, my son loved Iran. Jason moved to Iran to live and work full-time,"" she said."" ""I love my son and daughter, and I am proud of their commitment to journalism. I know their standards for truth and excellence in journalism guide them both professionally and personally. I humbly ask those who continue to detain my son and daughter to please release them and allow our family to be reunited and my fears for their safety to subside."" In a statement Thursday, Washington Post foreign editor Douglas Jehl said, ""we are deeply troubled by this news and are concerned for the welfare of Jason, Yeganeh and two others said to have been detained with them.""

"(CNN) -- A San Francisco man accused of possessing bomb-making materials in his apartment also bought lethal toxins online, the FBI said in documents unsealed Friday. Ryan Kelly Chamberlain II was charged this week with possession of an illegal destructive device. Bomb technicians found a series of items in his house, leading to a manhunt that ended with his arrest Monday. Items included a powdery, green explosive substance, a model rocket motor, ball bearings and an igniter for home-made bombs, according to a different affidavit unsealed earlier this week. It did not list deadly toxins at the time. But the latest documents detail lethal poisons bought anonymously in dark, encrypted corners of the Web. ""The investigation has revealed that Chamberlain has utilized an anonymous, Internet-based market place known as Black Market Reloaded to facility the unlawful acquisition and possession of biological agents and lethal toxins in California and Florida,"" FBI agent Michael Eldridge wrote in the latest documents. Chamberlain bought abrin from a seller in Sacramento in December, the documents allege. He said he planned to use the poison to ""ease the suffering"" of cancer patients, according to the documents. Abrin is a natural poison found in the rosary pea plant. It's similar to ricin, but has never been used in terrorist attacks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, he allegedly bought ground rosary peas and pure nicotine in December and June of last year, respectively. Nicotine can be used to poison food and water, according to the CDC. Chamberlain, 42, was arrested near the Golden Gate Bridge after a three-day manhunt. It's unclear if he's entered a plea.

"(CNN) -- It might not be the biggest blunder in ""Wheel of Fortune"" history, but it just might be podium worthy. Recently a contestant named Stephen rang in first during one of the Toss Ups, where one by one, letters are revealed until a contestant buzzes in and takes a guess. The category was Song Lyrics. ""S--F C--Y -ERE WE COME."" Stephen's guess was ""Surf Clay Where We Go."" Where? Go? Really? To which host Pat Sajak said, bluntly, ""Uh, no,"" while probably thinking, ""What the bleep is surf clay?"" We're guessing Stephen is not a fan of Jan and Dean and not familiar with the classic ""Surf City, Here We Come."" TMZ tracked down Stephen, last name Dryer, who told the website that in his rush to buzz in he panicked and forgot the category. As Dryer pointed out, it's not like he flubbed three puzzles like a student did in April during a college week episode. That man, Julian Batts, even blew one round in which every letter could be seen. He mispronounced Achilles, to the benefit of the next contestant. Dyer told TMZ he was going to take the $7,200 he won and use part of it to go on a cruise. We hope they don't run into any surf clay.

"(CNN) -- Neighbors had been complaining for a while about the dreadful smell coming from William Buchman's house in Santa Ana, California. ""The stench is overwhelming,"" said Forest Long, Jr., who lives nearby in the Orange County city. Long said friends were becoming reluctant to visit because of the nasty odor in the area. ""It smells like something's dead,"" he told CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS. The neighbors' complaints prompted an investigation by the Department of Animal Services. And when authorities raided Buchman's two-story house Wednesday, they discovered the cause of the putrid odor. Vast numbers of snakes -- some alive, most of them dead and decaying. In some cases, only the skins remained. Mice and rats were also in abundance. Acting on a search warrant, police and animal services officers wearing protective suits and masks searched the house, finding dirty rooms full of stacks of plastic bins containing pythons. Police said ""several hundred snakes"" were believed to be in Buchman's home. In just one room, they found more than 50 dead pythons and seven live ones, KCAL/KCBS reported. ""They're very cold and it appears that most of them haven't eaten in quite a while,"" Animal Services Cpl. Sondra Berg told the local broadcaster. ""There's various stages of dying and dead and underweight."" Police said Buchman, a 53-year-old teacher, has been arrested and booked on suspicion of animal cruelty. He has not yet appeared in court or been formally charged. CNN has not been able to determine whether Buchman has legal counsel, and has not yet been able to contact anyone representing him for comment.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- A female foreign tourist was kidnapped, raped and robbed on a minibus in Rio de Janeiro, police said, highlighting security concerns in the Brazilian city that will host matches in the 2014 World Cup and will put on the Summer Olympics two years later. A male foreign tourist on the minibus was also held captive and robbed, according to Rio police. Police said they would not release the identities or nationalities of the victims, but the U.S. Embassy said Monday that one of the two is an American citizen, and a U.S. State Department official on Monday said the woman raped was a U.S. citizen. The U.S. Consulate is in contact with the victim and is providing all appropriate consular assistance, said the State Department official, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to talk about the case. In general, consular assistance includes ensuring access to medical care, working closely with law enforcement authorities, assisting in understanding the local criminal justice process, and following any criminal proceedings very closely, the official said. The consulate also communicates with family members in the United States, and helps provide U.S.-based resources for the victim when possible, the official said. The two boarded the minibus in the Copacabana beach district in Rio de Janeiro early Saturday. Three men subsequently boarded the minibus and forced all the other passengers off, police said. The woman was raped, and the two passengers' credit cards were used at multiple locations inside and outside of Rio de Janeiro over a span of hours, the police said in a statement. According to Brazilian newspapers, the man was handcuffed and beaten, while the woman was repeatedly raped. The two were dumped in Itaborai, a city more than 30 miles (about 50 kilometers) away, after six hours, O Globo newspaper said. According to Rio police, two men have been arrested -- Jonathan Foudakis de Souza, 20, and Wallace Aparecido Souza Silva, 22. They are searching for a third man in relation to the crime. They said a Brazilian woman who was raped a week earlier has also identified the suspects. Rio de Janeiro has launched a citywide offensive against crime, particularly drug-fueled violence in the shantytowns. Police, backed by army troops, have stormed the slums, hoping to seize control from gangs and help secure the city before many high-profile events begin this year. Pope Francis' first big international trip will be to Rio in July when he is expected to lead millions of young people in celebration of World Youth Day. Rio de Janeiro also will stage many of the key matches when Brazil hosts the World Cup next year, and it will be the host city for the Olympic Games in 2016. Rio has gone a long way toward cleaning up its image as one of Latin America's most violent cities. But Brazilian media already are drawing parallels between this attack and the infamous gang rape of a young woman on a bus in India.","NEW: U.S. State Dept official says rape victim was female U.S. citizen .

"New York (CNN) -- The son of a founder of the Palestinian militant group, Hamas, Tuesday told CNN that he was a spy for Israel. For 10 years, Mosab Yousef said he gathered information about Hamas terrorist plots and fed them to Israel's domestic security service Shin Bet. Yousef, in an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, said he did it because he came to believe that Hamas was practicing ""exceptional cruelty"" against its members and ""killed people for no reason."" He has now written a book, ""Son of Hamas"" detailing his exploits from his new base in the United States where he has lived since 2007. CNN could not independently confirm his story and Israel has refused to comment. In the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, a former Israeli handler said of Yousef: ""One insight of his was worth 1,000 hours of thought by top experts."" Yousef told CNN: ""They offered me to work for them. My goal was to be a double agent and attack them from the inside."" But then his views changed. Watch the full interview here . ""After I was tortured by Shin Bet I was transferred to prison [where] Hamas tortured Hamas members and I became confused who was really my enemy ... I accepted to meet Shin Bet."" Yousef said he agreed to spy on Hamas and that his decision was partly a moral one. ""My people did not understand this. Shin Bet is committed to a constitution but Hamas targets civilians. There's a difference between targeting a terrorist and civilians."" He said that in part his transformation was due to spiritual reasons. ""Later on, I became a Christian, during that time, the first few months, and I was convinced by the principle of loving your enemies. And I saw that my enemy, who I thought that they were my enemies, they had morality, they had their responsibilities more than my own people."" He added: ""As a Shin Bet agent, when I had information I helped arrest people, otherwise they hit randomly. When I specified a particular person I had a condition - not to kill that person ... ""In 10 years working for Shin Bet I am not responsible for killing one terrorist. I care about my people, my problem was their [Hamas'] ideology. His father, Sheikh Yousef, is serving time in an Israeli prison. He recently wrote a letter from jail saying that the whole family ""inclusively and exhaustively denounce our eldest son."" An attorney for the elder Yousef obtained a statement last week from the father saying Hamas knew of his son's contact with Israeli intelligence and adding that he ""was not on any day an active member in the ranks of Hamas."" Asked if he feels in danger because of what he's done, Yousef says he is not afraid. ""Death is not the worst thing that can happen to a human being, physical death. The worst, spiritual and soul death. This is what really scares me."" The Israeli government, including Shin Bet, has not offered CNN official comment, and his family has broadly denied his story. But an intelligence source told Amanpour that the core claims are true, this is a ""modus operandi of how Israeli agents work,"" to penetrate the opposite side, to try to get as much information as possible. But the source added some of the high profile claims of thwarting terrorism or helping with high-level captures are ""gross exaggerations.""","The son of a Hamas leader says he spied for Israel for 10 years .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- How to make money from ballet is a question puzzling many art executives around the world, but one dance group in South Africa is hoping that a new initiative will help keep its curtains from closing for good. South African Mzansi Ballet (SAMB) is a Johannesburg-based professional ballet company comprising both classical and contemporary dancers. But it hasn't received any government funding for the last 12 years and is struggling to make ends meet. Angela Malan, ballet mistress at SAMB, says that running the company with very little financial support is not easy. ""It's a fight all the time,"" she explains. ""Business is business -- you have to pay the bills, you have to pay the salaries. So we have to do whatever it takes to make this business and this product sellable and good."" To do exactly that, SAMB joined forces with students from Harvard Business School (HBS) visiting South Africa as part of their Field Immersion Experiences for Leadership Development program, which aims to help HBS students increase their practical experience in the business world. Last month, six business administration students from HBS visited SAMB for two weeks to conduct research and find ways to improve the marketing of the ballet company. ""It's a fantastic opportunity for us to really get out into the world and see how people run businesses outside of the classroom,"" says Jonathan Herbert, one of the students. And as the students gain practical experience, the directors of the ballet company gain marketing advice on how to turn their art form into a sustainable business. ""There are a lot of people out there who are a potential target audience and who are potential target revenue and what's important is just finding ways of capturing it,"" says Herbert. ""So you're selling experience,"" adds Rie Yamamoto, also one of the HBS students. ""It's not just a posture you're selling. ""It's not about tutus or the shoes or whatever; it's this special feeling that you feel when you go see the performance; it's about the music, it's about the whole new world that you see on stage and that's exactly what you're selling. It's just the feeling that you get at the theater, so that's exactly your product."" Watch video: Investing in the arts . But apart from simply selling ballet as a product, Harvard professor Sandra Sucher believes that dance companies have to be business savvy to market professional ballet successfully. She says it's all about taking off your tutu and putting on your business hat. ""I think that there is a discipline to learning how to run yourself as a business organization that is important for an arts company regardless of whether they have government funding,"" says Sucher. Dirk Badenhorst, chief executive of SAMB, says it costs about $2 million to run a ballet company in South Africa, and ticket sales cannot cover all the costs. ""We recoup about a third of our running costs through ticket sales,"" says Badenhorst. For the other two thirds, the ballet company has to rely on generous contributions from South African dance lovers. But Badenhorst says that this is not enough and not sustainable for a long-term business plan. ""Our product, which in our case is the luxury brand of ballet, needs to be sold like any other product, because by keeping us like an arts company, you literally keep us on our knees,"" he says. During their stay in South Africa, the Harvard students conducted extended interviews with people from all walks of life to find out how to best market ballet. Herbert says they came across genuine excitement for the art form, even in unexpected places, where people little disposable income. ""When we went out to different areas of Johannesburg, certainly to some of the areas like Soweto, where we weren't expecting to find people who would be really interested in coming to see something that perhaps people have a preconceived notion is a European art form, and what was striking was that a number of those people felt that they would actually be very happy to come and see the ballet, to buy tickets,"" he explains. ""They weren't afraid of the cost of coming."" Herbert adds: ""It was a very aspirational product for them and the biggest issue was one around transport and whether or not they'll be able to get here. So it was not so much that they weren't interested, it was just that they didn't necessarily know of the way to come to the performances or know when the performances were on."" One way of combating these issues, Herbert says, is by taking the ballet to the people. Badenhorst certainly agrees. ""It's also time that we move out of our comfort zones in the big theaters and that we actually start touring again,"" he says. ""That we take the ballet to the army, to farmers to the plants of big big companies and businesses, to the real man on the street and to get them to appreciate the beauty and wonder of ballet."" Business advice given, lessons learned, this collaboration between Harvard's best and SAMB may just be what the South African ballet company needs to keep its dancers on stage.","Harvard students give business advice to ballet company in South Africa .

"(CNN) -- England may play host to the world's most lucrative football league but the country's national team is facing a fight to compete on the biggest stage of all. With just two months until the 2014 World Cup kicks off in Brazil, England manager Roy Hodgson laid bare the nature of his problems for picking a squad capable of challenging in South America. While the Premier League has gone from strength to strength and attracted some of the world's most famous players, English football has stood still. The Three Lions has only reached the semifinals once since winning the World Cup on home soil in 1966. Speaking at a news conference at Wembley Stadium, Hodgson revealed he may be forced to pick players who have not appeared regularly for their club sides this season -- claiming nearly 30% of his squad will consist of ""players who when you see their names, won't be regular players in their first team and certainly won't be first names on the team sheet."" He added: ""If you go back a long time, that would have been unthinkable. ""In my youth, it would have been unthinkable for anyone to play for England who wasn't a complete and utter star in his own team."" According to a survey recorded last season, just over a third of all players in the Premier League are eligible to represent England. The pool of players available to Hodgson has shrunk further following injuries to Arsenal's Theo Walcott and Southampton's Jay Rodriguez, who are both expected to miss the tournament. And while the talented trio of Everton's Ross Barkley, Liverpool's Raheem Sterling and Southampton's Luke Shaw have all recently emerged, Hodgson accepts that England may have to get used to its younger players being left out in the cold. ""It's a bit of a transitional period and it's something us in England will have to get used to because some of the best players that we have as young players are at the top clubs,"" he added. ""Because they're at the top clubs in the country, they're competing with the very best that the foreign market can sell to us. ""It's harder for them because they're competing with other world stars."" England was heavily criticized for its poor showing in South Africa four years ago after going out in the second round following a humiliating defeat by Germany. Fabio Capello, who coached that particular team, told CNN last month that England will never succeed at the World Cup because its players play too many games. While Hodgson accepts that Capello's assertion has some truth, he refuses to accept that tiredness will derail his team's chances of success in Brazil. ""Of course, you can't say he (Capello) is wrong in saying that but it's a fact of life we can do nothing about,"" Hodgson told CNN. ""Tournaments are played in the summer and played very, very quickly after a long season ends. We also cannot deny that the Premier League is a more intensive league than many others --it's probably the most if I'm brutally honest. ""We've got that problem to deal with but all we can do is to accept it and try not to use it as an excuse. ""We will try to do everything we can during our time together to make sure we don't treat everybody the same. ""Perhaps if a player has played more games than another or a bit more tired than another then maybe we can take that into account. ""But having said that, I'm pretty certain that's been done in the past as well. There's no guarantee that will be the ultimate solution -- but it's the only thing we can do.""","England facing struggle to compete against world's best .

"Bangkok (CNN) -- When Brazil and Croatia hit the pitch for the 2014 FIFA World Cup opener on Thursday, football fanatics in Bangkok will be forced to contend with more than an unfriendly time zone if they want to catch the action. The nationwide midnight to 4 a.m curfew, imposed by the military three weeks ago when it took over the country in a coup after months of political and social unrest, has been lifted in more than 30 provinces and districts, including Thailand's tourist hotspots such as Phuket, Pattaya, Krabi and Koh Samui. But not Bangkok. This poses a problem for the city's notoriously diehard football fans who want to watch the games with friends and fellow revelers -- many of the matches start between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. local time. ""I'm a bit worried about staying out late to watch the games, but it should be fine, as police and military aren't that strict about the curfew,"" says Wisit Konkratoke, a 33-year-old Bangkok graphic designer and a self-described huge football fan. Wisit says he doubts bars will be airing all the matches due to the curfew so he'll likely watch at a friend's house. ""Solders have stopped me after midnight on the road to ask where I'm going, and when I tell them I'm going home it's fine, they let me carry on,"" he says. Speaking to reporters last week, members of the ruling junta said they will not be lifting the curfew in the capital just so people can watch football, advising fans to go home early and cheer on their favorite teams with their families instead. Bangkok bars work around curfew . During the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Bangkok was filled with viewing parties, many offering fans giant LED screens and outdoor beer gardens. Waves of supporters dressed in the colors of their teams. (Thailand has never qualified for a World Cup.) But the time zone was friendlier then, with evening games the norm. And there was no curfew. This time around, many sports pubs are trying to find ways around the midnight-4 a.m. curfew. Some say they're planning to push their luck. Nick Wetzel, owner of The Pickled Liver, a downtown British pub frequented by Bangkok expats, says curfew enforcement varies widely from day to day, so he's unsure how things will go during the month-long football event. ""I have every intention of showing as many games as possible, depending on public demand,"" says Wetzel. ""Unfortunately, with the curfew still in place it's hard to know what to expect, especially from the police. They came to my bar at 1 a.m. this morning to close it down, so I hope this will not set a precedent for the World Cup. ""I can only hope that given the importance of the matches coupled with Thailand's love of the beautiful game, they will let us watch the tournament in peace. Only time will tell."" Other Bangkok pubs have said they'll allow patrons in only as late as midnight, then will let visitors watch behind locked doors. ""We will be open but due to the current curfew space will be limited to upstairs,"" advertises the Clubhouse Sports Bar and Grill on its website. ""Customers will need to be in before 12 and can leave at their discretion (although we would not advise it)."" Some are keeping their fingers crossed that the junta will lift the curfew. ""At present we can only show 11 p.m. games and games starting at 5 a.m, but we are hoping the curfew will be lifted Thursday,"" says a representative from Bangkok's The Sportman Bar and Restaurant, another popular haunt among expats and visiting tourists. Wichian Nunporntasak, who owns a restaurant and bar called ""Cheek"" on Bangkok's Ratchaphruek Road, says the curfew has harmed his business, though he understands why the military is concerned about keeping the city safe. ""I'm not worried about the curfew for the games at 11 p.m., I'll still air them and hope we don't get shut down before the end,"" he says. ""But I won't be able to stay open for the later matches. I'll probably have to go to a friend's house to watch them. ""The army has been nice every time I'm stopped on the road after curfew, as I explain that I'm heading home from work."" Khao San Road goes quiet . CNN visited Khao San Road this week to find out how bar owners and guest houses plan to deal with the curfew situation during the World Cup. A popular stop for backpackers thanks to the high concentration of guest houses, tour agencies, bars and restaurants in the old part of the city, the strip is usually a favorite World Cup viewing spot for the local and international football crowd. But this year, the consensus seems to be that while many bars will try to get away with airing the 11 p.m. games, that's as hard as they'll push it. Multiple bar staff told CNN that police were strictly enforcing the curfew and making bars close promptly at midnight -- though plenty of tourists continue to roam the strip after closing time. Some bars said they hadn't even bought the license to air the games, but will do so if the junta lifts the curfew soon. A staff member at Nat Guest House, who didn't want to be named, said the establishment will likely let people watch in the common area but will have to keep the noise down in consideration of guests. Brazil 2014: Will World Cup redeem people's faith in football? Junta tries to 'return happiness' with free World Cup broadcasts . On the sidelines of Thailand's political drama, confusion over just how many of the World Cup games locals will be able to watch at home played out in the courts this week. Thailand's National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) tried to force RS International, the exclusive rights holder for the FIFA World Cup, to allow Thailand's free TV channels to broadcast all of the World Cup matches. Earlier, RS won the case in Thailand's Central Administrative Court and announced it would televise only 22 World Cup matches on free TV. The rest could be viewed only through purchased TV boxes. The NBTC appealed the court's ruling but were shut down on Wednesday. On Wednesday evening, the NBTC hinted that they would subsidize the matches in line with the junta's campaign to ""return happiness to the Thai people"" so that everyone could watch all the games on free cable at home. No word on whether those who bothered to buy the boxes will be eligible for a refund.","Nationwide midnight-4 a.m. curfew lifted in many tourist destinations but not Bangkok .

"(CNN) -- After meeting Monday with six victims of sexual abuse by clergy members, Pope Francis apologized for the crimes committed against them and begged forgiveness ""for the sins of omission on the part of church leaders who did not respond adequately to reports of abuse."" Apologies are all well and good, but this one brings to mind two trite but true sayings: ""Too little, too late"" and ""Actions speak louder than words."" Unfortunately, Francis has more to do so that future popes won't have to keep saying ""I'm sorry"" for these crimes and the Catholic Church's cover-up. This is not to downplay the important symbolism of public apologies from the church's top leader. Indeed, Francis seems sincere and acknowledges the complicity of the institutional church in the cover-up, not just the actions of individual men. But Francis is not the first pope to meet with sex abuse victims or even the first to offer an official apology for what has to be one of the gravest evils in the church. His predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, met on several occasions with victims, including during a trip to the United States. After one such meeting, he also issued a formal apology, saying he was ""deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured."" In comparison, Francis' apology, given during a lengthy homily, was more extensive, emphasizing the psychological and spiritual pain victims have endured and noting that these ""despicable actions"" had been ""camouflaged with a complicity that cannot be explained."" It also was better than his, ""Yes, but ..."" apology earlier this year, when he mentioned that abusers were ""quite a few in number, though not compared to the total number"" of priests, after earlier complaining about how the church had been unfairly singled out for the problem of sexual abuse of minors. Given the enormity of this problem facing the Catholic Church, however, victims' rights groups are correct in expressing disappointment with how long it took for the new Pope to meet with them (16 months into his pontificate). In March, editors of the National Catholic Reporter, which has been covering sex abuse by clergy for nearly three decades, implored the Pope in an open letter to make meeting with victims a priority. As someone who clearly understands the significance of his actions -- everything from his choice of attire to whose feet he washes on Holy Thursday -- Francis should have met with victims much sooner than this. Still, Monday's apology seems to be part of more significant movements in the Vatican, including the naming of a victim to a new panel to address sex abuse and the recent defrocking of a Polish archbishop and papal ambassador accused of paying for sex with minors. But there is much more to be done, starting with the removal of Kansas City-St. Joseph Bishop Robert Finn, who has been found guilty of failing to report suspicions of child abuse to police or state child welfare authorities. The diocese has recently been ordered to pay $1.1 million for violating terms of an earlier contract of reparations. Of course, a good apology includes not only acknowledgment of personal and/or corporate responsibility for the victim's pain, but also a promise to fix things, or at least to not continue to inflict that pain. The church is finally, after decades of denying or minimizing victims' pain, accepting responsibility. But we're not yet there on fixing things. That's why victims' rights groups are understandably frustrated by the molasses-like pace of the church on this issue. Barbara Blaine, president of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, applauded the courage of the victims who met with Francis on Monday but complained about the need for more decisive action. ""The Pope says the church should 'make reparations' to victims. That's secondary. Stopping abuse and protecting children comes first. And sadly, no child on earth is safer today because of this meeting,"" she wrote in a statement. Here's another saying: ""To err is human; to forgive, divine."" If that's true, it will be the victims who will be the real saints, not the apologizers.","Heidi Schlumpf: Pope Francis met with victims of clergy sexual abuse, begged forgiveness .
She says apology good, but he must do more to make amends with victims, all Catholics .

"(CNN) -- There's a $33 million prize on offer -- but Arsenal's hopes of securing the cash are on the line. A goalless draw in Turkey against Besiktas in the first leg of its Champions League playoff means the pressure will be cranked up another level when the two teams face up at Emirates Stadium next Wednesday. Reduced to 10-men following the sending off of Aaron Ramsey, Arsenal will hope it can successfully see off a plucky Besiktas side and secure a 15th successive season in the group stage of Europe's top club competition. Arsenal had won all 12 of its previous playoff matches in the competition but Wenger remains confident his side will progress and secure a healthy financial reward. ""It was a difficult game played at a frenetic pace throughout,"" Wenger told ITV. ""We could have won it but they had chances as well. In the end we didn't lose and hopefully we will make it at home. ""Both yellow cards for Aaron Ramsey are unbelievable. When you see the fouls they have made today it's not serious. Just not serious."" Ramsey's sending off, which came late on following a second yellow card, rules the midfielder out of next week's second leg. And yet Arsenal still could have snatched victory with five minutes remaining when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's effort hit the post. Aiming for a place in the group stage following last year's last-16 exit, Arsenal made a slow start and could have fallen behind inside the first minute. Demba Ba, the former Newcastle and Chelsea forward, struck an effort straight from the kickoff which smashed against the crossbar. Ba then went close again, forcing Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny into a sharp save with an ambitious volley. Arsenal, which left it late to win its opening Premier League game of the season against Crystal Palace on Saturday, appeared to struggle with the poor quality of the playing surface. Both Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud wasted decent openings, while Ba fired just wide after running in behind the Arsenal defense. The second half, while just as frenetic, failed to provide a goal with neither side able to convert their chances. Olcay Sahan wasted Besiktas' best opportunity, curling his effort wide of the far post after he had worked his way into the Arsenal penalty area. With the game becoming ever more fractious, Ramsey was shown his second yellow card to leave Arsenal a man down for the remaining 10 minutes of the contest. But it was the visitors who came closest to snatching a dramatic victory when Chamberlain weaved his way past a couple of challenges before lashing his effort against the post. Elsewhere, Napoli came from behind to claim a 1-1 draw against Athletic Bilbao. Iker Muniain gave the visiting side a first-half lead before Gonzaolo Higuain leveled for the home side. In Denmark, FC Copenhagen was beaten 3-2 by Bayer Leverkusen despite having taken the lead on two separate occasions. In the night's other games, Salzburg defeated Malmo 2-1 and Steaua saw off Ludogorets 1-0.","Arsenal finish with 10-men in 0-0 draw at Besiktas .

And at the end of the day he will prevail because he is on the side of the rule of law."" Buzbee, addressing reporters at a news conference in Austin, was flanked by prominent Republican attorney Bobby Burchfield, criminal lawyer David Botsford and former Romney presidential campaign legal counsel Ben Ginsberg. A grand jury in Travis County indicted Perry last Friday on two felony counts stemming from his threat to veto funding for a statewide public integrity unit run by Travis Country District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, unless she stepped down, according to the special prosecutor in the case, Michael McCrum. The case centers on Perry's June 2013 veto of the $7.5 million budget for the unit run by Lehmberg, after she refused his demand to resign following her drunken driving arrest and conviction. Perry faces accusations of coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity in connection with the threat and veto. Perry will be booked Tuesday at the Travis County Court in Austin. He will be fingerprinted and have his mug shot taken, according to Buzbee. Perry's first court appearance is Friday. Perry's lawyers, who played video snippets of an apparently intoxicated Lehmberg in police custody, insisted the governor had a legal right to tie funding for the public integrity unit to Lehmberg's removal. Does Rick Perry's indictment disqualify him from 2016? ""Governor Perry did what anyone else would do,"" Buzbee said. ""Anyone who sees that video"" would have ""lost confidence"" in Lehmberg. That said, the lawyers argued that the governor had no legal obligation to offer any rationale for his veto, which they insisted was protected the basic constitutional principle of separation of powers. ""This is nothing more than banana republic politics"" and a ""nasty attack"" on the ""rule of law,"" Buzbee insisted. And Perry's explanation of his veto, Buzbee added, was protected under the ""right to free speech under the First Amendment."" Birchfield called the indictment ""an attempt to criminalize politics, pure and simple,"" while Ginsberg warned that it could ""set a harmful precedent in separation of powers doctrine."" It needs to be fought ""as a matter of principle,"" he said. As for Perry's looming summons, Buzbee acknowledged that ""there will of course be a point where Governor Perry will have to appear."" ""But that is not something we are going to keep you in the dark about,"" he told the reporters, possibly reflecting growing confidence among the governor's advisers that they can turn the controversy to his political advantage. So far, other prominent Republicans have rallied to Perry's defense. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the head of the Republican Governor's Association and another potential 2016 presidential candidate, issued a statement Monday declaring his ""complete faith and confidence"" in Perry's ""honesty and integrity."" And former Texas congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul on Monday called Perry's indictment ""a joke."" Asked if Texas taxpayers would pay Perry's legal bills, the team acknowledged that the public would pick up some share of the cost for his defense.

"(CNN) -- There were no shocks in the first round of the French Open Sunday, except for one: eight time champion Rafael Nadal will begin the defense of his title in the secondary Suzanne Lenglen court, a move dubbed as ""bizarre"" by one player. As world number one and reigning champion, not to mention arguably the greatest player to ever grace the clay of Roland Garros, Nadal would have expected to start his campaign -- a match against American wild card Robby Ginepri -- on the Philippe Chatrier court. But organizers decided to host Novak Djokovic versus Joao Sousa and Stan Wawrinka versus Guillermo Garcia-Lopez instead, a move which has prompted a furious reaction on social media, and amongst some players. ""That's really bizarre,"" John Isner told AFP, after the American had needed two tiebreaks to beat tough Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/4), 7-5. ""I mean, how many times does the guy have to win the tournament to be able to have his first match on Chatrier?"" Sunday's matches saw Roger Federer play in his record 58th consecutive grand slam. It was easy pickings for the 33 year old who beat Slovakia's Lukas Lacko 6-2, 6-4, 6-2. Sixth seed Tomas Berdych also won in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, against the Canadian Peter Polansky. Another Canadian, exciting young prospect Milos Raonic who came close to shocking Djokovic at the Rome Masters recently, had a slightly tougher time beating Australia's Nick Kyrgios 6-3, 7-6 (7/1), 6-3. World number one Serena Williams began her campaign with a simple 6-2, 6-1 victory against Alize Lim of France whilst sister Venus beat Switzerland's Belinda Bencic 6-4, 6-1. The action now moves on to Monday for Nadal and Djokovic. ""It's a big court, there is television, so you can put it everywhere, you know, in the world,"" said French number two Jo-Wilfried Tsonga when asked about Nadal's court allocation.

"Washington (CNN) -- The chances of immigration reform passing in the House this year were already slim before its majority leader, Eric Cantor, lost his primary on Tuesday. So, by the time Cantor announced on Wednesday that he was stepping down from his leadership post on July 31, those who oppose any type of amnesty for illegal immigrants were sounding the death knell for related legislation on Capitol Hill. In his victory speech, Dave Brat, the economics professor who defeated Cantor by double digits, cited the lawmaker's willingness to consider a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants as one of his opponent's weak flanks. And pundits said that will be a lesson to others who might dare to push for reform. ""It is a bombshell,"" CNN senior political analyst David Gergen said on CNN of Cantor's loss. ""I think it does mean more gridlock ahead, especially on immigration. Immigration reform is now dead."" Those who support such measures as granting a pathway to citizenship to Dreamers — the children of those who came to the country illegally — raced to put Cantor's defeat in context. ""Some things do not change after a primary. Even a primary result that no one, including the winning candidate, had predicted,"" Rep. Luis Gutiérrez, an Illinois Democrat and staunch immigration advocate, said on the House floor on Wednesday. ""Immigration reform is not dead. It might just be moving to the White House for action if none comes from this House."" There was always a short window in this Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation in the House before lawmakers leave for the summer in August and before the midterm elections in November, legal and political experts say. Maybe immigration reform isn't dead after all . Last year, the Senate approved a sweeping immigration reform package, including a path to citizenship for an estimated 8 million of the more than 11 million undocumented workers in the country, according to figures from the Congressional Budget Office. Though roughly one-third of Republicans supported the measure, the legislation stalled in the GOP-controlled House as lawmakers there weighed more gradual reforms. Cantor had publicly backed proposals giving Dreamers the chance to receive some type of legal status, however he voted against the broader Senate measure. ""Cantor ignored the advice of every Republican pollster and tried to be wishy-washy on immigration,"" Gutiérrez told CNN in a statement. ""He didn't convince the pro-immigration side he was with them and he didn't convince the anti-immigration side he was with them. And he lost. That is not what happened to Sen. (Lindsey) Graham in South Carolina, Rep. (Renee) Elmers in North Carolina, or a number of others who have made a clear case for immigration reform that is not 'amnesty.'"" Cantor's loss might make other Republicans facing conservative challenges skittish, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University Law School. ""One primary does not determine the fate of immigration reform, however it does make it harder for Republicans to do anything before the August recess,"" Yale-Loehr said. But it's not all up to the House. Should Obama use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform? President Barack Obama has also been under pressure from immigration activists and members of his own party to use executive action to push through reform — especially if the House fails to act before the recess. He rejected any notion that Cantor's defeat means the end for immigration reform in the House -- a message he said he would relay to Speaker John Boehner. ""At a certain point, issues are important enough to fight for. My argument about yesterday's election is not that there was too little politics -- there was too little conviction about what was right,"" Obama said at a fundraiser in Boston, according to a press pool account. ""We need to get immigration reform done."" The flood of hundreds of unaccompanied children crossing into this country daily and overflowing holding centers is an issue that could further hasten the administration to act, immigration legal experts say. Obama has called the border situation involving children ""an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response"" and has established a group that will work across federal agencies to help address the problem. In the meantime, supporters also want the President to do more to slow the record number of deportations during his presidency. There have been roughly 2 million deportations under Obama, a number that far eclipses previous presidencies and led the head of the National Council of La Raza to dub him ""the deporter-in-chief."" He has directed the administration to reexamine its deportation policy. Immigration reform advocates also want the administration to make noncriminals and minor offenders the lowest deportation priorities and extend amnesty to the parents and guardians of Dreamers. ""Just because Cantor lost doesn't mean that all of those other conversations and criticisms about not doing something about immigration goes away,"" said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. ""The likelihood was that the President was planning to use executive action anyway regardless of what happened to Cantor.""","Eric Cantor's stunning primary loss Tuesday was a blow to immigration reform .

"(CNN) -- Through a bit of calendrical coincidence, Easter Sunday this year falls on April 20. That's unfortunate because April 20 has become, through no fault of its own, the highest and holiest day of the pot smoker's year. From its origins as the meeting time (4:20 p.m.) of some Bay Area joint-passers in the early 70s, the 4/20 movement has evolved into an annual occasion for mass smoke-outs in leaf-friendly cities like Denver, San Francisco and my hometown of Seattle. So Sunday should be replete with news coverage of sunrise services, Pope Francis on the balcony and twentysomething bros sucking on burrito-size doobies. I expect to see at least one weedhead in bunny ears on the top-o-the-hour news: ""Meanwhile, in Colorado..."" America, I am here to tell you: Don't take the extreme to represent the mainstream. What you see on Sunday may be rude, crude and obnoxious. But it bears as much relevance to marijuana reform as New York's raucous St. Patrick's Day parade does to the history of the Irish people. I say this as a middle-aged pot agnostic who's living with the reality of legalized marijuana. Eighteen months ago I became something of a canary in the cannabis coal mine. My home state of Washington voted to legalize marijuana. I was a father of two kids about to enter their teens. I hadn't touched pot since college. Initially against legalization, I switched my vote at the last minute. Since then I've been digging into the reasons behind that last-minute change of heart -- and, by extension, into the reasons so many Americans have recently changed their minds about marijuana. Believe me, we didn't do it in order to party down with Dreadhead Jones. We did it because our marijuana laws no longer made any sense. As I write this, I'm flying from New Orleans to Denver. In doing so I'm exiting the state with the nation's most Kafkaesque marijuana laws and entering the state with the most regulated legal pot system in the world. Cannabis lovers take Denver's 420 weekend to new highs . Do you know the main difference between the two? It's the number of people in prison for pot. In Louisiana, it's not uncommon to serve five to ten years in prison for minor marijuana possession. Five to ten. That's more than some rape, robbery, or aggravated manslaughter convictions. And it's the main reason Louisiana has the highest per-capita prison population in the world. Last week I spoke with a man who was caught with 2.8 grams of marijuana in his pocket during a classic stop-and-frisk. (Do I need to tell you he's black?) He's the same age as me. He had a wife, a kid, a job. Now he's serving 13 years. ""I don't understand it,"" he told me. ""There are guys in my cell here for violent crimes, awful things, and they're doing less time than me. If I think about it too much it drives me crazy."" I felt like I was talking with a modern-day Jean Valjean. When I land in Denver, I'll stop by the Medicine Man shop over on Nome Street and buy two grams for $34 and change. No one will be harmed in the process. I'll take the bud and a bottle of wine to dinner at a friend's house. He'll probably take a couple puffs on the pot; I'll take one myself, but probably concentrate on the Merlot. Legal or not, weed's not really my thing. How's it working out for Denver? Since the city's retail pot stores opened on January 1, violent crime is down. Property crimes are down. Cops used to arrest about 10,000 people every year for marijuana possession in Colorado. Now they don't. Legal weed hasn't inspired an army of hooligans to tear up the state. It's just kept 10,000 people with a little bud in their pockets from being branded as criminals. Instead of losing their jobs, they keep them. Instead of draining tax dollars as prisoners, they contribute tax dollars as workers and consumers. There is hope for those in Louisiana. An odd-bedfellows coalition of social justice campaigners and fiscal responsibility advocates have joined together to push for sentencing reform. That's a long way from legalization, but it may bring some common sense to an area that's suffered from a dearth of it over the past couple of decades. Kevin Kane, president of the conservative Pelican Institute for Public Policy, is no pot legalizer. He simply believes the sentence should fit the crime. Ten years for a gram of marijuana? ""It offends many people's sense of justice, including mine,"" he told me. By the time I left New Orleans, it looked like reform might have a chance. The Times-Picayune editorial board declared that ""Pot possession penalties are too high,"" and called for saner penalties -- a $100 fine and up to six months in jail. There was talk of considering more drug court deferrals and fewer Les Miserables sentences. This is the day-to-day substance of marijuana reform in America. Some states are moving slowly toward legalization. Others, like Louisiana, aren't down with that, but they are ready to reel in the worst excesses of the drug war. That's something to keep in mind when the most outlandish pot smokers splash across your screens on Sunday. The 4/20 shenanigans are an outlier. Most beer drinkers don't imbibe like Germans at Octoberfest or spring breakers in Florida. And I'm finding it's the same way with pot. The 4/20 exuberants are one-day extremists. The reality of legal pot is something more akin to my dinner in Denver: Quiet, normal, and yes, almost boring.

"Beijing (CNN) -- China reiterated its opposition Wednesday to the publication of air pollution readings in Chinese cities by foreign embassies and dismissed suggestions that it release similar figures for U.S. cities. ""Foreign embassies and consulates in China don't have the legal authority to monitor China's environment or release relevant data, nor do they have the professional capabilities or conditions to do so,"" said Liu Weimin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, at a daily press briefing. ""We hope relevant foreign embassies and consulates will comply with universally recognized international conventions as well as Chinese laws and stop such irresponsible actions."" U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that the U.S. Embassy and consulates in China provide air pollution information to the American community so that ""it can use to make better daily decisions regarding the safety of outdoor activities."" Toner insisted that U.S. diplomatic missions in China would continue releasing the readings, denying Chinese allegations that the U.S. action has violated the Vienna Conventions, a set of international treaties that govern diplomatic relations. He added that Washington would have no objection if the Chinese Embassy decides to publish air pollution index for American cities. But Liu brushed that notion aside. ""We are not interested,"" he said. Vice Minister of Environmental Protection Wu Xiaoqing said Tuesday that, by monitoring China's air pollution and releasing relevant data, foreign embassies have violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, as well as environmental protection laws and regulations of China. Although Wu did not mention specific embassies, the statements have been generally interpreted to be directed at the American diplomatic missions, which maintain popular Twitter feeds providing hourly readings for the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The U.S. Embassy website refers to them as an ""unofficial resource for the health of the Consulate community."" The U.S. readings are widely viewed as a reliable alternative to the official index maintained by China's Environmental Protection Bureau. Derived from a monitoring station in each of the embassy grounds, they typically paint a starker portrait of air quality than official reports, often falling within ""unhealthy"" bands, as defined by a rating system developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. For example, at 11 a.m. Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy reading for Beijing reported a PM 2.5 concentration of 191 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) for an Air Quality Index value of 241, a ""very unhealthy"" score. In contrast, the environmental bureau reported 134 µg/m³ for a ""slightly polluted"" AQI of 142. The EPA system measures air pollution by a PM 2.5 standard, which means particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (less than 1/7 the average width of a human hair). According to the EPA, the ""fine"" particulate matter is believed to pose the greatest health risk because it can lodge deeply in human lungs. China has traditionally monitored pollution at a less-rigorous PM 10 standard , which refers to larger particulates of 10 micrometers or less in diameter, which accumulate in the respiratory system when inhaled. Wu said that it is ""obviously inappropriate"" to be applying foreign standards to the local landscape and that readings determined from a single monitoring station are unscientific. But under pressure to improve its notoriously poor air quality, China began releasing PM 2.5 data for Beijing in January. According to China Daily, Wu said that 74 major cities had been told to raise their monitoring standards to PM 2.5 by the end of October and release data by the end of the year. These rent moves build upon revised air quality policies that require an index of PM 2.5 be implemented nationwide by January 1, 2016.","NEW: Foreign Ministry says embassies lack legal authority to monitor environment .

"(CNN) -- Want to try for a cease-fire to end the burgeoning conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza? Mix a cocktail of three ingredients: urgency, the desire of both sides to climb down; an agreement that allows them to do so; and a mediator to bring it all together. Egypt's latest cease-fire proposal, clearly coordinated with (and accepted by Israel), can't get us there -- at least not yet. Hamas, weak and desperate for a victory, isn't ready to stand down. And even if it were ready to do so, any agreement that's merely a cease-fire won't provide a real solution to the Israel-Hamas problem. Indeed, without a more comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian problem, a cease-fire, even if accompanied by more economic openings for Gaza, will at best offer a temporary respite for these two adversaries. Sooner or later, Israel and Hamas will once again find themselves back in bitter confrontation. We've seen two prequels to this tragic movie. In 2008-9, a conflict over Hamas' high-trajectory weapons ended in an Israeli ground incursion and a unilaterally declared Israeli cease-fire. Then again in November 2012, a weeklong conflict ended in an Egypt-brokered accord that lasted until the latest outbreak. There's no real end state to this confrontation, in large part because of the diametrically opposed objectives of Israel and Hamas, a resistance organization whose very being depends on continued confrontation. Yet Hamas isn't al Qaeda or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Over the years, despite their enmity, Israel and Hamas have at times actually managed to find a way to accommodate one another. In a perverse way, Hamas and Israel serve one another's needs. Hamas needs an enemy to maintain its legitimacy and popular appeal. And Israel may even see advantages in a weakened Hamas that can rule Gaza and control the behavior of smaller jihadi groups. At the same time, for those Israelis opposed to a two-state solution, Hamas' radicalism and rockets represent an ideal argument as to why Israel can't make concessions to achieve one. And that's why it isn't at all surprising that this round, like previous ones, will sooner or later have to end. Israel doesn't want to launch a ground incursion, let alone reoccupy Gaza; and Israeli strikes are hurting Hamas -- and Gazans too -- while Hamas rockets are unable to inflict serious damage on Israel. But de-escalation isn't a do-it-yourself project. It requires mediation, and for the past week nobody has appeared ready to take on the job. The U.N. is viewed as too biased by Israel. The United States rightly didn't want to jump in until both sides seemed more ready to deal. And with no ties with Hamas, Washington isn't especially well-placed to mediate. Turkey has influence with Hamas, but its ties with Israel are too rocky. The Saudis really don't want to get into the middle of this. The Palestinian Authority's Mahmoud Abbas has little influence with either Israel or Hamas. The Qataris do have close ties with Hamas and might play a role, particularly as bankers to pay thousands of Hamas employees, a key Hamas demand. So enter Egypt, the party that brokered the last Israel-Hamas cease-fire in November 2012 . But as Hamas rejection of the Egyptian offer makes clear, it's going to be harder this time around. In 2012, you had a Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt, led by Mohamed Morsy, that maintained very close relations with Hamas. After all, the Muslim Brotherhood spawned the Palestinian organization. This time around, you have a government led by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, whose agenda is quite different. El-Sisi is no Brotherhood lover, to say the least. His rise to power occurred against the backdrop of what he perceived to be an existential threat from the Islamists. And he has made good on his promises of countering Islamists at home and in Gaza. El-Sisi's government has been at the forefront of shutting down Gaza smuggling tunnels and keeps the Rafah border crossing closed (except for a brief opening this past week to let through some wounded Gazans for medical treatment). This environment of extreme distrust between Hamas and the Egyptian government complicates matters. But el-Sisi may have other reasons to engage. He must be sensitive to the civilian casualties in Gaza, which can create political trouble on the Egyptian street, empower Egyptian Islamists, and force him to blast Israel, which he doesn't want to do. And by prewiring the cease-fire with Israel, he keeps the Qataris and Turks who might take Hamas' part in all of this at bay -- for now. Can the Egyptians pull it off? This brings us to the deal itself. Hamas entered the conflict badly weakened by a terrible economic situation in Gaza. It needs some relief and some kind of victory trophy to justify the destruction in Gaza. It has at least three demands: release prisoners picked up in the recent Israeli West Bank sweep; open up Rafah and eliminate other restrictions on moving people and goods; and pay salaries for thousands of Hamas employees. (Qatar has offered to provide money for the salaries, using an intermediary, but Israel has thus far blocked these efforts.) Israel, on the other hand, wants to make sure Hamas doesn't gain too much politically. Squaring this circle won't be easy. Getting rid of Hamas' rockets -- like Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons -- through some kind of international mechanism is likely a bridge too far. And a broader agreement that really guarantees long-term stability, with a real economic opening in Gaza and a formal truce between Israel and Hamas, just doesn't seem possible now. This is the Middle East, not Switzerland. And right now, Cairo will be lucky to work out a more modest deal. Hamas will lose the political battle too if Israel accepts Egypt's offer and it doesn't. Right now, however, its military wing is resisting. Clearly, there's more negotiating in the cards. An agreement that eventually delivers a return to the status quo -- quiet for quiet -- is hardly ideal, but it is more real in the world which Israel and Hamas inhabit than a more ambitious peace deal between the two. How long the clash will last is anyone's guess, but a deal is preferable to the events of last week. The longer the fight goes on, the greater the chances of some truly horrific incident involving massive civilian casualties. That would make escalation, not a deal, inevitable. And nobody -- least of all the people of Gaza -- can afford that.","Aaron Miller and Josh Nason: Three elements are needed for a cease-fire .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Former Egyptian military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is poised to win his country's presidential election in a landslide -- though the legitimacy of his victory is already being questioned. Exit polls suggest el-Sisi won 95.3% of the vote, while opponent Hamdeen Sabahy garnered only 4.7%, according to data from the Egyptian Center for Public Opinion Research and the Egyptian TV channel MBC Masr. Egypt's state-run Ahram Online news agency reported an even more lopsided margin, based on unofficial results, with Sabahy only getting 3.5% of the vote. The final results will be announced by Saturday or Sunday, according to the same agency. Sabahy, el-Sisi's lone competitor, conceded defeat in a press conference Thursday, acknowledging, ""It is time to respect the people's choice and admit my loss."" He didn't embrace the process -- including allegations his campaign representatives were attacked and detained, that el-Sisi's representatives were allowed inside polling stations and claims of forgery -- according to Ahram. ""We cannot give any credibility or ratification to the announced numbers of turnout or results,"" Sabahy said. ""The announced results are an insult to the intelligence of the Egyptians."" Turnout at 48% despite extra day of voting . The election was called amid a turbulent political year in Egypt that saw Mohamed Morsy -- the country's first democratically elected president following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak -- himself removed from power in July in a military coup. El-Sisi, who was army chief at the time, stepped down from his military post this year to run for president. Analysts have said that -- in order to demonstrate his legitimacy -- el-Sisi would want to beat the turnout rate of the 2012 presidential elections, which was 46% in the first round and increased to 51.8%. As it turned out, the country seemingly struggled to get voters to the polls this week. Officials even tacked on a third day of voting Wednesday -- a move both campaigns challenged -- in an attempt to boost turnout. Presidential Elections Commission member Tarek Shebi ended up putting the final turnout figure at 48%, according to Ahram Online -- hardly a resounding number. El-Sisi's campaign hailed the election on its official Facebook page, saying that all those involved helped ""bedazzle"" the world. ""The nation has put itself, with its great people's will, on the beginning of the right track and has stepped firmly and trustingly ... towards the future they've chosen,"" the campaign post said, according to Ahram. It is a future that -- at least for now -- will not include the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that Morsy belonged to and that has been banned and declared a terrorist organization since his ouster. To this end, interim President Adly Mansour issued a decree Thursday canceling Morsy's pardoning of 52 Islamists -- including nine Brotherhood leaders and 18 jihadists -- tied to a failed 1995 assassination attempt on Mubarak.

"Chardon, Ohio (CNN) -- Frank Hall insists he's just a football coach and a study hall teacher, not a hero. But what else do you call someone who, as students crouched for cover and ran for their lives after bullets rang out in the Chardon High School cafeteria, ran at the shooter? Who kept on chasing him, out the door of the Ohio school, during which witnesses reported another shot being fired? And who, after all that, headed back into the cafeteria to comfort the victims? Those questions are more easily answered than why the bloodshed occurred in the first place. Three students died, two others hospitalized and a third got nicked in the ear after being shot by a fellow student, identified by authorities and witnesses as 17-year-old T.J. Lane. T.J. Lane charged with murder . As bad it was, many have been credited for possibly preventing even more carnage. A sophomore girl recalled how her math teacher donned a bullet-proof vest, then pulled in a victim accompanied by a pair of other staff members to safety. Others credited the training conducted at the school, situated in a community of about 5,100 people some 30 miles east of Cleveland, with helping staff and students do the right thing and avert further calamity. Hall said the hero label best applies to the law enforcement personnel who burst into the school after news got out about the shooting, as well as those first responders who came in after them to treat the victims. Yet, as much as he deflected the praise, Hall has gotten heaps of it this week. Ninth-grader Ryan Doyle told CNN that as he was ducking under a table after the first shots were fired, he saw Hall running toward the gunman. Another witness, fellow freshman Danny Komertz, said he believed Hall probably saved other students' lives by acting so decisively to go after the gunman. ""He's a very brave man,"" said Komertz. And U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan put out a statement hours after the shooting crediting ""the extraordinary courage of a teacher"" -- later determined to be Hall -- ""who chased the shooter out of the school."" Grief counselors: Finding a 'new normal' after a school shooting . Except for brief earlier statements, Hall broke his public silence at length Thursday during a news conference in Chardon. He didn't mention chasing the alleged gunman, beyond saying that he and others did what they'd been instructed to do in the case of a mass shooting, ""and it worked."" But he did talk about being with the three teenage boys who eventually succumbed to their injuries -- Daniel Parmertor, 16, who died Monday; Demetrius Hewlin, 16, who died Tuesday morning; and Russell King Jr., 17, who was declared brain dead Tuesday. ""I want you to know I was with them, I prayed with them, I wiped their tears, and I know God was with them,"" Hall said, addressing the boys' families. He extolled and thanked not only law enforcement, but the teachers and support staff at Chardon High ""who went above and beyond, and put the kids before themselves. You're the best America has to offer."" Their ranks would include Joseph Ricci, a math teacher at the school. Kaylee O'Donnell, a 10th-grader, recalled how Ricci shut the door to his classroom, told students to crouch down at the front of the room, then went into a locker and pulled out a bullet-proof vest. Then, she said, Ricci put on the vest and left the room. Soon thereafter, he brought one of the shooting victims inside the room, talking to him and trying to reassure him until more help came. ""Teachers say ... their job is, if somebody comes in and shoots, they will put their life on the line,"" said O'Donnell, describing Ricci as someone who is ""honest, he's trustworthy (and) you can go to him for anything."" ""You never know it until it actually happens. He showed us, instead of told us. That really amazes me, how brave he was."" Neil Thomas, another student, offered a similar sentiment when reflecting on what Hall had done. Until Monday, Hall was probably best known as a coach -- mentoring quarterbacks and defensive backs for the Hilltoppers, according to a football camp brochure from the program, with board of education notes indicating he has also served as an assistant track coach. Yet Thomas said that Hall's heart and words resonated with students, making it clear in the past that he'd do anything for them. It just happens that on Monday, in the worst possible circumstances, he was able to prove it. ""Coach Hall, he always talks about how much he cares about us students, his team and everyone,"" said Thomas. ""And I think today he really went out and he proved how much he cared about us. He would take a bullet for us."" In his comments Thursday, Hall again expressed his love for Chardon High's youngsters -- urging them to show that ""terror and evil do not win out"" as they headed back to class with him the next day. ""I can't tell you how great these children are,"" he said. CNN's Martin Savidge contributed to this report.","Frank Hall chased an Ohio school gunman from the school, witnesses say .

"(CNN) -- The flood of unaccompanied children crossing illegally into Texas has prompted the federal government to action, after holding centers for them overflowed. The General Services Administration plans to convert a warehouse in McAllen, Texas, into a processing center for the minors, according to a city building permit. The U.S. Border Patrol will run the 55,702-square-foot building about 3 miles from the Mexican border that will temporarily hold up to 1,000 children. It would seem like a drop in the bucket. About 400 children cross into Texas per day, said Rep. Henry Cuellar. The Texas Democrat represents the district where most of them enter. Many are seeking more opportunity or want to reunite with family. But violence in their home countries -- particularly Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala -- is is helping create an acute tide of child migrants. U.S. authorities estimate 60,000 to 80,000 children from Central America will arrive this year in the United States without a parent or guardian. Some of them are infants. ""This is a humanitarian crisis,"" said Cuellar. The government has no idea yet how it will feed, house and diaper the children. Partisan fights . Political friction erupted over the inrush of unaccompanied minors after images appeared this spring showing some of them packed into detention centers in Arizona. Republicans accused the Obama administration of not enforcing immigration laws. Texas has been so overwhelmed that federal officials are transporting busloads of immigrants, including minors, to Arizona. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer slammed the move. ""Not only does the federal government have no plan to stop this disgraceful policy, it also has no plan to deal with the endless waves of illegal aliens once they are released here,"" she said in a statement. Pods, holding cells . A floor plan of the McAllen facility shows the building divided into four pods, with each pod containing five holding cells for 252 detainees. Another floor plan shows a new chain-link fence around the property, temporary shower and laundry units, a play area, food service areas and an isolation area. Each pod will contain an activity space with a raised agent observation station. The children will use portable toilets with hand-washing stations, and detainees will be separated by gender and further separated by age. If it comes to fruition, the McAllen facility won't be the only one to house detained children. Naval Base Ventura County, which is outside Los Angeles, recently opened its doors to hundreds of children mainly from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Children also are being housed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. The General Services Administration has a 12-month lease. The building plans don't have a projected completion date. Another new facility that will house 1,200 minors is in the works for Fort Sill. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin has criticized the administration for over its decision to open it.","The GSA is converting a warehouse in McAllen, Texas, into a processing center .

"(CNN) -- Brian Sanderholm thinks Justin Thurber deserves to die for raping and killing his 19-year-old daughter. A Kansas jury sentenced Jodi Sanderholm's killer, Justin Thurber, to death in February. ""I believe in an eye for an eye. If you do the crime, you need to have justice,"" he said. ""In the end, it's up to the jury, but all that matters is that he can't hurt anyone again."" But amid a time of economic turmoil some legislators in Kansas and elsewhere say the price of justice is too high. They have introduced legislation to take the death penalty off the books over financial concerns. Jodi Sanderholm was last seen alive on January 5, 2007, at dance practice at Cowley College in Arkansas City, Kansas, where she was a student and member of the Cowley College Tigerettes Danceline. Her bruised and battered body was found four days later in a pile of brush, bearing signs of a violent and prolonged death that prosecutors likened to torture. A jury sentenced Thurber to death on February 18. A Kansas court will decide whether to uphold the jury's verdict in a hearing scheduled for March 20. If Kansas Senate Bill 208 passes as written, it won't take effect until July 1, so it is unlikely to affect Thurber's sentence. But future savings could be substantial. ""Because of the downturn in the national economy, we are facing one of the largest budget deficits in our history,"" state Sen. Carolyn McGinn, a Republican, said in an opinion piece posted on TheKansan.com Friday. ""What is certain is we are all going to have to look at new and creative ways to fund state and community programs and services."" The state would save more than $500,000 per case by not seeking the death penalty, McGinn wrote, money that could be used for ""prevention programs, community corrections and other programs to decrease future crimes against society."" Fiscal concerns are just a part of McGinn's argument. She has also cited the disproportionate rate of minorities that are sentenced to death. Kansas reintroduced the death penalty in 1994 but has not executed a condemned inmate since 1965. Anti-death-penalty groups say longer jury selection, extra expert witnesses, jury consultants and an extended penalty phase tend to make death penalty trials more costly than non-death-penalty cases. Extra safeguards in place to ensure a fair verdict, including additional investigators and defense attorneys certified to handle death cases, who spend more time researching and litigating the case, also drive up costs.  See a chart comparing the costs of two murder trials » . A 2008 study by the Urban Institute, an economic and social policy research group based in Maryland, found that an average capital murder trial in the state resulting in a death sentence costs about $3 million, or $1.9 million more than a case where the death penalty is not sought. A similar 2008 study by the ACLU in Northern California found that a death- penalty trial costs about $1.1 million more than a non-death-penalty trial in California. McGinn's bill faces opposition from various sides, including victims' rights groups and the state's top prosecutor, who says there are no hard numbers related to the cost of the death penalty. New Mexico, which also has a bill before the Legislature to abolish the death penalty, has already seen a case where costs dictated the outcome.  See which states have bills to get rid of the death penalty » . Last year, the New Mexico attorney general's office agreed to drop the death penalty for two inmates involved in the stabbing death of a guard, Ralph Garcia, during a 1999 riot at the Guadalupe County Correctional Facility. The change came after the state Legislature failed to provide additional funding for defense attorneys contracted to handle the case by the public defender's office. In court documents filed at the time, Attorney General Gary King said his office could not ""in good faith under these circumstances"" pursue the death penalty against Robert Young and Reis Lopez. Even Garcia's wife lent her voice to the case, writing a letter to then-Assistant Attorney General Michael Fox explaining why she did not support the death penalty. ""I would rather see the death penalty be abolished and reparation be made to the victims, wives or husbands and to their children. I know how hard it is to go look for a job when my job was staying home and taking care of the home and kids and my husband was the breadwinner,"" Rachel Garcia wrote in a letter dated February 28, 2005. ""My husband would [have] wanted something like this as much as I do because he so much loved his family."" Her sentiments became part a bill to abolish the death penalty that was introduced in 2007 and died on the Senate floor in New Mexico. Its supporters are hopeful it has a better chance this year -- so far, it has passed the House of Representatives and is awaiting action in the Senate. ""I think it helps the debate from being less emotional than it has the potential to be,"" Democratic Rep. Gail Chasey said. ""People will say we can't put a price on justice, but in fact, we do put a price on justice when we are not able to give our district attorneys, our police departments, our attorney general the funding they need."" In Colorado, House Bill 1274 proposes to put the anticipated savings from abolishing the death penalty toward the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's cold case homicide team. Guy Morton's family thought he was missing for 12 years until they learned his remains had been misidentified. The state has about 1,430 unsolved homicides dating back to 1970, according to Howard Morton, founder of the Families of Homicide Victims and Missing Persons, an advocacy group pushing for the bill. For Morton, whose son, Guy, disappeared in 1975, the issue goes beyond the misuse of tax dollars. Guy was considered a missing person for 12 years until forensic examination revealed that his remains had been misidentified. His killer was never found. ""As bad as it is to think that our son's killer is still on the streets or in our neighborhoods, there's nothing worse than feeling like he's been forgotten, just another file in a basement,"" he said. ""Once you've had a loved one murdered, there can be no closure, but there can be resolution, the feeling like, oh well, at least justice was done."" Kansas, New Mexico and Colorado, among the states where legislators are seeking to get rid of the death penalty, have carried out few or no executions since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976. On the other hand, Texas, Georgia and Virginia, which consistently lead the nation in executions each year, show no signs of changing course. Earlier this month, Virginia legislators voted to expand capital punishment to include those who assist in a murder, and those who kill an auxiliary police officer or on-duty fire marshal. A bill to abolish the death penalty is also before the Texas legislature, but Harris County District Attorney Pat Lykos intends to proceed with 194 pending death penalty cases she has on the books. ""We will spare no expense. We will go after them. Justice has no price tag,"" Lykos said. ""We want to be as cost-effective as possible without compromising the administration of justice and public safety."" Nonetheless, budget concerns in those states still hamper some efforts to seek the death penalty. In Georgia, where Gov. Sonny Perdue has ordered all government agencies to trim their budgets by 6 percent, Jamie Ryan Weis, on trial for murder, has been sitting in a jail without a lawyer for more than a year. The Georgia Public Defender Standards Council appointed two private attorneys in 2006 to represent Weis, who is charged with the murder of Catherine King. They were pulled from the case a year later because of a lack of funds, court documents indicate, and the Georgia Public Defender Standards Council has yet to replace them. ""The state basically says we want to have the death penalty and we don't want to pay for it. It's like the state says it's going to the grocery store to buy the most expensive food and it's not going to pay for it,"" said attorney Don Samuel, one of three attorneys attempting to obtain a lawyer for Weis. Griffin Judicial Circuit District Attorney Scott Ballard said he plans to seek the death penalty against Weis, no matter how long it takes or how much it costs. ""I think that if you start deciding it's too expensive to pursue the death penalty, then you're encouraging the defense to make it too expensive, and our duty to the public is too great to succumb to that,"" Ballard said. Back in Kansas, Brian Sanderholm says the state has a duty to victims, too. He opposes efforts to abolish the death penalty because he says families should be able to weigh in on an appropriate punishment, and juries should render the final outcome. In fact, if Thurber had admitted sooner to having killed his daughter, the father says he would have accepted a life sentence for him. But by the time Thurber decided to admit his role and seek a plea deal with prosecutors, his family had already been through too much, Sanderholm says. ""It was too late,"" Sanderholm said. ""We'd struggled so much, but after struggling for two years, we decided we're just going to go on with it.""

"(CNN) -- Once a fixture on the red carpet and a staple of the daily news cycle, Paris Hilton has recently all but disappeared from the American consciousness. Has the socialite who became famous simply for being famous ceded her throne to a new set of up-and-coming reality stars and party fixtures, or has she gone purposely dark in order to resurrect her brand like a phoenix rising from the ashes? ""She built the ultimate how-to guide on building a celebrity brand. Now she is in the second phase of the program, the disappearing act,"" said Samantha Yanks, editor-in-chief of Gotham and Hamptons magazines, two publications which often featured content about Hilton. ""Phase one was the ascension, seemingly out of nowhere,"" Yanks said. ""That came with a media frenzy, the antics, the partying, the music, the babe-like status and of course, the fashion label. Phase two, she disappears."" Paris Hilton broke onto the New York City socialite scene in 2001, more famous for her late-night partying than for the small modeling jobs she had started taking. But her fame factor really began to take off when she starred in the Fox reality television series ""The Simple Life,"" with her childhood best friend Nicole Richie, in 2003. Hilton leveraged her fame from ""The Simple Life"" by pushing the Paris Hilton brand into books, perfumes, shoes and nightclubs. She landed a minor role in the film ""House of Wax"" and a leading role in the straight-to-DVD movies, ""National Lampoons' Pledge This"" and ""Bottoms Up."" Despite bad movie reviews, Hilton managed to make news whether it was for a leaked sex tape, a bad breakup with a slew of less famous boyfriends or for appearing in public without underwear. She was so pervasive that in 2004 New York Daily News gossip columnist Lloyd Grove banned her from his page and in 2007 The Associated Press conducted an experiment to try not reporting on Hilton for a week. Grove was successful for two years. The AP made it through its weeklong blackout and then reported on Hilton's arrest for driving with a suspended license nine days after the blackout began. Now, two years later, most news outlets would be hard pressed to find a recent story about Hilton that they had to report. The gossip and tabloid news cycle typically responds to what the public wants. The absence of Hilton in public life could merely be a response to a new generation of tabloid consumers' lack of interest in her. ""Paris just doesn't nearly have the mass appeal she had a few years ago. She shows up at events, but people are much more concerned with whether Robert Pattinson's going to show up with his secret girlfriend Kristen Stewart,"" explained Star magazine's Suzanne Rozdeba, a senior editor. ""She's not working on a scandalous reality show, or groundbreaking project, or starring in a horror movie, or dating hunky Taylor Lautner, so people are honestly just tired of hearing about her partying. Maybe people are just simply tired of her."" It is hard to believe that after years of honing her ability to exploit herself and her name, Hilton has simply let the media forget about her. Perhaps dipping below the radar is exactly what Hilton is looking to do in order to rebuild her brand. ""Paris invented it all -- the whole famous-for-being-famous act,"" said Jared Shapiro, executive editor of Life & Style magazine. ""And since then others have taken the torch. But it's not like she's done. She knows she hit oversaturation and she's taking a breather, working on a second album and developing some TV. I still firmly believe she's one of the more famous people in 'Celebrity-ville.' The second she's pregnant, has a baby, or gets married, major interest will peak.""               Hilton, who has never been known to do anything discretely, did just that last week by quietly launching her line of hair styling products. The line includes the ""Celebrity Styler"" and the ""Ultimate Styling Brush,"" in Hilton's signature pink. The launch at the Thompson Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, lacked the typical Hilton entourage of paparazzi, media scrum and celebrity friends. The guest list was kept to Hilton's friends and family, including her sister Nicky Hilton and her boyfriend Doug Reinhardt. But in addition to her hair products, Hilton has also been in the studio recording her second album. ""It's smart for Paris to keep a low profile until she is ready to come back with a more defined and sophisticated brand,"" said branding expert Rebecca Brooks, president of The Brooks Group. ""Americans have proven to be extremely forgiving when it comes to stars and their shenanigans and I think they will be receptive.""","Industry insiders and gossip watchers have noticed a sudden drop in Paris Hilton sightings .
Some experts believe that Hilton is quietly plotting a comeback through an upcoming record release .

"(CNN) -- At least 118 people were killed Tuesday in twin blasts at a market in the central Nigerian city of Jos, an official said, warning the toll could climb. The explosions, which targeted Terminus market, went off some 20 to 30 minutes apart, setting fire to the entire venue. ""The death toll stands at 118. This is the number of victims recovered from the scene of the explosions, but we are still searching through the smoldering debris for more bodies,"" said Mohammed Abdulsalam, coordinator for the National Emergency Management Agency in the city. ""The figure may rise when the search is over,"" Abdulsalam said. A journalist on the scene of the first explosion called it ""massive."" People were screaming and running, some covered in blood. Some had to be carried away, the journalist said. An ambulance driver who asked not to be identified said he saw at least 15 bodies and about 30 injured. Plateau State Commissioner Chris Olakpe described the blasts as ""terrorist activities,"" but refused to speculate on who might be responsible. He said the first blast was a suicide car bomb, while the second was caused by an improvised explosive device in a separate car. Olakpe said 46 people were killed in the blasts and that 45 were injured, disputing the higher death toll provided by Abdulsalam. It is not uncommon for authorities to report conflicting death tolls in the immediate aftermath of attacks. ""Terrorists usually want to cause fear and trepidation,"" said Olakpe. ""By tomorrow, we will get on top of the matter."" In a statement, President Goodluck Jonathan condemned the bombings as a ""tragic assault on human freedom"" and described those behind them as ""cruel and evil."" ""President Jonathan assures all Nigerians that government remains fully committed to winning the war against terror, and this administration will not be cowed by the atrocities of enemies of human progress and civilization,"" the statement said, adding that Nigeria was committed to implementing anti-terrorism measures and resolutions put forth at a recent summit in Paris. When CNN tried to speak with a nurse at a local hospital by phone, she was unable to hear because of victims' cries and screams. CNN had previously reported three blasts at two markets -- Terminus and Abuja. Terminus market is also known as the New Abuja market. A possible third blast may have been a gas canister ignited by the first bomb. Late Sunday, a bomb in the northern Nigerian city of Kano killed at least four people, according to local police. The blast occurred at a busy intersection in a predominantly Christian area of the city and left several cars burning, Kano police spokesman Rabilu Ringim said. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack, the spokesman said. Terrorism in Nigeria has been in the spotlight recently since more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped by the militant group Boko Haram. The terror group abducted 276 girls on April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls are still missing. In his statement Tuesday, Jonathan reaffirmed his government's commitment to take ""every necessary measure"" to find the girls and cooperate with other countries in the region to combat the ""Boko Haram menace."" The president also said Nigeria was determined to ensure safety and security in schools in Borno state and other parts of the country and to rebuild the school in Chibok. The government will collaborate with U.N. education envoy, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, to launch a safety program called the ""Safe Schools Initiative,"" said presidential spokesman Reuben Abati.

"New York (CNN) -- Just five days into his arbitration hearing, Alex Rodriguez filed suit Friday in New York Supreme Court against Major League Baseball and its commissioner, Bud Selig. He alleges that MLB and Selig ""engaged in tortious and egregious conduct with one and only one goal ... to destroy the reputation and career of Alex Rodriguez."" The lawsuit claims that in its investigation of Anthony Bosch and his Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in Miami, Major League Baseball engaged in vigilante justice to prove that Rodriguez was using performance enhancing drugs. Attorney: Rodriguez had 'consulting relationship' with Biogenesis . ""They have ignored the procedures set forth in baseball's collectively bargained labor agreements; violated the strict confidentiality imposed by these agreements; paid individuals millions of dollars and made promises of future employment to individuals in order to get them to produce documents and to testify on MLB' s behalf; bullied and intimidated those individuals who refused to cooperate with their witch hunt; and singled out (Rodriguez) for an unprecedented 211-game suspension -- the longest non-permanent ban in baseball history,"" the suit says. Rodriguez, 38, is fighting to overturn the suspension and has hired a high-priced team of lawyers, publicists and investigators. He has shown up each day during this week's arbitration process at MLB's Park Avenue headquarters. His lawsuit outside the arbitration process is an effort to save his reputation and his $25 million salary for the 2014 season. Rodriguez says the investigation, which was supposed to stay private, has permanently harmed his reputation and ensured that he will never again secure any endorsement contracts. The 31-page document includes a litany of allegations, including that MLB went around collective bargain agreements to make an example of Rodriguez and to ""gloss over Selig's past inaction and tacit approval of the use of performance enhancing substances in baseball and to secure his legacy as the savior of America's pastime."" Rodriguez fights suspension . There are accusations that a representative of MLB purchased stolen documents for $150,000 in cash, documents presumably that would document Rodriguez's use of performance enhancing drugs. In addition, the document says the same MLB representative engaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with a witness in the case against Rodriguez. The suit suggests that in exchange for Bosch's assistance, MLB promised to provide him security, pay his legal bills, and indemnify him for civil liability that may arise from his cooperation. It accuses Selig of conducting a witch hunt, and attacks his tenure as commissioner, mentioning the strike in 1994-1995. It also gives says steroids were used by other players, including Mark McGuire, Sammy Sosa and Jose Canseco. The suit says that in its investigation of Rodriguez in the Biogenesis case that is currently before an arbitration panel at MLB headquarters in New York, baseball officials paid millions of dollars to individuals and bullied and intimidated them to produce documents that incriminated Rodriguez and to testify on MLB's behalf. The document alleges that the lawsuit filed by MLB against Biogenesis is a sham aimed at obtaining information about MLB players. Rodriguez: 'I'm fighting for my life' Rodriguez is seeking compensatory and punitive damages from MLB, which he accuses of leaking stories to the media during the Biogenesis investigation. He also says an appearance by Selig on David Letterman's show turned what was supposed to be a confidential disciplinary and appeal process into a public trial. ""Taking down Mr. Rodriguez,"" the suit contends, ""would vividly demonstrate that Commissioner Selig had learned from the errors of his previous explicit or tacit tolerance of steroid use."" MLB's actions were ""done solely with the intent of harming Mr. Rodriguez and interfering with his business relationships,"" the suit says. In response, Major League Baseball issued a statement Friday calling the lawsuit ""a clear violation of the confidentiality provisions of our drug program"" and an attempt to circumvent the collective bargaining agreement that laid out how MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association handle the grievance process. ""While we vehemently deny the allegations in the complaint, none of those allegations is relevant to the real issue: whether Mr. Rodriguez violated the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program by using and possessing numerous forms of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including testosterone and human growth hormone, over the course of multiple years and whether he violated the Basic Agreement by attempting to cover up his violations of the program by engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct and frustrate the Office of the Commissioner's investigation."" In a statement to CNN, Rodriguez said, ""The entire legal dynamic is very complex, and my legal team is doing what they need to in order to vindicate me and pursue all of my rights. This matter is entirely separate from the ongoing arbitration. I look forward to the arbitration proceedings continuing, and for the day to come when I can share my story with the public and my supporters."" Rodriguez's suspension was far longer than the punishment handed down to 13 other players connected to Biogenesis. The others, including stars Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers and Nelson Cruz of the Texas Rangers, accepted their suspensions and didn't fight the league.

"Washington (CNN) -- Engaging a rarely used power, House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa announced his committee will vote next Thursday on whether to hold former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify about the agency's targeting of conservative organizations. ""Documents and testimony point to Lois Lerner as a senior IRS official responsible for conduct that deprived Americans of their rights to free speech and equal protection under the law,"" wrote the California Republican in a statement released Thursday. Lerner ran the IRS division that determined tax-exempt status for nonprofit organizations. An IRS inspector general's report concluded that her division used ""inappropriate"" search terms to flag some conservative applications, including ""Tea Party"" and ""patriot."" Democrats have pointed out that some liberal terms, such as ""progressive,"" were also on the list. The contempt vote caps a year of dramatic back-and-forth in House Republicans' investigation into the targeting. GOP leaders, including Issa, have focused on whether higher-ranking officials, including any at the White House, played a role blocking conservative organizations' applications. Thus far, no evidence has shown that the effort to flag political groups went beyond Lerner and her employees. Issa has said that Lerner's testimony could prove critical. But the former IRS official has repeatedly refused to answer the committee's questions, invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. That normally might protect her from contempt of Congress charges. But Republicans charge that Lerner waived her constitutional right by first reading a statement to the committee asserting her innocence. ""I believe Lois Lerner waived her Fifth Amendment privilege,"" Issa said in a hearing last June. ""She did so when she chose to make a voluntary opening statement."" Republicans argue and cite some case law showing that an individual cannot apply the Fifth Amendment in some instances and not others. But the case law on the Fifth Amendment is nuanced, and Lerner's attorney and House Democrats have fervently disagreed with Republicans' conclusion. They insist she is protected by the Fifth Amendment. The debate could spark a potential legal battle. Overall, Democrats call the investigation a witch hunt and the contempt vote a publicity move. ""This contempt vote appears geared more toward generating more press for (Issa), rather than working responsibly with committee members to seek facts,"" said Jennifer Hoffman, who is the spokesman for the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Elijah Cummings of Maryland. Lerner's attorney's office said it had no comment yet on the upcoming committee vote. The contempt resolution is expected to pass the Republican-led Oversight Committee Thursday morning. The House is in recess the following week, meaning the soonest a contempt vote could hit the House floor is the week of April 24. Even without the Fifth Amendment issue, it's not clear how far the case will go. After a House vote to find Lerner in contempt, the process would leave Republicans' hands and go to the U.S. attorney for Washington, who would be directed to call a grand jury. That is where the last contempt of Congress charge ended. In 2012, the Republican House of Representatives voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to hand over documents related to the ""Fast and Furious"" gun controversy. The White House asserted executive privilege at that time, and the Justice Department announced it would not prosecute. The Obama administration has not claimed executive privilege in Lerner's case, but the Justice Department still retains the ability to determine whether her actions deserve prosecution.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal, the man who stood on top of the tennis world after winning his ninth French Open title last weekend, was brought back to earth with a bump Thursday. The world No.1, so dominant on the clay at Roland Garros, was beaten in the first round of the ATP grass-court event in Halle, Germany, by a player ranked 84 places below him. German Dustin Brown required less than an hour to win 6-4 6-1 on the grass to send Nadal crashing out of the tournament. The Spaniard, playing his first match on grass since he was stunned in the opening game of last year's Wimbledon, appeared to struggle with the transition. At Wimbledon 12 months ago, Nadal was beaten by Czech Lukas Rosol who was ranked 100 at the time in a five-set thriller. And any hopes he would be given the chance to warmup for a return to SW19 were given short shrift by home favorite Brown. Brown had only ever beaten one top-10 player, John Isner, and this result ranks as his best yet. Nadal wasn't the only star to falter Thursday -- Andy Murray, who is set to start the defense of his Wimbledon title later this month, was beaten at Queen's Club in London. Murray was beaten by veteran Czech Radek Stepanek 7-6 6-2 in his second match since appointing former women's No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach. The 27-year-old, who won the Queens title in 2009, 2011 and 2013, had won his past 19 matches on grass. ""I have only got myself to blame that I lost the first set,"" the Scot told the ATP website. ""I don't know how many set points I had, but quite a lot of them were on my serve. ""On this surface especially you shouldn't really be losing sets like that. For me, that's what's disappointing really about the match. Then, unfortunately, got broken in the first game of the second set. I couldn't quite get it back."" The 35-year-old Stepanek's reward is a quarterfinal clash with South African Kevin Anderson. Meanwhile, seven-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer survived a scare in Halle before booking his place in the quarterfinals with a 6-7 6-4 6-2 win over Joao Sousa. The Swiss ace, who has won this tournament on six occasions, will face Taiwan's Yen-Hsun Lu for a place in the semifinals. ""It was slightly frustrating at times clearly, but nevertheless I served well and kept on doing my thing,"" said fourth-ranked Federer, who lost in the last 16 at Roland Garros. ""It was important to stay calm and actually I think it gives me more confidence winning this way. ""I had to stay calm, fight through the match and find a way and then the last set and a half were much better. So, I'm actually pretty happy now.""","Rafael Nadal beaten in opening round of ATP event in Germany .

"(CNN) -- A four-minute video lampooning your image as an international statesman is not the ideal start to a foreign tour. But this week, Australia's increasingly unpopular Prime Minister Tony Abbott will put an unflattering viral video behind him as he embarks on a 10-day trip to Indonesia, France, Canada and the U.S. As the clip, from John Oliver's ""Last Week Tonight,"" spread through social media, the show tweeted: ""Australia is a continent divided! After last night's episode, they are unable to decide between hashtags #TonyDumbDumb and #TonyDumDum."" The most recent opinion polls back up the sentiment. According to Newspoll surveys commissioned by The Australian newspaper, Abbott's approval rating has slipped to 33%, down from his highest ever rating of 45% in November last year. Mending ties with Indonesia . Abbott's foreign tour starts in Indonesia Wednesday when he meets President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on the Indonesian island of Batam. It will be their face-to-face meeting in six months, following a period of frosty relations between the two countries. Relations soured last November amid allegations that Australian intelligence agencies phone-tapped Indonesia's leader, his wife and close allies. Indonesia immediately recalled its ambassador, who has only recently returned to his post. ""The clear indication from Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is that he wants this thing to end on good terms as he completes his presidency of 10 years,"" Ross Tapsell, a lecturer in Asian Studies at the Australian National University told CNN. Yudohoyono will step down after two terms in office, when the country votes for a new leader in July. ""He's clearly been known to be a friend of Australia... and he's prided himself on his international statesman image. Certainly as he comes to the end of his reign that will be how he will be wanting his legacy to be reflected, because domestically he's been rating very poorly in the polls,"" Tapsell said. Abbott has made it clear too he wants to mend ties, on Tuesday brushing aside revelations that Indonesian journalists were in the room listening to an ostensibly private phone conversation between Abbott and Yudhoyono last month. Asked by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Chris Ulhmann whether he knew journalists were listening, Abbott said, ""the important thing is the quality of the conversation."" Describing the call as ""very genial,"" Abbott said ""there is no doubt that President Yudhoyono is and will always be, I think, a great friend of Australia."" A transcript of the phone call was published on an Indonesian website in early May. A partial transcript published by the ABC on Tuesday revealed a seemingly innocuous conversation about when they'd next meet. Voter discontent . Abbott's problems at home center on a deeply unpopular budget the government has been struggling to sell since it was announced two weeks ago. Described as the worst-received federal budget in more than 20 years, it raised taxes, cut benefits, increased university fees and imposed a new fee for medical visits. Abbott maintains the budget is a painful but necessary remedy to years of overspending by the former Labor government. However, critics accuse him of breaking pre-election promises and imposing spending cuts that unfairly target the poor. Tough asylum policy . One of Abbott's main pre-election policies was a tougher stance on asylum seekers who arrive in Australian waters by boat. As well as a continuation of offshore processing, the Liberal leader advocated a ""turn-back"" policy; approval for the Australian Navy to force boats in Australian waters to turn around ""when it is safe to do so."" The policy rankled Indonesia, especially after a Joint Review by Australian authorities found Australian vessels ""inadvertently"" strayed into Indonesian waters six times between December 2013 and January 2014. ""The Indonesia government has I think quite fairly been arguing for some time that there needs to be regional cooperation on the issue of asylum seekers and indeed the stop the boats policy was seen as a unilateral action,"" Tapsell said. During the eight months it has been in power, Abbott's government has succeeded in drastically reducing the number of boats arriving in Australia. The Prime Minister told the ABC the government's policies had removed a ""source of friction"" with Indonesia -- ""Because none of them are making it to Australia, very few of them are leaving Indonesian shores. The whole point of leaving Indonesia is to get to Australia and if you never get to Australia, why bother leaving Indonesia?"" After the phone tapping controversy, Indonesia called for a ""code of conduct"" to be agreed before relations return to normal. However it's unlikely it will be announced this week as the document is still being drafted. Beyond Indonesia . After Indonesia, Abbott is due to attend the official D-Day commemorations in France on June 6, before traveling to Canada for talks with Prime Minister Stephen Harper, then the U.S. where he'll meet President Barack Obama. Trade will dominate talks there as Abbott attempts to attract foreign investment with the mantra that Australia is ""once again open for business."" Abbott has acknowledged his government faces a ""very, very big job"" at home convincing voters that the measures announced in the budget will eventually pay off. The upcoming series of high-profile meetings is Abbott's opportunity to redefine early perceptions of his premiership, and deflect the conversation away from a choice of unflattering hashtags.","Australian, Indonesian leaders to meet for first time in six months Wednesday .

"GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (CNN) -- Guatemalan voters saw the top five top candidates in their country's presidential race square off in a historic debate Thursday evening, a contrast to the violence and name-calling that has marred the campaign in recent months. Alvaro Colom, Eduardo Suger, Rigoberta Menchu,  Alejandro Giammattei and Otto Perez Molina debate. A major topic among the presidential contenders was how to reduce Guatemala's high crime rate and violence. They also addressed concerns about the illegal migration of Guatemalans to the United States, with two candidates calling the migrants ""heroes."" The televised debate, co-sponsored by CNN en Español and Guatemala's Channel 3, came 10 days before the general election in which 5 million Guatemalans are eligible to go to the polls to select a president and vice president, along with 158 congressional deputies. The debate was viewed as a landmark step forward for Guatemala's democracy and was televised throughout the Western Hemisphere. While there are 14 candidates in the presidential race, only five have registered significant support in public opinion polls. If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of all votes cast September 9, a runoff would be held November 4. Alvaro Colom of the center-left National Union of Hope, considered a front-runner, said reducing poverty would help reduce crime. ""Crime is not just about prosecution; it's not just about justice,"" Colom said. ""Crime also has its origins in Guatemala's profound social problems -- poverty, marginalization, discrimination, neglect. Our comprehensive program has a part that is about security, but the counterweight to it is the human solidarity program, so that we really have health, housing, jobs, and we can truly build a better Guatemala."" Retired Gen. Otto Perez Molina of the conservative Patriot Party, also considered a front-runner, said he would strengthen Guatemala's police and military while getting tough with criminals. Molina said the death penalty, which he said was on the books but ""in limbo,"" was needed. Molina warned criminals that they would face a strong president who would protect Guatemalans if he were elected. Prisons Director Alejandro Giammattei, the candidate of outgoing President Oscar Berger's Grand National Alliance party, said he would work to keep high-risk youths from joining gangs. Giammattei also called for gun control laws and measures to battle organized crime and its financing. Rigoberta Menchu of the Encounter for Guatemala party, a 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the national police force should be purged and corrupt politicians prosecuted. Menchu also criticized the system of white-collar privilege in the country's prisons. She said no one in Guatemala has had the courage to fight organized crime. Eduardo Suger of Center for Social Action called for the country's judicial branch to be depoliticized. Suger said the creation of Guatemala's Commission Against Impunity was an acknowledgment that the government was not doing its duty to protect citizens. The political debate has been overshadowed by a wave of violence that has seen more than 40 candidates, activists and political leaders killed since the campaigns officially kicked off May 2. The ""extremely concerning"" level of violence led Amnesty International to release an open letter to candidates this week asking that they ""ensure the electoral campaign is conducted in a manner consistent with respect for the rule of law and human rights standards."" The human rights group also called for an end to ""clandestine groups who operate with absolute impunity"" 11 years after the country's long-running civil war officially came to a close. Colom, whose National Union of Hope has been hit hardest by the killings, told international reporters this month: ""Of 18 assassinations of our people, 14 were without any doubt carried out by organized crime."" All five candidates generally agreed on the issue of illegal migration to the United States, saying their government needed to improve living conditions in Guatemala so there would be less incentive to leave. They also agreed that the Guatemalan government should work closely with Washington to make life better for those who do migrate. Molina estimated that 60 percent of the 1.3 million Guatemalans in the United States were undocumented, but he said they provide Guatemala with its main source of foreign currency. Menchu called it ""an embarrassment"" that Guatemala could not negotiate for better living conditions for citizens who have moved to the United States and ""are building houses and schools"" there. She said she would create a negotiating team to push for the well-being of Guatemalans in the United States. Giammattei called the migrants ""national heroes"" who risk their lives for a better future but labeled the situation a ""badge of shame"" for Guatemala because the country hasn't generated opportunities for its people at home. Colom said the migrants to the United States were ""true heroes who go there to work, not to bother anyone; they go there in search of a dream."" Colom said he would ""build a great nation that will generate hope here in Guatemala and bring hope back to Guatemala."" Suger said that as president he would negotiate a 10-year program with the United States to provide educational programs for Guatemalan migrants so they could finish school, which he said would allow them to return to Guatemala with new skills and money saved.

"(CNN) -- He played the ukelele, weighed in on the Obamacare debacle and even flashed his prehistoric flip cell phone. Suffice it to say, we got to see another side of Warren Buffett during an interview with Piers Morgan Tuesday night. Accompanied by his son and grandson, the billionaire investor gave his unique take on almost everything. And with that, he let Morgan and American take a quick peek in his wallet. Literally. Here are some of the highlights. On Obamacare and Kathleen Sebelius . Buffett has in the past supported President Barack Obama. And it seems that this support extends to embattled U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. Buffett says give Sebelius some time to fix the Obamacare mess she is overseeing. ""I am a friend of Kathleen's. And I'm a friend of her when she's in trouble. I like Kathleen. I feel sorry for her in the position she's in. Obviously, it's a huge screw up but it will get worked out, "" Warren Buffet told Piers Morgan. On technology . Can you tell a lot about the wealth of a man from his cell phone? Apparently not when it comes to the 83-year-old financial guru. ""This is the one Alexander Graham Bell gave me,"" joked Buffett, as he revealed a Nokia flip phone, a relic compared to today's smartphones. ""I don't throw anything away until I've had it 20 or 25 years."" By the way, Buffett's son, Howard Graham Buffett, did not bring a phone to the interview. And grandson Howard Warren Buffett led the three generations when it came to technology. He had two Blackberries. Buffett's standoffish approach to technology extends to e-mail. ""I sent one e-mail in my life,"" revealed Warren Buffett. ""I sent it to Jeff Raikes at Microsoft and it ended up in court in Minneapolis, so I am one for one."" On his biggest mistake . When you are one of the richest people in the world, it is hard to say you made many mistakes. Buffett listed one. ""I bought a company in the mid-90s called Dexter Shoe and paid $400 million for it,"" Buffett said. ""And it went to zero. And I gave about $400 million worth of Berkshire stock, which is probably now worth $400 billion. But I've made lots of dumb decisions. That's part of the game."" On his wallet . Buffett says he has been carrying the same wallet for 20 years. And when Morgan asked Buffett to show America what is inside, he obliged. He whipped out the black wallet for a split second. If you blinked you missed it. The highlights: A family picture. A wad of hundreds. And an American Express card from 1964. ""It goes with the cell phone,"" Buffett joked about the almost 50-year-old credit card. On the shutdown showdown . At least one part of the recent battle between Democrats and Republicans that caused a 16-day government shutdown should never happen again, Buffett says. The battle should not take place around whether to raise the debt ceiling limit, he said. It could be catastrophic to the economy. ""I think that both parties should declare the debt limit as a political weapon of mass destruction which can't be used,"" he said. ""I mean, it is silly to have a country that has 237 years building up its reputation and then have people threaten to tear it down because they're not getting some other matter."" On investment . Who wouldn't ask the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" who made his fortune investing, for a stock tip? Fans watching the interview needled Morgan via Twitter to ask the Nebraska billionaire how he would invest $1,000 right now. Buffett's answer: ""Well you asked,"" he coyly told Morgan. ""You've done your job."" It seems investment advice doesn't come easy. ""I can't even get an answer to that question,"" Howard Graham Buffett joked. Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- If you donated to a fund-raising campaign for the family of Cooper Harris, the suburban Atlanta toddler who died after being left in a hot car, you may soon be getting a refund. YouCaring.com, the site where the fundraising effort was hosted, has taken the campaign down, and a spokesman for one of the two payment processing firms used in the effort, PayPal, said Friday that it will refund all of the contributions it handled. The second firm, WePay.com, did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on its plans for donations it collected. Car bakes in Georgia sun for investigation into toddler's death . As of July 2, the effort had raised $22,677 of the $25,000 goal set by organizer Heather McCullar, according to a snapshot of the page maintained by Google. The page is no longer available on the YouCaring.com website. ""The campaign was recently removed from the site so that the controversy and debate surrounding the Harris matter did not become a distraction to the millions of other donors participating in a wide variety of active fundraisers currently taking place in our community,"" the company said in a statement. It was not immediately known how much each service had collected, or if any of the money had reached the Harris family. On June 21, Alabama Credit Union posted a note to its Facebook page saying donations were being funneled to an account there ""owned by Ms. Harris to use purely at her own discretion -- but she clearly understands the intent of those donating to the fund."" What's next in the case? The campaign was established after Cooper's father, Justin Ross Harris, was charged with murder and child cruelty in the June 18 death of his 22-month-old son. But it was posted before revelations that he had searched for information about hot-car deaths or bombshell allegations in a probable cause hearing last week that he had visited a website dedicated to a child-free lifestyle. A detective also said Harris was exchanging sexually explicit text messages with various women while his son was locked inside the sweltering car, painting a much different portrait of Harris than the dedicated and doting family man described by friends and family. Father apparently wrote 'I'm harmless' on social media profile . Harris has pleaded not guilty. In the preliminary hearing last week, Harris' attorney -- H. Maddox Kilgore -- said his client had tragically forgotten his child was in the car. On Friday a second Georgia law enforcement agency said it is now inquiring about Justin Ross Harris' activities. Woodstock Police Department has contacted Cobb County Police Department, ""in regards to any alleged criminal activity within our jurisdiction,"" Public Information Officer Brittany Duncan said. During the probable cause hearing, a detective with the Cobb County Police Department alleged Harris met one of the women with whom he exchanged explicit messages at Olde Rope Mill Park, in Woodstock. ""We have reached out to Cobb County and will coordinate with them on anything actionable,"" Duncan said. But at this point Woodstock Police say they don't have an active investigation. During the probable cause hearing, July 3, Cobb County Police Sgt. Phil Stoddard testified that the department's preliminary investigation had revealed Harris had committed the computer-based crime of sexual exploitation of a minor. When asked if Harris had also committed two misdemeanor violations of illegal contact with a minor, sexually -- Stoddard agreed he had. Calls to Harris' attorney, Maddox Kilgore, were not immediately returned. Who is Justin Ross Harris?

"Washington (CNN) -- No blood was spilled. But otherwise, a packed Senate hearing room Tuesday watched the political equivalent of a heavyweight fight. Top Senate Democrat Harry Reid sat just feet from rival Republican Leader Mitch McConnell for a rhetorical battle royal over campaign finance and Reid's push to change the Constitution to limit that spending. ""The Constitution doesn't give corporations a vote, and it doesn't give dollar bills a vote,"" said Reid. The Nevada Democrat is pushing for a Constitutional amendment to override the Supreme Court's 2010 ""Citizens United"" decision and allow Congress to set firm limits on independent and corporate campaign spending in federal elections. The proposal, sponsored by Democratic Sens. Tom Udall of New Mexico and Michael Bennet of Colorado, would also allow states to set more campaign limits in their elections. The Judiciary Committee hearing set up a rare side-by-side appearance by Reid and McConnell, two powerful leaders who are known for their sometimes bitter disagreements over process and policy in the Senate. The effect was electric as the hearing started. Hundreds of seated spectators craned their necks to see both men. As McConnell looked straight ahead at the panel of senators, Reid swung. ""Campaign finance reform has been proposed a number of times before -- even by my counterpart, Senator McConnell,"" Reid said. The Democratic leader pointed to the Republican's 1988 proposal that would have restricted some PAC and so-called ""soft-money"" contributions made to organizations. McConnell's office has said that the proposal was an alternative to a much more limiting campaign finance bill and insists he has not voted for any funding restrictions since. But Reid kept at it. ""Senator McConnell had the right idea (in 1988),"" he offered. The Nevada senator also employed his signature move in the debate, blasting conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, saying the brothers run 15 ""phantom"" or ""phony"" campaign funding organizations. Who are the Koch brothers? McConnell waited his turn. Reid finished but then surprised some in the room, indicating he would not stay to hear McConnell's response. Reid's office later told CNN that he had to give remarks at a meeting about mental health and suicide prevention. As he moved to leave, Reid joked that his Republican counterpart likely would not be upset by his departure. ""Nope, no problem,"" McConnell deadpanned. To scattered laughter, Reid exited. Then, the Republican punched back. ""Given how incredibly bad this amendment is, I can't blame my friend, the majority leader, from wanting to talk about the Koch Brothers or what I may have said over a quarter century ago,"" McConnell said. The Kentucky Republican jabbed at the proposal to give Congress control of campaign limits. He called it a threat to basic speech rights and then got to the basic disagreement of the debate: Whether limiting campaign dollars is also limiting speech. Supreme Court allows more private money in election campaigns . By setting spending rates, McConnell argued, Congress would choose who gets how much influence in politics. ""Not only would (this proposal) allow the government to favor some speakers over others, it would guarantee preferential treatment,"" McConnell argued. Other senators in the hearing soon rang in, exchanging quotes from the founding fathers and debating which political party was truly protecting free speech. ""This amendment is about power and it is about silencing citizens,"" boomed Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican of Texas. ""When did the (Democrats) abandon the Bill of Rights? ... This would give Congress the power to ban books and muzzle movies."" Members of the group Public Citizen, which opposes the ""Citizens United"" ruling that removed legal barriers preventing corporations and unions from spending unlimited sums on federal elections, laughed mockingly as Cruz spoke. A few rows ahead, some others shot them stern looks. 2014 Midterms: What's at stake . Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer responded directly to Cruz' strike at Democrats. ""I think if Thomas Jefferson were looking down at what's being proposed here, he would agree with it,"" Schumer said. The New Yorker noted that the Supreme Court has upheld some limits on speech, including restrictions on things like child pornography. He directly challenged the Texas tea party favorite. ""I want to ask you Sen. Cruz - are you against anti-child pornography laws?"" Schumer asked. At the time, Cruz was gone, voting on the Senate floor. When he returned, he was not pleased. ""I understand that in my absence Sen. Schumer very kindly gave a lecture on civility and encouraged me not to go over the top, while he then in the same breath accused me of supporting child pornography,"" Cruz told the committee sarcastically. ""So I appreciate that demonstration in senatorial restraint from the senior senator from New York."" The hearing was both a serious, powerful debate and an exercise in the tricky personal and political barbs that now litter the Senate. Attendance alone indicated the high stakes and interest in the topic -- with a long hallway full of people being sent to an overflow room to watch the hearing from the building next door. The subject has keen advantages to both political sides, both use it to stoke their bases. But while the hearing may have been high-interest, McConnell ultimately raised the bottom-line question: Where will this constitutional amendment push end up? ""Everybody on this committee knows this proposal is never going to pass Congress. This is a political exercise and that's all this is,"" McConnell told the committee. Democrats insist they will fight for the change, but there is no vote scheduled yet on the proposal and it is not clear when there could be one.

"(CNN) -- Scientists hailed a new method of making stem cells as a breakthrough. But questions about the data used for the two studies published in Nature in January have led one of the co-authors to call for a retraction. Researchers had said they could turn mature cells into embryonic-like stem cells by stressing them in various ways, such as by putting them in an acidic environment. The embryonic-like stem cells can then be coaxed into becoming any other kind of cell possible. This method, demonstrated using white blood cells of mice, could be faster and simpler than existing methods. Scientists called them STAP, or stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency, cells. Is it too good to be true? Study co-author Teruhiko Wakayama, professor at the University of Yamanashi in Japan, told Japanese public broadcaster NHK this week he's not confident anymore the experiments generated STAP cells. Doubts about the studies have been cropping up on blogs such as PubPeer in the weeks since their publication. The Riken Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan, said in February it was investigating ""alleged irregularities"" in research by Haruko Obokata, lead author of the studies who works at Riken, Nature reported. Upon reviewing test data, Wakayama discovered multiple problems, including ""questionable images,"" NHK reported. What's more, outside experts were unable to reproduce the findings of Wakayama's group; Riken then disclosed detailed methods of making the cells, NHK reported. Wakayama told NHK he has requested that his co-authors retract the studies and then would like outside experts to do verification studies. He said he is ""no longer sure about the credibility of the data used as preconditions for the experiments,"" NHK reported. A Riken official told The Japan News that ""the basis of the articles"" -- the fact that STAP cells were produced -- ""is unshakable."" In a statement, Riken said that more time is needed to submit final conclusions of the ongoing investigation. The center said it is also considering retraction. Dr. Charles Vacanti, a study co-author, said in a statement that he stands by the research. ""I firmly believe that the questions and concerns raised about our STAP cell paper published in Nature do not affect our findings or conclusions,"" said Vacanti, who is director of the Laboratory for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Harvard Medical School, with which Vacanti is also affiliated, said in a statement: ""We are fully committed to upholding the highest standards of ethics and to rigorously maintaining the integrity of our research. Any concerns brought to our attention are thoroughly reviewed in accordance with institutional policies and applicable regulations."" Stem cell breakthrough may be simple, fast, cheap . The thriving science of stem cell research seeks to develop therapies to repair bodily damage and cure disease by being able to insert cells that can grow into whatever tissues or organs are needed. Before the technique described in Nature, the leading candidates for creating stem cells artificially were those derived from embryos and stem cells from adult cells that require the insertion of DNA to become reprogrammable. Stem cells are created the natural way every time an egg that is fertilized begins to divide. During the first four to five days of cell division, so-called pluripotent stem cells develop. They have the ability to turn into any cell in the body. Removing stem cells from the embryo destroys it, making this type of research controversial because some say an embryo is a human life. Researchers have also developed a method of producing embryonic-like stem cells by taking a skin cell from a patient, for example, and adding a few bits of foreign DNA to reprogram the skin cell to become like an embryo and produce pluripotent cells, too. However, these cells are usually used for research because researchers do not want to give patients cells with extra DNA. The new method does not involve the destruction of embryos or insertion of new genetic material into cells, Vacanti said. It also avoids the problem of rejection: The body may reject stem cells from other people, but this method uses an individual's own mature cells. To study the STAP cell phenomenon, researchers first genetically altered mice donating stem cells to ""label"" those cells with the color green. For instance, they modified mice such that their cells would light up green in response to a particular wavelength of light. The scientists exposed blood cells from these genetically altered mice to an acidic environment. A few days later, they saw that these cells turned into the embryonic-like state and grew in spherical clusters. Scientists put the cell clusters into a mouse embryo that had not been genetically modified. It turned out, the implanted clusters could form tissues in all of the organs that the researchers tested. The scientists knew that the cells came from the original mouse because they turned green when exposed to a particular light. Besides modifying acidity, researchers also stressed the cells in other ways, such as lowering the oxygen environment and disrupting the cell membrane. Increasing acidity was one of the most effective methods of turning mouse blood cells into STAP cells. Among the unknowns about this technique are its effectiveness in humans, and what risks the method might pose. Vacanti told CNN in January he hopes the process could get tested clinically in humans within three years. He noted that induced pluripotent stem cells are already being explored in Japan in humans and the same ""platforms"" could be used for STAP cells.

"PYONGYANG, North Korea (CNN) -- North Korea handed over its long-awaited nuclear program declaration to officials from China on Thursday. Workers remove fuel rods on the reactor floor at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility this year. President Bush, who once branded North Korea as part of an ""axis of evil,"" welcomed the move and said he intends to remove the communist nation from the U.S. list of states that sponsor terrorism. ""The declaration says: 'We are not now engaged in any [uranium] enrichment activities or [nuclear] proliferation activities and will not engage in them in the future,'"" U.S. National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley said in Washington. ""It is a good first step in getting the kind of disclosure and transparency into North Korea's nuclear activities as part of and a step toward their disablement, dismantlement and termination of those activities,"" Hadley said. North Korea handed over the declaration to officials from China, which led the six-nation talks that hammered out the conditions of the agreement. In addition to China and the United States, the talks included South Korea, Japan and Russia.  Watch what's still unknown after Pyongyang's declaration » . Bush said he will call for the lifting of sanctions against North Korea under the Trading With the Enemy Act and notify Congress that he intends to take Pyongyang off the terror list. That move will take 45 days. But North Korea will have to end its nuclear activities in a ""verifiable"" way, Bush said in the White House Rose Garden. ""The United States has no illusions about the regime in Pyongyang,"" he said. ""We remain deeply concerned about North Korea's human rights abuses, uranium enrichment activities, nuclear testing and proliferation, ballistic missile programs and the threat it continues to pose to South Korea and its neighbors. ""Yet we welcome today's development as one step of a multistep process."" According to a senior U.S. State Department official, the 60-page declaration, written in English, details several rounds of plutonium production at Yongbyon, North Korea dating back to 1986. North Korea acknowledges producing roughly 40 kilograms of enriched plutonium -- enough for about seven nuclear bombs, the official said. The nation already has tested one nuclear bomb, which would have used about 6 kilograms of plutonium. After the declaration's submission, representatives from the United States and other members of the six-party talks will begin a process of verifying whether Pyongyang's declarations are true. Analyst John Wolfsthal of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said experts needed to be on the ground, taking samples and analyzing data. ""We don't trust North Korea; we don't take them at their word,"" said Wolfsthal, who has followed the secretive country for about two decades. ""We need to put together basically a jigsaw puzzle from pieces of data without really seeing the cover of the box,"" he said of North Korea's nuclear program. Hadley said the declaration also should provide details on how much plutonium North Korea says it has produced, which will allow the U.S. to calculate the size of Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal. Hadley said that information is not included in the declaration.  Watch why the plutonium question is so important » . The United States also needs to learn more about Pyongyang's previous nuclear activities, including the spread of nuclear technology and information to other countries, Hadley added. ""We have concerns about their past activities,"" Hadley said. ""We have made those concerns clear. The North Koreans acknowledge those concerns. That is what is ahead of us. ""In order for this process to go forward ... we are going to need to be able to get to the bottom of these issues, with respect to plutonium, enrichment, proliferation,"" he said. The easing of U.S. sanctions on North Korea will have little practical effect. ""North Korea will remain one of the most heavily sanctioned nations in the world,"" Bush said. The agreement includes additional monitoring to assure that Pyongyang receives promised economic and energy assistance in exchange for dismantling its nuclear program. Under the agreement, leaders in Pyongyang agreed to provide a full accounting of the plutonium, ""acknowledge"" concerns about its nuclear proliferation and uranium enrichment activities, and continue to cooperate with a process to ensure that no further activities are taking place. During negotiations, the United States ultimately softened demands that North Korea admit to having a highly enriched uranium program and supplying Syria with nuclear technology, sticking points that had stalled the talks for months. U.S. officials said the final deal wasn't perfect but offered Washington its best chance to learn about North Korea's nuclear activities. ""Multilateral diplomacy is the best way to peacefully resolve the nuclear issue,"" White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said. ""North Korea should seize this moment of opportunity to restore its relationship with the international community."" On Friday, North Korea is set to implode a cooling tower at its Yongbyon nuclear reactor. Nuclear experts have begun dismantling the plant's main reactor, but the destruction of the cooling tower is expected to be a powerful public symbol. And it is a step that would take North Korea more than a year to reverse, according to U.S. State Department officials. In a rare move, North Korea has invited international news organizations, including CNN, to witness the tower's destruction. The United States put North Korea on its state-sponsored terror list in January 1988 after its alleged involvement with the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner. The Korean Air Lines flight crashed into the Indian Ocean, killing all 115 people on board.

"(CNN) -- The indictment and possible trial of Texas Gov. Rick Perry for allegedly applying illegal coercion to a district attorney will complicate -- but not kill -- his all-but-certain run for President in 2016. It's a sure bet that voters outside of Texas will forgive, ignore or overlook any outcome short of a conviction. Perry wouldn't be the first modern presidential candidate to hit the trail with a scandal clanging in the background like noisy cans tied to the back of his campaign bus. But history suggests that a messy local political scene, with all its feuds and ethical shenanigans, is rarely a deal breaker on the national stage. Most biographies of Franklin D. Roosevelt, for example, focus on his stature as the architect of labor reforms and major New Deal programs such as Social Security, the Works Progress Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Few of the official histories note that Roosevelt's career began as an opponent -- and later, a staunch ally -- of the famously corrupt Democratic Party hierarchy in New York, centered at Tammany Hall, a clubhouse whose members freely trafficked in bribes, kickbacks, rigged government contracts and stolen elections. ""Roosevelt, in the end, came to Tammany. Tammany did not come to him,"" writes Terry Golway, author of ""Machine Made,"" a masterly work on the history of Tammany Hall. Years later, as President, Roosevelt confided to a friend that ""tens of thousands of people are members of Tammany Hall. I do not think they are all objectionable for that reason!"" That fundamental truth -- that local political machines, whatever their ethical shortcomings, are indispensable when it comes to winning elections -- was equally true for Roosevelt's vice president and successor, Harry Truman, who hailed from an even more flamboyantly corrupt political machine in Kansas City, Missouri. The city machine was run by a notorious leader, ""Boss Tom"" Pendergast, whose reign ended with a stint in federal prison. Truman never renounced his early patron, and attended Pendergast's funeral days after being sworn in as vice president. It's tempting to think ""that was then, this is now"" since Roosevelt and Truman operated in the days before television brought politics into nearly every American home. But consider what happened when -- decades before Watergate -- Richard Nixon weathered a scandal shortly after being named running mate to Dwight Eisenhower in 1952. Journalists had discovered that the then-senator accepted money and personal gifts from a campaign fund financed by group of conservative businessmen, leading to widespread calls for Nixon to resign from the Republican ticket. Typical of the negative tone was one paper, The Sacramento Bee, that blasted Nixon as ""the pet and protÃ©gÃ©, the subsidized front man"" for a ""special interest group of rich Southern Californians."" Nixon answered the critics by seizing upon the still-new technology of television to deliver what's now known as the ""Checkers"" speech. (Nixon, staring into the cameras, said the only personal gift he'd received from the fund was a beloved dog, Checkers, that he had no intention of selling or returning.) Nixon also asked for -- and received -- a popular wave of calls from voters to GOP officials telling them to leave Nixon alone. The Checkers speech, delivered to what was then the largest broadcast audience in history, not only showed the power of a direct appeal to the people, it also demonstrated the public's ability to look beyond the sometimes tawdry details of local politics and focus on the major issues of the day. Voters accepted Lyndon Johnson as a vice president and later President despite widespread rumors that his election to the U.S. Senate in 1948 by a razor-thin, 87-vote margin was stolen with the help of corrupt Texas political bosses -- charges confirmed decades after the fact by biographer Robert Caro. And in 1992 when it turned out that presidential candidate Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, had ties to an ethically stinky, failed land development deal called Whitewater, voters shrugged it off and made him leader of the free world. No matter how much outrage Clinton's enemies tried to stir up over Whitewater, it never took hold with the voting public, which returned Clinton to the presidency for a second term. This is not to suggest that Perry's local troubles won't have a national impact. His indictment may scare away some potential supporters, making it harder for him to line up donations and early political support in this crucial pre-election season. And a conviction -- highly unlikely but possible -- would surely end Perry's presidential hopes. But the mere fact of a local political squabble casting a shadow on Perry's image ultimately won't automatically knock him out of the running. Far more important will be avoiding debate gaffes such as the famous ""oops"" incident in 2012 and making headway in early presidential states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, where Perry is currently mired in single digits in the polls. It may not be much comfort to his supporters, but from the standpoint of presidential politics, Perry is pretty much the same candidate he was before the legal papers got served: a long shot with a tough road ahead of him.","Errol Louis: Rick Perry's indictment will complicate, not kill, his chances in 2016 .

"(CNN) -- Anti-government protesters have managed to breach a high-security zone in Pakistan's capital, despite the presence of thousands of security personnel. A blackout had been enforced overnight Tuesday in Islamabad's ""red zone,"" a heavily guarded area of the city containing key government buildings, as the marchers drew close. In the darkness policemen thumped their shields with batons in anticipation of a possible confrontation. However they told CNN orders had been given not to react or use force. For the past few days, thousands of supporters of cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan have joined a march on Islamabad from Lahore to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif amid claims of vote-rigging during last year's election. They've been joined by followers of outspoken cleric Tahir ul Qadri, who declared the protest a ""revolution march."" Qadri led protests against the government last year that brought the capital to a standstill, and has accused Sharif of corruption and campaigned for more to be done for the country's poor. OPINION: Qadri: My vision for Pakistan . Sharif has denied the accusations against him, and has offered to set off an investigation into last year's vote. Parliament reached . Many of Khan and Qadri's supporters were equipped with gas masks and swimming goggles and carried thick wooden clubs. By late Tuesday, many had managed to get beyond barricades made up of barbed wire and steel shipping containers -- with some even using a hijacked crane -- to reach parliament without provoking a reaction from security forces. At one point a number of female protesters approached soldiers and appeared to shower them in flower petals. Officials had previously warned protesters not to enter this area, prompting fears of violent clashes. Earlier this month, at least five people died when supporters of Qadri clashed with police in the northwestern Punjab province. However a spokesperson for the military released the following statement on social media Tuesday: ""Buildings in the Red Zone are a symbol of the state and are being protected by the Army. Therefore the sanctity of these national symbols must be respected. Situation requires patience, wisdom & sagacity from all stakeholders to resolve prevailing impasse through meaningful dialogue in larger national and public interest."" Qadri told CNN that this ""green revolution"" had been ""peaceful and democratic."" He added: ""This is a march for democratic reforms. We want rule of law. We want true participatory democracy in our country. We want to fight for human rights, for minority rights, for women rights and to eradicate corruption from society."" At around 1 a.m. local time on Wednesday, a handful of supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) political party were the first to breach the final container blocking access to the front of the prime minister's secretariat.

"(CNN) -- A Mexican petition that would have granted deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya safe conduct out of the country was rejected by Honduran authorities because it did not meet legal standards, Honduran Government Minister Oscar Raul Matute told CNN en Español. Zelaya has been holed up in the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa since September 21. In the letter, obtained by CNN, Mexico asks the de facto Honduran government to guarantee Zelaya's safety from the embassy to the airport, where a Mexican Gulfstream III jet would fly his family to Mexico. The Mexican embassy in Honduras ""has the honor of informing that the government of the United Mexican States has decided to receive on its territory"" Zelaya, his wife, two children and one of his advisers, the letter states. ""The embassy petitions the ministry (of foreign relations) to provide safe conduct so that the above Honduran nationals may leave Honduran territory safely, with respect of their persons and without being detained or otherwise harassed,"" the letter states. Matute said the letter did not meet the necessary standards because it made no mention of under what legal status Mexico would accept Zelaya and his family. The Honduran foreign ministry said it would consider future petitions from Mexico or any other countries, as long as they met the accepted legal standards for a request of political asylum. The letter submitted by Mexico makes no mention of granting Zelaya political asylum or any other legal status. The omission may not be accidental. In an interview with CNN en Español, Zelaya said he is still the legitimate president of Honduras, and as such, would not ask for, or accept political asylum. If he leaves Honduras for another country, it would have to be as a ""guest,"" Zelaya said. Zelaya did not say whether he was negotiating to leave. Rasel Tome, the Zelaya adviser who was named in the letter, said negotiators for Zelaya had spoken with presidents in several Latin American and Caribbean countries Wednesday, including Mexico. The goal of the conversations was to ""find a way out of the crisis,"" Tome said. In a statement, Mexico's foreign ministry said its request was made with the support of allies and political actors in Honduras. ""Our country seeks to contribute to rapprochement in Honduras, taking a positive step towards resolving the crisis in that country through dialogue and negotiation,"" the statement said. Zelaya was ousted in a June 28 coup. After spending months in exile, Zelaya snuck back into Honduras in September, and has not left the Brazilian embassy. His return was an effort to restart talks to negotiate his return as president. That never happened. An agreement was eventually signed, but its implementation has been half-hearted, and Zelaya later called the deal dead. The latest setback for the ousted president was a congressional vote, mandated by the agreement, on whether to reinstate Zelaya. Congress voted overwhelmingly against reinstatement. The same body had voted to install congressional leader Roberto Micheletti as interim president. Zelaya's supporters argued that the coup was an illegal act that only restitution could heal. Congress sought opinions from the nation's Supreme Court and other bodies before holding the vote. The court ruled that Zelaya cannot return to office without facing trial on charges that he acted unconstitutionally when he tried to hold a vote that could have led to the removal of presidential term limits. The Supreme Court ruled before the coup that the vote was illegal and Congress had forbidden it. The coup came on the day the term-limits vote was to have been held. Micheletti and his supporters have insisted that Zelaya's removal was a constitutional transfer of power, not a coup. But the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the European Union and most nations -- including the United States -- condemned the coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated immediately.","Honduran authorities: Request does not meet legal standards .

"New York (CNN) -- An upstate New York church is giving new meaning to the biblical passage, ""My peace I give unto you."" In this case, it's a piece: an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Grace Baptist Church in Troy -- about two and half hours north of Manhattan -- is giving away the semi-automatic rifle as part of a special event honoring hunters and gun owners later this month. The church website entices gun lovers with the words ""Win a Free AR-15"" followed by the New Testament line. The holder of the winning ticket will receive an AR-15 modified for sale in New York state. ""Does the Bible defend my right to keep and bear arms?"" says a promotional flier on the church website. In a letter to his congregation, Pastor John Koletas said: ""Our country was built with the King James Bible and the gun."" The winner will be named during a March 23 service dedicated to ""hunters and gun owners who have been so viciously attacked by the antichristian socialist media and antichristian socialist politicians the last few years."" New York Assemblyman Steve McLaughlin, a Republican, will speak at the service. McLaughlin told CNN that the event complied with New York gun laws. He said that he speaks regularly at events supporting Second Amendment rights. While the church venue for such an event may be unusual, McLaughlin said many upstate New York pastors carry guns. They are law-abiding, church-going citizens, he said. Michael Collins, pastor of Brunswick Baptist Church in Troy, somewhat agreed with the legislator. ""It is not something that we would do,"" he said, ""but we have plenty of gun owners in the church, and it is our constitutional right to do so."" It is not uncommon for churches to host ""outdoorsmen"" events and give away guns, Collins said. To qualify to win the AR-15, one has to be 18 or older, have a driver's license and be able to pass a background check to buy a gun, according to the pastor's letter. The church reserves the right to disqualify anyone it deems of ""questionable character"" from winning the rifle, according to the letter. Oakwood Trading Post, a local gun store, will conduct a background check on the winner before turning over the rifle, according to the store's owner, Brian Olesen. The AR-15, valued at $700, was purchased by Grace Baptist and is being held at the gun store, Olesen said. The semi-automatic rifle has a 10-round magazine capacity, and the trigger must be activated for every shot fired, Olesen said. In 2013, a federal court ruled that a New York gun law restricting the sale of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines was constitutional. The law was passed after the mass shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school. Armed with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six school staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012, before taking his own life. Earlier, he had killed his mother inside their home. Grace Baptist Church and Koletas did not return calls seeking comment.","Upstate New York church to give away an AR-15 rifle .

"(CNN) -- Nearly a decade after she was rescued from a remote Antarctic research station after diagnosing herself with breast cancer, Dr. Jerri Nielsen died early Tuesday, her brother said. She was 57. Jerri Nielsen treated herself for breast cancer while stationed at the South Pole in 1999. Nielsen had been fighting the latest round of cancer for the past five years, brother Eric Cahill said. She died just before 4 a.m. in Massachusetts, surrounded by her family, he said. ""She would want to be remembered for the adventure and, you know, living every day, and not just the sickness,"" said sister-in-law Diana Cahill. ""She was very much active and still even doing talks as late as March of this year. Then the last month or so, she was pretty sick."" Nielsen caught the nation's attention in 1999, when she found a lump in her breast as a 47-year-old physician stationed at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Station. After finding the lump in June, she diagnosed herself with breast cancer and began treating herself using chemotherapy agents that the U.S. Air Force parachuted to the station the next month. It was later revealed, according to a March 2009 article in the Detroit Free Press newspaper, that Nielsen -- an emergency room doctor from Cleveland, Ohio -- performed a biopsy on herself with the help of non-medical crew, who practiced using needles on a raw chicken. While treating herself, Nielsen carried on her duties as the sole doctor for the 41-person research group. She consulted with her doctors in the United States by e-mail and teleconference. They recommended that she return as soon as possible for treatment. Although flights in support of the South Pole program don't usually begin until late October or early November, the start of Antarctic spring, it was October 6 when two planes set out on what was dubbed Operation Deep Freeze. Ten days and a handful of stops later -- California, Hawaii, Pago Pago, New Zealand and then Antarctica -- rescuers braved temperatures of nearly minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit to land a ski-equipped plane at the pole, drop off a replacement doctor and pick up Nielsen. It was the earliest such flight attempted. Once she returned home and was treated, Nielsen's cancer went into remission, and she wrote about her experience in a best-selling book, ""Icebound."" She married and became a public speaker, Diana Cahill said. But in 2005, Nielsen's cancer returned in her bones and liver, later spreading to her brain. ""My experience at the pole had to do with accepting things that most people fear most deeply and coming to feel that they need not be feared,"" Nielsen told Psychology Today magazine in 2006. ""It certainly had far more to do with peace and surrender than it did with courage. Being 'on the ice' was a great good fortune: It created a much greater clarity for me about what was essential in life. ""I'm not afraid of death. I've come to accept it as being part of life, and I think I've come to accept it earlier than my years because of what's happened to me."" She said that after learning her cancer had returned, ""after about three weeks of going through a kind of terror, I felt the most incredible peace come over me. Now I am very happy and excited about going forward with my life. The metastatic disease is now just another part of me, another thing that has happened to me."" ""She was always upbeat,"" Diana Cahill said. ""She never really dwelled upon her illness. She told people to live every day, and it was about what kind of life you lived. She was really inspirational to a lot of people around the world."" In October 2008, Nielsen spoke at the University of Toledo College of Medicine, formerly her alma mater the Medical College of Ohio, according to the Free Press. She took off her wig to show students her bald head, the newspaper said, and told them not to be discouraged: ""There is no end of life until your last breath. We can all do something to help someone."" She told the Free Press in March that the cancer had spread to her brain but still displayed her inspiring grit. ""I'm not as smart a girl as I used to be,"" she told the newspaper. ""I'm not as hard a worker, that's for sure. But I'm still doing everything, I'm writing a book and giving speeches, and I'm really having a beautiful winter."" Nielsen told Psychology Today, ""The things that make you strong, and make you feel as though you've accomplished something, are not the easy ones; it's the things you had to work and struggle through. Those are what give us our depth -- that make us not gray and plain and nothing but give us depth and texture and longing. ""I believe you're always much better off knowing what the real truth is. I think it's only then that you can come to grips with your illness, or with any difficult situation. Some people call this process 'mourning.' I prefer to call it tiring of the fear and the depression and the denial, and the fake optimism and the irritation of it all -- and just saying, 'Hey, I'm tired of feeling bad about this. Now I go on.' "" CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Nielsen was stationed at South Pole in 1999, diagnosed self with breast cancer .

"(CNN) -- A manhunt was under way Wednesday for a man suspected of killing three people and wounding seven others, some critically, in a workplace shooting in Cupertino, California, and of a subsequent attempted carjacking nearby. Police identified the suspect as Shareff Allman and said he is about 45 years old. However, CNN affiliate KGO reported the man's first name was spelled Shareef. The shooting occurred about 4:15 a.m. (7:15 a.m. ET) at the Permanente Quarry, said Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith. Authorities believe Allman entered a meeting, armed with a handgun and an assault rifle, and opened fire. Two people died at the scene, Smith said, and a third was pronounced dead later at a hospital. According to Santa Clara County sheriff's Sgt. Jose Cardoza, witnesses reported the incident lasted ""no more than two minutes."" At about 7 a.m. (10 a.m. ET), Allman was believed to be involved in an attempted carjacking on the Hewlett-Packard campus in Cupertino, about five miles away from the quarry, Smith said. A woman was shot and sustained non-life-threatening injuries. The suspect did not obtain the woman's car, the sheriff said. He is believed to have fled on foot. Cardoza said earlier the weapon used in the attempted carjacking was a handgun similar to that used in the workplace shooting. Authorities found Allman's vehicle at a service station close to the site of the attempted carjacking, Smith said. Police recovered a shotgun, a handgun and two assault rifles, she said. Residents of the area in suburban San Jose have been alerted that a suspect is at large, Smith said. Many schools in the area were closed and Cupertino's emergency operations center was activated. Allman is believed to be armed and dangerous, Smith said. She described him as a ""disgruntled employee"" of the quarry. He has a ""minor criminal record,"" the sheriff said, with the latest incident in 1996. Authorities have been in touch with Allman's family, she said. KGO reported that Allman is a community television host who regularly preaches about non-violence. Hewlett-Packard asked employees at the Cupertino campus not to report to work Wednesday, KGO reported. HP said in a statement the woman injured in the attempted carjacking was an HP contract employee and was in stable condition at a hospital, the station said.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Some families long separated by the Korean War saw their loved ones Saturday for the first time in years near the border between North and South Korea. South Korean Yoon Ki-Dal, right, meets the children he left behind as babies during the Korean War. Yoon Ki-Dal, 88, of South Korea thought such a moment would never come. After leaving his son and daughters when they were babies during the Korean War, he was able to hold the hands of his North Korean children on Saturday. ""Father, we thought you were dead,"" his daughter, now in her 60s, told him, her face trembling. Their family was one of 97 reunited Saturday on Mount Keumgang, a North Korean resort near the eastern part of the border, after decades of separation by war and ideology. And soon these families will be separated again. They are allowed to be together for a few days. Then the South Koreans must return home. The reunions -- the first in nearly two years -- are taking place through October 1. Millions of families were separated by the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a cease-fire and no formal peace treaty. No mail, telephone or e-mail exchanges exist between ordinary citizens across the Korean border. The agreement to hold the reunions came after North and South Korea held three days of talks, mediated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, last month, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported at the time. About 10,000 people applied to take part in the reunion, but fewer than 200 families were allowed to participate. In addition to the 97 families who met Saturday, another 99 families are expected to meet next week, authorities said.  Watch families share hugs, tears » . Participants are selected randomly, and there is no date set for a further reunion, which means the tens of thousands of others who were separated by the Korean War have no idea when they may get a chance to see their loved ones -- if ever. For the many separated family members who are elderly, a reunion may never be possible. Reunions between North and South have been taking place off and on since 2000 after an inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang, Yonhap says. The last reunion took place in October 2007. Rapprochement talks between the two Koreas have hit a wall since conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008 with a tougher stance toward the North than his liberal predecessor, Roh Moo-Hyun. The two Koreas have remained in conflict since the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953. Last month, officials from both sides had the first high-level, cross-border contact in nearly two years when South Korean Unification Minister Hyun In Taek met with North Korean unity leader Kim Yang Gon. The meetings and reunions are in stark contrast to the tense public statements each side made about each other earlier this year. Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan, also referred to as the East Sea. The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened U.S. and South Korean ships near its territorial waters. South Korea condemned the action, calling the launches ""unwise."" Journalist Sohn Jie-Ae contributed to this report.","Families have reunion meeting at resort in North Korea, near border .

"Washington (CNN) -- Is it a model for bipartisan governance or a short-term solution that only hardened long-held positions? Democrats and Republicans had wildly different takes on Thursday on the agreement passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama that ended the 16-day partial shutdown of the government and averted a possible U.S. default. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers returned to their jobs across the country and national monuments such as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis reopened under the agreement considered a victory for Obama because it lacked substantive changes to his signature health care reforms targeted by conservatives. In a tough and somber statement, the President challenged the Republican right to drop its anti-government ideology and change how business gets done in Washington. The standoff ""inflicted completely unnecessary damage (to) our economy"" by slowing growth and increasing borrowing costs, Obama said, declaring that ""there are no winners here."" At the same time, he blamed the brinksmanship that flirted with the first default in U.S. history on no-compromise tactics of the Republican tea party wing in Congress, saying that ""the American people are completely fed up with Washington."" ""Let's work together to make government work better instead of treating it like an enemy or purposely making it work worse,"" Obama said in a direct jab at tea party conservatives. ""You don't like a particular policy or a particular president? Then argue for your position. Go out there and win an election,"" he added. ""Push to change it, but don't break it"" because ""that's not being faithful to what this country's about."" Saying ""we can't degenerate into hatred,"" he ended by quoting part of the Pledge of Allegiance that states America is ""one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."" But an aide to Sen. Ted Cruz, who led the tea party charge to tie continued government funding to derailing Obamacare, told CNN's Dana Bash late on Thursday the Texas Republican was not ruling anything in or out about a possible shutdown early next year around the next big fiscal deadlines. While no other Republican leaders offered on-the-record reaction, a senior GOP congressional aide told Bash that ""the President's comments are not designed to help this process, only to lay blame in advance""of upcoming congressional battles over the budget, immigration reform and other issues. The congressional stalemate ended when Republicans caved to the insistence of Obama and Democrats that legislation funding the government and raising the federal borrowing limit should be free -- or at least mostly free -- from partisan issues and tactics. After all the bickering and grandstanding, the billions lost and trust squandered, the result amounted to much ado about nothing. Hardline Republicans, whose opposition to Obama's signature health care reforms set the shutdown and debt ceiling crisis in motion, got pretty much zip -- except maybe marred reputations. ""To say we as Republicans left a lot on the table would be one of the biggest understatements in American political history,"" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina tweeted. The agreement amounted to the cliched kicking of the can down the road, because the deal passed by Congress in lightning fashion Wednesday night and signed by Obama in the wee hours of Thursday only funds the government through January 15 and raises the debt ceiling until February 7. Read the bill . It also set up budget negotiations between the GOP-led House and Democratic-led Senate intended to reach a broader agreement on funding the government for the fiscal year that ends on September 30. Ideally, a budget compromise would ensure government funding and include deficit reduction provisions that would prevent another round of default-threatening brinksmanship in three months' time. Dialogue started . On Thursday, leaders of the House and Senate budget committees -- Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington -- held a symbolic breakfast to get the dialogue started. They noted that their negotiations -- called a conference between their two committees to work out differences in budgets passed by each chamber -- differed from a special committee set up under 2011 legislation that failed to agree on broader deficit reduction steps. ""Chairman Ryan knows I'm not gonna vote for his budget. I know that he's not gonna vote for mine,"" Murray told reporters, saying the goal was to find ""the common ground between our two budgets that we both can vote on."" In his statement to reporters Thursday, Obama repeated his call for Congress to now take a ""balanced approach"" on a budget for the rest of the current fiscal year that would ""cut out things we don't need,"" ""close corporate tax loopholes that don't create jobs,"" and ""free up resources for things that do help the country grow,"" like research and infrastructure. He also said Congress should pass immigration reforms proposed by the Senate and complete work on a farm bill caught in partisan wrangling. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the House vote to pass the spending and debt ceiling agreement Wednesday showed the possibility of bipartisan governance, with the Democratic minority joined by enough Republicans to surpass the 217-vote threshold required. However, that outcome only came under immense pressure on House Republicans after their partisan proposals seeking to link provisions dismantling or defunding Obamacare were rejected by the Democratic-led Senate and the President. House Speaker John Boehner's spokesman said the Ohio Republican sought a ""step-by-step"" process to address the immigration issue, which was Washington code for rejecting Obama's comprehensive approach that would offer immigrants living illegally in the country a pathway to legal status. Conservatives call that amnesty, and a senior GOP aide told CNN that ""the President's attitude and actions over the past few weeks have almost certainly poisoned the well on immigration, at least for now."" Why is Ted Cruz smiling? Back to work . Before Obama spoke Thursday, federal employees returning to work got muffins from Vice President Joe Biden and hugs from colleagues, along with eye rolls about their ""vacation"" due to the shutdown. ""I am happy it's ended,"" Biden said when he arrived at the Environmental Protection Agency with the muffins handed out to returning workers. ""It was unnecessary to begin with."" In the basement of the Capitol, there were exuberant hugs as furloughed colleagues were welcomed back, but there was also bitterness toward the elected legislators in charge upstairs. A common refrain was the sarcastic question: ""How was your vacation?"" Responses were often nonverbal -- an eye roll, a head shake, an angry glare, the occasional ironic laugh. Zakaria: Conservatives should lighten up . Had Congress not approved a debt limit increase, the government would have lost its authority to borrow more money to pay all of its bills. Social Security checks and veterans' benefits could have stopped. The markets could have gone into a tailspin. Approval of the temporary spending plan meant the return to work of more than 800,000 furloughed employees, while more than 1 million others who've been working without pay will get paychecks again. A provision in the agreement guaranteed back pay for government workers for the shutdown. What's open for business again . Last-minute save . However, the measure doesn't address many of the contentious and complicated issues that continue to divide Democrats and Republicans, such as changes to entitlement programs and tax reform. ""We think that we'll be back here in January debating the same issues,"" John Chambers, managing director of Standard and Poor's rating service, told CNN on Wednesday night. ""This is, I fear, a permanent feature of our budgetary process."" At the White House, Carney hoped the outcome of the shutdown showdown -- with Republicans getting little in return for the public anger leveled mostly at them for causing it -- would revise how things worked. ""It's a new day, and maybe that dynamic will change,"" he said. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, credited with brokering the agreement with his Democratic counterpart, Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, said in published interviews Thursday there would be no further government shutdowns. Pork in the bill: The 5 most surprising provisions in the debt deal . A $24 billion battle . The partial government shutdown came at a steep cost. Standard and Poor's estimated it took a $24 billion bite out of the economy. Then there's the impact it had on politicians' image. If there's one thing polls showed that Americans agreed on, it's that they don't trust Congress -- with Republicans bearing more blame than anyone else for what transpired. What did GOP win on Obamacare? Not much . While some Republicans, such as tea party favorite Cruz, claimed moral victories in energizing their movement, Boehner didn't even pretend his side came out victorious. ""We fought the good fight; we just didn't win,"" Boehner told a radio station in his home state of Ohio. Cruz, despite being in the Senate, is credited with spearheading the House Republican effort to attach amendments that would have dismantled or defunded Obamacare. Republicans did get a small Obamacare concession: requiring the government to confirm the eligibility of people receiving federal subsidies under the health care program. However, Republican leaders said dismantling or defunding Obamacare was never going to happen and they criticized Cruz and his tea party cohorts for essentially causing the unpopular shutdown over that effort. GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the Cruz tactic ""an ill-conceived strategy from the beginning, not a winning strategy."" How the House voted . How the Senate voted . 'Never again' Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich predicts the tea party and staunch conservatives in the GOP will be more energized after not getting the anti-Obamacare amendments they wanted. ""They will be more embittered, more angry. They will find more ways to go after Obama because they can't find any way to get him to negotiate,"" he said, adding that he expects Obamacare to become the defining issue of the next two elections cycles.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- A South Korean fishing boat and its four crew members were heading home Saturday after being held for a month in North Korea, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. South Korean fishing boats anchored at Geojin port, Goseong, South Korea, August 1. The Yeonan-ho and its crew were handed over to a South Korean patrol boat waiting at the sea border Saturday evening, Yonhap reported, citing South Korean maritime police. North Korean officials captured the vessel and its crew July 30 after the boat strayed deep into North Korean territorial waters, North's Korean Central News Agency reported at the time. South Korea's Defense and Unification Ministry said the 29-ton vessel had been returning from its fishing operations and mistakenly crossed seven miles into North Korean waters in the process, according to Yonhap. South and North Korea have remained in conflict since the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953. The war ended in a truce but no formal peace treaty was ever signed. Rapprochement talks between the two sides hit a wall after conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008. He had a tougher stance toward the North than his liberal predecessor, Roh Moo-Hyun. Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan. The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened the United States and South Korean ships near its territorial waters. Several steps in the past week have hinted at a thaw in relations, however. Last week, the two sides had the first high-level, cross-border contact in nearly two years. On Friday, the countries reached an agreement on future reunions for families separated for decades by the Korean War. The agreement on reunions came after three days of talks between the two sides, mediated by the Red Cross, in North Korea, Yonhap reported. Reunions will be held from September 26 to October 1 at Mt. Keumgang, Yonhap reported.","Reunions for divided families to be held from September 26 to October 1 .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- North and South Korea will hold three days of talks on reunions for families torn apart by the Korean War and divisions between the two countries, South Korea's Unification Ministry said Tuesday. North Korean Yun Young-Seob hugs his South Korean sister Yun Bok-Seob at a 2007 reunion in North Korea. The talks, which begin Wednesday, will be the first on the subject in almost two years. The International Red Cross said it was sending delegates to mediate the talks, which will be held at the Mount Keumgang resort in North Korea. North Korea was also to schedule an early-October reunion for families across the peninsula who where separated in the aftermath of the Korean War, KCNA reported earlier this month. Rapprochement talks between the two sides have hit a wall since conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008 with a tougher stance toward the North than his liberal predecessor, Roh Moo-Hyun. Tuesday's announcement was the latest sign of potential thawing in the icy relationship between the two Koreas, which have technically remained in conflict since the Korean War ended in 1953. The Korean conflict ended in a truce, but no formal peace treaty was ever signed. Lee met last week, prior to the funeral of former South Korean President Kim Dai-jung, with a visiting North Korean delegation, who delivered a message from Kim Jong Il expressing hopes for improved relations between the two countries. Although the president reiterated his firm stance on North Korea, South Korean Unification Minister Hyun In Taek met with North Korean unity leader Kim Yang Gon on Saturday. The meetings between officials of the two Koreas are in stark contrast to the tense public statements they made about each other earlier this year. Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan. The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened the United States and South Korean ships near its territorial waters. South Korea condemned the action, calling the launches ""provocative"" and ""unwise."" South Korea is expected to make a second attempt to launch its first satellite later Tuesday after aborting a launch last week when a piece of equipment malfunctioned minutes before launch. Earlier this month, South Korea responded positively, but cautiously, to a joint agreement announced Monday between North Korea and the South's Hyundai Group to resume cross-border tourism, ease border controls and facilitate cross-border family reunions. Unification Ministry spokesman Chun Hae-sung said that the two sides needed to reach an agreement through direct talks. A Hyundai subsidiary handles all tourism and business projects between the Koreas. The announcement of the agreement followed a weekend meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and Hyundai chairwoman Hyun Jeong-eun. Under the agreement, South Korean tourists would again be able to travel north across the border to Mt. Keumgang, a popular resort in the communist nation, North Korea's state-run KCNA reported. Tours to Keumgang were halted in July 2008 after North Korean soldiers killed a South Korean tourist who strayed into a restricted area.

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Friday vetoed a bill that would allow same-sex couples to wed, setting up a confrontation with a Democrat-controlled legislature that has vowed to eventually get the bill into law. The General Assembly on Thursday passed the measure, which the Senate had approved Monday. Lawmakers have until the legislative session ends in January 2014 to override Christie's veto. They would need a two-thirds majority in both houses to succeed. Christie, the subject of speculation as a possible GOP vice presidential candidate, has said the issue ""should not be decided by 121 people in the statehouse in Trenton."" He has advocated putting the issue to a referendum. ""I continue to encourage the Legislature to trust the people of New Jersey and seek their input by allowing our citizens to vote on a question that represents a profoundly significant societal change,"" Christie said in a statement. ""I have been just as adamant that same-sex couples in a civil union deserve the very same rights and benefits enjoyed by married couples, as well as the strict enforcement of those rights and benefits."" Recent polling, meanwhile, suggests that New Jersey voters are slightly in favor of legalizing such marriages. Fifty-two percent of state voters approve the measure, the first time the figures have crossed the 50% threshold, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. The study includes a margin of error of 2.6 percentage points. Gay rights groups, which had expected the governor's veto, have pledged to override it. ""By vetoing the bill that would ensure that all loving, committed New Jersey couples and their families can share in the freedom to marry, with all its protections and meaning, Governor Christie planted his feet firmly on the wrong side of history, said Evan Wolfson, president of the group Freedom to Marry, which had lobbied in favor of the bill. New Jersey currently allows for civil unions, which Christie says he supports. With Hawaii and Delaware joining the list last month, five other states currently recognize such unions. A similar battle is also shaping up in Maryland, where Gov. Martin O'Malley -- a Democrat -- has pushed for his state to join the seven others that allow same-sex couples to marry. On Friday, the Maryland House of Delegates voted 71-67 to legalize same-sex marriage. But no Senate vote has been set, and opponents of the measure have pressed to take the matter to a statewide referendum. Washington state, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Iowa, New York and the District of Columbia currently allow such marriages.","Gov. Chris Christie on Friday vetoed the bill .

"(CNN) -- Hawaii's legislature gave final passage to a measure Tuesday to make it the 16th American state to legalize same-sex marriage. ""With today's vote, Hawaii joins a growing number of states that recognize that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters should be treated fairly and equally under the law,"" President Obama, a native Hawaiian, said in a statement. Illinois is poised to become the 15th state when its governor signs a same-sex marriage bill given final passage by its General Assembly last week. Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn has said he would ""put our state on the right side of history"" by signing it November 20. Hawaii's Gov. Neil Abercrombie will sign the legislation Wednesday morning. The law is set to take effect on December 2. ""Whenever freedom and equality are affirmed, our country becomes stronger,"" Obama said. ""By giving loving gay and lesbian couples the right to marry if they choose, Hawaii exemplifies the values we hold dear as a nation. I've always been proud to have been born in Hawaii, and today's vote makes me even prouder. And Michelle and I extend our best wishes to all those in Hawaii whose families will now be given the security and respect they deserve."" In addition to Hawaii and Illinois, same-sex marriage is legal in 14 states -- California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington -- as well as the District of Columbia. Colorado and Hawaii allow civil unions. Same-sex marriage is banned in every state not mentioned above, except for New Mexico, which has no laws banning or allowing it. Proponents of same-sex marriage say they have momentum on their side. In June, the Supreme Court rejected parts of the Defense of Marriage Act in a 5-4 decision, dismissing an appeal over same-sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds and ruling same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. It also ruled that private parties did not have standing to defend California's voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock, clearing the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume. But opponents say the fight is far from over. Shortly before the Illinois votes, the president of the National Organization for Marriage urged people to contact their state representatives to tell them they support marriage as the union of one man and one woman. ""We've seen how marriage redefinition leads to those who believe in traditional marriage being punished, labeled 'bigots' and 'haters' in the public square, and forced to be silent about their deeply held beliefs or face repercussions. And their children? They're taught in schools that the values planted in them at home are bigoted and outdated, the equivalent of racism!"" Brian Brown wrote in a blog post. Worldwide, 16 other countries (and parts of Mexico) also have laws allowing same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships. Most of these are in Europe and South America.","Hawaii's same-sex marriage law is set to take effect on June 1, 2014 .

"(WIRED) -- A judge on Monday ordered a Colorado woman to decrypt her laptop computer so prosecutors can use the files against her in a criminal case. The defendant, accused of bank fraud, had unsuccessfully argued that being forced to do so violates the Fifth Amendment's protection against compelled self-incrimination. ""I conclude that the Fifth Amendment is not implicated by requiring production of the unencrypted contents of the Toshiba Satellite M305 laptop computer,"" Colorado U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn ruled Monday (.pdf). The authorities seized the laptop from defendant Ramona Fricosu in 2010 with a court warrant while investigating financial fraud. The case is being closely watched (.pdf) by civil rights groups, as the issue has never been squarely weighed in on by the Supreme Court. Full disk encryption is an option built into the latest flavors of Windows, Mac OS and Linux, and well-designed encryption protocols used with a long passphrase can take decades to break, even with massive computing power. The government had argued that there was no Fifth Amendment breach, and that it might ""require significant resources and may harm the subject computer"" if the authorities tried to crack the encryption. Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia Davies said in a court filing (.pdf) that if Judge Blackburn did not rule against the woman, that would amount to ""a concession to her and potential criminals (be it in child exploitation, national security, terrorism, financial crimes or drug trafficking cases) that encrypting all inculpatory digital evidence will serve to defeat the efforts of law enforcement officers to obtain such evidence through judicially authorized search warrants, and thus make their prosecution impossible."" A factually similar dispute involving child pornography ended with a Vermont federal judge ordering the defendant to decrypt the hard drive of his laptop. While that case never reached the Supreme Court, it differed from the Fricosu matter because U.S. border agents already knew there was child porn on the computer because they saw it while the computer was running during a 2006 routine stop along the Canadian border. The judge in the Colorado case said there was plenty of evidence â€” a jailhouse recording of the defendant â€” that the laptop might contain information the authorities were seeking. The judge ordered Fricosu to surrender an unencrypted hard drive by February 21. The judge added that the government is precluded ""from using Ms. Fricosu's act of production of the unencrypted hard drive against her in any prosecution.""

"(CNN) -- Britain says it has suspended the government of the Turks and Caicos Islands and imposed direct rule after allegations of systemic corruption and ""serious dishonesty"". Former Turks and Caicos Islands Premier Michael Misick, shown here with his wife, LisaRaye, could be investigated. British Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant said he instructed the British governor of the island territory to suspend the ministerial government and the House of Assembly for as long as two years. Bryant said his order also suspends the constitutional right to trial by jury in the Turks and Caicos. ""This is a serious constitutional step which the UK government has not taken lightly, but these measures are essential in order to restore good governance and sound financial management,"" Bryant said in a statement. ""It remains our intentions that elections should be held by July 2011, if not sooner. It is also important that the people of Turks and Caicos Islands continue to have a voice in the interim and the order puts in place an advisory council and consultative forum to make sure this happens."" The move follows allegations of corruption in the Turks and Caicos, a British Overseas Territory of eight major islands and numerous uninhabited keys, 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of Miami, Florida. The British government set up a commission of inquiry in July 2008 to look into possible corruption or other serious dishonesty in recent years of past and present elected members of the legislature. The commission's report, delivered May 31, found ""information in abundance pointing to a high probability of systemic corruption and/or serious dishonesty"" in the Turks and Caicos, the Foreign Office said. ""This, together with clear signs of political amorality and immaturity and of general administrative incompetence, demonstrated a need for urgent suspension in whole or in part of the constitution and for other legislative and administrative reforms,"" the Foreign Office said. The report also recommends criminal investigations into former Premier Michael Misick and four of his former Cabinet ministers. ""This is not a 'British takeover,'"" said Gordon Wetherell, governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands. ""Public services will continue to be run by people of the Turks and Caicos Islands, as indeed they should be. But I hope we can now begin to run them better."" Queen Elizabeth is the head of state of the British territory, and the governor is her official representative. The governor is responsible for defense; external affairs; internal security, including the islands' police force; and the appointment of some public officials, but he is normally required to act on the advice of the Cabinet. The islands' ministerial system includes the premier and six other ministers who must act according to Cabinet policies.","Britain says it has suspended the government of the Turks and Caicos .

And the fact that the 25-year-old soundtrack still gets motors running wasn't the only surprise finding of a recent study, ""Science Behind The Song."" The study was commissioned by digital music service Spotify to examine the relationship between music, romance and seduction. ""Dirty Dancing"" was the top pick for both men and women, although the study's author, music psychologist Daniel Mullensiefen, also pointed out that men are more willing to adjust their tastes in music in order to ensure ""greater success in the bedroom."" Well played, gentlemen. Another surprise finding? Respondents said music playing in the background is 40% more likely to turn them on than the touch or feel of their partner. Rather not listen to ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"" during sex? Marvin Gaye's ""Sexual Healing"" placed second on the list, with Ravel's ""Bolero"" finishing third. ""It's no surprise that so many respondents claimed to find music arousing in the bedroom,"" Mullensiefen said in a release. He said music activates the same pleasure centers of the brain that respond to rewards such as food, drugs or sex. One in three participants identified Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" as a song that is ""better than sex."" Next on the list was ""Sex on Fire"" by Kings of Leon and ""Angels"" by Robbie Williams. Mullensiefen describes these as songs that take unexpected turns that we respond to in highly emotional, but positive, ways. The study interviewed 2,000 people in the United Kingdom between the ages of 18 and 91, with an almost equal gender split. Mullensiefen is co-director of the Master Program in Music, Mind and Brain and senior lecturer in the department of psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London. He said even though some UK pop hits were favorites coming out of the study, he believes many results would also hold true in the United States.Mullensiefen said the best tracks for getting in the mood all possess similar vocal qualities, like a wide, dynamic range, more use of the ""high chest voice"" and raspiness.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-il tapped his son to join the powerful National Defense Commission -- a move analysts say makes the latter the heir apparent, South Korean state media said. Kim Jong-il has appointed his youngest son and his brother-in-law to the National Defense Commission. ""Kim Jong-un had been appointed to a low-level post, called 'instructor' at the National Defense Commission days before the first session of the 12th Supreme People's Assembly meeting was held,"" South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported, quoting a source. CNN was not able to independently confirm the report. The secretive North Korea shields its internal affairs from international scrutiny. And often, the only news coming the Communist nation is reported by its neighbor South Korea. The two countries have technically remained in a state of war since the Korean War ended in 1953, although relations have warmed somewhat in the last few years. The Korean conflict ended in a truce, but no formal peace treaty was ever signed. The 25-year-old picked for the North Korean defense commission is the youngest of Kim's three sons, Yonhap said. The move comes two weeks after Kim added his brother-in-law Jang Song Thaek to the military board. Analysts said Jang will serve as a caretaker for the successor, Yonhap said. Jang, who has been married to Kim's sister since 1972, is considered his right-hand man, according to Yonhap. Kim was reappointed this month as chairman of the military board in his first major public appearance since a reported stroke in August. His recent health problems and long absence from public functions prompted speculation on whether he was ready to groom an heir to the world's only communist dynasty.","North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il's son joins National Defense Commission .

"In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. CNN's Christiane Amanpour gives a rare glimpse of the secret society in the ""Notes from Korea"" airing Saturday and Sunday, 8 and 11 p.m. ET. Pyongyang subway stations feature giant murals, intricate chandeliers and can also serve as bomb shelters. PYONGYANG, North Korea (CNN) -- For most journalists, traveling into North Korea is like the holy grail of assignments. Not because it's a particularly glamorous destination with beautiful beaches, delicious food or artistic masterpieces, but because it is so mysterious -- literally and figuratively closed off to the real world. It is so isolated, it's called the ""hermit kingdom."" As with many countries, you have to get a visa to enter as a journalist, but North Korea seldom grants them. I had one nine years ago, but at the last minute, I was redirected by breaking news and couldn't use it. I was really torn, because on the one hand I had to cover the Rambouillet talks that preceded the 1999 Kosovo War, but on the other hand I so wanted that rare glimpse of the Secret State. So when CNN asked me to cover the historic trip of the New York Philharmonic to Pyongyang at the end of February, I jumped at the chance. After months of negotiations, the North Korean government agreed to the orchestra's demands for playing Pyongyang, which happily for us included bringing in a large contingent of journalists. I was under no illusion that we journalists would have free run of the place -- far from it. However, any access is better than none, and any time is better than never, even in the dead of freezing North Korean winter.  Behind-the-Scenes photos from inside North Korea » . As it turned out, the concert would be happening precisely at the time the U.S. administration was trying to finally denuclearize North Korea. The two countries are still technically in a state of war, because the end of the Korean War came with an armistice, not a full peace treaty. I wanted to meet the people, see the city and learn what it's like to live in a country where you have no Internet, no freedom of travel and no freedom of expression. North Koreans are essentially cut off from the rest of the world. The country is a police state, requiring fierce patriotism and loyalty to the leader, the notoriously reclusive leader Kim Jong Il. He took over for his father, Kim Il Sung, when he died in 1994. You start getting a flavor of the cult of personality even as you fly into Pyongyang from Beijing, China, aboard Air Koryo. The plane is a relic built by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and the music onboard is patriotic. We are informed over the speaker about our glass of water, ""This drink is associated with the kind heart of the Great Leader Kim Jong Il."" There's an English-language version of the Pyongyang Times, headlined ""DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] shines under the leadership of brilliant commander."" As we fly over various landmarks, we get a history lesson, as in, ""Now our plane is crossing the Anok River, the border between China and the DPRK where our Great Leader crossed 80 years ago."" Upon touchdown, I am greeted by my minders. Minders are English-speaking North Korean Foreign Ministry officials tasked with making sure we film what is sanctioned. They greeted me warmly and said nice things about knowing my reports from CNN (which government officials do have access to). ""Oh, I guess there's no sneaking around for me,"" I laughed. They didn't. The government decides where even their own citizens can travel; papers are required and strict guidelines must be followed.  Most music forbidden in North Korea » . Our minders fit us with an armband: ""Reporter"" it says, implying ""beware."" But we do get to wander around a bit. Into the show-stopping Pyongyang underground Metro, fitted with chandeliers and covered with pastel murals. Two girls waiting for their subway train were reading the American classic ""Gone with the Wind."" I was thrilled by this little bit of cultural appreciation, until I remembered the story is actually about that shameful period of slavery. And sure enough, the girls, meeting Americans for the first time, quickly stop smiling when I ask if they're enjoying the encounter. ""Americans are our enemy,"" they said. ""If they were to abandon their hostile positions on our country I'd be more welcoming."" It's in fact an eerily similar theme we hear from everyone we stop and talk to. The people want to be friendly and hospitable but they have been taught that their misery, the Korean War, the division of the Korean Peninsula and their families, is all the fault of the United States of America. And today, U.S.-imposed sanctions and being placed on America's list of states that sponsor terrorism are considered hostile acts by North Koreans. They do not seem to understand that the United States and nations in their own region feel threatened by North Korea's nuclear program, which has in the past produced enough plutonium to build several nuclear weapons. So, into this Cold War era standoff steps for the very first time a distinguished group of American musicians, bringing the people of North Korea the most beautiful message of friendship. Their government has decided it wants this particular American message now and so it has pulled out all the stops. The orchestra asked for people around the country, not just the invited guests, to be able to listen, too. So, the government agreed to unprecedented live TV and radio broadcasts of the concert. They built the sound stage to the philharmonic's specifications and agreed to its playlist. This energy-starved nation rolled out the red carpet for their American guests by switching on the streetlights and lighting monuments along the route from the concert hall to the hotel where the orchestra was staying. At the hotel, they blasted the heat to stave off the frigid Pyongyang winter and put on banquets fit for several kings, despite the country's acute food shortage. This is the story of human warmth across a political divide, frozen in time and made bitter by history. As current U.S. nuclear negotiator Ambassador Christopher Hill told me, ""The North Koreans don't like our words, let's see if they like our music."" Former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, also a former negotiator with North Korea, told me this was a magic moment, with different peoples speaking the same language of music. He said it could push the negotiations over the top. He meant that the framework of an eventual nuclear agreement between the United States and North Korea is established, but that mutual distrust and fear can only be overcome by people-to-people diplomacy. After the concert, I was called to the foreign ministry in Pyongyang for an exclusive meeting with North Korea's nuclear negotiator, Ambassador Kim Kye Gwan. He was as effusive as Perry had been. As for the Philharmonic playing the U.S. and North Korean national anthems at the outset, he said allowing that was an act of ""political courage"" by both countries. As I left Pyongyang, I thought hard about the phenomenon known as ""ping-pong diplomacy."" This was when a sports match ushered in full diplomatic ties between the United States and Communist China in 1972. Today ""Nixon goes to China"" is a political truism that basically means ""anything is possible"" between nations. The New York Philharmonic treated its North Korean audience to a George Gershwin Classic, ""An American in Paris."" Would there one day be ""Americans in Pyongyang,"" as conductor Lorin Mazel suggested from the stage?","North Korea assignment is ""holy grail"" because country is closed off to real world .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two top North Korean diplomats were traveling to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to hold talks with Gov. Bill Richardson, the governor's spokesman said. Kim Myong Gil is a senior diplomat with the North Korean mission to the United Nations. Kim Myong Gil and Taek Jong Ho, senior diplomats with the North Korean mission to the United Nations, left New York on Tuesday and are scheduled for a two-day meeting with Richardson, said a U.S. source with knowledge of the visit and a senior State Department official. Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has traveled to North Korea several times in the past, most recently in April 2007 to secure the return of remains of U.S. soldiers killed during the Korean War. The U.S. source with knowledge of the visit said that the North Koreans had asked Richardson for the meeting. Richardson would listen to what the North Koreans had to say but would not do any negotiating, the source said. The three will meet at the governor's mansion in Santa Fe for all-day talks Wednesday and then discuss renewable energy initiatives on Thursday, according to Richardson spokesman Gilbert Gallegos. New Mexico is a leader in the United States in exploring renewable energy technologies. The visit comes on the heels of former President Bill Clinton's trip to North Korea to gain the release of two U.S. journalists held in Pyongyang. Obama administration officials had said they hoped the release of Laura Ling and Euna Lee would give North Korea a face-saving opportunity to return to talks aimed at ending its nuclear program. North Korea has said it would not return to the so-called six-party talks with the U.S., South Korea, Japan, Russia and China. The New Mexico trip could signal that the North Korean regime was ready to re-engage with the international community, the source said. ""The timing is interesting,"" said the U.S. source. ""It's two days. Interesting things can always be said. And any interesting thing can be passed on to the (Obama) administration."" Because of existing sanctions on Pyongyang, North Korean diplomats serving at the mission to the United Nations are limited to travel within a 20-mile radius outside the New York city limits. The North Koreans had asked for permission to travel to New Mexico, and the State Department granted it, a senior State Department official told CNN. ""The North Koreans asked for permission to travel and as in the past, we have said yes,"" the official said. ""But we don't know what they want to talk to Bill Richardson about. If the North Koreans want to talk, they know who to talk to. They can come back to the six-party process and tell us if they are ready to move toward denuclearization."" CNN's Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","Source: Richardson would be listening but not negotiating .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- As the chairwoman of South Korea's Hyundai group, Hyun Jeong-eun, faces business challenges few other executives can imagine. The former housewife took over the company in 2003 after the death of her husband, who faced allegations he transferred millions to North Korea to help arrange the historic 2000 summit. In addition to managing massive operations in finance, manufacturing, and transport, she oversees operations in the secretive state of North Korea. Subsidiary Hyundai Asan has led efforts to build economic ties between the North and South, so Hyun is not only managing a multinational through a recession but also through global tensions over the North's nuclear program. Hyundai Asan has invested $272 million in North Korea, in projects like the Kaesong Industrial Park and tours to Mount Kumgang. Hyun traveled to North Korea in August to secure the release of a Hyundai worker who was detained on accusations he insulted the government. While there, she spent more than four hours with the state's reclusive leader - Kim Jong Il -- who was said to be recovering from a possible stroke. As part of CNN's Eye on South Korea, Kristie Lu Stout sat down with Hyun at Hyundai Group's Headquarters in Seoul. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. CNN: What was your impression of Kim Jong Il as a man? Does he look healthy? Was he mentally very aware? Hyun: When I first saw him I thought he had lost a lot of weight than before, but once we started talking, his voice was strong and he talked a lot about things that had happened in the past. He talked about my father-in-law [Hyundai Founder Chung Ju-Yung], my husband and a lot of things from the past, and it seemed like he still had a good memory and had no issues with carrying out his work. He seemed to be in good health. When you were talking with Kim Jong Il, was it your impression that he wants more investment from South Korea? That he wants to do more business with your country? He showed a lot of enthusiasm. He said he hopes the North and South Korean government can talk things through so to have a lot of South Korean companies enter the North, and he also said that since they have the natural resources and the South has the skills to sell, if both sides work together he expects the North and South to prosper. Is Kim Jong Il a tough business negotiator? He seems to be very honest and straightforward when he speaks. So I believe that if direct talks with the leader Kim Jong Il are possible, a lot of good results will come out of it. I personally think that if President Obama and Kim Jong Il meet, things can be worked out quite easily. The Kaesong industrial complex, the joint facility run by North and South, what is the future of that complex? Currently we are only operating the first block, but I am sure that once things get settled down by both governments, we have many plans for the second block as well. A hotel needs to be built. We need to have hospitals, post offices, so I am expecting gradually that we will expand business there. Kaesong Industrial complex has North Korean workers. What is it like to manage them? Do they have the skills? Do they understand the technology? North Korean employees work very hard, and I heard that women work especially hard, so all the factories want to take in the female workers. In the beginning, because the workers hadn't used things like sewing machines before, I heard they would come to work an hour early to practice and that they work with great enthusiasm and work very hard. North Korean workers are also good at holding small meetings and they talk things through during those meetings. So the factory owners seem to be very pleased with it all. When you have a factory in China, if there's a problem it's hard to fix it because of the language, but in this case, since you can communicate freely, the employers find it much easier to do things. Why invest so much in North Korea? What is the upside for Hyundai Group? It all started with the project of my father-in-law. Because he was born in North Korea he always had a great love towards North Korea. He met some of his relatives there. I think personally, he was saddened by the economic poverty that people were experiencing in that country. So this isn't a business mission, it is a personal mission? I think for my father-in-law, a lot of it was started for personal reasons. For me, of course I do it for business, but also because my husband experienced bad things due to operations in North Korea, I feel like it's my duty to continue this business to ensure his death does not go to waste. Is the South Korean government supportive of Hyundai groups operations and interests in North Korea? Not really at the moment because of the nuclear issue at the middle. Things are not going that smoothly at the moment. But we are hoping in the future that they will help and cooperate and be supportive and I guess they will.","Met with North Korean leader for four hours in August to release an employee .

"(CNN) -- Step into any major urban center across Africa and you'll have no problem accessing your favorite websites, catching the latest news online or sending your friends an e-mail. Step outside the city, however, and you'll soon have to say goodbye to the world (wide web). Read this: Africa's new skyscraper cities . Take for example Limpopo, a rural province in the northern part of South Africa, one of the country's poorest regions. ""There is just no connectivity whatsoever,"" says Mahlo Mokgalong, a professor at the University of Limpopo, located outside the city of Polokwane. ""From the area where I am,"" explains Mokgalong, ""the nearest Internet cafÃ© will be 30 kilometers (away) -- there are even some people who travel 50 kilometers or so to get to the nearest Internet facility."" But all this could soon change. Limpopo has been selected by Microsoft for the latest trial of an initiative using white spaces technology -- the unused channels in the broadcast TV spectrum -- aiming to bring broadband with speeds of up to 2 Mb per second to under-served rural communities. The 12-month pilot project, which will become operational in October, will use the relatively new technology and solar-powered base stations to get five secondary schools in the province online -- all located within 10 kilometers of the university, which is used as the project's hub. Mokgalong says the pilot will benefit both pupils and teachers. ""Their lives are going to be made easier,"" he says. ""Some of the schools in the area have a shortage in terms of materials,"" adds the professor. ""So it will definitely benefit the learners in those schools and expose them to computer usage."" Unused spectrum . But what is this experimental technology and how does it work? Put simply, TV white spaces refers to the unused frequencies that are lying idle following the migration of TV broadcast from analogue to digital -- previously, these were kept clear to avoid interference with neighboring channels. The low-signal frequencies, from around 400 megahertz to about 800 megahertz, can penetrate walls and other obstacles more easily than the traditional broadband technologies. They can also transfer data traveling longer distances before they need to be reboosted, up to 10 kilometers, which means that fewer towers or base stations are needed to cover a wider area. Read this: Can Africa unlock its solar potential? All potential users need is a device with Wi-Fi capability, such as a mobile phone, a PC or a tablet, that will connect to a Wi-Fi access point that, in turn, is connected to a white space base station. Why Africa . Microsoft, which has been researching TV white spaces for 12 years, has so far deployed the technology in a number of locations -- from the United States and Europe to emerging markets in Southeast Asia. But it's Africa, a continent beset by connectivity and infrastructure challenges, where the company sees the biggest potential. The tech giant first brought white spaces to Africa last February when it launched a trial delivering broadband access to remote villages in Kenya's Rift valley. This was followed by a second pilot in an urban environment in May, bringing wireless broadband access to students at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, before the launch of the third trial in South Africa. Read this: Teen plans 'hacker school' in Kenya . Fernando de Sousa, general manager of Microsoft's Africa initiatives, says the continent is an ideal location for the deployment of white spaces. He cites a number of reasons. ""The first one is the distance; the ability to cover ground with the least amount of effort,"" says de Sousa. ""Think about it, with one tower, with one broadcast station, if you go 10 kilometers either direction you're creating ... a very big patch of land which we're essentially covering with one antenna."" This brings infrastructure costs significantly down, says de Sousa, something that is key in the efforts to speed up Internet adoption in Africa and help its economic development. ""We need to do an innovative approach to get people online,"" he says. ""We cannot follow traditional methods where perhaps the coverage increases by 1,000 yards every week or so -- we have to go much faster than that ... because of the very rapid growth of Africa's workforce and the desperate need to get skills into the population."" Putting the technology to test . Microsoft is not the only company rolling out white spaces projects in Africa. In late March, Google launched a similar pilot project bringing wireless broadband to 10 schools in Cape Town, South Africa. Read this: Why tech innovators are Africa's future . Microsoft says it plans to use its pilots, part of its 4Afrika Initiative, to convince governments to make the needed legal and regulatory changes that would allow for the deployment of the technology across the continent. But getting the many regulatory bodies on board could be a significant challenge for a wider roll out. Consultations over white space schemes in other countries have raised concerns that the technology could interfere with television broadcasts or services using similar frequencies, but Microsoft believes that will not be a problem. ""We've arrived at a point where we've not only improved the technology but also proved that there is no interference as television users continue to see and have the quality they desire,"" says de Sousa. ""We're also able to deliver what is a hugely valuable service because in Africa (lack of access) is probably the single biggest constraint to economic development, skills acquisition and jobs creation."" Excitement . Mark Graham is director of research at the University of Oxford's Internet Institute. While he welcomes the initiative to provide rural African schools with Internet access, he cautions that many schools have other needs. ""It's great that they're experimenting and trying this but other things need to be taken into account,"" he says. ""For example, some schools might not have electricity, toilets, teachers, textbooks. Connecting people is a prerequisite for some of the things you might want to happen -- but the problem is when people think that's enough."" De Sousa says Microsoft is now in discussions with governments, multilateral organizations and local service providers about rolling out white spaces in about 10 African countries. ""We're now getting into the stage where the pilot stages are over and we're starting to deploy commercially viable deployments,"" he says. Back in Limpopo, Mokgalong says the schools can't wait for the project to begin. ""There is excitement, everyone is eagerly waiting to see how this is going to happen,"" he says. ""If the pilot works then I'm sure we will increase (the number of schools),"" adds Mokgalong. ""We're looking at education for a start and I think later health will follow, business will follow -- everyone is looking to participate in in this.""","Microsoft trialing TV 'white spaces' to bring broadband to rural Africa .

"(CNN) -- Same-sex couples must be permitted to marry in New Jersey, a state judge ruled Friday, arguing that the parallel label ""civil unions,"" which the state already allows gay couples, is illegally preventing them from getting federal benefits. The judge ordered that same-sex marriages be allowed starting October 21. But the date could be delayed on appeal, and the office of Gov. Chris Christie indicated the case would be appealed to the New Jersey Supreme Court. The ruling cites the U.S. Supreme Court's June rejection of part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a move that ensured same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. Read Friday's ruling . After the DOMA ruling, some federal agencies are extending benefits to legally married same-sex couples, but denying them to same-sex couples in ""civil unions,"" Judge Mary Jacobson of Mercer County Superior Court wrote in her ruling Friday. ""If the trend of federal agencies deeming civil union partners ineligible for benefits continues, plaintiffs will suffer even more, while their opposite-sex New Jersey counterparts continue to receive federal marital benefits for no reason other than the label placed upon their relationship by the state,"" Jacobson wrote. ""This unequal treatment requires that New Jersey extend civil marriage to same-sex couples to satisfy the equal protection guarantees of the New Jersey Constitution,"" she continued. Jacobson ruled on a lawsuit that six same-sex couples and their children, as well as gay-rights group Garden State Equality, filed against the state. The group's executive director, Troy Stevenson, said the ruling is ""amazing news."" ""It's an amazingly strong decision. We're very excited,"" Stevenson said Friday. ""We've been saying for months that we were going to win marriage equality for New Jersey, and this was a total victory."" An attorney who represented the plaintiffs also hailed the ""thrilling"" ruling. ""We argued that limiting lesbians and gay men to civil union is unfair and unconstitutional, and now the court has agreed,"" said Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights organization. New Jersey has recognized civil unions between same-sex couples since 2007, after the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the state must allow same-sex couples all the rights and benefits of marriage. As far as state rights and benefits went, civil unions and marriages differed only in label, Jacobson noted. Friday's ruling came more than a year after Christie vetoed a bill that would have legalized same-sex marriage in the state. On Friday afternoon, Christie's office said it had wanted the ""issue of marriage equality"" to be on the ballot this November, but said the Legislature scuttled the effort. It also indicated that Jacobson's ruling would be appealed. ""Since the Legislature refused to allow the people to decide expeditiously, we will let the Supreme Court make this constitutional determination,"" read a Friday statement from Christie's office, which later clarified that it meant the state's high court. The New Jersey attorney general's office, which was one of the suit's defendants, deferred CNN's questions about Friday's ruling to the governor's office. New Jersey is one of four states that offer civil unions, but not marriage, to same-sex couples. The others are Colorado, Hawaii and Illinois. Same-sex marriage is legal in 13 U.S states and the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. Same-sex marriage is banned in every state not mentioned above, except for New Mexico, which has no laws banning or allowing it. Pennsylvania judge orders clerk to obey same-sex marriage ban .

"(CNN) -- There's a hot new travel site -- but it doesn't really arrange any travel. The Internet blew up Wednesday over Misstravel.com, a site that launched April 9. According to its founder, Brandon Wade, the site connects rich people with good-looking people who want to gallivant around the world on the rich person's dime. ""We are a meeting space like a nightclub or a bar for people who are interested in talking,"" Wade said. ""This isn't an escort service."" Wade points out the ""Escorts are not welcome"" disclaimer linked from the home page. Visitors to Misstravel.com may miss that message initially when confronted immediately upon arrival by the image taking up most of the home page, a young woman sitting school-girlishly (short skirt, head tilted) on a pink suitcase. A video play button appears over her. Click and hear a woman's voice speaking sexily as a female cartoon delivers the pitch. ""Are you attractive but you don't have the money to travel?"" she asks. ""What if you could travel around the world, stay in five-star resorts, dine at top-rated restaurants and do the fun things travelers do, all for free?"" On Misstravel, you can, the voice says. Male cartoons of doctors, lawyers, bankers, athletes and such pop into the frame, and the voice says, ""Best of all, they have the money, and they are willing to spend it on you."" No one on the site has gone on any trips that Wade knows about -- mostly because the site is so new -- and Misstravel does not arrange travel, he said. Like a dating site, Misstravel only provides a platform for people to create profiles and communicate. There are two categories on Misstravel: ""attractive"" and ""generous."" Judging from photos of the attractives, they evidently have so little money they can't afford many clothes. The site offers no promises that a generous will not stick an attractive with any bills. It's up to the two of them to negotiate, Wade said. The generouses include ""YoungCEO4U"" who claims to be 27, worth between $500,000 and $1 million and from Farmington, Michigan. He is interested in ""no strings attached"" and going to the Dominican Republic. An attractive could also choose a 6 foot 2 inch generous named ""Bigmoolah"" from Florida or ""Texan323,"" who lists himself as single but is open, he indicates, to ""Mutually Beneficial Arrangements (Sugar Daddy / Sugar Baby)"" and ""Married Dating/Discreet Affair."" If you register as an attractive, you pay nothing. If you're generous, you pay a minimum of $50 to be able to communicate with 10 attractives, Wade said. For $250, you can communicate with up to 100 attractives. Wade said the site allows people of all types; although it's called Misstravel, men and women, gay and straight are welcome to be either an attractive or a generous. When these categories connect, Wade said, they should consult the safety guidelines Misstravel provides, such as, ""Never travel out of the country or to a different city to meet someone you do not know well."" Something to keep in mind when dealing with ""Manimal"" a 30-year-old from the Chicago area who asks in his profile, ""Are you woman enough?"" Wade said he was a ""nerd growing up in Singapore"" who didn't have a girlfriend or a kiss until he was 21. His site is intended, he said, to help people who are shy like him connect. He is trying to follow some wisdom his mother shared with him years ago. ""A little bit of generosity,"" he said, ""goes a long way when it comes to dating."" What do you think?

"(CNN) -- Nickolas Ashford, one-half of the successful Motown singer-songwriter duo of Ashford and Simpson, died Monday afternoon, his longtime former publicist said. Liz Rosenberg, who in addition to having been their publicist described herself as a close friend of Ashford and his wife Valerie Simpson, said she was ""heartbroken"" to hear of Ashford's death. ""He was a true king,"" she said. ""I loved him very much."" Ashford had been battling and was being treated for throat cancer, and Rosenberg said she believed his death ""was quite sudden."" His wife and children were at his bedside when he died, she said. He was 69, reported imdb.com and numerous other sources. According to their MySpace page, Ashford and Simpson met in 1964 in New York City. Within two years, as songwriters with Scepter Songwriters, they scored their first hit with Ray Charles' ""Let's Go Get Stoned."" The couple then joined Motown Records, where they wrote a host of popular songs for the likes of Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terrell and Diana Ross including ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"" ""Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing"" and ""Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)."" Later in their careers, their songwriting credits included Chaka Khan's ""I'm Every Woman."" In the '70s, Ashford and Simpson went from songwriters to performers, releasing nine albums for Motown, Warner Brothers Records (like CNN, a division of Time Warner) and Capitol Records between 1973 and 1984. Their biggest hit during that time was the song ""Solid (As a Rock)."" On stage, Ashford typically sported long curly hair, a goatee and a knack for hitting high notes. In 1996, he established the Sugar Bar, a restaurant and live entertainment venue in Manhattan's Upper West Side. According to its website, the bar showcases soul, jazz, Caribbean, African and other types of music and has been visited by numerous guests over the years such as Bruce Willis, Stevie Wonder, Maya Angelou and others.

"Washington (CNN) -- Russian bomber aircraft were spotted last week off Alaska and then within 50 miles of California, military officials said. Four long-range planes flew close to Alaska on June 4 where they were intercepted by U.S. F-22 fighter jets. Two peeled off and headed west, while the other two flew south and were identified by American F-15 fighters within 50 miles of the California coast. Details were confirmed to CNN on Thursday by the Defense Department and the North American Aerospace Defense Command, a joint U.S.-Canadian force. The United States believes the Russians were on a training mission, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said. The planes, which included Tu-95 Bear-H bombers and refueling aircraft, never breached U.S. air space, Capt. Jeff Davis, a NORAD spokesman, said. But they did enter the U.S. Air Defense Identification Zone, which is an area extending 200 miles from the North American coast and is mainly within international airspace. Commercial and other planes must identify themselves when they fly through that zone. ""They followed all the protocols and it was a very professional encounter on both sides,"" Davis said. ""There was nothing that they were doing that was contrary to international law.""

"Paris (CNN) -- In the tunnels and caves that lie deep beneath Paris an elaborate, and, at times, dangerous game of cat and mouse is played out nearly every weekend. In this case the mice are represented by the cataphiles -- a group of dedicated hedonists who love to party in the abandoned quarries deep beneath the French capital - and the part of the cat is played by the police who patrol the places most people would fear to tread. Paris has two main underground attractions -- one being a vast catacomb which holds the remains of more than six million people, the other being a network of tunnels and quarries that stretch nearly 321 kilometres under the city. At the official catacombs visitors who are prepared to walk down the 139 steps and along endless tunnels are met by truly extraordinary sights as well as a fascinating slice of 18th-century life in Paris. In 1786 the cemeteries of Paris were full to bursting, meaning corpses were often buried near those people still living. After the collapse of a communal grave near the center of the city it was decided to transfer all the bones to one vast ossuary. Nowadays the mountains of unwanted bones have been arranged into a macabre set of alleys and pillars - a process that was started two centuries ago. One of the museum's curators Tram Nguyen told us how people usually reacted on their first visit: ""When you come here for the first time you get quite destabilized but then you get used to it. There are so many bones here you don't see them as human remains, you just see them as decorations."" Our program was looking as all aspects of underground life in Paris and in the process of researching it we also came across another extraordinary group who put the subterranean spaces to new uses. Urban Experiment, UX for short, is a highly secretive organization which has gained a cult following after successfully completing a series of high profile stunts deep under the city. Members of UX very rarely reveal what, how, or why they do what they do but CNN arranged a series of meetings with one of their members who slowly let us into some of the secrets. We first met Lazar Kunstmann - not his real name but the one he insists on using -- in an anonymous Parisian bar. With a shaved head and regulation black clothes he is a friendly, if somewhat cagey, individual. We wanted to know who the UX were. His answer was suitably cryptic. ""The UX is a collective of people who pursue the same aim with a range of skills. It is anyone and everyone. There are no characteristics in terms of age, sex, social or cultural background -- the only characteristic is to live relatively close to the area where the projects are carried out, in Paris. All the rules of the UX have to do with feasibility -- the practical aspect of the execution of the projects."" The Palais de Chaillot - or more precisely one of quarries that lies beneath it -- was the scene of one their most infamous projects. The group - which has existed for 30 years -- dug deep under the theatre to create their own fully functioning cinema in one of the hundreds of caves under the city. They even made their own film to mark the event. Over a beer Kunstmann explains what motivates the UX. ""We are a group who use public spaces, not necessarily the public spaces underground, not necessarily abandoned. It is simple - the only characteristic of the spaces we use is that they are public, and have been left, that's to say ""loosely"" abandoned. The vocation of these spaces is to accommodate projects."" Secrecy is, of course, essential for Kunstmann and other members of the UX. ""The secrecy is just linked to the feasibility. When we were young we profited from the craze of underground parties in the 1990s in the ancient quarries of the Latin Quarter in order to discover, that in fact there was all this public space, which was totally abandoned, which we could use for anything. Much later, at the same time as wanting to learn more about all this public space, to have a geographic and practical knowledge - that is by getting hold of maps and keys to use the tunnels - we realized this really was the ideal location for numerous projects."" Before we leave him Kunstmann tells us that the UX have several more projects in mind but, unsurprisingly perhaps, he declines to elaborate saying future plans have to be kept under wraps.

"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- He ventures into the forest looking for his daughters, armed with bow and arrow in case the terrorists surprise him. The odds are stacked against him. No one has found the 276 girls abducted from their school last month by the terror group Boko Haram. But then again, no one's really been looking, the father says. That night of horror . The father's voice shakes as he recalls the night his two daughters were snatched from their dormitory at an all-girls school in Nigeria. It began with an explosion so loud that it shook buildings in the northern village of Chibok, waking the girls' family. That was quickly followed by the sound of gunfire echoing into the dark night. By the time father made it to the Government Girls Secondary School, the militants had already opened fire on security guards and set buildings on fire. Unarmed, there was nothing the father could do but watch ... and wait. ""When I went into the school compound, nobody will ever stand it,"" said the father, who is not being identified for fear of reprisals from attackers or the government. ""You will see their dresses cut out all over. And the hostel and dormitory, everything was bombed into ashes. So this man told us they have gone with our daughters. We couldn't believe him."" Armed members of Boko Haram attacked the school on April 14, overpowering the guards and herding the girls onto waiting trucks, according to accounts of that night. The trucks disappeared with the girls into the dense forest bordering Cameroon, a stronghold for the terror group whose name translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. That's where the story gets hazy. Mixed messages from the government . There are questions about just how many girls were taken, with varying reports putting that number between 230 to 276, depending on who is talking. In the days after the attack, the military said all the girls had been released or rescued. But after the girls' families began asking where their daughters were, the military retracted the statement. This much the father knows for sure: His two daughters are among those still in captivity after almost a month. Nigerian officials have defended their response and said they are searching. ""We've done a lot -- but we are not talking about it,"" presidential spokesman Doyin Okupe said. ""We're not Americans. We're not showing people, you know, but it does not mean that we are not doing something."" But the father scoffed at the government's response. ""We have never seen any military man there,"" he said. ""Had it been military men who went into the bush to rescue our daughters, we would have seen them."" 'We can't let this be the new normal' Terrorists fill the void . Boko Haram, on the other hand, is entrenched in the region. The father believes that either supporters or members of Boko Haram live in his village. They know his family, the father says. They know about his daughters. The family is so afraid, he says, that they have fled their home and taken to sleeping in the bush. ""Life is very dangerous in Chibok right now. Since on 14th of April, to date, we don't sleep at home,"" the father said. They're not alone. The father said that starting around 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening, ""people will disappear into the bush because there is no security."" ""We sleep in the bush with all of our little ones,"" he said. A violent force, a mother's plea . Boko Haram is a ruthless, powerful force. The group says its goal is to impose stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Under its version of Sharia law, women should be at home raising children and looking after their husbands, not at school learning to read and write. A video that surfaced this week showed a man claiming to be the group's leader saying he will sell the hundreds kidnapped girls. ""I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah,"" said a man claiming to be Abubakar Shekau. ""There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women. I sell women."" The mother of the two girls had little response, just tears. ""Most of the women, we mothers, we started crying because had no one to help us,"" she said. ""Our daughters (have) been adopted or captured as slaves. Now ... we cannot even eat."" This isn't the parents' first experience with Boko Haram. They adopted one of their two daughters after her parents were killed by the terrorist group. The mother begs for the girls' freedom, away from a lifetime of abuse and slavery. ""They don't know, probably one of them are born a president or doctor or pastor or a lawyer who will be helpful to the country,"" she said. ""Why would they molest these little ones? Please ... release them."" Vladimir Duthiers reported from Abuja, Nigeria; Holly Yan and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Khushbu Shah also contributed to this report.","A father says despite officials' claims, he has seen no military presence .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- North Korea, formally called the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is also known as the Hermit Kingdom for a good reason. Chinese border guards patrol in Jilin province across from the North Korean border on March 21, 2009. For decades, it has been shrouded by a veil of secrecy that has prevented us from better understanding this important nation. As journalists we seek out the realities of life there, beyond the myths and hype, but that is difficult because the DPRK is generally inaccessible to journalists. The gap between reality and illusion remains profound. Journalists, such as the two Americans being detained in North Korea, do travel to the border between China and North Korea to get a sense of what life is like in the isolated nation of 22 million people. The circumstances surrounding the journalists' arrest are still unclear. ""North Korea is such a difficult country to enter for a foreign reporter that the temptation to slip across the frozen river border is considerable,"" said former CNN correspondent Mike Chinoy, author of ""Meltdown: The Inside Story of the North Korean Nuclear Crisis."" ""If that's what they did, however, it was extremely foolhardy and really pushing their luck."" China and North Korea share a 1,415-kilometer (880-mile) border that mainly follows two rivers. The Yalu River defines the border on the northwest, the Tumen River on the northeast. By land, the two countries are linked by seven road crossings and four railway points. Over the years, I have visited three towns on the Chinese side of the border. From a narrow river crossing at the border town of Tumen, Koreans cross on foot and in trucks. Those going back into North Korea carry bags full of food and household wares, even bicycles. Some of those coming into China ferry logs and minerals. From across the Yalu River in China's Dandong City in October of 2006, I had a glimpse of Sinuiju, a North Korean border town of some 350,000 people. Using a long camera lens, I saw school children learn to roller skate, and residents celebrating what looked like a wedding. Still the city's decrepit appearance hinted at stagnation and isolation. It was a stark contrast from the Chinese city, which was ablaze in neon lights and a bustling commerce and trade. North Korea's public face is one of smiling children, clean streets, manicured gardens, spectacular scenery and a stoic people united under the aegis of Kim Jong Il, known among Koreans as the ""Dear Leader."" I saw it up close twice, in 1996 and 2002, when I had the chance to visit the most reclusive nation on earth. We were typically greeted by polite officials and smiling children and invited to watch spectacular performances with a cast of thousands. North Korea, however, remains isolated, diplomatically and economically, led by an erratic leadership that behaves out of fear and insecurity. Diplomatic sources in Beijing suggest that China is getting fed up with North Korea's inability to preserve social stability and with its erratic behavior in the multi-national efforts to deal with North Korea's nuclear program. Publicly, however, China sticks to the official line, often calling the two nations' ties as close as ""lips and teeth"" -- one cannot function without the other. In my two visits to North Korea, I have detected conflicting signs -- one, of social instability and another of a tentative desire to experiment with reforms. In 2002, the government tolerated some quasi-private businesses, raised civil servants' salaries and deregulated prices of some commodities. But much of these tentative efforts to change seem to have been aborted and the country remains isolated and poor. What emerges is a nation, now considered a nuclear threat, desperately seeking respect and economic aid. That picture is now intertwined with the two detained U.S. journalists, Chinoy said. ""It will be interesting to see how the case is handled. North Korea has been in a generally more bellicose mood lately,"" said Chinoy, who is currently a senior fellow at the Pacific Council on International Policy. ""The concern is that this incident could get caught up in the bigger picture of heightened tension between the north and the U.S. and the north and south. If it is not swiftly resolved, it will add to the complexity of the situation facing [U.S. President Barack] Obama, where he is under pressure from Seoul, Tokyo and some in Washington to get tough, while trying to find a way to get diplomacy with the North going again."" In recent years, waves of North Korean refugees have fled into China seeking food, jobs and freedom. In the border cities of Tumen, Yanji and Dandong, these refugees tell of misery and persecution. They live under the protection of relatives, friends and human rights activists. Here, people speak of a Korean ""underground railways"" -- a network that smuggles desperate people across the border and eventually out of China. China is struggling to keep out the hundreds of North Korean immigrants and refugees, but stopping the exodus remains a tall order. A fundamental solution, analysts suggest, lies not in China but in North Korea, where many people are running away from humanitarian disasters and political persecution.","Secretive and closed off for decades, North Korea is known as the Hermit Kingdom .

"(CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's TV reality series ended Sunday with the actress laying some very personal cards on the table. In a scene from the season finale of OWN's docuseries ""Lindsay,"" the 27-year-old explained that the reason she'd missed some filming days for the project was because she'd had a miscarriage. ""No one knows this: I had a miscarriage for those two weeks I took off,"" she said. ""It's a very long story."" During the docuseries, one of the plot points that emerged was Lohan's inconsistency with showing up for work. But as she explained on Sunday's finale episode, it was because she was unable to. ""That's why, on the show when it says, 'She doesn't want to come down,' I couldn't move; I was sick,"" Lohan said. ""Mentally, that messes with you."" OWN's ""Lindsay"" covered a lot of ground with Lohan, following the actress after she left rehab in July 2013 and moved to New York while trying to repair her career. By the time the last episode aired, Lohan -- along with the rest of the world -- had seen the difficult footage of her post-rehab life. ""I cried so many times watching it,"" she said. ""Watching this series, I just know how I felt at that moment, and I can relate to that girl. Like, 'Oh my God, this is really sad. Who's helping her?' ... There was a lot going on in my life then."" Filming the eight-part series did impart some lessons, and one in particular was how her struggle with addiction could leave her without a career. ""Even if it's not my intention to lose everything I'm now working for, that's what this addiction will do to me. It's a really f***ked-up disease, and it's really scary,"" she reflected. ""(Now) I'm in a good place, and I don't want to mess with that. It feels good, and I'm happy.

"(CNN) -- North Korea's announcement last week that it has begun reprocessing nuclear fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear facility about 60 miles (nearly 100 kilometers) north of the capitol, Pyongyang, raises questions about the secretive nation's agenda. A satellite view of the nuclear facility at Yongbyon. CNN talked to two top North Korea experts to gain insights into what North Korea may be signaling, what it is realistically capable of accomplishing, and what the developments mean for its relations with the U.S. Selig Harrison, the director of the Asia Program at the Center for International Policy, said the North Korean announcement about restarting its nuclear facilities should come as ""no surprise"" to the United States. ""The North Koreans had said that they were going to do this. The United States leadership made a mistake by going to the U.N. because the North Koreans said on March 26 that if we went to the U.N., they would resume their nuclear program,"" he said, referring to North Korea's recent decision to launch a rocket despite international opposition. Harrison visited Pyongyang in January and doesn't expect North Korea to reprocess plutonium for at least a year. Nuclearization may not even be their primary goal with this latest announcement, he said. ""You have to put it all into context of the North Korean situation, they want to negotiate to get economic help. All of this is a re-bargaining chip,"" he said. ""The North Koreans are not hell-bent on nuclear weapons, this is just their opportunity, and they want to negotiate in bilateral talks with the US."" ""The North Koreans have shut down the six-party talks, but they haven't ruled out bilateral negotiations,"" he said, referring to talks aimed at persuading North Korea to scrap its nuclear program. The talks involved China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the United States. An additional part of North Korea's re-bargaining chip may be two detained U.S. journalists, he added. North Korea has held Laura Ling and Euna Lee, reporters for Current TV, since they were taken into custody along the China-North Korea border on March 17. Last week North Korea said will try the two journalists on allegations of entering the country illegally and intending ""hostile acts."" Harrison said the North Koreans ""are hoping the United States will agree to bilateral talks in part because of the journalists they are holding, and the U.S. knows North Korea will ask something of them for the release of those journalists."" One of the main reasons North Korea broke off the six-party talks was because it hasn't received the energy and aid promised by other countries, Harrison said. ""Japan had promised energy to North Korea that they haven't yet delivered, and this is energy that North Korea desperately needs,"" Harrison said. ""In all, we have delivered about one-third percent of the amount of energy we had promised the North Korea."" But what if the North Koreans do want to weaponize? Siegfried Hecker, the co-director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, said he believes North Korea can make bombs. ""All they have to do is to extract the plutonium from the fuel rods which already exist in the cooling pool. They can now bring some of those fuel rods out and begin to take them through the reprocessing facility. It will take four to six months to reprocess all of the fuel rods. And they will be able to extract about a bomb and a half's worth of plutonium from them,"" Hecker explained. Hecker, who visited the Yongbyon facility in late February 2008, said he was quite certain the North Koreans will be able to convert the plutonium into a bomb in just a few additional months, added to the months spent reprocessing, if needed. ""Our greatest concern is that North Korea will try to use this existing plutonium to conduct another nuclear test,"" he said, referring to a 2006 effort by the North Koreans. Hecker explained that the fuel rods with the plutonium couldn't be shipped easily during the first steps of disablement of the Yongbyon plant and therefore were still intact when the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors left earlier this month. ""The idea was the pool holding the fuel rods would be kept under close IAEA inspection,"" Hecker said, ""In essence, it was a pretty good hedge for the North Koreans all along...the fuel rods and the reprocessing plant were the easiest part of the Yongbyon plant to get going again,"" he said. Hecker said restarting the reactor is a different story. Since the water cooling tower was destroyed in June 2008, Hecker said the North Koreans will likely rebuild the structure, which will take an estimated six months. He said they also need to process fresh fuel for the reactor, which will take about six months as well. ""So in six months from now, they can reload the reactor. Then the reactor would have to run for about two to three years to get another two bombs worth of plutonium,"" he said. Hecker cautions that he, too, tries to put the ""complicated"" situation in perspective. ""We have to note that we're dealing with disablement, not dismantlement. Disablement means to make more difficult and not impossible to restart,"" Hecker said. ""Our greatest concern will be if the North Koreans will use the reprocessed plutonium to do another nuclear test.""","Nuclearization may not be primary goal, Center for International Policy official says .

"(CNN) -- Italy and the Netherlands sealed their places in the World Cup finals in Brazil next year while England survived an uncomfortable night in Kiev against Ukraine in key qualifying matches Tuesday. Mario Balotelli scored the winner as Italy came from behind to beat the Czech Republic 2-1 to seal Group B, while the Dutch had a pair of Robin van Persie goals to thank for a 2-0 win in Andorra to wrap up Group D of European qualifying. Roy Hodgson's England battled to a goalless draw to maintain their leadership of Group H, one point clear of Ukraine and Montenegro with two rounds of matches remaining. It was an unconvincing performance and visiting goalkeeper Joe Hart was the busier goalkeeper in a match of few clear cut chances, but Frank Lampard, making his 100th appearance for England nearly grabbed the winner with a headed effort in injury time. Italy fell behind to a 19th minute Libor Kozak volleyed strike in Turin, but the Azzurri struck back through Giorgio Chiellini in the 51st minute before Balotelli stepped up to hit the winner past Petr Cech from the spot three minutes later to set the four-time champions on the road to Brazil. Milan's Balotelli had a mixed night, wasting several chances to put his side firmly in control, before winning the penalty as he was crudely fouled by Theodor Gebre Selassie. To complete an ultimately disappointing night for the Czechs, Daniel Kolar was given his marching orders near the end. ""We've qualified and we're really satisfied,"" said Italy coach Cesare Prandelli. ""Tonight there were spells in which we suffered physically but we also played some quality football. This squad has a lot of quality,"" he told AFP. Fellow powerhouses Germany need just a single point from their final two matches to join them after a 3-0 win in the Faroe Islands, with Per Mertesacker, Arsenal new boy Mesut Ozil and Thomas Muller scoring the goals. Sweden still have a mathematical chance of overhauling the Group C leaders after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's first minute goal in the 1-0 win in Kazakhstan, but the Germans can seal qualification next month when they play the Republic of Ireland. Switzerland are also all but assured of a finals place, five points clear of Iceland in Group E as a pair of Fabian Schar goals saw off Norway 2-0. France revived their hopes by breaking a scoring drought which had lasted 526 minutes in a fighting 4-2 win in the Belarus. Franck Ribery canceled out a Egor Filipenko opener for the hosts and then equalized for the second time after Timofei Kalachev's effort. Samir Nasri and Paul Pogba grabbed vital late goals to clinch victory for the French, who draw level with world champions Spain on points in Group I. Spain, who have played a game less, were salvaging a 2-2 draw with Chile in a friendly in Geneva, equalizing for the second time in added time through Jesus Navas. Eduardo Vargas netted twice for the South Americans, with Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado canceling out his first effort. Wales' 3-0 home defeat to Serbia in Group A was notable for the appearance of Real Madrid's new world record signing Gareth Bale, who played for half an hour as a second half substitute and almost scored with a late free kick. Bale has not played since a pre season friendly for his former side Tottenham, nursing a foot injury. Earlier, Jordan won a marathon penalty shootout 9-8 with hosts Uzbekistan to qualify for an intercontinental playoff, with the winners reaching next year's finals. They will play South America's fifth placed team after a topsy turvy contest in Tashkent. The home side went ahead through Anzur Ismailov and dominated much of the first half, only for Saeed Murjan to level with a stunning half volley strike just before the interval. Despite several chances for either side, the match went into extra time, which was delayed for 18 minutes by a floodlight failure. The penalty drama was intense until the unfortunate Ismailov failed to convert his effort to leave the visitors celebrating.","Italy and Netherlands seal spots in World Cup finals in Brazil .

"(CNN) -- I thought I was prepared for North Korea. After all, I'd spent more than half my life studying, traveling to and living in the former Soviet Union as well as other Communist and post-Communist countries. Commuters head to work in downtown Pyongyang this past February. So, as we arrived at Pyongyang airport, I felt oddly at home. The same empty airport as in Leningrad in 1969. (In the North Korean capital we later found out our flight was the only one scheduled for arrival that day.) Staring down at our plane as we taxied to the terminal, a huge color portrait of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's ""Great Leader."" No matter where we went over the next nine days, the gaze of Kim Il Sung, or his son, Kim Jong Il, the current ruler known as the ""Dear Leader,"" would follow us, from portraits hung on buildings, monuments, bridges ... to lapel pins on the chests of almost everyone we met, including the two men who greeted us, Mr. Jang and Mr. Song, who would be our guides, minders and controllers for the duration of our stay. In 1969, arriving in Russia as a student, it seemed that every street I traveled was decorated with the image of Vladimir Lenin, father of the Russian revolution. Adults wore lapel pins with images of the Bolshevik leader, children wore little ""Baby Lenin"" pins. ""Lenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin will live."" I was told, and so does Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994. Even in death, the Communist leaders have something in common: their bodies are embalmed and lie in glass-covered coffins, on display in mausoleums in Moscow and Pyongyang. Russian experts reportedly helped the North Koreans with the cosmetic aspects of political immortality. The streets of the North Korean capital reminded me of Moscow in the 1960s. Almost no traffic, just official cars whizzing down empty boulevards, curtains pulled shut to protect elite Communist party members from the prying eyes of pedestrians. In Moscow they used to drive long black Zils or Volgas. In Pyongyang, it's mostly older Mercedes, often an incongruous baby blue. In any country, one of the best ways to see how people live is to visit the food stores and markets. For several days we pestered our North Korean guides to take us to markets where the first tiny buds of capitalism are sprouting, the government allowing people to sell fruits and vegetables -- one way of relieving the food shortage in the North. In search of state-owned food stores, I went for a walk one evening in town, without a guide. The stores were closed, it was a holiday, but as I peered through the darkened window of one shop I went back in time to the stores I saw in Russia a quarter century ago. A few tin cans of fish stacked neatly in pyramids, a half-bare counter displaying a few lonely onions and cucumbers. This was in the capital, much better provisioned than the countryside, where North Koreans often go hungry. Choreographed encounters . In Russia, our guides went to extraordinary lengths to control what we saw and limit our interaction with average people. Mr. Jang and Mr. Song must have studied at the same guide school. Their mentality was the same: make sure we saw nothing that could reflect negatively on the government or Communist Party leadership. One morning, as we were driven out of Pyongyang to a mountain resort ensuring we would be kept far from any interaction with ordinary people, we asked our guides to let us stop by the road and shoot some pictures of the countryside. Grudgingly, they agreed. Suddenly, the young one, 29-year-old Mr. Jang, sporting a sleek black pompadour and a smirk, told us to stop. ""There is an old woman down there,"" he explained. Presumably, her bent back was not what he wanted on tape. Our older guide, Mr. Song, a former diplomat, was more flexible. He cracked a smile when I told him of how my Soviet escorts back in the 1970s took us on a boat ride down the Volga, refusing our pleas to stop along the way. At one deserted spot we were allowed to pull into shore for a picnic lunch. Several of us set off on foot to see what we could find. In a tiny village, we came upon a lovely young woman wearing makeup. When we complimented her on how nice she looked, she said: ""They told us you were coming."" Knowing that virtually every encounter is choreographed in advance creates a strange mind-warp. In Pyongyang we asked to see some of the everyday life in North Korea and our guides finally took us to the city park, a magnificently beautiful expanse of hills and trees. Hearing drumming in the distance, I walked swiftly to see where it was coming from. A few minutes away I spotted an open-air pavilion filled with older Koreans, most of them women in traditional flowing dress, cinched at the bust with a sash. They were singing, dancing and laughing uproariously, some of them beating out a rhythm on small red-painted drums shaped like an hourglass. I begin taking pictures. They simply smiled and kept dancing. Mr. Song caught up and we both surveyed the scene, utterly charming in its simplicity and gaiety. He turned to me with a smile and said, ""They knew you were coming."" Was he pulling my leg? Was he telling the truth? I guess I'll never know but I prefer to think that at least this encounter with Koreans was not scripted. The North may have a hard-edged image in the world of fierce militarism and, just as in the old Soviet Union, much of life is run like the army, with group -- not individual -- activities the norm. Yet, in spite of that hard-edged atmosphere, there is an incongruous feeling of primness, as well. In Pyongyang, 20-something traffic girls direct the non-existent traffic, robot-like in their white uniforms, black hair pulled back in identical World War II-style chignons. They remind me of little Russian girls in their starched school uniforms, organdy bows in their hair. Women in Moscow dressed neatly, but modestly, with no access to imported clothes. It's much the same here in Pyongyang yet there is one sign of changing times in today's North Korea: a flash, here and there, of modest jewelry, unthinkable just a short time ago. Following the Great Leader . How to understand what people really think and feel? It's a question I asked myself so many times in Russia and it hounds me here in North Korea. There was no way for our CNN crew to blend in, with our Western clothes, Western looks and our mandatory silk arm bands, given to us by our Foreign Ministry minders, navy blue with white lettering identifying us as journalists. In Russia, beneath the surface of repressive political control, if you looked hard enough, and spoke the language, you could sometimes find those lonely dissidents living in ""internal migration"" rejecting the pressure to conform. In North Korea, conformity is taken to a degree I never imagined possible. At the ""Airarang,"" the mass gymnastics show celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of Japanese occupation of Korea, thousands of performers dressed in military uniforms re-enact the battles and suffering that gave birth to their country. Before the show, a murmuring in the audience builds to a buzz. The personal photographers of Kim Jong Il suddenly appear close to the seat of honor. As the short, rotund leader enters the stadium, the audience leap to their feet, clapping rapturously as ""Dear Leader"" applauds them back. Do they believe in Kim? Believe in his ""juche"" philosophy of extreme self-reliance? Unable to speak Korean, cut off from unscripted meetings with Koreans, I have no answer. Young Mr. Jang tries to explain it to me: Korea, he says, is like a rabbit. ""Its face is toward China. Its back is toward the United States. Its ass is toward Japan. Its mouth is toward Russia."" Korea, he tells me, needs no one. Its unity is its weapon. Surrounded by enemies, it must look to itself to survive. In the mountains a two-hour drive from Pyongyang, there is a massive museum cut into the mountainside, built to house all the gifts given by international leaders to Kim Il Sung and his son, Kim Jong Il. I ask what is the first gift Kim Il Sung was given? The guide, an elegant woman in traditional dress, sweeps though the cold marble corridors, leading us to a room where a full-size train car stands, its elaborate wood interior and brass lamps buffed and polished, a gift from Soviet ruler Joseph Stalin. Down one more corridor to a final room on our tour, the diminutive guide tugs at the door and I gasp. A life-size figure of the Great Leader, dressed in a suit, standing amid trees near a lake, mountains in the distance. It is eerily real. Even the leaves on the trees rustle as a breeze (from a hidden fan?) blows by. The music is solemn, stately. Mr. Jang and Mr. Song stand reverently and bow. The Great Leader stares blindly into the distance. Does he know where his country is headed?","CNN correspondent recalls August 2005 visit to North Korea's capital .

"SAN ANTONIO, Texas (CNN) -- Last week in an operating room in Texas, a wounded American soldier underwent a history-making procedure that could help him regrow the finger that was lost to a bomb attack in Baghdad, Iraq, last year. Army Sgt. Shiloh Harris is wheeled into surgery for the experimental treatment to regrow what's left of his finger. Army Sgt. Shiloh Harris' doctors applied specially formulated powder to what's left of the finger in an effort to do for wounded soldiers what salamanders can do naturally: replace missing body parts. If it sounds like science fiction, the lead surgeon agreed. ""It is. But science fiction eventually becomes true, doesn't it?"" asked Dr. Steven Wolf of Brooke Army Medical Center. Harris' surgery is part of a major medical study of ""regenerative medicine"" being pursued by the Pentagon and several of the nation's top medical facilities, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Cleveland Clinic. Nearly $250 million has been dedicated to the research. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Israel Del Toro is one of the wounded vets who might one day benefit from this research. He was injured by a bomb in Afghanistan. Both his hands were badly burned. On his left hand, what was left of his fingers fused together. ""You know, in the beginning, when I first got hurt, I told them, just cut it off. So I can get some function,"" Del Toro said. His doctors did not cut off his injured left arm. And since that injury, advancements in burn and amputation treatment mean he may one day be able to use his fingers again.  Watch more on regenerative medicine » . A key to the research dedicated to regrowing fingers and other body parts is a powder, nicknamed ""pixie dust"" by some of the people at Brooke. It's made from tissue extracted from pigs. The pixie dust powder itself doesn't regrow the missing tissue; it tricks the patient's body into doing that itself. All bodies have stem cells. As we are developing in our mothers' wombs, those stem cells grow our fingers, toes, organs -- essentially, our whole body. The stem cells stop doing that around birth, but they don't go away. The researchers believe that the ""pixie dust"" can put those stem cells back to work growing new body parts. The powder forms a microscopic ""scaffold"" that attracts stem cells and convinces them to grow into the tissue that used to be there. ""If it is next to the skin, it will start making skin. If it's next to a tendon, it will start making a tendon, and so that's the hope, at least in this particular project, that we can grow a finger,"" Wolf said. It has worked in earlier experiments. ""They have taken a uterus out of a dog, made one in the lab, put it back in and had puppies,"" Wolf said. Researchers have also regrown a human bladder and implanted it in a person, and it is working as nature intended. Although the technique has incredible promise, doctors will be watching for unexpected side effects as they follow Harris' recovery. ""It could grow a cancer,"" Wolf said. ""We will be closely monitoring for that to make sure that doesn't happen."" If the military's most badly wounded start benefiting, so will civilians. ""If we can pull this off in missing parts the next step is, OK, can we grow a pancreas? Can we grow and replace that in a diabetic? And can we do the same thing with a kidney and can we do the same thing with a heart?"" One day, he hopes, people with heart trouble will be told, ""That's OK. We will just grow you another one."" ""That is something that is real science fiction.""

"(CNN) -- The families of two men allegedly gunned down by Aaron Hernandez won a partial victory Tuesday when a judge ruled that $5 million in assets from his home can be frozen pending the outcome of his double-murder trial and their lawsuit. The ruling preserves their right to possible collection of money in the future. The families are happy with the decision, an attorney said. ""They're gratified that the judge acknowledged the level of their loss by allowing the $5 million attachment,"" civil attorney Bill Kennedy told CNN. However, the ruling also means the families of Safiro Furtado and Daniel Abreu can't automatically lay claim to an estimated $3.3 million Hernandez claims he's still owed by his old NFL team if the New England Patriots should pay him. Prosecutors charge that in July 2012, Hernandez fired a .38-caliber gun into the victims' car after Abreu accidentally bumped into Hernandez, causing him to spill his drink. The suspected murder weapon has been recovered. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty. The Patriots are locked in a salary dispute with the NFL Players Association, which is reportedly taking Hernandez' position. In court testimony, the Patriots have taken the position they don't owe Hernandez any more money. The Patriots have declined comment to CNN on the matter. The organization has stipulated it would notify the court if it intends to pay Hernandez any additional money. ""The reality is the $3.3 million, that right to be paid, is probably the only money my (clients) will ever be able to see, "" Kennedy pleaded in a hearing last week before the judge. However, the court's written ruling also means the Furtado and Abreu families can pursue the Patriots to try to learn more about Hernandez' contract, including what he was paid and what he may be owed. In a separate civil lawsuit filed before the Boston case, the family of slaying victim Odin Lloyd also has a court attachment on Hernandez's home pending the outcome of the murder charge against Hernandez filed in June 2013. ""From their vantage point, all they can do from the civil perspective is to hold him (Hernandez) accountable civilly, "" Kennedy added. ""None of this will bring back their loved ones, they'll still have a loss. ... But the family has started this procedure to hold him civilly liable and they're doing that,"" he said. According to authorities, Hernandez paid just over $1 million for the home when he joined the Patriots in 2007. The family seeks to be paid up to $5 million each in value from the home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. Judge approves Aaron Hernandez jail move .

"(CNN) -- In the same-sex marriage debate, Elton John believes he knows where Jesus would've stood. The musician, who plans to marry his partner David Furnish next year, talked to Sky News on Sunday about how pleased he is with Pope Francis and how he wishes the Church of England would show greater support for his message. ""The new Pope has excited me so much by his humanity,"" John said. ""He's stripped it down to the bare bones and said it's all basically about love and taking everybody in, inclusiveness. And that has to be encouraged by the Church of England."" So when it comes to issues such as vows of celibacy for Catholic priests and gay clergymen being able to marry, John said the church needs to catch up with the times. ""These are old and stupid things, and the church hierarchy might be up in arms about it -- the traditionalists -- but times have changed,"" John said. ""We live in a different time. If Jesus Christ was alive today, I cannot see him, as the Christian person that he was and the great person that he was, saying this could not happen. ""He was all about love and compassion and forgiveness and trying to bring people together, and that is what the church should be about."" As far as coming together for John's nuptials, fans shouldn't expect a large affair. ""It'll be very quiet and very off the cuff,"" John said. ""But we will (marry), and I think it's a great opportunity to take advantage of the new laws, and to celebrate it.""","Elton John believes Jesus would support same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is aware of the controversy over the deal his country made with the Taliban to secure his release, and he's thankful that his commander in chief acted to save his life, his attorney said Wednesday. ""Sgt. Bergdahl has had a close brush with death over a prolonged period of time. He understands that his life has been saved. He's grateful to President Obama for doing that,"" Bergdahl's attorney, Eugene Fidell, told CNN's ""New Day."" Bergdahl, released by the Taliban six weeks ago, recently retained Fidell amid the Army's investigation into the circumstances of his disappearance and capture in Afghanistan in June 2009. The Army has said he has yet to be interviewed by the officer investigating his case, and he returned to regular duty at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, on Monday following weeks of counseling and medical care. The 28-year-old soldier spent five years in the hands of militants after he disappeared. He was released in late May in exchange for five senior Taliban members held by the U.S. military. Fidell said Bergdahl has ""gone through an extraordinary ordeal"" and ""lost five years in the most unspeakable way."" ""The mind boggles when thinking about spending five years in the hands of the Taliban,"" Fidell said. ""Imagine your worst nightmare. That's all I can say on that. ""Obviously the hope is that he can return to a normal life, and ... reintegrate properly within American society as well as the Army, and sort of get on with his life."" Fidell said he couldn't say much more about his conversations with Bergdahl, citing attorney-client privilege. Bergdahl venturing off base, rubbing elbows with public . The news of Bergdahl's freedom initially was met with jubilation, which quickly changed as many called for an investigation into his disappearance and captivity. Some critics accused the soldier of deserting his comrades in war. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after Bergdahl disappeared concluded that he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN. Fidell declined to answer CNN's question about Bergdahl's intent. Bergdahl back at work . Bergdahl spent his first day of regular duty working at the headquarters of U.S. Army North in Texas on Monday, the Army said. Like many soldiers at a new assignment, he spent much of his day getting paperwork straightened out, Army spokesman Don Manuszewski said. He began his job with a unit responsible for homeland defense, civil support operations and security cooperation programs involving countries such as Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas. He will eventually be given a position commensurate with his rank of sergeant. The army spokesman has said that Bergdahl would be assigned a desk job. Bergdahl lives on base, in a two-bedroom unit in noncommissioned officers' quarters. ""He's just another soldier in the U.S. Army,"" Manuszewski said. Two soldiers are helping him adjust to life at Fort Sam Houston. Bergdahl was a private first class when he was captured, and the Army extended his enlistment and twice promoted him on schedule while he was in captivity. Manuszewski wouldn't say how much longer Bergdahl's enlistment would last, and he didn't comment on the investigation. Army general to start investigating how, why Bergdahl left base .

"(CNN) -- Josephine and Jennifer Onita were returning from the wedding of a close friend in Nigeria. Maimuna Anyene was on her way to her brother's matrimonials. Weddings are a big reason people cross oceans and continents, making journeys brimming with mirth and laughter back to the lands where they and their families came from. This weekend, that joy plunged to absolute sorrow for at least two families in the United States. Anyene was killed along with her husband and four children when Dana Air Flight 992 crashed Sunday in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city. Aviation authorities suspend airline's license . Also on board were the Onita sisters from Missouri City, Texas: well-educated, smart and full of promise. ""I don't have anyone to talk to anymore,"" their elder sister, Christiana Onita-Olojo, said Tuesday. Her parents, Solomon and Lola Onita, came to the Houston area from Nigeria three decades ago, harboring the dream of all immigrants. Solomon opened a financial planning and tax office. Josephine, 23, often went by her middle name, Anita. She studied accounting at the University of North Texas and was managing all five locations of her father's business. She was a super-entrepreneur. Jennifer, 28, went to Texas Tech University and earned a degree in electrical engineering. She'd worked at Raytheon and as a contractor for NASA and was studying biomedical engineering. She was a bookworm, the kind of person who was quiet when she met a stranger but then talked up a storm. Ayo Akindona, a second cousin, was especially close to Jennifer. They grew up together in the same Missouri City neighborhood and spent many days at each other's houses. He used to love to brag to his friends: ""I know a rocket scientist."" Akindona said Josephine had gone shopping with his sister last Wednesday, before she left for Nigeria. The two women had their nails done and later, when they returned to Akindona's family home, they stayed up late talking. So late that Akindona's father broke up the conversation at 1 a.m. Josephine had been to Nigeria several times. Next time, she said, they would all go together. ""I walked her out to the door, waved bye,"" he said. ""I thought nothing of it."" Then at 5:30 Sunday evening, when Akindona was on his way to meet friends, his phone rang. It was his sister. Come home immediately, she said. Jennifer and Josephine had died in a plane crash. Akindona said he keeps waiting for someone to tell him it was a mistake. They weren't on that flight. Their phone ran out of battery power so they could not call. Something. Anything but the truth. Houston pastor Banji Adesanmi knew the Onita family through the Redeemed Christian Church of God, based in Nigeria. He had planned to take the doomed flight with the Onita sisters but changed his plans. ""I feel bad that I missed it and they did not,"" he said in an e-mail from Nigeria. ""They are younger and have a full life ahead of them."" All three Onita girls -- they have a younger brother, Solomon Jr. -- belonged to the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. But Onita-Olojo said there were no words to describe the sisterhood they shared by blood. Onita-Olojo said she spoke with her sisters every day, about everything. She had been anxious for them to return to Texas. Her husband had also attended the wedding in Abuja and had taken an earlier flight. Onita-Olojo didn't go because she had just given birth. Tuesday, her husband returned home. Her sisters didn't. She struggled for words. What do you say when parents lose two of their four children? And a sister loses her confidantes? She can see her sisters in her own daughter. Sometimes, she makes a face and looks like Josephine. Other times, she looks like Jennifer. ""I have to be strong,"" Onita-Olojo said, standing outside her door, speaking to a reporter from CNN affiliate KHOU. ""And pull it together for the family."" In another American city, far from the wreckage in Lagos, friends and family dealt with similar, gut-wrenching grief. Maimuna Anyene and her husband, Onyeke, were on their way from Hartford, Connecticut, to Lagos for her brother's wedding. They had with them their four children, including their youngest, just five months old. Her colleagues at United Technologies said Anyene had just returned from maternity leave to her job in the company's human resources division. She was an invaluable member of the team, a company statement said. ""She was a great, dedicated mom,"" said Sue Dombeck. ""We were all shocked yesterday."" Neighbors on Park Place Circle described Anyene as someone who always smiled, said hello. The community was in disbelief over the tragedy. An entire family -- gone. One neighbor, Tegan Gonzalez, placed flowers on Anyene's doorstep, the Hartford Courant reported. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said seven of the people on the flight were U.S. citizens. Officials were still working to notify all the families and had not released a final list. But one on that list is Peter Waxtan, the American pilot of the flight. Waxtan flew as a captain for Spirit Airlines from 1997 to 2009, according to the airline. ""All of us at Spirit are very saddened by this tragedy and extend our heartfelt condolences to all of his loved ones and the family and friends of everyone on the flight,"" said spokeswoman Misty Pinson. He also flew for Falcon Air Express, a charter airline in Miami, reported CNN affiliate WPEC. Friends expressed condolences on Facebook. ""R.I.P cap Peter Waxtan you will be missed,"" wrote Bassema Geha Zoghbi, whose profile said she works for customer services at Spirit Airlines. Waxtan had just started flying with Dana Air, said Oscar Wason, director of operations for the domestic Nigerian carrier. His first day was in March. CNN's Devon Sayers and Brian Walker contributed to this report.","Josephine and Jennifer Onita were smart and full of promise .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- If North Korea is the crying capital of the world, Nigeria holds the aces when it comes to smiling and laughing. It's not simply anecdotal evidence. Nigeria has been adjudged a happiness-ridden country at least twice in recent years. In 2003, the UK's New Scientist magazine conducted a survey that found that Nigeria had the highest percentage of happy people in the world. Seven years later, another survey, a Gallup poll this time, found that Nigeria had the world's highest rates of optimism. Now don't ask me about the methodology of measuring Gross Domestic Happiness, or assembling an Optimism Index. What is not in doubt is this: the appearance of Nigeria -- an oil-rich, natural-disaster-starved, fertile-land-suffused country where 70% of the population survives on less than $2 per day -- at the top of these surveys, seven years apart, must mean something. Months ago, while at school in England, a Taiwanese friend observed the enduring optimism of the Nigerian soul, telling me Nigerians were fond of saying things would work out fine. The Taiwanese, she explained, were a lot less sanguine. Decades ago Afrobeat musician and 'prophet' Fela Anikulapo Kuti saw this. The saxophone-wielding sociologist-of-the-streets recorded ""Suffering & Smiling'""as a testament to the never-say-die Nigerian spirit; to the remarkable capacity of the Nigerian soul to look beyond the prison wall and see, at midnight, a sun that not only hadn't risen but was not actually slated to rise. The song accuses organized religion (Christianity and Islam) of brainwashing Nigerians into a delusion-filled contentment with a dysfunctional status quo. ""Suffer suffer for world, enjoy for heaven,"" Fela chants, in that timeless masterpiece. Is a 'Nigerian Spring' next? Commercial buses in Lagos are mobile placards, bearing text drawn from Holy Books, local sayings and conventional wisdom. ""One with God is a majority."" ""The downfall of a man is not the end of his life."" ""It is well."" The most popular, ""No condition is permanent,"" says it all; succinctly capturing the psyche of a people who delight in trading grass-to-grace stories. Most fascinating are the ones that involve a sudden turn-around: the man who last week didn't know where the next meal was going to come from, but who today is feeding thousands at a party to celebrate his appointment as a Government minister. Pentecostal churches devote a chunk of their services of ""testimonies"" -- dramatic renderings of miraculous divine interventions. President Jonathan's most memorable campaign message involved juxtaposing his shoeless childhood with his adult influence. Yes, Obama did something similar (his father's humble beginnings in Kenya), but there was a difference: in Jonathan's version there was the subtext of a God-ordained destiny. It was no ordinary ""only-in-Nigeria-is-this-possible-by-dint-of-aspiration"" story. Nigerians, you see, are strong believers in the concept of a divinely-ordered ""destiny"" (not saying this is unique to us, though), strongly linked to the names we're given at birth. (We must be the only country in the world whose President is named ""Goodluck."") It is because of this gift of nature that you will find Nigerians insisting -- erroneously, of course -- that suicide, like homosexuality, and revolutionary uprising, is an un-Nigerian act. This explains why you'll find Nigerians who insist that the Christmas Day bomber failed not because he was incompetent, but because he was Nigerian, and couldn't process the thought of a self-inflicted death. And this is why, when a lone suicide bomber attacked the Nigeria Police headquarters in Abuja last June, early reports said he was from a neighboring country. Nigeria's oil economics fuel deadly protests . In light of the foregoing you can understand why, when the Arab spring commenced, a common topic of discussion amongst Nigerians was ""Is this possible in Nigeria?"" ""Can Nigerians rise up in protest against their governments?"" It was often asked in a rhetorical tone, questioner assuming the answer to be 'No'. Explanations would follow: Nigerians are too docile, too easily compromised, too steeped in hopes of an approaching -- and almost inevitable -- turn-around in their fortunes. There is apparently such a thing as an ""adjustment bureau"", founded, staffed and headquartered in Nigeria, which helps citizens, like the fabled frog, to consistently adjust to the rising temperature of boiling water. In our case until the time when, by divine intervention, the heat is turned off. It is therefore with surprise that I have observed, and participated in the series of public protest rallies now known as 'Occupy Nigeria' -- tens of thousands of Nigerians across the country and in the Diaspora, trooping to the streets to protest the insensitivity of a government that cut fuel subsidies benefiting a largely poor population whilst itself guilty of astonishing levels of profligacy. At one of the rallies, a man, told me that not even the protests that followed the annulment of the June 12, 1993 elections -- arguably the most significant act of subversion of the will of the Nigerian people in recent history -- drew such crowds. Had June 12 drawn those crowds, he said, things would have turned out differently. What is behind Nigeria fuel protest? So what has changed? What, in the collective Nigerian DNA, has undergone a mutation? Why are people trooping to the streets in an unprecedented manner, seeking to register their opposition. We'd have to turn to Tahrir Square in Cairo, and the Arab Spring, for some explanation. All of last year we were treated, via Al-Jazeera and CNN, to real-time scenes of dictators literally toppling from their thrones. Those images are powerful, and I think they filed themselves in our subconscious, awaiting such a moment as this. When the moment came, with the 110% rise in fuel prices on New Year's Day, I suspect that an exhuming started happening, of the buried images of people power from last year. Nigerians, with some tentativeness at first, and then with increasing boldness, seemed eager to not be left out of the wave of people power that has gripped their continent, everywhere from Tunis to Cairo to Kampala. Nigeria cuts fuel prices after national strike . And then of course the internet provided a platform for the accumulation and direction of the anger and frustration. While it may be true that the internet is currently being used only by a minority of Nigerians, it appears that that minority is more significant than we all assumed, because all of those online people are connected to the larger society, and are thus able to channel the information and energy that effortlessly pools online. The numbers I saw last week at the Gani Fawehinmi Memorial Park in Lagos were astonishing, and hugely inspiring. And it grew by the day. By Thursday the spots where my friends and I stood comfortably on Tuesday had been taken over. And this was happening in cities all across the country. It is still too early to know the full extent of what this means for Nigeria's rather uncertain future. But one thing is not in doubt, Nigerians, experts at suffering and smiling, surprised themselves last week. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tolu Ogunlesi .","Tolu Ogunlesi found 'God-ordained destiny' mindset used to stop Nigerians from uprising .
But to his surprise, recent protests against the fuel price hike proved something different .
The Arab Spring has inspired Nigerians to express their opposition, said Ogunlesi .

"(CNN) -- As an American, I am appalled by Dick Cheney and his relentless, pathetic and ultimately doomed effort to revise the history of his failures. But as a Democrat, I am thrilled that an incompetent, dishonest and reviled figure is hell-bent on making himself the face of the Republican Party, hogging the spotlight from rising stars like Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio -- and eclipsing more honorable Republicans from the Bush era, like Colin Powell. Cheney's endless media appearances, including this remarkable interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, reveal a nearly sociopathic refusal to admit any error, express any remorse, apologize for any mistake. And so let us review the Cheney record: No vice president has done more damage to our country, not even Vice President Aaron Burr, who shot and killed Alexander Hamilton 210 years ago. In the first months of the Bush-Cheney administration, Cheney was ordered to convene a task force on terrorism. Instead, he ignored the problem, the Cheney terror task force never met, and the warnings about an impending terrorist attack were ignored. Later, instead of apologizing, Cheney cravenly blamed the White House counterterrorism czar (PDF), Dick Clarke, who had tried to warn anyone who would listen that an attack was coming. ""Richard Clarke was the head of the counterterrorism program in the run up to 9/11,"" Cheney said. ""He obviously missed it."" Blaming the guy who did his job when you're the one who didn't do yours. From there, it was off to the races, as Cheney did and said anything to drag America into a war with Iraq. The good folks at Vox have compiled a damning indictment of Cheney's deep dishonesty about Iraq. In the interest of brevity, let me focus on a few lowlights: . He said the lead 9/11 hijacker ""did go to Prague, and he did meet with a senior official of the Iraqi intelligence service ... several months before the attack."" Wrong, according to a Senate Intelligence Committee report. He said Saddam had ""an established relationship with al Qaeda."" Wrong (PDF). Cheney claimed there was ""irrefutable evidence"" Saddam had reconstituted his nuclear program. Wrong. He said Saddam ""had an established relationship with al Qaeda, providing training to al Qaeda members in areas of poisons, gases and conventional bombs."" Wrong (PDF). He said there was ""overwhelming"" evidence of ties between al Qaeda and Iraq. Wrong. He said that we'd be ""greeted as liberators"" and that the insurgency was in its ""last throes"" nine years ago. Wrong and wrong. And that's just on Iraq. Need I mention that, as CEO of Halliburton, Cheney opposed President Clinton's sanctions on the terrorist regime in Iran, calling the Clinton administration ""sanctions-happy""? And he breezily defended doing business with the terrorists in Tehran -- through an overseas-based subsidiary -- explaining that ""the good Lord didn't see fit to always put oil and gas resources where there are democratic governments."" Need I mention he told Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill that ""deficits don't matter""? One can debate whether Cheney's misstatements were the result of willful mendacity or incompetence. I believe the former. But at a deeper level, it does not matter. Regardless of whether Cheney is a liar or a fool, thousands of heroic American troops are dead. Tens of thousands are injured. Iraq is a disaster -- and will be for years to come. And America is weaker and poorer because of Cheney. I know that powerful people don't like admitting error. But Hillary Clinton did so in her new book, candidly admitting that in voting for the Bush-Cheney war in Iraq, ""I got it wrong. Plain and simple."" Cheney, however, has no room for such candid introspection. When he turned 70, he was asked his greatest regret. He did not mention the death and devastation he brought to Iraq or that he and others ignored the terror threat before 9/11. He didn't mention his votes in Congress against banning plastic guns or opposing the release of Nelson Mandela. He said, ""My misspent youth.""  Seriously. A three-word oblique reference to a couple of drunken driving incidents a half century ago are the biggest regrets of this man's life. Other than that, Cheney sees his life as a flawless, virtuous existence. Were it not for the tragedies of 9/11 and Iraq, perhaps the thing Cheney would be remembered for was that he was the second vice president to shoot a man, albeit Cheney's was in a hunting accident and Harry Whittington, thank God, survived. Still, as a longtime quail hunter, I have no doubt Cheney was in the wrong. Every hunter is responsible for knowing where his buddies are. And Cheney violated a cardinal rule: He was drinking before he picked up the gun. (He claims to have had only one beer, but even one is too many when you're hunting.) But here's the thing: Even after Cheney shot him in the face, there's no indication he ever apologized to Harry Whittington. I suppose being a sociopath means never having to say you're sorry. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly indicated an affiliation between the Washington Post and the independent news website Vox.","Paul Begala says he is appalled by Dick Cheney and his relentless effort to revise history .
Begala: Cheney won't admit any error, misgiving or remorse or apologize for any mistake .
Begala: Cheney misled, lied and did anything to drag America into a war with Iraq .
He says whether Cheney is a liar or fool; thousands of troops are dead; Iraq is a disaster ."
"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- You may have watched in wonder as Germany dismantled Brazil on Tuesday. But to really appreciate the art of German football you need to understand the lingo. The sport has its own vocabulary and, as is common in the German language, most new terms are created by simply lumping several words together to make a 15 or 20 character monster word that would be an entire sentence in many other languages. So here is our guide to help you become an expert while watching Sunday's final. 1. First, start strong in defense. You need a great goalkeeper or a TEUFELSKERL (Devil's Man). He needs to command the penalty area, be the first to corner kicks and block shots and penalty kicks. German history is rich with great goalies from Sepp Maier to Bodo Illgner and Oliver Kahn all the way to today's man between the posts, Manuel Neuer. 2. If your goalkeeper does not perform he is laughed off as a FLIEGENFÄNGER (fly catcher). 3. Moving on to your defense, which is always the core of a German team. This is the ABWEHRRIEGEL (defensive barrier). 4. Great defenders have to excel at the BLUTGRAETSCHE (blood tackle) to take out attacking opponents. Prototypical German defenders have names like Guido Buchwald and Jürgen Kohler from the 1990 World Cup squad, who struck fear into most opponents. 5. There are also smaller more shifty defensive players who cannot be shaken off by attackers that are called WADENBEISSER (calf-biters), like Berti Vogts from the 1974 squad or Philip Lahm from today's team. Vogts earned the nickname the Terrier, like a little dog who never stops snarling around its enemy. 6. Think of the German midfield and you think of names like Lothar Mathäus, Michael Ballack, Stefan Effenberg or today's squad which is laden with talent including Bastian Schweinsteiger, Sami Khedira, Mesut Oezil, Toni Kroos, and Mario Götze. Great midfielders who lead teams are known as MITTELFELDREGISSEURE (midfield directors). 7. These midfielders must also be able to deliver perfect BANANENFLANKEN (banana passes), usually with the outside of their foot, setting the forwards free on goal. 8. And talking of the forwards, their main job is to score goals. You want a striker on your team who is a TORJÄGER (goal hunter). 9. But in order to be a great TORJÄGER he has to have a great TORRIECHER (goal nose), someone with the instinct to be in the right place at the right time. Germany is fortunate to have had two TORJÄGER with the same last name in Gerd Müller, who scored the decisive goal in the 1974 final against the Netherlands, and Thomas Müller of today's squad who was the top scorer in the 2010 World Cup and has five so far in Brazil. Then there was the current U.S. coach Jürgen Klinsmann who made his mark in the 1990 World Cup. 10. If your forwards and strikers have many chances but never seem to put the ball in the net, they will be dismissed as CHANCENTOD (death of chances). Believe it or not, Germany has had its share of these. 11. If you have your WADENBEISSER and TORRIECHER in your team, good for you. If not your team may be ridiculed as a GURKENTRUPPE (cucumber troop). 12. Or, even worse, a KARNEVALSVEREIN (carnival team). Brazil perhaps. Ultimately, to be German you need to temper success with pessimism and criticism. After a 7-1 victory over Brazil you have to warn against complacency in the final and you must acknowledge the team still has weaknesses. People from other countries often cannot understand this. It is why Americans were furious when Klinsmann said that the U.S. had no chance of winning the World Cup. He was not trying to be mean. He was just being German and guess what, he took team America further than most fans predicted. So here's to German football strategy, team lingo and pessimism, seeing themselves as the underdog against Argentina even after winning 7-1. Viel Spass beim Fussball!","Do you know your fly catcher from your banana pass?

But to be German, winning must be tempered with pessimism, says CNN's Fred Pleitgen ."
"Beijing (CNN) -- Getting divorced is never an easy thing, but a city district in northwestern China wants to make it just a bit harder. Since March 2012, the civil affairs bureau in Chang'an District of Xi'an City -- an urban area with more than 1 million residents -- has limited the number of divorce filings to no more than 15 a day. Couples eager to part ways but arriving too late are told to return together the next day. This little-known local rule became a hot topic nationwide last week after a divorcing couple failed to obtain a slot and complained to state media. Amid a barrage of criticisms of a wrongheaded government agency interfering with civil liberties, officials defended their ""well-intentioned"" system. ""It's aimed at saving families from impulsive divorces,"" Lin Wenhui, head of marriage registration at the Chang'an civil affairs bureau, told state media. ""Some couples, even after getting a slot, eventually decided not to file for divorce after having some time to calm down and think it through."" Chang'an isn't the only local government facing accusations of being overzealous in its effort to save marriages. In February, civil affairs officials in Xuzhou -- a city of 9 million people in eastern China -- stirred heated debate for deciding not to accept any divorce filings on Valentine's Day. Still, government statistics show divorce rates in China have soared in recent years. Last year, Xi'an -- where Chang'an District is located -- saw 17,670 couples go their separate ways amicably, while the number of divorces nationwide shot up to 3.5 million. Both figures represented an increase of more than 10% over 2012. Experts seem divided on the root causes. Some have pointed to a government report that says a quarter of married Chinese women have suffered various forms of domestic violence. Others have even referred to numerous news articles on couples ""fake-divorcing"" to skirt restrictions on the number of houses a family can legally buy in major cities.

"(Mental Floss) -- The ubiquity of the ""Joy of Cooking"" is staggering. More than 18 million copies have sold since the Great Depression -- when a Midwestern widow named Irma Rombauer published her recipes and anecdotes in the hope of lifting America's spirits. And while the lemonade concoctions and tuna casserole recipes were delicious, the real secret of the cookbook's success isn't that it soothed stomachs; it's that it catered to hearts and minds. The artist of life . Irma Rombauer's young life was uniquely charmed. She was born in 1877 to wealthy German immigrants and spent her teenage years shuttling between her hometown of St. Louis and the elegant port city of Bremen, Germany. After enjoying a brief tryst with novelist Booth Tarkington, Irma settled down and married an attorney, with whom she raised two children. Although never employed, she thought of herself as an ""artist of life,"" a renaissance woman who aspired to live vibrantly and suck the marrow out of every moment. When the stock market crashed in 1929, Irma's spirit was put to the test. Her husband, who'd long suffered from depression, committed suicide. But instead of wallowing in grief, the 54-year-old widow found meaning in a project -- writing a cookbook she titled ""The Joy of Cooking: A Collection of Reliable Recipes with a Casual Culinary Chat."" Once completed in 1931, she spent half her savings to publish the book locally in St. Louis. Friends and acquaintances tested the recipes, and the feedback was encouraging, so she began pitching it to major publishers. Five years later, in 1936, Bobbs-Merrill finally took a chance on it and agreed to distribute the ""Joy of Cooking"" nationwide. The truth is that Irma had never been a great chef, but she was an excellent hostess. She could whip up a party at a moment's notice and keep all of her guests entertained. By infusing the ""Joy of Cooking's"" text with that same wit and conviviality, Irma set her cookbook apart. From the first page, she skipped the kitchen basics in favor of extolling the virtues of cocktails: ""They loosen tongues and unbutton the reserves of the socially diffident. Serve them by all means, preferably in the living room, and the sooner the better."" Irma's German heritage also deeply influenced early editions of the book. The first Joy includes recipes for dishes such as blitzkuchen and linzer tortes and even a few rousing quotes from Goethe. Irma also exhibited an endearing frankness with her readers. Unlike any other cookbook narrator at the time, Irma admitted to her lack of expertise and joked about not having time to cook. In one section, she wrote, ""The German recipe reads, 'stir for one hour,' but of course, no high-gear American has time for that."" Simply stated, Irma Rombauer knew her audience. Mental Floss: 10 foods that are aphrodisiacs . Joy and depression . Other than maybe ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" no book grasped the hardships of the Great Depression better than the ""Joy of Cooking."" Irma understood that American housewives were struggling to put food on the table, and she addressed those challenges head on. Many entries began with the tag ""Inexpensive and good."" There was even an appendix on making the most of leftovers, including stale bread, bones, coffee grounds, and pickle vinegar. Along with these tidbits, Irma also included the food preferences of celebrities and monarchs. ""Is there anything better than good coffee cake?"" she wrote. ""I am told that the former king of Spain 'dunks.'"" These asides bore little culinary relevance, but they made readers believe they shared something in common with royalty and celebrities. Follow this recipe, Irma hinted, and you're making the same sponge cake that Queen Mary once made for King George V when he was under the weather. As the country marched off to WWII, the ""Joy of Cooking"" adapted to the times. Irma's 1943 edition was the first major cookbook to address the issue of rationing. Once again, she treated cutbacks as opportunities for innovation, creating recipes such as Butterless, Eggless, Milkless Cake. She even gave soybeans top billing, featuring them as a prime substitute for meat. Mental Floss: Food Challenges for the Super Hungry . Family tradition . By 1951, Irma was in her seventies, so her daughter, Marion Becker, took over the bulk of her work. In some ways, Marion was even more of a visionary than her mother, and many of her choices for the 1951 ""Joy of Cooking"" helped transform it into the classic it is today. For example, to illustrate techniques and ingredients, Marion added 150 line drawings. She could have chosen trendy photographs, but her decision to use simple, helpful sketches ensured that the book would feel timeless. By contrast, the technicolor cakes and sweaty roast turkeys of 1950's ""Betty Crocker's Picture Cookbook"" now feel dated. Marion also introduced a simple lowercase font for the logo. At the time, this was an understated choice; today, it's an icon of cookery. Like her mother, Marion also drew inspiration from the national mood. When the next edition of Joy was commissioned in 1963, the carefree consumer atmosphere of postwar America was over. Doctors no longer plugged cigarettes on TV, and books such as Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring"" dominated the shelves. To address growing consumer awareness, Marion cut some of Irma's digressions to make way for more relevant information. She included a massive section titled ""Know Your Ingredients,"" containing charts, diagrams, and exhaustive explanations on everything from the best way to beat eggs to how yeast works. The goal was to help readers understand not just the hows of cooking, but the whys, as well. Marion also wanted Americans to eat healthier, so she added nutritional advice to the pages of Joy. Plagued by undiagnosed food allergies as a child, she understood the link between ingredients and wellness years before people started talking about ""organic farming"" and ""health food."" Although the book still contained plenty of recipes for condensed-soup casseroles, 1963's Joy suggested using fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables instead of canned or frozen produce. In an era of Wonder Bread, Marion Becker pushed for whole grains. Marion produced her last revision in 1975 with the help of her husband, John, and son, Ethan. The work was a monumental tome, containing more than 4,500 recipes and 1,000 illustrations. Thanks to its encyclopedic size, this edition became the resource not only for grandmothers searching for German chocolate cake recipes, but also for their hippie grandchildren looking for tips on granola. Presciently, the book warned readers against overusing microwaves, which were embraced by most major cookbooks at the time. (Off the record, Marion actually wrote to Ralph Nader that she believed microwaves were zapping the nutritional value from food.) The 1975 Joy was considered so authoritative that it remained in print for more than 20 years. Mental Floss: Secret menu items at fast food restaurants . Today's tastes . In 1997, Scribner Books hired a team of chefs to write a completely new Joy without any input from the Becker family. Critics slammed the edition for being sterile and lacking any sense of playfulness. In 2006, the publisher made amends. Ethan Becker and his wife, Susan, were put in charge of the 75th anniversary edition, creating a new version that combined Marion Becker's conscientiousness with her mother's sense of fun. Instead of catering to weight-loss fads (the authors thank heaven that low-carb diets are no longer in vogue), the latest Joy stresses moderation and balance. The classic, gut-busting German cakes are still there, but they share space with homemade energy bars. Marion would be proud that ethnic cooking is finally represented on a level that reflects our culture, with recipes for hummus, cream cheese balls, and salsa on neighboring pages. Meanwhile, her mother would be happy that cocktails are back, along with old, quirky recipes, such as Lemonade for 100 People. And the tidbits are classically Irma. For example: ""The Romans, who were passionate about snails, grew them on ranches where they were fed special foods like bay leaves, wine, and spicy soups as pre-seasoning."" But to really grasp the spirit of the ""Joy of Cooking,"" one needs only to look at the index of the latest edition, which begins with a Samuel Johnson quote. It reads, ""Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information on it."" Irma would be proud. Mental Floss: World's 10 messiest food festivals .

"Memphis, Tennessee (CNN) -- They've been romanticized in movies and songs, but many people really do send messages in a bottle. Chad Pregracke has found 64 of them, accumulating what he believes to be one of the world's largest collections. The 2013 CNN Hero of the Year stumbled onto them while cleaning up the country's rivers. Since 1997, he and volunteers of his nonprofit, Living Lands & Waters, have removed more than 7 million pounds of debris from U.S. waterways. CNN sat down with Pregracke to find out more about his unusual collection and what's inside each bottle. CNN: How did you come to start this collection? Chad Pregracke: Well, I found my first one in 1997, the year I started. There was a large flood on the Mississippi in 1993, and some guys put a message in a bottle and they threw it in the river and I found it. It had a flag on it. And I just thought it was kind of cool, so I kept it. ... The second year, I found two or three more, and then I started to actually look for them. I try to keep as many as I can. ...It's pretty cool to find them because (for the most part) you never know how far they came, where they came from, who they came from. CNN: How do you find them? Pregracke: In my work, I see thousands of plastic bottles out there. But I'm always scanning, looking in every bottle for a piece of paper. You get psyched out a lot because people have stuffed napkins or wrappers in there. You get kind of excited and then, ""Oh no."" It's the ultimate thing to find out there. When you're working, you don't use that time to open it right then. You put it in (the) boat, think about it and then open it up and read it. There's usually a lot of anticipation for it, especially at a big cleanup. It's a romantic idea. And truthfully, most of them aren't like a treasure map. Usually they're more intimate. ... They're sort of writing to the universe or the one above, just putting their thoughts out there. CNN: What types of messages have you found? Pregracke: Oh, so many things. Some of them come hundreds of miles down the river or different rivers. ... Some of them have been found three or four times and passed on, and it'll keep going down the river and down the river. People will sign them and date them. I've found lottery tickets, parking tickets, dollar bills. We did find a treasure map, but there was no treasure, I checked. I found one from some guys going to the World Series when it was in Kansas City; that was like 10 years old. I found one from a girl who threw it in a stream in Lawrence, Kansas, and it made it to the Missouri River and then a couple hundred miles into the Mississippi River. That was cool. I found one for voodoo. It said, ""You are bound now,"" and it had a string that pulled the paper tight. ... The newest guy on our board, he was at a cleanup for about 10 minutes and he finds this message in a bottle. It had wax at the top so it wouldn't leak and all kinds of sparkles and stuff inside. I thought, ""This is going to be a good one."" We couldn't see inside the bottle. I got a knife and opened it. This stuff started blowing all over him. It turned out it was the ashes of somebody. It was like the movie ""The Big Lebowski."" But it was cool. There was a note about the guy who passed away, and it also had another note that said: ""If anyone finds this, you are so blessed. Thank you so much."" It was kind of neat that they decided to write a note to someone who might find it someday. CNN: Have you ever gotten in touch with anyone who has sent a message? Pregracke: Actually, there are fun ones who say, ""If you find this, call me."" I've called probably three to five of them over the years. Half of them forget they ever did it. The one that I most remember was a truck driver. He was smart, because he put some rocks in the bottle, which weighs it down, which means the current will carry it versus the wind. Anyway, his message gave his name and phone number, so I called him and said, ""Hey, you threw a message in a bottle."" And he said, ""I don't know what you're talking about."" And I said: ""Dude, this is you. It's your name. You must've thrown it off -- my guess is somewhere near Burlington, Iowa -- and I found it about 90 miles downriver."" And he said: ""Oh my God, I'm pulling over. I did that five or six years ago!"" He got superexcited. It made his week. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . CNN: Do you think it's the world's largest collection of its kind? Pregracke: It's the second-largest. I used to think it was the largest, but I just found out maybe a month ago that this dude down in Texas has 150 of them. He's a professor, and he has been documenting garbage on the ocean since 1978 -- not picking it up, just documenting it. So his collection is bigger. ... But we have found way more than 64 actually. If volunteers find them and want to keep them, I let them, so we've probably found about 50 more. I just don't have them. CNN: Do you have a favorite message? Pregracke: I do. It's a song that was written for guitar called ""Lavender Is You."" It was thrown into the Wabash River and then went into the Ohio River. It's a love song. It's sheet music. .... There's actually a lot of them that are pretty heavy, you know? They're not treasure maps, but they were written to a lost loved one. ... You don't want to keep it, because it was meant not to be kept. So you just kind of send those on, even though it feels weird letting a bottle go on.","CNN Hero Chad Pregracke has spent the past 15 years cleaning up U.S. waterways .

"(CNN) -- Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's release from Taliban captivity was largely celebrated at first. In the ensuing days, however, several serious issues about death, honor and the law have arisen, and those issues continue to grow. Is Bergdahl in military trouble? Any legal issues about Bergdahl, who's been accused of desertion, will be addressed once he has returned to U.S. soil. He's now being treated at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. A senior U.S. defense official said this week that Bergdahl has not been classified a deserter and is still scheduled to be promoted to the rank of staff sergeant later this month. ""We have not classified him as a deserter. At this point we do not have any understanding of why he left his camp that night"" in June 2009, the official said. Military officials need to hear Bergdahl's explanation of those events, the official said. He noted that the Army promoted Bergdahl in rank during his captivity. One expert, Geoffrey Corn, a professor at South Texas College of Law, said the accusations raise ""some very serious violations of the uniform code of military justice and arguably violations that led to the loss of life of members of his own unit in their efforts to recover him."" ""There's going to be a very deliberate and careful effort to develop the facts, although that also raises complicating issues related to whether or not he is entitled to a Miranda-type warning under the military code, which might lead him to say he doesn't want to talk about it at all,"" Corn said. Corn spent 22 years in the Army as an officer and civilian employee, with his last post as the Army's senior law of war expert in the office of the judge advocate general. Were U.S. soldiers killed searching for Bergdahl? There is controversy over whether soldiers were killed, directly or indirectly, in the search for Bergdahl after he was taken captive by the Taliban. Former soldiers involved in the operations to find Bergdahl asserted to CNN this week that at least six soldiers were killed in the search for Bergdahl in 2009. They provided the soldiers' names and their dates of death, with circumstances for some of them. A day later, Nathan Bradley Bethea, a former member of Bergdahl's battalion who searched for him that summer in 2009, wrote in the Daily Beast that eight soldiers' deaths were tied to the Bergdahl search. Bethea provided the eight soldiers' names -- including six names that CNN earlier reported. Pentagon and Army officials have looked at the claims, and ""right now there is no evidence to back that up,"" a U.S. official told CNN on Thursday. Asked about the accusations, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters Wednesday that he did not know of specific circumstances or details of soldiers dying as a result of the efforts to find Bergdahl. Bergdahl's former team leader, former Sgt. Evan Buetow, told CNN, ""I can't say for a fact and I don't know if there is really anyone who can prove that soldiers died on a directed mission to find Bergdahl. However every mission, especially in the following two or more months, those were directed missions. Everything after that, they were still missions that were in search of Bergdahl. ... Bergdahl leaving changed the mission."" Bowe Bergdahl: Strong, well-rounded and easy to talk to, friends say . Did Bergdahl desert? An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded that Bergdahl left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to a U.S. military official briefed on the report. The official spoke to CNN Tuesday on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information. There was no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier. The investigation included interviews with members of Bergdahl's unit, none of whom reported seeing him go, the official said. It is ""unfair"" to Bergdahl and his family to presume anything about his motivations for leaving the base, Hagel said Wednesday. Secretary of the Army John McHugh said Tuesday that ""a comprehensive, coordinated"" review of Bergdahl's case will be conducted. The review ""will include speaking with Sergeant Bergdahl to better learn from him the circumstances regarding his disappearance and captivity,"" McHugh said. Earlier in the week, Hagel declined to address directly detailed questions about Bergdahl's case -- particularly accusations that he deserted, as some of his former brothers-in-arms allege. Before he went missing, Bergdahl spoke of wanting to get lost in the mountains and walking to India, his comrades said. ""I believe he totally deserted,"" said former Staff Sgt. Justin Gerleve, Bergdahl's former squad leader. Opinion: Five tough ethics issues in Bergdahl swap . Did Obama break the law? Bergdahl's captors freed him in exchange for the release of five Taliban fighters held at the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but the Obama administration didn't tell Congress of the releases. Under law, the White House has to give a 30-day notice to Capitol Hill before any terrorists are transferred from Guantanamo. White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice defended President Obama's decision not to notify Congress. ""Given the acute urgency of the health condition of Sergeant Bergdahl, and given the President's constitutional responsibilities, it was determined that it was necessary and appropriate not to adhere to the 30-day notification requirement, because it would have potentially meant that the opportunity to get Sergeant Bergdahl would have been lost,"" Rice said. The president did indeed break the letter of the law, said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. But there are questions about the law itself, he added. ""There's two different questions here. One is, did he violate the federal law? The answer to that is most obviously yes,"" Turley said. ""The second question is whether that law is constitutional. And the answer to that is more difficult. ""This is just a notice requirement. There are thousands of such notice requirements. And the problem with the President's argument is there's no limiting principle, that he could argue that all national security laws could fall into the same unilateral power,"" Turley said. Hillary Clinton wanted tougher deal for Bergdahl . Did Bergdahl help the Taliban? There's no evidence that Bergdahl helped the enemy directly, though he's certainly been used in Taliban propaganda. What has partly fueled this accusation is how Bergdahl reportedly had sent e-mails to his parents denouncing U.S. activities in Afghanistan, according to a 2012 story in Rolling Stone magazine. Bergdahl's former comrades also wondered if he gave the Taliban intelligence because the enemy executed ""very calculated, very methodical"" strikes after Bergdahl's disappearance, said Buetow. But a U.S. official who has been briefed on the initial Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after Bergdahl disappeared told CNN that Bergdahl's commanders referred to him as ""a good soldier"" in that report. Some of his teammates said he had expressed ""boredom"" and thought his unit was too passive and should have been ""kicking down doors,"" the official said. Taliban video shows Bowe Bergdahl's release in Afghanistan . Was Bergdahl tortured? It's too early to say how severely Bergdahl was mistreated during his five years of captivity. Officials have yet to state the findings of their medical examination of Bergdahl following his release Saturday. A Taliban propaganda video of the handover of Bergdahl showed him looking gaunt and blinking repeatedly -- as if in disbelief or shock. ""He doesn't look that bad to me,"" remarked Chris Voss, a former FBI lead international hostage negotiator, about Bergdahl's condition. Some experts speculate Bergdahl may have experienced Stockholm syndrome, in which he may have emotionally bonded with his Taliban captors over the five years. Why is his unit coming out against him? There's something new and something old motivating the former members of Bergdahl's unit to condemn him. First there were the immediate reports that Bergdahl was being hailed as a hero. Those accounts incensed the former soldiers. The comrades also remembered 2009 and how they searched for Bergdahl. ""He walked off,"" said former Pfc. Jose Baggett, 27, of Chicago. ""He left his guard post. Nobody knows if he defected or he's a traitor or he was kidnapped. What I do know is, he was there to protect us, and instead he decided to defer from America and go and do his own thing. I don't know why he decided to do that, but we spent so much of our resources, and some of those resources were soldiers' lives."" In fact, the former soldiers say they are so outraged that they are speaking out publicly at significant peril. The former servicemen said they earlier signed nondisclosure agreements about the disappearance and search for Bergdahl, but they're now violating it. The six soldiers at center of Bergdahl debate . Is that illegal? The former soldiers may well be in open violation of that contract. But they say they will risk punishment. ""It's certainly a possibility, but I don't think that I could have continued to go on without being able to share with you and the people the true things that happened in this situation, because if you guys aren't made aware of it, it will just go on, he will be a hero, and nobody is going to be able to know the truth,"" said former Army Sgt. Josh Korder, whose back is tattooed with the names of three soldiers who purportedly died while searching for Bergdahl. Army officials didn't immediately return a CNN request for comment about what consequences, if any, the former soldiers may face if they're in violation of a nondisclosure agreement. For those former troops, honor is at stake. ""For me, he's a deserter. America needs to know,"" said Gerleve, the former squad leader. ""He's back, and he needs to be held accountable.""

"(CNN) -- Is this Manchester City's ""David Beckham moment?"" When Yaya Toure's agent announced his client was unhappy because the English Premier League champion's bosses failed to wish him happy birthday, social media went into meltdown. The 31-year-old, who earns a reported $370,000 a week, has been ridiculed after his agent revealed Toure was left upset by the lack of congratulations afforded to him. According to the player's agent, Toure was barely acknowledged by the club's owners when the squad arrived in the United Arab Emirates last week to celebrate their Premier League title triumph. ""None of them shook his hand on his birthday. It's really sick,"" his agent Dmitri Seluk told the BBC. But according to one PR expert, it's a case of a Premier League player wanting to have his cake and eat it; a case of professional footballers losing all touch with reality. ""I think it's a classic way of player trying to take control of club,"" Phil Hall, whose clients have included City, told CNN. ""He wants to be king of dressing room and fawned over. ""This is where it often goes wrong. It's the same as what happened with Beckham at Manchester United. ""In a few months, he was gone. The same happened with Eric Cantona. ""Jose Mourinho has dealt similarly with other players. When a player sees himself as bigger than the club, then it's time to part company."" It's unlikely Toure's behavior would have been tolerated at Manchester United under former manager Alex Ferguson. The Scot ruled Old Trafford with an iron fist and anyone who dared to challenge his authority was promptly shown the door. In his autobiography, Ferguson describes how Beckham, a global brand, had to leave after a heated exchange following a defeat by Arsenal in 2003. Beckham suffered a cut to his head after Ferguson kicked a boot at him following a dressing-room argument -- a moment which signaled the end of their relationship. ""The minute a Manchester United player thought he was bigger than the manager he had to go,"" Ferguson wrote in his book. ""David thought he was bigger than Alex Ferguson. It doesn't matter whether it's Alex Ferguson or Pete the Plumber. The authority is what counts."" While Beckham's brand was scarcely tarnished, Toure -- who signed a new four-year contract with City just 11 months ago -- could find himself in a far more problematic situation. His agent said the midfielder could leave City if he is not showed enough ""respect"" -- and the Ivory Coast star tweeted that he would make an announcement after the upcoming World Cup in Brazil. ""Man City is not respecting the player -- how can he be motivated to play for that team?"" Seluk told Sky Sports News. ""If they don't want Toure then he can leave at any moment. Many clubs would be interested in him."" According to Hall, the player's latest outburst is a sign that ""the tail is trying to wag the dog."" ""It's going to be very difficult for Yaya at Manchester City now,"" added Hall. ""When you do something like this then people start using it against you in different circumstances. ""Next time, when he fails to play because he's got a minor injury, people will start to doubt his commitment again and say, 'Oh, that's Yaya.' ""If he did have a problem then he should have dealt with it quietly. He now looks a bit sad."" Toure is not the first player to find himself embarrassed by his alleged excessive demands. Hall cites an example of one player who, having lost money on his property empire, demanded his club pay up the shortfall. Another, who had accrued large gambling debts, urged his club to pay off his creditors because it was having a negative impact on his performances. It's that type of high maintenance which has helped give footballers a bad name, according to Hall. ""Players need to understand that they are major brands,"" he added. ""I can't believe they don't employ specialist employers and just rely on their agent or friend. They need to understand they're working in the corporate world and not in Sunday League. ""Effectively, Toure has devalued himself already. Potential suitors will think they can acquire him on the cheap and it may do damage to his signing-on fee."" No cake -- but plenty of food for thought.","Yaya Toure's brand ""left damaged"" by outburst says PR expert .

"Washington (CNN) -- The federal government will no longer be housing unaccompanied minors from Central America at three military facilities. The Department of Health and Human Services, responsible for their care after they are taken into custody, announced the move on Monday, saying it has been able to find other types of locations for the some of tens of thousands of the children who have come from Central America. ""We are able to take this step because we have proactively expanded capacity to care for children in standard shelters, which are significantly less costly facilities. At the same time, we have seen a decrease in the number of children crossing the Southwest border,"" Ken Wolfe, a spokesman for the department, said in a statement. The temporary shelters were set up with the cooperation of the Defense Department in May and early June as the nation saw a major spike in the numbers of these children -- mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras -- crossing into the United States through Mexico. The three facilities were at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas, Fort Sill Army Base in Oklahoma and Naval Base Ventura County-Port Hueneme in California. Officials said they expect the children at Fort Sill to be moved by Friday and that the other two facilities to end operations in the next two to eight weeks. HHS said about 7,700 children were placed at the three bases. It is possible, HHS said, it would reopen the three military facilities if there is another surge. Internal Homeland Security Department figures showed more than 62,000 children had illegally come into the United States as of the end of last week during the past 10 months, according to a U.S. official. HHS' Administration for Children and Families is given responsibility for these kids after they are detained at the border. Right now, HHS said it will house the children both in standard as well as special surge facilities. The ultimate aim is to release the kids to sponsors -- often times family members if they have some living in the United States -- while their cases make it through the immigration system. That can take several years. Daniel's journey: How thousands of children are creating a crisis in America . CNN's Evan Perez contributed to this report.","Around 7,700 children have been sent to military bases in Texas, Oklahoma and California .

"(CNN) -- Republicans and Democrats raised serious concerns more than two years ago with the Obama administration about the possibility of swapping Taliban prisoners for captured Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl but said promised consultation never materialized. That disclosure on Tuesday illuminated congressional dismay with the White House over its decision to finally negotiate Bergdahl's release in exchange for the transfer of five men held at Guantanamo Bay to Qatar. A statement by House Speaker John Boehner referred to ""serious questions"" he and others raised in briefings that date back as far as late 2011 and in followup correspondence, and said promises of further discussions were ignored. ""Unfortunately, the questions and concerns we had were never satisfactorily answered and they remain today. At the time, the administration deferred further engagement because the prospects of the exchange had diminished,"" Boehner said. ""The administration provided assurances, publicly reiterated by the White House in June 2013, that its engagement with Congress would resume if the prospects for an exchange became credible again,"" Boehner said. Was Bergdahl swap legal? Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein said that she and the panel's vice chair, Saxby Chambliss, a Georgia Republican, were briefed on the administration's proposal in November 2011. A number of other top lawmakers in the House and Senate also received briefings, GOP aides said. The California Democrat said she and Chambliss wrote a classified letter to Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, in December of that year that was also signed by the leaders of the House Intelligence Committee. Feinstein said another letter went to President Barack Obama in January of 2012. ""Both letters registered concerns with the proposal and opposed the transfer of the detainees to Qatar,"" she said. The lawmakers received a ""comprehensive response"" from Clinton that included ""security assurances and a promise of consultation with the Congress,"" she said. GOP aides said other lawmakers also received a response from Clinton. But Feinstein, like Boehner, said she wasn't aware of any further consultation until receiving a call on Saturday from the administration saying that Bergdahl had been released and the terror detainees were on their way to Qatar. ""Given the past briefings and concerns we had addressed, and these were from both committees and the leadership of both committees, the concerns were bipartisan, and I strongly believe that we should have been consulted,"" she said. ""I think you can see that we're very dismayed about it,"" Feinstein said. She said the White House deputy national security adviser, Tony Blinken, called her to apologize for the lack of advance notice. Angry lawmakers cited a law signed by Obama requiring 30-day notice of plans to transfer prisoners from Guantanamo. Obama told reporters in Poland on Tuesday that the circumstances required an immediate decision within his authority as commander in chief. ""We have consulted with Congress for quite some time about the possibility we may have to execute a prisoner exchange,"" Obama said. ""We saw an opportunity and we were concerned about his health and had cooperation from the Qataris and we seized that. It was truncated to make sure we didn't miss that opportunity."" But Feinstein said there ""has not been even the weakest case"" made that Bergdahl's health required immediate action to negotiate his release, . In their previous correspondence with the administration, which CNN reviewed but was not allowed to copy, the lawmakers asked that a number of issues be addressed. They included precedent for such an exchange, the impact it would have on combat troops, and the risks of the five terror detainees returning to the battlefield. They also wanted to know whether the administration had exhausted all other options to secure Bergdahl's release before it pursued a possible exchange. In all discussions and the private communications about such a step, there were exchanges about possible conditions placed on the detainees -- including renouncing al Qaeda and violence in the region. But those terms were not included in the deal. Boehner said the administration's actions and lack of consultation with Congress merited further review, and supported House Armed Services Committee Chairman ""Buck"" McKeon's call for hearings.

"(CNN) -- It's a village not a town. So say residents of Bathurst, a magnet for the creative and curious located in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, approximately 12 kilometers from Port Alfred. Residents are proud of the eccentricity of their town. Or village. ""You've got to have certain things to be a town, like a bank and full-time doctor, and we don't have any of that,"" says one longtime resident who gives her name only as Mrs. Lens. What Bathurst does have is a history dating to the early 1820s, a long and entertaining main street and a pub with delicious food that's also a motel. The best time to visit is Sunday morning, for the weekly farmers market. But there are other attractions -- starting with these. Don't forget to tell us about your own underrated cities in the comment section. 1. World's largest pineapple . There's no missing the town's 17-meter-tall pineapple. It's not as random as it seems. The Big Pineapple represents the region's pineapple industry -- the settlers who arrived in the 1820s struggled to grow crops until the first pineapple was planted in 1865. Inside today's three-story fiberglass pineapple there's a museum devoted to the fruit. From the top there are great views of the surrounding pineapple fields and countryside. Tractor farm tours and pineapple tastings are also available. Big Pineapple, just off R67, Bathurst; + 27 46 625 0515; 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily . 2. South Africa's oldest pub . A pub is the focal point of Bathurst's history. Built in 1832 by British settler Thomas Hartley, it was known as Widow Hartley's Inn after his death. During World War II, a group of British RAF pilots decided it needed a cheerier moniker and renamed it the Pig and Whistle. The ""pig"" refers to an old drinking peg, or unit of alcohol, and the ""whistle"" is a corruption of the word ""wassail,"" meaning to drink and be merry. Although the pub has changed hands many times, the name stuck and it remains the oldest continually licensed pub in South Africa. The food is excellent, with fresh produce from neighboring farms. Pig and Whistle, 268 Kowie Road, Bathurst; + 27 46 625 0673 . 3. Offbeat and eccentric stores . As a community of artists, academics and musicians, many residents say they were attracted by the village's creative spirit. Some came for a weekend and never left. The Coathanger, a retro and vintage clothing store specializing in ""shabby chic,"" is one among a group of art galleries and craft shops with funky collections. The store feels like a museum -- old suitcases are stacked beside a 1970s toaster alongside piles of vinyl records and ""Boys Own"" annuals dating to the 1950s. Out front, the small lawn is bordered by lavender bushes and features a white ceramic toilet topped with a pair of black stilettos. ""The toilet? I'm going to plant strawberries in it,"" says owner Lindi Pieterse, as if it's the most obvious thing in the world. ""It's a sleepy little town, but it really comes to life on a Sunday -- that's when the hippies come out,"" says resident Marcel Pullen who runs a pottery studio and shop with her husband. ""People live here because they want to get away from it all and there are some really interesting people here, like the couple down the road that run the Dancing Donkey."" That would be paleontologist Rob Gess and his wife Serena, whose unusually named shop in a small thatched hut sells African arts and crafts made by local artisans, as well as Serena's own line of natural organic products. The Coathanger, Main Road, Bathurst; + 27 72 064 7002 . Richard Pullen Open Studio, 613 Kowie Road; + 27 46 625 0166 . The Dancing Donkey, Ndlambe, Bathurst . 4. Cheesy humor and kitsch memorabilia . Visitors encounter plenty of the village's cheesy humor. An advertisement for the Pig and Whistle boasts: ""There's no thirst like Bathurst."" Meanwhile, the pub door is inscribed with a bon mot of its own: ""Bathurst is a drinking village with a farming problem."" Inside, a wall is dedicated more wisecracks: ""Marriage is a relationship in which one person is always right and the other is the husband."" A leftover from early settlers, this is British wit at its silliest -- the sort found on old school seaside postcards and one-liners that might've gotten a rise out of Benny Hill. Souvenirs of these gags can be found at The Corner Art Gallery, which sells shirts that can be printed with the customer's name alongside the line ""Instant Idiot -- just add alcohol."" The gallery also sells beautiful ceramics, art and fabric prints. The Corner Gallery, corner of York and Trappes, Bathurst; + 27 46 625 0114 . 5. A museum of hoes and wagons . Ever wonder what an ostrich incubator looks like? Bathurst Agricultural Museum has the answer. Set up in 1970 to house old farming equipment, the museum now has more than 1,300 pieces on display, from ox wagons, old tractors and wagons to old dairy utensils and a steam engine.

"(CNN) -- She has been dreaming about this day for as long as I can remember. Ever since she was small, my daughter Lilach has fantasized about her wedding day. It took her a while, but it's finally becoming reality. At the age of 32, she has found the man with whom she wants to spend her life. He was born and raised right here in Nirim, Israel, the same kibbutz where she was born. They have known each other all their lives, but since they are two years apart, they never really paid much attention to each other as they were growing up. All this makes it all the more special. Our lives on the border with Gaza, in the western Negev Desert of Israel, are always tumultuous. There are times of running for shelters and explosions too close for comfort. But never has it been this sensitive, this close, this personally painful. Think about your own life. What is the worst thing that could happen to wedding plans? The caterer could suddenly go bankrupt? The weather could turn bad? Can you imagine having to worry that a rocket could blow up during the reception? Or planning for the prospect of a ""red-alert"" rocket-warning siren going off in the middle of the vows, sending family and friends scrambling in a panic for cover? This close to the border, we have no more than 15 seconds to make it to a shelter before the mortar explodes. This is our reality. The planning of the wedding, which has been going on for months, is an event Lilach had been working up to -- on one level or another -- for most of her life. The decision to marry here, on our kibbutz, by the pool, made my heart soar. They have been working on their plans painstakingly, doing much of the work on their own. They scrimped and saved, and had friends pitch in to decorate jars with lace and paint the wall at the amphitheater at the pool, all in order to prepare a simple, low-key, beautiful wedding. It was meant to be on their own terms, on their own turf. The place where they both were born; the place where they want to settle down and raise a brood of their own. See more wedding stories at CNN Matrimony . The wedding is set for the end of this week. Invitations have gone out and loved ones have RSVP'd. The caterer is set and the dress has been bought. Tables and chairs have been ordered. Their ceremony has been planned to the letter, with their friends and loved ones playing the leading roles. In short: everything is in place, all systems ""go."" The only thing is, given the events of the past few days, we literally have to go. We must move the venue, because there is no way we can risk endangering the lives of our guests. The current situation has escalated at a terrifying rate and we cannot take the risk. The wedding is now going to be held in Ga'ash, about an hour and a half away from the original venue. It is a beautiful, safe place in the middle of the country -- if there really is such a thing as a safe place here in this tiny land. They wanted a Friday evening wedding, to be married at sunset. It will now be in the afternoon because of logistical limitations. The victory of finding a safer location is bittersweet: there have not been any weddings on Nirim for years, and this was going to be a very special, symbolic occasion for our community as well as for our family. The ironic truth is that, of all my children, Lilach was the only one terrified of living here on the border with Gaza. She has suffered from nightmares and fears, refusing to walk around after dark on her own. This despite the fact that there is practically no crime in this community where everyone knows everyone else. She, of all the children, is the one child I never would have dreamt would be settling on Kibbutz Nirim to raise a family. Any of my other children? Maybe. But not Lilach. She was just too deeply certain that terrorists would infiltrate the kibbutz and pop up right under her window. For years she searched, trying to find life elsewhere: in the United States for a while, in the center of Israel -- anywhere but on the border with Gaza. Until she came back and fell in love with a man who wants to live no place else but here. Instead of celebrating the wedding of her dreams, we found ourselves confronted with the nightmare of having to find a secure location, and the additional significant expenses involved in moving the celebration to a safer environment. But we have taken those lemons and turned them into formidable lemonade. This is life on the border with the Gaza Strip: peaceful and welcoming most of the time, but occasionally, a battlefield with sirens and explosions. Occasionally a place where we hear bombs instead of wedding bells. Read more by Adele Raemer on CNN iReport.

"United Nations (CNN) -- As international anger grows over reports of mass carnage at the hands of the Syrian regime, a U.N. Security Council draft resolution condemning Syria failed to be adopted Saturday after veto-wielding members Russia and China voted against it. Ambassadors from the other permanent members of the council -- the United States, France, and the United Kingdom -- said they were furious at Russia and China for failing to halt the worsening, bloody violence that has consumed the Middle Eastern nation. Thirteen Security Council members voted in favor of the resolution. The vote was a major diplomatic setback for countries hoping to send a unified message to embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and also for opposition groups that look toward the United Nations for support. ""Those that have blocked potentially the last effort to resolve this peacefully ... will have any future blood spill on their hands,"" U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice told CNN. ""The people of Syria have yet again been abandoned by this Council and by the international community."" Some Syrians have cried out for international action to stop attacks on civilians, more so after opposition groups said at least 321 civilians were killed and hundreds wounded in the city of Homs in the past two days. The opposition Syrian National Council blamed government forces for the attack in Homs, calling it one of the most ""horrific massacres"" since the start of the Syrian uprising. Residential buildings and homes were ""randomly and heavily bombed,"" the group said. The Local Coordination Committees (LCC), a Syrian opposition group, said 90 people had been killed in Syria on Saturday, including 61 in Homs, 10 in Idlib, and 19 in a Damascus suburb. In a bid to pressure the government, the group called for a two-day civil strike to start on Sunday. Another opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported that 48 people were killed across Syria on Saturday, including six army defectors and 18 members of the Syrian security forces. CNN cannot independently confirm opposition or government reports from Syria because the government has restricted journalists' access to the country. Some residents accused the international community of sitting idle as bodies mount in the streets, and predicted worsening violence in the wake of the vote. ""We've been expected the U.N. to help us ... and they just left us like this,"" said an activist identified as Danny. ""Now this regime is going to hit us harder."" Syria's U.N. ambassador, Bashar Jaafari, said his country has been ""targeted by some powers seeking to punish it."" Jaafari called the crisis ""manufactured"" and said there is a media campaign to make the Syrian regime look bad. Following the vote, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said that diplomatic efforts are ongoing. France, its European and Arab partners are in talks to create a ""Group of Friends for the Syrian People,"" he said. In a strongly-worded statement before the vote, U.S. President Barack Obama said Syrian President al-Assad has lost all legitimacy and that the international community ""must work to protect the Syrian people from this abhorrent brutality."" He pointed the finger directly at al-Assad and what he called his ""killing machine."" On Saturday, funerals were held in Homs and residents worked to free bodies trapped under the rubble, said resident Abu Abdo Alhomsy. Snipers remained perched throughout the city, he said, complicating efforts. ""The blood of our children is not a game,"" Alhomsy said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the vote was a lost opportunity to halt the violence. The resolution would have demanded that al-Assad stop the killing and answer international calls aimed at finding a Syrian-led solution to the crisis. U.S. Ambassador Rice said the United States was ""disgusted"" at the veto by Russia and China. Referring to Russia, she said, ""This intransigence is even more shameful when you consider that one of these members continues to deliver weapons to Assad."" The Russian foreign minister has spoken in defense of Russian arm sales to Syria, saying they did not affect the regional balance of power. Russia, which counts Syria as a major weapons client, has made clear that it will not accept an arms embargo or economic sanctions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is scheduled to visit Damascus on Tuesday to meet with al-Assad, according to his ministry. British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said the United Kingdom was ""appalled"" at the veto. ""Those who blocked the council action today must ask themselves how many more deaths they will be prepared to tolerate,"" Lyall Grant said. It effectively means Russia and China ""support tyranny rather than the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people,"" he said. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the resolution supported Arab League efforts to resolve the crisis in Syria. ""It did not impose any sanctions, nor did it authorize military action,"" Hague said. ""There was nothing in the draft to warrant opposition."" Jaafari said such statements ""fan the flames of escalation of the violence and bloodshed"" and ""betray the true hostile, genuine intentions against Syria, the people of Syria, and the government of Syria."" All along, he said, ""the tone of their statements was not diplomatic ... when they describe the government of Syria as a 'regime' and addressed the president of the state of Syria with inappropriate language."" Speaking after the vote, ambassadors from both Russia and China said they do support an end to the violence but felt the resolution did not address the crisis properly. Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said the text ""did not adequately reflect the real state of affairs and sent an unbalanced signal"" to the various sides in Syria. He noted that the minister for foreign affairs will visit Damascus to hold a meeting with al-Assad in three days. Chinese Ambassador Li Baodong called on all parties in Syria to stop the violence and restore order as soon as possible. But he said the text would have served only to ""complicate the issue"" and would ""prejudge the result of dialogue."" China and Russia vetoed another Security Council resolution in October that would have called for an immediate halt to the crackdown, which United Nations officials have said has resulted in an estimated 6,000 deaths since protests began nearly a year ago. The LCC estimates that at least 7,339 people have been killed. ""Since these two members last vetoed a resolution on Syria, an estimated 3,000 more civilians have been killed,"" Rice said Saturday. Earlier Saturday, Tunisia said it would expel the Syrian ambassador from Tunis in response to the killings in Homs, while British Foreign Secretary Hague and his French counterpart Alain Juppe condemned the violence. Obama noted the violence in Homs came as the Syrian people were celebrating the birth of the Prophet Mohammed and marking 30 years since al-Assad's father oversaw a massacre in the city of Hama. The resolution voted on Saturday had dropped demands from an Arab League plan for Syria to form a unity government and for al-Assad to delegate power to his deputy. U.N. diplomats said the changes reflected a big concession to Russia, which had been reluctant to sign on to any plan that could be seen as a mandate for regime change in Damascus. Reports of the violence in Homs led to protests breaking out at Syrian embassies in Cairo, Berlin, Washington, Kuwait and London on Friday and Saturday. CNN's Yousuf Basil, Becky Brittain, Pierre Meilhan, Richard Roth, Mick Krever, Elise Labott, Salma Abdelaziz and Amir Ahmed, and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: Russian foreign minister is scheduled to meet with al-Assad this week .

"(CNN) -- Ben Affleck looks distinctly ill at ease. Portraying Nick Dunne—a man attempting to put out the dragnet for his missing-and-presumed dead wife Amy (played by British actress Rosamund Pike)—during a key scene in the adaptation of Gillian Flynn's bestselling crime thriller ""Gone Girl,"" Affleck has swapped his usual movie star luster for, well, flop sweat. In a sequence that was screened by director David Fincher exclusively for an EW cover story hitting newsstands Friday, Affleck's Dunne faces a candlelight vigil for Amy crawling with TV cameras, police detectives, and somber neighbors in the sequence, and he appears less like a grief-stricken husband than a shifty dude trying to seem grief-stricken. ""I may not behave the way the cameras want me to,"" Affleck tells a crowd that already views him as the prime suspect. ""If you need to mock somebody, mock me. But please don't turn this investigation into a circus."" ""Where's your wife, Nick?"" responded a voice from the darkness. ""What did you do to your pregnant wife?!"" Affleck, of course, knows the searing glare of the spotlight all too well, having comprised, along with J-Lo, the celebrity entity ""Bennifer."" To hear him tell it, portraying a guy who's being hounded by the press and second-guessed by a judgmental public hardly required extensive prep. ""It wasn't something I had to do a lot of research for,"" Affleck says with a weary smirk. ""I knew what it was like to have the tabloid world paying attention to me and ascribing negative motivations to whatever I might be engaging in. I knew what it was to be cast in a soap opera I had no control over."" Ben Affleck will be a great Batman, Adam West says . According to Fincher, Affleck's intimate familiarity with being misunderstood by the Fourth Estate— moreover, with ""what it's like to be hunted""—factored heavily in his casting. ""We knew we needed somebody who was charming and could be seductive, who could be a ladies man, a guy's guy, a frat boy,"" Fincher says. ""But most important, [someone] who had the wits and experience of knowing that situation. The gift of having Ben Affleck is that this is a guy who knows. He knows what a lose-lose situation is and understands what's funny about it, however sad."" See the original story at EW.com.
